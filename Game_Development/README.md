This is a very old game I made in highschool that would 100% get numerous copyright claims. It has to be opened using constuct2.
It can then be opened in a web browser from the "engine" if you can even call it that. You play as the millineum falcon and try
to navigate an astroid field for as long as possilbe. I don't work on it much anymore but I remember it fondly and was one of my
first projects so enjoy!
