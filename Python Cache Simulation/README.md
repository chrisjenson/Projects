ELC 463 Lab 1 Completed 3/16/21 Grade: 26.97/29

The purpose of this laboratory is to study, via simulation, the performance of memory management policies and memory configurations for cache memory systems.

Python was used to simulate the performance of different cache models on supplied TRACE files. Likely some errors in this one but the verilog implementation of this project should be correct and matches closely
