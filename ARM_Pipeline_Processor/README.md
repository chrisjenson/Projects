Pipelined ARM Processor written in Verilog. See WortsJensonCELab2Report.pdf  for more info

ELC 463 Lab 2
Completed 3/16/21
Grade: 28/28

Problem Statement:
In this laboratory, the pipelined ARM architecture will be implemented and verified in Verilog® using an as high as possible level of abstraction design methodology. This implementation will only have to support the following instructions (simplified ISA): 
  memory-reference instructions: LDUR, STUR 
  arithmetic-logical instructions: ADD, SUB, AND, ORR 
  control flow instructions: CBZ 


The LAB 3 report is also included because the source files are unavailable. 
ELC 463 Lab 3
Completed 4/6/21
Grade: 28/28

Problem Statement:
In this laboratory, the implementation of the pipelined ARM architecture developed in Lab #2 will be augmented to include a Forwarding Unit and a Hazard Detection Unit. The design will be implemented and verified in Verilog® using an as high as possible level of abstraction design methodology
