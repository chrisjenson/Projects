This is lab 3 for TCNJ ELC363 with Dr. Hernandez. Note that the code must be changed between simulation and synthesis. 
In synthesis, the variables c_in and c_out should be commented due to input and output conflict. The memory in this lab 
is atrifical so change the allocated amount to a more reasonable number for the targeted device. To see a better implementation 
of a processor, see lab 5. This lab does produce valid waveforms but is not done in an optimal way. The report received
a 55/57. The points lost because we entered wrong values for the timing simulation which resulted in unacceptable timing
report values. The other point was because the enables were being passed to the datapath unnessecarily.
