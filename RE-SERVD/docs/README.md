## Quick Summary

The app is used for charity and humanitarian organizations to relay their volunteer opportunities to students through an organized, moderated database.

This requires 3 types of accounts: administrator, organization, and student.

### Administrator
  * Global privileges for moderation purposes
  * Is an organization of its own, to create specific events

### Organization
  * Adds details regarding their organization - address, contact & other operations
  * Creates 'opportunities' of upcoming events that students can view

### Student
  * Views various opportunities and organizations that have been approved by the administrators
  * Favorite specific events for easy return
