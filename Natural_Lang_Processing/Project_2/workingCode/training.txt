<s> the second and more recent sense of the word art is as an abbreviation for creative art or fine art </s>
<s> fine art means that a skill is being used to express the artist creativity or to engage the audience aesthetic sensibilities or to draw the audience towards consideration of the finer things </s>

<s> likewise if the skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way it will be considered commercial art instead of fine art </s>
<s> on the other hand crafts and design are sometimes considered applied art </s>
<s> some art followers have argued that the difference between fine art and applied art has more to do with value judgments made about the art than any clear definitional difference </s>
<s> however even fine art often has goals beyond pure creativity and self-expression </s>
<s> the purpose of works of art may be to communicate ideas such as in politically spiritually or philosophically motivated art to create a sense of beauty see aesthetics to explore the nature of perception for pleasure or to generate strong emotions </s>

<s> because of the size and duration of these civilizations more of their art works have survived and more of their influence has been transmitted to other cultures and later times </s>
<s> some also have provided the first records of how artists worked </s>
<s> for example this period of greek art saw a veneration of the human physical form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature poise beauty and anatomically correct proportions </s>
<s> in byzantine and medieval art of the western middle ages much art focused on the expression of biblical and nonmaterial truths and used styles that showed the higher unseen glory of a heavenly world such as the use of gold in the background of paintings or glass in mosaics or windows which also presented figures in idealized patterned flat forms </s>
<s> nevertheless a classical realist tradition persisted in small byzantine works and realism steadily grew in the art of catholic europe </s>
<s> renaissance art had a greatly increased emphasis on the realistic depiction of the material world and the place of humans in it reflected in the corporeality of the human body and development of a systematic method of graphical perspective to depict recession in a three-dimensional picture space </s>
<s> in the east islamic art rejection of iconography led to emphasis on geometric patterns calligraphy and architecture </s>
<s> further east religion dominated artistic styles and forms too </s>
<s> india and tibet saw emphasis on painted sculptures and dance while religious painting borrowed many conventions from sculpture and tended to bright contrasting colors with emphasis on outlines </s>
<s> china saw the flourishing of many art forms jade carving bronzework pottery including the stunning terracotta army of emperor qin poetry calligraphy music painting drama fiction </s>
<s> chinese styles vary greatly from era to era and each one is traditionally named after the ruling dynasty </s>
<s> so for example tang dynasty paintings are monochromatic and sparse emphasizing idealized landscapes but ming dynasty paintings are busy and colorful and focus on telling stories via setting and composition </s>
<s> japan names its styles after imperial dynasties too and also saw much interplay between the styles of calligraphy and painting </s>
<s> woodblock printing became important in japan after the num century </s>
<s> the western age of enlightenment in the num century saw artistic depictions of physical and rational certainties of the clockwork universe as well as politically revolutionary visions of a post-monarchist world such as blake portrayal of newton as a divine geometer or david propagandistic paintings </s>
<s> this led to romantic rejections of this in favor of pictures of the emotional side and individuality of humans exemplified in the novels of goethe </s>
<s> the late num century then saw a host of artistic movements such as academic art symbolism impressionism and fauvism among others </s>
<s> the history of twentieth century art is a narrative of endless possibilities and the search for new standards each being torn down in succession by the next </s>
<s> thus the parameters of impressionism expressionism fauvism cubism dadaism surrealism can not be maintained very much beyond the time of their invention </s>
<s> increasing global interaction during this time saw an equivalent influence of other cultures into western art such as pablo picasso being influenced by african sculpture </s>
<s> japanese woodblock prints which had themselves been influenced by western renaissance draftsmanship had an immense influence on impressionism and subsequent development </s>
<s> later african sculptures were taken up by picasso and to some extent by matisse </s>
<s> similarly the west has had huge impacts on eastern art in the num and num centuries with originally western ideas like communism and post-modernism exerting a powerful influence on artistic styles </s>
<s> modernism the idealistic search for truth gave way in the latter half of the num century to a realization of its unattainability </s>
<s> relativism was accepted as an unavoidable truth which led to the period of contemporary art and postmodern criticism where cultures of the world and of history are seen as changing forms which can be appreciated and drawn from only with irony </s>
<s> furthermore the separation of cultures is increasingly blurred and some argue it is now more appropriate to think in terms of a global culture rather than regional cultures </s>
<s> art tends to facilitate intuitive rather than rational understanding and is usually consciously created with this intention </s>
<s> fine art intentionally serves no other purpose </s>
<s> as a result of this impetus works of art are elusive refractive to attempts at classification because they can be appreciated in more than one way and are often susceptible to many different interpretations </s>
<s> in the case of ricault raft of the medusa special knowledge concerning the shipwreck that the painting depicts is not a prerequisite to appreciating it but allows the appreciation of ricault political intentions in the piece </s>
<s> even art that superficially depicts a mundane event or object may invite reflection upon elevated themes </s>
<s> traditionally the highest achievements of art demonstrate a high level of ability or fluency within a medium </s>
<s> this characteristic might be considered a point of contention since many modern artists most notably conceptual artists do not themselves create the works they conceive or do not even create the work in a conventional demonstrative sense </s>
<s> art has a transformative capacity it confers particularly appealing or aesthetically satisfying structures or forms upon an original set of unrelated passive constituents </s>
<s> the creative arts are often divided into more specific categories each related to its technique or medium such as decorative arts plastic arts performing arts or literature </s>
<s> unlike scientific fields art is one of the few subjects that are academically organized according to technique </s>
<s> an artistic medium is the substance or material the artistic work is made from and may also refer to the technique used </s>
<s> for example paint is a medium used in painting and paper is a medium used in drawing </s>
<s> an art form is the specific shape or quality an artistic expression takes </s>
<s> the media used often influence the form </s>
<s> for example the form of a sculpture must exist in space in three dimensions and respond to gravity </s>
<s> the constraints and limitations of a particular medium are thus called its formal qualities </s>
<s> to give another example the formal qualities of painting are the canvas texture color and brush texture </s>
<s> the formal qualities of video games are non-linearity interactivity and virtual presence </s>
<s> the form of a particular work of art is determined by the formal qualities of the media and is not related to the intentions of the artist or the reactions of the audience in any way what so ever </s>
<s> a genre is a set of conventions and styles within a particular medium </s>
<s> for instance well recognized genres in film are western horror and romantic comedy </s>
<s> genres in music include death metal and trip hop </s>
<s> genres in painting include still life and pastoral landscape </s>
<s> a particular work of art may bend or combine genres but each genre has a recognizable group of conventions s and tropes </s>
<s> one note the word genre has a second older meaning within painting genre painting was a phrase used in the num to num centuries to refer specifically to paintings of scenes of everyday life and can still be used in this way </s>
<s> the style of an artwork artist or movement is the distinctive method and form followed by the respective art </s>
<s> any loose brushy dripped or poured abstract painting is called expressionistic </s>
<s> often a style is linked with a particular historical period set of ideas and particular artistic movement </s>
<s> so jackson pollock is called an abstract expressionist </s>
<s> because a particular style may have specific cultural meanings it is important to be sensitive to differences in technique </s>
<s> roy lichtenstein num num paintings are not pointillist despite his uses of dots because they are not aligned with the original proponents of pointillism </s>
<s> lichtenstein used ben-day dots they are evenly spaced and create flat areas of color </s>
<s> dots of this type used in halftone printing were originally used in comic strips and newspapers to reproduce color </s>
<s> lichtenstein thus uses the dots as a style to question the high art of painting with the low art of comics to comment on class distinctions in culture </s>
<s> lichtenstein is thus associated with the american pop art movement num </s>
<s> pointillism is a technique in late impressionism num developed especially by the artist georges seurat that employs dots that are spaced in a way to create variation in color and depth in an attempt to paint images that were closer to the way people really see color </s>
<s> both artists use dots but the particular style and technique relate to the artistic movement adopted by each artist </s>
<s> these are all ways of beginning to define a work of art to narrow it down </s>
<s> imagine you are an art critic whose mission is to compare the meanings you find in a wide range of individual artworks </s>
<s> how would you proceed with your task </s>
<s> one way to begin is to examine the materials each artist selected in making an object image video or event </s>
<s> the decision to cast a sculpture in bronze for instance inevitably effects its meaning the work becomes something different from how it might be if it had been cast in gold or plastic or chocolate even if everything else about the artwork remains the same </s>
<s> next you might examine how the materials in each artwork have become an arrangement of shapes colors textures and lines </s>
<s> these in turn are organized into various patterns and compositional structures </s>
<s> in your interpretation you would comment on how salient features of the form contribute to the overall meaning of the finished artwork </s>
<s> but in the end the meaning of most artworks is not exhausted by a discussion of materials techniques and form </s>
<s> most interpretations also include a discussion of the ideas and feelings the artwork engenders </s>
<s> art can connote a sense of trained ability or mastery of a medium </s>
<s> art can also simply refer to the developed and efficient use of a language to convey meaning with immediacy and or depth </s>
<s> art is an act of expressing feelings thoughts and observations </s>
<s> there is an understanding that is reached with the material as a result of handling it which facilitates one thought processes </s>
<s> a common view is that the epithet art particular in its elevated sense requires a certain level of creative expertise by the artist whether this be a demonstration of technical ability or an originality in stylistic approach such as in the plays of shakespeare or a combination of these two </s>
<s> traditionally skill of execution was viewed as a quality inseparable from art and thus necessary for its success for leonardo da vinci art neither more nor less than his other endeavors was a manifestation of skill </s>

<s> at the turn of the num century the adroit performances of john singer sargent were alternately admired and viewed with skepticism for their manual fluency yet at nearly the same time the artist who would become the era most recognized and peripatetic iconoclast pablo picasso was completing a traditional academic training at which he excelled </s>
<s> a common contemporary criticism of some modern art occurs along the lines of objecting to the apparent lack of skill or ability required in the production of the artistic object </s>
<s> in conceptual art marcel duchamp fountain is among the first examples of pieces wherein the artist used found objects ready-made and exercised no traditionally recognized set of skills </s>
<s> tracey emin my bed or damien hirst the physical impossibility of death in the mind of someone living follow this example and also manipulate the mass media </s>
<s> emin slept and engaged in other activities in her bed before placing the result in a gallery as work of art </s>
<s> hirst came up with the conceptual design for the artwork but has left most of the eventual creation of many works to employed artisans </s>
<s> hirst celebrity is founded entirely on his ability to produce shocking concepts </s>
<s> the actual production in many conceptual and contemporary works of art is a matter of assembly of found objects </s>
<s> however there are many modernist and contemporary artists who continue to excel in the skills of drawing and painting and in creating hands-on works of art </s>
<s> somewhat in relation to the above the word art is also used to apply judgments of value as in such expressions as that meal was a work of art the cook is an artist or the art of deception the highly attained level of skill of the deceiver is praised </s>
<s> it is this use of the word as a measure of high quality and high value that gives the term its flavor of subjectivity </s>
<s> making judgments of value requires a basis for criticism </s>
<s> at the simplest level a way to determine whether the impact of the object on the senses meets the criteria to be considered art is whether it is perceived to be attractive or repulsive </s>
<s> though perception is always colored by experience and is necessarily subjective it is commonly understood that what is not somehow aesthetically satisfying can not be art </s>
<s> however good art is not always or even regularly aesthetically appealing to a majority of viewers </s>
<s> in other words an artist prime motivation need not be the pursuit of the aesthetic </s>
<s> also art often depicts terrible images made for social moral or thought-provoking reasons </s>
<s> for example francisco goya painting depicting the spanish shootings of num of may num is a graphic depiction of a firing squad executing several pleading civilians </s>
<s> yet at the same time the horrific imagery demonstrates goya keen artistic ability in composition and execution and produces fitting social and political outrage </s>
<s> thus the debate continues as to what mode of aesthetic satisfaction if any is required to define art </s>
<s> the assumption of new values or the rebellion against accepted notions of what is aesthetically superior need not occur concurrently with a complete abandonment of the pursuit of what is aesthetically appealing </s>
<s> indeed the reverse is often true that the revision of what is popularly conceived of as being aesthetically appealing allows for a re-invigoration of aesthetic sensibility and a new appreciation for the standards of art itself </s>
<s> countless schools have proposed their own ways to define quality yet they all seem to agree in at least one point once their aesthetic choices are accepted the value of the work of art is determined by its capacity to transcend the limits of its chosen medium to strike some universal chord by the rarity of the skill of the artist or in its accurate reflection in what is termed the zeitgeist </s>
<s> art is often intended to appeal to and connect with human emotion </s>
<s> it can arouse aesthetic or moral feelings and can be understood as a way of communicating these feelings </s>
<s> artists express something so that their audience is aroused to some extent but they do not have to do so consciously </s>
<s> art may be considered an exploration of the human condition that is what it is to be human </s>
<s> art has had a great number of different functions throughout its history making its purpose difficult to abstract or quantify to any single concept </s>
<s> this does not imply that the purpose of art is vague but that it has had many unique different reasons for being created </s>
<s> some of these functions of art are provided in the following outline </s>
<s> the different purposes of art may be grouped according to those that are non-motivated and those that are motivated levi-strauss </s>
<s> the non-motivated purposes of art are those that are integral to being human transcend the individual or do not fulfill a specific external purpose </s>
<s> aristotle said imitation then is one instinct of our nature </s>
<s> in this sense art as creativity is something humans must do by their very nature no other species creates art and is therefore beyond utility </s>
<s> motivated purposes of art refer to intentional conscious actions on the part of the artists or creator </s>
<s> these may be to bring about political change to comment on an aspect of society to convey a specific emotion or mood to address personal psychology to illustrate another discipline to with commercial arts to sell a product or simply as a form of communication </s>
<s> the functions of art described above are not mutually exclusive as many of them may overlap </s>

<s> as of the english wikipedia has administrators </s>
<s> in the very early days of wikipedia all users functioned as administrators to perform various administrative functions using a single password that was handed out fairly freely </s>
<s> the modern form of administratorship is the result of a code modification which changed from password access to role-based access control under which individual accounts can be flagged as per the roles they could perform which in turn determined they could access </s>
<s> during this transition it was emphasized that administrators should never develop into a special subgroup </s>
<s> rather administrators should be a part of the community like other editors with no special powers or privileges when acting as editors </s>
<s> administrators are also expected to observe a high standard of conduct </s>
<s> likewise in general most maintenance and administration aspects of wikipedia can be conducted by anyone without the specific technical functions granted to administrators </s>
<s> an often paraphrased comment about the title and process of administratorship was made by jimmy wales in february num referred to as sysops here </s>
<s> stated simply while the correct use of the tools and appropriate conduct should be considered important merely being an administrator should not be </s>
<s> whether this description remains eight years after it was first is a matter of continuing debate </s>
<s> nonetheless it is still a useful adage </s>
<s> note each individual wikimedia project including other wikipedias may have its own policy for granting adminship </s>
<s> the english wikipedia has no official requirements you must meet to become a wikipedia administrator </s>
<s> anyone can apply regardless of their wikipedia experience </s>
<s> administrators are expected to uphold the trust and confidence of the community however and considerable experience is usually expected </s>
<s> each editor will personally assess their confidence in a particular candidate readiness in their own way </s>
<s> before requesting or accepting a nomination candidates should generally be active and regular wikipedia contributors for at least several months be familiar with the procedures and practices of wikipedia respect and understand its policies and have gained the general trust of the community </s>
<s> if at this point you are interested in requesting adminship you should first read the guide to requests for adminship and the nomination instructions </s>
<s> when you are ready to apply you may add your nomination to the requests for adminship rfa page according to the aforementioned instructions </s>
<s> a discussion not a vote will then take place among fellow editors about whether you should become an administrator </s>
<s> after seven days a bureaucrat will determine if there is consensus to approve your request </s>
<s> this is sometimes difficult to ascertain and is not a numerical measurement but as a general descriptive rule of thumb most of those above num approval pass and most of those below num fail </s>
<s> only one account of a given person may have administrative tools </s>

<s> uninvolved administrators can also help in the management of arbitration committee remedies and the dispute resolution concerning chronic disruptive areas and situations </s>
<s> administrators acting in this role are neutral they do not have any direct involvement in the issues they are helping people with </s>
<s> lists can be found at general sanctions and arbitration enforcement requests and the related arbitration enforcement noticeboard </s>
<s> two main noticeboards exist on which general administrator discussion takes place any user may post or take part in discussions there </s>
<s> if you are granted access you must exercise care in using these new functions especially the ability to delete pages and to block users and ip addresses </s>
<s> you can learn how to do these things at the administrators how-to guide and the new administrator school </s>
<s> please also look at the pages linked from the administrators reading list before using your administrative abilities </s>
<s> occasional lapses are accepted but serious or repeated lapses may not always be </s>
<s> administrator tools are also used with judgement it can take some time for a new administrator to learn when it best to use the tools and it can take months to gain a good sense of how long a period to set when using tools such as blocking and page protection in difficult disputes </s>
<s> new administrators are strongly encouraged to start slowly and build up experience on areas they are used to and by asking others if unsure </s>
<s> administrators and all other users with extra tools are expected to have a strong password to prevent damage in the case of a compromised account </s>
<s> administrators are expected to lead by example and to behave in a respectful civil manner in their interactions with others </s>
<s> administrators are expected to follow wikipedia policies and to perform their duties to the best of their abilities </s>
<s> occasional mistakes are entirely compatible with adminship administrators are not expected to be perfect </s>
<s> however sustained or serious disruption of wikipedia is incompatible with the status of administrator and consistently or egregiously poor judgment may result in the removal of administrator status </s>

<s> administrators should bear in mind that at this stage in the evolution of wikipedia they have hundreds of colleagues </s>
<s> therefore if an administrator finds that he or she can not adhere to site policies and remain civil even toward users exhibiting problematic behavior while addressing a given issue then the administrator should bring the issue to a noticeboard or refer it to another administrator to address rather than potentially compound the problem by poor conduct of his or her own </s>
<s> administrators are accountable for their actions involving administrator tools and unexplained administrator actions can demoralize other editors who lack such tools </s>
<s> subject only to the bounds of civility avoiding personal attacks and reasonable good faith editors are free to question or to criticize administrator actions </s>
<s> administrators are expected to respond promptly and civilly to queries about their wikipedia-related conduct and administrator actions and to justify them when needed </s>
<s> administrators who seriously or repeatedly act in a problematic manner or have lost the trust or confidence of the community may be sanctioned or have their access removed </s>
<s> in the past this has happened or been suggested for </s>
<s> it is extremely important that administrators have strong passwords and follow appropriate personal security practices </s>
<s> because they have the potential to cause site-wide damage with a single edit a compromised admin account will be blocked and its privileges removed on grounds of site security </s>
<s> in certain circumstances the revocation of privileges may be permanent </s>
<s> discretion on resysopping temporarily desysopped administrators is left to bureaucrats who will consider whether the rightful owner has been correctly identified and their view on the incident and the management and security including likely future security of the account </s>
<s> administrators should never share their password or account with any other person for any reason </s>
<s> if they find out their password has been compromised or their account has been otherwise compromised even by an editor or individual they know and trust they should attempt to change it immediately or otherwise report it to a steward for temporary de-sysopping </s>
<s> users who fail to report unauthorized use of their account will be desysopped </s>
<s> unauthorized use is considered controversial circumstances and access will not be automatically restored </s>
<s> in general editors should not act as administrators in cases in which they have been involved </s>
<s> this is because involved administrators may have or may be seen to have a conflict of interest in disputes they have been a party to or have strong feelings about </s>
<s> involvement is generally construed very broadly by the community to include current or past conflicts with an editor or editors and disputes on topics regardless of the nature age or outcome of the dispute </s>
<s> one important caveat is that an administrator who has interacted with an editor or topic area purely in an administrative role or whose prior involvement are minor or obvious edits which do not speak to bias is not involved and is not prevented from acting in an administrative capacity in relation to that editor or topic area </s>
<s> this is because one of the roles of administrators is precisely to deal with such matters at length if necessary </s>
<s> warnings calm and reasonable discussion and explanation of those warnings advice about community norms and suggestions on possible wordings and approaches do not make an administrator involved </s>
<s> in cases which are straightforward blatant vandalism the community has historically endorsed the obvious action of any administrator even if involved on the basis that any reasonable administrator would have probably come to the same conclusion </s>
<s> although there are exceptions to the prohibition on involved editors taking administrative action it is best practice in cases where an administrator may be seen to be involved that they pass the matter to another administrator via the relevant noticeboards </s>
<s> a user seeking administrator or uninvolved user help may use the template to request assistance </s>
<s> requests will appear in category requests for uninvolved help until removed </s>
<s> if a user thinks an administrator has acted improperly against or another editor he or she should express their concerns directly to the administrator responsible and try to come to a resolution in an orderly and civil manner </s>
<s> however if the matter is not resolved between the two parties users can take further action see dispute resolution process below </s>
<s> for more possibilities see administrators noticeboard incidents and requests for comment use of administrator privileges </s>
<s> note if the complaining user was blocked improperly by an administrator they may appeal the block email the arbitration committee directly </s>
<s> administrators are expected to have good judgment and are presumed to have considered carefully any actions or decisions they carry out as administrators </s>
<s> administrators may disagree but except for clear and obvious mistakes administrative actions should not be reversed without good cause careful thought and if likely to be objected usually some kind of courtesy discussion </s>
<s> when another administrator has already reversed an administrative action there is very rarely any valid reason for the original or another administrator to reinstate the same or similar action again without clear discussion leading to a consensus decision </s>
<s> wheel warring is when an administrator action is reversed by another admin but rather than discussing the disagreement administrator tools are then used in a combative fashion to undo or redo the action </s>
<s> with very few exceptions once an administrative action has been reverted it should not be restored without consensus </s>
<s> do not repeat a reversed administrative action when you know that another administrator opposes it </s>
<s> do not continue a chain of administrative reversals without discussion </s>
<s> resolve admin disputes by discussing </s>
<s> wheel warring usually results in an immediate request for arbitration </s>
<s> sanctions for wheel warring have varied from reprimands and cautions to temporary blocks to desysopping even for first time incidents </s>
<s> there have been several relevant arbitration cases on the subject of wheel-warring </s>
<s> the term was also used historically for an administrator improperly reversing some kinds of very formal action </s>
<s> wikipedia works on the spirit of consensus disputes should be settled through civil discussion rather than power wrestling </s>
<s> there are few issues so critical that fighting is better than discussion or worth losing your own good standing for </s>
<s> if you feel the urge to wheel war try these alternatives </s>
<s> there are a few exceptional circumstances to this general principle </s>
<s> note these are one-way exceptions </s>
<s> if an administrator abuses administrative powers these powers can be removed </s>
<s> administrators may be removed either by jimmy wales stewards or by a ruling of the arbitration committee </s>
<s> at their discretion lesser penalties may also be assessed against problematic administrators including the restriction of their use of certain powers or placement on administrative probation </s>
<s> the technical ability to remove administrator status rests with stewards and jimmy wales </s>
<s> there have been several procedures suggested for a community based desysop process but none of them have achieved consensus </s>
<s> some administrators will voluntarily stand for reconfirmation under certain circumstances see administrator recall </s>
<s> users may use dispute resolution to request comment on an administrator suitability </s>

<s> see bugzilla </s>
<s> administrators may request that their access to administrative tools be removed at m steward </s>
<s> administrators who stepped down in good standing that is not in controversial circumstances may request their administrator status be restored at any time by a bureaucrat </s>
<s> this is commonly done at the bureaucrats noticeboard </s>
<s> some administrators may become inactive for a period of time or may retire altogether </s>
<s> in these instances as noted on the perennial proposals page consensus has been that they will retain their rights unless they specifically request to have them removed </s>
<s> in most cases disputes with administrators should be resolved with the normal dispute resolution process </s>
<s> if the dispute reflects seriously on a user administrative capacity blatant misuse of administrative tools gross or persistent misjudgement or conduct issues or dialog fails then the following steps are available </s>
<s> some administrators place themselves open to recall whereby they pledge to voluntarily step down if a certain number of editors in good standing request so </s>
<s> the specific criteria are set by each administrator for themselves and is usually detailed in their userspace </s>
<s> the process is entirely voluntary and administrators may change their criteria at any time or decline to adhere to previously made recall pledges </s>
<s> if an administrator steps down as a result of a recall he or she then requests removal at m steward </s>
<s> misuse of administrator access or behavior that is incompatible with adminship may result in an involuntary request for comment on administrator conduct </s>
<s> administrators who fail to satisfactorily respond to community feedback are likely to become the subject of an arbitration committee review see below </s>
<s> this is an involuntary process </s>
<s> generally the arbitration committee requires that other steps of dispute resolution should be tried before it intervenes in a dispute </s>
<s> however if the matter is serious enough the arbitration committee may intervene without a request for comment on administrator conduct or other steps </s>
<s> remedies that may be imposed at the discretion of the committee include warnings admonishments restrictions or a summary removal of administrator privileges </s>

<s> arithmetic or arithmetics from the greek word number is the oldest and most elementary branch of mathematics used by almost everyone for tasks ranging from simple day-to-day counting to advanced science and business calculations </s>
<s> it involves the study of quantity especially as the result of combining numbers </s>
<s> in common usage it refers to the simpler properties when using the traditional operations of addition subtraction multiplication and division with smaller values of numbers </s>
<s> professional mathematicians sometimes use the term higher arithmetic when referring to more advanced results related to number theory but this should not be confused with elementary arithmetic </s>
<s> the prehistory of arithmetic is limited to a very small number of small artifacts which may indicate conception of addition and subtraction the best-known being the ishango bone from central africa dating from somewhere between and bc although its interpretation is disputed </s>
<s> the earliest written records indicate the egyptians and babylonians used all the elementary arithmetic operations as early as num bc </s>
<s> these artifacts do not always reveal the specific process used for solving problems but the characteristics of the particular numeral system strongly influence the complexity of the methods </s>
<s> the hieroglyphic system for egyptian numerals like the later roman numerals descended from tally marks used for counting </s>
<s> in both cases this origin resulted in values that used a decimal base but did not include positional notation </s>
<s> although addition was generally straightforward multiplication in roman arithmetic required the assistance of a counting board to obtain the results </s>
<s> early number systems that included positional notation were not decimal including the sexagesimal base num system for babylonian numerals and the vigesimal base num system that defined maya numerals </s>
<s> because of this place-value concept the ability to reuse the same digits for different values contributed to simpler and more efficient methods of calculation </s>
<s> the continuous historical development of modern arithmetic starts with the hellenistic civilization of ancient greece although it originated much later than the babylonian and egyptian examples </s>
<s> prior to the works of euclid around num bc greek studies in mathematics overlapped with philosophical and mystical beliefs </s>
<s> for example nicomachus summarized the viewpoint of the earlier pythagorean approach to numbers and their relationships to each other in his introduction to arithmetic </s>
<s> greek numerals derived from the hieratic egyptian system also lacked positional notation and therefore imposed the same complexity on the basic operations of arithmetic </s>
<s> for example the ancient mathematician archimedes devoted his entire work the sand reckoner merely to devising a notation for a certain large integer </s>
<s> the gradual development of hindu-arabic numerals independently devised the place-value concept and positional notation which combined the simpler methods for computations with a decimal base and the use of a digit representing zero </s>
<s> this allowed the system to consistently represent both large and small integers </s>
<s> this approach eventually replaced all other systems </s>
<s> in the early num century ad the indian mathematician aryabhata incorporated an existing version of this system in his work and experimented with different notations </s>
<s> in the num century brahmagupta established the use of zero as a separate number and determined the results for multiplication division addition and subtraction of zero and all other numbers except for the result of division by zero </s>
<s> his contemporary the syriac bishop severus sebokht described the excellence of this system as valuable methods of calculation which surpass description </s>
<s> the arabs also learned this new method and called it hesab </s>
<s> although the codex vigilanus described an early form of arabic numerals omitting zero by num ad fibonacci was primarily responsible for spreading their use throughout europe after the publication of his book liber abaci in num </s>
<s> he considered the significance of this new representation of numbers which he styled the method of the indians latin modus indorum so fundamental that all related mathematical foundations including the results of pythagoras and the algorism describing the methods for performing actual calculations were almost a mistake in comparison </s>
<s> in the middle ages arithmetic was one of the seven liberal arts taught in universities </s>
<s> the flourishing of algebra in the medieval islamic world and in renaissance europe was an outgrowth of the enormous simplification of computation through decimal notation </s>
<s> various types of tools exist to assist in numeric calculations </s>
<s> examples include slide rules for multiplication division and trigonometry and nomographs in addition to the electrical calculator </s>
<s> although decimal notation may conceptually describe any numerals from a system with a decimal base it is commonly used exclusively for the written forms of numbers with arabic numerals as the basic digits especially when the numeral includes a decimal separator preceding a sequence of these digits to represent a fractional part of the number </s>
<s> in this common usage the written form of the number implies the existence of positional notation </s>
<s> for example denotes num hundreds num plus num tens num plus num units num plus num tenths num num plus num hundredths num num </s>
<s> the conception of zero as a number comparable to the other basic digits and the corresponding definition of multiplication and addition with zero is an essential part of this notation </s>
<s> algorism comprises all of the rules for performing arithmetic computations using this type of written numeral </s>
<s> for example addition produces the sum of two arbitrary numbers </s>
<s> the result is calculated by the repeated addition of single digits from each number that occupies the same position proceeding from right to left </s>
<s> an addition table with ten rows and ten columns displays all possible values for each sum </s>
<s> if an individual sum exceeds the value nine the result is represented with two digits </s>
<s> the rightmost digit is the value for the current position and the result for the subsequent addition of the digits to the left increases by the value of the second leftmost digit which is always one </s>
<s> this adjustment is termed a carry of the value one </s>
<s> the process for multiplying two arbitrary numbers is similar to the process for addition </s>
<s> a multiplication table with ten rows and ten columns lists the results for each pair of digits </s>
<s> if an individual product of a pair of digits exceeds nine the carry adjustmentincreases the result of any subsequent multiplication from digits to the left by a value equal to the second leftmost digit which is any value from one to eight num num num </s>
<s> additional steps define the final result </s>
<s> similar techniques exist for subtraction and division </s>
<s> the creation of a correct process for multiplication relies on the relationship between values of adjacent digits </s>
<s> the value for any single digit in a numeral depends on its position </s>
<s> also each position to the left represents a value ten times larger than the position to the right </s>
<s> in mathematical terms the exponent for the base of ten increases by one to the left or decreases by one to the right </s>
<s> therefore the value for any arbitrary digit is multiplied by a value of the form num with integer the list of values corresponding to all possible positions for a single digit is written as </s>
<s> repeated multiplication of any value in this list by ten produces another value in the list </s>
<s> in mathematical terminology this characteristic is defined as closure and the previous list is described as closed under multiplication </s>
<s> it is the basis for correctly finding the results of multiplication using the previous technique </s>
<s> this outcome is one example of the uses of number theory </s>
<s> the basic arithmetic operations are addition subtraction multiplication and division although this subject also includes more advanced operations such as manipulations of percentages square roots exponentiation and logarithmic functions </s>
<s> arithmetic is performed according to an order of operations </s>
<s> any set of objects upon which all four arithmetic operations except division by zero can be performed and where these four operations obey the usual laws is called a field </s>
<s> addition is the basic operation of arithemetic </s>
<s> in its simplest form addition combines two numbers the addends or terms into a single number the sum of the numbers </s>
<s> adding more than two numbers can be viewed as repeated addition this procedure is known as summation and includes ways to add infinitely many numbers in an infinite series repeated addition of the number one is the most basic form of counting </s>
<s> addition is commutative and associative so the order the terms are added in does not matter </s>
<s> the identity element of addition the additive identity is num that is adding zero to any number yields that same number </s>
<s> also the inverse element of addition the additive inverse is the opposite of any number that is adding the opposite of any number to the number itself yields the additive identity num </s>
<s> for example the opposite of num is num so </s>
<s> if a and b are the lengths of two sticks then if we place the sticks one after the other the length of the stick thus formed is </s>
<s> subtraction is the opposite of addition </s>
<s> subtraction finds the difference between two numbers the minuend minus the subtrahend </s>
<s> if the minuend is larger than the subtrahend the difference is positive if the minuend is smaller than the subtrahend the difference is negative if they are equal the difference is zero </s>
<s> subtraction is neither commutative nor associative </s>
<s> for that reason it is often helpful to look at subtraction as addition of the minuend and the opposite of the subtrahend that is </s>
<s> when written as a sum all the properties of addition hold </s>
<s> there are several methods for calculating results some of which are particularly advantageous to machine calculation </s>
<s> for example digital computers employ the method of two complement </s>
<s> of great importance is the counting up method by which change is made </s>
<s> suppose an amount p is given to pay the required amount q with p greater than rather than performing the subtraction and counting out that amount in change money is counted out starting at q and continuing until reaching although the amount counted out must equal the result of the subtraction the subtraction was never really done and the value of might still be unknown to the change-maker </s>
<s> multiplication is the second basic operation of arithmetic </s>
<s> multiplication also combines two numbers into a single number the product </s>
<s> the two original numbers are called the multiplier and the multiplicand sometimes both simply called factors </s>
<s> multiplication is best viewed as a scaling operation </s>
<s> if the real numbers are imagined as lying in a line multiplication by a number say greater than num is the same as stretching everything away from zero uniformly in such a way that the number num itself is stretched to where was </s>
<s> similarly multiplying by a number less than num can be imagined as squeezing towards zero </s>
<s> again in such a way that num goes to the multiplicand </s>
<s> multiplication is commutative and associative further it is distributive over addition and subtraction </s>
<s> the multiplicative identity is num that is multiplying any number by num yields that same number </s>
<s> also the multiplicative inverse is the reciprocal of any number except zero zero is the only number without a multiplicative inverse that is multiplying the reciprocal of any number by the number itself yields the multiplicative identity </s>
<s> the product of a and b is written as a b or a when a or b are expressions not written simply with digits it is also written by simple juxtaposition ab </s>
<s> in computer programming languages and software packages in which one can only use characters normally found on a keyboard it is often written with an asterisk a </s>
<s> division is essentially the opposite of multiplication </s>
<s> division finds the quotient of two numbers the dividend divided by the divisor </s>
<s> any dividend divided by zero is undefined </s>
<s> for positive numbers if the dividend is larger than the divisor the quotient is greater than one otherwise it is less than one a similar rule applies for negative numbers </s>
<s> the quotient multiplied by the divisor always yields the dividend </s>
<s> division is neither commutative nor associative </s>
<s> as it is helpful to look at subtraction as addition it is helpful to look at division as multiplication of the dividend times the reciprocal of the divisor that is a b a </s>
<s> when written as a product it obeys all the properties of multiplication </s>
<s> the term arithmetic also refers to number theory </s>
<s> this includes the properties of integers related to primality divisibility and the solution of equations in integers as well as modern research that is an outgrowth of this study </s>
<s> it is in this context that one runs across the fundamental theorem of arithmetic and arithmetic functions </s>
<s> a course in arithmetic by jean-pierre serre reflects this usage as do such phrases as first order arithmetic or arithmetical algebraic geometry </s>
<s> number theory is also referred to as the higher arithmetic as in the title of harold davenport book on the subject </s>
<s> primary education in mathematics often places a strong focus on algorithms for the arithmetic of natural numbers integers rational numbers fractions and real numbers using the decimal place-value system </s>
<s> this study is sometimes known as algorism </s>
<s> the difficulty and unmotivated appearance of these algorithms has long led educators to question this curriculum advocating the early teaching of more central and intuitive mathematical ideas </s>
<s> one notable movement in this direction was the new math of the num and num which attempted to teach arithmetic in the spirit of axiomatic development from set theory an echo of the prevailing trend in higher mathematics </s>
<s> addition is a mathematical operation that represents combining collections of objects together into a larger collection </s>
<s> it is signified by the plus sign </s>
<s> for example in the picture on the right there are num num meaning three apples and two other which is the same as five apples </s>
<s> therefore num num num </s>
<s> besides counting fruits addition can also represent combining other physical and abstract quantities using different kinds of numbers negative numbers fractions irrational numbers vectors decimals and more </s>
<s> addition follows several important patterns </s>
<s> it is commutative meaning that order does not matter and it is associative meaning that when one adds more than two numbers order in which addition is performed does not matter see summation </s>
<s> repeated addition of num is the same as counting addition of num does not change a number </s>
<s> addition also obeys predictable rules concerning related operations such as subtraction and multiplication </s>
<s> all of these rules can be proven starting with the addition of natural numbers and generalizing up through the real numbers and beyond </s>
<s> general binary operations that continue these patterns are studied in abstract algebra </s>
<s> performing addition is one of the simplest numerical tasks </s>
<s> addition of very small numbers is accessible to toddlers the most basic task num num can be performed by infants as young as five months and even some animals </s>
<s> in primary education children learn to add numbers in the decimal system starting with single digits and progressively tackling more difficult problems </s>
<s> mechanical aids range from the ancient abacus to the modern computer where research on the most efficient implementations of addition continues to this day </s>
<s> addition is written using the plus sign between the terms that is in infix notation </s>
<s> the result is expressed with an equals sign </s>
<s> for example </s>
<s> the sum of a series of related numbers can be expressed through capital sigma notation which compactly denotes iteration </s>
<s> for example </s>
<s> the numbers or the objects to be added in general addition are called the terms the addends or the summands this terminology carries over to the summation of multiple terms </s>
<s> this is to be distinguished from factors which are multiplied </s>
<s> some authors call the first addend the augend </s>
<s> in fact during the renaissance many authors did not consider the first addend an addend at all </s>
<s> today due to the symmetry of addition augend is rarely used and both terms are generally called addends </s>
<s> all of this terminology derives from latin </s>
<s> addition and add are english words derived from the latin verb addere which is in turn a compound of ad to and dare to give from the proto-indo-european root to give thus to add is to give to </s>
<s> using the gerundive suffix nd results in addend thing to be added </s>
<s> likewise from augere to increase one gets augend thing to be increased </s>
<s> sum and summand derive from the latin noun summa the highest the top and associated verb summare </s>
<s> this is appropriate not only because the sum of two positive numbers is greater than either but because it was once common to add upward contrary to the modern practice of adding downward so that a sum was literally higher than the addends </s>
<s> addere and summare date back at least to boethius if not to earlier roman writers such as vitruvius and frontinus boethius also used several other terms for the addition operation </s>
<s> the later middle english terms adden and adding were popularized by chaucer </s>
<s> addition is used to model countless physical processes </s>
<s> even for the simple case of adding natural numbers there are many possible interpretations and even more visual representations </s>
<s> this interpretation is easy to visualize with little danger of ambiguity </s>
