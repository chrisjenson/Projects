Christmas catastrophe . . .	That old rivalry between Macy's and Gimbel's rages on ! Allegedly a Christmas fantasy with comic and romantic trimmings , this TV-made remake of the 1947 holiday perennial turns sour mighty quickly , probing into the psychological ramifications of a department store Santa Claus who believes he is , in fact , Kris Kringle . Sebastian Cabot would appear to be a great choice to replace Edmund Gwenn in the leading role , but director Fielder Cook never allows Cabot a magical moment , keeping the camera at a distance from him - - and worse , keeping Kris in a perpetually combative mood . The romance initiated between hard-working single mom Jane Alexander and attorney David Hartman by Alexander's brainy daughter doesn't work , either ; young Suzanne Davidson , playing a walking encyclopedia , is full of forced cuteness and unnatural sparkle . When Davidson spies Santa Cabot speaking Spanish to a little girl , she reacts as if she's seen a miracle , dropping her mouth open mechanically . In updating Valentine Davies ' original story , I guess having Santa speak any other foreign language but Spanish was considered too outlandish . Yet , that's precisely the problem with this woebegone version : it hasn't an ounce of genuine wonderment or Christmas spirit .
An impossible concoction . . .	Absurd adaptation of a dinner-theater perennial by Alec Coppel has television-writer Glenn Ford attempting to cover up a murder by burying the corpse underneath wife Debbie Reynolds ' garden gazebo . This type of sitcom nonsense - - featuring totally unreal supporting characters bursting into the scenario at just the wrong moment ( such as the pushy real-estate agent ) - - doesn't usually work on film ; the would-be eccentricities stick out as phony artifices . Comedy shows from television have since put a stamp on this kind of bungling silliness . . . but was over-the-top , frazzled-nerves slapstick ever fresh ? Ford and Reynolds are actually a good screen match , but not when paired with this leaden script . Awkward , talky , and mercilessly unfunny . from
. . . and you thought Ally Sheedy was having a tough time !	Real-life teen sensation Molly Ringwald's fall from cinematic grace was swifter and more disastrous than Sky Lab , due in part to B-flicks like this one . It's a " Fatal Attraction " retread which casts the now-sexed up Ringwald as a jilted woman who stalks her man down , with John Vernon in a ridiculous supporting role as a detective who gets involved ( he snoops around like Hercule Poirot ) . Actually , the film begins OK , but gets increasingly more preposterous as things progress . Unreleased dud went straight to tape , with the little hoopla it received being Ringwald's scant nudity . Another Hollywood fairy-tale in reverse . from
The Disney people in desperation mode . . .	Although it was a hit with kids , this sequel to 1968's " The Love Bug " flounders around for some sort of inspiration , finding it only in the multiple flashbacks to the first picture . There's hardly a whiff of a plot , Helen Hayes looks uncomfortable , and Ken Berry is a poor man's Dean Jones . Worse , the special effects are shoddy , the production values cheap , and the slapstick laughs overdrawn by a director who practically prods you in the ribs . The Disney Company really lost more than their boss when Walt died ; they lost their direction , most especially in their live-action entertainment , relying on sequels and ( even today ) pointless remakes that show a complete misunderstanding of what their founder was trying to do . " Herbie " is surely at that barrel's bottom .
Queasy drama with a somewhat subversive premise . . .	Hapless 33-year-old gay man with only a few friends volunteers to take a new drug which promises to make him heterosexual . The trouble with this premise is , the central character ( inhibited and wounded ) would be unhappy in any sexual environment , either with a woman or another man . Writer-director John Baumgartner doesn't seem to take this into consideration , and so puts our hero into uncomfortable scenes such as the one where he gets intimate with a female co-worker ( who is seen as desperate and deluded ) . Low-budget and self-conscious , the picture doesn't even have the energy to hint at any intriguing ideas other than straight-vs . - gay . Baumgartner sees the casual indifference of the bar crowds and gives us a glimpse of the man's office job and his lonely life , but the main issue ( " What would life be like if I were straight ? " ) is too facile and obvious as a story-hook . Why not make the guy a bigot who is forced to take a gay pill ? The point made here is strictly a dead-end one , made even worse by one-dimensional people who don't merit much interest . from
A complete mess . . . although a few good laughs do emerge from the morass	When you think of " wacky , zany " comedies , the names of director J . Lee Thompson and screenwriter William Peter Blatty probably don't immediately come to mind . " John Goldfarb " is a with-it satire of politics , fads , football , feminism , and other topical issues which audiences of 1965 preferred to be without . Richard Crenna plays a piloting spy ( nicknamed " Wrong Way Goldfarb " ) who thinks he's bailed out over the U . S . S . R . ; instead , it's an Arab country ruled by gadget-crazy nut Peter Ustinov . Meanwhile , magazine writer Shirley MacLaine ( who also warbles the title song ! ) has infiltrated Ustinov's harem , apparently trying to get the scoop of the century ( but on what , I couldn't figure out ) . Too many targets and sight-gags render the loosely-hinged plot irrelevant , however some of MacLaine's shrieks are good for a laugh ( and she looks cute in a hot-pink two-piece ) . What were these talented filmmakers thinking when they hatched this rotten egg ? It's just a brightly-painted doodle , but even screwball nonsense should have at least one sane person to steer the ship . The cast here is kept running back and forth , waving their arms and yelling insults , while director Thompson must've been chortling in his sleep . from
How come nobody called the cops on the bully with the bat ?	Infuriating story from a Stephen King book about elderly man with ESP ( Anthony Hopkins , in an easy , sly performance ) befriending young Bobby ( Anton Yelchin ) , the boy of a single mother who both live downstairs in the same building . William Goldman's mediocre screenplay pokes around , trying to come up with interesting details , but the whole thing is too belabored , with arty directorial flourishes adding nothing ( such as the slow-motion photography with Bobby and his friends playing in the river ) . The focus of the piece is so off that a bullying kid is not only revealed to be a cross-dresser ( huh ? ? ) , he gets away from criminal punishment with a good , stiff beating from vengeful Bobby , while good-hearted Hopkins gets hauled away ( again , huh ? ? ) . The picture doesn't even have the sense to tie its ends together at the finish-line , instead giving us a voice-over dripping with dulled-out sentimentality . from
Positively embalmed	F . Scott Fitzgerald's celebrated novel about king of Long Island high society in the 1920s ( and his rocky relationship with a married beauty ) comes to the screen in the 1970s via the hand of Francis Ford Coppola ( as writer ) and star-leads Robert Redford and Mia Farrow . So why is it so bloody awful ? Could be the mismatched , miscast actors : Redford might be a plausible Gatsby if he were focused and in-character , but his monotone voice has no music and his immobile face reveals nothing ; as his Daisy , Farrow has some catty lines and works her little-girl smile and big eyes to some effect , but she looks like a child playing dress-up and has no chemistry whatsoever with Redford . Production is appropriately opulent , the jazz age is captured vividly , but the direction is deadly slow and the wordy script is a bummer , veering dangerously on the edge of soap opera ( surely not Fitzgerald's intent ) . A hazy snooze . Perhaps this book is singularly unfilmmable ? from
Offbeat , to be certain , but just not funny . . .	Director Rob Reiner in eccentric spirits , but not quite getting the offbeat laughs and sentimental subtext he was going for . Extremely unfunny fantasy concerns unappreciated youngster who receives emancipation from his parents under the proviso he find a new set of guardians within 2 months . Celebrity-studded misfire is slick but not clever , with Bruce Willis in nearly a career-killing role as an angelic " guide " ( he's also the film's narrator , in what plays like a last minute decision to fill in all the gaps ) . One or two fanciful scenes , but it needed more humor , less gooey uplift , and most especially an ending that didn't turn the picture into a pointless dodge . from
Impossible material doesn't play on the screen . . .	Curious , but completely shallow comedy-drama , adapted from Rachel Crothers ' play and directed by George Cuckor no less . Joan Crawford stars in the practically-unplayable role of Susan , a wealthy , silly socialite who gets religion . Susan tries turning her nitwit friends onto God , making her an outcast with the country club set . Subject matter , though odd and interesting for Hollywood in 1940 , somehow manages to get all fouled up in this screen-translation , with hopeless writing and characters . Promising supporting cast , including Frederic March , Rita Hayworth , Gloria DeHaven and Marjorie Main , can't do much to pick up the slack . from
Fruity title , wonderful presentation , but sadly , a stiff . . .	A shapely intergalactic princess ( complete with fancy head-dress ) and her spaceship co-horts land on Earth to kidnap nubile women for " breeding purposes " ; in a sub-story , a man-made astronaut who was designed to defeat the aliens has been damaged and is now a psychotic killing machine on the loose ! Wild low-budgeter from director Robert Gaffney , who blends an overly-ritzy sci-fi script with the monster-movie genre , succeeding in making a grade-Z movie which looks good yet still remains a bottom-dweller for drive-ins . Gaffney juices his scenario with rock & roll interludes , artistically-shot stock footage , and a caged beast who claws at the kidnapped girls . This flick actually has some cinematic ambitions - - if only Gaffney had picked up the pace a bit . As one of the chief creators of the robot , likable , low-keyed Jim Karen seems rather bemused ; he needn't be embarrassed , for this is a perfect example of professionally-assembled schlock , made with the best of intentions . Plus , those Vespas look fantastic ! from
Unconventional , perhaps . . . but still rigidly part of an unconventional formula	Craig Lucas adapted his own hit play about a nervous newlywed ( Meg Ryan ) inadvertently exchanging souls just after the wedding ceremony with a lonely , elderly man via a magical smooch . Lucas works hard trying to keep his script free from the often-tread " body switching movie " genre , but he has nothing else to fall back on . Bridegroom Alec Baldwin ( who also played this part on stage ) fidgets about trying to do something other than look confused , and Meg Ryan ( after the switch ) is stuck doing even less . The old-fashioned handling by director Norman René is too-cute - - and though Baldwin and Ryan are a nice screen match , this premise never allows that union to become important to us . from
No sting in forgettable Farrah vehicle . . .	This TV film , about an attorney trying to nab a crooked kingpin by purchasing a House of Ill Repute , was appropriately ignored upon its debut and today is hardly recalled . It must have dampened Farrah Fawcett's spirit to slip this dumb thing in between her off-Broadway show " Extremities " and the landmark TV drama " The Burning Bed " . She was trying so hard at this point to change Hollywood's flossy image of her that anticipating reactions to " The Burning Bed " must have been nerve-wracking . " The Red-Light Sting " gets off to a wan start , but does improve by the third act . Still , it's just cop-drama nonsense , offering nothing new or exciting , while all of Fawcett's best work lay just ahead of her . Good supporting cast includes Beau Bridges , Sunny Johnson in her final film appearance , Paul Burke from " Valley of the Dolls " , and Alex Henteloff who memorably co-starred with Fawcett years earlier in the " Night of the Strangler " episode of " Charlie's Angels " .
An aural delight . . . but as a film , not very stimulating	Modern updating of the Greek legend " Orpheus and Eurydice " set in Rio during Carnival . Local man meets a naive young woman from the country and they fall in love , but theirs is a doomed affair : he's set to marry a man-hungry spitfire and she's being stalked by a mysterious admirer in costume . French-Brazilian co-production was an international hit and won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film , so it's rather a pity it isn't better . There's wonderful music by Luiz Bonfá and Antonio Carlos Jobim , local ambiance and romance , but the story is awfully creaky by now , and the direction is flat and inexpressive . The color cinematography gives the film a tasty allure , but this verbose plot is ready-built for tragedy , and ultimately all we are left with is the locale and the pretty samba music . from
Obnoxious comedy . . .	A misfire from the writing team of Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel , an unfunny satire of reality television shows concerning a video store clerk picked by a lagging cable network to be the star of their new series . Matthew McConaughey gets followed around with cameras twenty-four hours a day , straining family relations and making dates with sexpots extremely difficult . Remake of the Canadian film " Louis XIX " has something to offend everybody , and though the actors are well-cast ( McConaughey and Woody Harrelson , in particular ) , precious few of these slapstick jokes work . Directed by Ron Howard , in a smug , self-satisfied fashion . from
Situation peculiar . . . but not hopeless	Two American soldiers stationed in Germany during World War II are captured by an odd German shopkeeper ( Alec Guinness ) ; he imprisons the two men in his basement and keeps them there long after the war is over . Strange , unhappy , insecure comedy-drama is extremely well-cast but is really too creepy to laugh at . As the soldiers , Michael Connors and Robert Redford have some good moments , but one can't help but feeling this is just an actors ' exercise for both ( they're green , but commendable ) . Alec Guinness is forced to walk a fine line in his characterization ; it's imperative to the story that we don't hate the shopkeeper , and Guinness works hard at finding nuances in the man to keep him complex and interesting . If newcomers Connors and Redford are young actors just finding their way , then Guinness is in the Master's class . from
Reynolds fits like a glove in a tale of the sweaty South . . .	Burt Reynolds plays Gator McKlusky , a likable ex-convict just released from prison who helps the feds nab a corrupt small town sheriff . Laid-back Reynolds was often accused by critics of merely phoning these ' good ol ' boy ' performances in ; true , he's on auto-pilot throughout . But in his day , Reynolds knew just how to make a low-key effort work well for himself . Ingratiating and handsome , Reynolds comes as close to winking at the audience as he can without breaking up ; he seems to know these backwoods as well as any movie star , while director Joesph Sargent provides an easy pace and a sweaty ambiance which brings the South alive . Unfortunately , the story isn't much , and supporting actors Ned Beatty and Bo Hopkins overact ( as usual ) . Diane Ladd is fine in a small part , and real-life daughter Laura Dern can be glimpsed in the background . Reynolds returned to this character for 1976's " Gator " . from
" You're a dinosaur , Callahan , your ideas don't work any more ! "	Clint Eastwood produced , directed and stars in this " Dirty Harry " entry ( the fourth in the series ) which might have been enjoyably cheesy were it not for the accent on rape , the threat of rape , degradation and humiliation . It's a sadomasochistic police-thriller which pits cop Harry Callahan against a vigilante with an agenda ; turns out , it's wispy Sondra Locke who is eliminating a circle of drooling , sneering perverts one by one after what they did to her and her sister . Opening with some great shots of San Francisco , and an intriguing set-up to the plot with a murder on Lover's Lane , Eastwood quickly reverts back to stale formula , with a by-the-books dressing down of our hero . Still , Callahan's career woes are highly favorable to what follows , a meandering series of grueling flashbacks to the night Locke was assaulted ( were Clint and his editor too hypnotized to cut away ? ) . The movie is pure balderdash : rude , crude , ugly beyond words , and not even satisfying on its own terms , as a revenge fantasy . from
A 1968 vanity project for the Stones , who get upstaged by the Who . . .	Long-shelved concert film was originally intended for British television in 1968 , but the Rolling Stones were unhappy their musical sequence was not as dynamic as that of the Who . The project languished in obscurity until it was found and received a theatrical release Stateside in 1996 . It's a raucous , shapeless extravaganza , a perfect example of content without form , providing some great music , a decadently cavalier atmosphere ( which is intriguing ) , but no food for thought . This is the only known appearance of the Dirty Mac ( who perform John Lennon's " Yer Blues " ) , but everyone gets upstaged by the Who , who really whip up a frenzy . As for the Stones : they clearly felt no threat another rock group was out to steal their limelight ; they are indeed exciting , but even more endearing is the old-fashioned , fire-eating circus stuff which doesn't quite jell with the music on hand but is amusingly presented nonetheless . from
Hardly a satisfying moment in the entire film . . . insulting and poorly-made , as well	City girl Meg Tilly receives a horrifying phone call from her mother and , understandably shaken , returns home to her family's rural digs , only to be faced with a mystery : why are all the homespun residents acting out in bizarre and unsettling ways ? Radiation thriller , with barely a nod to ecology , has small town residents going berserk , which ( laughably ) includes two women gazing at each other with desire in a public place and Tim Matheson receiving oral attention from a girl on an office bench . The picture is too silly for words , wasting Tilly's talents while forcing itself into a corner it can't possibly hope to get out of ( and predictably , the finale lands with a clatter ) . Some of the cinematography by Thomas Del Ruth is good ( particularly a fire sequence set inside a garage ) and the scenario had promise . Unfortunately , the draggy direction and simplistic screenplay have neither surprises nor originality up their sleeves . from
Ragged road comedy / drama , noteworthy for Shields	Brooke Shields in a slightly awkward phase ( she never did go through the braces-and-glasses thing , but she's a skinny smartass here and for her that's awkward enough ) . Her pinball wizardry catches the eye of a con-man and together they take on all-comers . Critics at the time singled out Charles Durning's performance as if he were the Second Coming ; truth is , his role as the all-time pinball champion hits the picture a little too late in the game . It has already exhausted us with its low-rent production and aimless plot line . I did think Brooke showed some spunk here , but she's no Kristy McNichol ( who might have elevated this to a somewhat substantial level , or at least given it some different shadings ) . As it is , " Tilt " is a dim bulb . from
It melts on impact . . .	The " Beach Party " series taking one of its last gasps : Frankie Avalon and sniggering Dwayne Hickman hit the ski slopes and get stuck doing Tony Curtis & Jack Lemmon routines from " Some Like It Hot " , and the comparison isn't favorable . Avalon is actually game , but Hickman has no screen presence and the comic hijinks are mostly juvenile . The script isn't as clever as the ones for the " Beach " flicks , and everyone just seems piqued . Avalon's main squeeze is no longer Annette Funicello , who has an unbilled cameo as a college professor ( her two brief scenes are beauties ) . James Brown and Lesley Gore are both terrific in musical support , Deborah Walley and Yvonne Craig are pretty ski-bunnies , but this fractured gang is obviously a lackluster substitute . A . I . P . continued the following year not with " Cruise Party " - - as advertised - - but " Ghost In The Invisible Bikini " . from
Tiresome meditation	Reclusive director Terence Malick's first film in YEARS is a heavy-going vision of hellish war ( I resist using the term " epic " since Malick's interpretation of mortal combat is frequently rather puny ; he's better at quiet moments of contemplation than dealing with actors in volatile situations ) . Malick seems just about the worst director you could get to film a war movie , but his heart was in the right place I suppose , and - - as it turned out - - much of Hollywood's male A-list was anxious to work with him ( more people must have seen " Days of Heaven " than we thought ! ) . This visit to Guadacanal during WWII is indeed hellish for a group of young soldiers , but their personalities don't really take shape - - nor are they particularly likable or interesting ( and it's tough to tell from Malick's usual soft-sell if this was intentional ) . Soldier Woody Harrelson , just after much of his torso is destroyed by a grenade , complains of never being able to fk again . This tips us off that Malick is contemplative of war as a macho , heterosexual experience , and the bitterness of this scene lingers longer than any of Malick's other intentions . Solemn film is full of dreamy remembrances and intense close-ups of handsome Hollywood faces , but these cameos throw off the film's mood , turning it into an old-fashioned foray ( recalling " A Bridge Too Far " ) . Nick Nolte is simply tiresome as an officer on the verge of hysteria , though both Sean Penn and Elias Koteas come up with interesting characterizations . Otherwise , it's a mess . from
Tentative and tepid . . .	Jean Simmons as a mentally fragile woman returning home to her dysfunctional family after a stay in an institution . Simmons , a very samey actress , played a lot of these troubled types , women with see-sawing emotions ( and the other characters ' reactions to her are always the same in every circumstance : shock or surprise at her indignation at being treated like a patient , and using her bursts of coherent anger against her as proof that she's still not right in the head ) . The picture , beautifully filmed in black-and-white on atmospheric New England locations , is unfortunately stuck on some kind of dreary merry-go-round , with Simmons seeing the insanity around her but unable to pinpoint it to others . When you have only one character on-screen pulling for herself , struggling against a tide of absurdities , the results can be frustrating . Director Mervyn LeRoy is sensitive to the heroine , and writers Eileen and Robert Bassing are exceptionally careful with this provocative milieu ( and , to their credit , the film isn't dated from a medical standpoint ) , but the movie hasn't much to say about mental incapacitation ; its goal ultimately is to be a tough soaper for female audiences ( with Efrem Zimbalist , Jr . as a possible Prince ) . from
Thoroughly lackluster mystery-thriller . . .	Jonathan Demme is such a character-oriented director that , to see him pulling a Brian De Palma ( which is to say , aping Hitchcock ) , it is nearly predictable when he fails to work up much suspense within this tepid mystery . Working from a screenplay by David Shaber , from Murray Teigh Bloom's novel , Demme attempts to strike a chord somewhere between Alan J . Pakula's paranoia dramas and Hitchcock's dangling-participle thrillers . Roy Scheider stars as a retired Secret Agent mourning the murder of his wife who is now busy dodging bad guys who are out to kill him . Takes off right away , but the script is full of flimsy threads and any excitement dies out quickly . There's a visually impressive climax at Niagra Falls , but Demme gets little out of his cast , and even less out of this bummer of a story . from
Doris Day is ' S Wonderful . . . not so the rest of " Starlift "	Actress Ruth Roman's real-life philanthropic gesture to help entertain troops arriving from and leaving for the Korean War at an air base near San Francisco jump-started this all-star Warner Bros . salute to patriotism and song . Many celebrities make guest appearances while a love-hate romance develops between a budding starlet and a painfully green and skinny Air Force Corporal ( Ron Hagerthy , who looks like he should be delivering newspapers from his bicycle ) . Seems the Corporal has fooled the actress into thinking he's off to battle when actually he's part of a airplane carrier crew , flying to and from Honolulu ( you'd think she'd be happy he was staying out of harm's way , but instead she acts just like most childish females in 1950s movies ) . Doris Day is around for the first thirty minutes or so , and her distinct laugh and plucky song numbers are most pleasant . Roman is also here , looking glamorous , while James Cagney pokes fun at his screen persona and Gordon MacRae sings in his handsome baritone . Jane Wyman sings , too , in a hospital bedside reprise following Doris Day's lead , causing one to wonder , " Did they run out of sets ? " For undemanding viewers , an interesting flashback to another time and place . Still , the low-rent production and just-adequate technical aspects render " Starlift " strictly a second-biller . from
Folksy tale has since been improved-upon , but this cast is very fine . . .	Thornton Wilder's play about a matchmaking busy-body named Dolly Levi in 1880s Yonkers , New York who has been hired to find a mate for a wealthy , grumpy business owner ; she comically attempts to keep him for herself , while the gal he admires is quickly falling for one of his own employees . The later stage ( and film ) musical " Hello , Dolly ! " actually improved upon this scenario - - there are pauses here which practically call out for a song - - but there's evident charm in Shirley Booth's lead portrayal ; at times addressing the audience directly ( with many of the players following suit ) , Booth sounds a lot like Thelma Ritter ( and has some of Ritter's spunk ) , but she doesn't get her share of the good lines . Scenes of Dolly getting a wedding ring stuck on her finger or delightedly finding men hiding in Shirley MacLaine's hat shop don't really come off . Booth is friendly but frivolous , and we never quite become involved in her quest to have a man - - this man - - in her life ( in the film-version of " Hello , Dolly ! " , Barbra Streisand was much more persuasive about her need to share her life with a mate - - even if it was Walter Matthau ! ) . The film flutters about in a jolly , folksy way , but some of its gags ( such as Anthony Perkins and Robert Morse having to dress in drag ) are just silly . It begins and finishes on an upbeat note , but the leaden handling drags its midsection down , even though the cast is quite good . from
Dim-bulb film-making . . .	Joel Schumacher is perfectly capable of making a slambang thriller , even if his courses of action don't always jibe with audience expectations , however his more serious efforts can be completely off the mark . Here , his intention to make a gritty , no-holds-barred film about the porno underworld is laced with tedious TV crime-drama set-ups and clichés aplenty ! Andrew Kevin Walker's screenplay should bear at least half the blame , but the sinking feeling one gets from " 8MM " relates largely to way it looks and plays out . Nicolas Cage is wasted in role as investigator trying to determine if a bloody snuff flick is real , and , if not , what happened to the young female victim involved . Intentionally seamy , but unintentionally stupid . Worth-watching if only for a terrific supporting performance by Joaquin Phoenix as a clerk , but poor Catherine Keener has an insulting role as Cage's wife . from
Offensively trite . . .	Old-fashioned coming-of-age clichés and young romance packaged in new-fangled wrapping . Ben Stiller made his directorial debut with this would-be irreverent look at Generation X-ers making a go at life after graduating from college , exposing his soft penchant for normalcy in the second-half and slushing the movie with sentimental humor . Winona Ryder is a very ingratiating actress , and convincing as an unconventional girl unsure of which road to take - - but a slacker she is not ; when the film shows her as floundering , or getting by using her ' cute ' wiles , it lapses into cartoony territory . There's not much reality in " Reality Bites " , except that shallow is as shallow does . Pretty desperate and drippy . from
Outlandish conspiracy thriller ; does anything good ever happen in Washington , D . C . ?	Georgetown attorney Will Smith gets help from conspiracy-expert Gene Hackman after a videotape has been passed to him showing a Washington , D . C . Congressman being ambushed and killed by the Director of Security and his goons . Highly ridiculous Tony Scott-directed thriller with laughably bad dialogue and secondary characters . The overripe screenplay also manages to work in the requisite formula car chases , lots of resident break-ins ( with countless close-ups of locks being picked ) , a sub-plot about Mafiosos , and another story thread about an F . B . I . investigative team who rank as the most incompetent dummies ever seen in a political suspenser . Smith - - sticking his jaw out like an offended child - - isn't really right for this part , though personally that is to his advantage ; whether chasing after a cat or feeding Hackman pretzels after Gene's hand is nearly shot off , this character ( as written ) is tiresome and foolish . It's nice to see acting veterans Hackman and Jon Voight square off , but the picture is so flabby and brainless it defeats them and everyone else . from
A commercial comeback for Altman , but it's overloaded with stars . . .	Director Robert Altman practically resurrected his quirky film-making career with this in-jokey , acerbic overview of show business , and the many celebrities who dot the cast prove that Altman's prestigious name and reputation made much of Hollywood want to jump on-board . Still , this murder mystery , with studio hotshot Tim Robbins involved in the death of a would-be screenwriter , is wayward and smug , and the star-cameos are like speedbumps in the course of the story . Robbins is carefully handled and efficient , but disappointingly one-note ; Whoopi Goldberg is terribly out of place as an investigator on the case ( she looks like yet another star-sighting until you realize she's " in character " ) . Brightly-made , fairly lively picture is fine as a time-filler , but it isn't engrossing as a crime flick should be . Altman is more interested in having a good time than in trying to top himself . from
Gloomy hocus-pocus . . .	William Goldman adapted his own novel , a melodrama about an unstable ventriloquist comedian - - not exactly a winning match-up . Anthony Hopkins gives an agonizing actors ' performance playing a magician / ventriloquist who revels in a sort of naughty burlesque style ; however , at this stage in his career , Hopkins seemingly had no good humor in him ( nasty or otherwise ) , nor did glum director Richard Attenborough , who has seen too many movies and replicates old suspense . This isn't " Dead Of Night " , this is more like " Night Gallery " ( and one of the weaker episodes ! ) . " Magic " pulls nothing new from its hat , although Ann-Margret plays a former crush very sweetly - - she's a welcome relief to all the perspiring and twitching Hopkins heaps upon us - - and Burgess Meredith does his wily old coot bit to perfection . The dummy , Fats , is made to look like a Hopkins caricature ; he's kind of freaky , yet his intrusive manner is decidedly off-putting . This is a gimmick movie without much of a gimmick , just a bunch of timeworn ideas . The curiously low-keyed finale is surprisingly thoughtful , but much of " Magic " is dreary , and helmed with too heavy a hand . from
Bumping and grinding to a halt . . .	Ann-Margret alternates between come-hither pussycat and uptight do-gooder playing a would-be writer who attempts to pass herself off as sexually depraved in order to get a deal with a sleazy men's magazine . The problem with this picture is the very same predicament Annie faces : it's a square piece of goods palming itself off as naughty . The opening montage of sex-clubs is amusing , and A-M is energetic bouncing around on a trampoline , but the movie is talky , draggy , and seemingly produced on the cheap . Tony Franciosa doesn't work very well with Ann-Margret ( he squirms too much , which isn't good for the romantic sub-plot ) . A few clever gimmicks - - like the teaser ending , which caught me off guard - - and Ann-Margret's shapely figure compensate , but " The Swinger " just doesn't swing . Perhaps a director with a sharper flair for visual slapstick and satire ( like Frank Tashlin ) may have brought out a more cartoony sensibility to these proceedings . George Sidney certainly tries , but he's too literal for the flighty material ; while staging a mock-orgy , he has Ann-Margret writhing around on the floor slathered in paint . . . wouldn't straight sex be cleaner ? from
It curdles from cuteness . . .	Danny Thomas plays real-life hit songwriter Gus Kahn , responsible in the 1900s for such innocent , old-fashioned tunes as " I Wish I Had a Girl " , " Toot , Toot , Tootsie ( Goodbye ) " and " It Had To Be You " . Doris Day plays Kahn's songbird spouse and Mary Wickes is their wiseacre maid - - and both are much preferable to Thomas , who gives an extremely weak performance . Hokey , safe " contract " picture from Warner Bros . keeps the stars busy and is fine during the musical stretches , but as a drama it falls short . Supporting characters are introduced and then dropped in rapid succession , and incidents such as Kahn's heart attack are glossed over with syrupy uplift . Day is pleasant as always , but she doesn't quite click with Thomas , who reads his lines with canned enthusiasm . from
A barrage of artistic overtures and general indulgence . . .	Director Martin Scorsese kicked around the indie circuit and second-unit work out in Hollywood before breaking through as a director with this melodrama set in New York's " Little Italy " district . Harvey Keitel plays a struggling Catholic trying to keep clean , and the character is most likely a highly personal one based on Scorsese in his early days ( or someone very close to him ) . Intelligently-made film about desperate characters living on the edge isn't especially profound , though it is intrinsically exciting in a show-offy way . Scorsese , who also penned the screenplay with Mardik Martin from Scorsese ' original treatment , proves to have an uncanny knack for kick-starting a scene using pop and rock music to its best advantage , and , in his now-characteristic way , he intermingles all his violent , tough-talking characters with the stunning assurance of a technical veteran . Keitel's performance is adept and multi-shaded , though Robert De Niro doesn't quite make that initial strong impression . from
Despite stunning Lucy , a dire comedy . . .	Red Skelton plays a smitten working-stiff who finally makes out financially ; he proposes marriage to the fortune-hunting singer whom he loves , who then becomes Madame Du Barry in his dreams . A chance - - though not a very good one - - for Lucille Ball to show off her comedic chops , however Skelton isn't given anything bright or funny to do , and Gene Kelly gets stuck in a second-banana bit . Attractive but dim musical-comedy which originated on Broadway ; the Cole Porter songs from the play were largely scrapped here , although the " Friendship " number survived and it's the most energetic moment in the film . In this instance , Kelly gets to mug playfully and Lucy sings in her appealingly scratchy voice , yet once again Skelton is left outside the fun . from
A well-acted failure . . .	Graham Greene's novel becomes somewhat undernourished wartime melodrama , without the scope , vision or substantial budget to credibly expound on its themes . Michael York plays a young ne'er-do-well who comes to stay with his sister and her wealthy fiancé / benefactor in 1930s Germany , just before the rise of the Nazi party . An incredible period in time for storytelling , yet the human drama here fails to ignite . It's interesting but cold , without much emotion or point . Filmed in Yugoslavia ( ! ) , the movie does have a handsome look , though it surely would have benefited from a larger budget or authentic locales in order to truly capture the fervor and frenzy of Hitler-era Germany ( as " Cabaret " had accomplished just one year before , curiously also starring Michael York ) . It's a fake , but not a bad one , a picture that does not strive ( thankfully ) to recreate Concentration Camp hysteria but instead provide more insight into the interpersonal complexities of this time . York is reunited with his " Lost Horizon " co-star Peter Finch , and both actors are fine if generally unmemorable . from
More peculiar than entertaining . . .	Curious head-scratcher of a western directed by George Marshall features James Craig as a drifter in 1868 Tucson who disrupts the wedding of feisty barmaid Lucille Ball , later stopping a war between the white man and an Apache Indian tribe ! Lucy-completists will want to take a look , but this may be one example of why her movie-career never caught fire . The picture is just a second-string quickie , despite writers Clarence Budington Kelland and Horace McCoy tossing in some comedic overtones ( which help ) . Unfortunately , it just doesn't add up to much . I'd trade all those tumbleweeds for a cameo by William Frawley . from
Too fluff-headed to be very memorable . . .	In 1963 Dallas , a Jackie Kennedy-obsessed beautician hopes to travel by bus to JFK's funeral , but gets involved instead with a troubled black man and his estranged little girl . Handsome production , nice details , but a curiously minor film that never quite kicks into gear . Occasionally , the way the racial prejudices are shown - - from both black and white characters - - is heavy-handed , though director Jonathan Kaplan does subtle work as well , performing a nimble balancing act while the screenplay works overtime being " heated " and " emotional " . Michelle Pfeiffer's performance is alternately grating , unconventional , sweet and perplexing ; we don't get to know her Lurene too well , and the actress has to rely on shtick for some of her major scenes ; Dennis Haysbert as her traveling companion is a tower of quiet strength , and his handsome , aw-shucks smile isn't over-used . The plot is wrapped up neatly at the end , a tricky feat since the finale takes place some 12 months from the rest of the story - - a gimmick that doesn't always work , but here it satisfies the viewer by showing lives changed and what might lay ahead . Potentially a heady mix of race-relations and something even deeper ( and no-less complicated ) : forbidden love . Yet the picture somehow whittles down these complicated issues into a road-movie formula . from
Prolonged , textbook kidnap-plot with interesting milieu . . .	Director Rudolph Maté's " Union Station " , from Thomas Walsh's novel , pairs William Holden again with Nancy Olson just after their triumphs in " Sunset Blvd . " While both stars are solid here , the step-down to genre shtick ( particularly for Holden ) is disheartening . After seeing what Holden was truly capable of , he's reduced here to the old cops-and-kidnappers formula , with barely a personality beneath his badge . Olson plays a worrisome secretary who spots some desperate-looking men on her train ; after reporting them to the authorities , it's discovered - - in an outrageous coincidence - - the men have just kidnapped the blind daughter of Olson's wealthy employer . Aside from some uncommon brutalities , and a sadistically funny game of good cop-bad cop between detective Holden , chief inspector Barry Fitzgerald and one of the crooks , this paste-up case is pretty cut and dry . The train station surroundings are fun , but the victim ( a real screamer ) is a sad sack , as are the dopey villains . Olson has little to do but wring her hands , but she certainly comes out better than Jan Sterling , playing sweetheart to the bad guys . Sterling , after being forced to roll about in the gutter , later gets one of those Hollywood hospital scenes which doesn't even show her off to any great advantage . The picture is smoothly steady , but rather a no-brainer . from
Smart , funny dialogue and songs . . . but the casting works against the plot	Remake of 1943's " Coney Island " ( both starring Betty Grable ! ) has Victor Mature ( in suits and straw hats ) playing a hustler-showman conning old acquaintance Phil Harris into going in business together in 1890s Chicago . Seems nightclub owner Harris has scuffled with a rowdy drunk and believes he's killed him ; Mature holds this over his head and steals his girl in the process ! Screenwriter Charles Lederer has penned a great deal of smart , sassy patter ( broken up every now and again by cute musical numbers ) , but he fumbles what little plot there is . Lederer also isn't helped by the casting : Phil Harris seems like such a genuinely nice guy ( with a big , gregarious smile ) that Mature comes off a bit cold-hearted by contrast ( he's not the dashing romantic intended ) . Grable is very lively on stage and funny in a catfight scene with a showgirl ; she keeps a heated temper throughout and gives the movie a good goosing . Also funny is Margaret Hamilton in small role as a crusader for decency ( no one displays comic indignation better than Hamilton ) . Fox production values a bit low , although the trick photography during a ferris wheel sequence is well done and Harris has a funny bit there inadvertently proposing to a sailor . from
Southern-fried " Peyton Place "	When a Texas prisoner escapes from his work farm and is reported to be heading home , the patrons of his rural community react in various , hot-blooded ways . Malarkey of the first order , nearly saved by Marlon Brando's tightly-controlled performance as the town's fair sheriff ; Angie Dickinson's work as his wife is also first-rate . Robert Redford ( as the escapee , improbably nick-named Bubber ) and Jane Fonda ( as a social disgrace who has feelings for the convict ) are both fair , but the script is talky , hokey , and overflowing with unconvincing soap opera . The rather staid climax in an auto junkyard isn't exactly the stuff of intense , high drama - - but at least there's some action going on there . All the behind-the-scenes in-fighting is now the stuff of Hollywood folklore . from
Story-wise , it's a mess . . .	Muddled adaptation of Pat Conroy's book ( briefly retitled " The Ace " at one point ) features Robert Duvall as strict Marine Bull Meechum , raising his kids with an iron fist in 1962 . Duvall is well cast but one-note in the lead ; didn't this guy have another side they could've explored ? Was he only about outbursts and confrontation ? The character is written as such a hot-headed buffoon that he elicits no sympathy . Film is fatally doomed by irrational racial sub-plot that gets shoehorned in , possibly to take us away from the father for a few minutes but , alas , not to a better place . Michael O'Keefe as the son has a nice , mellow way with an exchange , and it's always nice to see Blythe Danner's work - - and yet , she's wasted as the mom . from
" The great . . . ultimate ache . . . of desolation "	Paddy Chayefsky's monologue-heavy lambasting of the Sex Symbol mythology , with Kim Stanley as a troubled young woman from Maryland who comes to Los Angeles in the 1940s to work as an actress and becomes a star . Queasy , peculiar melodrama seems to blame show-business for the girl's plight , but we can clearly see from the beginning she's an extremely insecure person , able to attract people but not capable of keeping them . Stanley does everything she can with this role , but she looks much more mature than the men she's paired up with , and Chayefsky does her a disservice by having everyone talk about what a talent she is but never letting us see for ourselves . It's a busy , chatty movie that tries on different themes and then drops them ( just as it does most of the male characters ) . Patty Duke ( pre - " The Miracle Worker " ) has a nice bit near the beginning ( playing Stanley as a grade-schooler ) , the black-and-white cinematography is quite good and there are flashes of interest throughout . from
A friendly , often frisky TV-movie with some smart ideas . . .	Not-bad comedy-drama from a book by Susan Trott ( and co-produced for television by Ron Howard and Henry Winkler ) has recently-dumped Valerie Perrine trying to get on with her life , becoming involved with both a policeman ( Ed O'Neill ) and a kinky young lothario ( Merritt Butrick , who gets himself warmed up by sneaking into Perrine's window at night ) . Valerie's consistent exasperation over her situation is good for a few laughs , and her cynicism and sass are appealing qualities . The movie doesn't particularly look good , with muddy photography and cramped settings , but the central idea - - a modern woman facing unwanted independence - - should be relatable subject matter for many viewers , and that's pulled off quite nicely here . Perrine is very attractive ( as always ) and O'Neill , years before his hit TV show " Married With Children " , is handsome and charming as well .
Frisky performances help disguise the fact it is already clunky and outmoded . . .	Movies made for the here-and-now ( instead of for all-time ) date far worse than the average film , and movies dealing with modern-day technology are apt to look junk heap-worthy in just a few short years . The Tracy & Hepburn comedy " Desk Set " is one such example ( where a know-it-all computer was brought in to an information office , taking up half the room ) . The scenario of " WarGames " centers on a boy's home computer , decked out with dashboard graphics , a black background , and a blinking cursor . It also has a stubborn agenda of its own , but this no " 2001 " . There's a fresh angle to the screenplay : a goof-off high schooler ( Matthew Broderick ) manages to tap the Pentagon's computer system while playing a world-annihilation game from his bedroom , nearly causing World War III . He and his girlfriend ( Ally Sheedy ) have a devil-may-care relationship which makes the first-half of the picture breezy and appealing ( and his semi-clueless parents are fun , too ) . But eventually , they - - and we - - have to be taught a lesson about the evils inherent in the misuse of technology , and the film comes to a virtual stand-still as a professor soap-boxes to the audience about such depressing matters as the end of civilization as we know it . Barry Corbin's salty U . S . General puts that into more succinct , layman's terms when he says , " I'd pss on a sparkplug if I thought it'd do any good . " from
Dismissed by film connoisseurs . . . but acted with youthful conviction by McQueen	A meteor crashes to Earth in a small American town and its inner mass of a sticky , protozoa-like substance begins a slow but steady killing spree . Nothing really substantial here , but not a disgrace : " The Blob " is a fun , fast-paced B-flick made for teenagers circa 1958 . It features beautifully saturated colors and at least one stand-out amongst the cast . Attempting to rally the disbelieving town police and the city residents to his side , Steve McQueen is very effective in his youthful seriousness ; he later made jokes about the movie , but it's a solid performance . The picture has been directed with a sure , even hand , the script has some intentionally funny passages , and the cinematographer manages to get some great shots ( and one iconic image of a large crowd of people - - possibly too many people for this late in the evening - - fleeing a movie theater ) . Followed by a sequel in 1972 , and later remade with heavy doses of hysteria and gore , this " Blob " is a little light on nightmarish scares , but its white-bread innocence is both naive and simple - - and perhaps reassuring . from
Violence for the purpose of shocking . . .	Exceptionally bloody and profane drug-mob melodrama updates the 1930's Scarface / Al Capone legend and transplants it to 1980's Florida . Political Cuban refugee ( Al Pacino ) , liberated from his homeland by Castro in 1980 along with some 125 , 000 other refugees , becomes major drug-lord in Miami . Elaborately made and mounted paean to underworld crime revels in its sleaze : the sordid characters , the ultra-violent mayhem , and one particular four-letter-word . Pacino plays a Cuban drug czar like nobody else , but his barbed , swaggering performance - - while audacious - - is one-note and over-the-top . Oliver Stone wrote the muddled screenplay ( he's never sure which way to lean ) and Brian DePalma directed , rather oppressively . Paul Muni played Scarface in the 1932 version , trafficking in bootleg gin instead of cocaine . . . which version you prefer might depend on your tolerance for chainsaws . from
Underwhelming comedy-drama with A-list talent . . .	Sterling cast featuring not only Julia Roberts and Dennis Quaid , but also Robert Duvall , Gena Rowlands and Kyra Sedgwick , is a handsomely-made but rather ordinary , women's TV-type light drama ( with barbed language added ) . Roberts plays harried working mom down South who discovers husband Quaid has been unfaithful ; they fight , discuss divorce , fight some more , while Roberts gets advice from her well-to-do parents ( they ponder the situation when the answers should be obvious ) . Pleasant cast nearly masks the fact this is completely rote material ( with Sedgwick as Roberts ' p . o . ' ed sister who gets in the proverbial crotch kick ) . Pokey , overly-familiar , overlong film with too few laughs and too much inane banter . Photographed by the famous Sven Nykvist , who indeed gives the picture a rich , glossy look . from
Sin , corruption , and singing . . . a variable brouhaha	Clark Gable as a Barbary Coast nightclub owner in 1906 San Francisco who is considering going into politics ; he has recently hired former librarian Jeanette MacDonald as a singer ( despite her skinny legs ) and is quickly falling for her , although her operatic trilling has caught the ears of more influential men in the business . Romantic melodrama throws in Father Spencer Tracy for added depth ( he was Oscar-nominated ! ) , yet this transparent narrative is mighty flimsy from the get-go . With all the dames at Gable's disposal , it isn't convincing for a minute that he would be sleeping alone on New Year's Eve , or that his attraction to songbird Jeannette would cause him such consternation ( just what does he see in her ? MacDonald's entire scrubbed-clean style seems just the opposite of Gable's no-bull approach ) . Jeannette has a scene late in the picture with wise , white-haired Jessie Ralph , who shames the sinful city and its corrupt Golden Gates under her breath . Cue the earthquake ! The special effects at the finale are very good , and the flashy editing is interesting throughout ( creating trenchant subtext and a vigorous appeal for the film ) , but the characters simply don't wash and the performances are variable . Tracy cancels out the embarrassingly maudlin tone of his lines simply by being half-present ; Gable isn't so lucky - - and he has to listen to a whole lot of singing before he's through . from
A self-important rumination	Richard Gere is appropriately cocky , assured and well-manicured as Julian , a high-paid Beverly Hills escort for wealthy women , but while on assignment in Palm Springs he becomes associated with a low-life couple which leads to a murder - - with Julian as the fall-guy . Vicious pimps , politician's wives , and lots of nasty talk turns " American Gigolo " into a bitter , moralistic would-be expose . It's clear that writer-director Paul Schrader identifies with Julian's tangled ethics , and Schrader has always been attracted to the theme of morality under duress , but here these ingredients don't strengthen the movie - - he turns an intriguing scenario into a sex-laced dirge . from
Foster works admirably hard , but film is unenlightening and not too convincing . . .	Young woman , raised in total isolation in the backwoods of North Carolina by her mother ( who had suffered strokes and inadvertently taught her daughter an idiosyncratic form of English ) is discovered by a well-meaning doctor who hopes to understand her ; unfortunately , other doctors with an eye on their careers get involved and , figuring the girl to be a mentally retarded wild child , bring science into the equation . Intrinsically , the film is about how civilization corrupts our innate innocence , yet the movie is really a bit condescending to the medical profession to suggest today's scientists ( and journalists ) are only interested in basic assimilation and not the human spirit . If this is indicative of today's society - - and that the message is we'd all be better off living like Nell - - it doesn't provide much enlightenment ( or entertainment value ) , just annoyance . The picture has a cold , flat look , and Jodie Foster ( a highly intelligent actress ) rarely gets to use her brains ; she's beautifully pale and dreamy-eyed one minute , a ferocious animal the next , and the transitions are jarring . Natasha Richardson , as the doctor who would initially like to see Nell act like just like the rest of us , gets stuck with the worst role ( all she ever seems to ask is , " So what are we gonna do about Nell ? " ) . Many of the doctors are written and acted to be the villains of the piece ( right about on a par with the ignorant roadhouse yahoos who make fun of Nell ) , and the director ( the estimable Michael Apted ) can't seem to get around the daunting clichés . Foster provides a few lovely moments , especially when showing off her expressive hands in close-up , and there's a touching final shot of her knowing , gentle face , but the movie itself just goes around in circles . from
Script-writing in short-hand . . .	Two-brother piano act , growing stale through the years , gets big boost after acquiring sultry female singer , the torchy type who is unafraid to hop atop a piano to deliver a flirtatious number , and who eventually - - and inadvertently - - comes between the siblings while seeming to be unaware of her own allure . All the good acting in the world can't quite make these characters work . Michelle Pfeiffer's sugar-puss-songbird is a writer's creation ; wide-eyed and innocent at the emotional ruckus she causes , and yet street-smart enough to beguile us with her wise-ass nonchalance , she seldom makes logical or emotional sense . Jeff Bridges gets to moon over her like a drunken has-been in need of a haircut-and-shave , but poor Beau Bridges is given little to do ( in the kind of third-wheel role never envied by anybody ) . And when all is said and done , are we supposed to feel proud of the chanteuse who was compelled to do her own thing after getting her feet wet with this unremarkable duo ? She spreads her wings all right , but the character is all a cliché .
Downbeat ghost story , satisfying up to a point . . .	Newly-separated Jennifer Connelly moves herself and her child into an apartment building across the river from Manhattan , and immediately an ominous-looking water stain on the bedroom ceiling spells danger . Director Walter Salles , working from both the novel by Kôji Suzuki and the 2002 Japanese original from Hideo Nakata , doesn't go for " Ring " - styled bombast ; he's much more subtle and interested in the nuances of character , the underlining paranoia in the narrative , and in the very tense atmosphere . He has obviously studied Roman Polanski's tenement terrors and knows a great deal about creating suspense from mood and ambiance ( he allows the viewer to think the worst without ever getting so graphic ) . Unfortunately , the source material itself is what trips Salles up . Polanski would have eschewed most of the red herrings and the mystery plot about the little girl upstairs who got left behind ( a parallel to Connelly's unhappy childhood ) . This thread actually becomes the whole movie , leading to a curious , unhappy climax . Sadly , in today's market , you can't have a big-budget spooky movie be all about character and paranoia ; this is where the exploding faucets come in - - and where director Salle's style can only take the film so far before it becomes waterlogged . from
Occasionally powerful melodrama	Sean Penn wrote , co-produced and directed this strong drama about a conflicted Los Angeles businessman intent on nailing the drunk driver who killed his daughter . In the lead , Jack Nicholson is appropriately somber , displaying no over-the-top theatrics as he visits the parolee just sprung from jail , giving him three days of freedom before his death . Sub-plots detract from the main narrative , with Robin Wright a colorless love-interest for convict David Morse and Anjelica Huston lost in a confusingly-written role as Nicholson's ex-wife . Frequent trips to the local strip club muddy the focus of the piece , however the emotional showdown between the two men is wisely examined , heartfelt and exceptionally well-acted . from
Several big laughs , and Russell is a real peach . . .	Ruth McKenney's series of autobiographical articles about siblings from Columbus , Ohio relocated to wacky Greenwich Village was initially turned into a play before this movie version ( it later went back to the stage as the musical " Wonderful Town " , winning a Tony award for Rosalind Russell ) , and in 1955 was filmed again as " My Sister Eileen " with the songs . Russell appears here as Ruth ( the smart , savvy sister who longs to be a writer ) and Janet Blair is sister Eileen ( the pretty blonde with hopes of becoming an actress ) . They move into the noisiest hovel in New York , with a steady stream of foot-traffic and neighbors who barge in without knocking . Some of these characters are colorful , though the comic craziness is pitched a little high , and everyone overacts ( cheerfully ) . Russell ( who got an Oscar nomination for her dryly bemused performance ) sports an awful potato-chip hairstyle which must have been all the rage in 1942 ; her double takes and facial exaggerations are often very funny , and she plays well off Blair ( they take turns playing the jester and the straight-face ) . Is it ridiculous and over-the-top ? Absolutely . But when the results are this friendly , it's useless to complain . from
Love , lust and money on the links ; golfing soap opera is well up to par . . .	Robert Wagner's expressionless approach to acting is utilized to good effect in this soaper involving a playboy golf-pro from the country club circuit who enters a doubles tournament with prize-booty attached . . . and shady dealings on the side . Universal drama ( still unreleased to any home-viewing market ) looks terrific in vivid colors , and features a fine music score from Quincy Jones ( who received an Oscar nod for the film's main theme ) . The characters are not a lively lot ( except for sultry-eyed Jill St . John ) , but the third-act golfing sequences are extremely well done , helping even sports novices to become absorbed by the plotting . Golf is not the most cinematic sport , yet director Ron Winston is very straightforward and focused , and he's careful not to let the melodramatics overshadow the nuances of the game . For golfing buffs and aficionados of ' 60s style , the film can't miss . from
No other actress should ever have to work so hard . . .	Meg Ryan gives a cracking good comedic performance as a woman jilted by her fiancé , flying from Canada to Paris , France to retrieve him , but finding love instead with a scruffy French thief . However , she's the only good thing in the film , which is an underwhelming , cookie-cutter paste-up job . Lawrence Kasdan directs in flighty , old-fashioned spirits , but he can't do much with a sub-plot about the thief's many indiscretions , nor with the detective on his tail ( how original ) , another thief who steals Meg's luggage , a missing passport which never turns up , a stolen necklace , and Meg's life savings of $45K that gets handed over too easily . Not enough attention is paid to the details , but since the romantic angle of the story takes a long while to get its flame on High , what else can we wonder about ? Ryan is terrific , tossing off wisecracks and nonchalant witticisms , but she has to carry this faux-bauble a long way to the predictable finish line . . . and no actress should ever again be made to cartwheel over a dessert tray for a laugh , and then scamper crazily around on the floor splattered with sweets .
Morgan Spurlock charts a fast-food course for his own demise . . .	Healthy documentarian in New York City , spurred on by a lawsuit against the fast-food chain McDonald's by two overweight teen girls , decides to go on a junk food eating binge - - having breakfast , lunch and dinner at Mickey D's for 30 straight days - - to prove not only how unhealthy the food is , but unhealthy our collective eating habits are . Morgan Spurlock targets not only McDonald's in his self-assigned task , but also the food suppliers for America's elementary and high schools , most of whom are drowning today's youth in sugar and high cholesterol . Two-thirds of the way through his experiment , Spurlock's own cholesterol has skyrocketed , his weight is up substantially , and his liver is on the brink of malfunctioning . " Super Size Me " is certainly an informative and thought-provoking documentary , paced in a breezy , lightly amusing style , yet one begins to wonder about Spurlock's main impetus and agenda behind this potentially life-damaging high-fat diet ; frequently using TV commercials ( without their soundtracks ) and animation to underline his points , he intentionally ( and crassly ) becomes a purveyor of shock value ( which is where the footage from a gastric bypass comes in ) . Spurlock himself is an easy-going presence , and he's the perfect Everyman to host this film , but what are his motives ? Is really he really concerned about the health habits of our population ? The many faceless shots of men and women wandering around town with big bottoms and flabby tummies are not shown to be benefiting from any of Spurlock's overall denunciations ( they're just visual targets ) and the segues to the medical personnel don't do much to spike the proceedings ( the doctors seem as worried about Spurlock as Spurlock is about the rest of us ) . In the end , the film is a skin-deep examination of a worrisome issue . McDonald's Restaurants come off not as cause or effect , but as a middlemen : a high-fat supplier we welcome into our lives . Personally , I prefer Del Taco . from
Another big hit for Steve McQueen	Henry Hathaway directs this successful , but lumpy , wayward western-drama scripted by John Michael Hayes , featuring a title character originally introduced in Harold Robbins ' book " The Carpetbaggers " ( making this film a prequel of sorts ) . Steve McQueen is the young half-breed avenging the deaths of his parents by heartless cowboys Karl Malden and Arthur Kennedy ; Brian Keith plays a mentoring , sympathetic gun-salesman who teaches Steve how to shoot ; Suzanne Pleshette is a love-interest from the backwoods . Overripe scenario gets big boost from charismatic McQueen , excellent as usual . The supporting work from the men is also strong , though attractive Pleshette hasn't gotten a handle on her role and remains a puzzlement . The story strays all over the place , but Hathaway's pacing never drags and it's quite a good show for both western-buffs and soap fans . from
Theatrical treatment of gripping well-known material	Harrowing , unforgettable true story of a 13-year-old Jewish girl in WWII Amsterdam who writes of her experience hiding from the Nazis along with her family and friends in an employer's attic . Adaptation of Anne Frank's memoirs by Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett , filtered through the theatrics of their Broadway show , is worth-seeing but suffers from sluggish pacing and unsuitable CinemaScope presentation . The film was hotly anticipated in 1959 , as was the lead performance by newcomer Millie Perkins , yet she's simply too mature and conventionally pretty as Anne ( a 20-year-old model , Perkins reportedly won the part over some 10 , 000 hopefuls ) . The supporting cast fares better , with Shelley Winters winning a Supporting Oscar as Anne's flirtatious neighbor ( the sequence where she brags about her love-life is particularly sweet ) . For those who haven't read the book or seen the play , the film may be a good place to start as it features moving and suspenseful moments . William C . Mellor also won an Oscar for his widescreen cinematography , though it doesn't suit the claustrophobic mood director George Stevens was apparently trying to create . Remade for TV in 1980 . from
As an acting exercise , not bad - - as an entertainment , a hard sell . . .	Based on the true story of a married couple at their wits ' end trying to find a cure for their young son's degenerative disease , " Lorenzo's Oil " chronicles the efforts and challenges of two people who eventually strike out on their own when the established medical profession proves to be a group of naysayers . George Miller directed , co-wrote and co-produced this heavy-going drama which strives to steer clear of wet-eyed sentiment but can't avoid a sort of hard-shelled sentimentality . The quick cuts at the beginning help to speed up the narrative , but they are off-putting and fail to involve the viewer in the proceedings ( perhaps a more careful introduction to this story would've been more beneficial ) . Worse still is Nick Nolte's irritating , overstated performance as the child's Italian ( ! ) father . Susan Sarandon does her usual sterling job as the mother - - the film ends up being a valentine to her valiance and gritty grace - - yet the plot-turns are somewhat mechanical despite George Miller's obvious heart and good intentions . from
Anyone knows an ant can't move a rubber tree plant !	Adaptation of Arnold Schulman's play about feckless Miami Beach widower with a young son who needs a fast loan to save his ramshackle hotel , considering the idea of marrying into money with a shy ( but beautiful ) young widow . Slick , but not very moving comedy-drama won an Oscar for the memorable tune " High Hopes " , but - - with Frank Sinatra , Edward G . Robinson , and Eleanor Parker in the cast - - it should have been much better . The youngster is played by sharp , yet Hollywood-smart Eddie Hodges , who is decent with the kind of lines concocted for him . Frank Capra directed , weakly . Some good scenes , but it runs too long and has too few jokes . from
Smoothly efficient but otherwise routine ghost story . . .	Successful American novelist ( Demi Moore ) living in England is recuperating slowly from the drowning death of her beloved little boy ; she moves to a seaside village to work but is continually surrounded by apparitions and dreams of her child . European theatrical release only made it to DVD in the States , perhaps because it is so routine , with musty clichés clouding the script . Naturally there's a cute lighthouse keeper who lives across the bay ( we know he's heterosexual from the start : he invites Moore to dinner and , of course , burns the fish ) and a town psychic who wanders about making creepy comments ( " Your child is trying to hold your hand ! " ) . We want to like the picture because luminous Moore is so good , but the scenario is full of red herrings ( starting with that lighthouse , which is right out of a 1950s thriller ) and lots of unplayable melodrama . Handsome production , sharp past-and-present editing , but otherwise unimaginative . from
A gaudy rumble in the concrete jungle	Bummer disaster epic with truly stupefying casting : Lorne Greene plays Ava Gardner's father ( what was he ? A horny nine year old ? ) and Marjoe Gortner is Victoria Principal's stalker ( he's a grocery store clerk who's into guns and . . . oh , never mind ) . " Earthquake " does what it promises ( destroys Los Angeles ) , but it doesn't have the requisite scary pleasures of a hammy disaster flick . The filmmakers don't get a kick out of it . The movie is relentlessly downbeat and the actors are kept on the verge of hysteria . Shock effects galore , but it grinds down the audience , all the way to the somber conclusion . I liked Geneviève Bujold as a frisky actress , and Richard Roundtree is fun as a motorcycle-riding daredevil ( with an appealing , rowdy troupe ) , but at this point Charlton Heston and George Kennedy were getting a bit too ubiquitous in these type of surroundings . from ( for the sheer spectacle of the thing )
Straightforward examination of the harried housewife . . .	Natalie Wood in an unsung tour-de-force , playing relatively ordinary housewife and mother who has a mental collapse . Adaptation of Joyce Burditt's popular book , this TV-movie attempts to deal with touchy subject matter in a straightforward , mature , non-exploitive manner , and for the most part is quite successful . While in recovery mode , Wood is unblinking and unblushing , whether relaying her character's personal feelings or describing childhood haunts . The narrative is a bit clogged with medical minutiae ( I would've preferred to see more of Wood at home with her family ) , however the results are relatively well-wrought and quite memorable , and Natalie's work is blessedly unaffected and heartfelt .
So low-keyed it nearly evaporates	Everyone involved in " The Electric Horseman " is taking it easy . The film is just a lark for some very talented people , and while it does have its amusements it doesn't add up to much . Robert Redford plays a rodeo-star who steals his celebrated horse , planning to ride it up to hill country to release it in the wild , but he's dogged by inquisitive female reporter Jane Fonda . There's a message about wildlife to be had in Robert Garland's exceptionally thin script , which must have attracted both Redford and Fonda , but director Sydney Pollack wisely concentrates on the leads ' budding romance , and the horse takes the proverbial backseat . Some of the repartee is sharp , but the movie doesn't particularly look good or seem fully thought out . As a result , it's unmemorable and undemanding , though not without minor enjoyment . from
Another one of Stanwyck's hard-bitten women	Barbara Stanwyck is so good at playing rough-hewn women , characters with a cynical edge , that it's easy to take her presence here for granted . Once again , she is remarkably good as tough cookie returning to her hometown along the waterfront and eventually reuniting with her estranged brother . Marilyn Monroe is also good as a sassy local girl - - although her lines sound as if they were looped in post-production - - and Paul Douglas is terrific as a lovestruck skipper . Tempestuous melodrama is decent fare ; it has heated emotions and florid dialogue , but perhaps more subtlety and nuance would've made it a more memorable picture . from
An interesting failure	When director Bob Fosse set out to make a movie about murdered Playboy Playmate Dorothy Stratten , he obviously saw much of the main plot-potential in Stratten's deranged husband / manager Paul Snider . . . and , distressingly , that's who he seems to identify with throughout . The picture's narrative is immediately shaky because Fosse has no interest in seeing both sides ; he views Snider as a derailed dreamer who thought he finally found fame and fortune ( via his wife ) , and the built-in apologia for Snider's behavior feels sleazy . Eric Roberts is hard to take as Snider , spitting out his lines while twisting his face in rage , while poor Mariel Hemingway is hardly given a chance ( and when her big moments come , she's sluggish and unsure ) . The editing is fairly tight , going back and forth in time while creating palpable dread , though the bloody flash-forwards are numbing , and Fosse's documentary-style eventually exhausts itself . What was Fosse's point ? That Paul Snider was the ultimate victim ? Absurd ! from
Spacy Meg Tilly : the perfect ally for Norman Bates !	Anthony Perkins reportedly felt threatened as an actor playing opposite Meg Tilly ( portraying a slightly-dazed cupcake who befriends Norman Bates , just out of the asylum ) ; if true , he had good reason , for Tilly is very appealing in her role and this sequel to Alfred Hitchcock's classic screamer gains a spirit of its own - - away from its predecessor - - every time she's on-screen . The plot is business-as-usual , with a lot of repetitive , cornball dialogue ( " It's my mother ! " " No , it's MY mother ! " ) . It's great to see those famous sets again , and the filmmakers try to create a stylish , old-fashioned atmosphere at the outset , but a gory , dispiriting conclusion and a dumbbell tag at the end ( designed for another sequel ) weakens the whole shebang . out of
Frettin ' and begettin ' in long-ago Mississippi	Paul Newman as a drifter stud , Joanne Woodward as a 23-year-old spinster ( ! ) , and Orson Welles as a rich blow-hard are the main treats of this adaptation of two William Faulkner short stories concerning boyish troublemaker who arrives in small river-front town and immediately moves up the ladder to success ( he ain't named Ben Quick for nothing ! ) . Newman attempts to woo " old maid " Woodward while working for her wealthy father , who has the entire town under his thumb . Welles , looking like Jackie Gleason and enjoyably hamming it up , is a lot of fun , yet the most interesting relationship in the film is between Newman and Welles ' son , Anthony Franciosa , who feels his position in the family is being usurped by an outsider ( it is ! ) . Some of the writing is unnecessarily flowery , particularly with Lee Remick in the beginning , but the characters do become stronger in the second act , although the plot never thickens beyond your standard radio play of the day . from
" I wouldn't trust him with Whistler's Mother ! "	Perky , freshly-scrubbed , impertinent Jane Wyman trains to be a airline stewardess with American Airlines ; once in the air , she clashes lightly with pilot Howard Keel and passenger Van Johnson , while on the ground she has a slight run-in with Barry Sullivan . All three men - - all named Mike - - quickly come around with romantic notions ( this is the kind of ' 50's comedy where men can't wait to get hitched ) , but Wyman is so busy hatching ideas and shooting from the hip that she barely notices all the male attention . What begins as a smartly-written and executed glimpse at a stewardess's life in the sky is soon hustled right into romantic comedy territory . The question is obvious ( whom will she choose ? ) , yet I didn't find any of these potential suitors capable of handling Wyman , who is continually mouthing off in a wide-eyed , nonchalantly feminine way . This puff-piece , directed with snap but no flair by Charles Walters , is nearly impossible to critique seriously ; if pressed , I would have to say the fist-fight in the photographer's apartment wouldn't really be worthy of the front page of the newspaper ( did the fight last long enough for reporters and shutterbugs to show up ? ) . Walters captures first-day-on-the-job jitters exceptionally well , but Sidney Sheldon's screenplay goes soft too fast . The final line between the men is amusing , but what we don't get see at the fade-out is a career girl who feels alive up in the air quickly tied down in suburbia with kids tugging at her apron . from
Entertaining history lesson . . .	Documentary on the art of cinematography , with a handful of revered directors of photography reflecting on their heroes and mentors , on films which inspired them and ( selected ) projects they've worked on . Despite a lot of smart talk and amusing anecdotes , this project is colorful and entertaining without being especially enlightening ( for instance , only Gordon Willis cites a regret - - a sequence from " The Godfather Part II " ) . Some incredible ( and Oscar-winning ) DP's like Geoffrey Unsworth , Harry Stradling and Peter Bizou are not even invited to the fore , which is disappointing , and the film clips are certainly on the lean side ( hardly anything from the 1950s ) , but what is here is enjoyable , if not intriguing . Financed by the American Film Institute for PBS and Japanese equivalent NHK . from
Curiously sinister and overwrought expose looks great but isn't particularly satisfying . . .	Brassy , singing tomboy near Hollywood in the 1930s gets a screen test and is soon thrust into the crazy spotlight of Tinsel Town . Ham-handed soaper intends to paint show business as cool , decadent and uncaring , but director Robert Mulligan is unable to set an appropriate tone , and his bad guys are enigmatic shadies who conspire in whispers . This combined with Natalie Wood's raucous rendering of a 15-year-old results in some problems . Still , the look and atmosphere of the film are really extraordinary , and Christopher Plummer gives off sparks of neurotic heat as the head of the movie studio . Robert Redford is a good screen match for Natalie , although his love-interest role is steeped in the hypothetical ; Wood herself runs hot and cold , though she has some very strong early moments . The pacing might've stood some picking up , and the movie is much too long , but it looks stylish and has a lot of talent behind it . from
Russ Meyer jawbreaker may silence even the toughest critics . . .	Russ Meyer's " Faster Pussycat " has echoes of other , more popular films in its set-up and design , certainly in its overall impact - - yet this picture is the precursor to those , and as influential cult flicks go , it still stuns today . Three bosomy go-go dancers hit the desert in their sports cars for a little rowdy , competitive fun ; they later end up kidnappers involved in murder after befriending a car-enthusiast and his teenybopper girlfriend . The plot is so reedy and bare it may pass for existential ( you can attach any number of psychological theories to it and feel vindicated by the finish ) . Meyer , who also devised the original story and edited the film , holds back a bit on the overt sex but really lets us have it in terms of kinetic appeal . The picture , shot in crisp black-and-white , bristles with tension and energy , and the characters are so compelling and astutely drawn that even the outlandish plot-devices Meyer throws in hardly come off as cartoonish . Viewers are led ( some may say unwillingly ) wherever this director chooses to take them , and you can practically hear Russ Meyer cackling from behind the camera . Not for all tastes , but adventuresome movie-buffs should feast on this for some time . from
Cheerfully ridiculous . . .	Shapely California blonde cleverly maneuvers her way into Harvard Law School ; soon , the plucky lass is involved in trying her first legal case alongside her professor and associates . . . and you can guess the rest . Perky , though surprisingly not obnoxious fantasy-comedy with jokes leaning towards " Clueless " territory . We never see much studying amongst these kids , yet the film has a great deal of bounce and heart , with many things to recommend it ( not the least of which is an adept Reese Witherspoon in the lead , clearly having a good time ) . The drawbacks would have to include leaden Luke Wilson as a potential boyfriend and too much cartoony hamming . The film has a strong ' oh , brother ! ' quotient , but meet it halfway : if you come out of it smiling , it has done its job . from
Defiance of authority is always good for a few laughs . . .	A rock music-loving slacker impersonates a substitute teacher at a rigid prep school - - initially just for the $650 a week but , upon learning that his 10-year-old students have musical talent , he ends up teaching the class the history of rock ' n roll and puts them to work in a smokin ' hot band . Director Richard Linklater goes commercial ( and cookie-cutter ) in this friendly-enough family film , yet it's one which offers few surprises , beginning with a supporting cast of young actors who are over-trained in precociousness . The concluding events are right off an assembly-line ( is there some movie rule which states an incredible scam can't be pulled off without some concocted interference ? ) . In the lead , Jack Black brings outré enthusiasm and belligerent chutzpah to the mix . . . and the picture would be nothing without him . from
Making death more convenient for everybody . . .	Working-class wife and devoted mother to two small girls finds out she has ovarian tumors which have spread , leaving her with only two months to live ; she decides not to tell anyone her prognosis , instead writing out a list of things to do before she dies and making voice-tapes to her loved ones expressing her emotions . In the lead , Sarah Polley is a good crier ; her line readings are sometimes sweet and sometimes annoying , and she has a bad habit of wiping her hair away from her face and tucking it behind one ear ( all the while stammering over her sentences : " Actually . . . it's , um , like . . . " ) . Still , her natural , mild manner is embraceable , and she works well with Mark Ruffalo as an unconventional prince . Polley's backyard-trailer family is a bit too good to be true , yet the movie - - which is really about living without bitterness - - gets its point across nicely in many intimate scenes . Polley's voice-over ( waxing poetic about the senselessness of material goods , about loneliness , about regret ) is a clichéd habit picked up from the indie-film circuit , yet the finale is quite moving regardless . from
Rollerskatin ' & celebratin ' . . .	Engaging disco fantasy set in 1978 from writer Norman Vance , Jr . , who seems to have overdosed on a mixture of roller-boogie movies and reruns of " What's Happening ! ! " Five teenage friends from the Southside of Chicago are let down after their local skating rink is closed for good , forcing them into the city's deluxe roller palace , where all the coolest cats hang out ; soon they're engaged in a winner-take-all skating contest . Since there were absolutely no decent movies made about the roller disco craze during the 1970s , it's nice to finally get a good one . However , Bow Wow's broken family dynamic - - which chews up far too much of the screen-time - - is doggedly sincere and " emotional " . Perhaps showing more skating practice on the boys ' part might have been more beneficial to the big showdown at the finale . That last act is pure commercial pandering , nearly losing the film's heart and comically-grounded focus . The cinematography is disappointing , as is the editing , although the cast is uniformly excellent and the music is terrifically energized : disco never sounded so good ! from
Heartfelt film is impassioned without being energetic . . .	Strangely low-keyed musical-bio on country great Johnny Cash , his humble beginnings in a dysfunctional household to his first , unsuccessful marriage and quick rise to stardom often alongside future wife June Carter , with whom he had a rocky courtship . Based on two separate books by Cash , the film has very fine musical sequences and keen eyes and ears for the nuances of troubled families , but after the first 90 minutes the film seems to get stuck in a rut . Director James Mangold , a careful and talented filmmaker , doesn't utilize the slower-paced scenes to underscore anything meaningful - - instead it just feels like sluggish narcissism . Cash's drug dependency and eventual withdrawal is well-wrought without a lot of hysterics , but Mangold's staging of these moments is clichéd ( he's seen too many movies himself ) . The budding , on-again / off-again romance with June is surprisingly complicated ( she wasn't one to give in easily ) , but it probably wasn't wise to shape the final chapters of the movie on whether or not Carter would say yes or no to Johnny's numerous proposals ( and Reese Witherspoon's pouty fierceness tends to make Carter look hard-headed in place of willful ) . The picture is surely a handsome one , with lots of fine tunes and terrific period atmosphere , but Joaquin Phoenix peaks early in his lead portrayal ( at the Sun Records audition ) and the other performances are peculiarly uneven . from
Romantic casualties of the Cold War . . .	Excellent young adult performance by 18-year-old Elizabeth Taylor playing newlywed American living abroad whose soldier husband is up to no good : he's living a double life and is really a communist traitor ! Underpopulated , underwritten melodrama does have one strong aspect : a surprisingly strong , spunky woman at the center of the story . Robert Taylor is solid as Taylor's 30-ish husband , but any psychological conflicts are not quick to come out ( there is a tense duck-hunting scene where the couple runs into trouble , but it's just shucked off ) . Liz looks beautiful and gives a fairly complex portrayal here - - her eyes glinting with suspicion and anger . The film isn't a classic , nor is it swill , but as a quickie product from MGM , it's probably better than it had to be . from
" Don't get the trigger itch . . . I want no funerals on this picnic ! "	W . R . Burnett's book " High Sierra " , filmed in 1941 with Humphrey Bogart as a jewel thief , gets a rousing ( and uncredited ) western reworking here , with the main character's vocation changed to train robber . In 1871 Missouri , a criminal set for execution breaks out of prison and holes up in the valley with two of his cronies , where they plot another railroad heist . Director Raoul Walsh ( who also helmed " High Sierra " for Warner Bros . ) gets superlative usage out of the dusty , craggy locations , with cinematographer Sid Hickox capturing the mountain terrain and cloudy skies in gorgeously expressive black-and-white . Joel McCrea is surprisingly comfortable playing the semi-bad guy ( though definitely one with a heart of mush . . . and a yen for marriage ! ) , however some of the supporting characters are a bit of a stretch . Virgina Mayo ( she of the glassy-eyed stare ) does what she can in the insane role of an ex-dance hall girl , Dorothy Malone is completely lost in the underwritten part of a well digger's daughter who wants a better life , and John Archer and James Mitchell are two cardboard villains . The picture gets by on the strength of its considerable technical merits and by McCrea's performance ; with his easy gait and benign personality , McCrea is likable even when he's shooting down the law ( he's shrewd and sturdy , a good man to have around ) . However , the writing is overheated , and the nutty finale provokes unintended laughs . Story filmed yet again by recycle-happy Warner Bros . in 1955 , entitled " I Died a Thousand Times " . from
Comic book cynicism	Surprisingly well-acted , well-written movie about hard rockin'-but-decent young man getting that much-hoped-for ticket to stardom : his favorite heavy metal band wants him to replace their lead singer . Not far-fetched , the film tries keeping things in perspective and doesn't go over-the-top ; it certainly makes you think twice about those lingering adolescent fantasies about being in the music business . But the script , despite solid dialogue , follows a tried-and-true , formulaic pattern , and gets bogged down by its own clichés in the final act . I enjoyed it much more than the sugary fluffball " Almost Famous " . It has a nice , bitter edge to go with its heavy metal decadence , but a stronger finish might've made it more memorable . from
Stark human drama in the " Marty " vein	Paddy Chayefsky adapted his own Broadway play about an elderly workaholic ( Fredric March , in a stupendous performance ) who reaches out to a beautiful woman half his age , but she's got problems of her own , beginning with her shaky self-confidence . Their sometimes-rocky , sometimes-tender courtship provides the basis for this lovely film . As the sad beauty , Kim Novak has seldom been better ( it's rather amazing that professional critics at the time failed to see the growth in Novak as an actress here , focusing all their attention on March , who indeed is terrific ) . Great N . Y . C . locations , fine support from the always-reliable Lee Grant . Worth-catching if it ever shows up on cable , as the picture is still unavailable on video or DVD . from
Tense , atmospheric , well-acted . . . but still not satisfying	Married couple driving through the desert stop off at a diner ; the husband goes into the men's restroom and never comes out . A fascinating premise for a so-so TV-made thriller which does give Cloris Leachman ( Phyllis on " The Mary Tyler Moore Show " ) one of the four best roles of her career ( the others being " The Last Picture Show " , " Young Frankenstein " and " A Girl Named Sooner " ) . Ross Martin is truly scary as the diner's proprietor , and the movie creates amazing tension amidst a realistic rural scenario . Too bad the script isn't as thought-out as one would like . After viewing this on video , a friend and I debated long into the night about what might've been done with the concluding events . The movie doesn't cop-out exactly , but neither does it give us any truly thrilling answers to the wife's predicament . Overall , worth-seeing for Cloris and the promising premise , but I was " Dying " for a better denouement .
Highly enjoyable family film of the 1950s . . .	Baseball and Heavenly fantasy make comfortable movie partners here , as the hot-headed , foul-mouthed ( for 1951 ) manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team learns to clean up his act after he and his losing team receive Divine Intervention on the playing field . Potentially sticky premise gets some heavenly assistance of its own , with Paul Douglas just about perfect in the lead . He's supported by a fine cast , including Keenan Wynn , Janet Leigh ( looking lovely ) , as well as Ty Cobb , Joe DiMaggio , and Bing Crosby in smart cameos . The whimsical script is surprisingly witty , and the direction is straightforward and never too mawkish . Remade by the Disney people in 1994 , with one major difference - - in this one , you don't see the angels . from
Wordy , good-looking soaper for grown-ups	Tennessee Williams and Meade Roberts co-adapted Williams ' play " Orpheus Descending " about a reluctant stud drifting through backwater town , stirring up the passions of an Italian shopkeeper who's married to a cranky invalid . Eerie and fabulously atmospheric piece gives the women in particular ( Anna Magnani , Joanne Woodward , Maureen Stapleton ) great roles to play . Marlon Brando , well-cast as the guitar-strumming gadabout with the bedroom eyes , doesn't seem as fully involved , and his focus tends to wander . Overall , an intriguing soap opera for mature audiences , beautifully photographed by Boris Kaufman and nimbly directed by Sidney Lumet . from
A man , a woman , and a pussycat . . .	A true story set in the African wild which plays like a wild-life fantasy : childless couple working in Kenya ( he's a game warden who hunts ferocious animals ) adopt three orphaned lion cubs and rear them like babies . When they start growing and becoming a household nuisance , two cubs are sent to a zoo but the runt of the litter stays with the couple - - growing particularly close to the wife , who soon finds it hard to let go emotionally when the cub turns into a lioness and is ready for mating . Sloppily-made family film from a best-selling book isn't particularly expressive ; it's a heart-tugger with no headier goal , one designed to inspire lots of " awwww " ' s from the audience . Yet the curiously benign humans at the center of the story are one-dimensional - - they are just good-hearted people who seem to love overgrown kittens - - while the wife's voice-over is in the spirit of a bedtime story ( with careful warnings of what's up coming next ) . The photography is uneven and the direction of the piece is all on one heartfelt note . There's not even much animal excitement here . On a purely sentimental level ( with the theme of ' letting loved ones go ' heavily prevalent ) , the movie is an effective tear-jerker , sweet as candy , and will certainly involve both the young and the young at heart . from
Classic confrontation . . .	Gary Cooper won a Best Actor Oscar for his solid portrayal of a retiring marshal in a tumbleweed town facing down a band of cutthroats all by himself . Confrontation between good and evil still resonates today , cannily filmed in " real time " ( with lots of clocks on-screen reporting the upcoming showdown ) . Edited to precision ( which copped another Oscar ) , stylishly directed and featuring fine supporting performances from Grace Kelly , Lloyd Bridges , Thomas Mitchell , Katy Jurado , Lee Van Cleef and Lon Chaney . Other Oscars : the low-key score and the narrative tune " High Noon ( " Do Not Forsake Me , Oh My Darlin ' ) " . Well worth seeing . from
Dizzying satire , outrageous humor . . . acted and presented with cutting style	Philadelphia is home to the 125th Annual Mayflower Kennel Club Dog Show , which brings out several colorful couples and their prize pooches for competition ( the prize , a silver cup , is big enough to take a sponge-bath in ) . Mockumentary extraordinaire ! Endless pithy witticisms from actor-co-writer-director Christopher Guest , whose troupe includes some really marvelous talent , all of whom get a chance to shine here . Occasionally , the targets are flabby or obvious ( lots of ' bitch ' jokes and a labored marital spat over a squeeze toy ) , but otherwise this is right on target . The outré humor which coated Guest's " Waiting For Guffman " in 1996 ( and had , at times , a sour residue ) is toyed with here in a much more loving way . I got the feeling Guest genuinely liked this group of characters better than the " Guffman " bunch ; and though he does poke and prod at them with his camera - - and encourage his actors to go all the way with the material - - the nimble editing never wears them out , and the picture does not overstay its welcome . from
Despite formula , quite moving	Pat Conroy's autobiographical book " The Water Is Wide " proves to be something of a Southern " Up The Down Staircase " , yet despite the teacher - going - against - the - odds formula , " Conrack " really does move the audience with each little breakthrough and creative flash . These students ( uneducated black kids on an island off South Carolina ) are actually shown learning , and their collective wide-eyed innocence is remarkably sweet . The one actual actress in the bunch ( Tina Andrews , an amazing performer ) plays the " tough nut " Conrack has to crack , and once she falls under his charms , it all seems a breeze . But the story is not ready-made for a happy ending , and I wasn't prepared for the quiet simplicity of the finale . It's beautifully done . The script veers off course every now and then , but director Martin Ritt is very smart to always fall back on Jon Voight's solid presence . Scenes such as the one where he drives around in his van venting his frustrations over a loudspeaker don't add up to much , but the whole film is filled with episodes which spark emotion , and the actual ending is their payoff . out of
Uneven handling alternates between sympathetic , heavy-handed and mawkish . . .	In the iron mines of Northern Minnesota , circa 1989 , a young woman ( a single mother of two with a shady-lady past ) goes to work as a miner and encounters personally degrading harassment from the mostly male crew . A compassionate and sensitive rewriting of a true incident - - one that took some ten years to resolve in the courts - - but possibly overcrowded with too much melodramatic content . Supporting characters - - like Frances McDormand's dump truck driver - - do not get enough quality screen-time to completely validate the time which they do have . The over-emotional finale is also questionable ( were these filmmakers ever in a courtroom before ? ) , but it does provide the audience with the release it needs . In the lead , Charlize Theron gives a finely-wrought , gripping performance ; she shows her guts , fear , and bravery , but I'm not sure how convincing she is as mother to an older teenage boy ( it seems a little soon for Theron , and the same can be said for Sissy Spacek as the proverbial salt-of-the-earth grandmother ) . Does the film show all sides and give both the men and the women a fair shake ? Probably not , but it's not a man-hater movie either , and since it's told from the female protagonist's point of view , her endurance against certain men is the focal point here . Ultimately , the movie is about her courage , her strength in standing up for herself , and this is expressed here extremely well . from
The unpredictable results of needing forgiveness . . .	A recently paroled convict , who as a teenager shot and killed a young convenience store worker , is left to find his way in society ; he's offered a custodial job from a hot-tempered , streetwise pastor , and hopes to connect with the sister of his victim in order to complete the cycle of redemption - - but he finds it isn't that easy . Billy Bob Thornton gives a controlled , emotional performance that comes from deep within . The film isn't quite in balance - - and has some quirky , uncertain moments near the beginning that either don't ring true or just don't feel natural - - but stick with it and you might find resonance in the extraordinary acting and the way the story arcs in just the right way . Terrific casting and performances , atmospheric production and locales , several amazing , emotional moments . from
Bizarre , surreal melodrama	Jill Clayburgh is peculiarly cast as the opera-singing mother of a teenage heroin addict whose motherly warmth towards her son has sensual overtones - - yet , even within this decadent , bizarre scenario , Clayburgh manages to make her presence work , giving a very courageous and colorful performance . It's rather hard to believe those boffo operatic notes are coming out of Jill's rail-thin frame , but no matter . Bernardo Bertolucci's " Luna " is disturbing , provocative , mind-boggling , yet beautiful to absorb . Bertolucci doesn't have much to say about mother-son relationships ( incestuous or otherwise ) , so instead he tells a story of a young boy falling into an abyss , into a dangerous garden of different stimuli . I've heard some critics call the picture ' meandering ' , and it does stray all over the place . However , as a purely visceral experience , there are moments which are breathtaking . from
Kinetic and sneaky , narcotizing and primal . . .	Quentin Taranatino co-wrote , directed and co-stars in this flamboyant , literate , byzantine drama which is structured like a dime-store novel . John Travolta and Samuel L . Jackson are Los Angeles hit-men , Uma Thurman is a gangster's girl whom Travolta is asked to entertain , Bruce Willis plays a boxer on the run after one of his fights ended in death . Critically-acclaimed picture caught fire with audiences as well , resulting in more show-biz success stories than any other film of the 1990's . Is it really that good ? Yes , the verbal interplay and canny , cheeky handling is quite often exhilarating , and the performances by Travolta , Jackson and Willis ( and Harvey Keitel as a low-keyed Mob kingpin ) are near-perfection ; however , the film's mixture of queasy , bloody violence ( undermined by the jokey tone ) and the barrage of foul-mouthed , low-life characters can easily become wearing . It won't be to everyone's taste , surely , but it's a visceral , gripping cinematic experience nevertheless , one with a knockout soundtrack and an Oscar-winning screenplay . from
Has familiar themes , but it is eloquently told . . .	Chris Menges , who in 1992 directed the very fine , unusual Goldie Hawn drama " CrissCross " , takes on another curious , strangely moving film with " Second Best " . William Hurt plays a single , middle-'40's postman in a Welsh village who wants to adopt a boy . We learn why , and we also learn why the young boy who's been selected has such a mercurial nature , but these themes ( childhood-vs . - adulthood , rebellious-vs . - being loved ) , however topical , have been well-traveled . It is Hurt's performance which is something new . The way he moves his head quickly to avert an emotion or a confusion , the way he smiles when surprised . . . the man is , of course , an actor , but he's not actorly ; he's not a beguiling trickster , he is an actor of deeply human emotions . When he loses his temper at the kid , it's not unusual to find him saying the next morning that he's willing to continue on this path . It's a refreshing piece of work by Hurt , who I feel has been erratic since " Altered States " brought him to prominence . The youngster , Chris Cleary Miles , is kept low-keyed and he's very natural ; John Hurt is very funny and fine in a brief supporting role ; Alan Cumming looks a little theatrical and out-of-place as an adoption caseworker ( at first I thought there was going to be a dreadful sub-plot involving Cumming as a villain ; thank God there wasn't ! ) . A fine film , it does fiddle with a few camera tricks to convey emotions not in the script , but these flourishes were not necessary : the lead character and his desire to be a good , decent father manages to express a lot more . out of
A sterling drama ; complex and surprisingly emotional . . .	Lengthy but well-realized , highly absorbing adaptation of a serialized Stephen King novel concerning prison guards in the 1930's who are profoundly touched by one Death Row inmate . Unpleasant subject matter ( and several vile supporting characters ) don't detract from the emotional value of the piece , which is professionally handled despite one or two small missteps ( an execution scene , for instance , which runs too long ) . Terrific acting by Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan , exceptional production design and cinematography . Some may quibble over the epilogue , but it's a sweet touch in a movie which has a surprisingly large heart . from
Any movie with aimlessness at its core is going to seem straying to some . . .	Despite an occasional misstep , I felt writer-director Sofia Coppola's sure-hand throughout this rather lovely film about isolation finding an outlet in admiration . While not a love story per se , " Lost in Translation " is very romantic and charming as it ambles along , bringing two kindred spirits together . Coppola seems to excel in a forlorn melancholy that is as beautiful as it is perplexing ( you may wonder , " where is she going with this ? " , but then just as quickly realize that a schedule here isn't the purpose ) . Bill Murray has several funny scenes , he's very much at home with Coppola's low-key approach , and the movie has only a few awkward stops ( an outburst at a party is perhaps more fuzzy than anything else ) . Murray is comfortable in his scenes with enchanting Scarlett Johansson , and their quiet repartee is marvelous . Where other directors might have made the simple plot ( about the alienation any human being would feel in a foreign country ) seem slim and meandering , Coppola lets sequences breathe and take their own shape . She stays out of Murray's way but also keeps him grounded - - he's funny and amiable but never strident . The picture has a fantastic alt-rock song score and an unfettering eye for the craziness of a desperately with-it Tokyo . from
The wildest behind in New York City !	A party-line turns an interior decorator and a songwriting ladies ' man into enemies - - that is , until he gets a look at her . When Doris Day is forced into a nightclub by a junior-suitor , she makes the best of it and does a shimmy on the dance-floor in a tight white dress - - you can't blame Rock Hudson ( at a nearby table ) nor the cameraman for zooming in on her derrière , which wiggles seductively and comically . This businesswoman is really a closeted gal-about-town , and Day gives one of her freshest , funniest performances here . I also liked the tinkly background score and the handful of songs ( the title cut , " Roly Poly " and " Possess Me " ) , but apparently Doris didn't . In her autobiography , she scathingly dismisses all the music from her ' 60s bedroom comedies as " mediocre " , blaming her skinflint husband for bypassing top-rank composers like Henry Mancini for " a bunch of no-names " . Why Doris ! ! from
Intelligent , heartbreaking drama	Movies about suicide are certainly not going to be pleasant from the outset ( and I know several people who refused to watch " Surviving " simply because of its theme ) , but I think viewers will find something special here . Ellen Burstyn plays a doctor's wife and mother who clouds her life with activity so that she can't see what's really going on ; Marsha Mason is a friend of hers , a working mom who got fed-up a long time ago and can't muster the courage to care anymore . Their two eldest children ( Zach Galligan and Molly Ringwald ) are embarrassed by their parents , are convinced they are in love and wish to escape . The opening montage of family photos and the sad , wistful score is highly evocative ( and all the shots of Ringwald are fascinating - - she manages to convey depth of character even in still photographs ) . Mason has a more complex role than Burstyn , but Ellen ( after coming out of her fog ) has several strong scenes , particularly when berating her youngest son ( River Phoenix ) for taking sleeping pills ( " How COULD you . . . how COULD you , Phillip ? " ) . When Mason breaks down on her front lawn , it's tough not to cry right along with her . " Surviving " doesn't tug at your heartstrings for effect ( it's not " Love Story " ) , it earns the tears you give it . The film was notoriously snubbed at Emmy time and got surprisingly low ratings ; it's worth rediscovering . from
