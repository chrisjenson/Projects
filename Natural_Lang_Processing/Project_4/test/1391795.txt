A Waste Of Time , Money , And Talent .	Tim Matheson plays gubernatorial candidate Al Donnelly , whose campaign is constantly being hurt by the antics of his well-meaning but hopelessly clumsy brother Mike ( the late Chris Farley ) . Weasely , ambitious Donnelly campaign worker Steve ( David Spade ) agrees to " babysit " Mike and keep him from embarassing himself and his brother . Really , all you need to read is the title of my review . That's all you need to know . This movie is lame , embarassingly unfunny and annoying . I know that Farley COULD be funny , but an hour and a half's worth of his blustery , over-the-top , yelling-at-the-camera physical comedy is more than enough . And Spade's character is such a sarcastic little worm that he becomes tiresome . Don't get me wrong , I laughed at Farley's antics occasionally . His " Motivational Speaker " skits on SNL were hilarious . I'm just not too fond of his feature-film vehicles . And the first film to pair Farley and Spade ( " Tommy Boy " ) was more than enough . I'm not too happy that generally entertaining actors like Gary Busey , Christine Ebersole , Grant Heslov , Timothy Carhart , Bruce McGill , and Tim Matheson are wasting their time with such material . Then again , if you're a fan of Farley , I think you'll be satisfied . It's just a matter of personal taste , after all . For me , though , it gets a .
These people have some nerve thinking they made a scary film !	Second film version of Shirley Jackson's memorable nail-biter novel in which researcher Dr . David Marrow ( Liam Neeson ) lures a trio of insomniacs to an enormous and opulent mansion under false pretenses in order to study their reactions to their environment . Before long , all matter of " scary " occurrences are happening to the group . Sometimes this expensive , elaborate dud of a thriller doesn't do TOO badly , but that's when it rehashes scenes from the original . It's when it starts going off on its own merry path , showing the audience EVERYTHING and leaving nothing to the imagination that it fails . Just because these film-makers had access to state-of-the-art modern-day special effects didn't mean they HAD to use them . This movie ends up trashing everything the classic 1963 film version stood for . Cast is variable - Neeson is a professional , but doesn't seem to have genuine enthusiasm for the material ( then again , could you blame him ? ) . Catherine Zeta-Jones ( looking very sexy ) and Owen Wilson are okay at best . Lili Taylor does the best , creating a sympathetic and endearing character that the audience may be able to root for . Other than Taylor's performance , the most interesting thing about the film are the interior and exterior sets . The film LOOKS amazing . Incidentally , the producers , Donna Arkoff Roth and Susan Arnold , are the daughters of B-movie legends Samuel Z . Arkoff and Jack Arnold .
One of the characters , upon seeing a " Welcum " sign : " Why don't I feel welcome ? "	A gaggle of kids - standard slasher movie characters , all of them - who are associates of one of the first film's survivors , go to the desert to race their bikes and test their experimental fuel - and are menaced by the surviving mutant ( Michael Berryman ) from the first film , as well as a new ugly thug , " The Reaper " ( John Bloom ) . Silly sequel ; truly a disappointment from a talented horror veteran ( Wes Craven ) , from whom I expect more than just a run-of-the-mill slasher film , which is what this is . The first film could have been seen as a statement on the breakdowns of family units , but writer / director Craven obviously didn't care about making Part II particularly intelligent . Highly reminiscent of a " Friday the 13th " movie , with a Harry Manfredini score that sounds much too familiar . Cast is nothing special at all , though it is amusing to see Penny Johnson ( Jerald ) , recently of the TV series ' 24 ' ( she played Sherry Palmer ) , paying some serious dues , and to see Janus Blythe reprise her role from the first film . Michael Berryman is fun as always ; with those distinctive features of his , he was born to be a cult actor . The fiery finale is okay . You know you can't take a movie seriously when even the dog has flashbacks !
Even worse than " Prince of Darkness " , this is the worst thing Carpenter's ever done .	Fatally dull horror anthology with " Tales From the Crypt " aspirations in which film-maker John Carpenter , playing a Crypt Keeper-type coroner host , tells three stories . 1 . " The Gas Station " : Alex Datcher plays a young woman who has an eventful , spooky first night at her new job as a graveyard shift gas station attendant . Has some good Carpenter touches , but mostly uninspired story has only the prospect of Robert Carradine playing a psycho to recommend it . Frequent Carpenter actor Buck Flower plays a bum for the umpteenth time in his career . 2 . " Hair " : Stacy Keach plays a guy whose hair loss is driving him crazy . He goes to a special clinic , run by David Warner ( there's your first clue that they're up to no good ) . EXTREMELY dull , and dragged further down by Keach's over-acting , but has a fairly decent pay-off . 3 . " Eye " ( which is actually directed by Tobe Hooper ) : Mark Hamill plays a star baseball player who loses his right eye in a car accident , and in a " Hands of Orlac " type plot twist , receives a new eye from a donor whose identity is not revealed to him at first . Hamill is actually pretty good . In short , it almost seems as if Carpenter were asleep at the wheel when he made this ( he may also send the viewer to sleep ) . He may make little bits and pieces of the film entertaining , but on the whole the film is a failure . I'm so disappointed . Carpenter himself is reasonably amusing , and has cameos for two of his contemporaries : Hooper appears at the end , and - what have we here ? - there's Wes Craven appearing in " The Gas Station " ! Even Roger Corman pops up . Otherwise , don't waste your time with this piece of waste .
At least you get to see a victim yanked into a dumpster .	A killer goes on a spree during New Year's Eve celebrations , claiming a victim each time the clock strikes midnight in each time zone , directing all of his rage at a popular DJ hosting a night-long concert in L . A . Uninspired slasher movie , made with little to no talent or imagination , with zero scares , awful music , an unsympathetic lead , bad performances ( especially the psychiatrist ) , and very little of the elements ( namely , sex and violence ) that make hardcore slasher fans want to check these movies out in the first place . The rock music is actually fairly catchy ( in particular , the title theme song , which we get to hear repeatedly ) but some user comments have commented on an inaccurate depiction of the early 1980's new wave / club scene . ( To that end , the extras are often laughably crummy . ) The familiar faces give it some novelty value - Roz Kelly ( ' Happy Days ' ) as the diva-like DJ Blaze , Kip Niven - one of the motorcycle cops from the Dirty Harry sequel " Magnum Force " as the killer ( " No , not bad . Just EEEEEEEEvil ! ! ! " ) , whose true identity may be too easily figured out by some viewers early on , and Grant Cramer ( " Killer Klowns from Outer Space " ) as the too-obviously disturbed son . A very small victim role is played by veteran performer Louisa Moritz - often typecast in bimbo roles - whom you may have also seen in " One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest " or " The Last American Virgin " . Dedicated slasher fans could do better than this ; despite the fact that clearly more money was spent on this film than others of its ilk , it doesn't produce any better-than-average results . An early effort for Cannon Films , which went on to produce a large number of action films - often Charles Bronson and Chuck Norris vehicles , thrillers , as well as some genre efforts , throughout the 1980's . Good for some ( probably unintentional ) laughs , but not much more .
I Can Refuse It . . . And I Will .	In the tradition of the " Hot Shots ! " and the " Airplane ! " movies , this is a spoof of mobster movies , " The Godfather " and " Casino " in particular ; Anthony Cortino ( Jay Mohr ) is selected by his clumsy father Vincenzo ( Lloyd Bridges ) to take over the family business . I'm very sorry to say that I was disappointed with this movie . Usually , I enjoy this kind of material , but I did not laugh often enough this time . The movie is rather flat throughout ; sure , there are some good laughs , but overall the movie fails to provide even acceptable entertainment . And I'd swear , the movie almost seems to be taking itself SERIOUSLY at times ( in some of the flashback scenes ) ! What a bad move ! Cast is OK but nobody can match the success that Lloyd Bridges has with Vincenzo . He'd already proven himself adept at this kind of material and he , at least , doesn't disappoint . I just wish he could have had a better swan song than this . He'll be sorely missed . I give it ( and that's after a little generosity on my part ) . I hope if co-writer / director Jim Abrahams makes another movie soon , that it's better than " Jane Austen's Mafia ! " ( Probably one of the funniest things about the movie is that title . )
I didn't really care for this one too much . . .	Less-than-thrilling , routine slasher entry about demented sadist who butchers the mascot of a college basketball team and uses the costume as a disguise while reducing the amount of student bodies on campus with home made " claws " , while a night-long scavenger hunt takes place . A warning to the unfamiliar : you have to sit through a first half mostly consisting of obnoxious , asinine characters goofing off and providing comedy relief that is sometimes funny but mostly irritating . Then the hacking and slashing begins . The film provides the viewer with some atmospheric , suspenseful moments but mostly the film is a 97-ode to deja vu . The gore is amateurish , there's no sex quotient , and there's maybe one good scare in total . Some familiar faces can be seen : the top-billed Julie Montgomery was , of course , Betty Childs in " Revenge of the Nerds " , and co-star Lauren-Marie Taylor also fell victim to a killer in " Friday the 13th Part 2 " . Character players like Rutanya Alda ( " Mommie Dearest " , " Amityville II : The Possession " ) and Richard Bright ( " The Godfather " , " Red Heat " ) have small roles , and a slumming Hal Holbrook turns up presumably because his own son David also has a role in the film . I assume people who wanted to make slashers back in the early 1980's were exhausting themselves trying to come up with different costumes for their killers , but a bear costume ? That just comes off as looking silly . I wouldn't really recommend it - it's mostly for die hard slasher completists who aren't very demanding . I myself found the film to be silly and not very satisfying ( chalk up another underwhelming ending ) , and found my patience tested a little too much at times .
Not what I expected , or was hoping for .	Cheap 1950's sci-fi about malevolent alien entity that takes root in the desert and manipulates the minds of animals and humans in an attempt at domination . A small farming family is all that stands between it and its goal . The poster makes this look like a different kind of film , like a goofy monster ( albeit a neat looking monster with a good gimmick ) on the loose programmer . Instead , it's a slow , talky , serious drama touching on such subjects as , for example , the human capacity for love . The titular thing doesn't even make an appearance until the very end , just because at that point I guess we have to be shown something . For the most part , the films ' subtle , plodding nature almost does it in . Paul Birch is a stolid lead , and a very young looking Dick Sargent plays a good-guy cop , but I found the other actors a little underwhelming , although Lorna Thayers ' performance gets a little better as the film goes along . Chester Conklin is very amusing as the cantankerous old farmer . I found that I just couldn't have that much fun with it , or get that involved . It gets some points for being actually kind of a thoughtful film , but it's not as entertaining as other schlock films from the same era . Ultimately , I was a little disappointed .
Don't ever house-sit for Roger Cobb . . .	Roger Cobb ( William Katt ) is an emotionally distraught Vietnam veteran turned horror novelist whose life has been turned upside down after his son mysteriously disappears . His soap opera actress wife Sandy ( Kay Lenz ) divorces him and to top it all off his loony Aunt Elizabeth ( Susan French ) has committed suicide in the house where Roger grew up . When Roger moves back into the house , his sanity is tested when he is tormented by nightly visits from ghosts and demons . Twisted , off-the-wall horror comedy , more effective in its comedic portions , because it just isn't scary . I liked Roger Cobb enough to root for him , and I was generally amused by this movie . The casting of two comedic actors ( George Wendt , Richard Moll ) as respectively the neighbor and the villain is effective as a bit of stunt casting because the both of them were then on the sitcoms ' Cheers ' and ' Night Court ' . Lots of ( deliberately ? ) cheesy effects and ghoulish creations , although I'd actually prefer these sort of effects to animation , to tell you the truth . The supporting cast also includes a few familiar character faces , including daytime soap actor Stephen Nichols as one of Cobb's Vietnam comrades and Mindy Sterling , the future portrayer of " Frau Farbissina " in the " Austin Powers " movies , as a bookstore customer . It also has two very sexy female co-stars in Lenz and former Miss World Mary Stavin . Incidentally , the boy playing Stavin's son is director Steve Miner's own child . After this Miner would start branching out into other genres , returning to the horror genre in the 90's for the movies " Halloween : H20 " and " Lake Placid " . I liked it but basically it's about average .
Quite a silly movie .	Ridiculous but somewhat amusing B horror about anthropology professor Vincent Van Patten , who takes four sorority girls , including squeeze Betsy Russell , into the mountains to look for ancient artifacts . What they find are 1 ) a dopey motorcycle gang and 2 ) a towering , heavily made up druid ( played by seven foot tall Tiny Ron ) looking for human sacrifices . I guess you can't fault a movie too heavily when two minutes in we get shot after shot of bare breasts , as well as shower scenes . Give director Thom Keith credit for that . But the point seems to be to get this sort of thing out of the way so he can concentrate on the main plot of the movie . In any event , it's positively stupid and probably in no way meant to be taken completely seriously . We even get a brief glimpse of a hilarious Loch Ness Monster type creature . What is particularly fun is watching the surviving bikers teaming up with our studly hero to help save the day . Tiny Ron is enjoyable as the grunting and growling antagonist , and it's nice to have Betsy Russell on hand as one of the girls . An undeniable highlight is having scene-stealing , inimitable old pro Buck Flower as a hopeless , disheveled drunk ( often muttering warnings about " devils and demons " ) , the kind of role that he could have played in his sleep by this point . I admit that this one was a little hard to stick with ( I could have done without that musical number / dance sequence ) , but it's still fairly enjoyable junk .
Could have been better ; as it is , it's basically good for laughs .	Civilians and the military alike have to work together when an enormous extraterrestrial bird comes flying down to earth and picks off people and planes at a rapid clip . Electronics engineer Mitchell McAfee ( Jeff Morrow ) , mathematician Sally Caldwell ( Mara Corday ) , scientist Karol Noymann ( Edgar Barrier ) and generals Edward Considine ( Morris Ankrum ) and Van Buskirk ( Robert Shayne ) hurry to come up with a plan to destroy the relentless flying menace . This film has such an air of sincerity to it - right down to the narration - that it's a shame that the special effects basically ruin the whole thing . The giant bird is so ridiculous - yet hysterically funny - that it's anything but scary . Just check out those rolling , bulging eyes on the stupid thing . It's that silly . Just as amusing is watching the darn puppet pick up model trains and cars and fly off with them . The actors , the majority of them very familiar faces from the era of 1950's science-fiction , play it with incredible seriousness . In the style of other B pictures from this period , it's dialog-heavy , with much scientific jargon that may have some viewers rolling their own eyes . On the plus side , director Fred F . Sears ( whose more substantial credits include " Earth vs . the Flying Saucers " and " The Werewolf " ) keeps it moving well enough to have it clock in at a reasonable running time of about an hour and a quarter . When all is said and done , I look at it as being an engaging bit of nonsense . The laughs may be unintentional , but they are still welcome .
Don't expect anything special , with a title like that .	Paul Walker and Steve Van Wormer play Phil and Stew Deedle , two slackers / surf bums who pass themselves off as aspiring Yellowstone park rangers and work to thwart the plan of villainous former ranger Slater ( Dennis Hopper ) , who's started a prairie dog infestation that he hopes will divert Old Faithful . This is not an adult's ( or critic's , needless to say ) picture by any means . Beyond being just stupid , this amazingly goofy movie will probably appeal mostly to kids - with way too much supposedly hip lingo and visual gimmickry . Another flaw : the overuse of the words " Deedles " and " p-dogs . " But you know what ? I didn't hate it . I've seen worse than this . It has a certain silly charm , even if it's not that intelligent . Likable cast , and good soundtrack , too . Two great novelties about it : the chance to see Robert " Freddy Krueger " Englund in a rare non-horror role as one of Slater's henchmen , and the ( hilarious ) chance to see Eric " Victor Newman " Braeden pontificating and reciting silly dialog . I give this dumb-but-enjoyable movie . ( I know , I know , I probably shouldn't look at myself in the mirror too closely while saying that . )
Speak Now , Or Forever Hold Your Peace .	Young couple Tom ( Ashton Kutcher ) and Sarah ( Brittany Murphy ) meet cute at the beach and , on an emotional high , get married soon after . The main premise of the movie is that their honeymoon turns out to be a disaster . . . There are a number of awkward and boring moments in the first half , but it gets a little better as it goes on . When all was said and done , however , I didn't laugh a whole lot . The movie manages to coast for much of its running time based on the very likeable young actors in the leads . It's Kutcher who manages to get most of the laughs ; he can get laughs with just a facial expression ! I don't think it's really that good but I also find it a hard picture to hate . At the very least , those who are so inclined can enjoy that beautiful European scenery . I feel bad for actress Veronica Cartwright . Appearing uncredited ( as Sarah's mother ) , she has to utter the movie's stupidest line . Are there any people in real life with the same nickname as her character ? Mainly noteworthy for the fact that Kutcher and Murphy were a couple in real life as well . . . for a bit . Now of course , his star's shot into the stratosphere because he's dating Demi Moore . Anyway , I gave this one . I heard that critics everywhere tore this movie to pieces , but come on , give me a break , what were they expecting ? " Roman Holiday Part Two ? "
I thought that it was okay .	Eric Binford ( Dennis Christopher ) is a wimpy , whiny nerd who lives with his shrewish Aunt Stella ( Eve Brent ) and whose whole life revolves around the movies . It's only a matter of time before this skinny Norman Bates clone snaps , and he does it in record time , killing anybody who ever mistreated him while dressed as various movie bad guys ( he has a particular affinity for Cody Jarrett , the psycho played by James Cagney in " White Heat " ) . " Fade to Black " is just an average movie , although I think that it may have more appeal to the film buff than the casual viewer . A number of vintage film clips are scattered throughout ; I would guess that writer / director Vernon Zimmerman is himself a devoted aficionado of classic Hollywood films . The film itself is entertaining enough to keep it watchable ; star Christopher is perfectly cast and does a respectable job ( at least , I thought so ) . Marilyn Monroe look-a-like Linda Kerridge - whose name in the movie is Marilyn - is appealing as the aspiring model that Eric falls for . Lapses into some tiring cliches about the ideas of a bleeding-heart liberal ( Tim Thomerson ) clashing with those of a more hard-aed cop ( James Luisi ) and climaxes in a stand-off on top of Mann's Chinese Theatre . Personally , I don't think that the violence is that excessive - not when compared to subsequent thrillers . A younger Mickey Rourke pops up in one of his earliest film roles . ( If you're an old movie buff , you might rate this higher )
Low-budget genre fare is laughably bad .	Norton Cyberdyne is a multinational company in the business of manufacturing military technology . Their pet project is the title creature , designed to be the perfect soldier . Young Susan Valentine ( Starr Andreeff ) gets wind of all of this when one of these things kills her uncle Ethan ( Lewis Arquette ) , who was the brains behind the project . She teams up with goofy reporter Nick Cary ( Mitchell Laurance ) to take down the creature - designed to be impervious to most weaponry and to asexually reproduce every 24 hours - and the company , whose boss Carter Brown ( David Gale ) is going absolutely bonkers . This is undeniably a very silly movie , but it's got some things going for it . First of all , there's a tongue-in-cheek quality to the proceedings . The actors ( especially Laurance and Gale ) wisely don't take it all that seriously . ( Charles Lucia is also funny in a key supporting role as a weaselly executive . ) The creature is a recycling of the monster designed by director William Malone for his own 1981 movie " Scared to Death " , so it's cool that it was allowed a second go-round here . The film looks good enough , with some highly amusing special effects and fairly decent pacing . The lovely Andreeff is appealing in the lead , with the sexy Riva Spier entertaining as the conniving Paula and cute Melanie Shatner ( William's daughter ) as the ill-fated Bonnie . But David Gale pretty much becomes the whole show . He hams it up to the nth degree , and is downright hysterical at times . If you loved him in the " Re-Animator " movies , you should get a kick out of what he does here . " Syngenor " ( as in SYNthesized GENetic ORganism ) is just ridiculous enough to be a good time for those who enjoy bad B movies . I know I do , and I found it pretty entertaining .
A stupefyingly messed up movie .	This certifiably silly slasher entry is basically about a family struck by a series of murders . One family member in particular ( played by hardcore porno actress Samantha Fox ) has just gotten out of a mental hospital and is having a hard time dealing with the outside world . I just read one of the user comments here that said if one is new to the works of Doris Wishman , this is not the picture to start with . Uh-oh . If , like me , you are largely unfamiliar with this lady , she was one of the rare female film-makers to work in exploitation features . She was a true independent operator who did things her own way . She passed on in 2002 but left behind a large body of work spanning four decades . This attempt by Ms . Wishman to add to the slasher genre is largely bungled by the apparent loss of half of her rushes by the lab . The result is a disjointed movie that makes little sense from scene to scene , with mind-boggling changes in music and soundtrack that couldn't possibly be less appropriate to the scenes . The omnipresent narrator , a device which needed to be brought in to explain the whole " plot " , is good for some laughs , and Ms . Wishman does provide the viewer with two of the mandatory staples of the genre : gratuitous female nudity and plenty of juicy graphic violence . ( Gore fans are sure to get a kick out of this if they can put up with the balance of the movie . ) Pretty much everything about this is on the inept side , but it's so bizarre it's fascinating . I can't say that I actually enjoyed it , but it's such a demented curio that it kept me watching . A must for the curious . . . others , BEWARE .
Looking For " Just Cause " To Watch This Movie ? Read On .	African-American death row inmate Bobby Earl Ferguson ( Blair Underwood ) appeals to Harvard law professor Paul Armstrong ( Sean Connery ) to get him released from prison because , after all , he didn't commit the murder he was convicted of - yeah , I know , that's what they all say . Armstrong does some investigating down in the Florida Everglades with Lt . Tanny Brown ( Laurence Fishburne ) , the lawman who coerced Bobby Earl into confessing . Paul finds that things are not as they seem with this case - sound familiar ? The biggest problem here is that this is NOT a faithful film adaptation - lots of changes are made from John Katzenbach's fine novel , starting with making the main character a law professor instead of an investigative journalist , as well as casting the 60-something Sean Connery in the lead when the character in the novel was considerably younger . One significant change is stupid and makes no sense . In that sense it IS a disappointment , but if you haven't read the novel and / or don't intend to , this may hold up as an acceptable albeit forgettable thriller . The cast gives exemplary performances , especially Fishburne and a riveting Ed Harris , that are better than the film really deserves . Co-star Christopher Murray , who plays J . T . Wilcox , is the real-life son of Hope Lange ( who has a small part here ) and Don Murray . Also , that's current " it " girl Scarlett Johansson ( " Eight Legged Freaks " , " Lost in Translation " ) as Connery's daughter . This is a routine movie without the same impact as the novel - it's not as compelling despite some upsetting subject matter . I don't think it's quite as slick as other , similar Hollywood films , either .
I've Done Over 200 Reviews Now . . . Incredible .	Continuation of the events in the first " Final Destination " ; Kimberly Corman ( A . J . Cook ) has a horrifying premonition of a catastrophic highway pile-up that ends up coming true . When she and several others manage to avoid the accident , she comes to suspect that , just like the characters of the first movie , death will come for them ; she seeks help from Clear Rivers ( Ali Larter ) , the sole survivor of the first movie . Horror sequel is a typical genre gorefest ; it's a lot less subtle and a heck of a lot more bloody than the first movie . The film-makers seem to have been far more concerned with devising gruesome , nasty ways for people to die than anything else . It's not without entertainment value ; it's well-paced and watchable and at least I wasn't regularly checking my watch . Cook is unconvincing in the lead , and some of the supporting characters are unrelievedly stupid , but at least Tony Todd , reprising his role of mysterious mortician Mr . Bludworth , makes the most of his brief cameo . Definitely a comedown from the first movie , though I'm sure some genre fans will be satisfied . I gave it .
" Just give me one night alone with the body . "	Your friendly neighborhood environment-polluting corporation is turning the residents of a small , small rural town into sick , diseased , zombie-like killers who seem to prefer the night life . Two vacationing big city boys ( Wings Hauser and Lee Montgomery ) pass through just in time to get caught up in these creepy ( if derivative ) events . For what is - low budget independent genre fare - it's really not all that bad . All of the gore and makeup is not as bad as some reviews might lead you to believe - it's just limited by what these film-makers have to work with . The acting is about what you'd expect as well - not inspired , but acceptable , good enough for this kind of film ( another familiar , and welcome , face in the cast is veteran good ol ' boy actor Bo Hopkins , stuck in an unimaginative part , but amusing as always ) . Director John " Bud " Cardos and company try to give this movie some semblance of atmosphere ( whoever was in charge of the fog machine sure earned their pay ) . Ultimately , the film doesn't really deliver in terms of real scares , but I wouldn't consider it a totally botched job either . The film-makers do display an " anything goes " mentality here - you'll see what I mean at about the 80-minute mark - and the finale is not too bad . I did rather enjoy the music from Richard Band , because it did help to set a serious tone . Despite similarities to the usual run of zombie movies , these creatures at least do exhibit some interesting , unusual traits , which helps the movie to rise ever-so-slightly beyond being just average . Overall , fair entertainment for those who want to check it out . It's known as " Mutant " on DVD so if you do go looking for it , that's the name you have to search for .
Notice how sometimes , in movies , electric chairs just aren't enough ?	The barbaric , extravagant serial killers that get fried in them find a way to return , as does Max Jenke ( an entertainingly hammy Brion James ) here . Captured by dedicated detective Lucas McCarthy ( a typically solid Lance Henriksen ) , Jenke is the sort of bad guy who loves to taunt the hero . And boy , does he taunt him . Now existing in some other spiritual plane - or dimension , or however you want to think of it - he strikes back by inducing McCarthy to have hallucinations - and targeting the detectives ' family . In an odd bit of sequel film-making ( and surely there are many horror fans that already know this ) , this film was titled " House III " for overseas distribution ( producer Sean S . Cunningham was also producer on the first two " House " movies ) , although it would have been a sequel in name only . Then the more or less official sequel " House IV " was released a few years later , leading to this unconventional situation that we now have . By any name , this horror movie is passable enough - it may do well as a rainy-afternoon sort of affair . It's never what I could consider scary , but it's not totally lacking in suspense ( for once , I was treated to an it's-only-the-cat gag that actually worked ) , and , in an early credit for them , the K . N . B . EFX group supply some decent makeup effects . That turkey has to be seen to be believed . The acting is decent right down the line ; there's a surprising amount of familiar faces in supporting roles - Rita Taggart , Dedee Pfeiffer , Thom Bray , Matt Clark , Lawrence Tierney , Alvy Moore , Terry Alexander , Lewis Arquette . But it's really Henriksens ' and James's show ; Henriksen shows that he can be as good playing the hero as the villain in this sort of fare . James's Jenke is flamboyant , more a campy villain than a truly frightening one , but he is entertaining . He's got an annoying laugh , though . Absolutely nothing special , but fair viewing for undemanding genre fans . It's not entirely predictable , which is nice , and it moves well enough . It's just ultimately the kind of horror fare that I find more amusing than anything else . In closing , I want to point out that one of the screenwriters is credited using the notorious pseudonym of " Allen Smithee " , leading me to wonder what the reason is for that .
Not bad - has some decent laughs .	Obnoxious , irresponsible George Kuffs ( Christian Slater ) leaves girlfriend Maya ( Milla Jovovich ) after learning she is pregnant . In need of money , he hits up brother Brad ( Bruce Boxleitner ) for a loan but ends up taking over his brother's privately owned police precinct in San Francisco after Brad is coldly gunned down inside a church . Using the supposedly true-to-life hook of these privately owned and funded police precincts in San Francisco , the rest of the movie is pure movie-universe comedy : a terminally offbeat , silly , who - cares - about - being - realistic affair with some good laughs ; thankfully , for me , the best ones tended to occur more towards the end , especially when Kuffs is trapped in the laundry with Thunder the dog . Performances are generally entertaining ; despite the nature of the George Kuffs character , at least thanks to Slater's work I can at least laugh at ( and with ) him . ( To that end , it's now a worn-out cliché to have the lead character of a movie address the audience directly , but I have to admit that I did laugh at some of his dialog . ) Jovovich provides interested viewers with the requisite amount of eye candy , and is able to convey the essential sweetness of her character . Tony Goldwyn , following up his career-breakthrough performance as the " friend " in 1990's " Ghost " , is obliged to engage in some truly silly comic relief as the grouchy cop saddled with babysitting Kuffs as punishment for his indiscretions . Finally , there's the offbeat casting of a ballet dancer - George de la Pena - as the smug , businessman-type villain , and the amusing presence of Leon Rippy ( " The Patriot " ( 2000 ) , ' Deadwood ' ) as the thug with the wackiest wardrobe since the days of Ralph Furley . Boxleitner is very good in his brief time on-screen . Harold Faltermeyer , best known for his highly memorable " Beverly Hills Cop " music , contributes another funky , likable electronic score , even though it does sound a little familiar . People here seem a little divided ; most reviewers either love it or loathe it . I don't think it's any comedy classic but it's good for some entertainment . Pay close attention and you'll see Ashley Judd cowering behind a paint store counter .
Not-bad chase thriller with good setting .	Three cross-country runners ( Ronny Cox , Art Hindle , Tim Maier ) on an epic run through the Southwestern U . S . desert run afoul of some predictably mean and nasty militia men on a training exercise . The bad guys end up taking things too far and the runners ' struggle for survival is underway . " Courage " - also known as " Raw Courage " - is a fairly good little thriller that certainly doesn't deserve to be as obscure as it obviously is . A labor of love for top-billed Cox ( he also wrote , with his wife Mary , and produced ) , it plays out in a surprisingly plausible and down-to-earth fashion , without becoming overtly melodramatic or patently unrealistic . The heroes / victims , forced to use their wits to survive , are average Joe types who aren't always certain of what they are doing , and not every move they make works out . While not being quite as involving as I would have liked , it's easy enough to get caught up with the protagonists ' plight and root for their plans to succeed ( in that sense , it is kind of comfortably predictable - you like the good guys , hate the bad guys , and cheer at the end ) . Cox , as could be expected , does a solid job in the lead , and the great character player M . Emmet Walsh is his usual entertaining self as the misguided nemesis . Other performances are acceptable if not on the same level . ( Unfortunately , the ladies present don't get to do much ; former Bond girl Lois Chiles is wasted as the girlfriend of Hindles ' character . ) One complaint I had was with the music score , because at times it doesn't work ; during tense sequences when I should have been more " on the edge of my seat " , the music wasn't helping . Overall , this little movie is certainly passable enough . Like I said , it's not as stimulating as I would have liked , and in general it feels very familiar , but it's not a bad effort . There's no way it deserves to be just automatically written off . With Cox and Walsh as the two nemeses , that's a little bit of value right there .
Six Out Of Ten .	Black comedy about three high school students ( Katie Holmes , Marisa Coughlan , and Barry Watson ) who confront their icy , miserable history teacher ( Helen Mirren ) in her house and wind up in a series of events that snowball out of control . Supposedly , debuting film-maker Kevin Williamson ( the writer of " Scream " and " Scream 2 " ) based Mrs . Tingle on an actual teacher that he had in school . While I am amazed that any teacher could be as evil and heartless as this one is , I was generally amused by the picture . Make no mistake about it , though : don't rent or buy it thinking it's going to be some sort of thriller or suspense story ; it's basically goofy stuff that ought not to be taken seriously . The cast is fine , but none of them can quite match Mirren , who hits just the right note as Mrs . Tingle - she is completely convincing , although like I say , the source of her evil is dumbfounding and never really explained by Williamson . One source of amusement is a bit of casting that kind of comes full circle : Molly Ringwald , once a teenaged star of teen-oriented movies , plays a school employee in this film . I thought it was entertaining but nothing special ; " fairly good " is how I think I would put it .
Teenagers ! What WILL they think of next ? Giant spiders ? ? ? HA HA HA ! ! !	Two stupid teenagers , in search of the girl's missing father , enter a cave and find an enormous bird spider that inevitably causes a ruckus that forces the local authorities and experts to pursue it and " kill " it . They put it on display in a high school gym ( waiting for some university bigwigs to take it away for study ) , but it wakes up and escapes so all the heroes have to go after it again ! Enjoyable cheap 1950's era drive-in fodder from American International Pictures , silly enough to be fun , horribly and inevitably dated in some ways ( in particular , the lingo ) , but that's actually part of what makes these pictures fun in the present day . Some of the reviews that I've read say the same thing : that it's easier to endure than most of the " giant thing on a rampage " pictures churned out by legendary schlock master Bert I . Gordon . Well , there's still a number of his films that I haven't seen ( although I consider 1977's " Empire of the Ants " to be a real hoot in its ineptitude ) , so I can't say the same yet , but for this kind of film it ISN'T too bad . The teen-aged leads ( many of these teenagers , in the tradition of motion pictures for all time , really look to be in their twenties at the least ) are wholesome and dorky and the adults either macho , know-it-alls ( like the science teacher hero played by Ed Kemmer ) , or hilariously contemptuous and skeptical ( like the sheriff played by Gene Roth ) . The effects are also somewhat better than one might expect . All in all , it's an amusing way to spend ( or should I say kill ) a quick 73 minutes . Although made after some genuine " giant insect / arachnid " classics of the 1950's like " Them ! " and " Tarantula " , and naturally , not being in the same league as those films , there is at least one thing tying it to " Tarantula " : the presence of actor Hank Patterson , who played Josh in that film , and who plays Hugo here . By the way , there's a scene with a movie theater here that enables Gordon to shamelessly promote his other movies from this period , like " Attack of the Puppet People " and " War of the Colossal Beast " . Re-made for cable TV in 2001 , but using only the same title , with a much different plot line , as part of the " Creature Features " series , which did the same thing for other 1950's A . I . P . features , for example , " How to Make a Monster " .
Not-bad Cold War era thriller .	In order to start a war between Israel and the United States , some Russian operatives steal some plutonium and plant a bomb in a Saudi Arabian oil field . It's up to super-agent Ken Wahl and his small fighting force to save the day , assisted by sexy Mossad agent Alberta Watson . A twisty , intrigue-laden hardcore action movie with a touch of James Bond-style adventure to it , " The Soldier " is fairly entertaining stuff that proudly wears its air of patriotism on its sleeve . It hits the ground running and gets off to an energetic start , and hits us across the face with some sharp bursts of violence here and there . The ski chase scene is undoubtedly a standout portion , especially considering the stunt that our cooler-than-cool hero pulls off in order to mow down the thugs pursuing him . The acting is pretty good , with Wahl making for a very stolid and resolute hero ; co-starring are William Prince as the President of the United States , Joaquim de Almeida and Steve James ( a familiar face in other action movies of the 80's ) as two of Wahls ' team members , Klaus Kinski in a disappointingly very small cameo appearance , and one can also see folks like Zeljko Ivanek and Jeffrey Jones in bit parts . The Tangerine Dream score is typically solid and atmospheric , adding substantially to the entertainment value . James Glickenhaus , director of other 80's movies like " The Exterminator " and " Shakedown " , keeps the movie moving along steadily and directing with conviction , giving us an enjoyable climactic car stunt to cap the movie . Not quite as much fun as , say , the over-the-top ridiculousness of the Chuck Norris vehicle " Invasion U . S . A . " , but still pretty watchable , " The Soldier " should be decent viewing for action and spy fans .
Who wouldn't mind having Shannon Tweed for a neighbor ?	Our plot here can basically be summed up as " the boy who cried Satanist " . Handsome , affable high school senior Billy Colton ( Derek Rydall ) is known for telling stories , so when he claims that his grouchy jerk history teacher Mr . Willard ( Allen Garfield ) killed his sexy neighbor Lisa ( Shannon Tweed ) in a Satanic ritual , no-one's going to believe him . Least of all the cops . Desperate for some proof to validate his story , Billy turns to former cop Ron Deveraux ( Elliott Gould ) for help . I wouldn't consider any of this " horror " either ; it's ultimately lightweight stuff . It's watchable enough , but the story and presentation are pretty routine . There are no scares ( even the " Boo ! " moments are yawn-inducing ) , there's no suspense , and not too much in the way of gore , either . Some folks may find it worth their while for the amount of female flesh displayed ( the victims are all hookers ) . Tweed is very easy to watch in her brief time on screen , with hardcore porn star Teri Weigel playing scared convincingly as another victim . It's pretty much the cast , full of familiar faces , that give it any sense of value . Rydall and Teresa Vander Woude are likable as our hero and his love interest , although Scott Fults is just not funny as the obnoxious best friend and supposed comedy relief . Old pros Gould , Garfield , Richard Roundtree , and Michael J . Pollard are all worth watching ; Garfield and the terminally weird Pollard make for a highly unlikely pair of brothers but their interesting relationship at least offered an unexpected twist to the story . References to " Psycho " here are barely worth mentioning . Like I said , this is watchable , passable stuff ; it doesn't have a lot going on but I didn't find it painful to go through either .
Not bad , considering my expectations weren't that high .	After the death of a much-hated / feared patriarch named Rufus Sinclair , his venal surviving relatives are marked for revenge after they have gone against the wishes of his will . One at a time , they are dispatched in the manner that they fear most . This was on my list of curiosities to see , given that it's the first major role for a young , but still instantly recognizable , Roy Scheider . Of course , he wasn't a star then , but he delivers a nice little hammy performance as the drunkard of the clan and is the main reason to watch this murder-in-an-old-dark-house programmer . Drive-in schlock expert Del Tenney handles his material capably enough , giving it some atmosphere , and it's a highly amusing if absolutely unspectacular film of its kind . The acting , if not all that terribly good , is amusing as well , and it's underscored by a typical schlock movie score . Overall , it's a fairly entertaining movie , and given that there's a fair bit of skin revealed and a little bit of graphic mayhem , it comes off as a little more ambitious than a standard low-budget genre effort would ordinarily be , as Tenney tries , on his budget , to go the classy route and make this an antiquated period piece . I liked it well enough ; it's good for some laughs , and mild chills . I've certainly seen worse than this . The final twist doesn't come as a great shock , but that doesn't seem too important given that the story is trite to begin with and doesn't warrant any deep involvement . Look for Candace Hilligoss of " Carnival of Souls " fame in her only other film role , as Deborah .
It has its moments .	Joey Faust ( Douglas Kennedy ) is an underworld figure and expert safe-cracker sprung out of the joint by nefarious Major Krenner ( James Griffith ) . Krenner , a spy , wants to turn the criminal invisible so he can steal radium ; however , this is just one step on the road to Krenners ' plans to take over the world with invisible soldiers . As handled by prolific B movie director Edgar G . Ulmer , this movie - an obvious relic from the Cold War era - really is over in record time : it's less than an hour long ! It hits the ground running and comes up with a fair amount of amusing twists , telling its fanciful story in efficient no-frills style . The acting is pretty decent ; the movie benefits from having a recidivist S . O . B . who's rather engaging in spite of not being a typical clean-cut hero . The main characters are often duplicitous types - even the hapless scientist ( Ivan Triesault ) in the villains ' employ doesn't hesitate to be manipulative when he has to be . They also have a tendency to always be holding guns on each other . It's hard not to laugh at the scenes where actors have to mime being punched or throttled , but this movie is overall more of a lightweight lark than any portentous , serious sci-fi effort , so it just adds to the spirit of the thing . The special effects really aren't that bad . It's quick , painless , and passably entertaining .
Fine murder mystery .	Successful mystery writer Cornelia van Gorder ( feisty Agnes Moorehead ) temporarily moves to a mansion in the country known as " The Oaks " . Meanwhile , a million dollars ' worth of securities has been embezzled from a bank , and hidden in that mansion . The stealthy , villainous title character , outfitted with a mask covering his face and finger-claws that immediately call to mind 80's horror icon Freddy Krueger , is on the prowl , out to claim the booty for himself . Based on a play ( filmed a few times previously ) , this lively murder-in-an-old-dark-house mystery has enjoyable twists and turns and more than enough red herrings . It's fun to try to figure out where this is going and the ultimate identity of " The Bat " . It's respectfully atmospheric and moves at a good clip . The cast , including the always delightful Vincent Price and former Our Gang member Darla Hood , is fine , and the mansion , with its secret rooms , is a good location . It's an entertaining little movie with some fine moments . Although I myself eventually realized that there was only one person that " The Bat " could turn out to be , getting to the reveal was still enjoyable . It's an engaging film of its type .
Good , stylish mummy horror .	The powerfully attractive Valerie Leon is Margaret Fuchs , daughter of Prof . Julian Fuchs ( the always solid Andrew Keir ) . Fuchs and his team of archaeologists live to regret breaking into the tomb of diabolical and alluring Queen Tera ( also played by Leon ) . The evil Queen has been perfectly preserved and is now forcing her eternal spirit on the hapless Margaret , while the villainous Corbeck ( an excellent James Villiers ) plays a large part in the proceedings . Mummy stories ( this was based on Bram Stokers ' " Jewel of the Seven Stars " , filmed again in 1980 as " The Awakening " ) always have a potent exotic quality to them , and this is no exception . It's a good late entry in their legendary run for Britains ' Hammer Studios , with a very palpable sense of menace and doom . The plot is enticing yet not too hard to follow , and a number of fine scenes are created . The finale in particular is quite entertaining . Leon is such an outstanding visual asset it may be hard to concentrate on other aspects of the film when she is on screen . She also delivers a good performance , struggling to resist the influence of the Queen on her mind . Keir , Villiers , Mark Edwards ( as Margarets ' concerned boyfriend ) , Aubrey Morris ( as a wonderfully eccentric doctor ) , James Cossins ( as an asylum attendant ) , George Coulouris ( as an associate of Prof . Fuchs who has gone mad ) , and Rosalie Crutchley ( as another member of the archaeological team ) round out a most enjoyable cast . The movie has a straightforward and serious approach , generating decent atmosphere and moving inexorably towards a well-realized downbeat and mysterious ending . One of the most significant aspects to the production was a " curse " of sorts to occur in real life : director Seth Holt died during production , to be replaced by Hammer executive producer Michael Carreras . Peter Cushing , originally cast in Keirs ' role , did a days ' shooting only to lose his beloved wife and subsequently leave the production . This does lend the film a certain uneasy mystique , prefiguring the later stigma surrounding the " Poltergeist " series . This is worth seeking out for lovers of mummy movies everywhere .
Actually superior to its predecessor .	An official prequel to " The Amityville Horror " , this movie is loosely based on the fate of the real-life DeFeo family who moved into the notorious Long Island home . The horrific actions of the homicidal eldest son Sonny ( Jack Magner ) are blamed here on demonic possession . Heroic priest Father Adamsky ( James Olson ) realizes what he's up against and actually goes against the wishes of the church , taking it upon himself to exorcise Sonny . After giving " Amityville II : The Possession " a new viewing and a re-assessment , I can appreciate it more . Screenwriter Tommy Lee Wallace and director Damiano Damiani deserve credit for going for a truly dark and disturbing approach . They tackle such sensitive topics as child / spousal abuse , incest , and mental illness and while these elements are going to make the movie too unpleasant for some viewers to stomach , they nevertheless add a strong amount of real , disconcerting horror to this material . The movie does a better job than the first film at establishing an atmosphere . It's a genuinely creepy film with an intense variety of supernatural phenomena . The hidden room in the basement is another fine touch ; it plays a part in a fairly good sequence late in the picture . The makeup effects are well done and Lalo Schifrin's memorable music score is as effective as ever . Impressive camera-work succeeds in conveying the feeling that the demon responsible is everywhere at once . The acting is variable . Burt Young portrays the monstrous father quite believably , and Diane Franklin is very cute and appealing as the teenaged daughter . Jack Magner as the possessed Sonny and Olson come off very well , but Rutanya Alda's histrionics as the high-strung mother are a little too much , and Andrew Prine is wasted in a minor role as Adamsky's associate . Moses Gunn is good as Detective Turner as is Leonardo Cimino as the disapproving chancellor . Aside from an ending too obviously inspired by " The Exorcist " , this is still a reasonably entertaining horror film with some fine moments .
Entertaining overview of a great career .	Narrated by Leonard Nimoy , this enjoyable documentary charts the evolution of legendary special effects master Ray Harryhausen . I enjoyed seeing all of his work , and hearing his own comments . All of the major films that he worked on are mentioned , including " Mighty Joe Young " , " The Beast From 20 , 000 Fathoms " , " The Valley of Gwangi " , " 20 Million Miles to Earth " , and so on . Among those interviewed are Dennis Muren , Henry Selick , Ray Bradbury , and George Lucas . If , like me , you have enjoyed the characters , creatures , and fanciful worlds that Harryhausen has created , this will serve as a fitting tribute to the man . It's not long-winded or drawn out and it's consistently interesting . I hope to see more of his films in the future .
Corny , cheesy , not particularly imaginative , but still good fun .	Riding the wave of other genre pictures from the late 70's to the early 80's , Columbia Pictures gave us this contribution . A mixture of science-fiction , fantasy , and adventure , it sees an all-powerful " Beast " landing on a planet inside a " Black Fortress " that can disappear and re-materialize on a 24 hour basis . With the help of thuggish " Slayers " , this evil creature starts decimating the population and abducts young princess Lyssa ( Lysette Anthony ) , while she's in the process of marrying young warrior Colwyn ( Ken Marshall ) . Colwyn , spurred on by feisty Ynyr ( Freddie Jones , delivering the standout performance of the picture ) , hooks up with a motley gang of thieves who become his steadfast allies . All of this while he's managed to obtain a magical flying weapon dubbed " The Glaive " . The $27 million production can be easily seen in a number of impressive sets shot at the renowned Pinewood Studios . These range from a massive chamber full of cobwebs , presided over by " The Widow of the Web " ( Francesca Annis ) , to forests , canyons , & swamps and the stylized lair of The Beast . Coupled with the generous array of special effects , this picture certainly delivers the goods in visual terms . Veteran director Peter Yates , who's shown an impressive ability to work within a variety of genres in the course of a distinguished career , does good work at creating some enjoyable set pieces . The whole sequence with Jones and Annis is rather poignant and for me was the highlight of the movie ; in fact , the supporting cast tends to outshine leads Marshall ( who is a very likable sort with a resemblance to Dennis Quaid ) and Anthony ( very pretty and enticing ) . Future stars Liam Neeson and Robbie Coltrane are among the thieves . Alun Armstrong , whom you may have seen in one thing or another , is fun as Torquil and David Battley supplies the movie with its silly comedy relief as he changes into one animal form - goose , pig , basset hound - after another . Nice exterior location shooting and a nicely rousing early score by James Horner also help in the enjoyment of this amiable movie .
It made me laugh , what more can I say ?	Based on the first novel by award-winning Miami-based humorist Dave Barry , this is the story of various characters - street thugs , bomb-smuggling immigrants , high school kids , an embezzler , two hitmen , two cops , a newspaper man-turned-advertising writer , etc . whose lives come together in an eventful couple of days . Noteworthy as one of a few movies whose release date was delayed for several months after the horrible events of ( another was the Schwarzenegger vehicle , " Collateral Damage " ; I can't remember the other one ( s ) ) . Fast , loose , and often genuinely funny movie is a certifiable farce , with some good lines and outrageous situations . Overall , it's a little above average for a comedy - so many fail because they are more lame than funny , or paced badly , or just boring . At least this movie delivers some actual laughs . It gets an extra point from me just for the excellent comedy cast alone . Hey , you know what would go great with this movie ? A big bag of Fritos ! " My name's Puggy , and I live in a tree . I hope I haven't ruined anything for you . "
Gotta love that final showdown . . .	According to other User Comments here , this is a noticeably faithful adaptation of the H . P . Lovecraft story " The Case of Charles Dexter Ward " , previously filmed ( although less faithfully ) in the 1960's , as " The Haunted Palace " with Vincent Price . Well-off scientist Ward ( Chris Sarandon ) has his curiosity get the better of him when old family artifacts come into his possession . His distraught wife Claire ( Jane Sibbett , probably best known as Ross's lesbian ex-wife on ' Friends ' ) goes to private detective John March ( John Terry , seen since on TV series ranging from ' E . R . ' to ' 24 ' to ' Las Vegas ' to ' Lost ' ) and asks him to find out just what weirdness her husband is up to . Although more drawn out than I think it needed to be ( that " haunted house walk " goes on for a pretty long time before anything really happens ) , this is actually reasonably entertaining , with director Dan O'Bannon ( directing for the first and only time since 1985's " The Return of the Living Dead " ) capably bringing the story to life . I will say this . . . when O'Bannon decides to let the audience have it , he REALLY lets them have it , with impressively hideous splatter . Sibbett and Terry are merely OK , but Sarandon - who ends up playing more than one role - is definitely worth watching . Robert Romanus , a . k . a . Mike Damone of " Fast Times at Ridgmont High " is on hand as March's leg man . The dark and rainy skies of British Columbia work to set the mood for this little horror piece , worth catching for fans of the genre . Incidentally , for those of you who have asked , this has recently been released on DVD by Lions Gate , but in full screen only and with absolutely no extras . Too bad .
Interesting vampire film .	In the future , genetic experimentation has given rise to a new and advanced variation on the human species . They are known as " The Brotherhood " , and exist to serve their less advanced counterparts . Things take a turn for the worse when a Brother named Edgar ( a marvelously intense Leo Gregory ) contracts a virus . Becoming unhinged , he declares war on humans , determined to spread the virus around . Edgars ' brother Silus ( a brooding Dougray Scott ) has to stop him , with the assistance of lovely police detective Lilly ( the appealing Saffron Burrows ) . I was expecting a fairly typical B movie , but " Perfect Creature " is anything but . It deserves some credit for attempting yet another cinematic spin on the vampire genre . The intelligent screenplay ( by director Glenn Standring ) may be headed towards a standard , inevitable final showdown between the two adversaries , yet doesn't have a real air of familiarity to it . A grim , gloomy , and thoughtful movie , it sets the mood immediately and maintains it up until the conclusion . It nicely captures a look of despair . The stylish look involves lots of red ( this should prove to be gory enough for some viewers ) but not a lot else in the way of color . Granted , it's sometimes more flashy than it really needs to be ; it could have done without the choppy editing and grandiose , stylistic touches common to many modern movies . Scott , Gregory , and Burrows are supported well by Scott Wills as the surly Detective Jones and Stuart Wilson as Brother Augustus . Overall , it's not a bad way to kill 88 minutes .
Some knowing laughs for slasher fans .	A teenage girl left home alone by her mother is terrorized by a hockey mask wearing psychopath who's naturally escaped from a mental hospital . And that's the whole plot of this amusing horror short . What is most impressive is all the trouble director Dakota Thomas goes to to evoke the 80's , when slashers were at their most popular . The choice of music is particularly funny , especially when " Holding Out for a Hero " plays during a climactic moment . Slasher fans will also recognize the romantic piano melody from the end of " Friday the 13th " , and the opening credits tune from " A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 : The Dream Master " . Thomas certainly knows how to drag out the clichés for laughs , especially that old " the killer isn't dead " routine . A certain ominous atmosphere is also maintained . The killer is also one of those silent types , a la Jason Voorhees or Michael Myers . All in all , anybody like me who's always had a soft spot for these kinds of flicks should get a bit of a kick out of this . The gore is good for whatever the budget must have been and the short definitely put a smile on my face .
Hippies and a vampire make for an interesting combination here .	The late , great Robert Quarry is once again a vampire in an A . I . P . picture . The difference here is that he's not a dapper Bulgarian blood sucker but an enigmatic stranger with mustache , beard , and wig , who mysteriously appears one day and entrances a group of hippies . The philosophical musings that he utters are of great interest to them , but of course all he really wants to do is feed on them . " Deathmaster " wouldn't be as notable were it not for the magnetic presence of its star . Quarry is a pleasure to watch . His character is inspired by the notorious Charles Manson , and has a certain charm about him . One can see how easily impressionable people would fall for such a person . He really makes his existential dialog come to life . The picture serves as a good snapshot of the early 70's and parts of its culture . It looks good for its low budget ( $110 , 000 ) and actor-turned-director Ray Danton keeps the picture moving along well . The supporting cast isn't too bad . LaSesne Hilton ( in his only film role ) has a very striking face as the vampire's familiar , prominent character actor John Fiedler is engaging as the unlikely source of assistance for would-be hero Pico ( Bill Ewing ) , and sexy Betty Anne Rees , playing Esslin here , would turn up two years later as Quarry's girlfriend in " Sugar Hill " . It's also a real hoot to see Bobby " Boris " Pickett of " Monster Mash " fame as one of the hippies . Makeup effects and gore are passable , and the music by Bill Marx is effective enough . " Deathmaster " may come off as pretty dated now , but that actually plays a part in its appeal . It truly belongs in its own time and place . It's a good dose of low-budget 70's exploitation horror .
The kills in this one are what really sell it .	Not bad independently made slasher in which a child named Ed is cleaning his fathers ' firearms as a birthday surprise for the old man and accidentally shoots the wife / mother . Ed Sr . appears to lose it at that point . Several years later , Ed is a high school student played by the likable Matt Mitler . ( The box says he's a high school student , but he looks more college age . No matter . ) The old man requests that Ed Jr . do him a favor and close up the beach condo . Eds ' friends think this will make for the perfect vacation . Not really . Once night falls they will get picked off in increasingly brutal ways . This picture fulfills its requirements / clichés adequately . We've got standard-issue , obnoxious ( if also actually rather funny ) , sex-starved kids , an attractive cast , a decent dose of nudity , and a script comfortably written to formula . Cinematography is murky but never so murky that one can't see what's going on ; the music is acceptable . My major complaint is that it's a little too protracted ; better pacing would have helped . What makes this worth catching is the gore ( take my advice and try to find an uncut version ) . It gets more and more nasty as the film goes on ( what happens to Sue ( Connie Rogers ) is especially cringe-worthy ) and is very convincing . Overall , it's decent if unexceptional slasher fare . If you watch this sort of thing specifically for the graphic violence , it should fit the bill nicely .
A pretty effective woman-in-peril thriller .	Sarah ( Mia Farrow ) is staying with relatives in Britain , and while she is out with an old flame named Steve ( Norman Eshley ) , her aunt ( Dorothy Alison ) and her family are murdered by a mysterious sicko , whom we in the audience can only identify by his boots . Now , of course , the killer is after poor Sarah , not knowing that she is in fact blind . It's a race for Steve to get to Sarah before the killer can return and finish what he started . From Brian Clemens , whose other credits include writing and directing the 1974 Hammer film " Captain Kronos : Vampire Hunter " , comes this refreshing and well-made little film . Old pro Richard Fleischer guides it with a steady hand , and he and his crew go to great , intriguing lengths to always keep the killers ' face off camera . He really puts Mia through the ringer here ; appealing as always , she plays blind ( as well as terrified ) convincingly and proves to be a real trouper as part of her ordeal involves crawling through mud . One interesting touch is to have key moments play out without an accompanying music score , such as the reveal of the dead bodies , and even when Sarah finally realizes what's happened . As soon as Sarah understands that she's in jeopardy , the movie picks up its pace noticeably , although it ends with more of a whimper than a bang . This certainly goes against the grain of thriller conventions , as well . The fact that we never really learn anything about this murderous stranger - aside from the fact that he enjoys movies with titles like " The Convent Murders " and " Rapist Cult " - adds an incredible amount of mystery to the film . A subtle , atmospheric film with a nicely eerie feel to it ( the clay pit is an impressively gloomy looking location ) , " Blind Terror " a . k . a . " See No Evil " is a good vehicle for Farrow and a pleasingly well-crafted thriller .
Beware the lady in gray .	A nice mixture of the contemporary and the Gothic , this occult tale features two feuding families , the Whitlocks and the Laniers . In modern times , the Laniers , in the name of progress , are bulldozing their way through a cemetery , and desecrate the tomb of a Whitlock from the 16th century - a witch , killed by being buried alive . In the name of revenge , death comes to the Laniers one at a time . With lovable old pro and genre star Lon Chaney delivering a fine lead performance with real gusto , this decent horror film is good for some chills and thrills . Jack Hedley is a stolid hero , and Jill Dixon , David Weston , and Diane Clare contribute likable supporting performances . Yvette Rees is a striking presence as the cold-eyed , vengeance-crazed , undead - and somehow , quite alluring - witch . It's a good looking film with sharp black and white photography and some good sets . It has atmosphere , suspense and a really intense , fiery finish . Written by the prolific Harry Spalding ( " House of the Damned " , " The Earth Dies Screaming " ) and directed with conviction by Don Sharp ( " The Kiss of the Vampire " , " Curse of the Fly " ) , it's a solid and engaging if not exceptional movie .
Decent Hammer production .	Anton Diffring plays Dr . Georges Bonnet , an esteemed doctor in 19th century Paris who dabbles in sculpting . He's also a man with a secret : as one can guess from the title , he's managing to put off his demise and extend his life , but he often resorts to very nefarious methods to do so . Morally upright surgeon Pierre Gerrard ( a dapper and smooth Christopher Lee ) gets enmeshed in his scheme when Janine Dubois ( lovely Hazel Court ) , with whom Pierre is smitten , is targeted by the desperate Bonnet , with whom Janine has a romantic history . Diffring is quite good and a marvel of edgy , twisted desperation , and manages to arouse a fair bit of sympathy . Court and Lee offer fine support , as well as Arnold Marle as Diffring's disapproving associate and Francis De Wolff as the perplexed Inspector stuck with a strange case to solve . Michael Ripper of many other Hammer films and Charles Lloyd Pack have small roles . This was based on a play by Barre Lyndon , previously filmed as a 1944 movie called " The Man in Half Moon Street " . It has the feel of a play in that it often consists of characters talking , but is also a typically good looking Hammer production and the story is reasonably entertaining . The makeup proves to be disappointing and the ending feels a little rushed , but the actors make it all worthwhile . Minor criticisms aside , it's still a polished and elegant film from a studio that put a lot of class into its colorful genre pictures .
I enjoyed this film .	In this serving of 1970's era sleaze , two brothers are dominated by their shrewish mother , who decries young women as being " evil " . Frank ( Gary Kent ) has a Jekyll and Hyde type personality and can switch from being approachable to being hostile . Johnny ( John Stoglin ) is enthusiastic and has the mind of a child . With the blessing of dear old mom , they regularly kidnap young women and hold them prisoner in their basement ; these poor ladies are basically used as playthings for Johnny , who especially likes to play doctor . This isn't as all-out sleazy as I was expecting ; it's actually somewhat restrained . Doses of nudity are limited . What makes it hum are its details ; mom had a particularly disturbing relationship with Frank , for one thing . The plot has definite shades of " Psycho " , and also works as a precursor to the 1980 feature " Mother's Day " . It has a playful vibe to it ( when one character makes an escape attempt , the soundtrack actually incorporates shouts of " Run ! " ) , albeit a very kinky and seedy sort of play . It plays with expectations in one way , seeming to set up one victim as the possible lead , then killing her off in short order . In the end , it becomes rather sad , and it's hard not to feel something for some of the characters . Writer / director Don Jones creates some genuinely interesting characters , well acted by the cast . Kent and Stoglin contrast well as the two brothers , with Cheryl Waters a strong and feisty presence as Bonnie . The other two girls have such haunted looks on their faces that it's easy to see how their experience is taking a toll on them . The music isn't always too effective ; it's sometimes not suited to the scene it's accompanying , such as the suspense scenes . One good touch , however , was the moving camera . " Girls in Chains " is worth a look for any viewer interested in the low-budget exploitation titles of the 70's . It's sad , sordid , and sleazy to a respectable degree .
This trash is worth a look before taking it out to the curb . . .	Hunky paleontologist Kevin Hall ( Michael Sopkiw ) hitches a ride with another expedition to a locale deep in the Amazon jungle . Their plane crashes , killing some of the folk on board . Among the assorted troubles that the others will endure are leeches , piranha , a fierce local tribe that pray to a dinosaur god , and miners / slave traders . A handful of the expected elements combine to make this an agreeable time killer . There's the expected doses of sex and nudity ( and the ladies in question , Suzane Carvalho and Susan Hahn , are so delectable as to make this quite a pleasing asset ) . There's also a fair helping of gory violence , a lush tropical setting , an upbeat electronic score that is hard to resist , and a high body count . There's even some actual intentional humor . This exploitative trek through the jungle may not be on the level of " Cannibal Holocaust " , but it does just fine as a no-brainer adventure . Sopkiw , whose looks and personality are reminiscent of Bruce Campbell , makes for a pretty engaging hero . The acting / dubbing is naturally and typically unimpressive , but , really , who watches this sort of thing hoping for Oscar-worthy performances ? The characters are perfectly annoying and it's amusing to watch them succumb to a variety of nasty fates . Overall , it's a purely fun picture . Silly , to be sure , but a real hoot . Too bad we don't see more of this type of picture nowadays . Don't expect any actual dinosaurs , though .
An amiable boy-and-his-robot tale .	Scientists Ralph Harrison ( Charles Drake ) and Arnold Nordstrom ( Taylor Holmes ) both consider space travel tests on human subjects to be too dangerous . Their solution is to create the title robot ( Lew Smith ) , who will be sent on the first space flight . They've programmed Tobor with the ability to both feel and react to human emotions . Tobor proves to come in handy when dastardly enemy agents ( led by a creepy Steven Geray ) kidnap Nordstrom and his scrappy , wholesome grandson " Gadge " ( Billy Chapin ) in order to force Nordstrom to spill all his secrets . The primary word that sprang to my mind while watching this was : likable . It gets a little intense at one point while never becoming too unpleasant . It wouldn't be bad for family viewing . The characters are engaging enough and the plot very straightforward ; it moves along quite well to a satisfying conclusion . The sight of Tobor driving a jeep , on the other hand , is one of the flat-out funniest things I've seen in a while . Basically , it's all in good fun . Drake makes for a stolid and ultimately two-fisted hero , while Holmes , Chapin , and Smith as Tobor form the real heart of the picture . Nice bit performances by such familiar folk as William Schallert and Peter Brocco are also quite enjoyable . " Tobor the Great " is a pretty cute little sci-fi tale .
A likable enough minor 1960's horror film .	Architect Scott Campbell ( Ronald Foster ) and wife Nancy ( the winsome Merry Anders ) are sent on an architectural survey job by lawyer friend Joe Schiller ( Richard Crane ) . This involves settling into an old castle-like mansion with an expectedly dubious history . And , wouldn't you know it , they experience one strange incident after another . The title makes this little film sound more ominous and intense than it really is . In fact , while this film packs enough tension and mystery into its very short and sweet 63 minute running time , it's really ultimately a harmless little diversion with an ending and revelation that's anything but scary . The acting is very engaging , and both Anders and Erika Peters as Joes ' sassy wife Loy are certainly very easy on the eyes . The atmosphere of this low-budget film is created well , and the photography is quite good ( I would agree with other statements here that this picture would certainly benefit from being viewed in its proper aspect ratio ) . The direction by Maury Dexter is efficient , the music sets just the right mood , and the early career appearance of Richard Kiel as a hulking strong man is good for curiosity value . It's true that the theatrical trailer actually gives away too much of the films ' content , but let me also say that one shouldn't read the summary on the back of the DVD case either , as it gives away the movies ' biggest secret . A really rather pleasant and satisfying little movie , it's mildly spooky but not unbearably so , making it a decent option for family viewing .
An entertaining little B sci-fi flick .	Bizarre , trippy , forget - about - a - story - and - full - steam - ahead low budget sci-fi about the Williams family , living in the California desert . They become witness to a series of events that escalate in their level of strangeness ; apparently , they've been caught in a time-space warp , where past , present and future collide . This is the excuse for a parade of highly amusing special effects - a constant light and sound show , dinosaur-like creatures that have at each other , a friendly and tiny little E . T . who enchants the granddaughter , and so on . This picture does show off a little imagination , if nothing else . Very nice music by Richard Band , engaging special effects work from the likes of David Allen , Randall William Cook , and Peter Kuran , and , importantly , a likable family are key assets . It generates a sense of child-like amazement ; it may very well be that it's more of a romp for kids ( or the kids inside many of us ) who are able to gloss over any flaws in the narrative or presentation . I found it hard to resist ; it's a short and sweet ( 80 minutes ) diversion , and a decent credit for director John " Bud " Cardos ( of " Kingdom of the Spiders " fame ) and executive producer Charles Band .
Some great character actors bring it to life .	A fanatical cult led by Grace Spivey ( Grace Zabriskie ) comes to believe that little kid Joey Scavello ( Jarrett Lennon ) is the Antichrist in disguise , and set about to wipe the poor boy off the face of the Earth . Joey and mom Christine ( an awful Belinda Bauer ) take it on the lam with heroic , nice-guy private detective Charlie Harrison ( Bruce Greenwood ) . While not distinguished enough to make it particularly GOOD or MEMORABLE , I was pleasantly surprised that I was able to become emotionally invested in the material . Lennon is appropriately vulnerable , and not overbearingly cute or precocious , to allow for sufficient sympathy for his character . Greenwood is a capable lead , showing off some real acting chops in some scenes . What made me want to seek it out was the presence of some fairly prolific , and under-rated ( at least by Hollywood ) actors : the luminous Zabriskie , who creates an interesting and oddly compelling villain ( although as the film goes on the viewer is forced to ponder the idea that she may not actually BE the true villain of the piece ) , the uniquely featured European giant Carel Struycken ( some of you may recognize him as " Lurch " from the " Addams Family " movies of the 1990's ) , and old pros Richard Bradford and Jack Kehoe ( both of whom , interestingly , were also in 1987's " The Untouchables " ) . I have not read the Dean R . Koontz novel , although I may do so someday . Therefore , I can't tell you how good an adaptation this is ( although it seems to be that many Koontz adaptations have not worked out ) , but it's a fairly entertaining and chilling - not to mention downright unpleasant at times - little picture . It's okay , just nothing special . The actors - excepting Bauer , who's stiff and thoroughly unconvincing all through the picture - are the main attraction . ( Look for retired military man turned technical adviser / character actor Dale Dye in a pit part as a policeman . ) Overall , it works fairly well , although it would probably appeal more to undiscriminating genre completists - or Koontz fans who would like to catch all of his film adaptations .
" Your mother mates out of season "	Three years ago , a race of humanoid aliens genetically designed to function as slave labor came to Earth , where they were allowed to stay and make their new home . Despite the arms-wide-open welcome of Earth's leaders , this leads to a new form of bigotry : many humans secretly hate the " Newcomers " ( as they come to be known ) , referring to them as ' slags ' behind their backs . Detective Matthew Sykes ( James Caan ) loses his partner Tug ( Roger Aaron Brown ) in a bloody shootout with some Newcomer criminals . Determined to solve the crime , he decides , despite his own prejudices , to team up with a Newcomer who's just been given the historic distinction of being the first alien to make the rank of detective . He hopes that his partner's insight - and inside track - will give him the advantage he needs . Mandy Patinkin definitely steals the show , as the easygoing Newcomer detective " Sam Francisco " ( Earthlings took it upon themselves to give the Newcomers human names ) . Caan's role is pure cliché , but he plays it with some charm , likability , and humor , saving the role from being one-dimensional . Intense veteran Terence Stamp plays a prominent Newcomer named William Harcourt , who has taken on some all too human traits , and turns out to be involved in the movie's plot ( refreshingly , the conspiracy is not too complicated ) . The film itself is paced well , with a welcome sense of humor . The makeup design is impressive ( behind the scenes , the Newcomers were jokingly referred to as potato heads ) , and the cast above-average , although all the action scenes seem rather perfunctory . The major appeal lies in the chemistry between Caan and Patinkin , who become genuinely entertaining as a team . The aspects of the Newcomers include their fondness for sour milk ( it's to them what liquor would be to us ) and their fatal vulnerability to salt water . " Alien Nation " ultimately became a franchise of sorts , leading to a TV series and a slew of made-for-TV movies . It's slick , enjoyable , and amusing , not to mention short-and-sweet ( it's only an hour and a half long ) . I liked it and I believe that if you're a fan of Caan and / or Patinkin , then you really should catch it at least once .
Not Bad .	A medieval tale that closes with AC / DC's " You Shook Me All Night Long ? " Surely you jest ! Peasant squire William Thatcher ( Heath Ledger ) pretends to be of noble birth so he can compete in jousting and sword-fighting tournaments . He makes an enemy in the vain Count Adhemar ( Rufus Sewell ) , and falls in love with the saintly Jocelyn ( Shannyn Sossamon ) . Funny thing , this movie : it starts out as thoroughly goofy , as the action is often underscored by rock songs of the past few decades . Then , in the second half , it gets dramatic on me , as it then attempts to treat the characters and the story seriously ! I'm not saying I didn't enjoy this ; it's fun ( to a degree ) and likeable , with an enjoyable cast , but those changes in tone are jarring . The movie should have been more consistent and gone one way or the other , and not tried to have it both ways . Worth watching if you're a Heath Ledger fan , in any event . I gave it .
Funny stuff . That's the bottom line .	Comedian / former sitcom star Jerry Seinfeld's filmed farewell performance of the material that he had been using for years in his act , touching on such subjects as old people , supermarkets , men and women , airplane travel , etcetera . This HBO special opens with a comedy bit , a funeral , featuring several of Seinfeld's comedy contemporaries , mourning the " death " of his much-loved jokes . Not always terribly funny , but that's only because of its familiarity . Whatever the case , Seinfeld is a consummate professional who has obviously perfected his timing and delivery over his many years as a stand-up comic and he still has what it takes to make his old jokes work . Of course , this special has to be actually SEEN to be appreciated due to Seinfeld's often hilarious expressions and mannerisms . I enjoyed watching " I'm Telling You for the Last Time " .
Not bad slasher opus with memorable bad-taste gags .	A group of friends make a new acquaintance in Julie ( Tisa Farrow ) while vacationing in Greece ; as they travel by boat , she convinces them to make a stopover on an island where she's supposed to meet some friends . But when they get there , the local town is deserted , and there are no real clues as to what happened . When night falls , they will start falling victim to the depraved monster responsible . I'll get some of my minor beefs out of the way so I can get to the good stuff . It drags in some places , although the build-up of suspense that would have been created by director Joe D'Amato is largely diminished by a music score that most of the time is just plain bad . That said , this movie doesn't make a tired old plot seem fresh and new , but what it does do is create a real sense of mystery and foreboding . The deserted island truly does look intimidating . The exotic locale is most welcome ; the scenery and location work are impressive and it's all very well photographed by Enrico Biribicchi . Characters are reasonably likable ; however , it's George Eastman , definitely very creepy here , that comes off the best as the hulking killer . What really makes this movie are the outrageous scenes - one in particular is very memorable - taking place near the end , which I dare not spoil for those yet to see this . Gore fans are bound to get a real kick out of these . This foray into horror for the late prolific sleaze director D'Amato is overall a worthy viewing for die-hard fans of the genre . Suffice it to say , it definitely has its moments .
Decent religious horror thriller .	Robert Thorn ( screen legend Gregory Peck ) is the US Ambassador to England and on the night that his wife Katherine ( Lee Remick ) loses their baby , he is convinced to " adopt " an infant on the spot . By the time the child has reached the age of five , those closest to the kid realize there is something wrong with him and Robert investigates the kid's origins with photographer Jennings ( David Warner ) . The movie carefully moves along , with a controlled performance by the always dignified Peck . It features some memorable murder set-pieces ( not showing more blood than is necessary , however ) , particularly the decapitation , which you have to see to believe . Sometimes fairly creepy - the best sequence is the night-time one set in the old graveyard with the devil dogs milling about . The story is interesting enough but those of you who can guess the plot developments and outcome early on may be impatient by the film's slow pace . Not that scary but it IS competently made , with climax that starts out suspenseful and ends up harrowing . Good supporting performances by Warner and Billie Whitelaw , too . To date , this movie has been followed by three sequels , the last made for television .
Pretty good as revenge tales go .	Eddie Marino ( Robert Forster ) is a blue-collar guy who learns that his friends and co - workers have turned vigilante to punish criminal scum . Eddie's always believed in the system , but when his son is murdered and his wife assaulted , and the vermin responsible are inadequately punished , his mind is changed . " Vigilante " is an enjoyable low-budget variation on " Death Wish " , a grim and gritty follow - up by director William Lustig to his disturbing horror picture " Maniac " . It gets a lot out of its NYC locales , and is fast , slick , and knows how to push people's buttons . The violence is every bit as ugly as it needs to be , and there are brief doses of bare skin : one hooker bares her breasts , and there's also some rear male nudity ! The music by Jay Chattaway is truly superb , and the Panavision cinematography by James Lemmo gives the film a great look . The fine cast gives this B picture extra appeal . Forster is low-key and believable as the average guy turned reluctant vigilante , and Fred Williamson is as always a cool , charismatic bad-beep as Nick , the friend leading the group of vigilantes . Richard Bright , Joseph Carberry , Rutanya Alda , Don Blakely , salsa star Willie Colon , Carol Lynley , Steve James , and Frank Pesce co-star . Woody Strode , who still looked quite imposing at almost seventy years of age , and " Maniac " star Joe Spinell have particularly entertaining cameo roles . " Vigilante " is truly a picture that pulls few punches . Some viewers may even be surprised at where Lustig and crew go in the service of the story , but it can't be denied that it will really hit a nerve . " Vigilante " offers enjoyably sordid thrills for a well-paced 90 minutes of nasty exploitation fare .
Not everything it could have been , but a fairly decent entry in the series .	Gorgeous Kate Hodge and likable William Butler play Michelle and Ryan , traveling through Texas who get waylaid by the ever-changing family of deranged chainsaw-wielding cannibals . They do have one thing on their side : almost literally running into survivalist Benny ( Ken Foree , oozing bad ass cool as always ) , he proves to be a very helpful ally . This entry in the series is just sadistic and bloody enough ( at least in unrated form ) to satisfy horror fans . Director Jeff Burr , working from a script by " splatterpunk " author David J . Schow , keeps the story progressing at a steady pace . The movie is fairly lively , amusing , and has some good set pieces going for it . The KNB effects crew does create some decent gore , the sets and locations are quite appropriate , and the cast certainly gives it their all . It's quite cool to see a dues-paying Viggo Mortensen , over a decade before the " Lord of the Rings " series brought him to true prominence , as studly family member Tex who switches from affability to madness very easily . Joe Unger is a real hoot as the handicapped Tinker , Miriam Byrd-Nethery ( who'd been in Burr's horror anthology " The Offspring " ) a delight as Mama , who speaks through a voice box , and Jennifer Banko as a cute / creepy blonde moppet . R . A . Milhailoff won't make you forget Gunnar Hansen anytime soon , but does reasonably well as the latest Leatherface . Stealing every one of his scenes is Tom Everett as Alfredo , a crazed pervert and comedy relief character in the tradition of The Hitch-hiker and Chop Top . He mugs it up to the nth degree , and is just downright priceless . In fact , the antagonists here are more engaging characters than their victims , with the exception of Benny , played by Foree with all the cool he can muster . Unfortunately , it just doesn't have as much punch as it could have had due to the struggles the film-makers had with the MPAA , and the ensuing changes made . As it stands , it's a enjoyable flick but may leave some viewers wanting even a little bit more .
I like it and I'm not just saying that as a Winnipegger !	Toula ( Nia Vardalos ) is a thirty year old " seating hostess " at her father's Greek restaurant who decides to break against family tradition for once in her life - she gets a college education , gives herself a makeover , and goes to work at her aunt's travel bureau . She also chances to meet Ian ( John Corbett ) a good-looking schoolteacher and they fall in love . Her family is less than thrilled at the prospect of Toula marrying a non-Greek so Ian has to work at being accepted by this very traditional family . " My Big Fat Greek Wedding " is a modest little movie - there are no real fireworks here ( I don't see what all the fuss is about , really ; I think it's good but it's not that GREAT ) but is perfectly acceptable , likable entertainment . It's pretty lightweight , and not dependent on plot . The laughs come from the writer / star's one liners , gently poking fun at her own heritage , as well as some decent performances ( Louis Mandylor and Nsync's Joey Fatone are pretty funny ) . I will say this , though - Ian , as performed by Corbett , is a little bland - even mildly obnoxious at first - and it's hard to imagine how any woman could just fall head over heels for him in a short span of time . I mean , he just doesn't seem like a great catch to me . ( Ian Gomez , Vardalos ' real-life husband , plays the supporting role of Mike . ) I got to laugh at the idea of anybody thinking any medical problem could be solved with Windex ! Followed by a TV series that understandably didn't last very long .
Not bad B horror from 20th Century Fox .	Dr . Larry Forbes ( Shepperd Strudwick , billed as John Shepperd ) travels to France to be with his bride-to-be , Madelon ( gorgeous Lynne Roberts ) . Madelons ' uncle is the title character , an esteemed scientist played by George Zucco , who played his fair share of these types of roles in his time . J . Carrol Naish is the strange Noel , supposedly Renaults ' handyman , but really his experiment and crowning achievement : a former gorilla Renault has , Dr . Moreau style , turned into a humanoid being . The fact that a major studio was behind this one gives it a little extra style . Better than usual production values ( the movie certainly looks good ) and the quality of the cast is undeniable . Granted , it's a little light on the horror elements , playing more like a mystery until ( rather late in the movie ) the secret of the title is revealed . But it does just fine as a modest programmer . Naish fares best in a sympathetic performance as a " monster " who would rather have remained as his former incarnation . Zucco is also fun , with solid supporting work by Eugene Borden , Jean Del Val , Charles La Torre , tough guy veteran Mike Mazurki , Jack Norton , Bert Roach , and Arthur Shields . The movie does a decent enough job of exploring the idea that the true nature of man or animal may be impossible to avoid . This applies to both Noel and Rogell , the Mazurki character . A very short ( running 58 minutes ) movie designed to play double bills , " Dr . Renault's Secret " is an enjoyable B picture from a studio not exactly known for B horror . It might not compare to some of the Universal output from the 30's and 40's , but it's just fine of its kind . It's based on a novel titled " Balaoo " by Gaston Leroux , best known for a much more famous work , " The Phantom of the Opera " .
Something to check out if you're tired of slasher films .	Bookstore employee Virginia ( Jenny Wright ) reads a sick if oddly poetic horror story by an author named Malcolm Brand and in so doing resurrects the demented creep , who kills off real people in the same fashion as those in his book . Virginia has a tough time convincing anybody , starting with her detective boyfriend Richard ( Clayton Rohner ) , that she's not just some fruitcake and that her information actually has merit . Genuinely interesting and rather imaginative terror film that could possibly satisfy both the audiences that desire creative writing and those who crave blood ( even if the blood in this movie doesn't exactly look real ) . Well acted by Wright and Rohner , with some unfamiliar but competent players in the supporting cast , and featuring decent effects work and gore . Effects expert Randall William Cook himself plays the part of Brand and does a creditable job . Overall , " I , Madman " ( named " Hardcover " in the theatrical trailer ) is a reasonably impressive piece of work that I would recommend that others seek out . For once , this is a movie that doesn't show the gore merely for shock value but incorporates it as a necessary element to show the madness of the villain . Written by David Chaskin , whose credits also include the first " Nightmare on Elm Street " sequel .
Another highly original piece of work from Larry Cohen .	Deeply religious police detective Peter Nicholas ( Tony Lo Bianco ) investigates bizarre incidents in which seemingly normal people embark on violent rampages , after which they always make the same dying confession of " God told me to " . The investigation leads Nicholas on an increasingly odd journey , not only towards probing the mystery , but learning something about himself . Similar to Alfred Soles ' much-acclaimed shocker " Alice , Sweet Alice " in its heavy accent on Catholic imagery , I can certainly say that any Larry Cohen film is going to be an entertaining , intriguing , thought-provoking film no matter what its flaws may be . I haven't seen anything quite like " God Told Me To " , and don't expect I will again . Not limiting itself to any one genre , whether it be cop drama , science-fiction , or thriller , the film maintains a suitably ominous mood , helped considerably by Frank Cordell's eerie music . The excellent cast was a big asset , with Sandy Dennis and Sylvia Sidney contributing standout moments , although Lo Bianco does a respectable job in the lead . Other familiar faces like Mike Kellin , Richard Lynch ( whose two scenes are a fantastic study in stylish , surreal strangeness ) , Deborah Raffin , Al Fann , and Cohen film regular James Dixon can be seen , with the late , enigmatic , eccentric comedian Andy Kaufman in a rare dramatic turn as an NYC cop . I definitely enjoy this film , and I can genuinely say that I won't be likely to forget it . Worth catching , not just for a Cohen fan like myself , but anyone looking for something very atmospheric ( Cohen once again infuses a movie with great NYC flavor ) and strikingly offbeat .
Not Until The Fat Lady Sings !	Earth comes under attack by EXTREMELY hostile aliens who hover enormous spaceships over Earth's major cities and reduce them to rubble . The fate of mankind ends up resting in the hands of a diverse group of people : a pilot ( Will Smith ) , a computer genius ( Jeff Goldblum ) and none other than the President of the United States ( Bill Pullman ) . Some people may attack this movie and accuse it of being relentlessly stupid , to which I say LIGHTEN UP . Don't you know that if we all took every movie ever made seriously , we may end up hating most of them ? That's what I do . I don't take this kind of entertainment seriously . It is very entertaining , very long but very entertaining . It has truly remarkable special-effects sequences and a very interesting cast . It may be more drawn-out than it needs to be , but overall I think it's cool . I am probably more impressed by the sheer spectacle of the film than anything else , though . I rate the movie .
Smart , amusing and fun : a great 80's genre movie .	A comet is passing Earth and the entire population is getting ready for the big show . However , the next morning brings devastating results : everybody who was outside has turned to dust , those who were briefly exposed are metamorphosing into zombies , and it seems as if two teenagers , level-headed Regina ( Catherine Mary Stewart ) and spunky Samantha ( Kelli Maroney ) are the only ones unaffected . Soon , however , they meet handsome stranger Hector ( Robert Beltran ) and are contacted by military scientists including Carter ( Geoffrey Lewis ) and Audrey ( Mary Woronov ) . First things first : I was impressed with the visual style of the film : the red tint to the frame ( even the dusty remains of the many victims are red ) is very arresting . Second , writer / director Thom Eberhardt and crew are to be commended for creating a great vision of an abandoned and forlorn looking L . A . Eberhardts ' script is a nice amalgam of ideas - zombies , an end-of-the-world story , and a satire on the lifestyles of kids in the 80's , infused with humor ( confronted with a zombie kid , Beltran quips " You're lucky I like kids ! " and " There goes the neighborhood ! " ) . Eberhardt moves the story along very well , although the climax is more low-key than one might expect . The gorgeous Stewart and the cute Maroney have the right amount of appeal in the leads , and I thought it good that neither of them was presented as a one-dimensional caricature . Beltran is likable in the male lead , and Michael Bowen is funny in his brief time on screen . Veterans Lewis and Woronov play their roles so well that when a twist as to the motives of each of their characters is revealed , it's genuinely unexpected and thus highly welcome . There's not very much in the way of violence , effects , or action ( or scares , save for two nightmare sequences ) , but it's witty , clever , and rather original , and , in the end , fun to watch . The strong 1980's flavor really permeates it , including wardrobes and the bountiful amount of cheesy pop and rock songs . That decade may be technically long gone now , but it definitely lives on in films like this . I had a very good time watching this .
1 , 2 , Freddy's Coming For You . . .	A quartet of teenagers ( Heather Langenkamp , Amanda Wyss , Nick Corri , Johnny Depp ) are all having the same nightmare , in which they are pursued by undead being Freddy Krueger ( Robert Englund ) , a child murderer executed years ago by a vengeful mob . It's up to Nancy ( Langenkamp ) to figure out how to combat this sadistic fiend . A genuinely scary and imaginative horror movie with a good premise , this is so much more than just a standard slasher story . It's spectacularly gory - needlessly so , I think , but its effectiveness remains intact . Freddy is an authentically creepy villain , played to the hilt by Englund , who became a horror movie icon after assuming the role . This remains one of writer / director Wes Craven's definitive works ; the only thing that really works against it is the ending which many people have deemed too silly ; I've heard that the studio , sensing the potential franchise opportunities , insisted that it be filmed against Craven's wishes . Depp's feature film debut ; years later , when he'd become a star thanks to the TV series ' 21 Jump Street ' , he made a cameo appearance in " Freddy's Dead " .
A great crime drama with a typically fine Al Pacino performance .	Pacino plays Carlito Brigante , a former criminal who gets out of prison after a five year stretch . He's vowed to go straight , and hooks up with old flame Gail ( Penelope Ann Miller ) while enjoying a new gig as the boss of a night club . However , his loyalty to his hopelessly corrupt attorney Dave Kleinfeld ( an excellent Sean Penn ) proves to be unwise . In addition , he finds that the code of honor that he lives by no longer counts for much in a world that's changed from the one he's used to . Even at two hours and 24 minutes , this gritty , downbeat , and ultimately very poignant crime drama is compelling every step of the way . The violence is in the service of the story instead of the other way around , which makes it all the more effective . Director Brian De Palma also does a fine job of immersing us in the environment . The mid-70's period is strongly and amusingly evoked using many of the popular songs from the period . Most importantly , Pacino creates a character that comes off as genuine , honorable , and one that a viewer can root for even as his situation begins spiraling out of control . Carlito may be out of touch and retain values that most other characters seem to reject , but that's just what makes him such a strong character , as he tries to distance himself from the corruption going on around him . The pace never flags ; rather , it moves very well from scene to scene with the kind of dialog where one is compelled to hear every word . It's overall remarkably affecting , eventually escalating into a heart-pumping climax where Carlito is running for his life . Penn does a tremendous job in the role of Kleinfeld ; along with the slightly different look he sports here , he truly becomes this shameless pile of slime , just as crooked if not more than the criminals that he represents . Miller is very endearing in what is far and away one of the most interesting parts that she's ever had . John Leguizamo , as the cocky young upstart Benny Blanco , Luis Guzman , as the increasingly dissatisfied associate Pachanga , Viggo Mortensen , in a heartfelt cameo as a pathetic , wheelchair-bound would-be rat , and James Rebhorn , as the uptight and hard-driving district attorney , comprise a solid supporting cast . Other performers in small parts include Richard Foronjy , Adrian Pasdar , Al Israel , Rick Aviles , film director Paul Mazursky ( in a cool cameo as a judge in the opening minutes ) , Jon Seda , John Finn , and Vincent Pastore . Marc Anthony performs with the Latin band at the disco . This film is a fine achievement for both the director and star . It's riveting all the way through .
Ideal no-brainer action vehicle for Chuck Norris .	The veteran action star is Col . Braddock , a former prisoner of war who goes back to Vietnam and is determined to bring back the American soldiers that the Vietnamese government denies are still being held there . " Missing in Action " is all business . Director Joseph Zito knows just what the audience demands , and delivers it in large doses . While there is of course a serious theme behind the mayhem , it never gets in the way of the comic book style violence and thrills . Zito maintains a brisk pace , and creates a generous assortment of villains heinous enough for us to loudly cheer their demise . There's plenty of gunfire and explosions to keep it lively , some impressive Philippines scenery , and rousing music by Jay Chattaway . A standout sequence has Norris slowly emerging from water to mow down the bad guys just when they think he might be done for . It all heads straight for an exciting climax and feel-good conclusion . Norris is well supported by the superior character actors M . Emmet Walsh , who supplies a broad amount of humor as the comedy relief sidekick , and James Hong , as the Vietnamese colonel who knows more than he's letting on ( although he disappears from the film a little too soon ) . Ernie Ortega is also malevolent fun as the nasty-looking heavy Vinh . " Missing in Action " is thoroughly engaging escapist fare . It ought to leave a smile on the face of many an action fan . Trivia note : Jean-Claude Van Damme is credited as a stunt man ! Zito and Norris would re-team for " Invasion U . S . A . " the following year .
Since Nightbeast technically is active in the daytime . . .	. . . They could have called him 24-Hour-Beast , but that wouldn't exactly roll off the tongue , would it ? My first film from Do-It-Yourself regional film-maker Don Dohler is a standard " unfriendly alien comes to Earth and tears up the locals " B plot . And of course someone has to try to stop our ugly marauder . It's up to low-key folksy sheriff Cinder ( Tom Griffith , who looks like a frizzy-haired low-rent version of Burt Reynolds ) and his hottie deputy Lisa ( Karin Kardian ) to attempt to pull it off , with the help of assorted locals . This film is so cheesy one's going to need something with which to wash down the cheese . I imagine beer would be a good choice . It's cool that Dohler clearly has the same affection for B genre pictures that many of us have . His film may not have the spit and polish of Hollywood products , but it also has the heart that some of them lack . It's inevitable that the audience for such a film - myself included - will need to be the type of viewers that enjoy both the kind of films that " Nightbeast " pays tribute to as well as the kind of films that succeed no matter lacking they may be technically . All in all , I found it highly enjoyable . It hits the ground running and puts on a good show , all things considered . Not many films of this kind will take time out - a fair amount of time - to establish a budding romance between Cinder and Lisa ( it took a crisis for him to realize how delectable she is ) , as well as a brawl between two characters after someone in the movie is killed by someone other than Nightbeast , and an actual shootout between the alien and the cops ! The special effects and gore are great fun in all their low-tech glory , the acting is pretty much underwhelming across the board , Kardian and Monica Neff as Suzie bare their lovely bodies , and it delivers enough good laughs to qualify as a good time . I'm now going to look forward to watching other Dohler ventures such as " The Alien Factor " and " Fiend " .
Lots of laughs in great 1983 Steve Martin film .	Steve Martin plays brilliant brain surgeon Dr . Michael Hfuhruhurr ( when he says it , it sounds like Huh-FURRRR ) , renowned for his " screw top " method . He makes the mistake of falling for self-serving , vampish Dolores Benedict ( Kathleen Turner ) , but finds reason to live when he falls even harder for disembodied brain Anne Uumellmahaye ( voice of Sissy Spacek ) , and he decides to find a gorgeous woman in which to house Anne . Made back in the day when Martin was still more or less the " wild and crazy guy " and his starring vehicles were pretty silly , " The Man with Two Brains " , kind of a spoof of mad scientist movies , is absolutely HILARIOUS at times . I was pleasantly surprised to find myself laughing so much . Martin once again establishes himself as a top comedic talent , and is well supported by Turner , playing a comedic variation on her " Body Heat " role , and David Warner , playing a wacko doctor who provides Hfuhruhurr with the means to realize his dream . Familiar faces like James Cromwell and Paul Benedict can be seen in small roles . One of the most inspired touches in the film has to be the identity of the Elevator Killer , although the running joke of Warner's condo having walls as thin as tissue paper is amusing ( although it stops just short of being beat to death ) . A very funny comedy , and I would advise any Steve Martin fan who has yet to see it to check it out . This is one of his best . Written by Martin , director Carl Reiner ( Martin's frequent collaborator in the late 70's and early 80's ) , and George Gipe .
A fun and engaging Bigfoot picture .	College students Pahoo ( Dennis Fimple ) and Rives ( John David Carson ) travel to the Louisiana swamps to locate trapper Joe Canton ( Jack Elam ) , who's made a claim that a " creature " killed his partner . They're eager to prove the existence of Bigfoot , and see this as their chance . Written by Jim McCullough Jr . ( who also co-stars as the friendly Orville and sings a nice little ditty quite pleasantly ) and produced by him and his father , the film is nicely directed by Joy N . Houck , Jr . It immerses the characters and the viewer ( s ) deeply in a palpable rural atmosphere . It's as much a slice of Southern life as it is a creature feature , and it works on both counts . It slowly sets us up for the climax which proves to be a harrowing , suspenseful , and action-packed experience . Houck and company go with conventional wisdom here and tantalize us by giving little glimpses of the creature until the time is right to show it in all its hairy glory . Until then , Pahoo and Rives interact with locals ( including Orville and his grandfather ( the always delightful Dub Taylor ) , a sassy and sexy waitress ( played by Catherine McClenny , sister of Morgan Fairchild ) , two cute local girls , and finally eccentric loner Canton . Elam is very amusing as usual and his monologue at about the one hour mark is quite entertaining . Bill Thurman also turns up to give a solid performance as a sheriff who doesn't like to hear talk about " creatures " but isn't really the one-dimensional , hostile xenophobe that this type of character is so often portrayed as on film . Fimple and Carson make for a likable pair of naive protagonists , displaying an easygoing chemistry . It has both a fine look ( it's an early credit for top cinematographer Dean Cundey ) and feel . Jaime Mendoza Navas ' wonderful music is fine icing on this cake , adding just the right touch at all times . " Creature from Black Lake " is a good little horror film , with plenty going for it .
Good movie !	" Monster " is a fictionalization of the true story of Aileen " Lee " Wuornos ( Charlize Theron ) , a prostitute who killed her johns and stole their money . Lee tries to forge a " normal " life for herself and her partner Selby ( Christina Ricci ) but finds there is really no chance for her to do so . The real Wuornos was executed in 2002 after spending a dozen years on death row in Florida , and there is a pair of documentaries from Nick Broomfield featuring interviews with the convicted killer that may be worth checking out . I don't know how true to life this is ; it is a fictionalization , to be sure , but I do know that writer / director Patty Jenkins and star / co-producer Theron did do their homework on the material , including talking with a woman who had been a pen pal of Wuornos ' . It's actually more of a tragic , unconventional love story than anything else , and a carefully observed portrait of an emotionally ruined young woman who , according to this film anyway , never had a chance in life at all . Theron is very impressive in an Oscar-winning performance as the foul-mouthed and world-weary Lee ; it's a great job of total immersion in a role ( helped , also , by a good makeup job ) . Ricci does a respectable job , too ; it's one of her better performances . " Monster " is a fine debut film for Jenkins and I hope a sign of good things to come from her . When all is said and done , however , Theron's performance is more memorable than the film itself .
" Yuck ! And I thought my zits were bad ! "	This endearing micro-budget NYC-shot trash flick is about art student Alex ( Robert Sabin ) who moves into a cheap but decent enough new apartment , where he's surrounded by eccentric yet solicitous folk . After a meal of " Tibetan yogurt " , a drink of " elixir " , and a sexual encounter with a neighbor named Nicole , he becomes possessed by the spirit of an alchemist named Zachary who along with his followers committed suicide many years ago . This also causes him to turn into a humanoid pulpy mass that must go out and kill . Will his sweet girlfriend Lori ( leggy and pretty Mary Huner , who also pulls double duty by playing the role of the seductive Nicole ) be able to save him ? " Slime City " ultimately really lives up to its name . While it does actually have a bit of a build-up , it establishes its lead characters as reasonably likable and has the kind of infectious , just-go-for-it spirit often found in the do-it-yourself variety of low-budget genre film-making . It gets better ( so to speak ) and better as it goes along and won me over with its unrestrained tackiness . The deliciously ooey and gooey and extremely colorful makeup effects are quite impressive ; the film-makers clearly delighted in making this as disgusting as possible . The climax is the absolute best part , and worth the wait . One show-stopping moment involves evisceration ; you'll know it when you see it . This picture is a decent 82 minutes of good-natured gruesomeness .
A career highlight for Brian De Palma .	Psychotic transsexual Bobbi murders the patient ( Angie Dickinson ) of a prominent doctor ( Michael Caine ) and then pursues the high-priced prostitute ( Nancy Allen ) who caught a glimpse of Bobbi in the elevator . Liz ( Allen ) comes under suspicion of the crime and teams up with the patient's son ( Keith Gordon ) to catch the killer . It can be summed up in a couple of words : it's very sexy ( Dickinson and Allen look great ) , it's very bloody - with the kind of gore usually reserved for splatter movies , and boy is it well crafted . Writer / director De Palma's script is OK but it really takes a backseat to the man's film-making abilities . It is highly successful on a visceral level and I actually get involved / interested with these characters . I can notice the standard De Palma homages to / ripoffs of Hitchcock - at least from one of the Master's pictures . And to top it all off , it has a professional and believable cast . This was De Palma's third movie with ex-wife Nancy Allen ( after " Carrie " and " Home Movies " . ) By the way , dancer-turned-actress Rachel Ticotin was one of the production assistants . There's a bit of trivia for you . I wouldn't think a thriller could be classy and bloody at the same time but this picture pulls it off . One of the best things about it is a typically striking Pino Donaggio music score .
Unimaginative yet entertaining action movie .	Buddy-cop movie in which one of the buddies is actually a public defender , Roland Dalton ( Peter Weller ) who is friends with streetwise undercover detective Richie Marks ( Sam Elliott ) . Roland is defending Michael Jones ( Richard Brooks ) , a drug dealer who has killed a detective but who may have done it in self-defense . This leads to a joint effort between the two friends to take down a Mr . Big type drug kingpin ( Antonio Fargas ) and a clique of crooked cops . The writing in this movie is nothing we haven't seen before , but the movie is surprisingly watchable . The actors are good ( it's good to see Weller looking like he's having fun ) and likable and while the movie isn't full of non-stop action set pieces , the action scenes that we do see are very well-done ; the stunts and chases are impressive . Best of all , there is a sense of humor present that I really appreciate . There's a lot of familiar faces in the cast , including Thomas G . Waites , Shirley Stoler , John C . McGinley , Jude Ciccolella , Vondie Curtis-Hall , Kelly Rutherford , Paul Bartel , James Eckhouse , David Proval , John Finn , and Harold Perrineau , Jr . Personally , I think that it's a great little no-brainer and does just fine for a night's viewing . The romantic interludes between Weller and the two ladies that he is caught between ( D . A . Patricia Charbonneau and well-off fiancée Blanche Baker ) do slow things down a little bit , but they're not a chore to sit through , either . Basically , a pretty good film for the action crowd .
I liked it .	Nelson Moss ( Keanu Reeves ) is obsessed with his career ( he's in advertising - one of the most overused occupations in movies ) and he's kind of a cold fish . Sara Deever ( Charlize Theron ) sees this and makes him her latest " project " - she spends one month with a guy ( each guy actually has to move in with her ) and helps him to make positive changes . Not surprisingly , there turn out to be some complications this time . Sweet and simple romantic comedy / drama that doesn't seem to have any arty pretensions . It's just subtle , ( mostly ) believable stuff that would be hard to hate ( unless you can't stand this type of movie to begin with ) . It's certainly hard to hate any film with a cute dog - yes , I am vulnerable to that sort of manipulation . Theron is simply wonderful and Reeves is actually better than usual . The use of two standard genre clichés ( one of them is the Gay Best Friend , amusingly played by the always entertaining Jason Isaacs ) is kind of corny , though . Overall , though , I thought this was above-average for its genre and I gave it .
An incredible sight to behold .	" Lifeforce " is a truly bizarre adaptation of the novel " The Space Vampires " by Colin Wilson , scripted by Dan O'Bannon & Don Jakoby . A joint American-British space exploration team makes a mind-boggling discovery : an alien spacecraft resting inside Halleys ' Comet , containing three entities that look like people , one of them a female beauty ( the oh-so-alluring Mathilda May ) . They take these discoveries back on board their own spacecraft . Big mistake . It turns out that these creatures drain the life out of human beings , and as American colonel Carlsen ( an intense , edgy , and committed Steve Railsback ) and British S . A . S . colonel Caine ( a solid Peter Firth ) watch in horror , an infestation of vampirism overtakes London , with the fate of Earth in the balance . This picture certainly is not lacking in imagination . It moves a little slowly at times but offers so many strange and fanciful ideas and eye-popping visuals that it's hard not to be amused . The first of director Tobe Hoopers ' three-picture deal with Cannon Films ( he followed it up with " Texas Chainsaw Massacre II " and the " Invaders from Mars " remake ) , he makes it something truly unique . Incorporating elements of sci-fi , vampire films , zombie films , and end-of-the-world sagas , it's like nothing that I've seen before . Railsback and Firth are ably supported by such strong Brit actors as Frank Finlay , Patrick Stewart , Michael Gothard , Aubrey Morris , and John Hallam . Mathilda May is very memorable as the bewitching , enigmatic villainess ; it certainly doesn't hurt that she performs a great deal of her scenes in the nude . Also worth noting is a stirring music score from none other than " Pink Panther " composer Henry Mancini . Ridiculous it may be , but I found it to be fun as well . It's flamboyant and spirited entertainment .
Solid little crime drama .	Real-life tough guy Lawrence Tierney has one of the best parts of his acting career : notorious real-life criminal John Dillinger . This right-to-the-point little movie basically concentrates on his robbing and killing spree . Upon his original incarceration , Dillinger meets " Specs " Green ( Edmund Lowe ) and Greens ' small group of friends , and after he springs them out of jail , they embark on their crime spree , with the headstrong Dillinger ultimately figuring to take Greens ' place as leader of the gang . The cast is great in this efficiently paced and action-packed B flick . It runs a scant 70 minutes , with no filler , and is told in a real matter-of-fact style . Its suggestions of brutal violence ( such as Dillingers ' revenge on a waiter ) work just as well as any in-your-face bloodshed ever could . Tierney is ideal for the role of a ruthless criminal and is ably supported by Eduardo Ciannelli , Marc Lawrence , Elisha Cook , Jr . and beautiful Anne Jeffreys as his female companion . Dimitri Tiomkin supplies a typically excellent music score . " Dillinger " is an all-business , unsentimental , and enjoyably dark crime saga . It's entertaining from beginning to end .
I love it !	Teenager Charley Brewster ( William Ragsdale ) discovers that his new next-door neighbor Jerry Dandridge ( Chris Sarandon ) is a vampire and finds that now his life , and that of girlfriend Amy ( Amanda Bearse ) , are in danger ; in desperation , he turns to TV horror host Peter Vincent ( Roddy McDowall ) for help . " Fright Night " is great horror fun from the 1980's , with engaging performances by Ragsdale and Bearse ( however , Evil Ed ( Stephen Geoffreys ) gets to be a bit much ) ; Sarandon and McDowall are especially good . It's funny and somewhat scary , stylish , and seems to have a great respect for horror movies of the past . Special effects are also a highlight , with decent transformation / death scenes . It's fairly long for a horror film ( 1 Hour 47 Minutes ) but it is entertaining from beginning to end . Followed by the sequel " Fright Night Part II " ( re-uniting Ragsdale and McDowall ) four years later .
A great celebration of the macabre .	An enjoyable blend of dark humor and genuinely creepy and bizarre horror , " Spider Baby " is the story of the Merrye ( pronounced like the name Mary ) family , afflicted with an extremely rare disease that affects only their family . As they age physically , they regress mentally , while developing playfully sadistic traits . Loving and responsible chauffeur Bruno ( horror icon Lon Chaney , in a typically endearing performance ) fears the worst when several visitors drop by , seeing as how the " kids " - Ralph ( Sid Haig ) , Elizabeth ( Beverly Washburn ) , and Virginia ( Jill Banner ) have had little to no contact with the outside world . " Spider Baby " is a delightfully offbeat and twisted little picture with animated opening credits that let us know that we're going to be in for a good time . Chaney even does a great rendition of the catchy title song . The movie is a great melange of amusing comic bits and gloomy atmosphere . The house itself , a nice update of " haunted houses " from decades past , is a great location and perfectly conveys a sense of dreaded things to come , complete with a secret in the basement . Writer / director Jack Hill delivers it with conviction and panache ; his script has some entertaining lines ( there are references to older horror films , including , not surprisingly , the Wolf Man character that Chaney had so memorably portrayed on screen two decades ago ) and there's a gleefully ghoulish climax to the proceedings . It's all enhanced by the spooky score from the ever-reliable composer Ronald Stein . It kicks off with a brief cameo by Mantan Moreland ; while it might have been nice to see a little more of him , his graphic demise is a solid indicator of what to expect for the balance of the film . Carol Ohmart and Karl Schanzer ( the latter comes complete with a Hitler style mustache ! ) successfully delineate two unsubtly self-serving cretins who we hope will ultimately get theirs . Quinn Redeker is very amiable as the uncle who instead of getting freaked out by his newfound relatives merely goes with the flow . And Washburn , Banner , and Haig ( Haig , of course , being the true breakout star of this picture , who went on to work with writer / director Jack Hill in follow-up efforts like " The Big Doll House " , " Coffy " , and " Foxy Brown " ) dive headfirst into their juicy and off-putting roles with considerable relish . This solid little film serves up a great dose of merrily malicious horror hijinks . It's definitely worth checking out .
Here I Go Again ; I'm Obviously MUCH Too Easy To Please !	Interesting " Friday the 13th " entry has nothing connecting it to the last entry ( " Jason Takes Manhattan " ) . Instead , the opening has Jason pursuing a nubile young woman through the woods ; she turns out to be an FBI agent who lures Jason right into a trap - and his body is blown to smithereens in the ensuing ambush . HOWEVER ( of course , there has to be a " however " ) , this still doesn't mean that Jason is dead - the evil force that has animated Jason all these years is still very much alive and free to inhabit a succession of victims . This ninth " Friday the 13th " movie has some interesting story twists that were only then , after eight previous movies , being concocted . This is an energetic , emphatically violent , lively ( and very mean-spirited , unfortunately ) horror sequel with spectacular gore ( particularly in the unrated director's cut ) and performances that are actually something approaching decent . An entertaining way to spend an hour and a half . There are a few visual in-jokes that horror fans will instantly recognize . In addition to playing Jason , stuntman Kane Hodder also appears sans makeup as one of two FBI agents ( he's the big , bearded one ) guarding the morgue . Even if you don't enjoy it , you may want to stick around for the surprise in the very last scene . It will either make you groan or clap , depending on your disposition towards these kinds of movies .
Absorbing and gripping crime thriller .	James Woods gets a great role for his very electric personality : Eddie Dodd , an activist / radical back in the 60's who now makes his living as a defense attorney for reprehensible criminal scum . ( He makes drug dealers his specialty . ) Into his life comes modern idealist and law school graduate Roger Baron ( a wonderfully sincere Robert Downey , Jr . ) , who's been hired as his assistant . When Eddie is approached by a Korean woman named Mrs . Kim to defend her son Shu Kai ( Yuji Okumoto , whom you might recognize as Ralph Macchio's nemesis in " The Karate Kid Part II " ) , who's serving time in prison for a decade-old murder and who has since killed a racist pig attacker in self-defense , Roger goads him into taking the case , and Eddie finally once again discovers his own sense of morals and desire to fight injustice . The first filmed screenplay for Wesley Strick , who went on to write or co-write such films as " Arachnophobia " , the " Cape Fear " remake , and " Wolf " offers up a decent enough murder mystery that certainly does command one's attention , even if it's got familiar elements to it . The twists and turns are entertaining , and it's overall quite slick and efficiently paced by director Joseph Ruben ( " Dreamscape " , " The Stepfather " , " Sleeping with the Enemy " ) . It's not without some humor here and there ( watching Woods smoke a joint is quite funny ) and has some effective emotional highpoints as well . It does have its bleaker moments as well but works quite well in the end at creating redemption for some of its characters . Great NYC location work and Brad Fiedel's haunting music are significant assets . Woods's commanding presence definitely gives it something extra ; while Downey Jr . ' s character is played very straight and is less original and interesting , the two actors develop a good odd-couple sort of chemistry . Okumoto , Margaret Colin ( as the private investigator who works for Eddie ) , and Kurtwood Smith ( as the hard-nosed and contemptuous D . A . ) offer indelible support . A long lineup of familiar faces fill out the smaller parts very well , including Charles Hallahan , Tom Bower , Graham Beckel , Miguel Fernandes , Tony Haney , Luis Guzman , Joel Polis , Kurt Fuller , and Gerry Bamman . Without my giving too much away , it does bring up a good point in the end : the lengths that some people will go to to serve some sort of higher purpose . Sometimes , some good people or at least those innocent of whatever crimes they're accused of can get hurt or used along the way . Followed by a short lived TV series ( only six episodes made it to air ) with Treat Williams as Dodd .
A poignant mix of murder mystery and family drama .	A solid and worthwhile film about brothers Des and Tom Spellacy ( Robert De Niro and Robert Duvall ) , Des being a monsignor with the Catholic Church respected for his ability to make things happen , and Tom a volatile , edgy police detective . Tom starts investigating the case of a poor young girl hacked in two and left in a park ( this part of the story being inspired by the legendary real-life " Black Dahlia " murder case ) and uncovers many secrets along the way , among them the fact that it could have repercussions for the Church . Scripted by John Gregory Dunne and Joan Didion from Dunnes ' novel , it's a good story and well told , never wavering , and tying its story threads together for an interesting finish . It unavoidably exposes the seamy underbelly of the Los Angeles of the 1940's , complete with stag films and hookers and some unsavory characters . The period recreation is respectable , and the music by Georges Delerue is often beautifully haunting . On one level , it's a powerful and affecting story of many characters who are , if not completely irredeemable , at least morally compromised in some way . And on another , it's a wonderful story of two brothers ' devotion to each other over the years , no matter what their differences are . As could be expected , the two Roberts do very fine work . They also receive absolutely superior back-up from a phenomenal supporting cast including Kenneth McMillan ( in fine form as Duvalls ' cheerful , comedy relief partner ) , Charles Durning , Burgess Meredith , Ed Flanders , Rose Gregorio , and Cyril Cusack . Be sure to look for familiar faces in the smaller roles , including Pat Corley , Dan Hedaya , Jeanette Nolan , James Hong , and Louisa Moritz . I think it's a fine and overlooked movie with a wonderfully bittersweet ending that was very touching , and I came away from it very affected . I give it a strong recommendation .
" Money splits better two ways than three . "	In this , the third of five Westerns that he did with director Anthony Mann , cinema legend James Stewart is Howard Kemp , out to nab outlaw Ben Vandergroat ( Robert Ryan ) and bring him back to face the hangman . Kemp acquires two unlikely partners in unlucky old gold miner Jesse Tate ( Millard Mitchell ) and disgraced former Cavalry soldier Roy Anderson ( Ralph Meeker ) . Kemp finds himself attracted to Ben's spunky young female companion , Lina Patch ( Janet Leigh ) , while Ben , a very slick type , figures out how to push his captors ' buttons and set them against one another . What's effective about this tough , simple story is that the characters are flawed and not archetypes of good or evil . Even Stewart gets to show a different side by portraying a character motivated by an obsessive need to make some money and retain his dignity . The five actors play almost the only characters in the film ( save for a tribe of Blackfoot Indians whose wrath Roy has incurred ) so they each get a great opportunity to really show their stuff . The always solid Ryan and Meeker look like they're enjoying themselves immensely and that feeling is contagious . " The Naked Spur " captures the journey of these people across impressive landscapes . It was filmed in the Colorado Rockies and looks majestic as photographed by William Mellor . The music by Bronislau Kaper is the perfect accompaniment to these images . It's a good deal of fun to watch Ryan as he stirs things up . Meeker and Mitchell don't need much prodding to get in touch with their corrupt side , but in an especially effective scene Stewart realizes how he's let his baser instincts get the better of him and openly weeps . This comes during a tender moment between him and Leigh . The actors really make the most out of this script about human weakness and manipulation from Sam Rolfe and Harold Jack Bloom . At about 92 minutes in length , the film does not overstay its welcome but keeps things taut and interesting . It looks gorgeous in Technicolor and is overall quite a polished and engaging bit of film-making .
Another solid thriller from Brian De Palma .	Craig Wasson plays Jake Scully , a hapless struggling actor needing a place to stay . New acquaintance Sam Bouchard ( Gregg Henry ) sets him up with an amazing house-sitting gig , the primary attraction of which is the ability to peep on a sexy neighbor , Gloria Revelle ( Deborah Shelton ) , who performs a nightly routine in front of her window . As Jake continues to leer night after night , he ultimately witnesses Gloria being murdered , and decides to investigate the matter on his own . Brian De Palma strikes again with a typically stylish murder mystery / thriller , with a healthy nod to Hitchcock's " Vertigo " and " Rear Window " . It's an enjoyable exercise in pure sleaze , with plenty of sordid details . The plot also involves the hardcore porn genre , with Jake determined to interrogate one of its stars , Holly Body ( an appealing Melanie Griffith ) , whom Jake figures out was involved . The film uses the whole idea of the " body double " concept to craft a twist-laden story about illusion and deception , with apt commentary on the human capacity for voyeurism . It does an amusing and respectful job of paying tribute to both B level horror flicks ( Jake is starring in a tacky flick titled " Vampire's Kiss " ) and the porn industry . And it's a riveting bit of entertainment as well ( one whole sequence , featuring Frankie Goes to Hollywood's hit song " Relax " , is akin to a music video ) as well . De Palma gets great use out of his L . A . locations , and injects his film with a healthy dose of humor as well . Especially effective is the typically haunting music score by Pino Donaggio . The likable Wasson , the enjoyably smarmy Henry , and the enticing Griffith are well supported by Shelton as the sexy yet unhappy Gloria , Guy Boyd in a scene-stealing turn as the detective on the case , and Dennis Franz as a director he modeled after De Palma himself . Turning up in small parts are Barbara Crampton ( " Re-Animator " ) , Brinke Stevens , and Slavitza Jovan ( Gozer in " Ghost Busters " ) . " Body Double " is a good deal of sleazy and tongue-in-cheek fun .
Fun , breezy , landmark 1970's action film .	This quintessential drive-in classic from 1974 has a hotshot racer ( Peter Fonda ) and his trusted mechanic / sidekick ( Adam Roarke ) stage a daring supermarket robbery . Almost from the outset they acquire an unwanted companion in a one night stand of Fonda's ( Susan George ) who isn't about to be just blown off and quite simply attaches herself to them . They spend the balance of the picture evading a very determined lawman ( Vic Morrow ) , who tries to track them from a helicopter . This is made for anybody who loves their action loud and hard and their cars just as cool as can be . The film also takes the unconventional route of giving us anti-heroic , anti-authority troublemakers who aren't necessarily likable . The banter between Fonda and George flies back and forth , with him addressing her such endearing nicknames as " dingleberry " and " supercrotch " , with Roarke essentially playing the most low-key and level-headed of the three of them . Morrow's relentless cop isn't necessarily a good guy , either , and he's very intense in the role . The late , great Kenneth Tobey has a few scenes as Morrow's bureaucratic boss , and an oddly cast and uncredited Roddy McDowall does fine as the supermarket manager . " Dirty Mary Crazy Larry " is one of the more noteworthy examples of its genre , with the whole film basically adopting an anti-authoritarian , devil-may-care attitude . It's a lively affair with some good chases , in particular a harrowing showdown between a Dodge Charger and the helicopter . The film ends in one of the most daringly downbeat and abrupt final scenes one is likely to find in exploitation fare . It's quite memorable , and adds a real dramatic punctuation to the film . A must for any fan of 1970's drive-in pictures , and a career highlight for its Brit director , John Hough , also at the helm of one of the more interesting horror pictures of the 1970's , " The Legend of Hell House " , which incidentally also features Roddy McDowall .
The most fun I've had watching movies this week .	Off the wall drive in picture from the 1970's pairing a likable and animated David Carradine with spunky , sexy Kate Jackson of ' Charlie's Angels ' fame . After various assorted tangles with the henchmen working for her no-account father ( Roger C . Carmel ) , Carradine learns that her dear old dad has callously sent out hundreds of gallons of tainted rotgut guaranteed to make people sick . An incredibly humorous and lively film , this picture truly hits the ground running . It certainly did not give me many chances to breathe . The action and stunts are very well executed , and the jokes come fast and furious . It's almost a little too silly at times , kind of like a cartoon come to life , but it's all in good fun and the picture is hard not to like . Carradine and Jackson make for a good team , while their supporting cast does a hilarious job of hamming it up big time , especially Carmel , who takes top over-acting honors . Veteran talent Sterling Holloway ( who is automatically recognizable as the voice of Winnie the Pooh ) , Pat Cranshaw ( best known for playing Blue in " Old School " , and not really looking any younger here ) , Charles Napier ( who utters the film's most quotable line in a tussle with Carradine ) , Ron Feinberg ( recipient of a hilarious humiliation scene ) , George Murdock , Eddie Barth , and Claude ( Earl ) Jones round out the cast . Author Charles Willeford , whose novels were the basis for the movies " Cockfighter " , " Miami Blues " and " The Woman Chaser " , cameos as a bartender . Once the picture nears the one hour mark , it more or less turns into one long car chase , that's amazing for starting right up again just when you might think it's over . This is where the film gets truly exciting ; I have to say that it's one of the most entertaining car-crash action pictures that I've ever seen . Directed by former actor Corey Allen ( who was Buzz in " Rebel Without a Cause " ) , and produced by Roger Corman , with second unit direction by Lewis Teague , and an entertaining music score by Andy Stein . I recommend this one and say that it's definitely good for leaving interested viewers with a smile on their face . Another amusing highlight : a preacher who addresses his congregation while wrestling a gator !
I can see why Argento fans hold this in such high regard .	Well thought out but not too complex mystery from the masterful Italian film-maker about Marcus Daly ( David Hemmings ) , a jazz pianist and instructor who gets caught up in a succession of murders . At a conference on parapsychology , psychically gifted Helga Ulman ( Macha Meril ) picks up on the evil thoughts of an audience member , realizing that they've killed before and will kill again . And of course poor Helga gets murdered later that night . Marcus happens to live in the same building as Helga and more or less witnesses her murder . Together with a very spirited and kooky ( and aggressive ) reporter , Gianna Brezzi ( Daria Nicolodi , in her first association with Argento ) , he takes it upon himself to figure out what's going on . The writing is actually better than one might expect for this sort of thing , given that Argento's always stylish command of the medium of film most often takes precedence over such matters . Not that this isn't very stylish , of course . Argento has such a great eye for visuals that his film is always interesting to look at . Color schemes and camera-work inform the film throughout . Its murders are often quite flamboyant in a true Grand Guignol style , but also sometimes have an air of everyday reality to them , such as getting scalded by water or getting struck in the mouth . And while the murders in gialli and horror movies are often enough so garish as to be completely unidentifiable , the murders here really allow a viewer to wince in appropriate sympathy . The murder mystery is quite intriguing and the identity of the killer is one that some viewers may not see coming . Apparently , there are clues ( very subtle ones ) scattered throughout , but as I typically am not one who can pick up on those things , the ultimate reveal was certainly a good surprise . Argento collaborates with prog-rock group Goblin for the first time here ( they were suggested to him by Nicolodi after he was dissatisfied with original composer Giorgio Gaslini's work ) , and they truly give this genre something different with their hard-pounding score , which would influence such later composers as John Carpenter when he came up with the score for " Halloween " . The film is quite funny at times . An investigating detective with a rather sardonic attitude munches on a sandwich at a murder scene while interrogating Marcus , and Marcus and Gianna banter about sexual equality in a rather light-hearted tone , even going so far as to arm wrestle . Hemmings is engaging as the the inquisitive hero , bringing about echos of an earlier film and performance for him , in Antonioni's " Blow-Up " . Nicolodi is hilariously effervescent and Gabriele Lavia is likable as Marcus's friend Carlo . Child actress Nicoletta Elmi has a small role as a girl who provides Marcus with a major clue . This would mark the beginning of Nicolodi's association with Argento as she would become Argento's romantic partner ( bearing him his daughters Asia and Fiore ) , and frequent repertory player , appearing in " Inferno " , " Tenebrae " , " Phenomena " , and " Opera " , as well as co-writing " Suspiria " . Viewers looking to check out the giallo genre would do well to watch " Deep Red " as it's a highly effective and influential achievement .
" Death has come to your little town , sheriff . "	Made with real devotion by genuine fans of this ongoing horror movie series , " Halloween : 25 Years of Terror " arose out of the real-life 25th anniversary convention held in South Pasadena , and it's impressive to see such an assemblage of series participants , celebrity admirers ( running the gamut from Clive Barker to Rob Zombie to Edgar Wright ) , and dedicated super-fans . Engagingly narrated by the consistently appealing P . J . Soles , whom I don't need to tell anybody played Lynda in the original 1978 classic , this picture shows many things that die-hard fans could appreciate : memorabilia , convention footage , individual testimonials , and the like . It takes time to explore the genesis of the trend-setting first movie , examine its cultural impact and legacy , and give viewers details of the making of each series entry . Now , while I do love horror movies , I'm not an unconditional series fan myself . I actually kind of enjoy " Season of the Witch " , but agree that it should have really been removed from the franchise and been its own film ; it then might have had more of a chance for success . However , " Revenge " and " Curse " represented the bottom of the barrel for me . " H20 " was a mildly entertaining return to form , but " Resurrection " was too self-consciously trendy and completely lacking in scares and suspense . That said , I found this documentary informative and likable and was pleased to see so many actors from the series turn up ( in particular , the long missing-in-action Nancy Kyes ( a . k . a . Nancy Loomis , " Annie " from the original film ) ) and offer their thoughts . Ultimately , the recent two-disc Anchor Bay DVD release containing this documentary looks to be a real dream come true for any admirer of the series , with enough extras to keep the interested consumer busy for a while . It's an impressive piece of work all around .
An interesting combo of the sleazy and the sordid .	The late cult favorite Paul Bartel , whose subsequent directorial efforts included " Death Race 2000 " , " Cannonball ! " , and " Eating Raoul " , made his directing debut with this creepy and offbeat little thriller . Sexy young Cheryl Stratton ( Ayn Ruymen ) is a not-so-innocent teen who's run away from her home and come to live in the run-down hotel operated by her decidedly strict and eccentric Aunt Martha ( Lucille Benson ) . The hotel is populated by very odd folk , not the least of which is the off-putting photographer George ( John Ventantonio ) , who develops a fixation on our nubile young " heroine " . One of the most intriguing aspects about this low-key , moody little movie is the fact that Cheryl is not the typically virtuous and wholesome type that we might expect . Even with warning signs for her to heed , she's more intrigued than repelled , willing enough to play along with Georges ' schemes . Bartel definitely has a nice touch for strange and twisted humor ( the ultimate revelation about George is particularly effective ) . One of the lowly denizens of the hotel in particular stands out : the reverend with the secret fetish for the kinky . Bartel also drenches his picture in atmosphere and the dark side of the sexual revolution of the times . In fact , he captures the ambiance of the period very well . His cinematographer here is future mainstream action director Andrew Davis ( " Under Siege " , " The Fugitive " ) , who helps him tremendously in this regard . The music by Hugo Friedhofer is likewise quite enjoyable . Ruymen is good in the lead , with Ventantonio playing his disturbing part for everything it's worth ( he has one memorable scene involving a syringe full of blood and a blow-up doll , but I must say that you just have to see it for yourself ) , and Stanley Livingston of the 60's TV series ' My Three Sons ' has a small role as a kid who befriends Cheryl , but the movie emerges as Lucille Bensons ' show . Usually seen in smaller roles for the duration of her career , she's afforded a major opportunity to really strut her stuff in a change-of-pace substantial part , and she walks away with all of her scenes . This quirky low-budget horror / exploitation movie is definitely worth looking into for those viewers with a taste for the bizarre .
Entertaining and worthwhile .	Classic , influential creature feature about the dangerous Gill-Man , discovered on an expedition in the Amazon , who proceeds to terrorize / kill the team members . The pompous Mark Williams ( Richard Denning ) , acting more like a big game hunter than a scientist , wants to bring back the creature as " proof " , but level-headed David Reed ( Richard Carlson ) is more concerned with everybody's survival . The gorgeous Julia ( Julie ) Adams is Kay Lawrence , the obligatory damsel-in-distress , not a " modern " woman by any stretch of the imagination , since her purpose is basically to scream whenever the monster appears , and to always be in peril . " Creature From the Black Lagoon " is a sometimes suspenseful and sometimes jolting ( aided no end by a music score full of loud " stings " ) horror thriller . It's done in director Jack Arnold's efficient style , with a good pace and an excellent cast . The creature may be a typical " man in a suit " type thing , but it looks fierce and is capably played by both swimmer / diver Ricou Browning ( in water ) and stuntman Ben Chapman ( on land ) . Although this was originally made as a 3-D feature , I found that it doesn't need to be in 3-D to work . For me , it wasn't altogether scary , but pretty thrilling nonetheless ( the movie has its share of atmosphere ; I believe that it was filmed on location in Florida ) . CFTBL would be followed by two sequels in the next two years , and a remake ( Yes ! Yet another remake ! Does anybody even TRY to come up with new ideas anymore ? ) is planned for next year .
A choice exploitation action flick !	Basically decent " outlaw " prostitute named " Princess " ( Season Hubley ) , who answers to no-one but herself , agrees to help the cops nab a particularly lethal and monumentally slimy pimp named " Ramrod " ( the incredible Wings Hauser , who ultimately walks away with the movie ) after he molests , mutilates and murders one of her friends . As you can see , there's not an over-abundance of plot here , but this flashy and trashy B movie delivers the goods in an always entertaining way . It's a wholly visceral crime picture that pulls no punches in portraying the seamy side of life . Director Gary Sherman , breaking out of the horror mold after giving us the excellent fright features " Raw Meat " ( a . k . a . " Deathline " ) and " Dead & Buried " , immerses us deeply in this sad and sordid underworld . There's no shortage of depraved , freaky , or destitute folks to fill up the screen . Hubley plays her tough , independent , good-hearted character with a strong degree of integrity and conviction and Gary Swanson ratchets up the intensity as a determined , not-all-that-likable detective , while the supporting cast is littered with familiar faces like Pepe Serna , Beverly Todd , future MTV VJ Nina Blackwood ( as the ill-fated friend ) , Lydia Lei , Fred " Rerun " Berry ( as a sugar pimp who has the horrible misfortune to get in Ramrods ' way , and pays a big price for it ) , Grand L . Bush , Michael Ensign , Jonathan Haze , Stack Pierce , and Cheryl " Rainbeaux " Smith . But this emerges as Wings Hausers ' show all the way . The boyish-faced , curly-haired actor brings true tenacity and ferocity to the role of Ramrod . Not only that , but Wings further entertains us by growling and belting out the gritty rock theme " Neon Slime " over the opening and closing credits . A tough , hard-hitting , and potent film of its type ( yet not without a real sense of humor ) , " Vice Squad " steadily moves along to its inevitable final confrontation . Shot with typical style by ace cinematographer John Alcott , best known for his association with Stanley Kubrick , it oozes prime seedy atmosphere and menace . It's a grand old time , recommended viewing for anyone interested in the great sleazy B pictures of yesteryear .
A good deal of macabre fun .	" Necronomicon " is a three-part horror anthology linked by the title book , and based on stories by H . P . Lovecraft . It offers an entertaining cast , enjoyable splatter and monster creations , a fine amount of foreboding and gloom , striking imagery , and a great sense of fun . It's got stories within stories , and they're all told very well . In the wrap-around story " The Library " , Lovecraft himself , well played by Jeffrey Combs of " Re-Animator " fame , seeks the book in the bowels of a library . The three stories that he reads make up the rest of the trilogy . " The Drowned " tells the story of Edward De Lapoer ( Bruce Payne ) traveling to the extremely decrepit seaside hotel that he has inherited . It seems that his predecessor , Jethro ( Richard Lynch ) renounced God after the death of his wife and son and resurrected them using the Necronomicon . This had horrifying repercussions , also felt by Edward when it's revealed that he has a tragedy in his past as well . Tinged by an overwhelming feeling of guilt and grief , " The Drowned " has atmosphere to spare , a mighty fearsome monster , and absolutely fine performances by Payne and Lynch , two actors often cast as villains who get a chance to shine in against-type parts . " The Cold " features Dennis Christopher as reporter Dale Porkel , who comes to interview Amy , hoping that she will help to shed some light on various murders committed in the area . She tells him the story of her mother : a runaway named Emily , who stays at a hotel run by Lena ( Millie Perkins ) . She meets the mysterious Dr . Madden ( David Warner ) , whose apartment is kept extremely cold due to his strange medical condition . She realizes that Lena and Madden are up to some very dark doings in order to keep him alive . The cast does fine work ; as before , an actor often associated with villainous roles , Warner , is superb as a character not entirely unsympathetic . The episode is quite creepy with good and icky makeup effects . " Whispers " stars beautiful Signy Coleman as tough , relentless cop Sarah , pursuing a perp with her partner ( and father of her baby ) Paul ( Obba Babatunde ) . She and Paul have an accident and she sees someone dragging Paul into a nearby building . As she explores it , she receives supposed " help " from two off-putting characters , Mrs . and Mr . Benedict ( Judith Drake and always welcome character actor Don Calfa , Ernie in " The Return of the Living Dead " ) and comes to realize just how very , very screwed she is . Lots of truly hellish imagery in this one , with a steadily mounting sense of dread and doom . As Lovecraft finishes reading , he manages to escape the demonic forces that he's unleashed , and drives off into the night with the Necronomicon in his hands , full of inspiration . These stories are all a good deal of ghoulish entertainment , with well realized downbeat conclusions ( even if some twists aren't exactly unpredictable ) . Christophe Gans ( " The Brotherhood of the Wolf " ) , Shusuke Kaneko , and Brian Yuzna combine their directorial styles for the stories , and it all blends together quite well . " Necronomicon " is a fine horror anthology and it's a pity that this particular type of film doesn't get seen more often . It should provide a decent night's viewing for horror fans .
" If this story were a movie , it would take three or four sequels to do it justice . "	Chucky's one-time girlfriend , Tiffany ( Jennifer Tilly ) tracks his remains down and resurrects the savage miniature psycho - only to end up the same way herself , trapped inside a doll . Together , they set out for New Jersey where Chucky's human remains were buried so that Chucky can retrieve an all-important amulet , involving two young lovers ( Katherine Heigl and Nick Stabile ) in their plans . Fourth " Child's Play " movie takes off in a new direction , opting not to truly scare the viewer and instead turning into more of a savage black comedy , with a number of good lines and dialog between Chucky and Tiffany . It actually works , and the film is pretty entertaining , with amusing supporting work by Alexis Arquette , Gordon Michael Woolvett ( T . V . ' s ' Andromeda ' ) , and John Ritter , of all people . It's bloody , nasty , fairly slick , and amusingly scripted . . . although I have to wonder why Chucky is only now recalling that ( do I have to say SPOILER here ? ) HE HAS TO HAVE THAT AMULET in order for a successful transition of his soul to a host , human or otherwise . Then again , he didn't seem to need it when transferring Tiffany's soul to a doll , did he ? The film's best line is a good in-joke for horror buffs , spoken after Ritter's character has been disposed of . Actress Janet Kidder , who has a small role , is Margot Kidder's niece .
Richard Dix is excellent in this Val Lewton production .	This film in the Lewton canon doesn't really qualify as horror , but it's still quite moody and atmospheric . Dix plays Will Stone , captain of a ship named the Altair . His new Third Officer is a young man named Tom Merriam ( Russell Wade ) . Stone is established as a lonely man with not much to live for but a belief in " authority " that he espouses at every turn . When Tom begins to suspect that Will will do anything to get his point across - including murdering his own men - he has a tough time convincing other people that the captain's motives aren't pure . " The Ghost Ship " is an effective psychological drama that gives its star a chance to subtly delineate a man slowly going over the edge . As I've said , it does exhibit the qualities of Lewton's best work by creating an eerie mood and atmosphere . As the plot unfolds , it's easy to sympathize with Tom and hope that Will can be exposed . Will still has the support of his crew and agent and Tom is at the disadvantage for not having solid enough evidence . The main cast all does creditable work ; Edith Barrett , Ben Bard and Edmund Glover are fine in support . Also noteworthy is the sharp-featured Skelton Knaggs as the mute Finn , a character seemingly taken for granted but far more observant and intelligent than others give him credit for . And it's cool to see Lawrence Tierney , still a few years away from his breakout role as the title character in " Dillinger " , as the ill-fated Louie Parker . " The Ghost Ship " is over pretty quickly ( running only an hour and ten minutes ) , with a resolution that does feel a little abrupt , but the film is still effectively creepy and enticing , with a straightforward story and a palpable sense of menace .
A great 1980's action comedy !	Hilarious odd-couple / road movie / cop movie / action comedy packaged together very well . Robert De Niro is Jack Walsh , an ousted former Chicago cop now working as a bounty hunter , who is determined to bring in bail-jumping accountant Jonathan Mardukas ( Charles Grodin ) who embezzled millions of dollars from nasty Mafioso Jimmy Serrano ( Dennis Farina ) . Of course , it is not that easy , both the FBI and the Mob are on their trail - and the whole story snowballs into a sorry ordeal along the lines of " Planes , Trains and Automobiles " as Walsh and Mardukas are forced to continuously change their mode of transportation . This was made back when producer / director Martin Brest made GOOD movies - not notorious box office duds like " Gigli " . He only makes a movie once every couple of years so he shouldn't have disappointed everybody like that . Anyway , THIS movie , while rather lengthy , is upbeat , action-packed , and pretty funny , as the swaggering De Niro and the very dry Grodin display perfect odd-couple chemistry . Good supporting cast , too , and lively music score by Danny Elfman . This here is the kind of action comedy that is actually fun to watch , without getting lame or stupid or annoying . Followed by two made for television movies in which Jack Walsh was played by Christopher McDonald . " I tell you what , you don't co-operate , you're gonna be suffering from fist-o-phobia . "
Christopher Lee and Mario Bava make for a great combination .	Genre icon Lee plays Kurt Menliff , the black sheep of the Menliff family . He's returned to their mansion after some time away , which displeases most of them , with the exception of Nevenka ( the quite sensuous Daliah Lavi ) , with whom he'd had a rather kinky relationship . She still finds herself drawn to him . Soon after his arrival , he is murdered , but returns as a ghost armed with a whip , putting Nevenka in mortal terror and confounding the rest of the family . It isn't often that one can use both the words romantic and sadomasochistic in describing any movie , but they both fit in this instance . It's equal parts haunting , eerie , kinky , and sentimental , provoking different emotions from scene to scene . The legendary director does typically superior work in terms of mood , atmosphere , lighting , and tension . It has the ability to really put a viewer on edge , and even has a psychological quality to it as well . The acting from the attractive cast is a heavy asset ; Lee is as solid as he's ever been , despite the curious fact that he was dubbed by another actor . Lavi and Isli Oberon are beauties in the classic tradition of foreign horror and deliver good performances to boot . Tony Kendall , Harriet Medin , and Gustavo De Nardo also co-star . An intriguing blend of the whodunit , an old-fashioned ghost story , and a tragic and unconventional love story , " The Whip and the Body " marks a major accomplishment for Bava . It moves slowly and surely towards a twist ending , always maintaining a creepy , somber , and affecting mood . Those new to the directors ' works should definitely check it out .
I Am Thoroughly Impressed .	Very successful cops-and-criminals tale of an efficient detective ( Al Pacino ) picking up the trail of an equally efficent criminal ( Robert De Niro ) . Film also focuses on their interactions with their colleagues as well as their troubled romantic lives . This film couldn't get much better , folks . The only - I repeat ONLY - problem here is that it's a VERY long movie and it may be hard for some people to stick with it . Trust me , though , it's worth it . Reasonably intelligent , expertly made , action-packed ( with one absolutely ferocious gun battle ) , and well cast ( and well acted , needless to say ) right down the line . Major point of interest has to be the climactic scene where Pacino's and De Niro's characters get together for a cup of coffee and reveal a lot about themselves to each other - most tellingly , the fact that both are practically married to their careers . I'm sure some people will want to check out this film just to see two solid Oscar-winning veterans working together ( although their time together is relatively brief ) . Can I say something , though ? Pacino's character , is like some of his other characters , somewhat over the top . Does he have to yell so much ? De Niro's character is more restrained and therefore more interesting . There's not a boring performance in this movie ! Pacino , De Niro , Jon Voight , Diane Venora , Val Kilmer , Ted Levine , Wes Studi , Mykelti Williamson , Tom Noonan , William Fichtner , Natalie Portman , Dennis Haysbert - they're ALL great . , folks ; I say if you've got the patience to sit through a very long movie , this film is worth the time .
A very entertaining 50's sci-fi classic .	Canadian scientist Andre Delambre ( Al / David Hedison ) is intently working on teleportation . However , when he experiments on himself , he gets his genetic material swapped with that of a fly - the result is a humanoid , man-sized thing with an enormous fly head , and an elusive fly with a teeny-tiny human head and arm . Although I've seen the David Cronenberg remake first ( itself an excellent film , and one of its directors ' finest moments ) , this classic science fiction drama deals with loss and tragedy just as well if not better . It's intelligent , and deeply affecting . Patricia Owens does a good job of drawing me in with her performance , successfully conveying the helplessness of a wife who desperately wants to help her husband but cannot . Hedison is good in an engaging performance , and continues to elicit sympathy after encased in the unwieldy fly head . Vincent Price is solid in support , playing the loyal and concerned brother who is determined to get to the bottom of his brothers ' demise . Also doing good work are Herbert Marshall as the inspector and Kathleen Freeman as the maid . The film-makers hold off the big reveal as long as possible , so it's all the more effective when it finally does happen . Also helping this film to stick in the memory is its creepy climax ( " Help me ! Help me ! " ) , and its brief " fly vision " scene . It's deliberately paced , but is worth sticking with . It's got some good sets , a fine music score , and very nice CinemaScope photography . It's a truly remarkable picture that belies its B level nature every step of the way . A big financial success back in its day , it led to the sequels " Return of the Fly " and " Curse of the Fly " , followed many years later by Cronenbergs ' remake , itself followed by a sequel .
One of the best sequels EVER !	After 57 years of drifting through space , Ellen Ripley ( Sigourney Weaver ) is picked up and brought back to civilization . She learns that the planet she and her ill-fated comrades visited in the first movie has now been colonized . When contact is lost with the colonists , Ripley is not the least bit surprised . " The Company " sends a squad of marines to the planet on the chance that xenomorphs ( i . e . aliens ) are to blame , and Ripley agrees to go along as an advisor . A very long movie , especially in the 155-minute director's cut ( including footage that used to be included just for TV showings ) but so entertaining that it's not even a quibble . It's gripping , compelling , scary , action-packed , and suspenseful . It doesn't have the stark , bleak simplicity and sense of innovation that the first movie did - but boy is it cool . It does take a while to get going as the events of the movie are set up , but once it kicks into high gear . . . Excellent cast ; Weaver is wonderful and ably supported by a cast including two actors who worked for director James Cameron in " The Terminator " : Michael Biehn ( Cpl . Hicks ) and Lance Henriksen ( the android Bishop ) . The quiet stoicism of several characters , including spunky young survivor ' Newt ' ( Carrie Henn ) is a little too impressive to be believed ; for my money , the film's funniest / best performance is by Bill Paxton ( Lt . Hudson ) , who switches from obnoxious , swaggering overconfidence to flamboyant cowardice after his first run-in with the aliens . And how about selfish Company weasel Paul Reiser - in a good dramatic performance as Carter J . Burke - his lies ( " I work for the Company , but basically I'm an okay guy . " " That's the plan . You have our word on it . " ) are some of the biggest whoppers I've ever heard in this kind of film . But one of the best things about it is the creature effects , especially the design of the fearsome Queen Alien - which is truly a sight to behold when I first see it . The movie doesn't even lose anything after repeated viewings .
I think it's fantastic .	Dustin Hoffman plays a disgraced former newsman named Max Brackett , who inadvertently stumbles into the story that could rejuvenate his career : security guard Sam Baily ( John Travolta ) , who's miserable over being laid off , has tried to talk to his former boss ( Blythe Danner ) at gunpoint , and ended up taking hostages . Brackett proceeds to manipulate the course of events - and Baily himself - in order to ensure a major news spectacle . This is tops in my book ; I just thought it was so compelling , and even though I've seen it once before , I still got a charge out of it . It kept me interested , and it featured great performances by all the major actors - especially Hoffman , who really owns the movie . It certainly paints an ugly picture of the media - and although I'm sure there are a number of media types who really do glorify and magnify stories at the expense of facts , I'm not ignorant enough to believe they are all like that . This is a genuinely entertaining movie and I would recommend it to others .
" They're all going to laugh at you "	Heartbreaking story , based on Stephen King's first full-length published novel , also the breakthrough film for director Brian DePalma . Sissy Spacek makes a lasting impact as Carrie White , an awkward and ostracized teenager whose classmates can't stand her merely because she's shy and " different " . She is finally pushed over the edge at the climactic school prom , unleashing her telekinetic abilities in revenge . One of the best Stephen King adaptations ever , certainly one of the saddest , most poignant , and bitter movies I've ever seen . I feel sympathy for Carrie White that I don't feel for a lot of movie characters . Overall , this story is enough to shock , appall , and move me , despite occasional goofy comic touches like the tuxedo shopping scene and the gym detention music . Spacek is both beautiful and wonderful , but it's not just her that shines - there's John Travolta , in his first major movie role , Amy Irving , P . J . Soles who would be in " Halloween " two years later , Betty Buckley , and a sexy Nancy Allen who would go on to become director Brian De Palma's wife ( for a bit ) as well as work for him a few more times . Overall , it COULD have been more on the routine side but Spacek and composer Pino Donaggio's music really do help to make it stick in the memory . Of course , those 1970's styles and fashions just seem highly amusing to me now . This marked the first time that Irving would work with her mother , actress Priscilla Pointer , and they've worked together numerous times since , with Pointer often playing the mother of Irving's character . " Carrie " was followed by a 23-years belated sequel ( or follow-up ) in 1999 and the more recent ( and seemingly pointless ) television remake in
Excellent , classic action film .	In an Academy Award-winning performance , Gene Hackman plays " Popeye " Doyle , a narcotics detective with the demeanor of a pit bull . He won't let things go , even though some times his hunches do not lead to anything . He and his partner Buddy " Cloudy " Russo ( Roy Scheider ) get wind of something big when they start tailing a wise guy wannabe , Sal Boca ( Tony Lo Bianco ) , whose ambition has led him to help arrange a massive drug deal being engineered by a crafty Frenchman , Alain Charnier ( Fernando Rey ) . The real-life detectives Eddie Egan and Sonny Grosso provide the inspiration for this riveting movie , made with great precision by William Friedkin . The film moves at full steam ; the pace is so efficient that it compels one to keep paying attention . It's also got some humor here and there : note a scene where a weary " Popeye " has to show " Cloudy " that he's been cuffed to his bed by a one-night-stand . It's edgy , vivid hand-held camera-work is stellar , it gets fine use out of its NYC locations ( especially the seedier ones ) , Don Ellis's music is superb , and its tough , no-nonsense , gritty realism plays a big part in why the film works as well as it does . The car chase is especially impressive : it's so brilliantly edited and so visceral that's it hard to believe it was pieced together over a span of weeks ! This movie also helped to enter into popular culture the whole idea of the " good cop / bad cop " routine , since Egan ( upon whom Doyle is based ) would yell out bizarre , out-of-left-field inquiries such as " When did you last pick your feet in Poughkeepsie ? " and leave his subjects to feel more comfortable answering the more reasonable questions asked by the partner , thereby incriminating themselves . Also effective is a scene where we realize that Charnier has been toying with " Popeye " , knowing full well that he's being tailed . The final shootout ( and enigmatic ending ) end the movie on a memorable final note . The cast is absolutely superb . Hackman turns " Popeye " into a true morally ambiguous force-of-nature : no matter what he has to do , he'll get the bad guys . He certainly shows no inclination to be politically correct , either ( Charnier is actually referred to as " Frog One " ! ) . Scheider holds his own alongside Hackman ; the two are completely convincing as detectives and partners . Rey is an enjoyably dapper , calm , and intelligent nemesis , and Lo Bianco is solid as Boca . The supporting cast includes Egan ( who would end up pursuing a career in acting ) and Grosso themselves as the superiors , with other good performances by Alan Weeks as a perplexed and scared suspect , Al Fann as an informant , Harold Gary as mobster Weinstock , Arlene Farber as Boca's wife Angie , and Marcel Bozzuffi & Frederic de Pasquale as Charnier's accomplices . Randy Jurgenson , another real-life detective who has served as consultant and performer in a number of features , also appears . " The French Connection " is one of those classics of American film that ought to be seen at least once . It's an undeniably influential film and is compelling to watch . Screenplay by Ernest Tidyman , based on the book by Robin Moore . In addition to Hackman , Friedkin , editor Jerry Greenberg , Tidyman , and the picture all picked up Academy Awards , with Scheider ( supporting actor ) , Owen Roizman ( cinematography ) , and Theodore Soderberg & Christopher Newman ( for sound ) picking up nominations . Followed by a sequel four years later , and a TV series pilot ( with Ed O'Neill as Doyle ! ) in
Classy , exciting , and definitive entry in the legendary Bond series .	Superagent James Bond ( Sean Connery , as charming as always ) is interrupted during a vacation for the task of keeping an eye on Auric Goldfinger ( German actor Gert Frobe , dubbed by Englishman Michael Collins ) . In time , Bond discovers Goldfinger's master plan to contaminate the gold supply in Fort Knox in order to maximize the value of his own gold supply . Assisting Goldfinger is supremely sexy pilot Honor Blackman , blessed with one of the singularly most memorable monikers for a Bond girl ever in " Pussy " Galore . " Goldfinger " is one of those films where everything comes together very well . It's fast paced and displays the kind of wit and humor that lets us know that none of this will ever be taken too seriously . It's grand escapist fare moving from one dazzling set piece to another . There's the sight of ill-fated early victim Jill ( Shirley Eaton ) completely covered in gold paint , the sight of Bond ( actually displaying a genuine and obvious nervousness for once ) in danger of being cut in half by a laser , the climactic raid on Fort Knox , and so much more . The film is certainly an important entry in the franchise for firmly establishing such elements as well staged action , impressive foreign locales , wonderfully elaborate villainous designs , awesome gadgets ( the Aston Martin makes its first appearance here ) , and colorful bad guys . Goldfinger and mostly mute sidekick / henchman Oddjob ( Harold Sakata ) became so iconic as to get spoofed many times since . Desmond Llewelyn as gadget designer Q makes his first substantial appearance in a Bond film and is delightful as always . In addition to series regulars Bernard Lee as M and Lois Maxwell as Moneypenny , the supporting cast includes Tania Mallett as Jill's revenge-seeking sister Tilly , Martin Benson as the mobster Solo , Cec Linder as Bond's CIA contact / friend Felix Leiter , Michael Mellinger as henchman Kisch , and Burt Kwouk ( Cato in the " Pink Panther " series ) as Mr . Ling . It gets off to a grand start with what is , for my money , one of the catchiest , most irresistible Bond theme songs ever , belted out with great gusto by Ms . Shirley Bassey . Production designer Ken Adam's set for the interior of Fort Knox is amazing . " Goldfinger " is as fun and engaging as any spy adventure could be . It's one of the all-time great films of its genre .
