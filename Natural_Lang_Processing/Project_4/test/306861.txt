Sneakin ' Around With The Little Rascals	An OUR GANG Comedy Short . It's SPOOKY HOOKY time for all concerned when Spanky , Alfalfa , Buckwheat & Porky break into the schoolhouse one dark & stormy night to retrieve a faked doctor's note left on teacher's desk . . . A few laughs here , but the Short is too short to really develop the chills . Highlight : Buckwheat meets the skeleton .
Will Rogers Goes Time Traveling	A radio man visits a spooky old house at night . There he briefly meets the strange inhabitants , including a mad scientist who tries to use radio waves to tune into the past . An accidental bang on the head sends the radio man back to King Arthur's Court . So starts this version of the oft-filmed Mark Twain tale , this time re-worked for the personality of Will Rogers - who certainly doesn't sound like a Connecticut Yankee . In fact , Will is the main reason to watch this early talkie . His humor - one suspects much was ad-libbed - was always refreshing . Fox obviously spent a lot of money on the Camelot scenes ; they look very good . Many of the performers , however , have trouble with their stilted dialogue . Myrna Loy looks beautifully evil , but her part is not developed . The always lovely Maureen O'Sullivan is totally wasted in a small role . William Farnum does the best he can as Arthur , but the other male co-stars are much hampered by the script or just plain immature acting . Will Rogers , as always , is wonderful - delivering his lines in his soft , shy , Oklahoma drawl . He had star presence without even trying . It is terrific fun seeing him win a joust with a knight by using his excellent roping & riding skills . Mark Twain's Ghost must have smiled . . .
Big Times At The Mega Studio	An MGM Short Subject . A large group of very special businessmen arrive in Los Angeles and are given extra special treatment by the Hollywood hierarchy of MGM Studios . This little film was made as a souvenir record of the 1937 MGM Convention , attended by the sales force , distributors , theater managers & various high muckety-mucks from the New York City office of Loew's Inc . - MGM's parent company . Never meant to be seen by the public - hence the unedited profanity - it was rushed through production so as to be ready to be shown at the Convention's opening night banquet . Basically , it is an exercise in quiet tedium . The inebriated Conventioneers , looking distressingly like a crime family and acting silly with the pretty girls supplied by the Studio , are seen passing time on the Westward heading train . We are then treated to a rather glutinous welcoming speech by Louis B . Mayer , after which comes seemingly endless footage of the relentlessly cheerful hordes disembarking their buses at the Studio . Oscar material , this isn't . Because of the film's extremely rapid gestation , there is no time for some of the expected niceties . Especially missed is any identification given to individuals in the crowd of sullen stars who eventually show-up , leaving the viewer to quickly ID them as they parade past the camera ( ' Isn't that Charles Boyer dressed as Napoleon ? ' ' Look ! There's little Freddie Bartholomew ! ' ' That has to be Oliver Hardy ! ' ) The film's humorous opening credits claim Leo ( the Lion ) as the entire creative & production crew .
Sonja Skates - Script Sinks	A pretty miss in ICELAND falls for an American Marine corporal stationed there temporarily during World War Two . Sonja Henie was Norway's ice queen when she won Olympic gold medals for skating in 1928 , 1932 & 1936 . After going professional , she began a celebrated movie career at 20th Century Fox in 1936 with her American film debut , ONE IN A MILLION . Beautiful & talented , as well as being a natural in front of the cameras , she carved out her own special niche during Hollywood's Golden Age . Although Miss Henie's ice routines may look antiquated by comparison to modern champions , there was nothing antique about her dazzling smile or sparkling personality . In this regard , some of today's snowflake princesses could still learn a great deal from her . As her career progressed , it became increasingly difficult for 20th Century Fox to find decent stories for Miss Henie and the excuses for the lavish ice dancing numbers were often implausible . No matter . Audiences did not flock to her films to watch Sonja recite Shakespeare . The movies were meant to be pure escapist fantasy , plain & simple . ICELAND is no exception and its story is often quite ludicrous . However , the skating episodes are pleasing and there is a generous amount of band music supplied by the Sammy Kaye Orchestra , which introduces ' There Will Never Be Another You , ' by Mack Gordon & Harry Warren . Thanks to the script , John Payne's romance with Sonja is kept a rather dull affair . As Payne's sidekick , Jack Oakie comes across as loud & annoying . Felix Bressart , a fine actor when given something decent to work with , plays Sonja's silly Papa . Fritz Feld makes the most of his few minutes as an inquisitive Icelandic functionary . Movie mavens will recognize an oddly uncredited Sterling Holloway , who is very funny as Sonja's erstwhile suitor . Ultimately , though , this is Sonja's show . She glides effortlessly into the viewer's heart , while balancing on a thin edge of silver , suspended over frozen water .
One Of The Dreadful Films John Gilbert Made For MGM To Fulfill His Contract	Here comes the Merchant Marine , the toughest seamen afloat . Sailing into every sea , a job in every port , a girl in every bar . Out of the way there ! Here they come , up from the docks , looking for some shore leave . Look out ! Make WAY FOR A SAILOR ! According to cinematic legend , all the talkie MGM films starring John Gilbert were dreadful - the result of a bitter hatred between Gilbert ( the highest paid star in Hollywood , with a $1 . 5 million contract ) & studio boss Louis B . Mayer . A determination on Gilbert's part to fulfill the contract , and a campaign instituted by Mayer to destroy Gilbert's career - including spreading the rumor that Gilbert's voice was ' high & feminine ' , culminated in several unwatchable movies . Not entirely true . The Studio had a huge financial investment in Jack Gilbert and was not going to completely cut its own throat by showcasing him in nothing but dreck . Of the 8 talkies in which he appeared as solo star ( 1929 - HIS GLORIOUS NIGHT ; 1930 - REDEMPTION ; WAY FOR A SAILOR ; 1931 - GENTLEMAN'S FATE ; THE PHANTOM OF PARIS ; WEST OF BROADWAY ; 1932 - DOWNSTAIRS ; 1933 - FAST WORKERS ) most were certainly rather ghastly . WAY FOR A SAILOR falls into that unfortunate category . Gilbert tries hard throughout the film , but it never comes together . Atmospherics are of the ' B Movie ' variety , and while the rescue at sea sequence is exciting , it's not enough to save the film . Even wonderful Wallace Beery , bluff & hearty , can't pull it off , though he certainly is entertaining & manages to steal every scene he's in . And lovely Leila Hyams is boring , thanks mostly to a lackluster script . Look fast and you'll spot Doris Lloyd & the inimitable Polly Moran , both enjoyable as dockside floozies ( Polly wields a mean mallet ) . Movie mavens will recognize Sojin as the Oriental procurer ; quick-eyed viewers may spot an uncredited Ray Milland as a ship's officer . Finally , about The Voice . There was nothing at all strange or unnaturally high about Gilbert's voice . As a matter of fact , it was of medium range & rather cultured & refined . Which was the crux of the problem , of course . While it is possible that no voice could have ever matched the perfect one viewers heard in their minds while watching his strong , virile silent roles , the reality was very different from what they wanted to hear ( imagine Robert Montgomery's voice coming out of Clark Gable's mouth . ) Gilbert was doomed from his first scene in his debut talkie ; his war with Mayer only intensified the agony . He would die in 1936 , forgotten by most of his former fans , at the age of only 36 .
Odd Mix Of Vulgarity & Romance	Welcome to the WONDER BAR ! Your host , Al Wonder ( Al Jolson ) promises you the finest music & entertainment Paris can offer in this wonderful year of 1934 . Our featured dancers , Harry & Inez ( Ricordo Cortez & Dolores Del Rio ) will thrill you with their passion ; they say that Inez adores Harry , but that he , a true gigolo , loves only money . Seated on the sidelines is a wealthy married woman ( Kay Francis ) who is supposedly giving Harry diamonds for his affections . Al loves Inez , as does his boy bandleader & crooner Tommy ( Dick Powell ) . And if you glance over at the bar you'll see a French Captain ( Robert Barrat ) , bankrupt , disposing of his last cash & valuables , hinting darkly that we should not miss tomorrow morning's newspapers . Al himself will of course entertain us with a selection of tunes sung in his inimitable style . Yes , I think we can promise you an evening you won't forget , full of waltzes & romance , love & hate , murder & suicide ! Right this way , mesdames & messieurs ! Released just prior to the imposition of the Production Code , this neglected film is an example of too much talent & not enough taste . Sex in several illicit forms seems to preoccupy much of the dialogue & plot ( watch the reaction on Jolie's face as the two young men dance past him ) . Some of the references are a bit sly , others obscure , but the decadence lingers on . . . That having been said , the film does have strengths . Jolson is wonderful to watch . His outsized personality was too big for any screen to hold ; nonetheless , his talent to entertain was immense & he doesn't stint here . Francis ( she has little to do ) & Del Rio are both lovely and Powell is in good voice . The comedy is handled by two American couples , Guy Kibbee & Ruth Donnelley and Hugh Herbert & Louise Fazenda , who bicker and flirt and have almost nothing to do with the rest of the plot . Al Dubin & Harry Warren provided some good tunes for the picture . Powell sings ' Why Do I Dream Those Dreams ? ' & ' Wonder Bar ' - while Jolson sinks his teeth into ' Welcome To My Wonder Bar / Vive La France . ' Busby Berkeley was the dance choreographer and he provides one of his finest creations , ' Don't Say Good-Night ' ( featuring the talents of Powell , Del Rio & Cortez ) , with the Berkeley hallmark : identical blonde chorus girls in swirling precision movements filmed from above , this time endlessly magnified by mirrors . It is gorgeous . On the other hand , Jolson , Berkeley , Dubin & Warren must take responsibility for one of the most outrageous sequences of the decade ( looking back with hindsight ) . ' Goin ' To Heaven On a Mule ' , which makes the Celestial City look like a honky-tonk Harlem populated by the Hall Johnson Choir , is amazingly racist & fascinatingly vulgar , a definite smudge on First National / Warner Bros . reputation .
Boat Racin ' With The Little Rascals	An OUR GANG Comedy Short . When Darla's affections turn from Alfalfa to Waldo & his miniature yacht , it's time to fight back . Challenging the verbose twerp to a boat race , Alfalfa skippers a floating contraption of his own , crewed by Buckwheat & Porky . Are these THREE MEN IN A TUB really up to the contest ? Not a lot of laughs in this little film . Waldo's persiflage & Darla's histrionics become rather annoying . Highlight : the three-duck power engine .
Playin ' Tackle Football With The Little Rascals	An OUR GANG Comedy Short . While away at military academy , Alfalfa has lied in his letters to Darla about his nonexistent football prowess . So , upon his return home , THE PIGSKIN PALOOKA finds himself the only hope for Spanky's All Stars in the big game against Spike's Tigers . . . Not many laughs in this little film . Alfalfa is the whole show here & he doesn't even get to sing !
Mr . William's Comedy Capers	DON'T BET ON BLONDES is the lesson New York City's most eccentric insurance broker learns the hard way . Fast-moving & fun , this is another example of the comedy crime picture that Warner Brothers was so expert at producing . Casts & plots could be shuffled almost endlessly , with very predictable results . While this assembly line approach created few classics , audience enjoyment could usually be assured . Suave and sophisticated , Warren William dominates this enjoyable little film with his debonair manner and slightly sardonic sense of humor . Playing a topnotch bookie who seamlessly switches to the more legal insurance racket , William is never less than absolutely in command of his performance . His pursuit of lovely Claire Dodd , even though she's the subject of his client's offbeat policy , illustrates his character's single-minded determination to get exactly what he wants . Whether in comedy or drama , Warren William was a most enjoyable actor to watch and it is a shame that he is almost forgotten now . A sturdy cast of costars gives fine support to William . Cuddly Guy Kibbee plays a Kentucky colonel desperate to retain his daughter's largess . Quick-tempered William Gargan is William's numbers expert , while Spencer Charters is his wise old company doctor . Clay Clement is a somewhat larcenous lawyer who has his eyes on Miss Dodd ; Walter Byron portrays a prissy hypochondriac actor . Mary Treen is William's no-nonsense secretary ; Hobart Cavanaugh plays a little man anxious to ensure his pregnant wife against having twins . Look fast for Herman Bing as a man with a dog . A young Errol Flynn , looking earnest & eager , plays a potential suitor for Miss Dodd ; he would become a major movie star very shortly . Wonderful Maude Eburne steals her scenes as a champion husband caller from Iowa . Movie mavens will recognize W . C . Fields ' longtime accomplice , Tammany Young , as an uncredited betting tout in the open scene .
Top Stars In Lavish , Intelligent Production	ROMEO AND JULIET , the scions of old Verona's two most powerful families , become the playthings of fate & the fools of fortune . This was a Very Big Film for MGM in 1936 . No ( reasonable ) expenses spared . Not only was the Studio tackling The Bard for the first time in a major way , but the extreme celebrity of the original play guaranteed a great deal of public attention . Several choice roles were available for MGM's brightest stars and the part of Juliet would be the desire of every young actress on the lot . Almost predictably the role went to Norma Shearer , who , as Irving Thalberg's wife , could almost pick & choose what she ( or Irving ) wanted . However , it should be stated at once that she is splendid in the role . Sweetly demure , innocent , apprehensive , fiercely protective of her love & recklessly heedless of her fate - she is Shakespeare's heroine . She is matched by Leslie Howard's Romeo . A bit giddy at first with puppy love , he quickly matures into a tender lover & vengeful killer , finally willing , like Shearer , to forego all of his Catholic teaching and commit self-murder , thus dooming himself to Perdition . Although decades too old for their roles ( Juliet was 12 , Miss Shearer 34 ; Romeo about 16 , Mr . Howard was 43 ) they understand and speak their lines much more beautifully & proficiently than any teenager . Shakespeare's lines are really verse of a high order and demands skill & maturity . Howard & Shearer certainly have no problem there . Nor were they the only members of the cast whose ages were rather past the prime . In his only feature length Shakespearean film , John Barrymore amply displays his celebrated talent in a bravura performance as an aging , sottish Mercutio . Barrymore understood the character thoroughly and he turns this strange , brilliant man into one of the film's chief treasures . Interestingly , much of his dialogue is rather scatological & gross , but being Shakespeare it seems to have flown under the radar of the Hays Office . Edna May Oliver steals nearly every scene she's in as Juliet's waspish , eccentric Nurse . Basil Rathbone makes a fiery , insolent Tybalt . Reginald Denny adds a touch of distinction in the throwaway role of Benvolio , while wonderful old Sir C . Aubrey Smith & Violet Kemble Cooper are colorful as Juliet's parents . At first blush , Andy Devine seems an odd choice for a Shakespearean production , but he is very competent as the Nurse's simpleminded servant . Somewhat lost in this excellent cast is English actor Ralph Forbes in the rather thankless role of the County Paris . His is a somewhat sad story . Although replete with talent & charm , he still never quite reached the top echelons of stardom . He would have made a great Romeo . Movie mavens will spot Katherine DeMille as the fair Rosaline ( her cousin Agnes de Mille was the film's choreographer ) and Ian Wolfe as the impoverished apothecary , both uncredited . The film has wonderful production values - the sets , costumes and background score ( borrowing themes from Tchaikovsky ) all of the highest quality . For a small chuckle , watch closely during Juliet's dance at the Capulet ball - one of the dancers behind her steps on her dress hem and nearly trips . It's very fast , but worth catching .
They Bring ' Em Back Alive	A Walt Disney DONALD DUCK Cartoon . POLAR TRAPPERS Donald & Goofy are hunting for wildlife to bring back to civilization . . . Here is a very funny little film from Disney's Golden Age . The Goof's hunt for a walrus is humorous , but hungry Donald's interaction with a colony of penguins he hopes to eat is hilarious . Clarence Nash provides the Duck with his unique voice . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by pictures & drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew comic figures on the sides of his vehicle . Back in Kansas City , along with artist Ub Iwerks , Walt developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated commercials and tiny cartoons for the local movie theaters . Always the innovator , his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series broke ground in placing a live figure in a cartoon universe . Business reversals sent Disney & Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923 , where Walt's older brother Roy became his lifelong business manager & counselor . When a mildly successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was snatched away by the distributor , the character of Mickey Mouse sprung into Walt's imagination , ensuring Disney's immortality . The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's screen debut , STEAMBOAT WILLIE ( 1928 ) , a tremendous audience success with its use of synchronized music . The SILLY SYMPHONIES soon appeared , and Walt's growing crew of marvelously talented animators were quickly conquering new territory with full color , illusions of depth and radical advancements in personality development , an arena in which Walt's genius was unbeatable . Mickey's feisty , naughty behavior had captured millions of fans , but he was soon to be joined by other animated companions : temperamental Donald Duck , intellectually-challenged Goofy and energetic Pluto . All this was in preparation for Walt's grandest dream - feature length animated films . Against a blizzard of doomsayers , Walt persevered and over the next decades delighted children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White , Pinocchio , Dumbo , Bambi & Peter Pan . Walt never forgot that his fortunes were all started by a mouse , or that childlike simplicity of message and lots of hard work always pay off .
Lee Tracy Excellent In MGM Debut	Flash ! Urgent ! CLEAR ALL WIRES ! Buckley Joyce Thomas ( Lee Tracy ) , ace reporter of the Chicago Globe , after returning from captivity in the Moroccan desert , now lands up to his ears in danger in Soviet Moscow . Hoping to interview New Russian citizens - and perhaps be seen hobnobbing with Stalin - he finds himself in intense trouble with dames ( Benita Hume & Una Merkel ) and suspected by the Secret Police of attempted murder ! Will this be Buckley Joyce Thomas ' last dispatch ? This is an enjoyable , fast-moving , if somewhat corny film , with dialogue & situations that let you know it was definitely produced pre-Production Code . It is interesting to see Hollywood's take on Red Russia only 15 years after the Revolution . Lee Tracy , having recently become a star at Warner Brothers , began his short stint at MGM with this film . He would appear in 4 MGM films in 1933 , and was well on his way to becoming the Studio's answer to Cagney , when he suffered a spectacular fall from grace the following year & was immediately fired from MGM . It is a shame he is almost forgotten today , as he was an exciting actor to watch : pushing the limit , rough edged , perfectly cast as nosy reporters , shyster lawyers or shady talent agents . The other members of the cast all do a fine job . Special mention should be made of James Gleason as Tracy's faithful factotum , and Ari Kutai as a Russian gofer . Movie mavens will spot Mischa Auer as a Moroccan prince & Akim Tamiroff as a sleazy Moscow hotel manager , both uncredited .
Mr . Dickens ' Characters Come To Life	A young boy grows to manhood in Victorian England . He will learn to deal with the early deaths of his parents . He will be cruelly abused by his sadistic stepfather . He will be betrayed by false friends . He will experience a brief , tragic marriage . He will also be showered with tenderness and affection from hearts good & true . He will grow to be a man made strong by adversity , but still wondering if he'll turn out to be the hero of his own life . He is DAVID COPPERFIELD . Charles Dickens ' masterpiece comes to marvelous life in this triumphant translation from literary classic into film . Enormous care was taken by MGM to get the look & feel just right - to make the viewer believe they were seeing the novel spread out before them , without a false moment from start to finish . ( The Studio even went so far as to use special on-location exterior filming at Canterbury Cathedral , a segment that only runs for a few seconds . ) The all-star cast is remarkable : Freddie Bartholomew , newly brought from England by his aunt , is perfect in the role of Young David ; his anguish at the death of his mother is almost palpable . Replacing a reluctant Charles Laughton , W . C . Fields proved a triumph in the comic role of the penniless Mr . Micawber , always confident of something ' turning up . ' ( You might think Fields ' American accent & mannerisms would tend to be grating , but he turns in what is arguably his finest performance . Fields had loved Dickens ' novels for years and always kept a few in his vaudeville trunk . He knew the role and how to play it . Here he takes the character of Micawber , tweaks it slightly , and delights us . ) Lionel Barrymore , as the old fisherman Dan'l Peggoty , adding yet another exceptional portrait to his gallery of character parts . Edna May Oliver is unforgettable as the stern , yet loving , Aunt Betsey , forever chasing donkeys off her property - fiercely defensive of those she cares for . Basil Rathbone as Mr . Murdstone , dark & dangerous , full of passions & fury . Maureen O'Sullivan as darling Dora , sweet & doomed . Roland Young as an oily Uriah Heep , sniveling & devious . Lewis Stone , Elizabeth Allan , Una O'Connor , Lennox Pawle , Elsa Lanchester , Violet Kemble Cooper , Madge Evans , Frank Lawton - all perfectly cast . ( Look for E . E . Clive , Lionel Belmore & Arthur Treacher in tiny uncredited roles . Sir Hugh Walpole , the celebrated English novelist who adapted the novel for the screen , appears as the Vicar . ) Savor this wonderful film again & again .
One More Kick At The Old Pigskin	A Walt Disney GOOFY Cartoon . Those two mighty bastions of collegiate sports , Taxidermy Tech . & Anthropology A . & M . , show HOW TO PLAY FOOTBALL - very badly . A multitude of Goofys spoof many of the finer points of the game , while strangely never really showing what the sport is actually all about . Gridiron fans will probably enjoy the jokes more than the uninitiated . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by pictures & drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew comic figures on the sides of his vehicle .

Acting Up	The FRIENDS AND LOVERS of a duplicitous female nearly have their lives destroyed by her wicked ways . This well-acted piece of fluff makes no attempt at serious entertainment but manages to engage the viewer nonetheless , mainly because of its unique cast . Lily Damita plays the sultry vamp who has no difficulty in enticing every man she meets . She is the female star of the picture , but her character is completely detestable . It says nothing positive about the moral discernment or intelligence level of the lead male players in the film that they are so completely seduced , for a time . Adolphe Menjou and Laurence Olivier play the two British officers , firm friends , who both fall into Damita's web . Making no pretense at behaving British , Menjou plays the debonair captain who must decide between carnality & comradeship . Olivier , who looks astonishingly young ( he turned 24 in 1931 ) is bright & energetic , projecting shadows of the future Lord Olivier as he advises Menjou as to the proper cut of tailored lapels . Whimsical Hugh Herbert puts his gentle humor to good use as Menjou's Scots valet . Acting as a sort of Greek Chorus to the proceedings around him , he easily steals most of his scenes . Erich von Stroheim , that Teutonic master of menace , dominates the screen with a cunning portrayal of Damita's vile husband . Like an uncoiled snake ready to strike , von Stroheim slithers about the screen , alert to deliver the maximum discomfort to his victims . As always , he is a joy to watch . Alas , that his role is so brief . Frederick Kerr as a boisterous old general , and Blanche Frederici as his straitlaced titled sister provide a few moments of sparkle at the end of the film . The action during the scenes set in India takes place entirely within the walls of a rather dull fort . The Studio , Radio Pictures , apparently were unwilling to spend an extra dime on ambiance .
Babysittin ' With The Little Rascals	An OUR GANG Comedy Short . The Gang coerces Spanky into watching their younger siblings . Caring for these FORGOTTEN BABIES turns out to be quite a chore , leaving the little nipper with no choice but to come up with some ingenious solutions to the baby-sitting problem . . . Spanky is in his glory in this hilarious little film , arguably his best . Highlight : Spanky's retelling the plot of the TARZAN movie he's recently seen to the audience of infants . Movie mavens will recognize Billy Gilbert's voice in the radio drama .
A Well-Crafted Thriller	It is a dark & stormy night . The old mansion stands alone in the driving rain . Inside wait eight people , driven apart by their animosities & fears . For they have much to be frightened about . Somewhere out in the storm there lurks a maniacal killer of young handicapped women - a murderer who has slain before & is ready to strike again . The pretty mute maid knows this . But does she know what is watching - and waiting - in the shadows of THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE ? This is a very fine chiller , most effective in the mood of mounting terror which it builds . A Gothic thriller of this sort is rather rare in the second half of the 1940's when , after the War , a new realism had settled on Hollywood . The performers do very nicely with their roles : Dorothy McGuire , young & vulnerable as the girl who hasn't spoken since witnessing her parents ' horrific deaths ; Kent Smith as the gallant doctor who wants to protect her ; George Brent & Gordon Oliver as the two half-brothers of the household , mistrustful & envious of each other's position ; wonderful old Ethel Barrymore , the dying matriarch , acid-tongued & suspicious of nearly everyone ; Sara Allgood as her nurse , resentful of her mistreatment ; Rhonda Fleming , the beautiful secretary , who may arouse passions once too often ; Elsa Lanchester & Rhys Williams as the domestics , she an alcoholic and he bitter and withdrawn . ( Film mavens will spot Ellen Corby as the woman at the boarding house murder scene . ) Special mention should be made of the mansion itself . In many ways it becomes a character in its own right . From top floor to cellar , we get to know its rooms & spaces well - with that twisting staircase tying all the nooks & crannies together .
Sonja Skates Circles Around Simplistic Plot	A pretty Norwegian coed finds plenty of romantic complications while working as an undercover campus mannequin at old Plymouth University . Sonja Henie was Norway's ice queen when she won Olympic gold medals in 1928 , 1932 & 1936 . After going professional , she began a celebrated movie career at 20th Century Fox in 1936 with ONE IN A MILLION , which was her American film debut . Beautiful & talented , as well as being a natural in front of the cameras , she carved out her niche during Hollywood's Golden Age . Although Henie's ice routines may look antiquated by comparison to modern champions , there was nothing antique about her dazzling smile or sparkling personality . In this regard , some of today's snowflake princesses could still learn a great deal from her . As her career progressed , it became increasingly difficult for Fox to find decent stories for Henie and the excuses for the lavish ice dancing numbers were often implausible . No matter . Audiences did not flock to her films to watch Sonja recite Shakespeare . The movies were meant to be pure escapist fantasy , plain & simple . MY LUCKY STAR is no exception and its story is often quite silly - relying a bit heavily on impromptu singing from its middle-aged college student cast , and borrowing too much from its predecessor , HAPPY LANDING . However , the moments on the ice never bore ( especially the Alice in Wonderland sequence - with music from Victor Herbert's Babes in Toyland - which closes the film ) and the co-stars are rather interesting . Stalwart Richard Greene is fine as Sonja's romantic interest , while Cesar Romero once again gets to display his comedic talents as a zany Romeo . Joan Davis grabs a lot of the laughs as Sonja's rubber-limbed roommate ; Buddy Ebsen is her slow-talking , fast-dancing beau . George Barbier is enjoyable as an apoplectic tycoon , as is laconic Arthur Treacher as his factotum . Miffed minx Gypsy Rose Lee and gung-ho student Elisha Cook Jr . are given little to do , but Billy Gilbert easily steals his few scenes as a soda jerk besotted by pistachio nuts . Ultimately , though , this is Sonja's show . She glides effortlessly into the viewer's heart , while balancing on a thin edge of silver , suspended over frozen water .
Out On A Ledge With Mr . Duck	A Walt Disney DONALD DUCK Cartoon . Donald & Pluto are WINDOW CLEANERS on a large skyscraper , but the Duck's day comes unstrung when he plays a joke on a very belligerent bee . . . This was one of a small handful of cartoons to co-star the Duck and the Pup , their very different personalities bouncing well off of each other . The addition of the Bee to the mix only adds to the vertiginous hilarity . The legendary Carl Barks wrote the story ; Clarence Nash supplied Donald with his unique voice . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by pictures & drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew comic figures on the sides of his vehicle .

A Goofy Sunday	A Walt Disney GOOFY Cartoon . FATHER'S WEEK-END turns out to be something rather different from the quite respite for which he'd hoped . This humorous little film has Goofy once again portraying his vaguely human alter ego George Geef . The viewer has to feel a tad sorry for him as he deals with all the complications the Disney animators can hurl his way . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by pictures & drawings .

Glossy Soaper	A small-town Kansas girl encounters hard luck & happiness when she follows her true love to New York City . Aided by an excellent cast , THEY CALL IT SIN is a superior soap opera which delivers just enough sentiment & humor to keep the attention of most viewers . While the heroine's change of affection in the final scene is never really explained , this doesn't detract from the overall enjoyment of the film . Particularly commendable are the sequences set in the Merton park , with the softly playing ukulele setting a gentle romantic mood . Beautiful Loretta Young is radiant as the sweet young thing who follows her dreams to the Big City . Doe-eyed & innocent , her purity is nicely countered by brassy , sassy Una Merkel , cartwheeling through her role as a chorus girl who doesn't take nonsense from anyone . Suave doctor George Brent & earnest businessman David Manners are both very fine in their roles as the fellows who adore Miss Young . Helen Vinson plays Manners ' wealthy fiancée . Elizabeth Patterson scores in her small role as Miss Young's spiteful ? mother . ' Louis Calhern plays the proper scoundrel as a lecherous theatrical producer . Movie mavens will recognize an uncredited Roscoe Karns as a sarcastic dance rehearsal director . Marion Byron delivers some funny moments as the Merton soda jerk .
A Duck Tale With a Stinger	A Walt Disney DONALD DUCK Cartoon . HONEY HARVESTER Donald discovers where Buzz-Buzz the bee has stored his secret , sticky horde . . . This is an enjoyable little film , despite the fact that Disney used the same basic plot - Donald versus a tiny creature - many times . Buzz-Buzz appeared in seven Disney cartoons - much to Donald's intense discomfiture - from 1948 until 1952 . Clarence " Ducky " Nash supplies Donald's voice . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew figures on the sides of his vehicle .

John Ford's First Epic Look At American West	A young boy grows to fulfill his murdered father's vision of seeing THE IRON HORSE , the mighty transcontinental railway , stitch the country together , binding East to West . Bursting with excitement & patriotic fervor , THE IRON HORSE is the film which put young director John Ford on the cinematic map . He brought together all he had learned from years of making shorter , smaller films and he produced a product which heralded his enormous contributions to sound films in the years to come . This is a ' director's picture ' in that the stars , as good as they are , are almost negligible ; what was important here was Ford's vision & his ability to place it before the audience . Indeed , he does not even bring his leading man ( George O'Brien ) on screen until 45 minutes into the story - a shortcut to disaster almost anywhere else . ( In all fairness it should be noted that O'Brien , handsome & strong-limbed , does very well as the gentle hero . He would find similar roles in other epic films of the decade . J . Farrell MacDonald , as Irish Corporal Casey , is the prototype for many comically eccentric fellows who would appear in other Ford westerns . ) The film often takes on the aspects of an ancient newsreel . Cattle drives , Indian attacks & endless track laying all look utterly real . Particularly fascinating is the depiction of the dismantlement of the end-of-the-track town , so that not even a dog is left , as it is moved many miles further on to the west . This type of arcane information is what makes watching very old films so enjoyable . THE IRON HORSE represented the largest migration out of Hollywood for location shooting up to that time . Nothing like this had been attempted before , so Ford & his lieutenants were forced to make up the rules as they went along . Hiring a circus train , the small army of extras arrived at the subzero Nevada location in January of 1924 . The conditions which greeted them were authentically primitive . It was so cold , the extras quickly began sleeping in their costumes . Finding the train to be flea ridden , they moved into the sets and began living exactly as the characters they were portraying . The female extras especially suffered from the rugged conditions . A frontier mindset seemed to take over many of the cast & crew ; the circus tent , which doubled as both the movie saloon and the crew's commissary , eventually had to have the catsup bottles removed from the tables to discourage the many fights which kept breaking out . Authenticity found its way into the movie in other , more positive , ways . Several of the elderly Chinese extras , representing laborers on the Central Pacific , had actually worked on the real McCoy sixty years previous . They came out of retirement to appear in the film & enjoyed themselves immensely . Ford also managed to locate the two original locomotives which met at Promontory Point , Utah , in 1869 and reunited them for the film's climax . Composer John Lanchbery has contributed a splendid soundtrack to the restored video version , incorporating several contemporaneous tunes of the period . It would be intriguing to double bill THE IRON HORSE with Cecil B . DeMille's UNION PACIFIC ( 1939 ) , which tells the same historical story , but with a completely different tack & set of fictional characters .
Fun With Hammer & Brush	A Walt Disney GOOFY Movie . The Goof's HOME MADE HOME is a model of construction chaos . This late entry in Goofy's How To series of cartoons has its humorous moments as he battles with blueprints , glazing & painting . This is one fellow you definitely don't want to hire to build your new bungalow . John McLeish narrates in his best documentarian manner . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by pictures & drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew comic figures on the sides of his vehicle . Back in Kansas City , along with artist Ub Iwerks , Walt developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated commercials and tiny cartoons for the local movie theaters . Always the innovator , his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series broke ground in placing a live figure in a cartoon universe .

When a mildly successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was snatched away by the distributor , the character of Mickey Mouse sprung into Walt's imagination , ensuring Disney's immortality . The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's screen debut , STEAMBOAT WILLIE ( 1928 ) , a tremendous audience success with its use of synchronized music . The SILLY SYMPHONIES soon appeared , and Walt's growing crew of marvelously talented animators were quickly conquering new territory with full color , illusions of depth and radical advancements in personality development , an arena in which Walt's genius was unbeatable .

The Female Of The Species Is More Deadly Than The Male	Sherlock Holmes matches wits with THE SPIDER WOMAN , a fiendish femme fatale responsible for a series of ingenious London murders . Holmes & Watson face one of their most dangerous enemies in this highly enjoyable little crime mystery . Angry arachnids , toxic gas , Hitler's deadly heart and a very sinister little boy are only some of the elements Holmes must contend with in order to solve the latest crime spree to baffle the Metropolitan Police . Behind it all is the malice of a clever , cruel & cunning woman who gleefully challenges the great detective to do his best to stop her . The movie is not without its faults . The brief running time and abrupt conclusion are unfortunate , and the ultimate reason for all the murders is really not all that exciting , but the vivid characters and dangerous adventure more than compensate for the film's shortcomings . Basil Rathbone & Nigel Bruce remain perfect in their leading roles . Rathbone obviously relished playing the cerebral genius and he gets to spice out his characterization with a couple of dead-on disguises . Bumbling Bruce only grows more lovable with each passing film , playing his part with fierce loyalty as well as charming naiveté . Oscar winning actress Gale Sondergaard portrays the title role with deadly feline guile , teasing Holmes the way a cat plays with a mouse . Alec Craig & Arthur Hohl steal a few screen moments as eccentric entomologists . Back for their recurring roles are Dennis Hoey as dogged Inspector Lestrade and dear Mary Gordon as Mrs . Hudson . This film - - which was based on wisps of plot from Conan Doyle'sThe Final Problem , The Empty House , The Speckled Band , The Sign of Four , and The Devil's Foot - - followed SHERLOCK HOLMES FACES DEATH ( 1943 ) and preceded THE SCARLET CLAW ( 1944 ) . Miss Sondergaard reprised her villainous role two years later in THE SPIDER WOMAN STRIKES BACK ( 1946 ) .
Charming Romantic Fantasy	When a haunted Scottish castle is dismantled and removed to Florida THE GHOST GOES WEST , too . Made under the auspices of producer Sir Alexander Korda , acclaimed director René Clair & distinguished author Robert E . Sherwood , here is a fine little film - - very popular in its day - - for thoughtful intellects , about things which go bump in the night . Or , rather , one thing in particular : a kilted phantom doomed to stalk his ancestral castle until his family's honour is avenged - - irregardless of the actual physical location of his old stones , or whatever romantic complications may ensue . Handsome Robert Donat brings just the right amount of sophisticated humor to the dual roles of the ghost and his 20th century descendant . The lovely Jean Parker is splendid as an American rich girl very happy to take the Highlands real estate if Mr . Donat comes along with it . Playing her father , Eugene Palette exhibits both bluster & bemusement as the merchant grocer determined on buying old Glourie Castle , ghost and all . Morton Selten & Hay Petrie have amusing short roles as clan lairds who are fierce antagonists . The marvelous Elsa Lanchester appears far too briefly at the film's conclusion as a paranormal enthusiast . Acknowledgment should go to Vincent Korda for his atmospheric sets . And just what is the difference betwixt a thistle in the heather & a kiss in the dark ?
Chasing Romance With Mr . Lloyd	Although painfully GIRL SHY , a tailor's assistant uses every ounce of strength to keep the young woman he adores from an unwise marriage . Harold Lloyd produces another winning entry in his series of silent screen comedy classics . This time there is a healthy dose of old-fashioned romanticism , as Harold and beautiful Jobyna Ralston yearn & commune alongside a bucolic stream . Such tenderness never cloys , however , as Lloyd makes sure to leaven it with healthy helpings of hilarity . His attempts to hide a small dog on a passenger train are uproarious , as are his demonstrations on how to make love to vamps & flappers . And when the viewer thinks Harold can't possibly top himself , he ends the film with one of his marvelous chase scenes , in which he uses every sort of conveyance ( train , jalopy , horse , fire truck , trolley , motorcycle & sand wagon ) to stop Jobyna's marriage to a cad . Throughout , Harold displays the remarkable athleticism for which he was celebrated , made even more astonishing when one remembers that he had lost half of his right hand a few years before in a freak studio accident , a disfigurement he disguised with a prosthetic glove . Movie mavens will recognize some OUR GANG kids in uncredited roles - - Fat Joe Cobb & Jackie Condon in the tailor's shop and Mickey Daniels as a newsboy on the street . Jim Parker has composed an excellent film score which perfectly complements Harold's antics on the screen .
Lewis Carroll's Creation Comes Alive	A young girl in Victorian England suddenly finds herself drawn into a kingdom where absurdity rules & illogic is the theme of the day . Bemused by the antics of the strange inhabitants of the place , ALICE IN WONDERLAND continues to keep her dignity & wits about her . This movie has received a great deal of criticism down through the decades , mainly because it was considered to be a travesty of Lewis Carroll's classic books . But this is to miss the point of the film . It was never meant to be Art . Pure & simple , it was the chance for Paramount to showcase as many of its stars as possible in a light , enjoyable 1933 Christmas release , giving each their moment to shine in front of the cameras . In this it succeeds quite nicely . The Carroll stories , with their colorful , bizarre characters , have always been a favorite for celebrity cameos : the short , vivid roles are real attention grabbers , but require only a minimum investment of time from the majority of the actors . Great care was taken to be faithful to Carroll's original works and a certain demarcation was respected between Wonderland & the Looking-Glass Country ( although the transition between the two , with the Gryphon metamorphosing into the Red Queen , is rather awkward . ) The elaborate make-up , costumes , masks , puppets & animation strives to resemble Sir John Tenniel's famous drawings . Paramount at least deserves high marks for their visual display . In a role difficult by any stretch of the imagination , young Charlotte Henry does very well as Alice , utilizing the character's spunk & determination in holding her own against a supporting cast of seasoned veterans and inveterate scene stealers . Spirited & charming , with few hints visible of Victorian decorum , she is never boring . ( Ida Lupino was first slated to play Alice , but upon arrival in Hollywood from England the nabobs at Paramount decided she was too mature for the role . Stardom would have to wait for Miss Lupino . ) W . C . Fields has received much acclaim for his performance as Humpty Dumpty , and , indeed , his raspy voice & personality fit the character perfectly , but Edward Everett Horton's Mad Hatter and May Robson's Queen of Hearts are equally enjoyable - perhaps more so , as we can see their facial expressions . ( Listen closely during the penultimate banquet scene to hear Fields ' voice again . ) Several of the stars - Leon Errol , Louise Fazenda , Ford Sterling for example - are all but forgotten now , while others ( Ned Sparks , Roscoe Ates , Roscoe Karns ) are in danger of obscurement , but that shouldn't diminish from their contribution to the overall fun . And where else will you find the likes of Cary Grant , Gary Cooper , Richard Arlen , Edna May Oliver , Polly Moran & Alison Skipworth all gathered for one grand romp ? This was a once-in-a-lifetime cast . Movie mavens will recognize the shamefully uncredited Ethel Griffies as Alice's governess and tiny Billy Barty as both the White Pawn and the Duchess's baby . And although he receives cast credit , Baby Le Roy's turn as the Joker lasts only a few scant seconds . For children of all ages & those with an uncritical appreciation of old films , ALICE IN WONDERLAND has much to offer .
A Little Hoodoo	An RKO-Pathe Screenliner Short Subject . The nervous have more things to fret about than just the BLACK CATS AND BROOMSTICKS of Halloween . This humorous little film takes a lighthearted look at fortune predictors ( Ouija boards , horoscopes , palmistry , etc . ) as well as various superstitions : spilling salt , walking under ladders , Friday the 13th , luck charms , chain letters and so forth . Often overlooked or neglected today , the one and two-reel short subjects were useful to the Studios as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents , both in front & behind the camera . The dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film , something akin to writing a topnotch short story rather than a novel . Economical to produce in terms of both budget & schedule and capable of portraying a wide range of material , short subjects were the perfect complement to the Studios ' feature films .
Tale of courage worth seeing . . .	Although it pales next to the 1939 classic version , as a made-for-television feature this film is well worth watching . It tells the story of a young Englishman driven to extreme lengths to prove to himself & his friends that he is not a coward . Surrounded by a fine British cast , Beau Bridges might seem wrongly cast in the main role , but he does a stalwart job throughout . Good action scenes set in Muslim Africa . Co-stars include Jane Seymour , Harry Andrews ( great as Bridges ' fierce old father ) , Robert Powell , Richard Johnson , Simon Ward , David Robb & Robin Bailey .
Old MacDisney Had A Farm . . .	A Walt Disney SILLY SYMPHONY Cartoon Short . The FARMYARD SYMPHONY signals the start of another day for the farm animals . Baby colts & calves frolic & scamper , the rooster plights his noisy troth to a svelte hen , and a young pig searches for more food . Set to an amalgam of classic music , this cartoon is short on plot & long on charm . The animals are all well rendered ; in fact , it's fascinating to compare this film to earlier entries in the Symphonies and see just how far the Disney animators had progressed in depicting lifelike farm fauna . It sounds like Clarence Nash & Florence Gill are vocalizing for the ducks & chickens . The SILLY SYMPHONIES , which Walt Disney produced for a ten year period beginning in 1929 , are among the most interesting of series in the field of animation . Unlike the Mickey Mouse cartoons in which action was paramount , with the Symphonies the action was made to fit the music . There was little plot in the early Symphonies , which featured lively inanimate objects and anthropomorphic plants & animals , all moving frantically to the soundtrack . Gradually , however , the Symphonies became the school where Walt's animators learned to work with color and began to experiment with plot , characterization & photographic special effects . The pages of Fable & Fairy Tale , Myth & Mother Goose were all mined to provide story lines and even Hollywood's musicals & celebrities were effectively spoofed . It was from this rich soil that Disney's feature-length animation was to spring . In 1939 , with SNOW WHITE successfully behind him and PINOCCHIO & FANTASIA on the near horizon , Walt phased out the SILLY SYMPHONIES ; they had run their course & served their purpose .
A Christmas Jewel From Edwin S . Porter & Thomas Alva Edison	' Twas THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS and all through the house not a creature was stirring , not even a mouse . . . The wonderful old poem by Clement C . Moore comes to life in this little silent film . Looking like a Victorian Christmas card , it has all the charm of a bygone era . The special effects , especially the scenic diorama used for St . Nicholas ' ride , are quite effective . Al Kryszak provided the score for the video compilation A Christmas Past , in which this film appears .
Stalking The Elusive Pimpernel	Hidden behind the nom de guerre of THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL , an English lord attempts to snatch a few victims away from Robespierre's insatiable guillotine . The Scarlet Pimpernel , the French Revolution's greatest enemy , first came to life in a 1903 play by the Baroness Orczy and in her subsequent , and almost unreadable , 1905 novel . He was an immediate favorite with both the British & American public and found his finest translation to screen in this lavish movie from Sir Alexander Korda's London Films . It's interesting that the film actually became so popular , because there is very little action in it . It begins with an exciting rescue & escape from dangerous Paris , but then it settles in for lengthy dialogues in English parlors and ballrooms . Even the conclusion , with its confrontation between hero and villain , is civilized and bloodless . The bulk of the story is actually a melodrama enacted principally by a trio of characters : an English husband who believes his Parisian wife has betrayed the Gallic nobility he so loves , she frets that he has lost every scintilla of masculinity , and the French serpent in their midst plots to destroy their entire Eden . The reason the film clicks is because it is so very well written ( celebrated American playwright Robert Sherwood worked on the script ) and acted . Sensitive Leslie Howard is perfectly cast as courageous Sir Percy Blakeney , who must wear a double disguise , that of the Pimpernel to fool the French , and as a complete aristocratic ass to dupe his wife , Marguerite . She is played by the exotic Merle Oberon ; the script allows her to do little more than look frightened or confused , but she does both very nicely . Raymond Massey is properly wicked as the sneering Chauvelin , Revolutionary ambassador and master spy , who desperately desires to capture the Pimpernel . In the large cast it's often a mite difficult to sort out who's who , but a few fine character actors particularly stand out : Nigel Bruce as a stout & pompous Prince of Wales , Bramwell Fletcher as a French priest aiding the Pimpernel , and Melville Cooper as George Romney , the celebrated portraitist , who has to endure a silly critique from Sir Percy . The Baroness Emmuska Magdalena Rosalia Marie Josepha Barbara Orczy ( 1865-1947 ) was a most prolific author with a list of books almost as lengthy as her name . Those wishing to follow the further clashes between Sir Percy and Chauvelin may do so in the many sequels , now mostly quite obscure , which she penned over the next several decades : I Will Repay ( 1906 ) , The Elusive Pimpernel ( 1908 ) , El Dorado ( 1913 ) , Lord Tony's Wife ( 1917 ) , The League Of The Scarlet Pimpernel ( 1919 ) , The Triumph Of The Scarlet Pimpernel ( 1922 ) , Sir Percy Hits Back ( 1927 ) , Adventures Of The Scarlet Pimpernel ( 1929 ) , The Way Of The Scarlet Pimpernel ( 1933 ) , The Scarlet Pimpernel Looks At The World ( 1933 ) , Child Of The Revolution ( 1933 ) , Sir Percy Leads The Band ( 1936 ) and Mam'zelle Guillotine ( 1940 ) . The scarlet pimpernel ( Anagallis arvensis ) is a low spreading herb with a 5-peteled blossom that grows as a weed throughout Northern Europe . The flower closes at rain's approach and opens again with returning sunshine , hence giving rise to its being called ' the poor-man's weatherglass ' or ' the shepherd's barometer . '
Quality Retelling Of Classic Tale	Two small creatures have separate , but equally exciting , adventures - one on a lily pond , the other in a farmer's vegetable garden . Paired together on one video , Beatrix Potter's classic stories THE TALE OF MR . JEREMY FISHER & THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT make for excellent viewing . The quiet , faithful retelling by the folks at Rabbit Ears is sure to delight children of all ages . Meryl Streep's calm , elegant narration , along with David Jorgensen's pastel drawings & Lyle Mays friendly music , do much to enhance the success of this little film .
A Flustered Duck Tale	A Walt Disney DONALD DUCK Cartoon . Visiting the old Bar-None Ranch , Donald the DUDE DUCK has his hands full in just getting his assigned horse , Rover Boy # 6 , to give him a ride . The main enjoyment in this little film comes from watching Donald's growing impatience at not getting the horseback riding he's obviously paid for . The Disney artists used the rotoscope technique in portraying the human young ladies as they arrive at the Ranch . Although he gave a frisky performance , this would be Rover Boy's only appearance in a Disney cartoon . Clarence " Ducky " Nash supplied Donald with his unique voice . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew figures on the sides of his vehicle . Back in Kansas City , along with artist Ub Iwerks , Walt developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated commercials and tiny cartoons for the local movie theaters . Always the innovator , his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series broke ground in placing a live figure in a cartoon universe . Business reversals sent Disney & Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923 , where Walt's older brother Roy became his lifelong business manager & counselor . When a mildly successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was snatched away by the distributor , the character of Mickey Mouse sprung into Walt's imagination , ensuring Disney's immortality . The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's screen debut , STEAMBOAT WILLIE ( 1928 ) , a tremendous audience success with its use of synchronized music . The SILLY SYMPHONIES soon appeared , and Walt's growing crew of marvelously talented animators were quickly conquering new territory with full color , illusions of depth and radical advancements in personality development , an arena in which Walt's genius was unbeatable . Mickey's feisty , naughty behavior had captured millions of fans , but he was soon to be joined by other animated companions : temperamental Donald Duck , intellectually-challenged Goofy and energetic Pluto . All this was in preparation for Walt's grandest dream - feature length animated films . Against a blizzard of doomsayers , Walt persevered and over the next decades delighted children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White , Pinocchio , Dumbo , Bambi & Peter Pan . Walt never forgot that his fortunes were all started by a mouse , or that simplicity of message and lots of hard work always pay off .
Spirited Examination Of An Arctic Radar Installation	An RKO-PATHÉ Short Subject . Standing near the top of the world , silent & strong , the POLAR OUTPOST is but one of a string of fortresses waiting for the approach of the flying enemy . Ever vigilant , armed to the teeth , its mere presence allows peaceful Americans & Canadians to sleep well , knowing that their airborne bodyguard never slumbers . This well-made & exciting 1957 documentary gave many North Americans their first look at the remarkable DEW ( Distant Early Warning ) Line , the air bases maintained near the Arctic Circle , in full cooperation between America & Canada , to guard against possible air attack over the North Pole from the Soviet Union . The film looks at the development of one typical base , as seen through the letter home of American Air Force Captain Richard Crane , from the initial selection of the site - right down to the eventual output of its bountiful kitchen . Some of the difficulties in maintaining a modern military community under such harsh environmental conditions are also examined . Made with the full cooperation of the United States Air Force , Eisenhower Era audiences were reminded by POLAR OUTPOST how their defense tax dollars were being well spent .
Mickey Mouse , The Motor Menace	A Walt Disney MICKEY MOUSE Cartoon . Mickey's TRAFFIC TROUBLES begin when he lets an extremely obese customer into his taxi . This is a fun black & white cartoon , although The Mouse is allowed to be rather cruel to the weaker animals he meets . The frantic , amply uddered bovine he encounters may be an early version of Clarabelle Cow . Peg-leg Pete & Minnie have small roles . Walt Disney supplies the voice for Mickey . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew figures on the sides of his vehicle .

Lickety-split !	An MGM SPORT CHAMPIONS Short Subject . Yachtsmen of a very special breed gather from all over America for a most unusual DESERT REGATTA . This fascinating little film from a bygone era shows the outboard motor speed record races which took place on Southern California's great Salton Sea , where even rocks float . The care & treatment of the small craft under these very harsh conditions is examined . The grueling race itself is shown , with the mood lightened by a dose of camera trickery . Pete Smith is the unconventional narrator . Often overlooked or neglected today , the one and two-reel short subjects were useful to the Studios as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents , both in front & behind the camera . The dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film , something akin to writing a topnotch short story rather than a novel . Economical to produce in terms of both budget & schedule and capable of portraying a wide range of material , short subjects were the perfect complement to the Studios ' feature films .
Marion Davies ' Finest Role	In order to gain a huge inheritance , young Margaret ( her father's PEG O ' MY HEART ) leaves her fishing village in the West of Ireland to live with an impoverished , but insufferable , noble family in England . This wonderful , heartwarming - although sadly neglected - film boasts a winning performance from the most misunderstood star of Hollywood's Golden Age . Marion Davies is delightfully playful and quite captivating , easily dominating her every scene . A natural mimic , Davies ' Irish brogue is natural & lilting , adding a further dimension to her entrancing character . For viewers unfamiliar with her expertise , Davies will come as a welcome surprise . In the supporting cast , J . Farrell MacDonald takes first honors as Davies ' father ; he is completely believable as a tenderhearted old fisherman who sorrowfully gives up his daughter for her own good . Onslow Stevens is well cast as the kind baronet who captures Peg's heart . Alan Mowbray , as a local cad , and Robert Greig , as a stuffy butler , both score in their roles . Tyrell Davis is very amusing as a giddy young gynandroid with absolutely no intentions of wooing Davies . Doris Lloyd as Mowbray's no-nonsense wife , and Nora Cecil as an elderly maid , shine in their cameo appearances . MGM , under the watchful eye of William Randolph Hearst , gave PEG a splendid cinematic treatment , with money lavished most especially on the production values of the fishing village scenes . The movie proved to be a hit with audiences , as was its signature tune ' Sweetheart Darling , ' by Nacio Herb Brown & Arthur Freed . This was Hearst's favorite of all Davies ' films . Although he realized it was time , at age 36 , for her to no longer play 20-year-olds , he campaigned relentlessly that she be given an Academy Award nomination . ( No MGM actresses were nominated that year , as it turns out ; Katharine Hepburn over at RKO got the Oscar . ) Time has not dealt kindly with Marion Davies . Almost forgotten today , when remembered at all it is usually as a sort of footnote to history or object of scandal . Her life certainly was colorful , and as chatelaine of America's most amazing private estate she did circulate amidst powerful circles . But to remember her as the bimbo blonde mistress of the country's mightiest media baron is patently unfair . While much of the blame can go to Orson Welles ' spoof of Davies in CITIZEN KANE ( which he was to admit he regretted towards the end of his life ) it must be stated emphatically that Marion was not a no-talent actress with few friends & even fewer brains , whose career was destroyed by her stammer leaving her to spend lonely years in great , hulking empty castles . In reality , Davies was a bright , vivacious lady who charmed & captivated such diverse guests as George Bernard Shaw & Winston Churchill throughout her 33-year liaison with Hearst . Adored by her friends , and a fierce cadre of fans , Davies was renowned for her tireless generosity and charitable good works . Her speech impediment never affected her screen acting and her undeniable talent was evident to any who were willing to access her performances honesty and look past the scandal . Davies had to have been embarrassed by the Hearst empire's relentless pushing of her career . She knew this left her open to ridicule & mockery , doubtless contributing to her scarcely concealed alcoholism . But she eventually relinquished her film pursuits in order to care for the aging Hearst , and after his death in 1951 she showed herself to be an astute businesswoman during the remaining ten years of her life . It is only now , with the passage of much time & the restoration of her old movies , that it is becoming easier to acknowledge the contributions & cinematic expertise of Marion Davies .
Minnie Blows Her Horn	A Walt Disney MICKEY MOUSE Cartoon . MICKEY'S MECHANICAL MAN , a boxing robot , engages in the Battle of the Century against The Kongo Killer , who's a real ape . This little black & white cartoon is a lot of fun , with The Mouse trying to control his unusual contraption . Good animation throughout . That's Walt supplying Mickey's squeaky voice . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew figures on the sides of his vehicle . Back in Kansas City , along with artist Ub Iwerks , Walt developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated commercials and tiny cartoons for the local movie theaters . Always the innovator , his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series broke ground in placing a live figure in a cartoon universe . Business reversals sent Disney & Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923 , where Walt's older brother Roy became his lifelong business manager & counselor . When a mildly successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was snatched away by the distributor , the character of Mickey Mouse sprung into Walt's imagination , ensuring Disney's immortality . The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's screen debut , STEAMBOAT WILLIE ( 1928 ) , a tremendous audience success with its use of synchronized music . The SILLY SYMPHONIES soon appeared , and Walt's growing crew of marvelously talented animators were quickly conquering new territory with full color , illusions of depth and radical advancements in personality development , an arena in which Walt's genius was unbeatable . Mickey's feisty , naughty behavior had captured millions of fans , but he was soon to be joined by other animated companions : temperamental Donald Duck , intellectually-challenged Goofy and energetic Pluto . All this was in preparation for Walt's grandest dream - feature length animated films . Against a blizzard of doomsayers , Walt persevered and over the next decades delighted children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White , Pinocchio , Dumbo , Bambi & Peter Pan . Walt never forgot that his fortunes were all started by a mouse , or that simplicity of message and lots of hard work always pay off .
Provocative Polemic	While MEN MUST FIGHT wars , it is the women who wait and strive for peace . This is a fascinating film , all but forgotten now , which both pleads for peace yet urges action against violent aggressor nations . By supplying strong characters to voice both sides , sometimes changing their minds mid-film , MEN MUST FIGHT tries to please everyone without alienating anyone . Politics aside , it is possible to enjoy the film strictly on the basis of its good acting and compelling production values . Beginning during World War One , the movie quickly jumps to 1940 , where it tries to predict not only the fashions but also the geopolitics seven years hence from its production . Although the future enemy is called ? Eurasia , ' careful observation during the Coliseum anti-war rally clearly shows the Nazi swastika and the Imperial Japanese Rising Sun flag among the montage of dangers , eight years before America's entry into the still-distant World War Two , proving the prescience of the film's creators . Distinguished English actress Diana Wynyard is a standout as the woman who has seen too much of war's death and tries valiantly to convince others to renounce all warfare . She is well matched by Lewis Stone as her pacifist husband who must rethink his beliefs after high governmental office forces him to confront real dangers . These two excellent performers ably show the full force their decisions have on their most intimate relationships . Phillips Holmes gives a compelling performance as Wynyard's conflicted son - - caught between pacifism & patriotism , he shows the stress going through the mind of any young man facing a really difficult decision . Ironically , considering the film's conclusion , this fine young actor would be killed in a midair collision in Ontario in August of 1942 , preparing to fight the Nazis as a member of the Canadian Air ForceElderly May Robson makes one of her typically energetic film appearances as Lewis ' sharp-tongued mother . Pretty Ruth Selwyn does well with her undemanding role as Holmes ' patriotic fiancée ; stately Hedda Hopper plays her strong-minded mother . Robert Young makes the most of his very brief role as the flier who is the great love of Wynyard's life . Rotund Robert Greig steals a few scenes as Robson's spirited butler . Movie mavens will recognize Arthur Housman as a shipboard inebriate and Mary Gordon as a spectator during the Coliseum rally , both uncredited . The film's pre-Code status is well demonstrated by its gentle mocking of patriotism and the way in which the opening scenes frankly present Wynyard & Young as unmarried lovers .
Visiting England's Halls Of Learning	An MGM TRAVELTALK Short Subject . Our quick tour of SCHOLASTIC ENGLAND begins at Cambridge , continues on to Oxford & concludes at Eton . At all three institutions we see majestic buildings and hear a little about their histories . We conclude with scenes of a student cricket match & punting on the Thames . This is one of a large series of succinct travelogues turned out by MGM , beginning in the 1930's . They featured Technicolor views of beautiful & unusual sights around the globe , as well as vivid , concise commentary . These films were produced & narrated by James A . FitzPatrick .
Turf Trotters	An MGM SPORTS PARADE Short Subject . The training of a young trotter is observed from the time he's a colt until he competes in his first Grand Circuit race . This interesting little film explains the basics of harness horse racing , with emphasis on the trotter . The difference between diagonal verses lateral striding is discussed and the various leg & body accouterments are shown . This was one of the first directing assignments for Jacques Tourneur , who would later make his mark with stylish horror films at RKO . Pete Smith supplies the quirky narration . Often overlooked or neglected today , the one and two-reel short subjects were useful to the Studios as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents , both in front & behind the camera . The dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film , something like writing a topnotch short story rather than a novel . Economical to produce in terms of both budget & schedule and capable of portraying a wide range of material , short subjects were the perfect complement to the Studios ' feature films .
Danger & Duplicity By The Dardanelles	During World War One a notorious German spy , on a STAMBOUL QUEST for naval secrets , finds herself falling in love with a most persistent young American . This enjoyable espionage thriller features plenty of romance and a convoluted plot which will not reward viewers who nap . The story is a mite ludicrous and obviously owes much to the real-life exploits of Mata Hari , who is mentioned but never seen ( footage of her character was deleted ) . The climax seems forced and contrived , as if the Studio was hurrying towards the expected happy ending , but it should please most of the audience irregardless . Myrna Loy plays the beautiful spy who finds her heart overruling her head during a most critical assignment . She engages in no great exhibition of acting skill , but her classically cool demeanor is so sophisticated & glamorous that she is a constant joy to watch . George Brent , over from Warner Bros . , has fun as the exuberant medical student who dogs Loy's footsteps until she can't help but succumb to his charms . Together , they make a pair of playful lovers . Lionel Atwill , an extremely fine actor who's not given the recognition he's due , integrates his usually sinister demeanor with flashes of humor in his role as Germany's spy master . C . Henry Gordon portrays a wily Turkish commander , while the ever versatile Mischa Auer takes on the role of his aide-de-camp . Movie mavens will recognize Leo G . Carroll as a double agent and Christian Rub as a dentist extracting more than bad teeth , both uncredited . The Dardanelles , which is spoken of throughout the film , is the strategic strait connecting the Aegean Sea with the Sea of Marmara , the body of water which separates European from Asiatic Turkey . It should not be confused with the Bosporus , which is further to the East and is the strait which connects the Sea of Marmara with the Black Sea . The famous siege of Gallipoli , in 1915-16 , was Britain's unsuccessful attempt to wrest control of the Dardanelles from the Turkish Empire . The ancient Greek name for the Dardanelles was the Hellespont .
A Duck Tale Of Bygone Days	A Walt Disney DONALD DUCK Cartoon . Donald is certainly CRAZY OVER DAISY , but Chip ' n ' Dale may drive him loony if they don't stop pestering him . The opening sequence of this film , with Donald pedaling about town on his ordinary while whistling the catchy title tune , has an amiable Gay Nineties ambiance ( look fast for cameos from Goofy as an iceman and Mickey & Minnie in an ancient jalopy ) . Once the little rodents arrive on the scene , however , it becomes just another Chipmunk cartoon . Clarence " Ducky " Nash provides Donald with his unique voice . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew figures on the sides of his vehicle .

When a mildly successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was snatched away by the distributor , the character of Mickey Mouse sprung into Walt's imagination , ensuring Disney's immortality . The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's screen debut , STEAMBOAT WILLIE ( 1928 ) , a tremendous audience success with its use of synchronized music . The SILLY SYMPHONIES soon appeared , and Walt's growing crew of marvelously talented animators were quickly conquering new territory with full color , illusions of depth and radical advancements in personality development , an arena in which Walt's genius was unbeatable . Mickey's feisty , naughty behavior had captured millions of fans , but he was soon to be joined by other animated companions : temperamental Donald Duck , intellectually-challenged Goofy and energetic Pluto . All this was in preparation for Walt's grandest dream - feature length animated films . Against a blizzard of doomsayers , Walt persevered and over the next decades delighted children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White , Pinocchio , Dumbo , Bambi & Peter Pan . Walt never forgot that his fortunes were all started by a mouse , or that simplicity of message and lots of hard work always pay off .
A Little Christmas Charmer	On Christmas Eve , SANTA CLAUS beguiles two children with stories of what his life is like the rest of the year . This is a delightfully charming little film , an adroit mixture of nature photography & fantasy . With scenes actually filmed in Northern Alaska , we get to see St . Nick visiting his Eskimo neighbors & surveying his vast reindeer herd . Segments in the Workshop with the Elves are also well done and we finally get the lowdown on how Santa knows who's being naughty or nice . A lot of thought & finances went into creating this Holiday gem . Al Kryszak provided the score for the video compilation A Christmas Past , in which this film appears .
Pratfalls In The Park With Mr . Laurel & Mr . Hardy	A LAUREL & HARDY Comedy Short . Sailors Stan & Ollie , two MEN O'WAR , are on shore leave . While strolling through the park , they meet & escort two silly young women . After a financial contretemps at the soda fountain , the Boys initiate a rowdy donnybrook on the boat pond . A hilarious little film , with a delightful sense of spontaneity , as if the performers were extemporizing much of their dialogue . This short is also refreshing in that the plot takes place entirely out of doors . Highlight : bedlam in the boat . The knickers sequence shows that this film was produced pre-Production Code . That's James Finlayson as the soda fountain / boat rental manager ; Anne Cornwall & Gloria Greer as the young women ; and Charlie Hall as the man in the canoe .
The Dysfunctional Duo Strikes Again	A Walt Disney DONALD AND GOOFY Cartoon . Donald & Goofy , working as BILLPOSTERS , encounter trouble from an angry billy goat and an uncooperative windmill . This is a wonderful , hilarious little film , with excellent animation . It is a fine example of the quality of work the Studio was capable of producing on a small scale , even as it was switching gears to accommodate the simultaneous creation of feature length cartoons . Clarence " Ducky " Nash supplies Donald's unique voice . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew figures on the sides of his vehicle . Back in Kansas City , along with artist Ub Iwerks , Walt developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated commercials and tiny cartoons for the local movie theaters .

When a mildly successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was snatched away by the distributor , the character of Mickey Mouse sprung into Walt's imagination , ensuring Disney's immortality . The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's screen debut , STEAMBOAT WILLIE ( 1928 ) , a tremendous audience success with its use of synchronized music .

Walt never forgot that his fortunes were all started by a mouse , or that simplicity of message and lots of hard work always pay off .
In Search Of The Purest Anglo-Saxon	The sponsors of a rowdy radio singer find a somber PROFESSIONAL SWEETHEART to keep her satisfied and out of trouble . Ginger Rogers dominates this Pre-Code comedy with her saucy performance as the spoiled warbler . This was her first starring role and she makes the most of it , pouting and prancing across the screen ( often in her lingerie ) talking bold & brassy , but actually just longing for the right male to come along and knock her into submission . Disturbing implications aside , she is an eyeful and a great deal of fun to watch . Norman Foster deftly underplays his role as a stolid Tennessee backwoodsman whose whole life is commandeered by Ms . Rogers and the avaricious makers of the Ippsie Wippsie wash cloth . His eventual break for freedom , with Rogers in tow , will elicit deep approval from at least one gender in the viewing audience . A wonderful cast of character actors help support the stars : Gregory Ratoff as Ginger's scheming sponsor ; Frank McHugh as his eager beaver press agent ; ZaSu Pitts as a silly sob sister ; Franklin Pangborn as a nervous decorator ; Edgar Kennedy as owner of a rival wash rag company ; Allen Jenkins as his factotum ; and Sterling Holloway as a slow-talking reporter . Movie mavens will recognize an unbilled Akim Tamiroff as a hotel room service waiter .
Chevalier Shines In Lubitsch Teaser	Domestic difficulties between the strong-willed Queen of Sylvania and her stubborn Consort may cause them both to miss THE LOVE PARADE . Director Ernst Lubitsch spread his special brand of sophisticated naughtiness in this visually impressive & engaging early talkie musical . Depending much on the intelligence of the viewer , the film serves up unexpected bons mons of wit ( e . g . the dog barking his farewells to the pooches of Paris ) which never fail to enchant . Lubitsch would contribute a series of delightful little comedies over the next several years , making the title of this confection pertinent in more ways than one . Maurice Chevalier practically oozes Gaelic charm in a wonderfully hammy , ingratiating performance . His French charisma dominates the screen ; he embraces his songs rather than just singing them . His immense joie de vivre & exceptional talent was perfectly attuned to the sound motion picture . In her film debut , the lovely Jeanette MacDonald proves a charming partner to Chevalier . Imperious or coquettish by turns , she beguiles the viewer as well as Maurice - - her celebrated voice ( when intelligible ) put to good use in the seduction . British physical comedian Lupino Lane is a winner as Chevalier's highly energetic little valet ; lanky Lillian Roth , as a palace maid , joins him for some humorous knockabout songs . Lionel Belmore & Eugene Palette bring appropriately hefty gravitas to their roles as government ministers . Diminutive Edgar Norton appears as an unflappable majordomo . Movie mavens will recognize silent screen comic Ben Turpin as a cross-eyed lackey , Russ Powell as the Afghan Ambassador and young Jean Harlow as one of a group of women applauding Chevalier at the theatre , all uncredited .
Opulent Tale Of Old London Town	A bright young lad goes to work at LLOYD'S OF London , the famous insurance house . He grows up to become a power in the institution , with much adventure & financial intrigue along the way , but love continues to elude him . . . This lavish film is great fun to watch for two primary reasons : some very good acting & the history of Lloyd's , preeminent in its field , which it details . 20th Century Fox obviously spent a pretty penny on the production values , and it shows . Freddie Bartholomew has top billing and effortlessly steals the first half hour of the film . When his character grows up , Master Bartholomew is sorely missed . He turns into Tyrone Power , who is billed fourth . This was the film that made Power a star , and he's quite effective in the role , if you overlook the American accent . An excellent supporting cast lends a hand : wonderful old Sir Guy Standing as Power's mentor at Lloyd's - this powerful actor would soon have his life cut short by a rattlesnake bite ; Una O'Connor as Bartholomew's harridan aunt ; Montagu Love as a duplicitous pirate ; obese Robert Greig as the jocular First Lord of the Admiralty ; E . E . Clive as a dyspeptic magistrate ; oily George Sanders as a noble cad ; and marvelous old Sir C . Aubrey Smith as a flirtatious peer . The romantic subplot is ludicrous : Power moons over beautiful , married Madeleine Carroll for 20 years , while pert barmaid Virginia Field pines for him ; none of them so much as gain a wrinkle or an extra ounce during this time . The film earns high marks in its generally faithful depiction of the history both of Lloyd's , and of Horatio Nelson .
A Peep At Old Los Angeles	An MGM TRAVELTALK Short Subject . Our whirlwind visit to LOS ANGELES , WONDER CITY OF THE WEST , begins at the Old Spanish Plaza , where the settlement was founded . A stroll down colorful Olvera Street shows us the reconstructed Mexican marketplace . After looking at some of the modern structures along Wilshire Boulevard , we are treated to a quick glimpse at examples of wacky Southern California architecture - the Chinese Theatre , the Brown Derby & the Blue Mill . The impressive backlot at MGM Studios is followed by a meeting with one of America's most famous men , Walt Disney . The dramatic Hollywood Bowl is our final destination during our day in The City of the Angels . This is one of a large series of succinct travelogues turned out by MGM , beginning in the 1930's . They featured Technicolor views of beautiful & unusual sights around the globe , as well as vivid , concise commentary . These films were produced & narrated by James A . FitzPatrick .
Mr . George Arliss Will Personally Check The Air In Your Tires	Health problems force an elderly auto tycoon into retirement . Refusing to stay idle , he buys half ownership into a service station & gleefully begins to work there , incognito . The old man is now able to help his young partner in matters of business & romance . But what will happen if he's discovered to be , in reality , THE MILLIONAIRE ? George Arliss was a wonderful actor , now sadly neglected . The merest glance , the smallest movement of his hands , the raised eyebrow or vocal inflection , these all spoke volumes . Here , he has a fine outlet for his artistry . The film moves right along , without any dull moments , fueled by the fun of watching Arliss act . He is given good support by David Manners ( a fine leading man of the 1930's ) as his partner ; Noah Beery as a beefy business rival ; and real-life wife Florence Arliss . James Cagney , not quite yet a star , breezes in for a few moments as an insurance agent who gives Arliss some good advice . Effortlessly , he steals the scene from Arliss ( the old man seems amused ) , a very rare event , indeed .
Miss Blondell & Mister William Invite You To Join Them In A Bit Of Comic Relief	It's GOODBYE AGAIN as a loyal secretary tries to help her weak-willed , philandering boss out of the romantic complications caused by an old girlfriend , now married . This was the sort of ephemeral comic frippery which the studios produced almost effortlessly during the 1930's . Well made & highly enjoyable , Depression audiences couldn't seem to get enough of these popular , funny photo dramas . Joan Blondell & Warren William are perfectly matched as a memorable comedy team . She was the great Hard Times sassy , brassy blonde who always got her man , no matter what travail or comic bumps she encountered along the way . Nearly forgotten now , William is best remembered for the hard-boiled , cynical tycoons & shysters he played to perfection . It is great fun to see him essay light comedy . Wacky , whimsical Hugh Herbert appears as a blithely unconcerned cuckold . Whether stalking his faithless spouse through trains & hotels or gleefully pushing for a divorce , he is equally hilarious . Behind him comes a rank of character actors - Genevieve Tobin , Wallace Ford , Helen Chandler , Hobart Cavanaugh , Ruth Donnelly - all equally adept at catching the comedy in the story line . Much of the dialogue & plot is vintage pre-Production Code material .
Disney's Excursion To Nursery Rhyme Land	A Walt Disney SILLY SYMPHONY Cartoon Short . Old King Cole has arrived for an outdoor entertainment . The MOTHER GOOSE MELODIES begin when the old dame opens her book of Nursery Rhymes and several characters appear to perform for the King . An interesting little film , with much action for eye appeal . It is fun to spot & identify the various characters . Clarabelle Cow has a couple of cameo appearances , first bestrewing the King's path with petals ; later she plays the part of the Cow That Jumped Over The Moon . Disney would remake this cartoon in color - as OLD KING COLE - three years later . The SILLY SYMPHONIES , which Walt Disney produced for a ten year period beginning in 1929 , are among the most interesting of series in the field of animation . Unlike the Mickey Mouse cartoons in which action was paramount , with the Symphonies the action was made to fit the music . There was little plot in the early Symphonies , which featured lively inanimate objects and anthropomorphic plants & animals , all moving frantically to the soundtrack . Gradually , however , the Symphonies became the school where Walt's animators learned to work with color and began to experiment with plot , characterization & photographic special effects . The pages of Fable & Fairy Tale , Myth & Mother Goose were all mined to provide story lines and even Hollywood's musicals & celebrities were effectively spoofed . It was from this rich soil that Disney's feature-length animation was to spring . In 1939 , with SNOW WHITE successfully behind him and PINOCCHIO & FANTASIA on the near horizon , Walt phased out the SILLY SYMPHONIES ; they had run their course & served their purpose .
Pluto Shows Off	A Walt Disney PLUTO Cartoon . Jealous of Dinah the dachshund's adoration of Prince the WONDER DOG , Pluto tries to impress her with his own pathetic skills - which in turn attracts the unwanted attentions of Butch the bully bulldog . This humorous little film marked the final appearances by both Dinah & Butch . While Pluto always was the romantic winner in his cartoons , it is just possible that his two canine costars discovered puppy love with each other and took a joint early retirement . The celebrated Bill Peet was one of the writers of this cartoon . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew figures on the sides of his vehicle . Back in Kansas City , along with artist Ub Iwerks , Walt developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated commercials and tiny cartoons for the local movie theaters . Always the innovator , his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series broke ground in placing a live figure in a cartoon universe . Business reversals sent Disney & Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923 , where Walt's older brother Roy became his lifelong business manager & counselor . When a mildly successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was snatched away by the distributor , the character of Mickey Mouse sprung into Walt's imagination , ensuring Disney's immortality . The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's screen debut , STEAMBOAT WILLIE ( 1928 ) , a tremendous audience success with its use of synchronized music . The SILLY SYMPHONIES soon appeared , and Walt's growing crew of marvelously talented animators were quickly conquering new territory with full color , illusions of depth and radical advancements in personality development , an arena in which Walt's genius was unbeatable . Mickey's feisty , naughty behavior had captured millions of fans , but he was soon to be joined by other animated companions : temperamental Donald Duck , intellectually-challenged Goofy and energetic Pluto . All this was in preparation for Walt's grandest dream - feature length animated films . Against a blizzard of doomsayers , Walt persevered and over the next decades delighted children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White , Pinocchio , Dumbo , Bambi & Peter Pan . Walt never forgot that his fortunes were all started by a mouse , or that simplicity of message and lots of hard work always pay off .
Color Classic	Pretty BECKY SHARP , orphaned & penniless , knows exactly what she wants out of life and how to get it . William Makepeace Thackeray's Vanity Fair is brought to vivid , if drastically reduced , life and provides a wonderful showcase for star Miriam Hopkins , who gets the most out of her selfish , petulant , scheming , desperate character . Her Becky is fascinating to watch and dominates nearly every scene in the film , making us forget that the actress is not English and forgive that the character is rather less than virtuous . Miss Hopkins is aided by a sizable cast of seasoned veterans , mostly British , several of whom only appear in a single scene . Frances Dee has very little to do except look lovely as Becky's school chum . Nigel Bruce comes off rather better as Miss Dee's obese brother who adores Becky . The incomparable Alison Skipworth plays their quarrelsome old aunt who hires Becky for a short while . Alan Mowbray has a fine romantic role as the husband who worships Becky , to his pain . Marvelous Sir Cedric Hardwicke successfully underplays his role as a powerful nobleman who takes Becky as his mistress . Wonderful Billie Burke appears for a few moments in a serious role as a society lady attending a soirée in Brussels . Doris Lloyd is the hostess . Three short , sharp portrayals worth watching for are provided by Elspeth Dudgeon as an acidic girls ' school proprietress ; George Hassell as a rascally old baronet ; and Tempe Pigott as a plain-talking charwoman . BECKY SHARP is important historically in that it was the first film produced in full 3-strip Technicolor . Director Rouben Mamoulian's opulent production was a worthy choice for such a distinguished accolade . Restored in the 1990's , the color is once again most pleasing to the eye .
Splendid Oscar-Winning Disney Nature Documentary	A Walt Disney TRUE-LIFE ADVENTURE Short Subject . Through the use of beautiful photography , this Academy Award-winning film looks at the strange & colorful lives of the WATER BIRDS . Several species are examined and the ways in which they have habituated themselves to seashore , lake or stream are noted . Highlight : the rhapsodic finale . ' This is one of a series of TRUE-LIFE ADVENTURES presenting strange facts about the world we live in . In the making of these films , nature is the dramatist . There are no fictitious situations or characters . ' Winston Hibler is the narrator .
Harkening To The Voice Of Child Psychology	A Walt Disney DONALD DUCK Cartoon . Donald receives compelling advice to SPARE THE ROD in dealing with his Nephews ' bad behavior and , instead , join in their games . Here is another little film in which Donald matches wits with Huey , Dewey & Louie - a plot line which Disney had been using for the better part of two decades at this point . Even so , it's fairly entertaining , largely due to Donald's never boring personality . Clarence Nash provides the voices for the entire Duck clan . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by pictures & drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew comic figures on the sides of his vehicle . Back in Kansas City , along with artist Ub Iwerks , Walt developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated commercials and tiny cartoons for the local movie theaters . Always the innovator , his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series broke ground in placing a live figure in a cartoon universe . Business reversals sent Disney & Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923 , where Walt's older brother Roy became his lifelong business manager & counselor . When a mildly successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was snatched away by the distributor , the character of Mickey Mouse sprung into Walt's imagination , ensuring Disney's immortality . The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's screen debut , STEAMBOAT WILLIE ( 1928 ) , a tremendous audience success with its use of synchronized music . The SILLY SYMPHONIES soon appeared , and Walt's growing crew of marvelously talented animators were quickly conquering new territory with full color , illusions of depth and radical advancements in personality development , an arena in which Walt's genius was unbeatable . Mickey's feisty , naughty behavior had captured millions of fans , but he was soon to be joined by other animated companions : temperamental Donald Duck , intellectually-challenged Goofy and energetic Pluto . All this was in preparation for Walt's grandest dream - feature length animated films . Against a blizzard of doomsayers , Walt persevered and over the next decades delighted children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White , Pinocchio , Dumbo , Bambi & Peter Pan . Walt never forgot that his fortunes were all started by a mouse , or that childlike simplicity of message and lots of hard work always pay off .
Karloff Most Effective In Psychological Thriller	In 1912 , a stern old Greek general finds himself trapped on the ISLE OF THE DEAD after an outbreak of the dreaded plague . When the front office at RKO Pictures informed producer Val Lewton that Boris Karloff had been procured to appear in his next suspense film , he wasn't entirely pleased . Karloff was famous for his portrayal of horrific monsters & mummies , sensationalist creations not at all in tune with the psychological thrillers for which Lewton was noted - - with very low budgets , he was able to fashion fascinating films in which the atmosphere was every bit as important as the plot . Luckily , Karloff turned out to be an inspired choice . Determined to show that he was a skilled actor ( actually , he was a very fine & talented performer ) he was completely in sync with what Lewton envisaged , giving a nuanced portrayal of an essentially decent man who finds himself slowly driven to a sort of despair by the forces around him . He becomes the heart of a film which wisely saves its shocks for the last few minutes , having built up to the eerie climax slowly & inexorably . Lewton was very pleased with Karloff's work and arranged two more collaborations . With only two weeks left in filming ISLE OF THE DEAD , Karloff had to be hospitalized for serious back problems . On his release from hospital , he found Lewton was all prepared to film THE BODY SNATCHER ( 1945 ) . Karloff gave another wonderful performance , before finally finishing ISLE OF THE DEAD . The following year Karloff starred in Lewton's BEDLAM ( 1946 ) , completing the trio of very tidy thrillers . Karloff's co-stars give him good support , especially Ernst Deutsch as a military doctor ; Alan Napier & Katherine Emery as a British consul and his invalid wife ; Helen Thimig as a superstitious Greek peasant ; and little Skelton Knaggs , who in a tiny scene with only a few words is able to make his Cockney tinker character come alive . Ellen Drew & Marc Cramer handle the romance , which fortunately does not intrude too much on the story . The viewer , in the course of watching ISLE OF THE DEAD , will discover much about the medical state of catatonia , as well as the monstrous vorvolaka , part vampire - part werewolf , which haunts Greek nightmares . Lewton based his ideas for this film on a painting he had seen as a boy in Russia , Arnold Böcklin's darkly allegorical Island of the Dead ( 1880 ) , which is shown behind the opening credits of the film . This somewhat sinister painting was also the inspiration for Sergey Rachmaninoff's celebrated symphonic poem , ? The Isle of the Dead ' ( 1909 ) . Incidentally , the conflict which is the background to the film was the Balkan War of 1912 , in which the Balkan League ( Greece , Serbia , Bulgaria & Montenegro ) attacked the Ottoman Empire and destroyed most of its hegemony on the European continent . Begun in October and ended in December , it was short & bloody . However , troubles in Constantinople started hostilities up again in January of 1913 . It finally ended in May , with the Turks once more decisively defeated . Although the Empire was left very much weakened , the War solved very little else . In June , the victorious parties began fighting amongst themselves , with Greece & Serbia trouncing Bulgaria by August . Greece ended the two short Wars with Crete and parts of Macedonia & Epirus added to her territories and the new state of Albania was carved out of old Ottoman lands . But ancient animosities were aroused and the entire Peninsula lay waiting for the next international incident , which obligingly took place 10 months later at the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo .
Pluto Problems	A Walt Disney PLUTO Cartoon . PLUTO'S HOUSEWARMING of his splendid new home is hampered somewhat by a tiny turtle who is determined on moving in , too . Here is a rather routine Pluto cartoon , in which he gets to interact with yet another small , cuddly critter . That's Pluto's nemesis Butch who shows up in the second half of the film . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew figures on the sides of his vehicle . Back in Kansas City , along with artist Ub Iwerks , Walt developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated commercials and tiny cartoons for the local movie theaters . Always the innovator , his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series broke ground in placing a live figure in a cartoon universe . Business reversals sent Disney & Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923 , where Walt's older brother Roy became his lifelong business manager & counselor . When a mildly successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was snatched away by the distributor , the character of Mickey Mouse sprung into Walt's imagination , ensuring Disney's immortality . The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's screen debut , STEAMBOAT WILLIE ( 1928 ) , a tremendous audience success with its use of synchronized music . The SILLY SYMPHONIES soon appeared , and Walt's growing crew of marvelously talented animators were quickly conquering new territory with full color , illusions of depth and radical advancements in personality development , an arena in which Walt's genius was unbeatable . Mickey's feisty , naughty behavior had captured millions of fans , but he was soon to be joined by other animated companions : temperamental Donald Duck , intellectually-challenged Goofy and energetic Pluto . All this was in preparation for Walt's grandest dream - feature length animated films . Against a blizzard of doomsayers , Walt persevered and over the next decades delighted children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White , Pinocchio , Bambi , Peter Pan and Mr . Toad . Walt never forgot that his fortunes were all started by a mouse , or that simplicity of message and lots of hard work always pay off .
Mickey Flies The Skies	A Walt Disney MICKEY MOUSE Cartoon . Mickey , THE MAIL PILOT , knows his precious cargo must get through - even when menaced by Pete in his bat-like plane . This is a fine little black & white film , with lots of detail in the animation . Especially good opening shot of the busy airport - notice the hapless autogyro . Walt supplies Mickey's squeaky voice . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by drawings .

Two Wild - And Very Different - Rides	From English and American literature come two fabulous characters who will forever excite readers with THE ADVENTURES OF ICHABOD AND MR . TOAD . This was the last of Disney's compilation or anthology films - a form necessitated by the exigencies of the War years - and is actually a double featurette . Both halves would eventually be spun off into individual short subjects and work very well independently of each other . Their connections are quite tenuous : besides featuring ' fabulous characters ' each story showcases a celebrated wild ride - one of which would , indeed , provide a long-lasting ' dark show ' attraction at Disneyland . First up is THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS , which gives a drastically shortened & much revised view of Kenneth Grahame's classic book , focusing entirely on the chapters dealing with the exploits of the marvelous Mr . Toad and the troubles arising from his fixation with motorcars & speed ( although much more time is spent showing him in his canary-coloured gypsy cart ) . As such , it is a fine introduction to Toad Hall , but one can only wonder what Disney would have done with a feature length animated film that included the bucolic charm of the novel , the glories of the Riverbank & the terrors of the Wild Wood as well as the high jinks . The production values are excellent , with narration by the inimitable Basil Rathbone , and Eric Blore & J . Pat O'Malley obviously have a high time voicing the wanton Toad and his equine pal Cyril Proudbottom , but a true fan of Grahame's original creation can't help longing for a little more . . . Washington Irving's famous story , THE LEGEND OF SLEEPY HOLLOW , comes alive in the second half of the movie . Bing Crosby's singing narration and the top-notch animation tell a tale of humor and genuine fright . Ichabod Crane , the pedantic pedagogue , is a triumph of the animators ' art , while the film's climax - the ride through the Hollow & the appearance of the hideous Hessian - is a celebration of pacing and stylistic understatement . Based on material much shorter than Grahame's , the plot fits into the half hour time slot more easily and still has the luxury of introducing a wholly original & hilarious minor character in the chubby little Tilda , who completely steals the dancing sequence . It is the Horseman , however , who should remain the longest in the viewer's uneasy dreams - the embodiment of every Halloween nightmare .
Another Winning Film Starring George Arliss	Wise & benevolent , a king sporting the heart & soul of a common man is forced by revolution to abdicate . He returns to the wife & daughter he hasn't seen in 18 years , but soon discovers it is no easy task to reclaim the life of an ordinary man . Now a royalist plot may restore him to the throne , making the King's retirement merely THE KING'S VACATION . George Arliss , that most watchable & urbane of movie actors , is utterly charming in this short , sweet film . Delivering a drama lesson with every glance & gesture ( watch him in the scene in which he must meet the largest family in his kingdom ) , Arliss is - as always - a pure delight . It is a shame that he is all but forgotten today . Kudos should also go to Florence Arliss , for her sensitive portrayal of the Queen . A frequent costar of her husband's , Mrs . Arliss graced her scenes with a quiet dignity . Dick Powell also appears - but does not sing - in a small role as a mechanic in love with the King's daughter . Fine production values tremendously help the impact of this lovely film .
A Pup Tale With Butch	A Walt Disney PLUTO Cartoon . Pluto attempts to turn Butch's tasty snack into a T-BONE FOR TWO . This is another formula Pluto film - fun , but without much to distinguish it from many other Pup cartoons . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew figures on the sides of his vehicle .

Check The Pockets For Fine Entertainment	The movements of an accursed tail coat about the Big City , and the lives of those who use it , becomes part of the TALES OF MANHATTAN . Fox Studios and director Julien Duvivier fashioned this most enjoyable film . The idea of the tail coat never becomes silly or gets in the way of the plot , which doles out equal amounts of irony , suspense , pathos & comedy . The all-star cast gives worthy performances which keeps the viewer's attention right to the very end . SEQUENCE ONE An actor and his lover ( Charles Boyer & Rita Hayworth ) are confronted by her quietly sadistic husband ( Thomas Mitchell ) . Eugene Palette plays Boyer's loyal valet . An unbilled Robert Greig appears as the corpulent creator of the elegant tail coat . Most of the action in this sequence takes place at an estate outside of Manhattan . SEQUENCE TWO A shy fellow ( Henry Fonda ) tries to help his friend ( Cesar Romero ) out of a jam with his suspicious fiancé ( Ginger Rogers ) . Gail Patrick appears as Rogers ' nosy gal pal ; Roland Young plays Romero's protective valet . A quite different tail coat is the center of the plot here , which can become a bit confusing . SEQUENCE THREE A poor composer ( Charles Laughton ) finally has the opportunity to conduct his magnum opus at a concert . Radiant Elsa Lanchester appears as Laughton's adoring wife . Christian Rub plays a friendly cellist , while Victor Francen is very believable as the noble Bellini . An unbilled Dewey Robinson plays the bullying owner of a small café . Laughton is magnificent , as is to be expected , giving another master class in how to turn a small part into something very special . SEQUENCE FOURAfter being spiffed-up and accoutered in the tail coat , a skid row bum ( Edward G . Robinson ) makes a poignant appearance at the Waldorf-Astoria for his college's 25-year class reunion . James Gleason plays the kindly parson who runs a rescue mission ; silent screen star Mae Marsh appears as his sweet-natured wife . Harry Davenport appears as a wise old professor ; George Sanders snarls his way through his role as Robinson's old antagonist . Robinson & Gleason do some impressive acting , making their characters come alive . SEQUENCE FIVEAn eccentric professor ( W . C . Fields ) gives a temperance lecture to a gathering of high society swells , not knowing that the coconut milk has been liberally spiked . Phil Silvers shines in the brief role of the secondhand dealer who sells the tail coat to Fields . The monumental Margaret Dumont enlivens her scant appearance as the matron sponsoring Fields . Before the film's initial release , there was consternation from some of the other major stars concerning Fields ' large salary . The clamor grew to the point that Fox weaseled out by simply excising the sequence entirely . Rumor was allowed to grow that the removal was due to an inept performance from Fields . This is tragic , in that it was to be one of Fields ' final appearances on film and he is hilarious , as is Phil Silvers ( who has the distinction of being practically the only person in film history who ever managed to both outtalk & hoodwink Fields ) . After more than half a century , this sequence has finally been reunited with the rest of the film - - the only problem , for anyone that cares , being a slight one of continuity , as it is not shown how the tail coat returns to the Santelli Bros . shop in time for the burglary that opens Sequence Six . You have to be quick to read the painted sign on the Santelli Bros . window : WE TAKE AN ABSOLUTE LOSS ON EVERY TRANSACTION WE'RE ECCENTRICSEQUENCE SIXIn the film's most photographically stylish sequence , a shanty town full of impoverished farmers rejoice when the tail coat - - and its pocket full of cash - - literally falls out of the sky . J . Carrol Naish plays the airborne robber who loses the coat . Paul Robeson & Ethel Waters are the couple who find it . Eddie ' Rochester ' Anderson is their gently conniving preacher ; an almost unrecognizable Clarence Muse appears as a greedy old grandfather . Members of the wonderful Hall Johnson Choir lift their voices as the jubilant townsfolk . Once again , the action in this sequence mostly occurs far from Manhattan . The short song at the very end is the only occasion Robeson and The Hall Johnson Choir ever sang together on film - - and , unbelievably , Miss Waters isn't allowed to sing at all . Director Duvivier and stars Boyer , Robinson & Mitchell would travel to Universal Studios to make another sequential film , FLESH AND FANTASY , in 1943 .
William Haines & Marie Dressler Hilarious in Early Talkie Comedy	1930 . Silents were dead , talkies were king & it was William Haines golden Hollywood year . His pictures - he starred in 3 - made enough money at the box-office to make him the top male movie star of that year . THE GIRL SAID NO is one of those films . It is very much a typical Haines comedy , with lots of silliness based on his boyish character ( although he was 30 , he plays a college kid ) . His wealthy father dies , leaving his family penniless and Haines in need of finding money . The plot revolves around his attempts to make good in a new job , where he tries to impress Leila Hyams , the pretty secretary he meets there . Also in the cast are Francis X . Bushman , Jr . as Haines ' rival ; Clara Blandick ( Auntie Em in THE WIZARD OF OZ 9 years later ) ; and the ubiquitous Polly Moran . The inimitable & irrepressible Marie Dressler appears in only one scene , but it's a dandy . She plays a very rich potential client who mistakes Haines for her new doctor , which generates a hilarious slapstick sequence . With this one 10-minute segment , talkie comedy was off to a very good start .
Sinister Voyage	Holmes & Watson endure a PURSUIT TO ALGIERS whilst assisting a young king to evade assassins . Basil Rathbone & Nigel Bruce appeared as Sherlock Holmes & Dr . Watson on screen for the twelfth time in this enjoyable fast moving film . Not the best of the series by any means , it still offers the two wonderful actors adding nuances to the classic characters : Holmes seems a tad more human and enjoys a kiss from a pretty female , while Watson raises his voice to sing Loch Lomand . The plot , which has the intrepid duo escort a college boy monarch ( Leslie Vincent ) on a dangerous cruise from Britain to North Africa , is a bit silly , but it does serve to introduce some intriguing characters , including a frightened singer ( Marjorie Riordan ) , a strident fresh air fanatic ( Rosalind Ivan ) , a nervous little fellow with a big knife ( Martin Kosleck ) , and a strangely obliging steward ( Morton Lowry ) . This film followed THE WOMAN IN GREEN ( 1945 ) and preceded TERROR BY NIGHT ( 1946 ) .
Ghostly Encounters - - Act One	Cosmo TOPPER has his stuffy , henpecked life turned upside down by the interference of two recently deceased friends . The folks at Hal Roach Studios fashioned this popular supernatural comedy . Intended to be at the opposite extreme from the typical ghost thriller , there are no sudden chills or eerie ectoplasms here - - just lots of good humor and a few ( well done ) special effects . Owlish Roland Young plays the bemused recipient of his dead friends ' good deeds . No matter how drastically the intentions backfire , leading to arrest & scandal , Young remains a decent chap bent on regaining some equanimity in his life . ( What is most impressive about his performance are his hilarious physical contortions when under the invisible influence of the ghosts . ) Dear Billie Burke is wonderful , as usual , as Young's slightly bewildered wife , who has relinquished the role of lover to be mother hen to her husband - - hoping her control over him assures their acceptance by high society . As the Kerbys - - living and dead - - Constance Bennett & Cary Grant have plenty of star power & charm to spare and their spirits are certainly blithe , but a frank examination of their characters reveals some flaws . There is nothing funny about alcoholism or reckless driving , both of which contribute to their demise , and they are fortunate they kill only their own silly selves and not anyone else . That being said , they certainly do make a pair of great-looking spooks . The rest of the cast adds to the fun : Alan Mowbray once again plays a butler with an attitude ; young Arthur Lake appears as a hapless hotel employee ; elegant Hedda Hopper does well with her single scene as an unstuffy society doyenne ; J . Farrell MacDonald plays a no-nonsense cop ; and corpulent Eugene Pallette has fun with his role as a suspicious hotel detective . Composer Hoagy Carmichael appears as himself and Ward Bond plays a taxi driver , both uncredited . This was the first of a 3-film series and was followed by TOPPER TAKES A TRIP ( 1939 ) and TOPPER RETURNS ( 1941 ) .
A Real Howler	An MGM ALL BARKIE Short Subject . The romance that starts at Dogville's Bow-Wow-Inn between a HOT DOG and a lonely wife , ends in the courtroom with a case of murder . This very unusual little film is literally the sort that they just don't make anymore , with its rather solemn canines being dressed-up and jerked about with invisible wires . However , it is very funny , with its speakeasy sequence - full of dancing dogs , melodious musicians & gossipy patrons - a particular standout . Often overlooked or neglected today , the one and two-reel short subjects were useful to the Studios as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents , both in front & behind the camera . The dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film , something akin to writing a topnotch short story rather than a novel . Economical to produce in terms of both budget & schedule and capable of portraying a wide range of material , short subjects were the perfect complement to the Studios ' feature films .
A Film Ahead Of Its Time - For All Time	A black mother worries that her light skinned daughter will have only an IMITATION OF LIFE if she continually tries to pass for white . Let it be stated unequivocally that this is one of the most remarkable films of the 1930's - unique in that it deals squarely with aspects of the racial question decades before it became common to do so . After becoming accustomed to the casual racism of most Hollywood movies of the era , this honesty is quite astonishing . As the black mother , Louise Beavers is heartbreaking in the simple power of her performance . Joyously serving up love & pancakes , or devastated by her daughter's rejection of their race , Miss Beavers makes her audience feel her every emotion . This was the finest role of her film career , and she makes the most of it . However , the movie over , the studio system returned her to mammy parts . This is a tremendous blot on Hollywood's record . Beautiful Claudette Colbert is scintillating , as always . Playing a tenderhearted maple syrup saleslady who first employs Miss Beavers , and later befriends her , Miss Colbert adds a distinct touch of class to the film . But she is also sympathetic to the concerns of the story and helps to quietly push along the plea for racial equality . Elegant actor Warren William , he of the sophisticated profile , brings his considerable talents to the role of Miss Colbert's ichthyologist boyfriend . Refreshingly , he plays a solid , decent fellow - instead of the rake or cad which he portrayed so often & so well . His involvement is a definite asset to the film . The rest of the cast adds to the overall excellence of the production : acerbic Ned Sparks as Miss Colbert's business manager ; lovely Rochelle Hudson as her ready-for-love daughter ; Henry Armentta & Alan Hale as businessmen cajoled by Miss Colbert's charms ; and especially Fredi Washington , memorable as Miss Beavers ' daughter , a stranger inside her own skin . Movie mavens will spot Clarence Wilson as the pancake shop's landlord , Franklin Pangborn as a party guest & Paul Porcasi as a restaurant manager , all uncredited . IMITATION OF LIFE preached a powerful sermon on racial justice & equality , but the Hollywood congregation was not paying attention . It would be a very long time before black performers & black roles would be treated with the dignity they so desperately deserved .
Foolin ' The Doctor With The Little Rascals	An OUR GANG Comedy Short . Spanky , Buckwheat & Alfalfa are THREE SMART BOYS . If they can get a doctor to agree they've caught an epidemic , the school will have to be closed . So , with bloated bellies & speckled faces they head for the nearest medical man - who happens to be a veterinarian with a wacky sense of humor . . . A funny little film - short & to the point . Highlight : Buckwheat & the monkey . That's Rosina Lawrence as the teacher .
A Christmas Caper With Chipmunks	A Walt Disney MICKEY MOUSE Cartoon . PLUTO'S CHRISTMAS TREE arrives in Mickey's living room with Chip ' n ' Dale still living in it . . . This enjoyable little Holiday film matches the frustrated Pup against the cunning Chipmunks , with all the props & paraphernalia of Christmas Eve adding extra interest . Mickey has only a supporting role ; Goofy , Donald & Minnie have a quick cameo at the end of the cartoon as carolers singing ' Deck The Halls . ' Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by pictures & drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew comic figures on the sides of his vehicle . Back in Kansas City , along with artist Ub Iwerks , Walt developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated commercials and tiny cartoons for the local movie theaters . Always the innovator , his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series broke ground in placing a live figure in a cartoon universe . Business reversals sent Disney & Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923 , where Walt's older brother Roy became his lifelong business manager & counselor . When a mildly successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was snatched away by the distributor , the character of Mickey Mouse sprung into Walt's imagination , ensuring Disney's immortality . The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's screen debut , STEAMBOAT WILLIE ( 1928 ) , a tremendous audience success with its use of synchronized music . The SILLY SYMPHONIES soon appeared , and Walt's growing crew of marvelously talented animators were quickly conquering new territory with full color , illusions of depth and radical advancements in personality development , an arena in which Walt's genius was unbeatable . Mickey's feisty , naughty behavior had captured millions of fans , but he was soon to be joined by other animated companions : temperamental Donald Duck , intellectually-challenged Goofy and energetic Pluto . All this was in preparation for Walt's grandest dream - feature length animated films . Against a blizzard of doomsayers , Walt persevered and over the next decades delighted children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White , Pinocchio , Dumbo , Bambi & Peter Pan . Walt never forgot that his fortunes were all started by a mouse , or that childlike simplicity of message and lots of hard work will always pay off .
Beery & Rooney Propel Shipboard Drama	In 1860 , a mutinous crew forces the captain of a former SLAVE SHIP to return to Africa for another highly profitable human cargo . Sadly neglected , this is a film with some very good elements indeed . Stirring action , a little romance , a dose of humor and a social conscious are among its strengths . Although the opening shipyard scenes have a rather lean feel to their production values - with the sparse crowd of extras and the rear projection - once the plot moves to shipboard & Africa the film's quality kicks into high gear . The climax , with its gunplay & explosions , is especially exciting . The tying of the slaves to the anchor chain - a horrendous scene - anticipates AMISTAD by about 60 years . The acting is quite good . Warner Baxter nicely underplays his role as the slaver captain who reforms upon marrying lovely Elizabeth Allan . Rumpled Wallace Beery as the First Mate & spunky Mickey Rooney as a disillusioned cabin boy are a great acting team and tremendous fun to watch . Beery was an actor who could steal a scene from anyone ( except the late Marie Dressler ) , but he almost meets his match in Rooney . The Kid shows the vivacity & talent which would soon catapult him to Hollywood's top box office star . Joseph Schildkraut scores in a flamboyant role as a foreign slave trader . Jane Darwell is funny in her few moments as Miss Allan's tough old mother . George Sanders plays a sophisticated mutineer & Edwin Maxwell is a nervous auctioneer . The massive Jane Jones is striking - literally - as a Virginia saloonkeeper who refuses to take nonsense from anyone . In unbilled roles , movie mavens should recognize Lon Chaney , Jr . as a most unfortunate dock worker , and young Matthew ' Stymie ' Beard , of OUR GANG fame , as a boy on the wharf . It is ironic , even with the film's sentiment for decent behavior towards Blacks , that 1930's Hollywood was still utterly racist and did not promote equal treatment for African-American performers ( Asian actors fared little better ) . The Studios were still very segregated , Black & White stars rarely socialized on an equal footing , and racial stereotypes abounded in the movie plots . Only occasionally did Black performers ' names appear in the credits and then usually at the bottom of the list . SLAVE SHIP preaches a good sermon , but the Hollywood congregation still needed to wake up & deal with its own intolerant behavior .
On The Prowl With Pluto	A Walt Disney PLUTO Cartoon . Primo , Pluto's ' primitive instinct , ' comes alive and instructs the clumsy Pup in the ways of tracking food - including a ferocious bear . . . PRIMITIVE PLUTO is a humorous , but routine , Pup film . Voice Master Paul Frees does the honors for Primo . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew figures on the sides of his vehicle .

A Pup Tale With Coyotes	A Walt Disney PLUTO Cartoon . A couple of PESTS OF THE WEST - father & son coyote - attempt to raid the hen-house guarded by the ever vigilant Pluto . The plot has been reworked many times , but the results are enjoyable . This was one of a handful of little films to feature Bent-Tail the coyote and his dimwitted offspring , Bent-Tail , Junior , as The Pup's antagonists . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew figures on the sides of his vehicle .

Early Griffith Holiday Film	A Biograph film . On Christmas Eve , two children set A TRAP FOR SANTA , with somewhat surprising results . . . Film legend D . W . Griffith directed this little film . If it is rather heavy-handed with the pathos - drunken father , desperate mother , hungry children - it is simply an indication that Griffith was learning to master his trade as he went along . Within a few more years he would be at the top of his profession - as would cameraman Billy Bitzer , who photographed this film . Movie mavens should probably recognize Henry B . Walthall as Arthur , the father & Mack Sennett as an unfriendly bartender , both uncredited . Al Kryszak provided the score for the video compilation A Christmas Past , in which this film appears .
Satisfying Little Film	An MGM Short Subject . General George Washington asks Betsy Ross in 1776 to design & create THE FLAG to be used by the American forces . MGM does a most commendable job with this little silent film , combining patriotism & romance . Matinee idol Francis X . Bushman has a properly noble bearing as Washington ( his career was about to go on the skids for inadvertently angering Louis B . Mayer ) . Enid Bennett shows enthusiasm in her role as Miss Ross . A subplot concerns Washington's judicious dealing with a young British couple ( Alice Calhoun & Johnnie Walker ) harboring in the Ross home . Notice the sensitive way in which the film handles the pregnancy of Miss Calhoun's character . The early Technicolor is very appealing to the eye , especially in the scene where Miss Ross points to the twilight heavens to explain her inspiration for the new flag . The film has been restored and given a splendid new score by Vivek Maddala . Often overlooked or neglected today , the one and two-reel short subjects were useful to the Studios as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents , both in front & behind the camera . The dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film , something akin to writing a topnotch short story rather than a novel . Economical to produce in terms of both budget & schedule and capable of portraying a wide range of material , short subjects were the perfect complement to the Studios ' feature films .
Mickey's Lilliputian Adventure	A Walt Disney MICKEY MOUSE Cartoon . GULLIVER MICKEY enthralls his young nephews with the story of his adventures among the tiny people of a faraway land . With a nod of acknowledgement to Jonathan Swift , this is a well-made little black & white film featuring very fine animation of the miniature world Mickey discovers . Sleepy Pluto makes a tiny cameo appearance . Walt Disney gave the Mouse his squeaky voice . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by pictures & drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew comic figures on the sides of his vehicle . Back in Kansas City , along with artist Ub Iwerks , Walt developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated commercials and tiny cartoons for the local movie theaters . Always the innovator , his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series broke ground in placing a live figure in a cartoon universe . Business reversals sent Disney & Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923 , where Walt's older brother Roy became his lifelong business manager & counselor . When a mildly successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was snatched away by the distributor , the character of Mickey Mouse sprung into Walt's imagination , ensuring Disney's immortality . The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's screen debut , STEAMBOAT WILLIE ( 1928 ) , a tremendous audience success with its use of synchronized music . The SILLY SYMPHONIES soon appeared , and Walt's growing crew of marvelously talented animators were quickly conquering new territory with full color , illusions of depth and radical advancements in personality development , an arena in which Walt's genius was unbeatable . Mickey's feisty , naughty behavior had captured millions of fans , but he was soon to be joined by other animated companions : temperamental Donald Duck , intellectually-challenged Goofy and energetic Pluto . All this was in preparation for Walt's grandest dream - feature length animated films . Against a blizzard of doomsayers , Walt persevered and over the next decades delighted children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White , Pinocchio , Dumbo , Bambi & Peter Pan . Walt never forgot that his fortunes were all started by a mouse , or that childlike simplicity of message and lots of hard work always pay off .
Things That Go Bump In The Night	A Walt Disney Short Subject . Through the millennia mankind has always been interested in - and afraid of - the unknown . His imagination has allowed him to invent colorful explanations for natural phenomena , but still some intriguing questions linger . MAN , MONSTERS AND MYSTERIES is an entertaining little film which briefly looks at the history of man's belief in fantastic creatures and then spends the bulk of the remaining time exploring one of the greatest mysteries of all - the Loch Ness Monster in Scotland . A good deal of information is given , both legendary & factual , eyewitnesses are heard from , scientific evidence is reviewed and the viewers are allowed to form their own conclusions . The film is helped tremendously by the talents of Sebastian Cabot as the friendly narrator and Sterling Holloway as the voice of the animated Nessie .
Charlie Ruggles Shines In Comedic Caper	Romantic complications abound when a zany young nobleman at Oxford is persuaded to impersonate his friend CHARLEY'S AUNT from Brazil - - where the nuts come from . . . Although quite an antique - with its faded print & missing moments - this ancient talkie version of the Brandon Thomas chestnut looks like what it is : a filmed version of the play , full of slapstick & mistaken identities . However , it is remarkable for containing one of the first great comedy performances of the sound cinema - Charlie Ruggles in the title role . Although at 44 he's too old to be playing a college boy , and his American accent initially seems a bit out of place , Ruggles soon dominates the proceedings with his shameless acting . Flouncing about in a granny dress , shawl & curls , flirting outrageously with two silly old men , taking pratfalls , mugging the camera , he is absolutely hilarious . Off to a good start , for the next 40 years Ruggles would be considered one of Hollywood's ablest character actors . Supporting him are some fine British stalwarts - Halliwell Hobbes , Doris Lloyd , Hugh Williams . Together with Charlie Ruggles , they make this seldom-seen film an entertaining treat for modern viewers .
A Last Look At Ross Alexander	Mistaken for a famous British singing star , an American college girl decides she's READY , WILLING AND ABLE to conquer Broadway - especially after meeting the young scriptwriter who's producing the play . . . A fine example of the musical comedies which Warner Brothers seemed to produce so effortlessly during the 1930's , it's a shame this film has become so obscure . With good production values & a snappy storyline , it's still a pleasant entertainment . The major missing component is Busby Berkeley ; the final production number , with Ruby Keeler & dancer Lee Dixon hoofing it upon the keys of a giant typewriter , fairly cries for the Master to send it over the top . Pert & pretty , Miss Keeler is , as always , much fun to watch . Many of her scenes are given the added attractions of the lovely Carol Hughes , playing her best friend . Wini Shaw , as a singer with too much past & tart-tongued secretary Jane Wyman also contribute to the fun . The comedy relief is largely handled by Allen Jenkins as a loudmouthed agent , Louise Fazenda as a faded Shakespearean actress & Hugh O'Connell as a society fuddy-duddy . Comic cameos by E . E . Clive & Lillian Kemble-Cooper as an English knight & lady , and Barnett Parker as a helpful British butler , are also welcome . Movie mavens will spot an unbilled Carlyle Moore Jr . as a dockside reporter . Ultimately , though , there is sadness attached to this film . The leading man , Ross Alexander , shot himself before the film could be released . This was his final film ; he was only 29 . Born Ross Smith in Brooklyn in 1907 , Alexander had the personality , talent & good looks which should have spelled significant stardom . But Hollywood is notoriously unpredictable , and Alexander , unhappy with the way his career was going & obviously still troubled by the gunshot suicide of his first wife in December of 1935 , placed a pistol to his own head on January 2 , 1937 . Once dead , it was Warner Brothers that paid him the final indignity . Having a completed film with a star who was not only deceased , but a suicide as well , was a bit more than the Studio wanted to deal with . So , cutting their losses , they gave Ross Alexander fifth place billing on the lineup of performers for READY , WILLING AND ABLE , where he should have received first or second . Outside of his appearance in A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM ( 1935 ) , he is almost forgotten now . Ross Alexander was a victim of the Hollywood system and his own private anguish , each of which fed on the other . He should be remembered as a fine young actor , who , in a very few years , brought lots of enjoyment to movie audiences . This is typified by his best scene in READY , WILLING AND ABLE , where he introduces the Johnny Mercer lyrics for ' Too Marvelous For Words , ' by gently reciting them to Ruby Keeler . It is a tremendously poignant few moments .
Celebrating Arbor Day With The Little Rascals	An OUR GANG Comedy Short . It's ARBOR DAY and Spanky's school is putting on a pageant - which he is determined to have nothing to do with . Eventually he agrees , but the real surprise of the proceedings is the short performance put on by a couple of midgets disguised as children . Not much plot in this one , but it's enjoyable . That's George & Olive Brasno as the little people . Film mavens will spot Hattie McDaniel as Buckwheat's mother . Alfalfa warbles ' Trees ' , badly .
Colman & Fairbanks Jr . Shine in Classic Adventure Film	Traveling in a Middle European kingdom , an Englishman on a fishing vacation discovers to his astonishment that he is an identical look-alike for the country's king . When the dissipated monarch is unable to attend his own coronation , the Englishman is pressured to impersonate him temporarily . But when he falls in love with the new queen and the real king is kidnapped by an evil half-brother , the Englishman is swept into a world of intrigue & danger he scarcely knew existed . Can he rescue THE PRISONER OF ZENDA without losing his own life ? This is one of the great adventure films of the 1930's . Given lavish treatment by Selznick Studios , it is escapist cinema at its most enjoyable . Silky-voiced Ronald Colman is perfectly cast as both the Englishman & the King . He was one of those rare , fortunate actors with great screen charisma - his every moment , every word , is interesting to the viewer . He almost meets his match , though , in Douglas Fairbanks Jr . , here playing a charming & completely ruthless young villain . Their rapier fight stands out in a decade full of terrific swordplay . The rest of the cast is equally impressive : lovely Madeleine Carroll , wicked Raymond Massey , frantic Mary Astor , stalwart David Niven and especially wonderful old Sir C . Aubrey Smith , a model of elderly devotion & courage .
Forgotten Crime Classic	The leader of a chain gang work force struggling to build the Liberty Road ( HELL'S HIGHWAY ) finds his escape plans thwarted when his younger brother becomes a prisoner , too . Hard hitting & gritty , this neglected little drama is fascinating in its detailed portrayal of a tough subject . Road gang prisoners were still being systematically abused in 1932 and this film helped to shine a light into some very dirty corners , while at the same time delivering a compelling human interest story . Richard Dix gives a typically fine performance as Duke Ellis , a bad guy with a good heart . He's able to dominate the other prisoners until his kid brother ( very well played by Tom Brown ) reveals his soft spot . Dix was a strong , virile actor who survived the transition from Silents to Talkies in good form and easily projected a persona of raw intensity . It is a shame that he is nearly forgotten today . Although she receives third place billing , lovely Rochelle Hudson , as young Brown's girlfriend , has very little to do in her only scene . Of much more interest is elderly Louise Carter , as the distraught mother of Dix & Brown . In her few moments of screen time she delivers a terrific performance of a good woman barely holding on to her emotional balance . Her participation in the film alone would make it worth watching . A handful of character actors also add to the movie's distinction : beefy Stanley Fields as a sympathetic prison officer ; Charles Middleton as a mystic , other-worldly prisoner ; C . Henry Gordon as the sadistic violin playing warden ; Sandy Roth as a violent , nearly blind , prisoner ; and Warner Richmond as a guard who fears he may also be a cuckold . Clarence Muse & Fuzzy Knight have small roles as prisoners . Movie mavens will spot an uncredited Louise Beavers as Muse's visiting sweetheart . An intriguing aspect of the film is how the black prisoners are used as a kind of Greek Chorus , their songs making ironic comment upon the action . Their ' Frankie and Johnny ' parody sequence in particular is a quietly brilliant moment of film-making in how it encapsulates , in a very short time , a key plot twist .
Mr . Wheeler & Mr . Woolsey Enliven Movie Musical Of Yesteryear	New Orleans songbird DIXIANA attracts both the noble son of a Dutch planter and the murderous owner of a music hall casino . Here is an interesting antique from 1930 , the first year Hollywood was all-Talkie . William Haines comedies were the box-office winners & musicals - like this one - were also extremely popular . Given a lavish production , especially during the Technicolor finale , a close examination of the film revels that the mysteries of the microphone were quickly being deciphered . Bebe Daniels & Everett Marshall provide the romance & music . They certainly try their best , although the dialogue is not overly kind to them , and her fake Southern accent coupled with his wooden acting skills are two high hurdles for them to jump . The film is punctuated by burlesque interludes provided by one of the finest comedic teams of the 1930's - Wheeler & Woolsey . Bert Wheeler ( the short , curly-headed one ) and Robert Woolsey ( the skinny fellow with glasses ) were always great fun and their jokes still hit home today , even if they themselves are virtually forgotten . Here they are given great assistance by dialect comedian Joseph Cawthorn , playing their Dutch host at a sumptuous Louisiana plantation ; he fits in so well , especially when pulling the Three Cigar Joke , that he practically becomes a third member of the team . Also on hand , as she was in so many of the Boys ' films , is pert Dorothy Lee , as kewpie doll cute as ever . The massive Jobyna Howland , playing Cawthorn's temperamental wife , proves once again that she could handle the slapstick as well as the histrionics . Both ladies supply the extra oomph lacking in Miss Daniels ' performance . Ralf Harolde makes a mean villain and unbilled George Herman appears as the impressively limber contortionist . It should be noted that there are some racist elements in the story ; this was not unusual in American movies of that era . The early Technicolor sequence - featuring the Mardi Gras in full swing - is very pleasing to the eye , benefiting from a recent film restoration . However , scenes still seem to be missing , evidenced by Wheeler suddenly appearing in drag ( or is that his Carnival costume ? ) without explanation . Best of all , the legendary Bill Robinson finally arrives , for a total of 3 minutes , to dance for our delight .
Classic Mary Pickford Heart Warmer	An irrepressible orphan girl , living in the appalling conditions of a large asylum , is rescued by a mysterious benefactor and sent to college . Affectionately referring to him as DADDY-LONG-LEGS , she strives to make him proud of her . But when unexpected love comes her way , will she follow her heart or the wishes of her patron ? Mary Pickford was the greatest movie star of the 20th Century . No one else even came close to inspiring the love & devotion of the millions of fans who flocked to see her silent films . In our jaded age it is difficult to understand why a diminutive little lady could engender such ardor right around the world . For answers , one need look no further than DADDY-LONG-LEGS . Expertly blending joy & pathos , Mary makes us instantly feel the emotions her character is living through . Whether it's stealing a doll for a dying child , dunking a bully in a well , listening to her dead mother being insulted in the worst way , or feeling the pangs & delights of a first love , Pickford tugs at our heart strings , our tear ducts , our funny bones . To watch this film is to get a glimpse as to why America's Sweetheart stands absolutely unique in her legendary status . Although this is Mary's show all the way , in the supporting cast Milla Davenport should be noted for her vivid portrayal of the vile asylum warden . The film's director , Marshall A . Neilan , appears as a hapless young Lothario . It was the success of this film at the box office which inspired Pickford to form a studio & become her own distributor . So it was that United Artists was born , with partners Douglas Fairbanks , Charlie Chaplin & D . W . Griffith . The film has been beautifully restored , with a fine musical score . Notice the original ' art titles , ' the evocative paintings which enrich the captions .
Hiding From The Law With Mr . Laurel & Mr . Hardy	A LAUREL & HARDY Comedy Short . On the run from the police , Stan & Ollie hide in a deserted mansion . But when an English nobleman appears , wanting to rent the place & meet the owner and servants , the Boys find themselves in ANOTHER FINE MESS . A funny early talkie . Highlight : Stan's hilarious impersonation of Agnes the Maid . That's James Finlayson as Colonel Buckshot , Charles K . Gerard & Thelma Todd as Lord and Lady Plumtree .
A Little Film Of Great Significance	Roused from somnambulistic lethargy to defend herself against unspeakable evil , a mighty nation would make foreign tyrants fear the sound of MAIN STREET ON THE MARCH ! Here is a tremendous example of the power of film when expertly crafted . It is also an invaluable video document of the situation in America at one of the supremely pivotal moments of her history . Blending documentary footage with Studio shots , the film quickly paints a snapshot portrait of the country and its moods in the months leading up to active participation in World War Two . Conceived by MGM as a stern warning against American neutrality in response to the threats of Axis aggression , the film was virtually ready for release when the Japanese Empire made its sneak attack against Hawaii on December 7 , 1941 . Producer John Nesbitt hastily rewrote & recorded the new narration , without altering the existing music or sound effects . The emotionally stirring result was considered so forceful that MAIN STREET ON THE MARCH ! was awarded the Academy Award for best two-reel short subject of 1941 . A sequel , MAIN STREET TODAY , was produced in 1944 . After Pearl Harbor , Hollywood went to war totally against the Axis . Not only did many of the stars join up or do home front service , but the output of the Studios was largely turned to the war effort . The newsreels , of course , brought the latest war news into the neighborhood theater every week . The features showcased battle stories or war related themes . Even the short subjects & cartoons were used as a quick means of spreading Allied propaganda , the boosting of morale or information dissemination . Together , Uncle Sam , the American People & Hollywood proved to be an unbeatable combination .
Topnotch Acting Enlivens Lumber Tale	An aging lumber tycoon tries to relive his youth after meeting the hauntingly beautiful daughter of an old friend . Based on the sprawling novel by Edna Ferber , COME AND GET IT is a fascinating love story , filled with action & tenderness and some very good acting . The production values are on a high order , with the authentic logging sequence especially exciting . Boisterous , brash & bold , Edward Arnold portrays the brawling two-fisted lumberjack who pushes himself to the top of the heap , trampling on his one great love in the process . Although completely unbelievable as a young man during the first three-quarters of an hour , this is not a problem as he is never anything less than enjoyable in the role . Miss Frances Farmer , playing a tenderhearted floozy and her own ambitious daughter , has the best film of her career . She is nothing less than radiant and her obvious talent makes her bizarre personal history all that much more tragic . Wonderful Walter Brennan plays Arnold's jovial Swedish pal , in a performance that would catapult him out of cinematic anonymity and earn him the first of his three Oscars for Best Supporting Actor . Seemingly able to play any kind of part - as long as the character was middle-aged or elderly - during his 46 years in movies & television Mr . Brennan would become one of America's most beloved character actors . He died in 1974 at the age of 80 . Almost obscured by the oversized talents around him , Joel McCrea wisely turns in an understated performance as Arnold's quiet , intelligent son ( he invents the disposable paper cup ! ) . His years of solid successes in front of the cameras were adding up and he would soon become a major Hollywood star . A quartet of fine actresses fill smaller roles : Mary Nash as Arnold's neglected wife ; Andrea Leeds as his adored daughter ; Mady Christians as Brennan's sturdy , sensible niece ; and Cecil Cunningham as Arnold's intuitive , sharp-tongued secretary . That's porcine Edwin Maxwell once again playing a bad guy , this time the crooked owner of a lumber camp saloon . The song which is used as the theme for Miss Farmer's characters is ? Aura Lee , ' ( written in 1861 by W . W . Fosdick & George R . Poulton ) a very popular strain on both sides during the War Between The States . Decades later , in the 1950's , Elvis Presley would use the tune for one of his biggest hits , ? Love Me Tender . '
Rousing Adventure Epic	A young English army officer resigns his commission just as war in Africa breaks out . His 3 best friends , officers all , and his fiancée each give him a white feather - the sign of the coward . Shunned & ostracized , he undertakes a mission to clear his honour & prove his courage . This is a wonderful British adventure film , equally on a par with anything Hollywood was to produce in that golden year of 1939 . Shot in color , with spare-no-expense filming in the Sudan , THE FOUR FEATHERS is a paean to the glory days of Victoria's Empire & the men who fought to build it . Sir John Clements is excellent as the young hero . Although virtually unknown to American audiences his entire career , Sir John was a very fine actor with a warmly distinctive voice which he uses here to advantage . Sir Ralph Richardson appears , terrific as always , as one of the friends ; so does John Laurie , very good as the troublesome Khalifa . Sir C . Aubrey Smith , magnificent as a curmudgeonly old general , provides the final hurdle Sir John must jump to regain his reputation .
Fast & Funny	A Vitaphone Short Subject . Tabloid snoop sister HOT NEWS MARGIE will go to any length to ensure she gets star football player Babe Booth's admission to a secret marriage . This exceedingly brief & lively little film wastes no time going for the laughs . Marjorie Beebe gives a very boisterous performance in the title role . Often overlooked or neglected today , the one and two-reel short subjects were useful to the Studios as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents , both in front & behind the camera . The dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film , something like writing a topnotch short story rather than a novel . Economical to produce in terms of both budget & schedule and capable of portraying a wide range of material , short subjects were the perfect complement to the Studios ' feature films .
Their Final Bow	A Walt Disney HUMPHREY THE BEAR Cartoon . The Little Ranger comes up with a sneaky plan to trick Humphrey & the Brownstone Bears into putting all the tourist litter IN THE BAG . This funny little film was the final theatrical appearance by both Humphrey the Bear & Ranger J . Audubon Woodlore ; although their cartoons had provided lots of laughs during the 1950's Disney now retired them permanently to Brownstone Park . The cartoon's title tune is a fine piece of swing music and is a good example of the care Disney took with providing just the right music for his projects . Watch for a cameo appearance by a Very Important Bear with a Very Important Message . Bill Thompson provides the Little Ranger with his puffy voice . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by pictures & drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew comic figures on the sides of his vehicle . Back in Kansas City , along with artist Ub Iwerks , Walt developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated commercials and tiny cartoons for the local movie theaters . Always the innovator , his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series broke ground in placing a live figure in a cartoon universe . Business reversals sent Disney & Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923 , where Walt's older brother Roy became his lifelong business manager & counselor . When a mildly successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was snatched away by the distributor , the character of Mickey Mouse sprung into Walt's imagination , ensuring Disney's immortality . The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's screen debut , STEAMBOAT WILLIE ( 1928 ) , a tremendous audience success with its use of synchronized music . The SILLY SYMPHONIES soon appeared , and Walt's growing crew of marvelously talented animators were quickly conquering new territory with full color , illusions of depth and radical advancements in personality development , an arena in which Walt's genius was unbeatable . Mickey's feisty , naughty behavior had captured millions of fans , but he was soon to be joined by other animated companions : temperamental Donald Duck , intellectually-challenged Goofy and energetic Pluto . All this was in preparation for Walt's grandest dream - feature length animated films . Against a storm of naysayers , Walt persevered and over the next decades delighted children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White , Pinocchio , Dumbo , Bambi & Peter Pan . Walt never forgot that his fortunes were all started by a mouse , or that childlike simplicity of message and lots of hard work always pay off .
Al Jolson Stars In Unusual Film	If faithful Gus can only help the racehorse BIG BOY to win the Kentucky Derby the white folks who employ him will be saved from financial ruin . Strange , offbeat , bizarre , unique . All of these terms can describe this film which features legendary entertainer Al Jolson in blackface , playing a black man . While acted with tongue very firmly planted in cheek , and meant solely for lighthearted entertainment , this movie will definitely not be to every viewer's taste . Not until the final minutes does Jolson appear as himself , joking with the audience and reprising the film's dullest song yet once again . The movie obviously has its roots in the minstrel tradition in which a group of musical white men would perform , made-up as blacks . Also , Jolson's own career involved extensive use of blackface routines and he had become quite celebrated for them . For their time , these were all considered quite normal and not offensive ( to white audiences ) . It should also be noted that racial meandering was engaged in routinely in films for decades , with several top white stars ( Helen Hayes , Paul Muni , Kate Hepburn , Ramon Novarro , Edward G . Robinson ) playing Asian roles , although these were usually done for a serious , and not a comedic , purpose . Once past the initial oddity , it must be said that Jolson is certainly fun to watch and is obviously having a great time . Singing constantly ( none of his big hits , but he does well with a couple of old Spirituals ) , wisecracking and ad-libbing shamelessly , he is impossible to ignore . In his heyday , he was one of the most popular performers in the world and it's easy to see why . Although Jolson dominates the film , there are a couple of other performers worth noting . Wonderful old character actress Louise Closser Hale , always a joy to watch , plays the plantation matriarch . In a lengthy & superfluous flashback scene , beefy Noah Beery appears as a bullying braggadocio who harasses Jolson . It probably goes without saying that there is a fair amount of racism woven into the plot .
Performin ' On The Radio With The Little Rascals	An OUR GANG Comedy Short . Billing themselves as The International Silver Screen Submarine Band , the Gang enters a prestigious radio talent hunt for youngsters . Arriving late at the studio , Stymie , Spanky & the Rascals create havoc - giving those around them a good case of MIKE FRIGHT . A fun little film , with interesting performances by kids not part of the Gang . Highlight : the Rascals perform ' The Man On The Flying Trapeze ' .
An Utter Delight From Mr . Lloyd	Uptown millionaire J . Harold Manners leads a life insulated by his immense wealth until he meets a very pretty young lady working with her father in a Downtown skid row mission . Comic genius Harold Lloyd had another tremendous success with FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE , a silent film very simple of plot but wildly delirious in terms of hilarious detail & inspiration . Harold had the enviable knack of making an audience like him immediately and empathize with his tribulations . They entered into and became a part of his gags , watching them build and grow , until the final explosion of laughter and the immediate start of his next comedic onslaught . Here , Harold has two of his finest sequences , two very different extended chases which illustrate his visual wizardry and perfect timing . In the first , Harold infuriates a growing crowd of enraged hoodlums , crooks and ne'er-do-wells into chasing him into the mission , so as to please the sweet young lady . In the second , which climaxes the movie , Harold races to his own delayed wedding , through crowded New York streets ( actually filmed in Los Angeles ) , while shepherding five very friendly and extremely intoxicated bums , culminating in a wild ride atop a runaway double-decker bus . Through it all , Harold exhibits his magnificent athletic ability , putting himself in real danger , a self-imposed peril made even more remarkable by the fact that he was missing half of his right hand . The production values in the film are absolutely first rate , even down to casting the ? faces , ' wistful & careworn , seen in the mission scenes . The logistics involved in filming the action sequences on actual city streets , involving crowds of extras and split-second precision timing for the stunts , is beyond merely impressive . Lloyd , who fathered the idea , put the film through five previews until he was sure he had it perfect . Jobyna Ralston once again amply fills the role of the girl of Harold's dreams . Diminutive Paul Weigel exudes saintly goodness as her father . Noah Young brings bullish bluster to his role of a tough gangster tamed by Mr . Lloyd . Robert Israel has composed an excellent film score which perfectly complements Harold's antics on the screen .
Douglas Fairbanks Swashes His Buckle In Grand Fashion	A nobleman vows vengeance on the cutthroats responsible for his father's death . Becoming THE BLACK PIRATE , he joins their scurvy crew and quickly becomes their leader . But his plans for revenge become more complicated when he meets his first captive - a beautiful Spanish princess . Roistering , robust & richly detailed , this was one of Douglas Fairbanks ' greatest films . With enough excitement to satisfy any lover of adventure , one needs only read the film's prologue to get an idea of its delights : ' A page from the History and Lives of the most Bloodthirsty PIRATES who ever infested THE SOUTHERN SEAS . Being an account of BUCCANEERS & the Spanish MAIN , the Jolly Roger , Golden Galleons , bleached skulls , BURIED TREASURE , the Plank , dirks & cutlasses , SCUTTLED SHIPS , marooning , DESPERATE DEEDS , DESPERATE MEN , and - even on this dark soil - ROMANCE . ' Aside from the bleached skulls , everything else is there as promisedFairbanks is a joy to behold , exulting in his physical prowess , becoming a legend of the screen before the delighted eyes of the viewer . Can any other swashbuckler top the flair or élan of the sequence where Doug captures a merchantman single-handed , climbing up the forecastle & sliding down the slit sails on his dagger , light as any sprite ? No one else would have even dared . As the princess , Billie Dove is beautiful , but has very little to do except look frightened . Donald Crisp , in a change of pace role , is very enjoyable as a gruff one-armed Scots pirate who befriends Fairbanks . Anders Randolf & Sam De Grasse are the black-hearted pirate captain & lieutenant whom Doug must contend with and they are nasty indeed . A milestone in cinematic history , this was one of the first movies to be filmed entirely in Technicolor . In its restored version , it is very pleasant to the eyes , its antique hues perfectly complementing the richly textured art design , costumes & sets . For those interested in such things , there are explanations for the various special effects ( the underwater attack , for instance ) , but the reader will need to look elsewhere for them . Sometimes too many facts can spoil the illusion of daydreams so necessary for the enjoyment of silent cinema . Find this fabulous film & dream on . Too bad about the bleached skulls , though . . .
Long , Long Ago	A banker in old Nebraska strives to turn his town into a bastion of civilization & civility . Like THE CONQUERORS of the West before and after him he lets nothing stand in his way . Here is a prime example of a very fine film which is virtually forgotten today . Unfairly compared to CIMARRON ( 1931 ) - with which it shares some of the same themes and performers - THE CONQUERORS is well able to stand on its own merits , among which first-rate production values and very fine acting are not the least . Certain sequences - the keelboat , the hanging of the outlaws , the opening of the new bank , the arrival of the first train - remain in the memory for a long time . Covering the years 1873 to 1929 , we watch the growth of Fort Allen , Nebraska , as seen through the life of banker Roger Standish , most effectively played by Richard Dix . This underrated actor creates a hero worth emulating , one who courageously strives to improve his society and protect his investors through the quiet dignity of his own character . As his wife , he is well-matched by actress Ann Harding , who provides a tower of strength and graciousness through every adversity . Much of the story's laughter - and heartache - is provided through the wonderful pairing of Edna May Oliver , as the no-nonsense owner of the local hotel , and Guy Kibbee , as her alcoholic doctor husband . These two inimitable character actors effortlessly steal all of their scenes - as they would continue to do time & time again throughout the rest of the decade . Movie mavens will recognize Elizabeth Patterson as Dix ' sympathetic landlady and Robert Greig as the blasé Englishman at Miss Harding's auction sale , both uncredited . David O . Selznick was the Executive Producer ; the rousing music was composed by Max Steiner . Slavko Vorkapich , the Master of the Montage , provided the transitional effects .
A Little Inadequacy Goes A Long Way	A Walt Disney Cartoon . Life is tough for MORRIS THE MIDGET MOOSE because of his stunted stature . This little film , while humorous , is a far cry from the great Disney classics of the past - the animation is routine and the plot is rather lackluster . Morris ' story is told by the Bootle Beetle , in the last of his four appearances in a Disney cartoon . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by pictures & drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew comic figures on the sides of his vehicle .
