Even Sarah Jessica Parker's charm couldn't save this stillborn romantic comedy	This is one of the better examples of how Hollywood have lost their edge , and how easy it is to make a romantic comedy . The plot is uninspired , the acting is unimpressive , the characters are poorly written and uninteresting , and the pacing is just awful . It goes too far for laughs , that never actually come . Ben Stiller is unfunny , and the rest of the cast are uninspired . Even Sarah Jessica Parker , who usually makes even the least entertaining film passable . The clichés are all there : best friends who should be together but can't see it , the main guy is infatuated with someone who doesn't know that he exists , etc . No new ideas or even semi-interesting presentation of old stuff . Parker plays a therapist , and I couldn't help but think of how happy I am that I don't have a therapist like that . She should seriously be fired , and have a letter of . . . uh . . . un-recommendation written that should be mandatory reading for every future possible boss . Yes , she's that bad . There's a scene of her giving children advice , and she charges them . She takes the money of young children . . . I'll let that sink in . Both of the main characters are annoying and at times despicable , so I suppose they fit together quite nicely . One final criticism : why is it , that no Hollywood film can contain a favorable of an artist , particularly a painter ? Here he's presented as a childish , eccentric moron . Is that supposed to be funny ? Final thought : only reason to see this film is to see the young and ( already then ) talented actress Scarlett Johansson in a very little role as a young child . I recommend this to women who don't care about the quality of romantic comedies and no one else . In fact , I urge you to avoid this at any and all cost , if you don't belong to aforementioned group . Yes , it's that bad . Believe me .
Horrid writing , deplorable casting and acting that would make B-movie actors look away in shame	Seldom do you see a movie that looks so bad from the beginning , that no matter how many fanatics tell you it's great , no matter how often the thought that it might actually not be that bad hits you , it doesn't even in the least affect that deep down , in your core , you know it will be just as bad as you knew from the start . This is one such movie . I've spent the last twenty or so minutes searching for something , anything in the film that should , nay , must raise the rating above the absolute lowest score I could give it . . . with no luck . The plot makes little to no sense . It's clearly just put together in order to bring the comic book characters to the big screen . It also seems like the writer ( s ? ) didn't have more than one idea for the script , so he just reused it over and over . One of the members are unhappy . . . start a fight , get angry , leave . That takes place two or three times during the film , with little to nothing separating them . Just as they get back together , someone new is discontent . That's not a film , that's a bunch of different takes on the same short stitched together to reach minimum length for a feature film . The pacing seems non-existent . Scenes go on and on , and there's no telling how far you are from the end . The acting is mostly bad . The casting is completely off , for pretty much ( did I say pretty much ? Scratch that ) every character . Susan Storm as a mulatto ? Reed Richards as a thirty-something ? What is wrong with you people ? Also , let me just make it clear , I'm not a fan of the comics whatsoever . I loathe their powers , I hate Johnny Storm and I despise how much everyone else ( other superheroes included ) look up to them . So I'm not one to criticize inaccuracies . But come on ! The writing is incredibly poor . There are lines that make no sense , lines that have no humor to them whatsoever , and lines that make you cringe . . . guess the writer knew it was poor and decided to just throw in everything he could . To give a quick example , one character says , in full seriousness , to describe another person : " You're such a dork ! " Yes , honestly . Character motivations and development just isn't there . Look for it as hard as you will , it ain't there . The humor rarely ever works , and is completely juvenile in tone and nature . The writers come up with one or two scenes that have attractive actors of both genders undressing , for no other reason than eye-candy . Just for anyone who cares , no , there's no nudity , and the two actors are Jessica Alba and Chris Evans . Sure , she's hot ( and I'm certain most females would think that description is fitting for Evans ) , but when there's no point to it whatsoever , it just leaves you feeling offended as a viewer . For a comic book movie , there's nearly no super-villain action whatsoever . . . there's one fight , and it's very short , at the very end . That's all , folks . Now , since there should be some positive stuff in any review , no matter how negative it is . . . Julian McMahon is great as Dr . Victor Von Doom , and he may actually even be well-cast . I love him as a villain , from seeing him on Charmed for several years , and he repeats the success here . Problem is , he has way too little to do , and far too little screen-time . Then there's the special effects . . . I can't deny that most of them look great . Still , those two things aren't enough to bring this above bottom rating . Less offensive to the fans than Spiderman , but more poorly produced . Just bad in pretty much every way . Keeps some of the comic book tone , but not one to make a point of seeing . I recommend this to special effects junkies and people who care just enough about the comics to see the movie , but still little enough to accept the many inaccuracies . No real fan should be subjected to it , unless he or she can accept how much they screw up . Again , it's not as bad as Spiderman on that front , but it's still pretty bad .
One of those action films which are barely worth sitting through , and are instantly forgotten	You know those really bad action films of the late 80's and early 90's ? Some of them had big star names like Stallone , Schwarzenegger , Willis or Norris . This one only has semi-known Billy Drago , and everyone else are just no-names ( I certainly didn't recognize anyone else ) . The film has just about every action-cliché known to man ; the tough guy hero , the female lead who can't do anything at all by herself , and is merely there to give the hero someone to save , the bad guy who's like the meanest damn SOB you could possibly imagine ; not only is he a killer , a terrorist and an A-hole , he's also a rapist . The male lead was probably chosen for the role because he has muscles and a ridiculously deep voice . The female lead was chosen because she's attractive , willing to do nudity , and because she can look helpless and attractive at the same time . The action is straightforward with no surprises . The plot is ridiculous and unoriginal . The acting is laughable . The characters are clichés and stereotypes . The film is thoroughly predictable and the action is so simple and unexciting that its only possible use is eye-candy . All in all , the film has nothing at all to offer . Everyone should just avoid this . . . unless of course you're a really big fan of B-movies . I recommend this solely to fans of B-movies . Everyone else should just avoid this .
Eh . . . wake me up when it's over . . .	When Jean-Claude Van Damme is starring in a film , you're already preparing for something bad , but this might actually be the worst film he's made , as it's more than just bad ; it's excruciatingly bad . It's not the worst film ever made , but it's close . For an action / martial arts movie , the fighting / action sequences are very tame and far between . The plot is laughable at best , and full of holes . The acting is painfully bad . The characters are badly written stereotypes , not to mention that the film obviously tries incredibly hard to implement all of the characters from the video-games in the movie , which results in far too many characters , and far too many supposedly interesting characters are pushed into the background and settle for cameos , to make way for the more popular characters . The dialog is awful . The script is horribly badly written . The " humor " is childish and lame . The film has so many unintentionally funny scenes that it must be a record of some kind . The fight sequences are predictable and , like I mentioned earlier , tame . There are also far too few of them , considering that it's supposed to be the driving point of the film , rather than the predictable and badly written plot . The film really doesn't have anything to offer , honestly . I recommend it only to huge fans of Van Damme , and kids / teens with nothing better to do than watch some badly choreographed fights by Van Damme and various badly trained actors . Everyone else , find a better way to kill 90 minutes and skip this one .
Not even particularly good for a B-movie	From the very first frame of this film to the very last , it's completely obvious that it's a B-movie . A modern , low-budget , direct-to-video no less , action-B-movie . As a follow-up to the first , it's very bad . It turns the plot and theme of the first completely around . The plot is lame , and very unoriginal . The acting is horrible ; there were times when it felt like a comedy , or a parody of the first . The characters are badly written cliches , derived from war movies and other B-movies . The cinematography is amateurish and lesser than that of the typical level of early film-student test film ( believe me , it really is that bad ) . The director ( or possibly the director of photography , or maybe the cameramen ) seems to have a fetish for pointless and very quick zooming shots , and there seems to be quite a lot of camera angles that are zoomed much too far in . I also hated a few of the pan shots , but there were not as many as the zoom shots , and they were somewhat far between . The special effects are quite awful , though there were one or two effects that looked decent . The heroism and stereotyping of the main character / hero is ludicrous . I couldn't stop laughing at the scenes where he tries to look heroic . The whole film is quite laughable . The attempts at humor are cringe-worthy , and almost every scene that is supposed to inspire fear , tension or horror , inspired laughter and mockery instead . The dialog is ridiculous , and very badly written . The action is tame and never really intense . The horror elements are derivative of several much better movies , and generally don't work like they're supposed to , for various reasons ( bad special effects , bad acting , bad camera angle ) . I know that this was direct-to-video , low-budget , and was possibly even intended as a B-movie , but come on , you can do better than this . Almost anyone could . I would guess that , given the same budget ( about six million dollars , I think ) , I could have supplied a better , more interesting 90 minute flick . None of the limitations can be used to excuse how bad the film is . Direct-to-video ? Please . So was Children of the Corn IV and American Psycho 2 , and at least they were somewhat entertaining and much more professionally made . Low budget ? Two words : El Mariachi . B-movie ? Honestly . . . there are plenty of much more entertaining B-movies out there . Take Barb Wire , for example . All in all , a pretty bad film , but fans of B-movies might enjoy it . I recommend this only to fans of B-movies , and people who wished the first had been more like a B-movie . Fans of the first should stay away . I don't regret watching this , though . It was good for a laugh , and knowing that it's so bad is better than wondering about it . If you somehow , as a fan of the first , see this movie , try to think of it as comic relief , a spoof of the first . It'll soften the blow .
They even managed to find a less tolerable kid	I don't love the original . Nor am I one to claim that the only way a remake can be good is if it doesn't deviate from its source in the slightest . Heck , I'm not even going to insist that the atmospheric , deliberately paced , skillfully built up method of the ' 80 film is the only way to do this . What I am going to argue is that if you're going to copy as much of what you're going by as this does , you might want to try for a similar overall feel to it . You know , as opposed to just taking all that seemed to work that time around and stringing together scenes so as to allow for about all you can possibly muster of them , with the occasional change . Honestly , even that far , this doesn't completely lose . No , I think where this completely tanks , if you ignore the way some of the " creepy " situations come off supposedly commonplace ( ? ) to the leads , the lazy and obvious delivering of exposition ( was any attempt at all made to conceal it ? ) for quite a bit of it , the apparent lack of memorable lines as well as even a single genuinely impressive performance . . . no , where it ceases forward momentum is in one simple , unfortunate attribute : It ain't scary . Not particularly , if at all . It's not the PG-13 ; The Ring did masterful with the same rating . It's not directed with the proper understanding and care for horror . I haven't seen anything else by Wainwright , but I imagine Carpenter could take him to school on the genre . For now , us fans will have to re-watch classics , as the most terrifying thing in the current world of movies is how significantly awful the majority of the recent ones are . I recommend this mainly as MST3K fodder , and / or for those members the young crowd who are satisfied with music and slang that's in , as well as half-naked members of the other gender scampering around .
It's not as much the fact that the joke is repeated until we're more than just sick and tired of it as much as the fact that it was never funny in the first place	Here it is . The ( dear sweet god I certainly hope so ) last Chucky film . The last of the films , and the first that I've truly disliked . Wait , disliked ? Scratch that , flat-out hated every second of . The film is a comedy more than anything else , and instead of coming up with many good jokes , as every competent comedy writer would , Don Mancini takes the easy way out and jumps on the bandwagon with what Hollywood says is funny right now and writes just a few poor jokes and repeats them over and over . . . and over . The kid thinking he's Japanese and being gender-confused , Chucky killing , Tiffany trying not to kill . . . etc . When exactly did Tiffany turn sappy , by the way ? In the previous one , she actually yelled at a Goth guy for not having killed anyone . This time , she acts like Chucky was why she killed . Everything about this film is just so poorly done . We've got a kid doll that won't stop wetting himself ; a rapper / black guy stereotype ; crude sex gags and jokes forced so far down our throat that they're enough to make even the most tolerant person gag and a film that is basically making fun of all the earlier installments . . . and I , for one , am not laughing . The plot is ridiculous . The pacing is even worse than the previous two . . . it's freaking intolerable . The acting is incredibly poor . The characters are very poorly written and all clichéd and stereotypical . About half of them are actually just there to act as victims or running gags . . . or both . The dialog is immensely poorly written . The humor is awful . . . the comical timing is constantly off , and the punchlines are forced . Honestly , there's just nothing in the film to make it worth watching , apart from possibly the biggest of Child's Play / Chucky fans . I recommend this only to the very biggest Chucky fans , and I advise anyone else , everyone else to avoid this , or at the very least , approach with caution . I doubt I'll ever watch it again , and I can think of tons of very bad movies that I've seen several times .
And here I thought it couldn't possibly get any worse	After watching this travesty of a slasher , this disappointment of epic proportions , I'm left with unbelievably low expectations for the rest of the Halloween series . After watching the fourth , I had trouble believing it could actually get any worse . I was wrong . This movie is so bad , it's seriously hard to sit through . In fact , the thing that kept me watching was sitting and pointing out all of the bad things in it ; I don't think there was more than a minute or two of the film where it isn't cliche-filled & hideously unrealistic . A little while into the film , we are introduced to the most annoying character in any movie ever , in the form of Wendy Kaplan , and you instantly start hoping , maybe even praying , that she dies very soon , and very slowly . Unfortunately , we are not so lucky on either . Danielle Harris who was at least some of a 3-dimensional character in the fourth , is now reduced to a constantly sobbing , crying little girl , who is now even more helpless than she was in the last . Avoid at all costs , unless you really are a Halloween completist .
Not a bad idea , but unsatisfying execution	I guess my first mistake was to pick this up at Blockbuster without ever having heard of anything about it ( including title ) before . Luckily , this was also my last , as I didn't make the common mistake of expecting equal talent and entertainment value from all films I watch . I quickly recognized this as the turkey it is , and as soon as I lowered my expectations considerably , I found it to be more enjoyable than I had first anticipated when I saw the rating ( here on IMDb ) and the first couple of scenes . It's not a good film , but it's not the worst one out there . The basic idea behind it is not half bad , and I found my search for inconsistencies and anachronisms to come up with ( almost ) nothing . Martin Sheen does pretty good as Dillinger , the former gangster turned farmer who wants to stay out of the gangster " business " . F . Murray Abraham does OK as Capone , but having seen Robert DeNiro himself portray the character , he comes off a little flat by comparison . Jeffrey Combs is highly entertaining as a former FBI agent that survives quite a lot . The plot has some gaping holes ( mainly dealing with how little police response there seems to be throughout the whole thing , and some typical action-film good - guys - aiming - much - better - than - bad - guys stuff ) and the writing leaves a bit to be desired . The effects are obviously cheap , and several points during the film , an explosion or a Molotov cocktail is thrown in ( pun intended ) to raise the production value . Despite these low points , the film stays relatively true to historical events and does manage to entertain you and somewhat keep your interest . For an action film , there's relatively little action . For a crime movie , there's relatively little real crime . For a drama , there's little real drama . In the end , it's just another one of those " could have been better " films . But it's one of the less disappointing of the sort , and not completely devoid of talent . I suggest you check it out , if you're very much into gangster films . It's a fairly entertaining little piece ; just don't expect any depth or a message . I recommend this only to the biggest fans of gangster films , and only those who can sit through what would commonly be referred to as a ' bad ' film .
Movie ? It barely moves at all	The film opens with music which borders on being painful to the viewer's ears , and an angle that is somewhat unpleasant ( and doesn't mean to be ) to them , which nicely sets the tone of generally not being appealing . At an early point , a car stalls . . . the film itself does so from start to finish , never getting off the ground . I was never engaged in it . This was my second viewing , and I see that while my tastes may have matured over the years , my instinct on this one was spot-on . I have not read the book , but I could see it being impeccably superior to this , and I urge anyone to go for that , instead . There's been murder in Gorky Park , but the victim is not time , in fact , that old beardo seems to have decided to slow down for the duration of this , at points to a complete , motionless crawl . The plot isn't bad as such , it just never got my attention , or managed to invoke anything resembling a feeling , in fact , nothing more than boredom and a basic interest in everything that isn't the film . The pacing is , I don't know , is it there , at all ? Does it exist ? The acting isn't all bad , but when it's bad , it shows . I've no problem with Hurt ( though I do prefer John ) , and even Palpatine and Dennehy can't keep you watching ( well , they couldn't , me ) . Marvin seems to be a great actor , but even he cannot make the line " I've got a hat and you don't " work . The dialog has little positive to offer . The music isn't all dreadful , same for the cinematography , and editing , the latter two just tend to be disinterested , boring and lazy . Shots last too long , and there are too few of them . I'm not sure what more there is to say . I hope this , my second viewing , will be the last . Sometimes , movies are on sale for a reason . Oh well , at least it didn't cost too much . I recommend this to those who refuse to skip any movie featuring their favorite actors ( provided at least one of them is in this , obviously ) , and those who need motivation to get up and do something , and finally insomniacs .
Portrait ? Sounds classy	This is the second featurette on the DVD of The Andromeda Strain , the other being a making-of . This is Crichton , in one interview , occasionally intercut with clips from the movie , and still material . He talks about his early writing career , med school , worrying what the professors would think of him if they knew he was , or was trying to be , an author next to learning to be a doctor . Extra attention and focus is of course paid to and placed on the film , and the novel behind it , and the latter being turned into the former . It's all informative enough , if not necessarily terribly interesting , unless you want a brief history of how he started putting words on the page . He doesn't go into very much detail about other works , nor concepts or such . This is little more than an extended commercial for the feature , really . I would wager there are more interesting and thorough biographies , and that they might even hold actual analysis . If one only watched this and his appearance in the behind-the-scenes production on the disc , they would not get a very positive view of him . I recommend this to fans of the man , I suppose , and not sure who else .
Has a lot the first didn't , but is missing what made that one what it was	I think that really says it . This is just lacking a certain something . It does have things that are new to the series , but are they positive , and / or do they fit ? I realize that Landis does fantasy sometimes , and , hey , I'm not saying that can't be great , it's not a genre I'm into , but I have enjoyed an effort or more within it , and it can be done well and right , as I would say all forms of expression can . With that said . . . did he feel it fit , here ? The first may have had elements , but they were so toned down and could be rationalized away by those of us not big on that . Also , the original had a point . What were they headed for , here , where were they going ? The modernization and overdoing didn't help any , and this time , everything seems possible and at the fingertips of the leads . There's not a trace of a sense of danger . Finally , the kid . . . honestly , he's not bad . No , I mean that . One would think that would be the fatal blow , but save for the very end , he's seldom-to-never irritating ( to me , anyway ) . An instantly obvious , and well-known , shortcoming , here , is of course Belushi ( R . I . P . ) . Him not being there is acknowledged , but where does the line go ? Surely before so many in the cast have had condoling the loss be one of their first pieces of dialog that the viewer can't help but wonder why they made this in the first place . In fact , why did they ? Elwood can't carry this on his own , he was part of a duo . It's not that I have a problem with Aykroyd . Not even a little , I admire him elsewhere . He just doesn't have the " other person " here , to spar with , to play off of . He also seems to have forgotten how to write and play the character ( heck , that last one goes for the whole bunch , at least to a degree ) , with the result that he's turned into a parody of himself . The pacing is surprisingly tolerable . This is partially a remake , with one scene after the other that mimic the ' 80 one , if the order isn't the same . They didn't feel sorted , this time , or carefully arranged , but instead merely thrown together , as to avoid messing up the formula . The same goes for the song choices . . . I'd guess they went with what they wanted , rather than what actually fit . I didn't care for the pieces as much , but to each his own ( and they do put some new styles in this ) . The direction isn't bad as such , it's just not engaging . The car-chases really took a nosedive . Where they were detailed and downright operatic in the one preceding this , they seem decidedly uninspired here . One bit , they seemed content with simply tossing the vehicles into the view of the camera , over and over , with the sophistication only equalled by a young bully kicking down a sand-castle . This in general wasn't fun , or funny , in my opinion . It is absolutely tasteless at one point . It gets too far out , slapstick and cartoonish . It boils down to that this seems like a largely aimless , if finely edited and shot , long music video . So , did they mainly want to put something that could be described as that up on the silver screen ? If so , hey , good for them , they succeeded . This also stooped to the level of gratuitous sexuality , if no nudity , in more than one sequence . It contains some language , fairly harsh . The DVD holds a theatrical trailer , production photos and notes , posters and a making of . I recommend this to . . . fans of the tunes , I suppose . I'll admit that this isn't the worst flick out there , but as a sequel , it's quite underwhelming .
Why would he have John Travolta's smile ?	Who was this film made for ? Can't be the kids , as much as they might enjoy all of the , albeit not really visually graphic , gross-out comedy , seeing as how there are some fairly intimidating sequences throughout ( and the language isn't exactly child-proof , either , though it could be worse ) . The focus is entirely on the single mother and her child , so few men will ( willingly ) watch . No , this seems to have been made explicitly for the group that the main character belongs to , 30-something single mothers who , in spite of being smart , make stupid decisions ( which will annoy women not in that group , I would guess ) . I watched this for the first time in years , and it's really almost sad how little of it I remembered or recognized . The plot , I suppose , isn't awful , and realistic enough ( disregarding the entire premise of the child " talking " ) , but it does seem like they merely made up just enough to bring it to 90 minutes , and to tie together the various scenes of the toddler in situations that such would find themselves in , with Bruce Willis doing a voice of what the kid might be thinking / trying to say ( well , at least it's not as bad as Garfield , where sometimes , Jon seems to understand the Tabby perfectly , whereas others , he isn't picking up anything but the fact that his lazy pet is trying to communicate ) , so that the whole movie wasn't just of that ( that would have been unbearable , even Hollywood couldn't have asked that of human beings ) . The humor usually doesn't work . There was maybe one brief point I found amusing , and that was it . The joke of every bit that has Willis doing the voice is that as far back as the womb ( which we get a visual of . . . because that's what we movie-goers are just dying to see ) , our offspring are intelligent , well-spoken . . . really , the only thing Mikey isn't shown to have , for obvious reasons , is experience . The instances of him talking will amuse some , but once that wears off , you'll find that it's really not funny . At all . The film plods along , at a pace that at times almost seems like a psychological experiment . . . " how much will the viewers take , before they stop watching " , with the occasional nightmare . Good pieces of music are used in the movie , where the choice of that particular song is downright frighteningly obvious . And this got two sequels and a TV show . I recommend this to those who find themselves in the group for which this film was intended . . . whatever it is .
So bad , it's almost a parody of the first	I saw this again , earlier tonight , after having seen the first Hellraiser and really liked it . I have seen it once before , and that time I couldn't take it seriously . It's just so far-fetched and bizarre and poorly made that I couldn't help but laugh . Due to that being so long ago , and the fact that I had seen the first and understood the idea much better , I decided to give it another chance . A few minutes into the film , I think : " OK , repetition of the story of the first for new viewers . Good . " Few minutes more , I think " OK , the story is starting , and looking a little bit interesting . " Then , I started to notice more and more flaws , glaringly obvious ones , even . I start to laugh , and I keep laughing . Not because it's funny , per se , but because it's so poorly done and the plot is ridiculous . About 45 minutes into the film , I realize one of the main reasons the film doesn't inspire even a little fear ; the scariest thing about it , as I noted to my friend who was watching it with me , is the very fact that the best actor in the film is the teenage girl ( Tiffany ) . The plot barely makes sense , and seems like it was mainly thought up to bring back all of the popular characters from the first film ; the Cenobites , Julia , Frank and Kirsty . Half of the film has a cheap repeating of the plot of the first ; a resurrected person who needs to kill people for their skin . Then it becomes pushed aside while the characters all run around a huge maze being chased by poor effects and laughable gore . The acting is atrocious . I don't think any of the main characters had more than one facial expression each . The characters are poorly written and the ones that return from the first are pale shadows of their characters in the far better first film . The dialog is ludicrous . The new Cenobite that is introduced has one-liners that would Arnold himself cringe . The effects are really bad , though a few have improved since the first . The thing that really ruins this film , though , is the direction . Hellraiser was based on Clive Barker's book , and having him directing it . . . he put his vision onto the big screen , and it was good . Here , his vision doesn't really shine through ( well , it might through some of the imagery , but certainly not the direction and ' terror factor ' ) and he apparently didn't even get to write this movie ( apart from the story . . . which I suspect was much better before it was turned into a script ) . A laughable attempt at a horror film and a worthy sequel to Hellraiser . I recommend it only to the biggest fans of horror and Hellraiser . . . and possibly to people just looking for a good laugh .
Far too few of the gags and jokes actually work , and I for one am saddened to see that Mel Brooks has taken the Zucker brothers ' route to comedy	To say that I expected a lot from this film would at best be half a truth . . . after all , Leslie Nielsen has a major role in it , and he's never made me laugh before . But then again , this was written and directed by Mel Brooks , who usually makes me laugh quite a lot . But somehow , he just doesn't cut it this time . I'm not sure where exactly he went wrong , but the worst decision he made on this film was to make it a spoof film Zucker brothers style , meaning poorly done gags and jokes that rely on childish humor , horrid over-acting and repeated jokes all over the place . The plot is decent enough . The acting is satisfactory , except for the parts that are hideously overacted . The humor is puerile , and most , if not all , of the gags and jokes are based on sex or stupidity . Very Zucker . At least there were hardly any ' bodily functions ' based gags , or I wouldn't have watched this whole film . I don't think I laughed more than once during this film , which is an all-time low for a Mel Brooks flick . One particular scene had Dracula hypnotizing two people into doing different things at the same time , leading to them doing what the other was supposed to be doing , which made me laugh a good deal . Other than that , though , there were no real laughs , no , not even a chuckle every now and then . Brooks reuses several cast-members from earlier films ( mainly Robin Hood : Men in Tights ) , among others Amy Yasbeck , Mark Blankfield and Megan Cavanagh . All in all , just not a particularly entertaining spoof of Dracula films . I recommend this to fans of Leslie Nielsen and the Zuckers , and , to a much , much lesser degree , Mel Brooks .
Tedious , overlong , with " hope " being the second word spoken in just about every sentence . . . who cares ?	I simply fail to understand how this film is so popular . . . it's quite simply beyond me . The only way I can explain it is that all the fans of King's short story found it very true to the spirit of the book , and voted 10 for that . I really could not find anything worth my time in this film , and apart from a very good monologue from Freeman near the end , one or two good lines of dialog and the acting , there's really nothing in the whole film worth watching it for . It's about hope . . . and the director won't let us forget it , so it's repeated until the audience mumbles it in our sleep . It's like this short , one-note story was written , and the author just didn't want to end it . . . so he kept writing . . . and writing . . . until someone had the sense to break down the door and wrestle the pen from him yelling " for the love of all that is holy , stop writing ! " And I thank that faceless man for doing that , because it is undoubtedly the only reason the film was 142 minutes long , and not 284 , or , dare I say it , 568 . The film simply drones on and on , scene after scene , containing nothing remotely interesting ( but with excellent acting , mind you ) . There's nothing good about this film except for the acting . Just about all of it is great . I can't really think of anything else to say . . . I guess my dislike for the film stems from my hatred of King's writing . I suppose it is possible for someone who is neutral on his works to enjoy this film . I recommend this to fans of Stephen King , the actors and possibly Frank Darabont . If you're not a fan of any of these people , I doubt you'd find this enjoyable .
Entertaining little vigilante action flick	This film starts out with a bang . . . literally . We see a huge explosion . Then one more . And another one . And yet another one . . . and this goes on for a while ; I don't know exactly how many explosions there are , just in the first two minutes , but the movie wastes no time , that's for sure . Then there are a few sequences of Vietnam , and soon thereafter , the real plot begins . As it did , I couldn't help but wonder : how many action films have an Vietnam vet ( short for veteran . . . obviously , as I doubt that there were many animals , and thereby veterinarians , in the Vietnam war ) as the hero , especially in the time right after the war ended . This is exceptionally violent , and the violence is almost disgustingly gratuitous . However , it's mostly also so over-the-top that it almost winds up having a comical effect . Regardless , no one who thinks they might be freaked out by the violence should see it . The plot is decent . A Vietnam vet snaps and starts killing a bunch of criminals systematically after his friend is attacked . He kills a very large amount of various criminals , half of them not having anything to do with his friend at all . I enjoyed the vigilante theme , and found it far more interesting than the usual Hollywood pretty-boy out to save the world from a terrorist from some country the American director can barely even pronounce . The acting is ridiculously bad . Only one actor , the one portraying the main character , can be said to give a decent performance . . . and even that's a stretch . The humor is decent . The action is pretty good , but the daft filming and editing manages to make several of the sequences seem dull . The cinematography and editing is unimaginative . The dialog is the typical 80's one-liner crap half of the time , and the rest of the dialog is either filler or something hinting at a point or a moral that never seems to appear . Overall , a decent 80's action exploitation flick . I recommend it to fans of 80's action films , but be warned that's it very violent .
Just not good , no matter how you look at it . . .	I have seen this film more times than I've bothered to count . . . meaning , at least twice ( had you going there , didn't I ? Bet you thought I had seen it hundreds of times ) . Yes , twice that I'm sure of . You know how I know ? Because I recognized one scene . One scene . 110 minutes worth of film , and I recognized a mere five minutes or less of it . This movie is just not worth your time ; I can imagine the novels are quite exciting and interesting ( I dig cyberpunk ; William Gibson is a genius . . . if you're a fan of the genre and haven't read his Cyperspace Trilogy and / or Virtual Light yet , do so , now ) , but the film . . . well , isn't . The plot is a mess , full of twists that barely make sense ( and definitely don't keep your interest ; rather the opposite ) . The pacing is dreadful . I still can't bring myself to watch more than a few minutes at a time without shifting my attention to something else . The acting is fair ; Woods is solid , as always . Stone and Stallone are decent . The characters are not particularly interesting or well-developed , and the viewers don't really care much about what happens to them , or why . The action scenes are not very involving , apart from the one I mentioned , the one scene I remembered . It's a short fight taking place in a bus , and it's quite reminiscent of Arnold himself . Some cool one-liners in that scene , too . Very macho , very bad-ass . I've read that Steven Seagal was offered a chance to star ( and direct , too ; I guess it's true what they say , an accident never comes alone ) . While I doubt that this film could have been much worse , I'm still glad that didn't happen . All in all , this just isn't really worth your time . . . unless you're a huge fan of someone involved with making it , I suppose . I recommend this only to the biggest fans of Sylvester Stallone , Sharon Stone and / or James Woods . Everyone else should probably just skip this one . You won't be missing anything , trust me .
I would think that even Chuck Norris has standards , but , apparently , I was wrong	I can't say very much positive about this film ; it's pretty much the typical , average action film , but it has so many horrendously bad parts and so unbelievably few good parts that it can only just be classified as average . Had it been slightly worse , it wouldn't even have gotten the 5 I'm giving it , which is even partly due to my being in a good mood now . The plot is nearly non-existent , as well as it's lifted straight out of plenty of other , better action movies . The pace is painfully slow ; the film is incredibly hard to sit through . The acting is laughable . The characters are poorly written , ill-conceived cliches . Even the soundtrack / score is bad . There was a point where I actually burst out laughing from the sheer stupidity of the soundtrack , and the directors poorly done , entirely failed attempt at creating the slightest bit of atmosphere . The direction is lazy and uninventive . The cinematography is forgettable , and often looks like the cameraman is asleep . The action is decent , but often far too gory for a regular type of action film ; if it was thriller / action or horror / action , sure , but not regular action . Guys don't see action movies to see throats being cut in graphic detail , or people coughing up ridiculous amounts of blood ; they watch it to see people blowing each other away with guns and / or explosives . And what the hell was up with the knees being blown away in that last scene ? It's not that it was so poorly done ( which it certainly was ) , it's that it's completely unnecessary . We neither expect nor want to see such gruesome violence in a standard action film . The dialog is ludicrously bad , and often unintentionally funny . I'm also baffled at what the point or message of the fight between the two kids was supposed to be ; I get that the father was the reason for the kid being violent , and that violence only spawns more violence , but what the hell did Chuck punch the guy for , then ? Won't that make him ( and , in turn , his kid ) more violent , then ? Ridiculous . The plot twists were also ludicrous , especially in the last couple of scenes where people seemed to change sides back and forth constantly . I can imagine many guys considering renting or maybe even ( heaven forbid ) buying this garbage because of the cover , and , more importantly , the bad-ass gun that Norris is packing , on the cover . Believe me , I understand where you're coming from ; and I made that mistake . I bought this film ( cheap , don't worry ; very , very cheap ) because I ( like you ) expected Norris to deal out some heavy punishment with the double-barrel shotgun . I'm afraid I have to disappoint you ; he uses it in three scenes , and only of them is somewhat entertaining ( not particularly much , though ) . This film really isn't worth any of your time or money . I suggest that if you do get a chance to watch it ( at no cost whatsoever and you don't have anything else to do for those 90 minutes ) , try to think of it as a comedy ; listen to the laughable dialog and music , laugh at the bad acting and the horrible script . It'll make it so much easier . Try it ; I did . And that's probably the only reason that I can be so calm about this mess , er , movie . I recommend this only to huge action and / or Chuck Norris fans . Everyone else should avoid it .
Such a waste of potential	You know , this could have been amazing . Ninjas , Marvel characters , and a story that could have been grand . This could have been downright epic . Had it been handled right . Directed by Rob Bowman , the man who brought us Reign of Fire , this takes a much more supernatural route than its parent film , Daredevil , for better or for worse . I must admit that I don't know much about Elektra of the comics . . . so I can't say for sure whether or not all the magic seen in this film is close to the source . They got the costume more or less right , and had they gone further towards the comics , the film might have garnered ( pun intended ) ( even more ) embarrassed reactions from its viewers . And she is actually an assassin in the film , which is accurate . I'm not sure about the efforts made to make the character still be likable to the audience . She is joined by Stick and The Hand . . . now , I don't know much about the former ( not sure I've read more than one comic that he appeared in ) , but the latter could so easily have provided a magnificent story , that it's almost a travesty what they did put on the screen . Also with her is someone named McCabe , who wins us over early by inquiring about the title character's sex life , in a manner that leaves the viewer wondering if he knows the meaning of the word subtlety ( although , to be fair , it may be the people behind the film itself who do not ) . The Millers are hardly better . Mark wouldn't be awful if he had just a hint of personality . Abby . . . frankly , it may be possible to scientifically prove that she is annoying . Granted , she isn't the most irritating that she could be , and there are times where she isn't , where she is tolerable , but being that she's one of the characters we're supposed to care the most about , she could have used work . It doesn't help that the kid isn't that great an actress . The production design isn't that memorable . I'm not sure the film holds even a single truly great image . The camera-work varies , but more often than not , it obscures the action , and it's in cahoots with the editing in this . Some parts are overly stylized . Many chances of actual action are passed up for showing us visual effects and magic instead . I'm afraid I can't claim that I'd rather see a man in a suit pull a rabbit , cute though it may be , out of his hat , than a skilled martial artist dish out some well-administered punches and kicks . The fighting is a mixed bag , but some of it is fairly good . Why there is so reasonably little of it ( and hardly any mêlée weapons ) , in a film about ninjas is a rather appropriate question . Dialog , writing , acting , none of it is particularly mesmerizing . The film seems to present some of its plot as twists , in spite of much of it having been revealed in the trailer , and what little there was left , the viewer could easily piece together on their own . Magical powers seem inconsistent , and the film doesn't possess much of an ability to keep the viewer excited or engaged . There's too little of a sense of danger . I recommend this to fans of fantasy , and those who simply must watch everything that has to do with comic books ( believe me , I don't blame you , it is difficult to find anything good ) . Those who like the comics , martial arts , and / or Daredevil the film should maybe think twice , at least before spending much money or energy to watch this .
Contains an obscene amount of ' fake ' scares and not much plot , but a worthy sequel	Following the success of the first Child's Play Don Mancini was asked to write a sequel . Not much later , he was asked to write a third film of the franchise . He said it impacted his writing , as he was out of ideas after writing this one . Well , how many ideas did he have before , exactly ? The first had a fairly good plot , but this has the unlucky fate of being the second film in a series of films that started with an idea that only really allowed for one film . The same could be said of Terminator 2 , but James Cameron worked that out nicely , by directing a sequel that was almost a remake . But enough about that . Where this movie goes wrong plot-wise is by using a cheap ploy to put Andy , our main character , in basically the exact same situation that he was in the first film ; knowing that the doll was alive but no one believing him . That worked well in the first film , partly because we weren't sure if Chucky was alive for a while . Here , it's just a cheap ploy to ensure that no one will help Andy . Of course , this installation also suffers under the curse of sequels to horror movies ; everything needs to be bigger ( because ' bigger is better ' ) . More deaths , more gruesome death scenes and , for some reason , more obscenities . It might be because Chucky talks more for this one , but he seemed to swear more randomly as well . And why was he suddenly so bloody lighthearted ? Early in the film , he seemed to laugh every five seconds . Anyway , the deaths are nicely done , and the fact that there are more of them doesn't bother me ( I am a horror fan , after all ) . It's more how they are virtually ignored or written off by characters in the film . In the first film , the deaths were few and far between , and they looked like accidents . Here , the bodies pile up , and it's clear to anyone that these are intentional killings . Which leads me to a gaping plot hole ; in the first , we were told that he was a psychopath and a killer . The killings weren't expanded upon . Here , we're told that he , being the voodoo aficionado that he is , killed them ritually . Now , if he did that when he was alive , why does he settle for just killing people now that he's dead ? I mean , he does go out of his way to kill people , but now he doesn't care about the voodoo stuff anymore ? What gives ? Now , as the one line summary of my comment tells you , this has grotesque amounts of ' fake ' scares . For anyone who doesn't know what that means , it's getting a cheap jump-scare out of the viewers through something that has nothing to do with the actual horror of the film . Cat jumping down from high point , friend appearing suddenly from behind character , etc . You know them , I know them , and we ( by ' we ' I mean us horror fans ) all hate them . The plot is somewhat good , what little there is of it , though too much of it is just to set up new Chucky scenes , either involving him going after Andy or killing off one or more of the many characters that have the words ' I'm going to be killed off ' printed on their foreheads from the moment we see them ( . . . not literally , of course ) . Which brings me to the point of the characters . They are somewhat well-written and credible , but they are in no way interesting or likable ( with the exception of Andy and Kyle ) , making them uninteresting victims ( where's the fun in seeing you don't care about getting killed ? ) and they , like the plot , are written around how Chucky acts , to protect him and his ' mission ' from interference . The acting is good enough , with Christine Elise and Alex Vincent , the kid who plays Andy being the only two who transcend the mediocre level of acting that everyone else seems to stay at . The special effects have clearly evolved quite a lot since the first , and it makes the Chucky scenes more pleasing to the eye . The end is about as overdone as the first one . All in all , probably only a film for the people who really liked the first . If you only ' kind of ' enjoyed the first , you probably won't like this one . . . unless you thought what the first lacked was more death and less plot . I recommend this to fans of the first and of horror in general . I don't advise anyone to watch this if you haven't seen the first yet , though . Not only is the first a better film , it sets the tone for this pretty well and contains a lot of plot that this doesn't summarize for new viewers .
Wait ! I was just getting to know you . . . !	This is a special feature on the 2-Disc DVD of Fight Club . Coming in at slightly under five and a half minutes , it can hardly be claimed that this overstays its welcome . It's quite concise , and the pacing certainly isn't bad , because it holds a fair bit of stuff , without ever overwhelming or boring the viewer . It's edited fine . It's sort of a fly-on-the-wall perspective , and there really are no interviews or the like , and the only times the camera documenting what's going on is acknowledged is when a crew-person / actor does something specifically for it , does something or other towards it , or notices it and throws the reflexive smile that people tend to when they realize they're being recorded and they , at the time , possess enough energy and care to do so . It's put together of a few clips from the film itself and footage from , you guessed it ( well , I sure hope you did ) , the locations . . . as opposed to studios or workshops ( right ? ) . If you haven't watched any other behind-the-scenes productions , you may not be able to figure out what's going on for much of it , and even if you have , it could be clearer . For what this is , it's decent . I recommend this to fans of the movie itself .
A good attempt at a spoof of action movies , but a little too long	This movie is a spoof of Arnie movies , featuring Arnie , parodying his own characters . The whole movie parodies all the typical action movies , mostly featuring Arnold himself . I find it a bit funny that he himself is willing to make fun of the characters that made him such a big action star in the first place . Unfortunately , parody fun put aside , the movie is a little too long ; it could have spoofed the action movies perfectly well , even if it had been 20-30 minutes shorter , and it probably would have benefited from that . The plot is OK , but it's mostly just an excuse for a lot of spoofing on action movie clichés . The acting is not bad , but not particularly good either . The characters are mostly stereotypes , made to make fun of the action movies . Most of the puns and one-liners have a good effect , as well as some of the " continuity errors " and clichés . The only real problem here is the length , and maybe the few in-jokes that fall flat . I think people wanting a spoof of the genre will like it , but most other people probably won't . I recommend this to anyone who likes Arnie films and who would like to see them spoofed .
I didn't find it all that funny , but others might	It's really no secret that I honestly don't particularly care for Steve Oedekerk . I don't like what he did to the few Jim Carrey films he was involved in ( one of them even being a sequel , and Carrey seldom does those at all . . . and that one followed a genuinely funny movie , to boot ) , and I hardly ever find his material funny . I will admit up front that I am really not in the intended audience for this short . That may be part of why I didn't enjoy it as much as others have ( and I am in no way trying to keep those who do , will or may enjoy this from watching it ) . The film seems to be typical to what Oedekerk makes . . . if you like his other work , you may very well enjoy it . There are a few bodily function jokes , and more often than not , his writing makes fun of itself . At least one joke fits both of the aforementioned criteria . Some of the material is clever . The scenes spoof the original movie ( which I could not stand ) well . The whole thing is , as the other thumb films ( apparently , this is the only one I've watched ) , acted out by thumbs ( yup ) with moving eyes and a mouth each . That is actually quite nicely done , and works throughout the almost half-hour run-time . The pacing isn't bad . I didn't hate this , but I'm not sure I'd ever watch it again . I recommend it to fans of Steve Oedekerk , his body of work and people who enjoy his style of humor .
Somewhat good gore , and absolutely nothing else	But what can you expect , from a slasher from the eighties ? The newer slashers mostly at least TRY to explain why the psychopathic killer IS a psychopathic killer . But , as said , the gore is very well done . Also , the movie progresses a lot faster than most of the slashers I've seen . Most of the plot is happening all at one single night . No slow days , wondering when the next one gets killed ; there's pretty much someone dying every tenth minute or so . And , it does give some decent shocks . The plot barely makes sense at all , and the twist-in-the-end is totally ridiculous . I gave this a , and the only thing that makes it that one point above average , is the gore . I don't know , see it if you like gore , and have absolutely nothing better to do , or any other gory movies to watch . Otherwise , avoid at all costs .
Actually one of those that did hold promise	Sequels have a bad name . There's reason for that . This one , however , can be deceptive : It starts out good . The very opening ? Magnificent . It's not unlikely that the casting people of Smallville had just seen that bit when they chose how to fill that role . Sadly , it doesn't last more than the minute or so . After that , there are glimpses , ideas , and here and there , it almost gets to be great . Alas , the rest of it weighs down , and I'd say that the ending is tasteless beyond anything that was in the first . Subtlety seems to have been the initial victim in the onslaught of graphic death in this . Verhoeven gave us a satire , where the social commentary flowed much smoother . . . like honey , although ( intentionally ) bitter . This contains dialog so exposition - and explain-happy , one's initial reaction if viewing the two in succession is pure disbelief . Granted , it's not going to go over people's heads . . . even if they're laying down . . . but is quality second to profit ? . . . well , it shouldn't be . This takes the route that other movies that join a franchise in progress have , where the predecessor asked the audience to take something seriously : It makes fun of it . While this goes for a cynicism similar to the real RoboCop film , and clearly does attempt to recreate the certain undefinable thing of it , it just never gets across the same bleakness . Some of the time , it seems to almost parody the original , and encourage us to lighten up with the visions of what may come , at other points it tries too hard at the dark tone , and becomes quite tough to swallow . It didn't even offer an imaginative villain . Did anyone not see coming what the form was going to be ? Furthermore , it's got to do with narcotics . . . how surprising , since the ' bad guy ' in the majority of entertainment pieces with a story were around this period wasn't at all a drug lord , a dealer , or a variation thereof . This didn't have to turn out this way . Irvin Kershner , director of the best ( definitely in my opinion ) Star Wars episode , helmed this . Frank Miller wrote for it . . . unfortunately , little of it was used ( other of that material was included in the third ) , and I suggest reading the comic based on it to any fan of his . There are characters with credibility and solid writing , at least sometimes . There are interesting concepts here . There's even a bona-fide , genuine scene that can be claimed to potentially invoke emotion in the audience . Nevertheless , the final product is so that I couldn't blame anyone for only watching the one prior to this , of the cinema-released depictions of ( this particular version thereof ) the future of law enforcement . Maybe this is the real reason Weller passed on the third . Failing that , perhaps he started reading the script of it and decided that life's too short . I recommend this mainly to those who want the entire series , and dreamers who wish to take it in and ponder what might have been . I wouldn't rule out that this could have become one of the few and seldom occurring follow-ups that do justice to what came before them .
Decent , but should have been better	My first though when I saw this was that it was the type of movie Jackie Chan would make ; sidekick that provides comic relief , hero with great martial arts capabilities and an equally strong enemy , corny , at times crude , humor , etc . Then again , I haven't really seen any other movies with Chow Yun-Fat , so I have no idea how his movies usually are ; but I think that given that this movie has so many similarities to a typical Chan movie , it should have been at least a little better ; Chan's movies always seem to have good comedy , entertaining martial arts fights , and a story that allows for plenty of both , without keeping the audiences attention at the plot for any minute over the complete run time of the film . This just seemed to fail at most of these ; the comedy is too much aimed at the teenager audience , apparently trying to cash in on the success of movies such as American Pie , with its innuendo and crude comedy . The martial arts seem to be inspired by Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon , which some people will probably say is a good thing ; not me , though . It's too athletic and looks more like dancing than fighting . It especially looks bad since some of it is far more aggressive and intense , which just makes the ballet-like fighting seem even more ridiculous . As for the story , it seems to try to learn you something new , make you think , but it ruins any potential it might have by constantly throwing some ( often bad-looking ) martial arts fight scene in your face , just as you're starting to think more about what Chow just said , which often will sound like something out of a fortune cookie . I also think the plot is too derivative of the same themes and ideas that also inspired The Matrix , which , being far more spectacular than this , will make this seem very inferior , even boarding on being a rip-off ( which I don't feel it is , but it tries too hard to learn you these things as if they had never been told before ) . I know that this is based on a comic book , but it seems too much like a bad excuse to put martial arts in a teenage comedy or vice versa . I don't know if this movie does the comic book any justice , but I wouldn't guess so . I do think that it is good that Seann William Scott and Jaime King performed their martial arts moves themselves , but , this has also been done in The Matrix , and here it seems more like a gimmick ( though I think it was the actors ' choice themselves ) . The plot is OK , but it just barely keeps your attention , and every attempt it does at doing anything else come off as pretentious . The acting is decent enough , nothing great , but not bad either . The characters are a little stereotypical , especially the villains , but they manage to surprise and interest you a little . All in all , a decent enough martial arts teen comedy , but should have been better . I recommend it to fans of teen comedies , martial arts and / or one of the two main actors , since this is probably them both at their best .
It's OK , but it could have been better	After I have played all the way through this game , I can't say I enjoyed playing it an awful lot ; the stealth portion of the game is decent , but the horrendous camera angles make it nearly impossible to get past ( and unnecessarily frustrating to try your wits at ) . The Hulk portions of the game are at least a little more entertaining , but unfortunately they are limited to only consisting of the player controlling the huge brute , smashing things into tiny bits and throwing people into walls and such ; nothing more is to be found here . It's fun at first , and they captured the style well ( which may be enough for those who read about him for the senseless destruction and havoc that the big green misunderstood monster wreaks . . . looking past the modern-day Frankenstein's Monster tale and the tortured soul within the beast ) , but it gets old pretty quick , since few of the enemies are difficult to beat , and being practically invincible doesn't keep being entertaining for an entire game . In fact , the lack of any tangible challenge pretty much ensures that it stops being fun within much , much too short a period of playing time . The graphics are very good , crisp and smooth , with solid animation , and I like the diversity that the environment offers ; you can pick up virtually any object and use it as a club , a throwing weapon or simply put it to good use , by smashing it directly over the next adversary's head . The controls are relatively simple , but at times you ( I certainly did ) wish that there had been more functions , as they only allow for reasonably few different ways of beating up your opponents ( which , again , makes it get boring long before the game is over . . . and it's supposed to be the main attraction of the thing ( honestly , the sneaking seems tacked on , more than anything ) ) . I think the story is OK ( though much of it seems as if it is written as an excuse to have a bunch of scenarios where the game can send endless swarms of mostly easily defeated enemies at you . . . and every so often turning The Hulk back into Bruce Banner , to put you through yet another insufferable stealth-level ) , it's kind of good that it picks up where the movie left off , but I think the numerous enemies , especially the bosses , were too much alike ; every other boss is just another giant creature a la the title character itself . Another good thing is that they use so many well-knowns from the graphic novel as enemies ; most fans will immediately recognize them . It's a pity that a game based on such a classic character , and one with such potential in many mediums , not just comic books ( which is the only place I've seen him flourish so far ) , has to be a by-the-books beat-'em-up title . This could have been an interesting and intense production where you try to keep Banner's tension level ( perhaps monitored through a meter in the HUD ( Heads-Up Display , a la the suspicion meters of the Hit-man series or similar ) down , to avoid turning into his unfriendly alter-ego and having to yet again live with more destroyed property , and possibly injured ( I don't believe he's ever actually killed anyone , though I haven't read too many of the more recent stories ) people . I'm not even particularly much of a fan of the character or the comic books . . . and that was just off the top of my head . Unfortunately , it would seem that the production company behind this fail to realize that not all comic book readers are children and / or have low standards . . . many of us appreciate depth , as well as thought and effort put into what we play , watch and read . This title is purely superficial . It looks and sounds nice , and it lets you control a fascinating creature , with all his physical strength and his impressive presence . If that is all you require of a game , then look no further . . . and good for you . I'm happy that some enjoy this game , but I'm afraid I was rather disappointed . The game is of reasonable length ( though it could have ended sooner , in my opinion . . . but I may have been too tired of it by that point ) . The levels are fairly different from each other , though all are entirely linear . The visual design stays quite true to the source material . . . the colors all seem to have the exact right tone , and going by my limited knowledge of the graphic novels , the villains all look right , as well ( and the choices aren't bad ) . In-between levels , there are animated cut-scenes that further the story , and I must admit , they are impressively done . The levels convey the sense that everyone's out to get you , which fits quite well with how the muscular and discolored man-like being must perceive the world , with his enormously limited intellect . If you accept that the game is a simple production that tries to do little more than put the player in the body of the title character , I suppose it's fine for what it is . It just feels like such a blatant attempt at cashing in on the popularity of the source material ( I may not particularly care for Ang Lee , but I'd still say that he at least tried to do something interesting in the film ) , and I generally disapprove of such . . . if you just want to have fun and for your audience to enjoy themselves , then make up your own thing ( or spoof someone else's ) , but if you're going to work from someone else's creation , show some respect and try to live up to the name and reputation of it . Overall , the game is OK if you loved the movie , or I suppose if you're a long-time fan , and one who's been waiting for a game for a long time . You just have to get used to the controls , and accept that the regular levels get tedious and repetitive very quickly . . . and that the Bruce Banner portions are overly difficult , due to a half-hearted attempt at programming a camera system .
Definitely has some to offer	This is something as rare as a film that while mainly ( and plainly ) aimed at children , to a remarkable degree avoids insulting anyone not of that age . The plot isn't bad , and moves this along nicely . The pacing is reasonable . The acting varies , but Oliver . . . can someone please explain to me why he never got more of a career ? I've yet to see him suck . McKean is both good and likable . The special effects , while some are outdated , are actually pretty good . The sci-fi elements do hold some interesting points , and are handled well , not too simplified . The sense of humor certainly has its moments . Direction can be great . Editing is usually positive , and it has some rather effective parts . Cinematography is fine . For a kid's movie , there is a bit of language . There is also some violence , and a handful of mature references . This does bear some marks of being for little ones , if not many . Music is OK . As has been pointed out , this is a solid choice for the whole family . I recommend this to young ' uns , their parents and their siblings . . . as long as they're all open to science fiction .
Decent , worth one semi-attentive viewing at best	I haven't been able to find the original Sam Peckinpah film of ' 72 , though it's not for lack of trying . I've been trying to see a Peckinpah film for quite some time , after hearing quite a lot about his directorial talent . When this film came on TV , after missing it about five showings so far , I decided to check it out . After all , it's got James Woods and Michael Madsen in the cast , both portraying criminals . . . that can't be all bad , right ? Not all bad , no , but certainly not very good , either . The film ranges somewhere between half-bad and almost good . It's somewhat good , but it loses momentum less than half-way through , and it's hard to watch attentively from that point on . Truth is , it just doesn't really have anything we haven't seen before . Couple of criminals get together to rob a place , some of them try to keep the loot for themselves . . . they all run . So what ? We never really get a reason why these particular criminals should be important , why we should care about them . The film ends up just being a decent heist movie with a good cast . The plot is nothing special or even slightly original . The pacing is bad , and even the most patient people will lose interest sooner or later . The acting is pretty good . The characters are somewhat well-written , but they aren't fleshed out properly , and are in the end just dull and uninteresting . The action is OK , but there are plenty of better action-flicks out there . Basically , this isn't really worthwhile , but I guess it's decent for a single , half-attentive viewing . Bonus for those who do muster up the effort to watch : both female attractive cast members , Kim Basinger and Jennifer Tilly get naked for some scenes . I recommend this to fans of any of the principal actors , possibly the genre and possibly the director .
How it all began	This is a special feature found on the 2-Disc set of X2 , released in 2003 . . . but . . . and this is where it gets confusing . . . it doesn't mention the second movie , and never clearly defines itself as being about neither the first film nor the comics , but really takes some of both . It comes off as mostly about the second , and does present a lot of information on that , so if I had to call it , that's where I'd put my money , what I'd put it on . This is made up entirely of interview bits and clips of the film , with many , many drawings and comics added in ( more subtly and effectively used than the clips ) . Some talk about what was changed from the comics to the movie , a bunch about the history , efforts to bring it over to another medium and a pretty reasonable amount of insight into the characters , with some really great things said . There are an anecdote or two , perhaps the best being the one involving a very long car ride . Overall , the ratio of who talks seems to favor the comic people , which is exactly as it should be . Lee is just awesome to listen to . It's got decent pacing and editing . All in all , this isn't bad , but it could be stronger , and it would have helped if it had found its voice . The cutting in of film clips and the like ( but not interviews or comics ) seems unimpressive at best . I recommend this to any fan of the movies and / or the comics .
A step in the right direction . . . though not exactly a huge one	After the first Army Men , which felt somewhat rushed , this came out , with new features and changes compensating for many of the shortcomings of the first . However , it did come out relatively soon after the first . . . and in some ways , this feels rushed , as well . Like so many other series where the first game was difficult to the point that the average gamer complained , this sequel was made considerably easier ( and less strategic , as well ) . There are still challenges , but the game now hints strongly towards the solution they want you to find ( instead of , you know , perhaps making the game more open , to let the player decide how he'll go about completing the set objectives ) . Yet again , what we have here is not strategy . . . it's an action game with tactical elements . The plot is fair , and there's certainly more of it than in the first ( not that that's saying much ) . It picks up right where the first left off , and takes you through both the Army Men world and our world . Having finished the game minutes before writing this , I can also say that it most certainly has a more satisfying ending . The sound is much better , and the voice acting is still good ( and now features a bigger range of emotion ) . The level design is quite good , and much more detailed and pleasing to the eye than the far-too-simple nature of the levels of the first game . Many things of the first are tweaked ; The game screen feels bigger , to allow for more action in view . In the first , you were often shot at before you could see the other soldiers ; that happens seldom , if ever , here . The strategic map ( which the game now actually suggests that you consult ) is much more detailed ( in the first , it seemed like a crude drawing , which , while it fit with the style , was dull to look at ) , and now offers several hints , as well as making your goal a tad clearer than it was in the first . The objectives are diverse and entertaining to achieve , if a few of them are of odd difficulty ( it goes back and forth between being easy and hard , some times ) . The graphics are improved a little , and everything is made lighter . . . the first game was so dark that it was almost hard on the eyes , while this time around , it's very naturalistic , which is definitely fitting . The soldiers still feel and act like plastic . . . if somewhat less so , since it now takes more fire to burn your average soldier than before . Most of your enemies are the same , though zombies ( ! ) are now added . I found this to be quite peculiar , for this sort of game , but I can't deny that their physical appearance is amusing and completely in line with the visual style and overall tone of the games . The AI is improved a bit , though it could still use a hand . . . soldiers still don't keep their flame-thrower from spraying hot , firey death upon their allies , ( computer-controlled ) vehicles get stuck and you will , more often than not , find bazooka-men firing into a wall that you stand behind , often until the point where they blow themselves up . The squad-system is improved , though there aren't really any new commands to issue your men . It's made simpler to use and more efficient , and you can now select members for your squad by dragging a square around them , similar to RTS games . The single-player also gives you more soldiers than the first game . Sarge can now also be controlled almost entirely with the mouse . You can control where he should go by clicking there , though the aforementioned AI will occasionally send him walking into a wall and other obstacles , so the keyboard is still preferable . The scrolling is made looser . . . too loose , for my tastes . The single-player portion is still relatively short . . . 12 actual levels , and most of which have between two or three missions ( there is now a save feature , but early on , I hardly used it as the missions tend to be quite short ) . The multi-player has been vastly improved upon ; six different modes ( all fun to play ) , and a total of ten maps ( all very well-done ) . You can also now buy things , prior to initiating play ( appropriately , with " plastic " , which you can also determine how much each separate player gets before the game ) , including soldiers with one of the main weapons , vehicles ( including the new boat , which is hardly in the single-player , though it is a blast to use ) , AA guns ( to prevent your enemies from using air support over your base ) and even bunkers with an armed man inside . The weapons are much more plentiful in the first ( and all the ones from the first are still there ) , and you can carry more at a time ( a feature that ties in with making it easier , and has is both good and bad ) . . . a total of six at a time , with the rifle being one of them ( which can now be upgraded to increasingly more powerful and fast , throughout the levels , instead of simply once ) . The new ones include aerosol , a magnifying glass and M80s , for the more cruel players ( who may very well have treated their own toy soldiers that way , as children ) , interesting ones such as a sniper rifle , and even useful items , including a wrench to fix vehicles and buildings and an enemy disguise . You can now also pick up more ammo from boxes of the same type of ammunition ( again , to make it easier , and which is both good and bad ) . The method of moving your cross-hairs are improved , though with a catch ; you aren't informed if your gun can fire as far as you're aiming , and Sarge won't move closer , but fire too short a distance if you shoot , making the programming of that feature less impressive than even the earliest of RTS games ( which started about half a decade before this was released ) . Overall , I prefer the first game , though I'll admit this is better . I recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the first and anyone intrigued by the concept .
Out there	The ninth and final Animatrix short , as well as the longest , running at about 16 minutes . This is the most surreal of them all , with downright psychedelic images . The animation is amazing , well-done 2D Animé with well-integrated and utterly stunning 3D CGI elements . One can tell that this was done by Peter Chung ( directed as well as written ) , the man who brought the world Aeon Flux ( the television series , not the movie ) . With a brief philosophical debate making up nearly all of the dialog in this , this also has food for thought , including some in the basic idea of it , in which there is great irony . The sound and visuals are impeccably well-done . I could imagine many not enjoying this on account of how weird it is ( not to say that anyone who doesn't care for this has that particular reason for it ) , it definitely is not for everyone . There is a making of on this , as with all the others ( albeit in a couple of cases , two share one ) , on the DVD , and it is an interesting watch at almost seven minutes . There are various disturbing things here , and it will be up to the individual viewer to decide what is and what isn't , really . I recommend this to fans of the Matrix universe , trippy , off-beat and imaginative efforts and / or science fiction .
Ironically , it doesn't go all the way	Coming in at about 13 minutes , this , the seventh of the Animatrix short is the longest of them all . The pacing is mostly good , and in spite of sometimes being laid-back , it's never boring . The animation is great , a nice mix of 2D Animé style and gorgeous 3D CGI elements . The many surreal visuals are beautifully realized . The writer and director behind this has a vivid imagination , however , this is not for everyone . It deals with the idea of glitches in the programming , and how they are perceived or treated by those who discover them . The themes explored aren't bad . The concept doesn't go as far as it arguably could , but I understand that the Wachowski's requested that it go no further than it does . The sounds and music are well-done . Voice acting has fine performances . The characters are credibly written and portrayed . This doesn't directly relate to the films , other than taking place in the same world as they do . It has a making of , on the DVD , which runs at about nine minutes , and is interesting and worth watching . I recommend this to fans of the Matrix universe and / or science fiction .
Cool , but packed with glaringly obvious plot holes	You can almost always rely on John Woo to deliver great action . . . Face / Off and those of his films that were made before he went Hollywood , especially those featuring Chow Yun-Fat ( or so I've heard ; have only seen Face / Off myself ) are great and popular for his unique brand of cool , stylish action . His use of slow-motion in action sequences are especially popular ; here , he delivers as well . . . but one can't help but think about whether or not Woo ( or anyone else , for that matter ) actually read the script . There are quite an impressive amount of glaringly obvious plot holes for such a short action flick . . . but I suppose what we're supposed to pay attention to is the car ( this is a commercial , after all ) and its capabilities . . . though I think many of them are exaggerated , at least slightly , in this . The acting isn't particularly good , but Clive Owen is still great as The Driver . . . not that one would expect anything else from him . The action is pretty cool , that I must admit . And it somehow manages to overshadow the numerous holes in the fairly thin plot . All in all , worth a single watch , for car freaks . But not much more . I recommend it to big fans of Woo and the commercials , as well as car fanatics .
Clearly not meant to be taken seriously , but still a fun ride delivered by Hitchcock	When a film is made while the country is involved in a World War , it's hard for it to come out entirely unbiased . . . though I suppose this film also reveals quite a lot about Hitchcock's own sensibilities . The whole film has a tone of democracy and ' united we stand ' , but it's fairly nicely buried in the interesting plot and the entertaining action . The film is obviously not meant to be taken seriously - with the exception of one very intense monologue by the lead - but it is thoroughly very entertaining . As soon as you accept that Alfred made this for fun , you'll love just about every second of it . The heroes are incredibly lucky at times , getting out of situations in the most unrealistic ways , by the most unlikely means . The high pace and energy of the film is kept through many sudden , unexpected occurrences . Just about every time you think everything is fine , that the lead is safe , something happens . In best Hitchcock fashion , several of the occurrences are very suspenseful . The plot is fairly well-written , and it evolves throughout the whole film , never standing still . The pacing is very good , something is constantly happening . The characters are well-written and credible . Many of them very likable , too . Particularly an elderly blind man encountered early in the film . The acting is top-notch . The dialog is quite well-written and equally well-delivered . All in all , a very entertaining and early Hitchcock piece , though the propaganda-like undertones of pro-democracy can be a bit of a pain to sit through . I recommend this to any fan of Hitchcock .
Handy	This is another still of the featurettes on the DVD of Team America : World Police , informing you on a subject of the creative process behind it . This one specifically deals with the control of the puppets , the amount of effort going into even one moving or emoting , various of the limitations as well as the scope of the whole thing . It consists of interviews , behind-the-scenes footage and clips of the movie itself . The speakers have interesting things to say , and Matt and Trey can be fun enough to listen to . There is a little language , and it's quite strong . This comes in at 10 minutes , making this the longest of the documentary extras found on the disc ( no , I'm serious ) , and it shows . A reasonable amount of time is spent in this , and it doesn't feel like it's in as much of a hurry to get done as some of the others . Thus , it has fairly fortunate pacing . It's edited well , and very good to watch if you want to know more . I recommend this to any fan of the film itself , and / or anyone who are curious as to how the heck they achieved the stuff .
Not just what is said a while before " cut "	This is one of the seven short featurettes about Team America : World Police , found on the DVD of that . Among other subjects , such as the lighting and cinematography , it goes into the hiring of Bill Pope , who probably gets the most screen-time in this , but as he's got tremendous stuff to share about the work done on the film , doesn't waste a moment with things that we don't care about ( credit for that is to be shared between him and the editor of this ) , and just plain seems really cool , that's not bad at all . He details certain problems he had on the production , as director of photography , on account of the miniatures and puppets . In addition to the interview bits , this is made up of behind-the-scenes footage , and several clips from the movie . It's paced quite well , never too slow or overly fast . It's cut reasonably tightly . It comes in at not much less than seven minutes , so it's neither the least nor the most long of the bunch on the disc . It's rather informational . I recommend this to anyone who wants to know more about TA , particularly this specific area .
Pretty exciting , but overall , a very standard thriller	This is a pretty standard thriller . Harrison Ford performs pretty well , in fact , most of the actors portray their characters very good . I really liked the typical in-your-face smart-ass character that Tommy Lee Jones ' played ; he was a great comic relief , coupled with Joe Pantoliano . I also enjoyed the inventiveness of Harrison Ford's character , throughout the movie . The plot is interesting , but I guess it's mostly there as an excuse for a mostly standard thriller . The characters are believable and all the actors portray their respective characters well , with no exception . The suspense is pretty good , and it lasts for most of the movie ; unfortunately , at the very end it seemed to degenerate into a typical thriller , and for this movie , it just seemed like it had the potential to be better than that . The movie is one of the better thrillers , but it's only worth watching if you like standard thrillers , and you're just looking for the pick of the bunch . I'd only recommend this to fans of standard thrillers , or fans of any of the main actors .
Thank you for not rushing , if nothing else , at least by comparison	This is the second of the seven short featurettes on the DVD of Team America : World Police , and details the creating of the world it takes place in . It slows down some from the first , and is almost three times as long ( more precisely put , 13 minutes ) , both of which are very welcome changes , and obviously they're directly connected to one another . As this was a puppet movie , not one with human actors physically appearing , everything had to be built , in scale . This goes into that , and reveals a couple of the rather creative ways they integrated real-life objects into sets and costumes . It also includes other people than Matt and Trey , and that's nice , because while they are fun to listen to , the crew also have great things to say . This consists of interviews , behind-the-scenes footage and concept art , intercut with clips from the flick itself . It's well-edited , and never ceases to be interesting . It moves at a fitting speed , never too fast or overly slow . I recommend this to any fans of TA , those who made it , and anyone who wants to know more about the piece , or , to a lesser degree , the folks behind it .
Uneven , but definitely worth watching	Ever since I first saw Gattaca , I've been looking for other films directed by Andrew Niccol . This being one of them , and so far , one of the only ones ( but I certainly hope he makes more films in the future . . . he has some very interesting ideas ) , I simply had to watch . I was not disappointed . Like Gattaca , this is science fiction ; however , Gattaca is more of a all-out sci-fi film , and S1m0ne only has some elements of science fiction . Before I comment on the sci-fi , I must comment on the great humor in the film . This is the first of Niccol's films ( Truman Show , Gattaca and then this ) I've seen that has comedy ( in the form of satire , that is ) . Truly great comedy , as well . You know why ? Because it's real . It's stuff that we can recognize , stuff that we know from ourselves , from the people around us . The comedy mostly revolves around how easily everyone is tricked , how quick they are to believe in something without any proof . I believe it was Voltaire who said : " If there were no God , it would be necessary to invent one " . We want to be deceived , we want to be tricked , we want to have something to hope for and believe in . I mean , let's be honest ; that is the very basis for why religion exists , and why people claim to spot UFOs . People need to believe in something . . . and they believe in Simone . Despite what her maker has her do , despite no one ever having met her in person , people love her . They need to . They need someone , something to believe in . The many scenes of Viktor covering up Simone not being real , creating the illusion of her in various forms to satisfy other people's urge to see her , meet her , talk to her may be somewhat slapstick in their nature , but they only emphasize how ludicrous and easily bought the everyday man is . They want to believe it so badly , they simply can't accept anything else . This seems to be what most critics of this film are missing . Their refusal to accept it is simply them denying human nature . As Pacino's character realizes near the end : " She's indestructible " . It is not possible to remove her , because the public won't accept it . She must exist . I noticed a lot of references to the story of Frankenstein in this film . It is basically the 21st century's version of Frankenstein , with some computer-based science fiction elements and set in Hollywood . I have never seen a film that so openly mocks the superficiality of Hollywood , and for that reason alone , anyone should see it . The plot is very good , though it develops at a somewhat uneven pace . . . in fact , the pacing seems a tad off . The acting is mostly very good . The special effects are top-notch . . . they were in 2002 , and they still are . This could have been better , but it was still very good . I recommend this to anyone who is interested from reading the plot outline , people who enjoyed Gattaca and fans of science fiction as commentary on real issues .
An interesting way of doing a sequel	I base this review on the Generation Set release . This is an expansion pack for Half-Life , and with the adventures of Gordon Freeman being completed for the time being , they decided to give you a different perspective on the events of the original . You play one of the soldiers , this time . This continues several traditions of the first , and also brings with it some things . It does a reasonable job of doing justice to the excellence , although it obviously does not add as much " fresh " as it did . It does provide more good play in the familiar universe of that , if less time . . . this time , it took me about ten hours , like Max Payne 1 and 2 . But hey , it's not a full game , plus , I knew where I was going , it may take longer when you don't . In a way pretty similar Yuri's Revenge put mind control all over the place , after it was in Red Alert 2 some , this takes the teleportation we've already seen and expands ( albeit nowhere near as aggressively as YR ) . There's a weapon that utilizes it , for example , and it's not half bad . This has all the ones the first did , and at least half a dozen new ones , including a machine-gun , a sniper rifle , a Desert Eagle with laser-sight and a couple of exotic instruments of bringing swift death to your opponents , such as a grenade launcher-like one , and one of those mouth-aliens that you're familiar with if you've tried one of these . That one can even be used for transportation , by you having it pull you towards specific areas ( and it is pretty gnarly to use against someone , if possibly disturbing to some ) . The arms remain faithful to those of what came before this in being tactical and awesome all at the same time . They do appear to be stronger . Your foes are also still smart , and team up to take you out . Now that your compadres are marines , you also get to engage in squad combat , and in that , too , the AI is quite fantastic and well-done , though the method of giving orders could arguably have used work , if it does get the job done , and seldom has actual problems . The commands are again limited to " stay here " and " come with me " , and if they're doing one , merely press the Use key to get them to do the other . Apart from regular troops , there are Medics . . . self-explanatory , they heal , you , and , if you can get them to do so , the other uniformed guys ( however , when you need them to , to progress , they will , as far as I have seen ) , and Engineers , who can blowtorch through certain locked doors . Neither of these are really used all that often , which in itself is not necessarily a big deal ( and in this case , it doesn't feel that tacked on ) . Worse is the case with the rope . It isn't used a ton , thankfully , because climbing and swinging them is simply tougher than it ought to be . They got the physics relatively right , and the implementation isn't awful ( if repetitive ) , and they definitely did not do as horribly with them as they could have , but still . You are taught about them in the Boot Camp , the training bit of this , which is harder than the Hazard Course , and , thus , arguably prepares you for the rest of the title better , which is a tad less easy . There are three difficulties , and they are the basis for the re-playability of this . This also gets going somewhat faster , and offers you the means to fight back sooner . The plot is fine , not as compelling as that of what preceded this , with fair progression and pace . The story-telling is as it was , with no actual cinematics , rather , you overhear conversations , dialog is spoken at you , and you witness occurrences . Through all of that , you have some freedom in choosing the angle , as the view never changes from First Person , with 360 degrees of turning it . This doesn't hold up to as close scrutiny . . . why does every guard and scientist you meet accept you as being on their side ? Did someone radio everyone , giving them a basic description of what you look like ? The boss battles are well-done and satisfying enough . This has nice references to HL . The humor doesn't take away from the rest of this . The multi-player is fun , nothing has really been altered . It does have 13 arenas . Team Deathmatch and Free For All are still the two modes it allows . This features creatures not seen before , well-done , and this means you have to adjust to them , rejuvenating the experience . There are a couple that are used so many times in what is not a very long time , spammed to the point of you getting tired of them , once or twice in this . The level design , as is something of a theme in this , are a step down , if not a huge one , from the one this follows . The puzzles are well-done . The take on Night Vision in this is decent , at the very least , in my opinion . The graphics are dated today , and if you want them improved , you can consider investing ( meanwhile , don't expect it to particularly go up in value , unless copies of it are or become collector's items or something ) in Blue Shift , as it holds a High Definition Pack , that upgrades the visuals on NPC's , or Non Player Characters , and your arsenal , alike . The audio is well-done , with voice acting above average in quality , well-composed score and sound effects all fitting . There are bugs in this , possibly less than the one before it , and , whilst it is an issue this time around , too , this may possess greater stability , as well . There is a little language , and the violence and gore are present , if by no means as extensive as other VGs . I recommend this to any fan of this franchise and series , and / or , while it is suggested that you start before this one , those who enjoy FPS's in general .
It's like me : witty and engaged	Is there a specific reason why Crystal has not directed more often ? I'm feeling like starting a petition and sending a copy of this to anyone who would potentially sign it . He , Mantegna , Kavner ( the three reasons I gave it the much-deserved chance ) , Winger and Stevenson are fantastic . Their performances and the timing , spot-on . This is incredibly funny , in the clever , dry , not trying too hard kind of way . The humor does have a few gross moments , however , apart from that , it's all hilarious , if you're into the sarcastic , at times cynical , type of material . Hardly any gags or jokes fall flat , throughout it . It's well-acted , and the characters are good . In addition , it's highly involving , and you find yourself caring , not just laughing , during this . Part of the emotion comes from the honesty of this , that it isn't your usual romantic comedy of " boy who looks like a male model meets female lead who appears to have stepped right off the train from Glamourville " , and so on and so forth . This has ups and downs , and goes beyond the superficial level of the Hollywood pap that we all know , without forgetting what genre of film it is . The story is imaginative and holds surprises . The writing is top-notch . Do note that this is not for kids , the rating the MPAA gave it makes sense . There is language and themes herein . I recommend this to any fan of anyone who was part of creating it , Billy in particular .
Unusually good , a solid addition to the genre , but not without flaws	The " stranger comes into main characters ' life , screws everything up and then tries to kill them " sub-genre of the thriller genre is ( or was , in the early 90's ) popular , and this addition to it might , at first glance , seem like it's every bit as shallow and predictable as the next one . However , it deserves a closer look , since on closer inspection , it displays a very accurate and credible psychological portrayal of the villain , some top-notch acting and some pretty good cinematography . The plot is fairly standard for the genre , as are the twists . No real surprises here . The pacing is quite good ; the film is never truly boring . The visuals are nice , but not really anything exceptional . The acting is quite impressive . . . everyone gives in a credible performance . The real force of this film , however , is the incredibly psychologically accurate behavior and presentation of the villain . Every action of hers , every train of thought was entirely psychologically accurate , as far as I could tell ( through my new-found love for and somewhat sparsely educated experience in psychology ) . The film has some very direct and revealing scenes of nudity and sex . They aren't exactly explicit ( we're not talking soft-core here ) , but they don't leave that much to the imagination , either . Definitely not for the faint of heart or the easily offended ( though I've never understood why someone could be offended by something as natural as nudity ) . Then there's of course the lesser parts of this film . . . notice how everything I've written up to this point has been either positive or neutral ? Well , that's about to change . The death scenes are more than unusually unrealistic , and they pretty much lose any shock effect because of this . The film is littered with the same usual clichés that plague the other films of the genre . In the end , the film doesn't really hold any surprises to fans of the sub-genre . The old saying is pretty much true , even in the case of this film . . . " If you've seen one , you've seen them all . " All in all , better than most of this type of film , but still far from perfect . I recommend it to fans of the genre , the actors or skin-flicks ( since there is a fair bit of skin in the film by the three leads ) .
Lucky he never met Woody Woodpecker	The adventures of the little tree-boy , and his , at least herein , rather . . . fond of girls , conscience , the bug . In typical Disney style , this moralizes ( and uses the " scare ' em straight " technique , which I'm presuming was popular at the time . . . maybe Walt was intending to give Santa some competition ) , as well as adding entries to the , even at that time , long list of " don't really try to do this , kids . . . no , honestly " . The plot isn't bad , and told fine . The character gallery is reasonable . The acting is somewhat mixed in quality . The sound is decent , same goes for music . Humor could use at least a little more variation . Some jokes and gags are good , and achieved nicely . This approaches 90 minutes , feature length . The DVD holds several special features . . . a game ( so simple and easy that it places itself dangerously close to the limit for how little it takes for something to be designated as such . . . though finishing it does beget a prize for fans of the Disney short cartoons ) , two " I'm No Fool " animated pieces , the original trailer and a making of . Animation is impressive for the time , and does have great details and the like . I recommend this to fans of Disney .
Good film , especially for what it is	This is a somewhat unusual film ; it's a children's film , but it doesn't talk down to its audience . And as an added bonus , it can be watched even if you are over ten . As the far too little-known short Bedhead , Robert Rodriguez has here created a film for children , featuring children . . . which doesn't treat them with the lack of respect for the smarts and sense of logic that they do already possess . Adults often forget what children are like , and think of them as ' less ' than the grownups . Rodriguez gives them ( and us ) a film that allows them a similar status to adults . The film has stuff that will appeal to kids ( spy equipment hidden in children's things ) but it isn't offensive to us who aren't . While it is more directed towards those of the preteen persuasion , it doesn't aim so low as to feel stupid for us who aren't of said persuasion . The plot is pretty good , though I guess it's not all that original . . . and as usual with children's films , the kids are the heroes , which puts too much pressure on them , as a Danish film critic so perfectly put it . The acting is a usual high ( as most of the actors are quite talented ) , no performances really let you down , even the ( intentionally ) overplayed ones . The characters , many of them fairly clichéd and thin , are all credible . As with many ( most ) Rodriguez films , pretty much all of those that he's written , himself . . . there are subplots and such , many of which are either overly easily resolved or not properly addressed . The humor is pretty good , I laughed out loud several points , rather unusual for children's films , and I was never insulted by the humor . None of it tries too hard to garner laughs , either . The special effects are quite impressive , and though it's still evident that it's Rodriguez ' mini studio , it will fool you for the very most part . The action is quite intense and exciting , and like the humor , it's got Rodriguez ' unique touch . Any fan of Rodriguez ( such as myself , which is by far the main reason I watched this very film in the first place ) will enjoy this , if maybe not to the same extent as one of his typical films . I recommend this to any fan of Rodriguez or any of the actors , and definitely most kids . Very much worth watching , even if you've outgrown childhood . Indulge your inner kid .
Doesn't suck	This is a very theoretic documentary , that aired on The History Channel . It deals with the possibility of a Black Hole in the Earth . We are explained what such is , as a space phenomena , and then they go into the interesting concept that is the basis of this program . It's a pretty big , forehead-slapping " oh , of course " moment when you find out what they mean by the idea . That is part of the reason I'm not putting it here . This features interviews with specialists within several fields , some actual , real-life footage from many different sources and times , as well as graphics and more . It ran at an hour total , so without commercials , it's 42 minutes , give or take a couple , from start to finish of the production . This may very well provide food for thought , for those who want to know about the subject . There isn't particularly anything offensive in this , in fact , unless the thoughts expressed bother the viewer , there is nothing that qualifies . I recommend this to anyone that wishes to find out all regarding this .
" But . . . I have references ! "	With no less than six movies about the two out at the time , and at least one very strong hint towards them meeting , there was plenty of material for this . They certainly also implemented about as much of it as they could . . . in places , this is a veritable cornucopia of such . Fortunately , they not merely slap this together with a little of this and that . . . while not as well-crafted as the second , this game is great . It can be frustrating , in part due to the difficulty ( and originally , you couldn't even save ) , which should also be noted isn't entirely even , either . . . each race does not have the same amount of trouble with their campaign , for example . There are glitches and the like , but not too many , and few that are major . One of its main detractor is really the lack of an overall story-line . It features all three species , and they're fairly well-rounded and equal . Some decisions made to make them so were not the best ones , however . . . the Predator can come off as something of a tank ( not . . . quite what he's perceived as on the screen ) , and the Marine ( poor guy must have such an inferiority complex , never mentioned in a title . . . ) not only has to pick up any gun but the main one ( including from one mission to the other ) to use it , but several of the ones firing bullets seem to " lock up " sometimes ( in both cases , presumably to keep them from becoming too powerful , maybe in particular due to the Alien , with his complete lack of ranged attack ; this was improved upon in the sequel ) . Nevertheless , each is fun to play as , and will usually do a pretty darn reasonable job of emulating the experience of the films . The video-game isn't all that long . . . the initial task of figuring out where you have to go ( this production , if anything , will test your spatial skills , as well as memory ) and what to do to complete a given objective or level makes it last more , and a number of unlock-ables will have you going back and replaying . Each of the three will meet the other two , at more than one point in the course of playing . This is perhaps more challenging than atmospheric . . . not that much build-up is herein . On the other hand , it is intense . . . if this doesn't leave your nerves in shreds , they must be laced with adamantium . There is something of a randomizer within this . . . whether that's positive or not is really up to the individual players ; but from one attempt to the other , the number , weaponry and placement of enemies ( and for the last option , also items needed to progress further ) may vary , if not every time , and not always that much . The sound isn't bad at all . I haven't said the last about the similarities to the silver screen stories . . . more or less ( but not completely ) every piece of the respective arsenals are here , with multiple additions , as well . If you enjoyed Aliens and / or either of the Predator flicks , especially the action ( or , really , the horror , too , this actually works marvelously well as both , the genres are achieved well , here ) , this is good ( not to say fantastic ) news . A lot of the equipment and abilities are also there ( and done nicely much of the time ) . Vision Modes , the Motion Tracker , Wall-Running and more . I'm afraid I can't claim that they had perfected the last-mentioned at this point . . . far too often , they seem to stick to stuff ( painfully vulnerable , rather literally ) , and not even only when controlled by a player , which somewhat ruins the illusion and otherwise fine mood of this . At points , the goals and objectives could be more interesting , and stronger defined , but they had to work with two creatures whose goals and values are not made clear . Each side gets one intro / outro-cutscene ( each ) , relatively well-done . You sadly sometimes have to engage in silly routines to make up for the shortcomings . Still , this is worth playing , even after its follow-up . The playing styles differ between the three , possibly best compared to RTS titles with three sides . AI is wildly mixed . . . and I can't help but feel that it's awful considerably and noticeably more than all that much towards the other end of the spectrum . One thing that simply has got to get described is Skirmish , or the multi-player's Co-op mode ; it puts the other two other against an endless stream of Xenomorphs , all controlled by the AI ( and the others all humans ) . This can be a recreation reaching absolutely indescribable heights , and can frequently last for extensive lengths of time , and sometimes ages remarkably well . The humor of this ( whether or not it's misplaced is another subjective matter ) lies almost exclusively in the bonus elements ( the earlier mentioned extras that can be gained in this piece of electronic entertainment ) . There are bonus levels , earned through finishing the main portion ( for each of the three , its missions earned when that . . . yeah , you get the drift . . . I hope . . . ? ) , more of the set total available through the higher the setting you accomplish it on . . . and these aren't original ones , but more re-used , sometimes backwards , from the other two's collection of such ( and let's just say that . . . some get more mobility than they had earlier , in them ) . And then there are Cheat Options . These seem to largely , or even altogether , perchance , be things that the creators just found by fiddling around with code and the like , and then put them in this way . They are . . . well , some are weird , more than one make things easier ( mind you , you cannot use them first time ) , and they are more often than not . . . well , different , if not always anything else at all . Make sure to see the Target , when the statistics are displayed , if you want these . . . that's what you're aiming for , what will let you acquire them . Multi-player is sufficient ( including the modes ) , and stable and well-supported . If you want an authentic experience within the fictitious universes , this can be terrific . I recommend this to any fan of either or both franchises , and / or any of the three characters .
Solid	First off , I watched this on television , so it is possible that it was , at least somewhat , censored . I really don't think I've seen a single film of John's that I didn't care for . . . I don't love each and every one , but I like them all . The man can build atmosphere so skillfully , it isn't even funny . This is no exception to that rule ; from the very beginning to the very end , starting with the very first shot and object that we are shown ( meanwhile , that entire scene fits so well into the rest , that its background , written in the Trivia section ( for you to either read or avoid to do so ) is unexpected ) . The plot is great , and well-told . This is interesting and engaging throughout . The acting isn't bad for any of the performers ( well , maybe the kid , but . . . it's a kid ) . This is genuinely scary . The effects are well-done , not sure there really are any herein that fail to live up to that . I knew I had to view this when I heard that Rob Bottin ( who went on to help make The Thing ( one of my favorites , along with Halloween ) the amazing piece that it is ) had two separate jobs in this . I was not disappointed . Carpenter yet again gets a lot out of not that much money . There are films with considerably larger budgets that won't offer anything resembling the mood that seeps through the screen from every frame of this , or the shocks . He also makes this work remarkably well . . . I normally don't go for this type of horror . The story is rather good . I recommend this to fans of this kind of movie and / or John Carpenter and what we're used to him delivering .
Very good suspense and atmosphere	My fiancée and I watched this , not knowing exactly what to expect of it . . . we agreed that it looked interesting . We watched it on TV , so some things may have been cut . First off , the movie looks very good . Visually , there are few things to complain about ( though it does get overly and unnecessarily stylized at one or two points ) . Editing is mostly tight , cinematography very nice , if flashy in a handful of parts . The only thing worth bringing attention to as negative was the use of slow-motion . . . that did just not work well . What does work well , however , is the build-up and the atmosphere . The movie was creepy throughout . . . not one jump-scare to be found , only genuine suspense . The lighting and tone was dark . . . as in " not brightly lit " , not so much as in actual dark subject matter ( although the people on the plane seem rather overly cruel and cynical at times , towards the situation at hand ) . The acting is good , no one really either shines or stands out as awful . Erika Christensen could have been used more . Sarsgaard's performance emulates the work of John Malkovich , but , with neither me nor my fiancée having seen him in anything else , we can't say if that's just his way ( although his bio seems to indicate that this is the case ) . The score was very subtle , and there wasn't a lot of it , either . . . this helped establish and maintain the mood . Pacing was fairly good . The movie didn't drag us in as much as it could have , but it made for an entertaining couple of hours . It was exciting when it meant to be , and it was unsettling and kept the suspense going for as long as it needed to ( and wanted to ) . The twist came as a surprise to the both of us , and a positive one at that . The very end , however , was a tad too Hollywood . Until that point , it had been in the vein of Hitchcock ( the master of suspense did better work , but this did have good suspense ) , but the end was admittedly a letdown . However , this remains a reasonably good and thoroughly watchable suspense mystery thriller . I recommend this to fans of the actors and of suspense movies . . . if you aren't planning on taking a flight anytime soon ( and people with recent deaths in the family may also want to steer clear , pun intended ) .
A cute take on the legend	Along with Vincent , this short is featured on the DVD of The Nightmare Before Christmas . Since I first read about it here on IMDb , I've wanted to watch it . It's a delightful little film version of Frankenstein , seen from a child's perspective , and with charm and a sweet sense of humor . You'd be hard pressed to find a film that , whilst remaining somewhat dark , still manages to appeal to the kid in all of us so well . Most anyone can enjoy this . The fact that Burton was fired from Disney for making this kind of film is quite sad . This short displays beyond any doubt that Tim could easily have handled great children's films . The plot is well-written and moves along nicely . The scene of Sparky's demise is almost painful to watch , as it is so easy to see where it's going , how it'll end . But Burton holds us there , keeps us in a position where we can only watch , anticipating what will happen but do nothing . The way the story develops and ends works very well . I shouldn't write it out in detail , as it is far too great to spoil . The acting is solid , with few , if any , performances lacking . The characters are credible , if slightly grotesque at times ( a trait Burton brings to most of his projects , be they about the living or otherwise ) . The writing is very good all-round . The humor is neither cruel nor juvenile . . . just about everyone can laugh at it . It is at times somewhat dark , though . Not much left to say . . . I enjoyed this simply shot , fun little movie , a sign of great things to come for Tim Burton . I recommend this to any fans of him and anyone looking to watch alternate re-tellings of the great novel .
I have to admit , it won me over	I don't particularly care for Chase . I simply usually don't really find him funny . But I did like this . I have not read any of the books . It happened somewhat gradually , but long before this was over , I was enjoying myself . In the long run , the thing's just difficult to resist . Some of the comedy is from sexual matters , but it's never explicit . There is also a little bit of gross-out material . Most of the jokes and gags are based on Fletch's way of handling situations , and his personality as well as in general how he relates to his surroundings . Chevy ( the man , I . . . wouldn't know about the car ) carries it rather well , and I found myself quite interested in the whole thing . The plot is good , and keeps developing nicely throughout . Pacing is great , it never gets boring . The music is another quality area . The script is , as well , I wouldn't claim any of this to be predictable , at least not enough to bother . Funny , charming , not at all without tension and may very well keep you guessing until the end . I recommend this to fans of Chevy Chase and possibly ( inquire elsewhere would be my suggestion ) the title character .
Original and thoroughly entertaining 80's action movie	I re-watched this film , after having seen it about five or seven years ago , since I had a faint memory of it being somewhat entertaining . I had completely forgot how entertaining it was ; normally , I'm not into 80's movies , especially 80's action movies , but this one had some very unique qualities ; the most important being that most of the action scenes are done by the main character using special effects to trick and defeat the opposition , which makes for some incredibly entertaining scenes . The plot is very good , it's somewhat carried by the twists , but it's very good anyway . Besides , the twists are unexpected , intelligent , and entirely believable ( unlike many newer " plot twist " movies ' twists ) . The acting is fairly good , I personally thought that both Bryan Brown and Brian Dennehy gave good performances . Granted , most of the rest of the cast aren't exactly spectacular , but they're decent enough , I think . The characters are well-written , despite the fact that many of them are 80's action film clichés . The action is great , every scene seems unique and exciting , greatly aided by the unique nature of most of them . As a theme and basic idea , it's excellent . As a film , it's actually pretty good too . I recommend it to any fan of 80's action films , and just about anyone looking for a " different " 80's action film .
A film evolves and finds itself	After what can be argued to be an overlong and overdone opening , this special begins , letting the interviewees talk about how big the film was , in so many ways . . . the risk of it failing , the cost , the level of detail in it , the marketing , the merchandising ( notice what Nicholson is wearing ) , the media hype ( complete with footage from the time covering the level of it , and many , many posters and promotional images ) and more . It is mentioned that not everyone believed Burton could accomplish it , and Roger Pratt , the director of photography , reveals that he , too , had those who did not have faith in him , albeit they were subtle about it . Sam Hamm reveals that he was not responsible for two of the unpopular decisions made , script-wise . . . in fact , he had talked Tim out of one of them ( not to be revealed here , for those who have not watched the film ) . Danny Elfman talked about how difficult and pressured it was for him to work on it . The film's growth and evolution is talked about , offering insight into the creative process . There is a little footage of Burton going over the editing with whom I presume is the editor . Prince's music is mentioned fairly briefly . Possibly the best moment in this is Kane's widow describing his reaction to the turnout . This is a well-paced and all-round well-done special feature , and worth watching for those interested in the film . I recommend this to fans of the film , the character , and the creative process .
Cute	A companion piece , but not sequel to , The World of the End . Done by Adam , again , and his writing still manages to be clever and smart , and this , like aforementioned piece , has a situation that many will be able to relate to . Siegel plays the title character , yet again , and does not disappoint this time around , either . Bertocci as the computer has some good lines , and does a spoof of the well-known help feature of certain computer programs , and a well-done one at that . The visuals are fine , with sparse animation and movement , and I doubt they were intended to wow the viewer . . . as with his other work , as a general rule , the gold is in the script , the dialog . Coming in at less than three minutes , this has a rather inordinate amount of laughs and chuckles , with all the verbal comedy and such . The music is nicely done , and fits well throughout . This couldn't have been much more concise whilst retaining development and gain the viewer's involvement . I recommend this to fans of Adam Bertocci and the various shorts he's responsible for . Keep it up , Mr . B .
I'm not sure . . .	Coming back from the cinema after seeing this film , I'm not quite sure what to make of it . I guess it was on the way back , through the dark , empty streets , that I realized something was missing . Something important , maybe even crucial , something that needs to be there after just seeing a horror film on the silver screen . I wasn't scared . I wasn't looking over my shoulder , I wasn't listening for any strange sounds , I wasn't even looking twice on any person I walked past on the way . I'm a sucker for scary movies , I'll tell you that right away ; but this didn't scare me . It startled me , made me jump in my seat , but that's it . That's what the ' horror ' portion of the film is , a long series of jumps . There's nothing wrong with that . . . but that's just all it is . No real gore , no atmosphere , no psychological terror . . . just jumps . I'm not saying that any of the aforementioned qualities would make a better horror movie . . . but they probably would make it more ' full ' . The truth is , sadly , there's nothing in this movie that will really stay in your mind for very long after you leave the cinema . . . if there's still anything after the end credits . Luckily , the director rarely resorts to the cheap jump scares . . . few of the shocks come from a cat jumping down from a shelf or a friend appearing behind the main character , reaching out and grabbing their shoulder . Most of the time , when you jump , it's because someone just died or something genuinely disturbing just happened . The worst thing about the jump scares is probably that you can only watch and still . . . well . . . jump , because after that , you'll know where and when the jumps will occur . What makes this watchable apart from the undeniable effect of the jump scares is that , on some level , it manages to appear deeper than it is , without being condescending . There are plenty of little details , stuff that only the most watchful eye will notice . The way the story is told is masterful in a way . . . very little dialog is used to explain it . A series of situations and powerful acting tell us far more than Hollywood-like dialog ( which the film has slim to none of ) could . The plot isn't deep , and it isn't really the driving force in the film , but there's enough of it and it's mostly good . The acting ranges , but most of it's pretty good . The characters are well-written and interesting , but most of them just aren't developed enough for us to care about whether they live or die , which is a fatal mistake on the directors part , because it kills a lot of the suspense . The non-linear time-line is presented so casually that many viewers will probably be thrown off ( I know I was ) , and not know when exactly something is happening . One final note before I pass verdict ; personally I thought it was a mistake to cast Joxer of Xena : Warrior Princess ( Ted Raimi ) in a serious horror film , but at least his role isn't very big . Also , he is the executive producer's brother , and , well , that's pretty much Hollywood in a nutshell . All in all , the film is pretty much worth watching , but probably only once , and with reasonable expectations . I recommend it to fans of the Japanese horror films , keeping in mind that this is an Americanized version ( but done by the same director ) . However , even though I haven't seen them myself , you should probably see the original Ju-on film ( s ) . Also , personally I don't think this is as good an American remake of a Japanese horror film as The Ring . Go see that first , as well .
Not the second season , but not bad	After the disappointment of the third season , I was hoping for some improvement . . . that's what I got , no doubt about it , but the question is ' how much ' . Bringing back McInnerny and Fry was definitely a good idea , both are great additions to the cast , and both play different characters than before so it doesn't feel too reminiscent . . . any new show should offer new things . Keeping Laurie , and with him , the boisterous , loud-mouthed , slang-ridden personality that he brings . . . I'm not sure that was that great of an idea . I have no problem with the man , but the type of character he plays here and in the third season , I don't really care much for . He just doesn't really add anything worthwhile . Something that surprised me was how many gross-out , low-brow jokes they threw in this time around . . . I mean , sure , a few of the Baldrick ' lower than low ' jokes were like that in the two previous seasons , but this is preposterous . Why put something like that into the mix ? It only detracts from the verbal comedy and satire . Something , however , that was a positive thing , was that they ( almost , with maybe one or two exceptions ) completely avoided the see-through plots this time around . There were times were I was certain that I could tell what would happen , and the show would take me by surprise . " Bob " returns , though , unfortunately , with him ( or rather , her ) , Flasheart . Why is that character so popular ? I , personally , could do without him completely . Miranda Richardson returns yet again . . . rather good , as usual . While Blackadder was bitter this time around , he wasn't depressingly so , as in the third season . He was biting and satirical , as in the second season as well as the two specials , which is definitely the best type for the character . . . it should , however , be noted , that he is still more bitter than he were in those efforts . The plots are interesting and well-written . The episodes are mostly good ; apart from the last one , none of them really disappointed me , and even that one was rather good . The acting is all good . The humor has perfect timing and all of the top ( as they all are ) players are right on their marks . Almost all of this is clever , witty and biting , though there is some silly humor left over from last season ( by , for example , Laurie ) . Still , a must-see for any BlackAdder fan . I recommend it to any fan of Atkinson , any of the other comedians and / or British humor , as well as obviously anyone even remotely amused by the other BlackAdder installations .
Not every addition works , or is a good one	This is an add-on for Star Wars : Jedi Knight , and I've read that it was released a mere four months after the game . That's . . . not very long , and it sadly shows . Little of the game doesn't come across as rushed . Where the levels were complex , but nicely done , throughout both single player and multi-player of the original game , the level design here comes off as confused , and confusing , for the most part . On the plus side , there are far more levels for multi-player ( though some of them work for more than one mode of playing , making it appear like there are more than there are ) , and a few of them are recreations of well-known scenes ( and ones enjoyed by many , many viewers ) from the original three Star Wars films , and , well . . . they just plain rock . Think the endings of last two movies . There are fewer bosses , and they have much less of an impact . Force Powers are essentially the same , Pull is tweaked some , and there are four or five new ones ( Chain Lightning could be called basically the same as Lightning , though it can now " chain " between enemies . . . apparently . . . as far as I understand , it isn't particularly efficient ) . The new ones are Push ( which really isn't that helpful , in my experience ) , Projection ( which , while it sounds cool . . . creating an illusion of you , to draw enemy fire . . . really doesn't work , game-play wise ) , Lightsaber Throw ( which wasn't quite perfected at this point , but it does work . . . personally , I'm not a fan , OK , one character did it , in one movie , once ( I won't reveal who or when , in case anyone who hasn't watched all of the original trilogy is reading this review ) , but that's it ) and Far Sight ( which is a potentially interesting idea , but it just isn't that good . . . it allows you to fly around , outside of your character's body , and you can , well , look around , without moving ) . What may be the biggest issue connected to the Force Power is that this removes the distinction between the Dark and Light sides . . . and as if that , in itself , wasn't bad enough , a major point of the first , the choosing of a side , through how you play ( evil or good ) , goes straight with it ( obviously ) . Apart from the Force Powers , there's also something called Defence , which you can choose instead of Force Powers ( well , each star you assign to that will take away from which Force Powers you can choose ) , and which will ( help ) protect you against Force Powers . Defence is only available in multi-player . The multi-player adds something new . . . class-based characters . You can choose between the original's system , regular , and this new class-based one . The classes get certain , determined Force Powers and / or Defense settings , as well as starting weapons . The playing modes are Kill the Fool with the Ysalimiri ( which awards points to whoever is holding the Ysalimiri , and Force Powers can't be used against or by the person who is ) , Sith Multiplayer Duel ( allow me to translate : Deathmatch ) and Sith Lightsaber Training ( made for fighting with Lightsabers , and this one isn't compatible with any other character classes than Jedi ) . Capture the Flag is gone . The single player portion in no way reaches the same level of quality as the original . . . there is hardly any overall story , or if there is , it doesn't really start until just before the end of the game . " Companion missions " fits , perhaps too well . The levels are seldom connected any more than it being the same character you play as . . . except for that you play as Kyle for the first small portion of the game , for reasons I do not know ( what fun is there in starting over in building up weapons , and , much more so , Force Powers , just when you've gotten started ? This just serves to make the first part after you start as the new character feel even more anti-climactic , after completing the original ) . You play as Mara Jade for the majority of the game . . . I gather that she is connected to a well-known character in the Star Wars universe ( I won't reveal who , or in what way , partially because it could be considered a spoiler , and partially because I've heard conflicting reports ( make up your minds , people ! ) ) , and that she appears in the expanded universe ( right . . . ? ) , but she , as a character , has so close to literally nothing to do here , so I'm not sure if there was any purpose for choosing her , other than putting in a familiar face ( " look at who we got ! " ) . The main game , well , honestly , it just isn't anywhere near as fun as the original , in fact , at points , it's barely any fun at all . What main plot there is ( about the only thing having to do with Katarn ( who is the only thing connecting this to the series , apart from one other character , who wasn't too bad an addition , though he / she's almost nothing more than a reference to where else she appears ) , is of terribly little interest , and explores nothing new . The acting is thoroughly unimpressive , and while the original may not have featured stellar acting , it certainly surpassed this , by far ( and I'm talking about all of the acting . . . including in-game voices of characters ) , though I guess the absolutely awful acting is rare . By acting , I do , unfortunately , mean voice acting , only , as there is no live-action footage in this , nada . The masterfully done cut-scenes of the original are replaced by in-game ones , which again is a let-down . The sound is , literally , not of as high quality , the high-resolution sounds are gone . The add-on , all in all , is honestly just underdeveloped ( which is not to say that there is nothing good to be found ) . Some minor glitches . There are various minor changes . . . enemies may now go at you with their fists if you Pull their weapon , for a quick example . Some are good , some not . Really , this would seem much better if it didn't directly follow such a great game . This does have some to offer , and if you can get a good deal on both the original and this . . . go for it . I recommend this to fans of the first .
A good movie that could have been great , had it just picked a genre and sticked to it	When I sat down to watch this movie , I knew it was gonna be a thriller . Unfortunately , the film itself didn't seem to know this , and kept jumping between genres . I don't know who is to blame , the director , the scriptwriter , or someone else , but someone obviously didn't realize the importance of picking one ( or two , if you can't pick just one ) genre and sticked to that . Instead , what we have is a movie that is primarily a thriller , but has parts of action , horror , and a few sub-genres . . . there was even a scene of martial arts action ; who in their right mind puts martial arts in a thriller ? Apart from the problem of not settling on one genre , the film is pretty good . The mystery was quite good , though I'm not sure I entirely understood it . The thriller portions of the film were well-done , and the film has good atmosphere at a few points . The film has some creepy , disturbing and downright nasty scenes involving corpses and body parts . The cinematography was pretty good , but nothing too memorable . One mistake the filmmakers made was making just about every member of the French police force seem like a retard ; obviously done for comic relief , but done wrong and pushed too far . In the end , it's pathetic , and actually annoying to watch , rather than entertaining . If they wanted comic relief , they should have implemented it through dialog . Fortunately , though , there aren't too many scenes of these failed attempts at comedy , so it's easily forgiven . The humor that there was , the parts of it that work , were more often than not good , and I liked the relationship between the two main characters , which made for much better , and more entertaining , comic relief . The last problem the film has , is what I like to call the " Hollywood Syndrome " ; the last half hour or so being painfully predictable , and the very end being so awfully " happy ending " - like that it almost takes the enjoyment out of the pretty good film you've just watched . However , all in all , if you can ignore the shortcomings of the film , it actually makes for a good watch , if you can take the violence and you like a good mystery . A final note ; as the film is French , not English ( or American , for that matter ) the dialog is all in French . My French being crappy , pardon my French ( sorry , bad pun ) , I saw this with subtitles ( not that I had much choice , as I saw it on TV , but anyway ) , so if you don't understand French , you might wanna make sure that the version you're seeing is subtitled ( I've heard that there is an English-dubbed version , and that it's awful ) , in order for you to actually follow what's going on in the film . OK , one final note ( yeah , I lied before . Sue me ) ; while watching this , I realized that Jean Reno actually sounds cooler when speaking French than when speaking English . I recommend this to anyone who can stand the violence ( which is somewhat considerable and at times sadistic and gruesome ) , and who enjoys a good thriller-mystery . An all-round good mystery-thriller , with good acting and good production values .
By the book , but could be worse	I wouldn't say that I particularly enjoyed this , but I'm not going to claim that it isn't a fair piece of work . If you're into adventure , you may very well like this ( I'm not , hence . . . yeah ) . The plot is OK , pretty standard , formula stuff , and at times , it's predictable . The pacing is adequate . The acting is corny and over the top , intentionally or otherwise . I've seen even Wyle be more convincing elsewhere ( and I've only seen him in two other roles , from Enough and Donnie Darko ) . Hu isn't bad , but she barely has anything to do for almost ( but not entirely ) all of it . Newhart does get to do his thing a little bit , once or twice in this . The effects are quite the mixed bag . . . for being television , they are basically consistently good , considering , but you don't have to be looking to figure out how they did it , or what's CGI and what isn't ( in fact , to not , you might have to actually close your eyes ) . There is some action , and it's reasonable . The editing and cinematography are sufficient . This tends to be unconvincing . The references to other titles may induce cringing . I honestly wouldn't worry about the violence or imagery in this , the entire ordeal takes place in the world of no blood ( apart from S . W . A . T . , I'm not sure I've actually ever watched a film so obviously avoiding such ) . This couldn't be more obviously made-for-TV if every other line of dialog mentioned it . I recommend this to fans of the genre , and fabled artifacts and whatnot .
Tends to entertain	I'll start by saying that I honestly have not read any of the source material about at least half of who appears in this . I cannot comment on how those were done . I haven't watched the leaked version . This is a mixed bag , and it definitely could have been better . The very beginning is unclear and muddled , and ( what describes much else in this ) a disappointing waste of potential . I'll go over the positive first . Jackman basically is Wolverine . Schreiber does the attitude and sadism of Creed well , and he did bulk up for this . Reynolds is spot-on , when he's there . This is more raw than the X-Men films , and the tone is darker , whilst following the realism-based approach of them . The term " badass " fits well . The action is almost invariably awesome , enjoyable and exciting . The fights are well-done . The bone claws , as far as I know and could tell , were done right . The CGI is marvelous . This doesn't overstay its welcome . It ties into the other reasonably well . Now . . . this manages to have the same problem as the trilogy it's sort of a spin-off of . They try to fit in too many characters and powered people , and most get little to no personality , screen time or stuff to do . However , unlike that series , here , they aren't written around as much , you'll know what they do instead , if you have seen it , and you shouldn't if you haven't . Abilities are shoehorned in some , and the script , at times , feels like it was put together around the showdowns and such that they wanted in there , trying to include every mutant that they wanted , or that they felt the audience would wish to see in there . The nods at the comics range somewhat . The pace is uneven , rushing at points . The drama is actually effective , at its best , and captures some of the core of the anti-hero . It's sad that there are typical clichés and that , at the worst times , this feels like a lame revenge flick . It does hold nice twists , and there are excellent moments in this . . . what they do with the " procedure " in this is nice and well-done . It's all shot well , cinematography and editing are great . The acting is . . . not all quite good . Several depictions leave something to be desired . There is violence and disturbing content in this , if bloodless . There is infrequent , moderately strong language . I recommend this to fans of the graphic novels , the movie franchise and those who helped make this .
A typical Jackie Chan movie	This is the typical Jackie Chan action kung-fu buddy comedy , pretty much . There are no big changes to the typical formula , but people who've enjoyed the earlier films in the genre , by Jackie Chan . The plot is nothing totally special , though it does build on something that actually happened during the time this is supposed to take place . The acting is pretty much what you'd expect from this type of movie and these actors ; nothing great , but nothing really bad either . The characters are mostly just different types of comic relief or dramatic effect , none of them very believable , but once again , it's pretty much what you'd expect from this type of movie . The humor is the usual for Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson , nothing more , nothing less . The film isn't specifically interesting or attention-grabbing , but it's fun and thoroughly entertaining , so if that's what you're looking for in a film , then this is an ok choice . Not the best , but there are a lot of worse films . I'd recommend this to any fans of Jackie's previous films , or of Owen Wilson's humor . It's entertaining , if you're into this type of film .
A romantic comedy that a guy can see too	This is pretty much the typical romantic comedy , but with an interesting twist ; the main character has the ability to hear womens thoughts . The important thing was that for it to work , the character would be placed in a lot of interesting comical situations , where you could laugh at it , without it being too mocking of womens thoughts , or too far-out to enjoy . It succeeds pretty well , however the way the character gains and loses the ability were handled somewhat poorly . The humor is good , and there is plenty of it , throughout the entire runtime . The characters were believable , and the main character eventually grew to be likable . The plot was good , and the acting likewise . The only thing that brings the movie down , is the poor execution of the gain / loss of the ability to hear womens thoughts , and the sugar-sweet ending , that was too predictable and plain boring , as anyone who's seen one of the hundreds ( possibly thousands ) of romantic comedies out there . No actual new stuff brought to the table , apart from the interesting and original concept of a man being able to hear what women are thinking . OK for a romantic comedy .
A hit-and-miss parody . . . one of mostly hits	This movie is a compilation of short skits . . . mostly representing what one might find on American late-night television ( at least a few decades ago ) . Having not grown up neither in the right decade nor country , there may be a few jokes that I didn't get . The sketches vary in length , and some are more social commentary and satire than spoofs on commercials and 50's sci-fi / horror . Some of the comedy is pretty dark , but all of it is silly . There is some slapstick , but the majority of it seems to be parodying of commercials , shows and movies . From what I can tell , they hit the mark on most of the stuff pretty good . The R-rating seems like it could have been very , very easily avoided , so I would guess that the directors went for that because there wasn't really anything stopping them . For the benefit of both those seeking it and those trying to avoid it ; there is some nudity in this ( not an awful lot , but it seemed to last for a long time when it was there ) , and some swearing ( little of it , but it's relatively strong when it's there ) . The humor varies . . . most of the material works , though there's the occasional dud . Some gags go on for too long , and there was at least one joke that I saw coming about a minute before it was made . The " guest stars " were pretty good , those of them I knew . One needs only to check the cast list to see that they got some good names on this production . Hartman , I'm sorry to say , is severely underused . The pacing was fair , for a 80 minute long series of comedy sketches . Technically well-produced ( except for when it's not supposed to be ) . All in all , fine parody . I recommend it to fans of the type of movies spoofed ( space / sci-fi horror of the 50's ) and fans of spoofs .
Wouldn't have been anything if it wasn't for Jim Carrey's amazing talent ( s ) . . .	I have to say , this movie really would have been bad if it Jim Carrey hadn't been in it . Every single scene without him is hardly funny ; Jeff Daniels if miles away from Jim talent-wise . Jim can make you laugh with a simple movement of his face , whereas Jeff hardly could make me laugh at all . The script does put the two in some pretty funny situations , but hadn't it been for Carrey , the movie would have been very bad . I especially thought the dream / fantasy sequences with Carrey very unbelievably funny ; they really let him display his full talents , making extremely funny facial expressions and hilarious noises . This movie holds a few of the greatest moments with Carrey that's on film ( in my not particularly humble opinion , at least ) , but apart from those few truly great scenes , the movie isn't all that funny ; as mentioned earlier , especially the scenes with Daniels were usually barely funny at all . I would recommend any fan of Carrey to watch this , at least to watch the few very memorable , incredibly funny scenes in which he shows his potential . It has a lot of crude humor though , and a lot of it is downright disgusting , especially if you're not used to that sort of humor , but apart from that , it's just barely worth watching for any fan of Jim Carrey .
Good , but not great	I know that this is based on a Stephen King novel , but I haven't read it , so I can't really compare the film to it . I have watched a few movies based on novels by Stephen King ; IT , Carrie , The Green Mile , Children of the Corn , The Shining , Golden Years , Quicksilver Highway , Cujo , Christine , and , obviously , this one . Most of them I didn't like , I don't know if that has to do with King's novels , or if the directors screwed the films up , but anyway ; Of all of those , this one ranks up there as one of the best ( The Green Mile is the best ) . The plot takes off almost immediately , and then goes slowly for the rest of the movie . I was a little surprised at the slow rate , but , fortunately , at times the plot takes off again and provides some thrills for a short while , but it only last shortly , and once again it gets slow . The acting is all pretty good , there weren't really any of the actors who did a bad job . The film has a magnificent sense of humor , too , and there are a lot of funny moments all through it . The twist is pretty good , there are a few hints at it throughout the film , but I was definitely surprised when it happened . The films climax is also pretty good , though the very end is a little drawn out . All in all , a pretty good thriller , that could have been better . I recommend this to fans of thrillers .
Haunting imagery	Tim's got an undeniable knack for visuals . . . they'll usually be Gothic , mostly breath-taking , and always excellent . He also has a bit of a twisted side to his humor . Furthermore , he is talented in bringing colorful and well-designed creatures and characters , often of his own creation , to life . And lastly , he does atmosphere so extremely well , it's really just about beyond reproach . All of those are evident here . He takes an old legend ( which , I should point out , I have not read , all I know of it is what was in this , and that dull made-for-TV movie that I've also reviewed , from the same year and of the same title , save for adding " The Legend of " to the beginning ) and puts together a contemporary piece of immense enjoyment even for those not necessarily into such ( I should know , I am one ) . The plot is interesting throughout , and develops nicely . It's not too predictable , and the twists are great . The pacing is pretty much spot-on , this is never boring . The acting is almost invariably good , with Depp , Gambon , Ricci and Richardson all delivering impeccable performances . Even Van Dien and the children tend to be convincing . The script is well-written , and the dialog is marvelous . This is rather stylized , and yes , it is , arguably , comical at times . The choreography is masterful . If you dig Ray Park , you are likely to be entertained ( a lot ) by this . It is exciting and imaginative , as well , both very much so . The effects are astounding . I would advise against reading the cast-list before watching this , as it contains a spoiler . There is quite graphic violence and gore in this , some material is disturbing , and there is a little bit of mild sexuality and language . I recommend this to any fan of Tim Burton and / or anyone else involved in the film-making process .
Very good short film	It's rare to see a short film that is as funny or as well-made as this one . " Sex " , by Chad Peter is almost as funny , and " Drugs " , also by Peter , is about as well-made , but less entertaining . The main character is very well-played , and is very reminiscent of Woody Allen , and at times , Seinfeld . The plot is very good , believable and real ( yes , it is based on a true story , but still ) . It moves along at a nice , slow pace , yet still manages to entertain you and tell a full story , in just under 15 minutes . The non-linear timeline works very well in the film , and makes it interesting and re-watchable . The actors all perform good enough , considering that most of these are new at acting . The humor in the film is a mix of Woody Allen and Seinfeld . The film tells the story very professionally , while being very laid-back and funny , and it's edited together very well . I would imagine that most fans of short films will find this a worthy addition to the genre , and many wannabe filmmakers can learn a lot from how well it's put together . I recommend this to most fans of short films , it's quite entertaining and a good way to spend less than 15 minutes .
Lives up to the first	This review's single-player comments will be mainly based on the spin-off entitled The Secret Files , as I haven't completed the original for several years . This takes the familiar characters of the 1994 game , Jazz Jackrabbit , and puts them in a new one , with a more advanced ( due to improvements over the years ) engine , and utilizes it well to bring you more fun , cartoon-style platform action / adventure gaming . Yet again Devan Shell , the devious turtle , has something sinister in mind ; this time , Jazz has to chase him through time for the ring with which he had planned to wed Eva Earlong ( also from the first game ) , but he is joined by his brother Spazz ( who's got a flying karate kick to help dispatch enemies ) and in , introduced in The Secret Files , also his cousin , Lori ( who can do a martial arts move of her own . . . Jazz can do a Superman-y flight-upwards move ( for a second or so , not far up ) , and all three of them must have gotten training from Super Mario ( and there are things similar to other games , as well , including Earthworm Jim and Sonic The Hedgehog ) because they can now jump onto enemies for easy elimination , provided you press the whatever button you have assigned to Down while in the air ) . The game-play gets bigger and faster . The dynamic camera returns , this time more " loose " ( not in a bad way , you never lose track ) . The characters take up less of the screen , making for more elaborate setups ( in that you can see more of the level at any given point than in the first ) , and they make good use of it . While you can use the moves I mentioned earlier to take out foes , the game seems to tend to reward shooting them , more ( with things you can pick up ) , but fear not , your main gun is still outfitted with infinite ammunition . Not only that , but pick up enough Fastfires ( and keep yourself from losing lives ) and it'll turn into a darn machine-gun ( or at least an SMG , sub-machine gun ) . You can fire in both directions , like in the first , and now also upwards . There are other types of bullets ( same gun , though . . . gotta love technology ) , including a flame-thrower type one , an ice one that freezes the opponent it's fired at , and more . These can also be upgraded if you find the power-up . There are at least two other weapon-type upgrades , and they're awesome . I won't reveal what they are , here , that's for the players to discover for themselves . Not necessarily by themselves , however . . . this also offers multi-player mode . Internet , LAN , and on the same computer ( split-screen ) , using two different keyboard setups , two joysticks , or one player on each , a mix . As far as I know , you can at the most play four at the same time . There are five different modes of playing multi-player : Cooperative ( the players , in the main game , side by side and helping each other get to the end ) , Battle ( fighting each other , as the title of the chapter of Monty Python's Meaning of Life goes ) , Race ( more or less self-explanatory . . . get to the end before the other one does ) , Treasure Hunt ( get more gems than the other player ) and Capture the Flag ( now , that one is self-explanatory . . . grab the opposing player's flag ) . Graphics are smooth , detailed and gorgeous . Backgrounds are done in 3D , offering a marvelous sense of depth , and the camera helps this well . The colorful , cartoony tone of the first is kept up , as is the humor . There are plenty of things to pick up . . . some are for points , others are power-ups , and of course not all are easy to reach . Each time you get a certain amount of points , you get a Sugar Rush , where for a number of seconds , you can just touch enemies , and they'll croak . The level design is great , throughout . There is plenty of creativity and imagination found in it . And it doesn't have to be limited to just theirs , either . . . the game comes with the Jazz Creation Station ( which , along with the spin-offs , is not available for Mac users ; The Secret Files adds new " tiles " , most of which are from the first Jazz Jackrabbit ) , a fully functional level editor , and this is reasonably easy to use ( if nothing else , at least considering how much it lets you do ) , works flawlessly , and actually seems to have everything needed to make levels as intricate as that of the game , itself . Of course , you don't have to make that much of an effort , if you don't want to . . . levels can be made as big or small as you like , and may have any look that you see in the game itself , as far as I've been able to tell . The game is very entertaining , and of reasonable length ( without being too long ) . This adds spring pads ( much like those featured in Sonic The Hedgehog ) , and Jazz can now use his ears like a propellor , to slow down his fall ( just like . . . yup : Earthworm Jim ) , while Spaz gets a double-jump ( he is something of an athletic type , isn't he ? Well , Jazz got the looks ) . Sound is nicely done , and fitting . Music is hip and cool . The AI , well , the foes will sometimes seek you out , if you enter the area they patrol or wait , or attack if you come close enough , but Jazz Jackrabbit , the game and the series , were never about outsmarting enemies . They tend to have set paths / movement modes , to patrol and / or to attack , and once you figure those out , it can be pretty easy to avoid getting hit , whilst making short work of them . The game , like one of the bonus episodes of the first , has swimming , but it's not as fun as the first . The difficulty settings help ensure that beginners can safely approach , and that more seasoned players may still be challenged . This is definitely worth playing if you liked the first , and / or if you just in general enjoy platform gaming . I recommend this to anyone who feels that aforementioned traits fit them , and / or who's developed an interest in playing it , from reading this review , that you're reading now .
Even more videos by Al , and this time . . . there're specials !	Since Al hadn't made the last of his videos by ' 96 , it made sense to release this , an updated compilation music video DVD , and this time , they put some special features on , as well . Two of these are more things you can watch . . . a live performance of Another One Rides The Bus on something called The Tomorrow Show , from 1981 , where Al has the music side ( in addition to himself on the accordion ) helped by his partner , Jon Schwartz playing , among other things , a piece of luggage ( it'll make sense when you see it . . . no , seriously , it will ) , and some select clips of The Weird Al Show ( which are amusing and very " Al " ) , including the intro ( which is really good ) . In total , these come to about eight minutes , bringing the full running time of this DVD up to one hour and about 33 minutes . Also featured is a photo gallery with production stills of the various videos . Lastly , there are subtitles for all of the viewable material ( lyrics whenever something is sung ) , and while these may not get everything right ( I can't for sure tell if they do or not ) , they're good to have and a great help for following the songs ( and hey , if you don't like them , they can be turned off , ah , the wonder of the medium of DVD ) . Of course , there are also the three new videos from the master of absurd comedy and parody-making ; Bob , which will have you marveled at how many palindromes Al could find and make work ( to spoof the incomprehensible singing of Bob Dylan ) , It's All About The Pentiums , Baby ( featuring Drew Carey , no less , presumably due to being connected to sitting in a cubicle ) , which is a rather skillful re-writing of It's All About The Benjamins , Baby , to make P . Diddy's song be about computers rather than making money , and finally , The Saga Begins , which retells the story of Star Wars : Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace , in a fairly straight-forward manner . The flow of the videos isn't bad . The menus are set up well , and it's easy to find your way around , though the video selection could perhaps be better , it's too easy get lost in . All in all , definitely worth owning for any fan of Weird Al . If it's this or ' Weird Al Yankovic : The Videos , for the same price , I'd advise you to choose this . I recommend this to any fan of Weird Al Yankovic and / or parody songs / videos .
Wraps up the trilogy well , and what a way to go	This completes the new series , and takes the consequence of the ones before it , similar to how Warrior Within ( the saving method of which this retains ) built on the first . It has elements of both of them , and adds quite a lot ( and far more than aforementioned earlier sequel ) . You may still wield two weapons , but now the choice of the other one . . . sword , mace , dagger or axe . . . affects the way you do so , in the range , force , etc . of the blows . There are still many different ones within those four kinds . The Free Form Fighting System is also still in use , so spamming powerful attacks is still possible , however , this comes closer to The Sands of Time in the combat , with more strategy and tactics necessary , among other things because of those archers . . . arrows in general are present in this , and they are very welcome . The battles are longer and tougher , and do not get tedious like they did in the one immediately preceding this . Making things interesting is also the fact that you no longer use a lengthy blade as usual . . . and I will leave it at that , lest I spoil something . One can also tell that the good people at Ubisoft had Splinter Cell on their mind . . . a couple of the new moves are right out of those , and stealth is a genuine option at several places . They make it work , and it doesn't stand out as ( much as ) one might think . Speed Kills are part of this . . . and no , that's not a campaign telling us to slow down on the freeway , nor one against that particular drug . It's a way to take out opponents , typically when they aren't yet aware of your proximity , and all you truly need is to get the timing right , albeit the first time you try the specific ones , before you know what's coming , you will have to react split-second , as well as not get trigger-happy . It works impeccably well , and really adds to this . The Bosses vary , but at their best , they're incredible . The plot is great , picking up where the last one left off , confirming which of the endings they used , and taking you through one place that had yet to be visited in these three . . . The Prince's home , Babylon . Only it's not how he remembers it , and you'll soon find out why . The idea is magnificent , and making your way through the city is entertaining . As a character , he grows and develops a lot in this , and this really does close this version , these post-2000 entries , well . The voice acting is all satisfactory . Yuri is back , and thankfully , he left the vast majority of the emo back in the first one , but he did bring the humor with him , as well as what comes of his inner talks with his . . . other half ( who's got a nasty case of cynicism ) . Yes . In this , you also get to control the Dark side of the leading man sometimes , who's stronger , but whose life gradually drains , one of the aspects of this making for serious tension . Does the word Daggertail mean anything to you ? Once you've gotten to use it in this , it definitely will . It is a lot of fun , downright addictive , and a marvelous spice for the squaring off against enemies ( and it can be used at points for maneuvering , marvelous ) . You once again get to use the special abilities . The chariot racing is pure awesomeness captured perfectly . The foes are relatively diverse , and less annoying than those of WW . The camera is a little limited , compared to the ones before this , and the panoramic view is less available , and once or twice , even kinda phoned in . The story-telling is similar to SoT . This gets you into it the fastest , and is also the shortest of them . There are graphic glitches and even bugs beyond the others , and it is sadly not as stable , either . This can be disturbing , though it is not as bleak as the second one . There are grotesque creatures herein . The tone is a mix of the others . The style is achieved well , and this uses slow-motion rather well . This also requires patience , reflexes , fingers adept at VG's , and time . The AI is nice , in that they all respond and act the way you'd expect them to . The re-playability is reasonable , you earn Sand Credits as you go , and if you get them all , you will unlock everything , in all of the artwork galleries . And you may just gain something else , as well . The videos ( sadly , sans subtitles , although mostly , you can tell what's said ) become available upon completion , all but one are the ones you watched along the way in this , and that one is an absolutely hilarious , if criminally brief , gag reel . The cut-scenes are well-done , and can be fairly effective . The CGI is utterly stunning . The animation and look of everything is fantastic . The level design is perhaps the tiniest step down from earlier in these , here and there , but overall it remains at the high quality of them . They utilize the new moves and acrobatics unbelievably well . The puzzles are still well-done , and this can be challenging , and should satisfy a decent range of people , with three difficulty settings . Do you like those ledges that fall off after you step on them ? Well , they've made a triumphant return . The audio is well-done , everything sounds the way it should , and the music is nice . The heavy metal of the middle chapter is gone . The attitude towards nudity in this is the same as the earlier two , but it does somehow seem less provocative . The violence is debatable , but there is some blood . There is next to no gore . Language is nonexistent . I recommend this , and the entire franchise up to this point ( the pre-beginning of new millennium-ones are immensely well-done , as well , they just happen to be old , and you can tell ) , to any fan of action-adventure titles , anyone who enjoys the culture , and all who appreciate swordsmanship in games .
Now this is more like what an RTS add-on should be	As enjoyable as Covert Ops , for Command & Conquer , and Counterstrike , the first add-on for Red Alert , were , this offers more , both in amount and in how solid what is added is . . . I don't think it is hyperbole to say that this raised the standard for RTS add-ons . 18 new single-player missions , almost as much as an entirely new game . 100 more multi-player maps , the same amount that Counterstrike also added ( I have not been able to determine how many , or if any , were added to Command & Conquer by Cover Ops ) . Best of all , there are 7 new units . They all both increase fairness and the strategy level of the game . They also make things even more interesting and entertaining . Among them are the Missile Sub for the Soviets , which make them much more of a threat as far as naval attacks go , by combining the destructive force of the Allied Cruiser ( ! ) with the stealth of a regular Sub . They also get a Shock Trooper , which not only fires bolts of electricity a la the Tesla Coil , but cannot be run over , and make for by far the best anti-vehicle infantry that the franchise had to offer by this point . A Tesla Tank is also added , and much more properly done than the few half-hearted attempts there were at such in Counterstrike . The Allied don't get cheated ; they get a Mechanic , who is to vehicles what the Medic is to infantry ; a healing unit that can save your attack force . They also get a Chrono Tank , which can Chrono Shift when it has full power ( which it starts with ) , and won't go back to it's original starting point after a while , like Chrono-Shifted units usually are . Firing missiles and being able to teleport right up to enemy units , this makes for an effective surprise attack unit , and can take down enemy Harvesters before the enemy'll know what hit them , and effectively take out Flame Towers from a safe distance . These units greatly improve the multi-player experience , which says quite a bit . They re-new the game-play for multi-player , and provide plenty of new tactics . Other things are changed around . . . both sides now have the ability to purchase Rocket Soldiers , since it's the only infantry unit that can be used as anti-aircraft defense , to give a quick example . Like the add-ons preceding this , this doesn't seem to feature any new cut-scenes , but rather re-use ones from the original Red Alert . A few of these are stretched a little , to fit in the context of the mission , but fewer , comparatively , going by how many missions there are in either , than was the case in Counterstrike . The story is fairly loose ( and there really isn't any between the missions ) , I could not , for the life of me , determine when this was supposed to take place ( and as with the other add-ons , this doesn't tell you how the war is going , and unlike Counterstrike , which had just a few , this doesn't tell you where you're fighting , both things that also take some of the excitement and sense of importance out of the battles ) . Several characters that seemed to have died at this point appear again . Also , while much of this utilizes what Red Alert has well , as well as make great use of the new units added , some of the limitations of the engine are glaringly obvious in their inability to meet some of the expectations and ambitions of the developers , such as when two characters have a conversation in one particular level . The level design is rather good , though once or twice it does feel like a mission was just designed to be a challenge , without providing much explanation for it ( which , again , takes you out of the experience some ) , and while they are exciting , the difficulty ( which seems to pick up where Counterstrike left off , making for some very challenging and exciting missions ) remains a little uneven , and I'm not sure there really are any that are as outstanding as some of the Counterstrike ones were ( although , with how many there are , and how high the quality remains throughout ( Counterstrike had several entries that were fairly weak ) , this is a somewhat minor complaint ) . I would say that , however , that each level manages very well to be unique . . . no part of the add-on really felt like it was just revisiting something we had already seen or done . I'm not sure I'd claim that either side has a particularly satisfying finish , either ( though both are fairly challenging ) , as the original game most certainly had . . . and Counterstrike at least had a reasonably good one for the Allied side . Still , this is by all means worth getting . Every mission is enjoyable , and more multi-player maps for a game that features great multi-player is never a bad thing . Tanya makes more appearances , and there is one new level that takes place inside a facility , and it's reasonably good . Volkov of Counterstrike , and his cybernetic dog Chitzkoi , re-appear a few times . One mission also gives you control of a thoroughly interesting unit that unfortunately doesn't appear at any other point ( well , once , but it isn't really used ) . Some levels are timed to heighten the tension . Several of the missions have thoroughly interesting stories and are based on concepts that are equally interesting . You may find yourself fighting forces you had not expected to . Through skillful level creation and capable enemy AI programming , each mission is entertaining to play and requires tactical thinking and strategic action to complete . This is the more well-rounded add-on , and I would say it surpasses Counterstrike , though that was also a fine effort , in its overall quality and entertainment value . It should be noted that this , along with Counterstrike , does not seem to be within the overall story of the Red Alert series . . . these are more battles to fight within that universe based on the engine of the first game , but there is really no more story told . I recommend this to fans of Red Alert who want more expertly done missions for it .
A bit of a letdown plot-wise , but beautiful cinematography	The first thing I noticed in this movie was the cinematography . It is truly amazing , the camera angles , they are nothing short of stunning . The sound is also amazing , as is nearly everything about the visual side of the film . While it was a bit of a letdown on the plot side , I can't say I was really disappointed by anything else in the film . The plot moves a bit slow , but it does get going about half an hour into the film , and as soon as it gets going , it does keep your interest , while it keeps moving along somewhat well-paced . The acting is , for the most part , satisfactory if nothing more , a few good performances , but always above average , nothing that detracts from the movie . The locations are very convincing , they truly look like something out of late 1800's . It should be noted that I have not read the original graphic novel , but I am a fan of Alan Moore , its author ( which is the very reason I watched it to begin with ) . Something I have to mention are the clairvoyant dreams that the main character has ; these are truly amazing , beautifully filmed , very creepy . The atmosphere is creepy , thoroughly , throughout the entire film . The old-English is also convincing , when spoken by the main character as well as by any of the minor characters . Not for everyones tastes , but should be somewhat enjoyable to most people , especially people who enjoy good cinematography and atmosphere .
Good , but not sure if I would call it great	I haven't seen too many of the Coen brothers ' films , in fact , the only ones I've seen apart from this one are Intolerable Cruelty and The Man Who Wasn't There . This one didn't hold my attention like The Man Who Wasn't There and it didn't make me laugh as often as Intolerable Cruelty . It was quite funny at some points , no doubt about that , and often it was far more funny than most other comedies . . . but too many of the jokes seemed to be repeated over and over . The pregnant lady eating , the locals saying ' yah ' , William H . Macy's character stuttering or throwing a fit . . . I don't know , it seemed like the Coen's couldn't think of enough good jokes , so they just repeated those they had over and over . Some of the jokes are insanely funny , though . Most of these come from Steve Buscemi . Just about every scene he's in , he steals the show . When he's not on screen , you're usually somewhat bored . One thing I also found myself getting a bit annoyed over the things left unresolved , and the scenes that seemed pointless . There were several characters in the film that could easily have been written out with no change to the overall product , apart from making it move faster . The plot is good , original and full of clever twists . The pacing is somewhat good , but too much of the film is boring . Like I said , Buscemi saves every scene he's in , but it's often boring in scenes not involving him . The acting is good , for the most part . Frances McDormand gives a great performance . The rest of the leads are all credible . The characters are well-written and credible . The humor is good , and at times great . A pretty good Coen brothers ' film that could have been better . Too slow-moving and repetitive for my tastes , but definitely worth a watch , especially for fans of Steve Buscemi . I recommend it to fans of the Coen's , Steve Buscemi and the other principal actors .
" You got a bad attitude , Wells . "	I have not watched Rio Bravo , so I hope you'll forgive me for not referencing it at all in this . With that out of the way . . . could the 90 minutes of this possibly have been any more intense than they are ? I sincerely doubt that . I have yet to be able to look away from the screen when watching this . Carpenter knows how to make films , and obviously did even at the very start of his career , and not only that , but he knows exactly how to make them for shoestring budgets . This has got suspense and thrills enough to sustain several features . Fairly early , this tells the audience that it is not holding back . The action is excellent , and the unpredictability to it further helps the tension . Exposition and character ( all of which are well-written and credible ) development are delivered smoothly . The acting is pretty good , the only actually bad of it is by the kid , and expectations are automatically low for most of them , anyway . The dialog is great , and the one-liners are instantly quotable and memorable . The sense of humor is marvelous , no gag or joke is overdone , nor seems out of place . The atmosphere and mood are masterfully achieved . This is relatively disturbing . The plot is marvelous , and wastes no time . The build-up is flawless . The pacing is spot-on . The score is haunting , and well-done , as those John makes tend to be . There is some violence , but no real gore , nor much blood . There is also language , moderately strong , if little in amount . The DVD holds a director's commentary . I recommend this to any fan of John Carpenter and his work .
Another one of those good films that could have been great	The fictional story of The Jackal ( though I do believe that there once existed a man with the very same codename and of the same profession ; well , technically , he still does exist , as he's still alive , but incarcerated ) is a great piece of literature ( so I understand ; unfortunately , I haven't had the pleasure of reading the book by Frederick Forsyth myself , but I understand it's excellent ) . Fortunately , it translates onto the silver screen pretty well . Unfortunately , it didn't get a better director than Fred Zinnemann , who I haven't seen other films by , but I assume he just either didn't " get it " enough to do it right , or he just lacked the talent to keep the story interesting and give it the amount of tension that it needs . However , whatever it is , it's certainly too bad . The story is great ; the film could have been too . The plot is very , very good , but it drags a little too much , and the pace is too slow for a movie that expects you to sit through 145 minutes , just under two and a half hours . The direction is a little sloppy , and unless you're very interested in knowing about The Jackal and his mission , which I admittedly was the first time I saw it , you probably won't sit through the entire thing , simply because in the end , it's just too stale and boring . The acting is good ; I didn't find any of the characters poorly portrayed . The characters are well-written and credible , but I'm not sure whether to chalk that up to Forsyth or the scriptwriter . From what I understand , the film is a fairly good and accurate depiction of the book . The cinematography is nothing special . The film doesn't do that good a job of creating suspense or tension . The direction is , like I said , somewhat stale . Unless you're very interested in watching an accurate , realistic and fairly thorough depiction of how a truly professional assassin goes about assassinating one of the most powerful men in the world , you won't enjoy this movie . That digs quite a chunk out of the audience , I would imagine . Then again , maybe there are a lot of people who , like me , enjoy watching an entirely professional assassin conduct " business " . All in all , a fairly good thriller , but only for a limited crowd and doesn't stand repetition too good , since , well , once you know how it ends , the film has nothing left to offer , apart from the good story , which you might as well read ( since , by most accounts , the book is better ) . I recommend it to fans of films dealing with assassins and assassinations , as well as very big fans of thrillers . If you do not like this movie within the first few minutes , then you most likely won't like it at all . Just a little warning to those who find the direction as bland as I do . Good , but could ( and most certainly should ) have been great .
About as bleak and depressing as they get , but in no way a bad movie	After just seeing this film , I'm pretty much speechless . This is a tough film to comment on . This is mainly due to the fact that it's a serial killer film where you actually end up feeling sympathy for the killer . Near the end of the film , when it goes completely out of control for Aileen Wuornos , there's no feeling of " justice is done once again " . . . quite the contrary , actually . It's so moving and disturbing , following this person's life , through the last part of it . In the beginning , we get a fairy tale-like presentation of Aileen's hopes and dreams in her young years . Without warning , we're thrust into the hard reality of her current years , immediately afterward . From there on out , we're in her world , feeling her pain , experiencing her failures . We get to know her as the film goes on , but we feel for her from the very beginning , without even knowing why she is like she is . That says something about the masterful direction and writing of Patty Jenkins that is featured in this film . The plot is great , and it's surprisingly easy to follow the thought process of Aileen . . . we understand why she kills . The pacing is very good , there are only few scenes that seem to move slow , and I don't think there was really any point where I was bored . The locations is incredibly authentic . Jenkins actually went out of her way to get shooting done at several places where the real Aileen had been , and even cast people who had met her in smaller roles . Cinematography is great . Acting is pretty much flawless ; both Theron and Ricci shine in their roles . The movie also has a unpleasant view of prejudice from the ' other side ' ( the people who become victims to prejudice ) , and hopefully this will act as a much needed wakeup call for the people who believe in and go by prejudice . What really makes this film have an impact is how dark and real it is . No happy ending , no silver lining . . . just tough , uncut reality . When you see it , you can't help getting engulfed in this person's world . The raw horror of her life moves you . I can't see anyone , no matter ignorance , beliefs or moral and ethic standpoint coming out after seeing this film and believing that Eileen was the ' bad guy ' in this story . It's just not possible . I haven't seen any of the interviews with the real Aileen Wuornos and I didn't follow her case , but I would like to know more about her , find out what she was like to a greater extent than a movie of 1 hour and 45 minutes can tell me . That's what this movie did to me . It made me care for this person , and that says more than anything I can put in this review . You need to see this film , unless you refuse to watch anything that has harsh reality instead of a happy ending . I recommend this to anyone who can take it . This movie will depress most people , but after this one viewing , I consider it required viewing for just about anyone .
Quite entertaining , and worth it for fans of the X-Men	I haven't played the first game , mainly due to its non-PC ( as in computer , not politically correct ) release , though I remember seeing game-play trailers and the likes in 2004 . I borrowed this game from a friend , and quickly got into it . You control members of the two well-known Marvel groups , The X-Men and The Brotherhood of Mutants . The plot is quite simple , though fairly well-written ; both Xavier and Magneto find themselves with separate reasons for leading a battle against Apocalypse . . . the original mutant . They team up , and the player is allowed to pick and choose warriors from both groups . The game plays as a non-turn-based action RPG , with running around , fighting , picking up items , collecting experience points , leveling up , etc . The game-play is entertaining , if somewhat repetitive . It mostly consists of fighting . Usually , you're driven by some objective , which is almost without exception to destroy or activate an object . The levels are mission-based , so in-between each actual mission , you talk to people around the base camp ( one of the five there are throughout the game ) and receive new missions . For each mission , there is a briefing , which informs you of the objectives , provides background as well as serve to display the rather shaky alliance the two teams have . The game is divided into five acts , at the end of any of which , you're treated to a brief cut-scene which furthers the story some ( and all of which are rather well-done , I must say ) and a change of scenery ( aka , the camp ) . In the camp , you're also allowed to buy and sell equipment , review how much you've collected ( I'll get to that in a minute ) , store equipment and use the Danger Room computer . Last-mentioned works to provide extra challenges , in the form of " courses " ( often " survive for this long " or " defeat this amount of enemies " ) to take , and when you complete these , you are awarded bonuses . Scattered around the levels are the collect-able items . . . these include discs for the Danger Room ( which unlock the courses ) , sketch books that unlock artwork for the game , etc . The main game has you leading a team of four mutants , in which you can control any of the four ( and you can switch between which you control at the push of a button ) . There are two standard attacks , a jump and a grab move ( which , if your character is strong enough , will allow you to throw enemies or debris ( you can destroy much of the debris and pick up some of it ; not quite with the ease or to the extent of the Hulk game , but still good ) ) , and lastly , a number of power-up attacks . These take some energy to execute , energy which slowly replenishes over time , and which you can also pick up energy packs to fill up . You can have four of these powers ready for use at any one time , and switching between which of the ones those are ( there are more than four for each character , though I can't provide an exact count ) is also simply at the push of a button ( or , rather , two at the same time ) . The powers are , in a word , awesome . Storm'll hurl a lightning bolt at her opponent . Jean Grey can throw people around like rag-dolls with her telekinesis . Toad attacks with his tongue . . . and that's just a small taste . Nightcrawlers teleportation alone makes for incredibly entertaining play , as does the flight ability of several of the mutants ( though , as far as I can tell , no attacks can be performed whilst airborne ) . The boss fights are good , if a few of them are somewhat more tedious than challenging . Several of the boss enemies even yelled out tips on how to beat them , though I'm confident that that's only for the lower difficulties . I must say , however , the very last one is rather interesting , and fairly entertaining to play ( if one enjoys this kind of game at all , and it doesn't exactly hurt to be a fan of the Marvel universe ) . Several of the mutants you meet and talk to , throughout the game , introduce you to them ( if you ask them to ) , stating their full name and mutant power ( occasionally even who they are related to ) . The interface is good , and the controls are simple , though allowing for easy execution of the various fighting moves and such . There are , I'm afraid , still some cracks in the otherwise polished facade . . . the AI could have been better . Several enemies wait around for you ( as opposed to flat-out attacking ) if they are long enough away ( even though you can see them ) , others try to attack you through indestructible walls . . . then again , the team members ( which are automatically controlled by the computer , unless you play multi-player , something I've yet to try ) work fairly good , and you'll never see one going over the side of a cliff . You can " call " them to you , though I found myself more in need of a " spread out " command , since they tend to flock around you ( bad idea for enemies that do radial damage ) . The level design is somewhat uncreative , and I found myself annoyed by the overly long halls and the overwhelming amount of different ways to go ( though reasonably good freedom of movement ) . You're often in a small area , making the fighting somewhat cramped . The camera is dynamic , meaning , it moves when you do . This can ( but mostly won't ) mess up some fighting and movement , since it'll turn and thereby alter the controls to fit it . Voice acting is hit-and-miss . . . Wolverine and Beast , for example , are spot-on . Meanwhile , Nightcrawler sounds like Klaus out of American Dad and Sabretooth is so overdone , he inspires chuckles rather than fear . The mini-map is about as much trouble as it is help . Few of those are good , anyway , but System Shock 2 managed to do excellent at it . The enemy design also leaves something to be desired , and there are some coding / animation flaws ( though none are critical ) . Still , very good game of a good length ( took me 25 hours playing time ) and the comic-book graphics fit exceptionally well . I recommend this to any fan of the Marvel universe and of action RPG's .
Unpleasant but necessary	War movies are very different . Usually , these differences depend on the film-makers ' experience with war or knowledge of it . Occasionally , the time it was made and society's view towards it has its say in the matter too . This film was made by Oliver Stone , so naturally it's based on his experiences in the Vietnam war . Personally , I don't think there is a better war movie than All Quiet on the Western Front from 1979 , simply because it's beautiful , concise and effective without simply showing lots of stuff blowing up or killing off characters we can relate to . Despite that , this film is still worth watching , simply due to how well-directed and intense it is . The plot is quite good , and follows a single platoon through a period in ' 67 , during the Vietnam war . The pacing is good , though I felt that the film started somewhat slow only to later kick up to a very fast pace for a while . There didn't seem to be enough character development . I never picked up on all the names . Maybe there are too many major characters . That's something I often find in Stone's films , making them quite hard to sit through , and requiring more than one viewing to take it all in ( which shouldn't be necessary . . . he's not Kubrick , after all ) . The acting is great . The casting is great , not one character seems miscast . The special effects are great . The characters are credible , interesting and well-written . The direction and editing is talented and effective . The film has a few memorable scenes , and the dialog contains a good bit of quotable lines . Not much else to say about the film . . . it's quite graphic and very direct , so you should only watch it if you're completely certain that you can take it . Oh , and John C . McGinley is excellent in the film . I recommend this to any fan of anyone involved in the making of the film , Oliver Stone in particular and fans of war movies .
Not Amenábar's best , but quite possibly the best film concerning the phenomenon of snuff films	I've seen all of Alejandro Amenábar's features , except for Mar Adentro . This is less " Hollywood " than The Others , but I do find Abre Los Ojos to be a better film than this one ( have more flu-induced nightmares , Alejandro ! Just kidding ) , more themes , perhaps . That is by no means to disregard this film . . . never . It is a well-done psychological horror-thriller of well-established moods and atmosphere , and the themes explored , the questions raised . . . the film is sure to spark debate . A feature directing debut , this fact is at times evident . . . it has a slow pace at times , and seemed to move at a rather bland pace throughout the film . It often jumps from a potentially exciting scene to a dull one , as well . I won't claim that the plot is ingenious . . . it's , in fact , almost more of a vehicle for the themes . It drives the film just fine , but if what you want is a well-crafted mystery or crime story , look elsewhere . The direction has clever moments , and is just about flawless , throughout . The film manages to be somewhat unpredictable , by having many scenes take unexpected turns , but the mystery was a little predictable , and too easy to figure out ; who the villains were came as no real surprise . What I liked about it , what I really liked , was the way it questioned the idea of snuff films , and the way it further explored the reason snuff films exist . . . they didn't come out of nowhere or nothing , and this acknowledges that fact . It doesn't say that violence is wrong , nor does it claim that only mentally unstable people enjoy watching it . . . in fact , it takes a neutral stance on the subject , and lets the viewers decide for themselves . . . but not before showing us that even the most non-violent and emotionally stable person can - if only slightly - be driven towards watching and maybe even slightly enjoying violence , and / or being fascinated by death . Amenábar reaches out and pulls out everyone's dark side in this movie ; no one who watches it will come out entirely without questioning their own thoughts about violence . The acting is good , the characters are generally well-written , the film manages to build up a lot of suspense ( even though it is somewhat easy to figure out who the " bad guys " are ) and tension ( masterfully so ) . Near the middle of the film there is a truly claustrophobic sequence , which anyone suffering , even mildly , from claustrophobia will have a hard time getting through . The film carefully dodges most ( ! ) of the typical Hollywood clichés , and manages to keep the film interesting and exciting , despite being somewhat poorly paced . All in all , a thriller which should be worthwhile to , well , pretty much anyone . It doesn't require you to be a certain age to understand it ( though I will recommend that you are at least old and / or hardened enough to take the themes , and what violence is featured ) . This isn't about showing violence ( I challenge anyone to claim or prove the violence herein can be classified as exploitative , by almost any standard ) , all the violence shown is there for a reason . I recommend it to fans of horror-thrillers , in particular psychological ones , fans of Amenábar's other work , and people who just like a movie to mess with their minds a little , and have their values screwed up a little .
Excellent , worth owning for every fan	This DVD features seven videos by Eminem . . . in order , they are : Stan , The Way I Am , The Real Slim Shady , Role Model , Guilty Conscience , My Name Is and Just Don't Give A F . . . and two bonus presentations , a making of for the video of Stan , and something called The Mathers ' Home . I won't give away what the last thing is , it should be realized by anyone who watches it as they do ( it'll become evident within seconds ) . I'll just say that it was a great idea , and they executed it rather expertly . The " making of " has Dre and director Atwell talking to the camera some ( the former makes a very bad pun at one point ) , as well as Devon Sawa ( of Final Destination fame ) , who plays Stan , and Dido . It goes behind several of the things they did in the video , and at about 8 and a half minutes , it doesn't overstay its welcome , or really lose momentum . The videos themselves come to about half an hour , give or take some minutes . The other Special Feature lasts about five minutes , give or take . In total , it will come to almost fifty minutes . The DVD offers regular stereo sound , and Dolby Digital , and has no subtitles . I base this on the Region 2 release . The visuals are all crisp and high quality . The videos themselves , I personally think , are all good ( if not all equally ) . Stan is a great rap , and a rather good video , as well , of high story-telling quality . The Way I Am . . . what can I say ? Is there one single fan of Em who doesn't love that song , and the video for it , as well ? It is well deserved . The mixing in of the Steve Berman skit on The Marshall Mathers LP for the opening . . . magnificent , both in idea and execution . The Real Slim Shady is fun and funny , if the appearance of Bugz is perhaps sad , now . . . R . I . P . Proof , you too , R . I . P . , and take care , Marshall , you guys seemed close . Role Model is similarly funny , and , like Stan and The Way I Am , has him making fun of the parents and critics who call him a menace , if not as bitingly satirical as Stan , or as angry as The Way I Am . Guilty Conscience is a good video , and features some nice effects , though I'm personally not crazy about the chorus they put in it , albeit I can understand why . My Name Is , even if he has later come to hate it , is another fun song , and the social commentary and attitude is evident throughout . Just Don't Give A F is a fine finish , with the gritty , angry tone . The menus are nicely done . This is definitely worth it for any fan of the rapper and his music , in my seldom humble opinion . I recommend it to anybody who falls into aforementioned category , and warmly so .
Not much plot , but a very interesting study of the environment of alcoholics	I've been a fan of the diverse and clearly talented actor Steve Buscemi for quite a while , ever since I first saw Con Air back in ' 99 . Naturally , when I heard he'd directed and written a movie by himself , starring him , I wanted to see it . I found this to be more of a drama than a comedy , but it didn't really bother me . It didn't have much of a plot , but that didn't bother me either . The film is about Tommy ( Buscemi ) who's an alcoholic . He just lost his job , and his boss took over his pregnant girlfriend . So , what should he do ? Going to the local bar is probably low on the list of good ideas , but that's what he does . The plot is almost non-existent . . . then again , there's plenty of back-story to make up for it , and the movie has a pretty good pace , even though it moves kind of slow . The movie is primarily a study of the environment of alcoholics , and as such , it's great . Just great . There's tons of little details , thrown in here and there that don't really add to the plot , but rather to said study . The acting is mostly great . Buscemi is great , as always , and some of the supporting actors are equally good ; Baldwin and Sevigny , in particular . The characters are well-written and credible . The humor is a rarity in the film , but it is mainly a drama . Also , what little there is , is great . The environment presented is entirely realistic and accurate . There isn't really anything about it that seemed to just be put in there , everything is perfectly believable . The dialog is well-written . There wasn't a lot I didn't like about this film , apart from the few tell-tale signs of Buscemi's inexperience in the director chair ( long takes for no apparent reason , one or two acting performances that are either under - or overdoing it , the occasional odd camera angle ) , but I can see why many probably won't like it . It's not a fast film , it's not that fun , and the ending doesn't really resolve anything . Everyone is still caught in their respective situations , none of which are satisfactory . No major revelation is made by the end of the film . In the end , Buscemi just makes his point . . . that the life of an alcoholic is an empty one . Nothing else . Don't rent this to laugh or learn a useful lesson . Rent this to get insight into the day-to-day life of alcoholics and their environment . I recommend this to fans of Steve Buscemi and people who enjoy films that just indulge in study of a certain group of people . Not for those with low attention spans .
Marvelous thriller	When you hear such a great premise , you want to get to see the movie as soon as you can . . . but when you hear that such a talentless hack of a director gets to be in charge . . . we're talking , the man who , until Christoper Nolan came and built a new foundation for it , ruined the Batman franchise , after Tim Burton created two ( not equally , but still both ) grand entries . . . you feel , shall we say , less inclined to . Bottom line , I gave up on seeing this at the theaters for that reason , and now that I've finally gotten to see it ( on the TV ) , I certainly wish I had given it a chance to win me over , because tonight , that's just what it did . Schumacher may not possess much talent or directorial skills , but what he's got , he certainly puts to good use here . The film plays like an episode of " 24 " ( rather appropriate , with Sutherland in a role , one might say ) , everything happening in real-time and things being inter-cut and such . This , along with some very nice camera-work , keeps the intensity high and keeps the film moving constantly from the get-go . The plot is intelligently crafted and well told . The way it evolves ensures ( if the intensity won't ) that your eyes never drift off the screen . The characters are credible and interesting . The acting is top-notch , most notably by Sutherland and Farrell . The cinematography is masterful . The writing is magnificent . The villain is terrific , and the idea of keeping him hidden like that works excellently . The voice alone , maybe because that's all it is , a voice connected to a sniper rifle , is incredibly effective and scary . I read that Hitchcock originally wanted to do this in the late sixties . . . it's really too bad he didn't get a chance to . As good as Joel did , Hitchcock would have hit this one out the park . Very nice execution of a spectacular idea , but could have been just that little bit better . I recommend this to fans of thrillers and of the actors ( I'd say of Mr . Schumacher , too , but I strongly doubt he has any ) . Definitely worth a look .
Great drama , with a nice touch of humor	I mainly watched this to see Natalie Portman , as I've been a fan of hers for some time , and have been very impressed with most of her performances , but I have to admit , as I started watching it , I really liked it . It grabbed my attention immediately and never lost it . The plot is interesting and captivating ; it revolves around Timothy Hutton , who plays Willie , a late-20's piano player who returns to his home town after ten years , to meet his old friends and celebrate the 10-years high-school reunion with them . When he arrives , he quickly finds out that nothing really has changed in the last decade , at least not for his friends and the town in general . His friends are all still struggling with their love lives , their family and their lives in general . Among those friends are Tommy ( Matt Dillon ) , who has a girlfriend , and an affair with a married woman with a child ; Michael ( Noah Emmerich ) , who has settled down and gotten a family , and seems to be content and Paul ( Michael Rapaport ) , who's girlfriend has just broken up with him , because he couldn't commit after a long relationship , and who almost worships models , because he is very hung up on beauty . Willie quickly meets the new neighbor , or , rather , the new neighbors teen girl , Marty ( Natalie Portman ) , who almost immediately casts her love on him , despite their obvious age difference . The entire cast does a great job ; Timothy Hutton plays a great somewhat happy guy , who realizes that no one in his home town , where he grew up , have moved on , done something with their life , like he has . Matt Dillon gives a great performance as the former high school stud , who can't give up on either of the girls in love with him . Noah Emmerich plays a believable dependent father , who can't seem to raise his kids without his wife's help . Michael Rapaport portrays the hopeless dreamer who couldn't settle down with his girlfriend , and can't get over his ex . Natalie Portman gives a great performance as the Lolita-like Marty , who falls in love with someone she knows , deep down , that she can't be with . The characters are all well-written and interesting , and , despite the fact that there are so many , they all get the screen-time they deserve and require . I also enjoyed and somewhat liked every single character ; even the one played by Rosie O'Donnell , who I normally loathe , was entertaining and interesting . The humor in the film is great , it doesn't seem forced and it just blends in . The film doesn't have any of the cliches often associated with dramas that have a high school reunion in them . The actors all have great chemistry , and really make you believe that they are that character , not just an actor playing a part . I liked the " Wizard of Oz " theme and references , though I'm not entirely sure what to make of them . Either the city was " Kansas " , or it was " Oz " . Anyway , all in all , a great drama , with great humor and great acting . I recommend it to fans of any of the actors , fans of dramas and generally people looking for a good little film with an all-round great cast and believable characters .
Any teenager should watch this at some point	This came on the TV just as I was writing my review of Little Nicky , right after aforementioned title had ended . The title seemed familiar , so I decided to give it a chance . I hadn't expected the great film that I got out of it . This should be viewed by any teenager , at least once , at some point . The premise is as simple as this : put five typical but very different high school kids in detention the same day at the same place . The film follows them , as they spend the whole day at the school , and eventually warm up to each other , open up to each other and finally , grow to like and accept each other . This is one of the only John Hughes films ( of the ones he directed himself , at least ) that I've seen , so I'm not entirely familiar with his directing style , but I like what I've seen so far . The plot is very good , and a lot less pretentious than most teen comedies . It doesn't try too hard to be funny . . . it just is . The acting performances are all top-notch . The characters are well-written , credible and most importantly , interesting . The film keeps your interest better than most teen flicks . The humor is very good , not overly crude or offensive , but still teen-oriented . The dialog is well-written and equally well-delivered . A great film which should be seen by any teenager . I recommend it to anyone that is or has been a teenager .
A classic in so many ways	Many neglect that this isn't just a classic due to the fact that it's the first 3D game , or even the first shoot-'em-up . It's also one of the first stealth games , one of the only ( and definitely the first ) truly claustrophobic games , and just a pretty well-rounded gaming experience in general . With graphics that are terribly dated today , the game thrusts you into the role of B . J . ( don't even think I'm going to attempt spelling his last name ! ) , an American P . O . W . caught in an underground bunker . You fight and search your way through tunnels in order to achieve different objectives for the six episodes ( but , let's face it , most of them are just an excuse to hand you a weapon , surround you with Nazis and send you out to waste one of the Nazi leaders ) . The graphics are , as I mentioned before , quite dated and very simple . The least detailed of basically any 3D game released by a professional team of creators . If you can get over that , however ( and some would suggest that this simplicity only adds to the effect the game has on you ) , then you've got one heck of a good shooter / sneaking game . The game play consists of searching for keys , health and ammo , blasting enemies ( aforementioned Nazis , and a " boss enemy " per chapter ) of varying difficulty ( which , of course , grows as you move further in the game ) , unlocking doors and looking for secret rooms . There is a bonus count after each level is beaten . . . it goes by how fast you were ( basically , if you beat the ' par time ' , which is the time it took a tester to go through the same level ; this can be quite fun to try and beat , and with how difficult the levels are to find your way in , they are even challenging after many play-throughs ) , how much Nazi gold ( treasure ) you collected and how many bad guys you killed . Basically , if you got 100 % of any of aforementioned , you get a bonus , helping you reach the coveted high score placings . The game ( mostly , but not always ) allows for two contrastingly different methods of playing . . . stealthily or gunning down anything and everything you see . You can either run or walk , and amongst your weapons is also a knife . . . running is heard instantly the moment you enter the same room as the guard , as is gunshots . Many guards are found standing with their backs turned to you , meaning that you can walk up behind them and stab them . . . nearly silently . In your inventory , you can get no less than four weapons and two keys . . . more about the weapons later . The keys unlock certain doors . Most doors in the game aren't locked . . . only two kinds need keys , and these keys are only introduced in later levels ( you restart in levels , resetting weaponry , health , score and lives in each chapter ) . Much of the later game is spent looking for them . Now , as I just alluded to , this game , like many of the period ( late 80's , early 90's ) , is based on collecting extra lives . . . personally , I think it's completely and utterly useless ( it was mercifully dropped from here on end . . . I think ( ? ) , from the next 3D shooter and onwards ) , since you can save anytime you want and ' using a life ' resets weaponry , health and ammo , like starting on a new chapter ( which is a real pain in later levels , where you need heavier artillery ) . Now , I shall beat around the bush no longer . . . moving on to the guns ! You start with aforementioned knife ( which is silent but only effective up close ) and a pistol . . . nothing special , but good for conserving ammo , unlike the next two bad boys . Your third weapon is a German SMG . . . a sub-machine-gun . It's faster and automatic , and some later enemies use it . And the last one . . . is nothing short of a Gatling gun ! Oh yeah ! Think T2 . Think Predator . Think about unloading massive amounts of lead into Nazi fiends with such a gun . It's every bit as entertaining as it sounds . Most of the boss enemies use this , though , so be prepared . I won't reveal the identities of these boss enemies , however . . . that's for each player to discover for him ( or her ) self . The sound is excellent . . . very crisp and realistic . As you hear the tear of a machine-gun firing , the deafening metallic clank of a door slamming shut behind you or a Nazi yelling surprised or a warning in German , you truly feel like you are there , trapped in these dark and depressing bunker systems . That segues me nicely into the level design . . . as you run through seemingly countless , nearly identical hallways towards the next elevator leading you further , you are grasped by the claustrophobic mood . I almost got motion sickness more than once ( though that might also have something to do with little sleep , lots of humidity and unusual warmth . . . ) from playing . Though the level of detail isn't terribly high , what there is is great . Remains of victims , guards ' quarters and countless Nazi symbols . . . the list goes on . The game also features quite a bit of gore . . . for it's limited graphics engine , John Romero and crew certainly put in all the blood and guts that they could for the game . What is there left to say . . . the first of its kind , and it's no wonder this spawned countless others 3D shooters . Sure , weapon bobbing and different height levels ( stairs and such ) didn't come around until the next entry into the genre . . . Doom . . . and it was Duke Nukem 3D that introduced the feature of switching your view ( so it goes beyond simply left and right , adding vertical dimensions to it ) , and jumping didn't come around until a third , later title ( the first Quake , possibly ? Fellow gamers , help me out here ) . . . but all of those games , as well as the rest of the genre , owe their existence to this one . So load up the Luger , open the door to enter the bunker and step into B . J . ' s shoes . . . he deserves the recognition , even ( or maybe even especially ? ) nearly fifteen years after he first appeared . I recommended this to all fans of 3D games .
A fantastic look at them	This is a feature delving into comics , telling the history of them ( spanning seven decades , from the 1930's to present day ) and offering marvelous ( pun intended ) insights . It consists of interviews , clips of footage that fits ( almost none from the movies , whilst that is also a subject one could explore , this stays on the aforementioned topic , and is better for it ) and a number of covers , frames and panels , several of which are famous , with the whole thing narrated by the booming , powerful voice of Keith David ( the order of those two names make a tremendous difference ) . It is rather informational , as well as entertaining , interesting and , believe it or not , engaging . Those who get a chance to talk have things to say , if one could have wished a greater amount of time was spent on some of these magnificently talented men , but I suppose they didn't want to lose focus , and this doesn't ever become the story of one specific hero ( whether or not favoring is entirely avoided here is up for debate ) . The tone is respectful and you never feel talked down to or judged , it is presented in a neutral way and the viewer gets to make up their own mind , with a few exceptions . The editing is nicely done , and while containing a little flash , similar to what the media often does , it does not get to be obnoxious or campy . While she is listed as a host , I did not see Peta Wilson in this , I don't know if I watched an alternate version or such . There is a tad of sexuality , violence and other controversial material in this , as seen in various releases ( and anyone bothered by the . . . appearance of Dr . Manhattan may want to avert their eyes at one particular point in this ) , and an occurrence or three of mild language . I recommend this warmly to any graphic novel fan , and / or anyone who wants to learn more about comic books . . . honestly , it's so open , anybody could watch it .
Excellence continues in one of the most memorable entries	This is quite probably the most mentioned and possibly even watched of the movies concerning The Olsen Gang . The reason is one scene that defines the genius that is the writing and directing that is Bahs and Balling and the Olsen-Banden movies : The scene at the Danish Royal theater , featuring both the Overture of Elverhøj and one of this country's two National Anthems . Just about everyone reading this probably already knows exactly what the scene details . . . and anyone who doesn't should not simply read about it . It's one of the most unforgettable scenes in movie history , as far as comedy goes . For my money , anyone who considers them-self to possess a sense of humor should watch this scene at least once , and it doesn't hurt to see it more than that . I've watched this film so much that the VHS tape is worn . . . and I'm still enjoying the scene immensely and noticing amazing details about it . The plot is well-written and interesting . Including nobility was a marvelous idea , and they have a lot of fun with the class . The pacing is right on . . . I was never bored for a second . The adding of Fie , Børge's girlfriend is great , and Lene Brøndum did a lot with an amount of lines that could practically be counted on a hand . Her facial and body language do most of her acting , and it works great . Ernst Meyer provides a delightfully Franco-phile chef . Bent Mejding gives an incredible performance in the small role of the conductor . And Asbjørn Andersen deserves a mention . . . his last role , a cameo , and then one so fitting . It could be argued that he portrays himself . The humor is very sophisticated and retains the human touch that makes these films stand head and shoulders above the typical Danish comedy of this period ( whilst , admittedly , many of them are hilarious ) . There is a very small amount of cartoony humor in this one , but it's such a brief occurrence , it makes little difference one way or the other . The police are made fun of again , and this time , the granting of medals and such are added to the parody pile . There appears to be a common theme between this and the former . . . that of workers having outlived the time they grew up in and preferred to live in . " The good old days " are no more , so to speak . A bit in this that begs mention is when Poul Bundgaard and Ove Verner Hansen , who were both opera singers , both emit some rather deep vocal sounds . There's an added touch of irony when Bundgaard , being asked what it was he just did , replies " I don't know ! " whilst grinning nervously . A thoroughly well-written and highly entertaining film in a great series . I recommend this to any fan of the series and / or of Danish comedy in general . I'd suggest you make sure to have watched as many of the previous films as you can first , for important background and character knowledge .
Very good , at least for a directorial debut	When a famous actor directs a film for the first time , you're always a bit anxious . Can he / she direct as well as he / she can act ? Jodie Foster proved that it is possible with Little Man Tate , and Ben Stiller turned in a surprisingly good attempt with Cable Guy . This is Robert De Niro's first film as a director , and I must say , he fares quite well . The film gets your interest almost instantly and introduces you nicely to the environment and the characters . Unfortunately , somewhere around the middle point , I lost interest in it . I don't know if I just thought there were far too many characters to keep track of , if it took too long for it to take off or if it simply went too slow altogether . . . but I didn't pay much attention to the last half of the movie . The film is independent , and it shows . No big-budget stuff , but just sufficiently high production value to keep you watching . The plot is pretty good , and very well-written . I must admit , the film kept surprising me , even though it was somewhat clichéd and by-the-numbers . The pacing starts out fine , but it fails about half-way through . The acting is good , pretty much all-round , though a few actors ( most noticeably , Lillo Brancato ) are bad . The dialog is fairly well-written , with a few very quotable lines . Good film with a good message , but you can tell that it's a first time direction effort . I recommend this to fans of Robert De Niro , Chazz Palminteri and / or anyone else involved in the production of the film .
Is black comedy , Gothic visuals and plenty of action and puzzles your thing ? Then this is the game for you	There once was a knight by the name of Daniel Fortesque , and when King Peregrin and the good-hearted people of Gallowmere were threatened by the evil sorcerer Zarok , he led the forces directly towards Zarok . It has been said that he single-handedly defeated Zarok , though mortally wounded . Unfortunately , that's not even remotely true . . . as a matter of fact , he fell by the very first arrow fired in the first charge . Now , 100 years after that battle , Zarok returns , turns the people of Gallowmere into his slaves and rises the dead from their graves to wreak havoc over the quiet little town . However , ( un ? ) fortunately for us , he also accidentally awakens Dan , and with all the other ( or should I say ' actual ' ) heroes dead ( not that the hopeful wanna-be hero is a shining example of pure vitality , himself ) , he's now our only hope . This is it , Daniel . . . you've been given a second chance to prove your worth ; don't blow it . The game has you controlling Dan , as he struggles to battle evil , save the people of Gallowmere and become a true hero ( especially in the eyes of the long dead heroes ( not all of which hold Sir Dan in equally high , or even particularly high , esteem ) , and the witty , sarcastic and utterly irreverent gargoyles ) . Now , apart from the twist of controlling a would-be hero ( rather than a typical hero returning to save the day ) , there's the added fun factor that what you're controlling isn't your everyday knight . . . he is , after all , dead . So you're running around as a skeleton wearing armor , with only one eye ( the arrow I mentioned before ? Got him right in the left eye . Ouch ) and without a jaw ( yup , that's what a century of decomposition will do to you ) . This is constantly part of the black humor ; for example , Dan can't speak clearly , since he's got no jaw ( or tongue , for that matter ) . When Dan smiles , it's really just the half row of teeth left forming what appears to be the upper part of a regular smile . Not really a pretty sight . Not at all . If you jump and Dan's head hits a surface , you'll hear a hollow sound , making it clear that his head is , indeed , empty . This may sound quite distasteful and downright disgusting to some , but I assure you , it's done in such a grotesque and direct manner , you can't help but laugh . If you're into black comedy , at least . The plot is highly original , and it moves along at a very good pace , delivering plenty of back-story ( about Dan , the other heroes , the myths and the town , etc . ) along the way . Graphics are great , you can barely tell that the game is seven years old by now . They looked good back then , and they still hold up very well . Level design is top notch , with few exceptions . One or two levels ( keeping in mind that this is out of about a dozen and a half ) just seem too easy and / or short , and you have to wonder how and why they made it into the final version of the game . One level has you fighting wave after wave of souped up enemies , dealing 5 times the damage they usually do . That just seems to scream " We've run out of ideas ! " at the top of its lungs . The control is great , very simple and easy to get into . Not too simple , but just simple enough . The humor is pure genius . The level and character design is incredibly detailed and imaginative . Throughout the game , you'll move through a graveyard , a mausoleum , a marsh , a crystal cave and even a ghost ship . You'll fight zombies , imps , demons , scarecrows and even hung men , still hanging from their gallows ( ! ) . That's what I call creativity . There are quite a few puzzles in the levels as well , and most of them are logical and fun to solve ( of course , there are a few obscure ones , as well ) . The weapons are entertaining to use , and quite a few are great fun , as well . For example , before you get any real weapons ( swords , daggers , projectile weapons and the like ) you only have . . . your arm . " Oh , " you say , " so you just hit them with your fists ? " Oh no , nothing that simple , not something that , to that extent , has been done before . Dan ( are you sitting down ? Good ) takes off one of his arms , and you can now direct him to either hit the enemies with it directly , or throw it at them , after which it will return to Sir Fortesque's other arm , a la a boomerang . Then there are longbows , which can fire flaming arrows ( which do , in fact , set the enemies ablaze . . . oh yeah ) . . . I'll leave you to discover the rest . Then there's the camera . . . this is a sensitive area for many of these games ( the linear third person console ones ) . However , Medieval succeeds in this area too ; the camera moves naturally , so that you can adjust the direction you're moving in . You can also rotate the camera yourself , if you're unsure of your surroundings ( with a few exceptions , and these are usually in areas where you don't need to rotate it ) . There's even a feature that has Dan treading carefully when he nears a hole , effectively warning the player , keeping you from falling down , as long as you don't run ( Walk , Don't Run , as the song lyric goes . . . especially if there are places to fall far down abound ) in places where you aren't sure of the terrain . The sound is superb . All high-quality sounds , fitting their purpose . The voice acting is of unusually high quality for a console game . Every voice fits and most lines work . The game-play is very entertaining , though I suppose there could be a higher rate of re-playability ( once you've beaten it , there's not really much reason to play again , unless you start over . . . save for collecting chalices for bonuses , of course , which are both entertaining and usually completely and entirely worth it to acquire for players of the game ) . I recommend this to any fan of Gothic style , black comedy , and fantasy , action and horror games .
Credibility	Ridley Scott is usually one you can depend on to make a good , sometimes fantastic , film , and it'll mostly be well-done . This definitely fits the last two mentioned qualities . The plot is impeccably well-written , and keeps developing very well throughout . The pacing is flawless , it moves fast but never overwhelms , and manages to occasionally slow down , yet always maintains enough speed to keep you interested . The characters are well-written and memorable . The acting is beyond reproach , I see not a single performance that I could complain about . Mark Strong was particularly excellent . The realism is kept immensely high , and there are almost no Hollywood moments in the entirety . The story-telling is masterful , no time is wasted whatsoever , nothing is present that is unnecessary or doesn't serve a purpose . The cinematography and editing are careful and effective . This shows the Arab culture in a neutral light at certain parts , and actually features spoken Arabic , in nice amounts , which I would say should earn it recognition ( in addition to all else I've mentioned in this review ) . I would say that this is a thriller-drama , with action elements . . . do not watch it expecting constant car-chases or shootings , albeit it is surely intense . It brings up several well-stated and solid points , for and against several sides , and offers food for thought . There is near-constant language , and it is always moderate or more . Also , there is a lot of violence and a little sheer brutality , and it is not for the faint of heart . I recommend this to any fan of the people involved in making it , not the least of whom the director , and I again state that it is not a popcorn flick .
Intense	This is the first of the Animatrix shorts , found on the DVD of them . It is arguably the most entertaining . This maintains a rather fast pace throughout the entirety , without ever becoming overwhelming . It takes place a little before , and sets up , Reloaded ( and also the Enter the Matrix ) . That doesn't mean it is a requirement to view this , however . The plot is well-written , and the story-telling is good . The CGI is stunning , incredibly naturalistic and quite close to being seamless . This was animated by the people who also made Final Fantasy : The Spirits Within , and you can tell that their talent was applied to this . The visuals are amazing all the way . The music is fitting . The sound in general is great , and the voice acting is nice . The characters are well-written , but there is little time devoted to developing them , particularly beyond the two leads . This is 9 minutes long , and the focus here was on making it feel like one of the awesome action scenes from the films ( this is definitely the one most true to that aspect of the trilogy ) . They succeed . This has strong sensuality , but not particularly anything objectionable beyond that . The disc also holds a making of , six and a half minutes , very worth watching , with the crew talking about it , clips of it , and we even get a glimpse at some of the short they created to prove they could pull this off . I recommend this to any fan of the concept and the movies .
Sublime	I've been a fan of John Carpenter for years . I've seen every movie of his that I've had a chance to watch . This is among his best work . Film can be an art-form . It is a medium that can be used to express profound thought and interesting ideas . This is one that transcends what we call film . By the end of watching , I was very short of being in awe . Carpenter has most definitely not lost his touch . He took an interesting idea and gave it near-perfect execution . The plot is interesting and intriguing . I was on the edge of my seat for the entire film . He builds atmosphere as skilfully as ever , and creates scares like few horror directors can . The movie has quite a bit of violence and gore , though Carpenter fans know to expect that ( though , as he points out in the interviews featured on the DVD , it isn't the point of the film ) . I won't detail the plot or the point of the film , I leave that up to the viewer . Once again , John deals with the supernatural ( personally , I'm not big on that , but I tolerate it , when the film is good ) , and I'll leave it at that . The actors all do very good . . . Kier is someone you can always expect to deliver a creepy performance , and Reedus is good ( though not great ) . Redman is probably the person I found to have the most effective presence . . . and I urge anyone who will watch this to not read the cast-list to see what he portrays , or at least not think too much about it . As far as rating goes , this has the earlier mentioned gore and violence , and a good bit of it , so anyone watching should be able to handle a lot of that . There was some language . There is also some nudity , for anyone who are offended by that ( I can't see anyone being attracted to it , in this . . . I certainly should hope not , considering the nature of it ) . The music in this helps convey the creepy mood that Carpenter masters creating . . . it was composed by his son , a third generation musician , making this another father / son collaboration ( another example , the only other episode of this show that I've seen , is Deer Woman , which was directed by John Landis , and written by his son , Max ) . I recommend this wholeheartedly to any fan of genuine horror , John Carpenter and film as an art-form .
Beautiful film	I knew little of the man whose name graces the title of this film before I watched it . . . I knew the name and had a vague idea of what he stood for , but that was it . Through this extensive three-hour biography , I was told what appears to be almost all of it . Gandhi was an extraordinary man . His philosophy of not fighting physically , but simply resisting , to let the oppressors of his people come to realize by themselves that they were on the wrong ( while it arguably would not have worked many other places or even at other points in time ) was truly genius . A peaceful revolution , a non-violent overthrowing of government . . . it sounds as if those sentences contradict themselves , but through this man's work , they were proved to be true . The plot is interesting , and takes off from the very beginning . The pacing varies , but is mostly good . The acting is all very strong . . . Kingsley became Gandhi . The characters are well-written , though there certainly are many of them . . . you'll need to pay close attention and concentrate to be able to remember all of them . The cinematography and editing is of high quality , though it's often kept relatively simple . The dialog is expertly written . . . when Gandhi speaks , whether simply stating his philosophies and claiming the rights of his people , or using his clever wit to expose the ignorance and unfairness of his oppressors , it's perfect . You can not argue with this man's intentions , and the effectiveness of his methods is widely renowned . Yes , he may have been stubborn , perhaps even too much for his own good . . . but his fight , his victory changed the world , and his example will remain an inspiration for years to come . I recommend this film to any fan of the people involved in making it and anyone interested in Gandhi .
Evokes strong emotion	I saw this movie with my film class . I attend a school that is kind of the stepping stone to further education , one where those who don't really know what they're going to do with their life , what they're going to be later on come to spend some time , getting guidance and being taught valuable skills . These kids ( well , teens , really ) are searching for their identity . And anyone who's been around such teens know that they have a tendency to be quite loud . . . but not this day . The film came on , the opening credits played . . . and silence . Complete and utter silence . After the film was done , most of us sat around , not knowing what to do or say . I don't think one word was uttered the rest of the day . Not one . Not because they were afraid of saying something bad or inadequate about the film . . . but because they didn't know what to say . And neither did I . It's been half a week since said day , since I watched this film . And I haven't been able to put down one word about it until today . After a quick look a my collection of reviews , you'll know that I've written quite a few . . . and most , the vast majority of them were written in an amount of time ranging from one to two hours , and I begun writing as soon as I could get to the computer after watching the film . This film really reached out and touched me . Us . It deeply touched a group of kids that many people would consider impossible to impact emotionally . I feel that describing this is the best possibly way I can explain how powerful and well-made it is . The plot is very well-written and develops nicely throughout the film . The pacing is slightly off at times , and more often than not , the movie seems far longer than it is . The acting is all top-notch , not one performance seemed weak or poor in the least . The writing is excellent . The direction is highly effective , without being manipulative . If this movie doesn't touch you or make you question some things , I doubt anything will . I recommend this to anyone who can deal with the subject matter and who aren't afraid of being deeply emotionally affected by a movie .
Near-perfect execution	As is more often than not true for my reviews of VGs , this is based on the PC version . This title is generally met with positive response . That is well-deserved . In almost every way , this is the greatest since the first , and in many , it's even better . This is incredibly smooth , every aspect of it , it's unbelievable how much effort was put into it , and how well and clearly it all has paid off . This is probably the best of the whole series . The freedom is quite simply extreme . If you think you can do it , it makes sense to do in the context of what your goals are , and you have or can obtain the means . . . you are enormously likely to be able to . This allows you to be creative with your main limitation being your own imagination . You can spend literally countless hours trying out and finding the just about infinite different methods of successfully taking out your targets , with varying degrees of secrecy . Unprecedented , at least for these . Talk about your re-playability value . Things that occurred in the others are considerably more available here . They manage to keep them from becoming flat and dull . I'd say it's because they have multiple applications , and are , honestly , darned fun to work with . Examples , you ask ? How about the possibility of making your hit look like an accident ? They do happen , you know . Barbecues malfunction . Heavy objects drop at inopportune times , for those that are under them as they do . Less attention can help a professional killer . That brings me to the notoriety . If you get seen or make yourself too noticeable . . . mass murderers tend to be . . . then you will , in fact , be tracked down . Your picture might get in the paper . Civilians can recognize you . That's gonna make a mess of your next assignment . Either you plan and sneak , eliminate them spot-on , without anyone knowing you were there , or you spend a hefty chunk of your reward . . . which also depends on your rating , the stealthier , the more . . . buying the trouble away . Furthermore , you always get to carry a tactical explosive with you . Sabotage or a crude . . . but deliciously effective , and usually untraceable . . . instrument to render members of the opposition , and that includes the ones you're specifically hired to remove , deceased . The choice is yours . You now always have a syringe of poison , and one that will sedate , and mostly two uses of each . They can taint foods , or you can go for the direct approach . This combination is good , and the next step for that . In this are intricately detailed briefings , more so than the others in the franchise , except for perhaps Codename : 47 , as well . This makes hiding easier , both for yourself and for bodies . Someone pointed out that this does get a tad obvious . . . with containers big enough to hold a corpse found in a bunch of areas . The closets for the clone himself are somewhat inconspicuous . There are negatives in this . . . they're minuscule and seldom impact the entertainment , but not entirely nonexistent . The training bit has been brought up before , too . While it does , indeed , introduce a lot of what you can do in this , leaving little of it unrevealed , it fails in setting the tone , by not only suggesting you mow down the majority of all you meet , but largely forcing you to do so . Unwise . From then on out , every mission does let you attain the coveted SA , or Silent Assassin , if you do it right . The several marks in all of them , among other things , help ensure that this offers plenty of challenge , and to all , on account of the four difficulty settings , that are rather well defined , and you get to read precisely what each has and hasn't got , prior to any second of trying it . This has a profile system . . . for every completion , you can store your progress , although you aren't required to , if , for example , you weren't happy with how well you did . Note that you can't load what you've saved if you exit , if you stop playing , you have to start that one , over . The weapons of this are nice and cool , and you have a couple that you can upgrade . . . the iconic Silverballers , the nifty Spas 12 , an M4 , a Heckler & Koch MP5 and the infamous Walther 2000 . We're talking , silencers , alternate ammo , accuracy , speed to name a few . The money for those would be another reason to go for " clean " play-throughs . You can now purchase " intel " , hints . The level design is solid . The map leaves little , if anything , to be desired , as with most else in this . The interface is magnificent . The camera is now " loose " , with 360 degrees of freedom . And without losing the solid control of 47 . You can , as the developers put it , stage the attacks , view it from the angle you want as you go into action . The cinematic style of this is excellent . The cut-scenes are amazing , and , seemingly , in spite of the LOD on them , invariably in-engine . They're part of the source of pure , unadulterated awesomeness of this . The plot is intriguing and well-told , with a climactic and satisfying twist . The graphics are immense and masterfully done . This tops as far as the realistic movement goes , and the rag-doll physics . This supports a huge group of characters at an occasion , and the NPCs always have their own life . You can watch it play out if you don't affect them . The AI is astounding . The music . . . wow . I wouldn't rule out that it's more enticing and fitting than in the other three . Jesper Kyd outdoes himself . With one exception , this takes place in the US . . . and nowhere else . That doesn't have to preclude it from having interesting and diverse locations , and it doesn't . There are some stereotypes in this , along with language , particularly in aforementioned intro , that can get harsh , and strong , at times pervasive , sexuality , albeit no nudity . I recommend this to any fan of the others , and / or open games .
I'm . . . I'm speechless	This turned out to be a truly haunting , hypnotic and gripping tale . . . how could it have eluded me for so long ? Yes , I know , I said in the one line summary that I'm speechless . . . and that is my initial reaction . . . but that would make this review awfully short , wouldn't it ? I remember seeing part of this as a kid . . . it terrified me . Now , I'm not known to have a photographic memory . If a thing doesn't make an impression on me , it can vanish from my recollection within a very short space of time . Just like that . Without a trace . That , by the way , is the name of a rather entertaining TV series . But I digress . As I re-watched this , specifically the last episode , I could recognize what I saw . Every shot , every line , it rang so clear to me , as had I watched it mere days before . . . and not over a decade . This was first aired on Danish television in 1994 , and I'm fairly certain that was when I saw a little of it . Twelve years ago . Comparatively , I saw several episodes of Kingdom Hospital , the Stephen King-authored Americanization / ripoff of this marvelous story when it aired here , about a few months ago , possibly half a year . . . and the only things I do remember are the scenes that were copied from this , which were much , much better in this version . The plot is exceptionally well-written and the way it develops is almost sublime . The pacing is near-perfect . Few times were I ever bored , almost too few to even bother mentioning , and as the show approached its end , I found myself even more on the edge of my seat , even more caught up in the intensity , even more excited to see where it would all go . The suspense becomes nail-biting to an almost physically painful level , finally reaching an incredible climax . The writing is great . It deals with some strong ethical questions , and combining horror with soap-opera-ish drama works surprisingly well . It takes the occult terror down to a level we can relate to better , through the more usual problems . The acting is all flawless . With so many big names , most of them Danish ( unusual for Trier ) and Udo Kier , Lars ' old favorite casting choice , the characters are all carried perfectly . For so many characters , I found I was rarely ever confused as to who were doing what and why . The writing for these characters is great ; the chief surgeon with his disgusted , arrogant personality , a trait men of such powerful positions surely must develop . I don't remember when filmed entertainment last involved me like this . This film gripped me tight and would not let go . In fact , I can't say for sure that it has . The grip may not be gone yet . . . and may in fact remain intact until I've seen the entirety of the second series , if not past that , as well . Such a powerful presentation . . . the imagery , the sound , the impression it has left . . . unique in its combined simplicity and effectiveness . The cinematography is great . Using what seems to be hand-held camera the majority of the time , the film's look has a restless , unnerved quality to it . With some long takes that are somewhat reminiscent of Kubrick , the eery feel and thick atmosphere is established and kept throughout . There were a few single cases where the camera-work or lighting kept the viewer from being able to see exactly what was going on , but these were so rare and minor , they don't impact the overall experience . What does , however , achieve that , and what brings my rating down from a perfect 10 . . . is the humor . Amongst the disturbing , nearly traumatizing serious occurrences , we have these breaks containing typical Danish humor , a humor I don't care too much for and which just doesn't seem to fit . It takes some away from the seriousness , and near the end it just reaches an entirely ridiculous level . It felt as though I was watching an old Danish comedy ( eh , let's face it , back then , some decades back , they were all comedies ) . Any Dane or even someone who has a fair bit of knowledge regarding Danish film history will know what I mean , especially if they've seen this otherwise spell-binding mini-series , too . Sadly , that harms the overall quality of this otherwise fine product some , but it is still more than worth your time . I don't remember when 4 hours last passed by so quickly . . . except for time spent with my wonderful , beloved fiancée , of course , which passes even faster . I recommend this to any fan of Lars von Trier , the occult , horror and masterful film-making .
Honestly , even with the flaws , this is amazing	Obviously this has been extremely hyped . And while the overall reception is positive , there are those that hate this . I have no problem with these people , and I won't claim that this is all the way perfect - one can wonder if any film could truly be - but this does have undeniably impressive aspects . This is an excellent movie , and not only for being based on graphic novels . The psychology is magnificent , and goes far beyond the one-note " fear " approach of the first . It can be argued how close it all is to the comics , however , a lot of the tone and concept comes through , and will be accessible to the majority of viewers . Is this not the most intimidating and strongest portrayal of The Joker on the big screen ( and the idea behind him is interesting ) ? Ledger ( R . I . P . ) disappeared into the performance , and one can understand why it might have affected him personally . The acting , in general , is impeccable . Bale ( in spite of having utterly and completely forgotten how to do the voice of the black-clad vigilante . . . ? ) , Caine , Freeman , Oldman all do great , again . Gyllenhaal was a good replacement for Holmes . Eckhart is spot-on . The complexity of this is admirable . The amount of plot , that one can actually still follow it all , and that it all comes together with nothing going underdeveloped or unused is astounding . The surprises work enormously well . Granted , not everything remains entirely credible . The effects are marvelous . The comedy works well , few jokes fall flat . The dialog is well-written and delivered equally well . The action is awesome , and it does not take over , the focus is still on the material and what is explored , not what gets blown up or who has a fight scene . Might I add , Nolan got better at shooting it , it never looks bad in this , and tends to be exciting and engaging . The music is well-composed , and it stays enough in the background as to not detract from the whole . There is a little moderate language , no sexuality , and quite a few disturbing sights , sounds and thoughts . The DVD has extras , including featurettes ( oddly devoid of talking heads , done more with still shots with the crew and / or Christopher talking over them ) dealing with the IMAX cameras , the score and others , photo galleries , trailers and TV-spots . I recommend this very warmly to any fan of Batman , the director and / or anyone else involved in making this .
Unique , brilliant and deep	Ever since I first heard of this film , I was intrigued and wanted to find out if it was really pulled off as well as everyone said . Incredibly enough , despite how sky-high my expectations were for this film , I was pleasantly surprised and my expectations were definitely exceeded . As you probably already know , this whole film runs ' backwards ' . . . meaning that you start by seeing the end , and then go all the way back to the beginning . There's a line in the film that perfectly states the immediate thought that just about anyone has about this idea when they first hear it : " I always thought the joy of reading a book is not knowing what happens next . " A reasonable assumption , but not always a true one . Especially not when it comes to this film . Because every single scene , up to ( but not including ) the very last one , starts with the ending of the next one , and ends with the beginning of the previous one . This makes the mystery even more elusive and adds more intensity to the thriller portions of the film . The brilliant and unique reverse time-line is perfectly explained by the main characters condition . This is the best film I've seen in quite a while , and I can't argue with its position on the top 250 ( as I'm writing this , it's # 20 ) . While some might think it's just a typical mystery-thriller with a non-linear time-line thrown in , but it's so much more than that . Like another reviewer points out , it's not what you say , but how you say it . Between every scene in the backwards moving time-line , there is one in black and white that follows a normal time-line . This is great as a break from the scenes moving towards something you already know , and makes the mystery even harder to figure out . The great thing about this film is , not only do we experience the same confusion that the main character does , but we also find out the truth , which he learns at the beginning of the story , at the end of the film . With it comes some nice observations and truths , which I'll let you discover for yourself . I won't jot down the plot here ; read a quick summary somewhere or just watch the film and find out about it . I might ruin the surprise for you , a crime greater than most . Everyone deserves to see this film and discover all of it for themselves . I will say , though , that it's brilliant . The pacing is excellent , you're never bored and you never lose interest . The acting is flawless . The characters are well-written and credible . Do yourself a favor ; know as little about this film as possible . Don't ask anyone about it , don't read about it . Just rent it and watch it , you won't regret it . I recommend this film to anyone who can appreciate fine film-making , but I suppose fans of mysteries , thrillers and / or dramas might enjoy it more than people who aren't interested in those genres . I do suggest that everyone should at least consider this film .
Excellent from start to finish	I haven't followed the hype-campaign for this , so I can't really say if it's good to watch this if you have done so or not . I was interested in this from when I first saw the teaser trailer . Yes , this does evoke images of . Yes , the entire film is presented as something that was taped on a camcorder . And yes , this camcorder does have rather impressive zooming capabilities , and a battery the durability of which is remarkable . But this is an awesome film . It's a thrill-ride , intense throughout , once it starts to be ( and I wasn't bored with what was going on before that ) . It is incredibly well-paced , it never gets to be overwhelming , but it never lets you relax all the way , either . For about an hour and a half , you will feel the sense of not really being safe . J . J . doesn't disappoint . The masterful story-telling , the marvelous concept ( which is a very interesting new angle on a very familiar type of movie / story . . . this is like The Blair Witch Project , only , you know , quality stuff ) , which was executed exceptionally well , the rich characters ( which are developed and introduced subtly and skillfully ) , the dialog ( it's " real " , clever / expertly written , or both ) . . . all the way , the traits of his productions and his talent are there ( here's hoping Lost doesn't suffer ) . The acting is flawless . I found the amount of exposure of the creature to be about perfect , I'm not sure I would have gone with neither more nor less . There's enough that you won't wonder what it looked like , and yet it's in such sparse amounts that it never loses its effectiveness , it never ceases to be scary to us . The way the film is presented is a reasonably simple idea , but the way it's used and what it does is great . I don't remember when I was last this into a movie , or had such a fun time at the cinema ( in fact , on that last one , this may be the first time for that ) . The film is perhaps not entirely without clichés , but they are quite rare , almost non-existent . It pulled the rug out from under me again and again , as J . J . has before shown a knack for being able to . The special effects are amazing , and never really feel like such . Watch this for the ride , for the well-told story within a monster flick told from an original perspective , and / or for , well , the J . J . Any fan of his may love this , if not necessarily as much as I did , and for anyone who isn't , well , this may very well have made a fan out of my dad . . . and he's usually into realistic and authentic films , more than " spectacle " ones . I recommend this to anyone who feels they would enjoy it . Keep working , J . J . , I'm definitely behind you .
