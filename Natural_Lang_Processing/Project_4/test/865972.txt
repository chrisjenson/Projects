Absolutely horrid .	I watched this piece of horse crap yesterday and I was disappointed . " Fangs " offers literally nothing new aside from a shocking similarity to another really bad horror flick " Bats " . Corbin Bernsen is completely wasted as a local businessman , the rest of the cast is also horrible . There is absolutely no gore nor suspense , so fans of horror will be disappointed . The film is bland , generic and completely anemic . Avoid this bloodless piece of crap like the plague . .
Another horribly bad slasher flick .	I've seen plenty of stupid and utterly worthless slasher flicks , but " Fatal Pulse " manages to be the worst of them all ( still I need to see " Blood Lake " and " The Last Slumber Party " ) . It's extremely routine and offers zero surprises . The plot is simple : a black-gloved killer is knocking off sorority sisters . . . The acting is awful , the gore is non-existent and the killings are lame ( the victims are strangled , electrocuted , etc . ) However one killing totally cracked me up : unlucky sorority girl has her throat slashed with a record . There is also plenty of nudity to satisfy some teenagers . Avoid this crap like the plague . . Give it a look only if you are a masochist or a rabid collector of low-budget slasher movies .
Absolute garbage .	" Lust of Frankenstein " is a worthless piece of garbage made by Jesus Franco . The incredibly old and unattractive Lina Romay plays Moira , the daughter of Dr . Frankenstein , who does not like her widowed stepmother . Anyway , Moira discovers the hibernating body of another of her dad's experiments , this time of a woman . The monster , whose name is Goddess is played by the aging Michelle Bauer . Moira falls in love with Goddess and goes on a wild sex-spree that includes killing a bunch of people . The film features tons of sleaze and nudity , but the sex scenes are absolutely unerotic and laughably unconvincing . The action is incredibly slow and there is no gore . Avoid this piece of trash like the plague-just watch again " Female Vampire " , " Barbed Wire Dolls " or Borowczyk's " The Beast " . and that's being kind .
Total garbage .	Joseph Merhi's " The Newlydeads " is a textbook example of late 80's slasher . The spirit of a dead drag queen kills honeymoon couples at the lakeside resort where he was murdered . This film is so horrendously bad that it truly has to be seen to be believed . The acting is awful , the suspense is non-existent and there is plenty of cheesy gore . The character of drunken preacher is hilarious . This is the sort of movie that keeps you thinking that they must have intended it to be bad-this couldn't be some sort of accidental mistake . Avoid this one like the plague . .
Extremely cheap and awful monster movie .	An astronaut gets infected by space spores and turns into one of the stupidest looking creatures I have ever seen . His spaceship crashes in a Florida swamp and the monster quickly begins killing people . There are some hilarious moments in this piece of utter garbage like the attack of armadillo or a worm bursting out of some idiot's neck . There is a decent amount of gore , but the film lacks any scares and features almost no nudity . The plot is bland and the final showdown with an alien is so utterly ridiculous that it defies description . I have seen plenty of awful Z-grade horror flicks in my time and " Dark Universe " is among the worst . It truly reeks . .
Extremely dull piece of trash .	" The Mummy Lives " is an utterly worthless horror film that is so bad that I almost turned it off after 20 minutes of its projection time . Usually remarkable actor Tony Curtis is completely wasted as Aziru , an Egyptian high priest of the god Zoth , who come back to life as the mummy . He is looking for his long-lost love named Kia and swearing vengeance on the archaeologists , who excavated his tomb . " The Mummy Lives " is a total waste of time . The plot is hackneyed and highly unoriginal and the acting is painfully bad . This is also one of the most annoyingly dull horror films I have suffered through . The action moves at snail's pace and there is absolutely no tension . Avoid this crappy howler like the plague . .
Pure crap .	Bill Rebane's " The Capture of Bigfoot " is one of the most awful horror movies ever made . A greedy sawmill owner Harvey Olsen ( Richard Kennedy ) decides that he wants Bigfoot captured at all costs . However local game ranger Dave Garrett ( Stafford Morgan ) learns that the Bigfoot used to live in peace upset by a geological expedition , and sets out to protect the creature . There is nothing even remotely interesting in this piece of crap . The film is extremely dull and filled with horrible songs and cheap special effects . No gore , no suspense-just gigantic boredom . Avoid this horrible junk like the plague .
Urban Legends : Final Crap .	At Alpine University , a group of film students are competing for the Hitchcock Award , a prestigious contest that would virtually guarantee anyone's career in Hollywood . Inspired by some stories from the campus security guard , Amy decides to create a film about urban legends-scary tales passed from person to person that everyone has heard . But soon after her movie starts filming , mysterious murders based on those very legends begin to plague the campus , and it's up to Amy and her friends to uncover the killer before it's too late . " Urban Legends : Final Cut " is another horrible teen slasher flick aimed at the younger audience . It's completely unoriginal and predictable . There are just long stretches of useless filler dialogue , interrupted by murders , shown in abstract , lackluster ways-two of them are shown through the eyes of cameras and two take place off-screen . The unmasking of the killer is a total let down and her / his motive is painfully stupid . There is a bit of gore and some stalk and slash sequences are mildly effective , unfortunately " Urban Legends : Final Cut " is a big steaming pile of dung . Avoid it like the plague . My generous rating : .
Extremely boring .	A murderer is on the loose and the citizens of San Francisco are frightened . As the police become baffled by the case , the city's only hope is an unconventional sleuth played by Garry Goodrow . Like the other reviewer said this film is a huge disappointment . It lacks scares and gore and is really boring . Avoid this one at all costs !
Something is wrong with this movie-surely it is .	This movie is not as good as I hoped it would be . In fact , it is really lame . There are no actually scary parts , a lot of slow , boring scenes . The cast is awful , these people simply can't act at all ( with the possible exception of Joe Mantegna ) , even no gore to satisfy gore-hounds ( just a little bit ) . Director Tom Holland ( " Child's Play " ) fails to create any atmosphere . The film is dull , the first fifty minutes is pure crap , where almost nothing happens . The climax is pretty good and interesting though . Some time ago I saw " Night Flier " and that adaptation of Stephen King's story looks like a masterpiece in comparison to this trash . All in all I was bitterly disappointed with this one . I'm fairly concerned that " Thinner " is another mainstream horror garbage without any scares or invention . Don't waste your time unless you are a die-hard Stephen King's fan . Not recommended .
Total garbage .	Sergio Garrone's " SS Experiment Camp " is a total failure on every possible level . This film was banned in Britain as a video nasty , but it surely isn't as outrageous as many people claim . In fact it's pretty tame even by today's standards . There is some torture and humiliation and lots of nudity and soft-core sex . Some scenes are pretty mean-spirited for example one woman who refuses to go through the experiments is put into the tank . The temperature is first put up to almost boiling point and then the dial is turned the other way making it icy cold . Still the film is extremely dull , so fans of Italian exploitation may be disappointed . Avoid this one like the plague-watch " Beast in Heat " or " Gestapo's Last Orgy " instead !
Typical mainstream horror garbage .	First of all I don't like these new horror flicks from Hollywood . The difference with some of the 80's horror flicks and todays horror product is political correctness and MTV style trends . These films ( like " Scream " , " Urban Legend " or upcoming " Valentine " ) are trying to please teeny boppers more than horror fans . " Dracula 2000 " directed by Patrick Lussier and produced by Wes Craven is another lame horror flick . Of course it has several flaws : too many jump scares , not enough pure suspense , some rather silly lines etc . However the acting is mediocre ( Gerald Butler as a Dracula is quite laughable ) , the story is fast-paced , albeit rather silly and the film is also quite gory ( with decapitations , stabbings and some other scenes of mayhem ) . Avoid this one like the plague-watch " Vampyres " or " Near Dark " instead . .
Not worthy of " Man Behind the Sun " title .	Unit 731 has to shut down its base in Manchuria and all evidence that it existed must be destroyed . During the shut down , a soldier gets infected with some plague and ends up riding a train back home and somehow this means there is a " biological time bomb , aimed at the heart of the Japanese empire " . The first " Man Behind the Sun " is incredibly disturbing and devastating film , on the other hand " Laboratory of the Devil " is just a rip-off of the original with some scenes of shocking violence added for good measure . " Narrow Escape " mostly takes place on a train . The film is loaded with flashbacks of graphic experiments from the previous installments and offers literally nothing fresh or interesting . Unfortunately they didn't replay the scene of the guy having his innards squeezed out of him inside the pressure chamber . So if you want to watch this one for sickening violence and gore you'll be sorely disappointed . Watch only " Man Behind the Sun " and " The Nanking Massacre " - don't bother with Godfrey Ho's uninteresting rip-offs .
Beautifully made snooze-fest .	Mike Newell's " The Awakening " is the third version of Bram Stoker's " The Jewel of Seven Stars " . The other two are " Blood from the Mummy's Tomb " ( 1971 ) and " Legend of the Mummy " ( 1997 ) . The film was obviously inspired by " The Omen " ( 1976 ) . The photography is stunningly beautiful , the real Egyptian locations are simply breathtaking and there are some gruesome death scenes-my favourite includes Susannah York thrown out of a window and then a shard of glass dropped on her neck . There is a bit of suspense , but-as the people rightly pointed it out-the action is painfully slow , so " The Awakening " quickly becomes incredibly dull . So if you have enough time to waste give this one a look . You have been warned .
Hilarious trash loaded with cheesy gore .	A bloodthirsty and sadistic Romanian warrior named Nikos is inadvertently brought back to life during a pish-posh art gallery opening in New York . He butchers a lot of stupid people , then the carnage spills onto the streets of New York eventually taking us to a lesbian bar , a movie theater and a video store . " Nikos " is a trashy horror flick loaded with tons of gore and awful acting . The body count is very high , though . The characters are poorly developed , but certainly the film delivers the grue . Heads are chopped and squished , breasts are torn off , the guts are spilled and the body parts are cut . The gore is pretty extreme and there is a lot of familiar faces including Felissa Rose , Lloyd Kaufman and Debbie Rochon . Overall , " Nikos " is a lot better than dull " Demonium " , but still I'd like to recommend it only for die-hard fans of German gore . .
Obscure horror from South Africa .	The title of this film is very misleading , because there are no zombies here . This South African horror deals with science and magic . The script is actually decent , but the film is really boring and dull , and there's no gore at all . To be fair , there are two or three suspenseful scenes , and the ending is quite exciting-this is enough for me to classify " House of the Living Dead " as a decent horror film , so I'll give it .
Politically correct " Cannibal Holocaust " knock-off .	" Welcome to the Jungle " tells the story of four spoiled and obnoxious Americans who set out into the jungles of New Guinea armed with a few digital cameras to find the missing Michael Rockefeller and make themselves rich by getting an exclusive interview with him . Of course they are captured and killed by the tribe of savages . I must admit that the story is fairly convincing and the location sets provide some spooky atmosphere , but the characters are dumb and annoying . I really wanted them to suffer painful death just not to listen their constant whining . Almost complete lack of gore and nudity is very disappointing . While Jonathan Hensleigh has denied that his film has anything to do with Ruggero Deodato's infamous " Cannibal Holocaust " the similarities are obvious ( check out the girl impaled on bamboo stick ) . There are a couple of moments where the graphic special effects are actually done quite well , but the inane dialogue and my general hatred for half the cast reduced my enjoyment . Better watch " Cannibal Holocaust " , " Eaten Alive " or " Jungle Holocaust " again .
Cheesy and gory .	Don Dohler's " Nightbeast " tells us the story about an alien-like beast which is killing people in a small American town . It is a poorly made film with cheap special effects , but still it is enjoyable enough to keep most of the horror fans entertained . The acting is awful , the script is not better , but there's plenty of cheesy gore ( like entrails ripping , decapitation etc . ) to satisfy undemanding gore hounds . The sex scene between the sheriff and his deputy is a laugh riot ! - check it out if you like low budget horror movies .
Incopetent nonsense with well-known cast .	Kathy Collins is no ordinary eight year old girl . Indeed , she is unique , carrying within her the power of Sateen , an inter-spacial force of immense magnitude . Katy's primary mission on Earth is to carry these genes forward , a task accomplished by convincing her mother Barbara to bear a similarly endowed male child with whom Kathy would eventually mate . " The Visitor " makes no sense . It plays like insane mix of such occult films as " Rosemary's Baby " , " The Exorcist " and " The Omen " but also a tribute to such sci-fi classics as " Close Encounters of the Third Kind " . There are so many disconnected plot elements for example aliens wandering through the desert , giant green clouds billowing up from nowhere or the sky turning the color of blood , but the action is fast paced and some surreal images are quite psychedelic . .
A disappointment !	This anthology , featuring a pair of hour-long Poe adaptations by two famous horror directors is a mixed bag . The first story - " The Black Cat " by Dario Argento ( " Suspiria " , " Tenebre " ) is pretty tense . Harvey Keitel is excellent as a crazed photographer , and Tom Savini's gore effects are suitably nasty ( gotta love meat-cleaver scene ! ) . The second story - " The Facts in the Case of Mr . Valdemar " is a tedious bore . There's no suspense , almost no gore-this story is yet another sad sign of Romero's declining ability . I guess it's only worth watching for Adrienne Barbeau and horror veteran Tom Atkins . All in all " Two Evil Eyes " is a disappointment for me , but if you love horror movies you can try it .
Good stuff !	" The Night Porter " really isn't as shocking as his reputation suggests , but still there is a good amount of sleaze featured here . I've heard that the main source of inspiration for Liliana Cavani was her interview with a real concentration camp survivor who was forced into a sadistic relationship with one of her captors . Dirk Bogarde is excellent as a Max , a former SS officer ! The film is well-made and a little bit disturbing-I'm fairly sure that it influenced an infamous " Ilsa-She Wolf of the SS " . Check it out , but be prepared for some rather unpleasant stuff !
Unnecessary remake of Spanish horror hit " Rec " .	Angela joins firemen Jake and other fire-fighting heroes on a disturbance call to an old apartment building . Tenants were spooked due to an old lady's scream . Upon further investigation the old lady tenant viciously attacks on the of the police officers already on the scene and when the people try to leave the building it appears they've been locked in . Blocked from escape with other infected people around a vet who lives in the building is able to figure out that the disease that's been plaguing the tenants is a new , advanced form of rabies that manifests in humans in minutes and is totally incurable . First of all I loved " Rec " - it was eerie and has some realistic scenes of terror and paranoia . " Quarantine " is almost a carbon copy of Spanish horror hit with only a few new things added . That's why it didn't kept me on the edge of my seat . Because I have seen the original I could almost predict everything . Jennifer Carpenter is also more hysterical than Manuela Velasco and the building from " Quarantine " is nowhere near as creepy as that from " Rec " . Still if I haven't seen the original before I'd give this film much more positive review . and that's being kind .
Interesting concept , yet mediocre execution .	Steve and Rachel move from New York to a small town . Steve runs a movie rental store and noticed the people in the town are obsessed with violent slasher flicks . One day someone accidentally returns a video of a real life murder . Can it be real or is someone just playing a joke on the towns new residents . They will soon find out and the blood will be shed . It seems that the entire town is involved with psychotic serial killers Howard and Eli in a craven conspiracy to create and distribute their own snuff films . When I was a kid I loved renting tons of gory horror from various rental palaces . Horror is still my life and I'm damn proud of it . " Video Violence " is loaded with cheesy gore , crappy acting and nudity . It brings sweet memories of my gore-soaked childhood . .
Okay low-budget creature / horror flick .	Dr . Amanda Hollins , a molecular biologist who , in distress and ill health requests her son John to destroy all the lab notes from her last genetic experiment . She also blurts out that he had a brother named Anthony . From her natural son's living tissue , Amanda has created a half-human monster that sits dormant in her basement . Unfortunately for John and his friends Anthony has come to life as an oozing , tentacled and slime-covered monster , ready to taste human blood . . . " The Kindred " is a seriously underrated little horror flick . The creature effects are pretty good , the acting is fine and there is a little bit of gore . The action is fast-paced and the film manages to be both entertaining and gruesome . All in all , " The Kindred " provides a few chills plus a few intense moments . Give this obscure little gem a look . .
Solid horror flick based on Greek myth of Charon .	Three couples embark on a six day romantic boat journey to Fiji and their differences ensure that personality clashes abound . However all that is put to one side when they encounter a seemingly abandoned boat in dense fog . They find a living stranger on board and rescue him , however the terrifying consequences lead to plenty of gore . It seems that the ship is deserted apart from the mysterious sailor lying half-dead under a tarpaulin ( played by horror regular John Rhys Davies ) . Rhys-Davies ' body is actually home to a being who can shift between bodies swapping souls . This soul-swapping is achieved with the aid of the magic dagger-if he stabs somebody with it , he instantly becomes the victim . He's doing this to avoid a demonic entity called ' the Ferryman ' who has been chasing him through thousands of bodies over many years . In " The Ferryman " each victim in turn becomes the killer . The killer always has a snakelike tattoo on their back , which is the symbol of infinity . During the first 40 minutes the action moves slowly and the legend of Ferryman is slightly confusing . Still I enjoyed this quite exciting , gripping and bloody horror flick . .
Occasionally effective Italian sleaze .	Two brothers searching in Transylvania for the legendary ' Ring of Nibelungen ' fall under the spell of the sexy and evil Countess De Vries ( Rosalba Neri ) who uses the ring to attract the local virgins to her foreboding castle where they fall victim to her bloody rituals . This soft core piece of Italian erotica offers plenty of sleaze and nudity . Rosalba Neri is the convincing bloodsucker that spends much of the film in an advanced state of undress . In one memorable scene the Countess writhes around in a coffin in the pink while the faithful maid slowly pours a pitcher of fresh virgin blood over her naked body . Unfortunately the action is quite dull and there is almost no suspense . Still if you like lesbian vampire movies you can give it a look . .
Bloody violent bloodbath .	This is the story of a low budget film crew , led by their blind film director , Larry Benjamin ( Lloyd Kaufman / co-founder of Troma Inc . ) , trying to make some art . In addition to the typical trials and travails of a Troma set , the crew finds themselves set upon by a sexually conflicted , bomb bearing serial killer . Production assistant Jennifer ( enchanting Alyce LaTourelle ) struggles to succeed on set and to decide between the two men in her life-straitlaced Casey ( Will Keenan ) and over the edge Jerry ( Trent Haaga ) . This threesome heats up as the killer draws even nearer . As the insanity increases and the bodies pile up , the crew bands together ( both physically and sexually ) against the threat in their midst . " Terror Firmer " is an occasionally amusing and extremely gross horror comedy . Of course people don't watch Troma flicks for production values or artistic pretensions , they just want gore , nudity and crude humour . " Terror Firmer " is based on Kaufman's autobiography " All I Need to Know About Film-making I Learned from the Toxic Avenger " . The film is really disgusting , with several way over-the-top scenes of vomiting , dismemberment and crap-eating . Still I liked it and you should too if you are a fan of Troma's crazy horror films . .
Cheesy , but enjoyable horror movie from Amicus .	I simply admire those 60's and early 70's English horror movies from Amicus . They're so charming and fun to watch ( albeit sometimes goofy ) that I really appreciate this kind of entertainment . Christopher Lee is excellent as usual and the rest of the cast is also splendid . The film contains five rather weird stories . The best one-The Disembodied Hand involves an art critic , who is terrorized by a severed hand . By today's standards " Doctor Terror's House of Horrors " isn't very scary or violent , but it features some really creepy scenes . All in all this is simply a must-see for fans of the English horror . My rating : .
A psychedelic exploitation .	A doctor and a young lady ( beautiful Rita Calderoni ) have just been involved in a car accident . The doctor leaves the girl at the accident scene , and runs off to a spooky castle for help . He enters the castle , and finds that it's inhabited by some laughing ghoul ( most likely Satan himself ) . Later , the young lady goes looking for the doctor , and eventually finds her way to the same castle . However when they meet again , they find that they haven't met each other , they have meet their doppelgangers . Luigi Batzella's " Nude for Satan " is a great piece of sleazy trash . The special effects are jaw-droppingly awful ( a monster spider especially comes to my mind ! ) and the dialogue is horrid . Still there is plenty of nudity to satisfy fans of Italian sleaze . Rita Calderoni is naked pretty often and her lesbian scenes are suitably sensual . A must-see for fans of Italian sleaze / horror !
Another very graphic Category III flick .	Kang is a cruel criminal . When he was young , his parents detested him and slapped him when he tried to help or be nice . His girlfriend is violently gang-raped by two foreigners and this is the beginning of Kang's madness . Soon he sadistically rapes foreign women , violates her with a piece of wood , bites off her nipple and finally kills her . . . " Suburb Murder " is one hell of an offensive film . There are three vicious gang-rape scenes in this sleazy flick as well as plenty of sex and full-frontal nudity . The opening scene is brief but very gory , as is the closing scene which leads up to it . Unfortunately the direction is amateurish and the acting is pretty awful , however if you are a fan of morally dubious HK Category III cinema give this sickie a try . . Enjoy this depraved spectacle of rape and sexual violence .
Great slasher film .	" Bloody Moon " is a great slasher film from the master of exploitation Jesus Franco . The plot is obviously inspired by " Halloween " and " Friday the 13th " . The acting is pretty average , but there is plenty of gore to satisfy fans of splatter . There is for example very bloody power saw decapitation plus some other killings which involve chainsaws , razorblades and knives . The music score is pretty appalling and the film's theme tune is incredibly annoying . Overall , the film is moderately entertaining , so if you're a Franco fan give this one a look . Here is the plot : " Bloody Moon " takes place in a Spanish language school , where pretty female students are murdered by an unidentified stalker in a variety of grisly ways .
Another average S & M pinku .	" Madame De Sade : She Beast in Hell " certainly differs from many pinku eiga flicks I had an opportunity to see . Like my friend EVOL666 mentioned in his review this one shows a male bound and subjected to sexual torture , abuse and domination . The film is very sleazy , albeit the optical censoring of genitalia really got on my nerves sometimes . Still it's not as grim and nihilistic as let's say " Captured for Sex 2 " or " Assault ! Jack the Ripper " . Fans of Japenese exploitation expecting tons of sexual sadism will certainly be disappointed . However the sex is plentiful and there is truly titillating masturbation scene with a table leg . Unfortunately I was bored several times-I think that the film should be shorter . The typical projection time reserved for pinku eiga ( 66-68 minutes ) would be more appropriate . .
Satanic porno horror from Zebedy Colt .	" The Devil Inside Her " is set in England in 1826 . Faith loves the gardener Joseph , but her father forbids it . Faith's sister Hope lusts after Joseph and sells her souls to the Devil to get Jospeh for herself . Zebedy Colt was the director of several truly depraved porno roughies including " Sex Wish " and " Unwilling Lovers " . " The Devil Inside Her " is also a pretty twisted film with rather interesting plot . Still the hard core sex scenes in this one are slightly disappointing-they are very short and sometimes unerotic . Still there is plenty of vaginal sex with blow jobs , both female and male masturbation , lesbianism and sexual orgies . The location sets are great as they add to the overall mood of the film . So if you enjoyed " Sex Wish " or Alex De Renzy's " Femmes de Sade " you may give this porno horror a try . .
Truly sickening in some scenes !	" Faccia di Spia " is kind of a mondo movie . It is a propaganda film I think ( I have it in Italian , so the plot wasn't fully understandable to me ) and re-creates certain political events . The first hour is pretty tame , but after it the film suddenly crosses into sicko territory-it features some of the most shocking and cruel torture scenes I have ever seen ! There's a brutal rape , a metal pin inserted into a guys penis and heated , eels shoved graphically into woman's vagina , arms hacked off with an axe and eyes gouged out . Apart from such sickening scenes the film is well-made and interesting . Recommended only for fans of extreme mondo movies .
A nice piece of sleazy erotica from Jesus Franco .	Lina Romay plays Countess Irina Karlstein , who is the last in the line of the vampires . She sucks the life force from her victims during sex . The film opens with wonderfully erotic sequence in which Irina wanders out of the early morning mist , clad only in a belt , knee-high boots and cape . " Female Vampire " is very slow-moving , but it offers plenty of nudity , sex and lesbianism . Franco clearly takes a voyeuristic delight in Romay's body and activities . There is no horror whatsoever , but if you like Jesus Franco's movies give this one a look . I still think that there are far better movies made by Franco , for example " Faceless " , " Bloody Moon " , " Barbed Wire Dolls " or " Women in Cellblock 9 " . My rating : .
Amateurish and full of flaws , yet surprisingly morbid .	Two twin brothers are off to spend the summer at the farm owned by their Aunt Lacy , who enjoys incest . Also staying at the farm is Lacy's helper named Jeremy . Despite being obvious , the twins seem oblivious to the fact that Jeremy is their cousin . This obviously disturbed kid enjoys butchering men and using their various body parts including severed heads to masturbate . " Splatter Farm " is a zero-budget film . The acting is hideous apart from the actor who played Jeremy . However the gore effects are nasty and surprisingly accomplished , the atmosphere reeks of decay and few taboos are broken including necrophilia , child murder , coprophillia , animal butchery and incest . I'm not a fan of later Polonia Brothers juvenile low-budget atrocities , but I kind of enjoyed " Splatter Farm " .
Sleazy and atmospheric French horror flick ,	Hyped as The First French Sex-Horror Film " The Blood Rose " certainly delivers the goods . Lemaire plays an aging painter whose wedded bliss to gorgeous Anne turns to tragedy , when she nearly gets in a catfight with his former lover and falls into a fire in a pretty hilarious scene . She is of course horribly scarred . The great Howard Vernon plays a surgeon who may be able to return her to her former beauty , but he'll need a live victim to do it . So women are brought to the artist's château in order to get a face . The dwarfs , who were the painter's longtime servants , are charged with capturing the girls . Clearly inspired by Franju " Eyes Without the Face " " The Blood Rose " features lovely Gothic setting of French medieval castle , great-looking women and a healthy dose of sleaze . Rollin-esquire atmosphere is well-captured and the climax is fantastic . .
Strange and often unsettling .	" Strange Circus " starts out as the story of 12-year-old Mitsuko , who's being sexually abused by her father Gozo and terrorized by her jealous mother Sayuri . Mitsuko is imprisoned in a cello case and forced to watch her parents ' intimate liaisons through a peephole . The strange abuse causes Mitsuko to blur the distinction between her mother's pleasure and her own pain . When her mom dies after falling down the stairs , Mitsuko starts believing she is her mother . Sion Sono's return to ero-guro tradition is very stylish and sexually perverse . This strange film even offers lashings of paedophilia on display , fortunately they are not graphic . The carnival atmosphere of circus is well-developed and there is a nice amount of grue . Fans of more dream-like transgressive cinema should give it a look .
Surprisingly decent zombie gore comedy .	Helena and her boyfriend Martin are driving through Leitrim county in rural Ireland when they hit a man on the road . They place the body in the car to take him with them only for the body to come back to life and bite Martin in the neck . Helena runs to a farmhouse to get help , only to be attacked by zombies that close in all around , which include the now dead Martin . The local gravedigger Desmond comes to her aid . They flee through the countryside , joined by various others , avoiding zombies that appear everywhere . It appears that the outbreak has been caused by humans eating meat infected with Mad Cow Disease . " Dead Meat " is very gory and I applaud it for that . The acting is surprisingly professional and the climax is surprisingly downbeat in the vein of Romero's " The Crazies " . Check it out .
Pretty good horror film from the Godfather of Gore .	Psychic medium Professor Robert Miles is paid a visit by a young photographer named Jill Travers whom wishes to return a piece of the professor's equipment she has found in an underground tomb . Miles wastes no time in attempting to hypnotize the woman , but is interrupted by the pestering cat as it inflicts deep scratches into the man's hand . Jill responds with a hurried exit , and soon after meets Inspector Gorley who employs her as a crime-scene photographer in the investigation of a rash of fatal accidents that have recently befallen the sleepy village . She discovers cat-like scratches on one of the hand of one of the victims , and soon learns that a black cat has been present during all of the incidents . Curiosity leads the photographer back to Miles ' estate , where she learns the history of the old man's estranged relationship with the black cat . " The Black Cat " by Lucio Fulci is an atmospheric horror film that works despite its relative absence of graphic gore . The cast is pretty familiar for fans of Eurohorror including David Warbeck , Patrick Magee , Mimsy Farmer , Dagmar Lassander , Al Cliver and Daniela Doria to boost . The English setting provides plenty of creepy atmosphere and the photography by Sergio Salvati is excellent . Give it a look , if you are a fan of Lucio Fulci . .
Decent slasher thriller about murderous sheriff .	Four teenage girlfriends drive to Fort Laurdale for spring break . Unfortunately they get a flat tire in Medley , Georgia and one of the girls witnesses a brutal murder deep in the woods . The local sheriff is behind the crime and the nightmare begins . . . " Shallow Grave " is a pleasant low-budget surprise . The cast is likable enough , the direction is steady and the violence is particularly nasty and misogynistic . Especially the second murder is pretty grim . The murderous sheriff isn't one-dimensional character-in a couple of scenes it seems that he feels remorse for what he's done . The subplot involving the two boys they meet in the diner goes nowhere , but the stalking scenes in the woods are tense and exciting . .
Grotesque and nightmarish short .	This is a bonus short film on Mondo Macabro's " Girl Slaves of Morgana Le Fay " DVD . 20-year-old Catherine is hired as caretaker by a kindly old couple . The girl is gassed and murdered during her first night of stay . The film debut of Bruno Gantillon is well-acted and executed . The twist ending is surprising and very memorable . The film has some clever cinematic touches like the nightmarish hallucination sequence wherein the grotesque masks of her hosts leer over Catherine as the drug first takes effect . This particular moment of insanity reminded me some well-known horror movies made by Roman Polanski . I enjoyed " Girl Slaves of Morgana Le Fay " more , but this one is also worth checking out .
Sleazy and misogynistic .	Schlockmeisters Roberta and Michael Findlay top their other excursions into depravity with this rather unsettling horror flick . Again it features Michael Findlay murdering nude women in a variety of grisly ways . " The Kiss of Her Flesh " is a surprisingly effective and fast-paced piece of sleaze . With its creative murder weapons-tire iron , lobster claw , electrical earring wiring , blowtorch and poisoned sperm - " The Kiss of Her Flesh " has more in common with such later slasher films as Tony Maylam's " The Burning " than with the usual 60's nudie-roughie . " Flesh Trilogy " was also the first slasher series , featuring the eye-patch-wearing psycho returning to wreak more havoc on scantily-clad women . " The Kiss of Her Flesh " is definitely the most depraved of the series . It is loaded with pretty explicit nudity , sometimes full-frontal and there is plenty of lesbian sex on display . The acting is stiff and the gore is amateurish , however the air of misogyny is simply overwhelming . A must-see for any self-respecting fan of sleaze !
Unsatisfying Jean Rollin's thriller .	" Night of the Hunted " stars French porn star Brigitte Lahaie . In fact , many of the cast members in this slow-moving production were porn actors at the time of its frantic filming . This film is certainly different than Rollin's usual lesbian vampire flicks , but it's not as memorable as for example " Lips of Blood " or " Fascination " . Lahaie plays an amnesiac hitchhiker who can't remember who she is or where she came from . Most of the film takes place in a modern apartment complex , where Lahaie is being held by some kind of medical group that's treating a number of people with a similar condition . Anyway , she escapes from the monolithic office tower where the affected people are held . On a highway outside of town , she meets a young man , who stops and picks her up . " Night of the Hunted " offers plenty of nudity , unfortunately the pace is extremely slow . The atmosphere is horribly sad and the relationship between Brigitte Lahaie and another asylum inmate Dominique Journet is well-developed . Still " Night of the Hunted " is too dull to be completely enjoyable . Give it a look only if you are a fan of Jean Rollin's works . and that's being kind .
Slasher on wheels .	Stuntman Mike played by always reliable Kurt Russel gets his kicks by stalking groups of foxy chicks and ending their lives at speed with his ' death proofed ' vintage automobile . Cut to 14 months later , a different state , a different set of targets and an altogether different approach . This time round the girls are tough and fiercely independent . Unfortunately this second segment is more anemic than the first one . However the last twenty minutes are worth checking out for the fans of tire squealing and burnt rubber . The final car chase is simply incredible and adrenaline filled . In the prolonged chase sequence through deserted roads Tarantino expertly captures the raw cinema of the 70s . " Planet Terror " is more fast-paced and a lot more gorier , but who cares . " Death Proof " will bring the smile on the face of any self-respecting road movie enthusiast .
Cannibal feast in a mental hospital .	After his mother died our hero Jack was forced to have his sister Lilly committed to asylum because she began to struggle with suicidal thoughts and became a danger to herself . In order to get close to Lilly , Jack fakes insanity to get committed to the same asylum . Doctor Gianetti , who runs mental ward , created a new drug called Orpheum which turns crazies into cannibalistic killers with the urge to butchery . The plot of " Insanitarium " is routine and silly with tons of corny one-liners , but this has to be one of the goriest horror films I have seen during last few months . The acting is pretty decent and the blood flows in spades with severed limbs , impalements and decapitations painting the screen red . Overall , " Insanitarium " has enough goods to recommend it for fans of blood-drenched horror .
Pretty good Italian horror .	The story of " Beyond the Door " takes place in San Francisco in the quiet suburban home of Jessica Barret ( Juliet Mills ) and her family . Unfortunately Jessica is impregnated and possessed by a demon and she turns into a raging , demonical beast . " Beyond the Door " is usually trashed by horror fans and I really don't understand why . Of course it rips off " The Exorcist " and " Rosemary's Baby " , but Italians loved to imitate American classics . The film certainly offers some unsettling and rather creepy moments . I loved the scene where an eye turns up in a whisky glass and , when it's thrown away , the camera takes on the point of the view of the eyeball . There is no gore , so fans of Italian splatter will be disappointed . Overall " Beyond the Door " is not as fun as incredibly sleazy " Malabimba " or rather disgusting " L'Anticristo " , but if you're a fan of Italian horror give it a look . .
A grindhouse trash classic .	This bloody bizarre horror-comedy was made with zero budget and a lot of imagination . " Basket Case " is definitely not for the squeamish or those who insist on professional production values , however it quickly became a cult classic due to its odd plot , outrageous gore and unusual take on sibling rivalry . The monster siamese twin Belial is oddly lovable ( until an appalling , quite nasty rape scene ) and young Kevin Van Hentenryck makes an appealing lead . The gore effects are crude , however the film features one of the most memorable 80's creatures-the toothy blob named Belial . Overall , " Basket Case " is still a delightfully unwholesome yarn , aptly dedicated in the end credits to gore-godfather Herschell Gordon Lewis . Followed in 1990 and 1992 by a pair of inferior sequels .
Dark and creepy .	A woman pulls an unspeakable fetus out of the bowels of her kitchen sink . In the tub of warm water the fetus starts to grow until he is the size of a full grown man . Suitably creepy and weird horror short . The monochromatic cinematography is stunning and the score by cult Kiwi band The Headless Chickens adds a lot to the atmosphere . The use of sounds is exceptional as the film is almost dialogue free . It's certainly a study of suburban loneliness and neurosis with the creepy feel of David Lynch's " Eraserhead " . It won Best Short Film in the NZ Film & Television Awards and Audience Award at the Sydney film Festival in 1989 and is currently available on " Crush " DVD .
Great werewolf movie .	Wheelchair-bound teenager Cory Haim , his sister and his alcoholic uncle ( Gary Busey ) uncover a werewolf who has terrorized a small New England town of Tarker Mills for years . One night a drunken railroad engineer looses his head and the town think he just fell asleep on the tracks , until more murders begin to happen , each one more gruesome than the next . Soon the townsfolk believe its some maniac killer on the loose and intend to hunt the man down . Marty Coslaw , a young wheelchair bound boy , believes that the killer is no man at all , but a werewolf . . . " Silver Bullet " is an adaptation of Stephen King's short story . The film itself is quite enjoyable and has a special place in my heart , mainly because I saw it for the first time when I was a kid . The story is gripping and surprisingly atmospheric and there are some gory deaths . The acting is fine and the action is never dull . Overall , if you haven't seen this one yet give it a try . Fans of werewolf horror movies won't be disappointed . .
Pretty eerie mental asylum horror flick .	Clark ( Joshua Leonard pf " The Blair Witch Project " fame ) is a young and idealistic new intern at a run-down and out-dated mental health facility . His aspirations for cleaning the place hit a snag when he butts heads with Dr . Franks ( Lance Henrikson ) who seems to not mind that the patients never seem to get any better . Shortly Clark begins seeing things and death and mayhem invade the reality of the " Madhouse " . Together Clark and Sara must uncover who or what it is that stalks the asylum and survive the massacre . " Madhouse " is a nicely woven tale that offers some creepy moments and few gore scenes . The boy ghost who continues to pop up is sure to raise the hairs on your arm as will the scene at the end when we learn the truth of the patient in that room in the basement . Overall , " Madhouse " is a truly worthy addition to any genre fan's collection of twisted horror movies .
Very entertaining Japanese zombie film .	After a robbery , a group of thieves meets up with the Yakuza at an old abandoned factory in order to exchange money and jewels . However unknown to them the factory was an old military facility which was working on reanimating the dead . And they succeeded , meaning the factory is loaded with bloodthirsty zombies . " Junk " is slowly getting a minor cult following , because it has creepy , old-style zombies that are a combination of Romero / Fulci / O'Bannon's zombies . The gore is plentiful and the feel of the film is very reminiscent of the Italian gut-munchers of the late 1970 / early 1980 period . The film doesn't take itself too seriously and is pretty silly at times . There is plenty of gory mayhem on display-lots of headshots , zombies biting parts of their victims and eating intestines etc . " Junk " is extremely entertaining , so fans of Japanese horror or zombie cinema won't be disappointed .
A slow-moving and eerie French ' zombie ' film .	Chased from her train by a bloodthirsty madman sporting a face of decaying flesh young Élisabeth flees into the desolate and bleak French countryside . Unbeknownst to our heroine an experimental pesticide has tainted the region's grape harvest and all imbibers of the local vintage have been viciously mutated into deranged zombie-like killers . It's hard to classify " The Grapes of Death " as a zombie film , mainly because it features living people driven into murderous rage by contaminated wine . As the most of Jean Rollin's works " The Grapes of Death " is set in an eerily isolated and lifeless landscape loaded with empty fields , misty bridges and crumbling houses . There is a good deal of gore including particularly gruesome decapitation and lovely full-frontal nudity scene provided by Brigitte Lahaie . .
Truly surreal and grotesque film .	Guy Maddin is a truly unusual filmmaker . His movies are black comedic and supremely bizarre excursions into silent black-and-white cinema . " Tales from the Gimli Hospital " is possibly his most famous and creepiest work to date . This is a wonderfully strange and puzzling movie filled with haunting and disturbing imagery . The action takes place in the small fishing town of Gimli , Manitoba , in some indeterminate time in the early part of the 20th Century . Einar and Gunnar , two men afflicted with the deadly smallpox virus , are housed in the small Gimli Hospital , their bodies covered with the scars of disease , their minds slowly slipping into paranoia and fear . Much of the film is silent , only archaic soundtrack is used regularly . The film is shot in equisite black-and-white and looks terrific . Give it a look , if you enjoy watching surrealist cinema . .
Pretty nasty and grim Cat III shocker .	" Diary of a Serial Killer " by Otto Chan is based on actual events that took place in Guangzhao's , Wong Po village in 1991-1996 . During five years of terror Li Wenxian raped and murdered thirteen women , mostly prostitutes . Li told authorities he was seeking revenge for a prostitute who cheated him . Lau Shu-bill ( Chan Kwok-Bong ) is a serial killer . He murders prostitutes in very nasty ways . He wants to dispatch these filthy women , releasing them from their misery and giving them a better shot in the next life . This HK sickie is very well-made and has some rather unpleasant scenes of sexual violence and butchery . There is also plenty of sleazy sex to satisfy fans of exploitation cinema . Chan Kwok-Bong is frighteningly realistic as a sicko killer . The film is not for everyone , but if you're into extreme Asian cinema give this one a look . Recommended .
Pure exploitation filth .	This time Laura Gemser as a journalist Emanuelle goes under cover in a modern day harem and exposes what really goes at diplomatic parties in Venice . She then gets involved with corrupt American politician and finds herself entangled in conspiracy run by men who are abducting young women and torturing / butchering them in snuff films . " Emanuelle in America " is so dirty , smut-filled and exploitative that it really has to be seen to be believed . This film is loaded with sex , sadistic torture and murder , violence and bestiality , but the action is pretty dull at times . The unerotic porno inserts are full of ugly people , however the snuff sequences are truly vile and sickening , but they appear quite briefly . We're talking nipples being hacked off , meat hooks rammed up bloodied vaginas , giant dildos filled with hot tar forced down unwilling throats etc . " Emanuelle in America " is jaw-droppingly sleazy . It even has Paola Senatore giving a hand job to a horse named Pedro . Laura Gemser is great as a curious Emanuelle and it's a visual pleasure to see her naked . Once seen , never forgotten " Emanuelle in America " is one of the best films made by the Godfather of Sleaze , Joe D'Amato . .
Still creepy after 25 years !	" The Fog " has the special place in my heart-it is one of the first horror movies I have ever seen . Everyone knows the plot , so let's concentrate on the other things . First of all the photography by Dean Cundey is absolutely brilliant ( Cundey worked together with Carpenter on " Halloween " and " The Thing " ) . " The Fog " certainly delivers some scares-the ghostly sea crew appears as shadows and aren't seen much . Jamie Lee Curtis is perfect as one of the leads and it's nice to see her famous mother , Janet Leigh in the film ! All in all if you haven't seen this one check it out as soon as possible . A must-see for horror fans . .
Claude Chabrol's masterpiece .	When Patricia Newell is attacked after witnessing her cousin's murder , Detective Carrella searches the city for her killer . Identifying the murderer after an intensive manhunt , Patricia is sent to live with relatives in the country . For Carrella the case is closed . . . or is it ? " Blood Relatives " is an overlooked masterpiece . Donald Sutherland plays a cop and it's nice to see Donald Pleasance in a small role as a child molester . The conclusion is pretty disturbing . Still " Blood Relatives " is more of a mystery than a horror film , so fans of gore will be disappointed . A must-see for fans of old-fashioned mystery movies . .
Decent thriller .	A psycho killer is slashing beautiful strippers in New York . Tom Berenger tries to stop him ! " Fear City " is pretty good , but it's obvious that scenes of violence were heavily cut . It's really a shame , I'd love to see an uncut version . The urban setting of New York and the whole story reminds me a little bit " Maniac " ( 1980 ) and " The New York Ripper " ( 1982 ) . There's plenty of sleaze and tons of nudity ( even Melanie Griffith is naked in a couple of scenes ! ) . So if you like Abel Ferrara movies ( " Ms 45 " , " Driller Killer " ) check out this vastly underrated film .
Very good horror film .	Rick Bota's " Hellraiser : Hellseeker " is a straight-to-video horror film that offers plenty of morbid atmosphere . Kirsty Cotton ( Ashely Laurence ) is married to Trevor ( Dean Winters ) . This guy knows very little about Kirsty's past . He also sees really strange things and is slowly losing contact with reality . " Hellraiser : Hellseeker " is easily among the best three " Hellraiser " films . It's surpassed only by the first two films . Unfortunately there is only a little bit of gore , so splatter freaks will be disappointed . In many ways " Hellraiser : Hellseeker " has a similar look and feel to " Hellraiser : Inferno " , in which we find ourselves watching a stark reality that is very much our own . Of course there is also the matter of Pinhead , the Cenobites and the famous puzzle box . However they only make a token appearance toward the movie's end . Still this film is quite good , so if you're a fan of " Hellraiser " movies give it a look . .
Very interesting nunsploitation flick .	Flavia ( Florinda Bolkan of " Don't Torture a Duckling " fame ) is locked away in a convent of carnal desires by her father . Tired of all of the sadism she sees around her ( rape of a young woman in a pigsty , sexual cravings , horse castration ) Flavia decides to run from the convent with her Jewish friend from the outside , Abraham . The two don't get very far before they are captured and then brought back to be tortured and forced to repent . After punishment she joins up with a band of Muslims called the Tarantulas , who had invaded the convent prior and leads a crusade that turns into nothing short of a bloody battle behind the convent walls . " Flavia the Heretic " is a well-directed and fairly notorious piece of Italian nunsploitation . The film is slightly gruesome and sleazy at times . The acting is great and the characters are well-developed . Overall , " Flavia the Heretic " is a genuinely moving and intelligent movie with plenty of nudity and gore . You can't go wrong with it . .
Fun and entertaining horror anthology .	Lewis Teague's " Cat's Eye " contains three wry , humorous and creepy stories linked to the cat which roams from one tale to the next . First up there is my personal favourite " Quitters Inc . " , the story of family man Mr Morrison ( James Woods ) who goes to a very unconventional place to help people quit smoking and has his life turned into a living hell . Secondly , there is " The Ledge " , the tale of a washed-up tennis player who is forced to walk around the ledge of a hotel by a rich mobster after the tennis player steals his wife . And finally there is " The General " , which involves a cat saving a little girl ( Drew Barrymore ) from a tiny goblin that comes in the night to take children's souls . The three stories are linked together by a cat that traverses from New York to Atlantic City to North Carolina . " Cat's Eye " is more comic than horrifying . Still I enjoyed it very immensely and you should too , if you are a fan of Stephen King and his works . .
Erotic , yet bizarre art-house horror / drama .	" Frustration " is a quintessential , low-budget and sleazy Eurotika's horror / drama from the Pope Of Perversion himself , director Jose Benazeraf ( recent recipient of the ' Golden Penis ' for lifetime achievement in porn ) . Tormented by incestuous fantasies , a sexually repressed woman makes love to her brother's wife and then kills herself . This truly bizarre piece of 1970s Eurosleaze is not easy to analyze . It's also loaded with scenes of sex and torture , but the nudity is pretty sparse and not explicit . " Frustration " has been passed for cinema exhibition in 1972 , rated X of course , but has never submitted on video . It's a crying shame , because this stylish little " Repulsion " knock-off needs to be seen . Give it a look . .
Pretty entertaining trash from Rene Cardona Jr .	This Mexican adventure is a real treat for fans of cult movies . It has plenty of gore and violence including decapitations , throat cuttings etc . The scene where one guy has his eyes gouged out by some bloodthirsty crabs is the goriest bit and it reminds me the spiders sequence from Lucio Fulci's masterful " The Beyond " ( 1981 ) . The cast is decent-a horror veteran Donald Pleasance ( " Halloween " , " Paganini Horror " ) shines as a Nazi adventurer . So if you are a fan of gory adventure movies like " Mountain of the Cannibal God " or " Cut and Run " give this one a look . " The Treasure of the Amazon " is not easy to find though !
Truly underrated horror film .	A suicidal mental patient ( Zelijko Ivanek ) turns his horrific nightmares into reality by choosing receivers for his demented thoughts from the local hospital . Psychiatrist ( Kathryn Harrold ) realizes the young man's power and tries to save him . " The Sender " is a very creepy horror film that has slick production values . The acting is surprisingly good and the film perfectly mixes reality with unsettling hallucinations . There is only a little bit of blood , but the atmosphere of dread and fear is easy to feel . There are some wonderful moments of pure horror like the scene where an Etc machine is switched on and an entire operating room erupts in a slow-motion explosion . The film is relatively obscure , but if you get the chance watch it . . Highly recommended .
One of my favourite horror movies from early 80's .	This gory horror movie obviously influenced by Stuart Rosenberg's " Amityville Horror " ( 1979 ) , " Friday the 13th " ( 1980 ) and Dario Argento's stylish works really scared me when I first saw it . " Superstition " is fast-paced , unintentionally hilarious at times , but it can be pretty scary as well . There's enough gruesome gore and violence to satisfy all splatter fans , and the score is also quite effective . My favourite kill scene is where a young man is chopped in half with sliding windows . Among the other gory highlights there's also a head exploding in the microwave , a young woman , who has a spike hammered into her forehead and many more . Anyway , if you're consider yourself a horror buff , give this one a try . . Highly recommended .
Prepare for total hell .	I'm into extreme cinema , but " Scrapbook " totally shocked me . It's so disturbing and hard to watch that sometimes I really had the urge to stop the tape . However I managed to watch the entire movie and this is not an easy thing to do . The plot isn't complicated : a young woman , Clara ( Emily Haack ) is abducted by Leonard ( Tommy Biondo , who sadly died after the film was completed ) , a brutal serial killer who forces his victims to write about their ordeals in his scrapbook . After her abduction Clara is repeatedly raped , beaten and tortured-the violence seen in the movie is extremely brutal and disturbing . Some scenes like a really graphic bottle rape sequence are truly sickening . The acting is excellent-Tommy Biondo and Emily Haack are extremely convincing here . Very talented director Eric Stanze ( " Savage Harvest " , " Ice from the Sun " ) creates a totally overwhelming atmosphere of dread and fear . This guy is , along with Jim Van Bebber , one of the bravest American horror directors ever . Check out this ugly masterpiece , if you dare . All I can say is that if you want to see an extreme piece of gut wrenching horror and are not easily offended , " Scrapbook " is truly unforgettable . .
Bloody good fun .	Juan Piquer Simon's " Pieces " is one of the most hilarious slasher movies ever made . In the early 1940's a little boy is caught by his mother while he is assembling a puzzle with a naked lady on it . The boy gets mad when his mother takes his puzzle , so he kills her with an axe . 40 years later somebody butchers random college chicks with a chainsaw . " Pieces " is a highly entertaining gore trash filled with enough blood to satisfy horror fans . There is for example a lopped off arm , a severed flying head and a knife through the mouth murder scene . The ending is incredibly surprising and hysterical . There is also a violent kung fu teacher and death by mirror . So if you're a slasher / giallo fan give this one a look-you won't be disappointed . .
Truly hot classic of German porn .	" Sensational Janine " is one of the best porno movies I have seen . The film is narrated by Janine as she discusses her humble beginnings and her rise to become one of the top courtesans the world has ever seen . In her youth times she has oral sex with her brother and loses her virginity to the delivery boy . Her sexual awakening is insatiable and she becomes a nymphomaniac . . . First of all I'm a rabid fan of horror / exploitation cinema . I prefer my porn mixed with horror . However " Sensational Janine " blew me away . The film contains lots of steamy sex scenes that are extremely titillating . They are explicit , but never become dull . Patricia Rhomberg in the lead is amazing . She is cute and charismatic and has a wonderful body . So if you are a fan of old-fashioned porn without ugly silicone enhanced porn starlets give it a look . . I had a great time watching this XXX classic .
Brutal and savage French horror .	" Frontieres " by Xavier Gens plays like the berserk and utterly deranged French version of " The Texas Chainsaw Massacre " and " Hostel " with the family of bloodthirsty Neo-Nazis instead of stereotypical redneck crazies . The violence with the exception of the great and gory band saw scene is rather suggestive and wasn't explicit with the camera panning away or jump cutting almost all the gory bits . Still " Frontieres " is a very intense and visceral experience that will surely please the most hardcore horror fans . The killings are pretty brutal in their extremity , the acting is fine and some scenes are incredibly intense . I enjoyed the music in this flick , which was excellently blended into the action . The plot goes like that : running from Paris the group of youths end up taking refuge at a run-down motel on the Luxembourg border presided over by the Von Geisler family and is thrown into bloody nightmare . The two older " sisters " entice the guys with a vigorous foursome while the marginally less depraved youngest girl-plucked from her real family years earlier to be a breeding vessel for this one-assists our heroine when she is eyed up as representing new blood to continue the family line . .
Pretty good slasher flick .	Elizabeth Cox plays Jennifer , star checkout girl of the Walnut Lane Supermarket which is due to be sold by its two managers and the teenage are reducing the goods for a closing down sale when a psycho killer invades and begins knocking them off in some brutal and very inventive ways indeed ! It's a pity that excessively gory scenes were removed from this release though what has been left is of gory-enough proximity . Yes , the cuts in some scenes are almost laughable . Director Scott Spiegel has a penchant for innovative camera angles which he uses at every opportunity he gets . Plenty of suspense , likeable cast , pretty violent murders ( including usual stabbings , impalings on meat-hook , a bandsaw lobotomy and yes ! - a trash compactor head squish ) . All in all , " Intruder " is a great thrill and definitely not for the squeamish . Check it out-you won't be disappointed . Highly recommended .
Bizarre and unsettling Japanese horror film .	" Infection " takes place in an old , dilapidated hospital that is barely able to keep its door open to the public due to a constant lack of adequate medicine , facilities and staff . The hospital is riddled with agony and suffering of countless patients and the strain on the doctors and nurses has reached the critical point . A doctor's negligence causes a patient to die and the panicked hospital staff decides to cover up the fatal mistake setting off a deadly chain of events . Paramedics bring a new patient into the hospital that has been stricken with so deadly that his innards have mysteriously disintegrated . The doctors attempt to contain the virus , but the ill patient escapes through the ventilation system ensuring that everyone inside the doomed hospital will have to fight for their lives from this horrifying epidemic . Unlike overrated " Cabin Fever " , " Infection " is a creepy and unsettling horror film . This is the first genre movie from the Taka Ichise-produced J-Horror Theater series . Director Masayuki Ochiai is already well-known as the director of " Parasite Eve " and " Hypnosis " , while the cast includes Kôichi Satô , the star of " Rasen " . " Infection " delivers its share of squirm inducing and gory moments and it certainly gets under your skin . Just ignore negative comments and enjoy this creepy piece of horror . .
Great piece of psychedelic sleaze .	Directed by Renato Polselli " Reincarnation of Isabel " has been long considered to be missing , disappearing after its failed initial showing in 1972-1973 . The film is pretty confusing and badly written , so fans of bizarre Italian exploitation won't be disappointed . There is some gore and witchery plus plenty of sleaze . The women in this film take almost every opportunity to strip down-and that's not a bad thing in my book . A Satanic cult , as a part of an ancient rite to revive a witch who died 400 years earlier , must sacrifice a group of seven virgins . Trouble erupts when one of the prospective victim's lovers interrupts the rituals , and the witches turn into vampires and wreak havoc on the town . Renato Polselli managed to create a dreamlike atmosphere punctuated with many scenes of naked women attacked , raped , terrorized and murdered . Overall , I enjoyed this film and you should too , if you like Italian sleaze .
Hilarious and completely repulsive .	" Sweet Movie " has to be one of the most controversial films ever made . The plot follows the adventures of a beauty queen ( Carole Laure ) , a certified virgin who escapes a disastrous honeymoon with the richest man in the world to join a group of carefree sensualists . The latter are the once-notorious Otto Mühl troupe , who delight in pissing and defecating as a public spectacle . This is cross-cut with the journey of the good ship SS Survival ( which sports Karl Marx for a masthead ) on the Seine . This boat features a cargo of sugar , a demented crew , a revolutionary zealot captain and her lover , a refugee from the Battleship Potemkin . " Sweet Movie " is a quite shocking stuff for example it intersperses documentary footage of Holocaust grave excavations throughout . The scenes of defecation , pissing and puking will certainly shock some casual viewers , but if you like surreal and twisted cinema you can't miss it . My other recommendations : " Salo : The 120 Days of Sodom " , " Viva La Muerte " , " Blue Movie " , " Love Doll " , " The Pig Fucking Movie " and " Funeral Procession of Roses " .
Very sick and depraved stuff .	Herman Yau's " Ebola Syndrome " is a gruesome Hong Kong horror in the tradition of " Bunman : The Untold Story " and " Dr . Lamb " . Anthony Wong is incredible as Kai San-he is one of the most depraved characters I have ever seen . Still the tone of the film isn't really disturbing - " Ebola Syndrome " can be very humorous at times . However if you're squeamish don't watch this one-there is torture , rape , dismemberment , masturbation with pork product , cannibalism and plenty of heavy violence on display . The plot is simple : Wong plays a deranged serial killer who flees Hong Kong after committing multiple murders and ends up contracting the Ebola Virus during his brief hideout in Africa . After murdering several people in Africa he returns to Hong Kong with some stolen money to start all over again . But now he is the Ebola carrier and he is spreading deadly virus . . . Overall , " Ebola Syndrome " doesn't quite live up to " Bunman : The Untold Story " , however fans of extreme cinema should be pleased .
The sleaziest Cat III flick I have ever seen .	Julie Lee plays a sex starved woman named Linda , who kills horny men during wild sex . You see , the woman is crazed because of her abusive childhood , when she was raped by her drunken uncle and his friends . When she contracts HIV from one of her victims , her world falls apart . The first part of " Trilogy of Lust " series was originally shot as hard core porno , the second installment is strictly soft core , but it surely offers tons of sleaze and kinky sex . The sex scenes are surprisingly perverse and the film also features two rape scenes , footage from which is often inter-cut with the consensual sex sequences . A few scenes of torture and murder are suitably shocking . " Trilogy of Lust II " is a pure cinematic filth , thus worth checking out for fans of outrageously sleazy Asian exploitation .
Pretty good Spanish horror flick .	This rarely seen and surprisingly obscure Spanish horror flick tells the story of Maria , a mysterious woman , who is suspected by local people of being a witch . Maria has left the company of men and women , and now lives in a lonely mountain-top cabin with her supposed father named Gabriel . One of the main characters , Roger , falls in love with her . Unfortunately bad things happen : windows shatter , pots fall from shelves , burning wood turns cool and ineffective . Roger hypnotizes Maria to solve the mystery of her unwanted supernatural powers . It seems that Maria is possessed by the spirit of the princess of Montezuma . " Rape " is a little bit sleazy and rather bizarre horror flick with lovely Nadiuska providing some nudity . The script is nothing special , but the location sets provide plenty of eeriness . Director Miguel Iglesias Bonns is principally known for Paul Naschy wolfman movie " Night of the Howling Beast " . .
Disturbing and bloody as hell .	The film's plot revolves around a pregnant woman who , through circumstances of her own creation , becomes the victim of a female stalker . " Inside " is easily one of the bloodiest , most brutal and savage assaults on the viewer's mind I have ever seen . It starts like a downbeat thriller and soon turns into incredibly tense bloodbath . Beatrice Dalle of " Trouble Every Day " fame is spectacular as the remorseless female psychopath . The gore is truly extreme and plentiful and one can almost feel an acrid smell of death in the air . Bustillo and Maury make the pregnant woman and her baby the target of the violence which is perhaps the most controversial aspect of the film . If you enjoyed " Haute Tension " you can't go wrong with even nastier " Inside " . .
Creepy gem .	This stylish and very eerie thriller stars Lili Palmer as Senora Fourneau , the severe headmistress of a French boarding school for wayward young women . The rigid constraints of 19th-century social conditioning have turned the school into a hotbed of uncontrolled sexual urges . Soon it is discovered that one by one , the young girls are vanishing . It is assumed they are sneaking away at night , so the school is securely locked down at night . But the young women continue to go missing , as it appears a mysterious assassin is stalking the dark hallways of the ghostly manor . " La Residencia " by Chicho Ibáñez-Serrador combines Gothic atmosphere of Mario Bava's early horror movies with plenty of tension . The film resembles a lot Dario Argento's masterpiece " Suspiria " - the young Cristina Galbó who plays the new arrival at the school-looks like and has the general doe-eyed demeanour of Suzy Banyon . All the main characters are well-developed and intriguing and the acting is fantastic . The murder scenes are stylish and the film deals with several taboos surrounding sexuality . So anyone who is a fan of Hammer , Bava or Argento will probably find something to appreciate in this obscure gem . .
Brutal and nihilistic horror .	On one last road trip before they're sent to serve in Vietnam , two friends and their sexy girlfriends get into an accident that calls their local sheriff Hoyt to the scene . He drags the teenagers to the dreaded Hewitt compound , where they will be dismembered and gutted for dinner by the youngest member of the cannibal clan , the disfigured Thomas ( aka Leatherface ) . I'm not a big fan of Marcus Nispel's " The Texas Chainsaw Massacre " remake and I hated " Darkness Falls " , but this piece of sadistic horror blew me away . Liebesman's movie is not about building up tension-it simply assaults the viewer with buckets of gore and sheer sadism . The film looks fantastic due to the dark , brooding cinematography of Lukas Ettlin . Of course it lacks the gritty atmosphere of the original , but gorehounds should be pleased . Recommended .
Satanic horror drama not for the easily offended .	" Don't Deliver Us From Evil " tells the simple story of two teenage convent girls who dedicate ourselves to Satan . Gorgeous raven-haired Anne and her best friend Lore are fascinated by evil . After renouncing Jesus Christ they start to seduce men , kill the groundskeeper's bird and perform various acts of blasphemy . The film is pretty controversial as the both actresses look very young . It's disturbing to watch a child-like girl getting her clothes torn off . There's a lot of sacrilegious imagery and it seems that the director clearly hates Catholic Church , but the violence is kept to minimum . The sleaze is quite plentiful , though . The film is inspired by the original ' Heavenly Creatures ' Pauline Parker and Juliet Hammond , the two girls whose close friendship resulted in murder . It studies the themes of female friendship and teenagers alienation and questions faith and rules . I applaud it for that . .
An enjoyable piece of grainy horror !	William Girdler's " Three on a Meathook " is obviously inspired by the Ed Gein case . It's a very bizarre tale of a twisted murder and cannibalism in the tradition of Tobe Hooper's " Texas Chain Saw Massacre " . There's plenty of nudity and cheesy gore , however the film is not as gory as the title suggests . Still there are some good kill scenes , a good amount of blood plus a nice plot twist at the end . The film is quite slow at times , but its low-budget gives it a raw look . Highly recommended and a good companion piece to " Daddy's Deadly Darling " ( 1972 ) - another grainy horror masterpiece from early 70's .
Disturbing shocker with great Simon Yam .	In August , 1983 a photo lab technician complained to his manager about disturbing photos of a mutilated female body on a customer's roll of film . This was the second time the manager had noticed this particular customer's unusual photos and this time he called the police . The photo was of a severed human breast . This was approximately the 700th such photo his store had processed for this customer . The cops took the customer , Lam Go-wan into custody and after sweating him for two days he confessed to murdering the woman in the photographs . Then he kept on confessing . . . In 1992 , Danny Lee and Kent Cheng Jat-si teamed up to film the true crime biopic of Lam Go-wan , Hong Kong's first and maybe only serial killer . " Dr . Lamb " is an excellent III Cat . shocker that offers some gruesome imagery including cold-blooded murder , necrophilia , dismemberment and breast mutilation . I own uncut DVD-R composite with English subtitles that has all the scenes of sexual violence intact , so if you want to see this uncensored try to find ultra-rare Spanish Manga Video release . Simon Yam's performance as the Taxi Cab Killer is truly haunting and out-of-control . One thing that I found pretty impressive were the actresses that played the murder victims , they had to lay around as corpses while the serial killer mutilated them . So if you want to see a chillingly horrific piece of horror give " Dr . Lamb " a look . .
Creepy and fascinating thriller .	Jiney is a young photographer , but she is not satisfied with her work . One day , she witnesses a car crash which stimulates her to take some pictures of its dying victims . The girl starts obsessively making photos of dead and dying people and animals . This morbid fascination with death become her ghastly obsession . These images of death and destruction turns on Jiney and when she is finally able to shoot a suicide , she finds complete sexual relief and totally losses herself . However , knowing that her sexual desires are not right , Jiney wants to stop this before it gets out of control . Together with her intimate friend Jas , Jiney starts to acknowledge her wrong behaviour . Suddenly she receives a snuff video from a killer who is sharing the same artistic idea about death as Jiney . " Ab-normal Beauty " is a pretty unsettling thriller made by Pang brothers . It's a fascinating look into a young woman's obsession with death . The film is loaded with truly ominous and dark atmosphere and there are some lashings of gore that may shock casual viewers . The S & M style killer looks creepy but his identity is rather easy to guess . The film is colorful and stylish as it resembles a truly moody painting . Give it a look . .
Gloomy and brutal horror film .	" Seed " doesn't deserve all the bile and hatred on IMDb . It's arguably the best Uwe Boll's horror film so far-an unflinching exercise in barbaric human cruelty that shows that the man is the cruelest animal . The movie begins with archival footage of humans being exceptionally cruel to a variety of suffering animals which truly made me squirm . Max Seed is a brutal serial killer . He filmed many of his murders . The decomposing baby scene is quite unsettling . After killing several policemen in his dark house Seed is captured . He is quickly executed on electric chair and buried in a shallow grave . However the killer rises from its tomb ready for sickening vengeance . . . Very gloomy , raw and disturbing horror film with truly revolting hammer murder scene . It's an exceptionally well-acted and unrelenting assault on viewer's mind . I applaud Uwe Boll for making such savage piece of horror . Ignore the negative reviews and see it for yourself . .
Bone-chilling and disturbing portrayal of insanity .	" Deranged " is clearly based on the gruesome activities of necrophiliac serial killer Ed Gein with only few script changes . Ezra Cobb is devoted to his ailing mother and is deeply distraught when she dies . After one year living alone on the farm , he hears her voice talking to him and digs her body up and brings it home . Soon he gets the idea of digging up the bodies of other recently buried deceased and bringing them home to make companions for his mother . He also makes costumes to wear out of their faces and skins , as well as musical instruments out of skin and bones . Living prey becomes his next fixation . . . Downbeat and disturbing shocker which follows Gein story in great detail . There's a really shocking scene that was censored from many of the prints released in 1974 , where Ezra returns from the graveside with a severed head and next we see him gouging out the eyeball and then cutting open the skull with a hacksaw and scooping the brains out with a spoon , before severing the face . The scenes with Micki Moore a prisoner in the house are also unsettling ? she stumbling into the living room to find it filled with a circle of desiccated corpses and then the unexpected moment when one of the bodies starts moving and winds up a music box , which proves to be Blossom dressed in a blonde wig and face mask . Blossom is perfect as a completely whacked out psycho . .
Very creepy and sleazy Spanish horror .	" Satan's Blood " has to be one of the most underrated Spanish horror films ever made . It's sleazy and genuinely creepy Satanic horror flick co-produced by Juan Piquer Simon and well-directed by Carlos Puerto . Andy and Thelma , a couple living in Madrid leave their apartment for a pleasant day around the city with their dog Blackie . They cross paths with Bruno and Anne , a strange couple who invite them to their eerie country estate . Unbeknownst to them , Bruno and Anne are devil worshippers . . . Very atmospheric chiller that offers plenty of sleaze and full-frontal nudity . The scenes with a creepy porcelain child doll scared the hell out of me . The opening scene of nasty rape-murder in a Satanists ' coven is wonderful . " Satan's Blood " is extremely hard to find , but if you are a fan of sleazy Spanish horror give it a look . .
Absolutely awesome Italian occult horror film .	" The Perfume of the Lady in Black " by Francesco Barilli is an extremely stylish and beautifully shot occult horror film that is often regarded as one of the most underrated Italian horror movies ever made . This film influenced the works of Dario Argento-there are themes and set-pieces that would re-appear , virtually unchanged , in Argento's " Deep Red " , " Suspiria " and " Inferno " . The cinematography is simply astounding and the score by Nicola Piovani is genuinely creepy . Mimsy Farmer plays an industrial scientist named Silvia who is troubled by strange hallucinations . These images that seem so real point to a tragic event from her childhood : the suicide of her mother . " The Perfume of the Lady in Black " is obviously inspired by both " Don't Look Now " and " Rosemary's Baby " , but there are some lashings of grisly violence ( the evisceration / cannibalism scene is particularly nasty and gruesome ) . Overall , this Italian baffling psycho-shocker is a suitably unsettling exercise in psychological horror with incredibly beautiful Mimsy Farmer . A must-see for anyone interested in Italian horror . .
Nacho Cerda's visually mesmerizing masterpiece .	I'm a rabid fan of Nacho Cerda's artful necro-shocker " Aftermath " , but " Genesis " simply blew me away , when I first saw it on cinema screen in Warsaw nearly two years ago . This stunningly beautiful horror / short concentrates more on an extensive plot and theme , but still carries with it Cerda's taste for highly disturbing and confrontational imagery . Seemingly inspired by the classic Greek tale of Pygmalion and Galatea , " Genesis " concerns a sculptor whose wife has died suddenly in a car accident . Unable to cope with his grief , he begins to create a sculpture in her image . But as his work progresses , the sculpture begins to become flesh and blood , even as its maker's own skin becomes hard and stone-like . " Genesis " is extremely beautiful , sad and heart-wrenching film about undying love and merciless death . Absolutely recommended . - what else ?
Depressing , disgusting , excellent !	" Castle Freak " is brilliant ! It's gory and downbeat film from Stuart Gordon ( " Re-Animator " , " From Beyond " ) - I love it ! Anyway this one has a cult fave Jeffrey Combs and a rather frumpy Barbara Crampton moving into a castle where a freak has been chained in a dungeon for many years . It kills a hooker brought home by Combs , then goes after the family . Great special effects , good direction and solid acting . Gordon manages to create some pretty tense moments ( especially this gruesome sex / death scene ! ) , and there are enough good scares and shocks to make you jump a few times . The scene , when freak bites off hooker's nipple is pretty repulsive and disturbing . A must-see for genre fans !
Brilliant trash !	Sam Firstenberg's " Ninja 3 : The Domination " mixes martial arts with " The Exorcist " like horror . The horror elements thrown on screen are simply laughable , but the film works as a mindless action / martial arts flick . The fight scenes are well-choreographed and exciting , and the film is never boring . So forget stupid dialogue , lame acting and annoying soundtrack-grab some beer and check this one out ! Highly recommended !
Excellent pinku eiga shocker .	" Beautiful Girl Hunter " by Norifumi Suzuki is based on manga by Maasaki Soto . The film portrays the life of Tatsuya , a young man of proper descent whose outward respectability hides his urges for rape and torture . This handsome rapist seduces women , then brings them to the basement of the mansion he inherited from his well-to-do parents , where he indulges in lengthy sessions of sado-sexual violence . An explanation of sorts is given for Tatsuya's sinister urges : he was conceived when his mother was violated by a deranged serial rapist while his father was forced to watch . Then one night , one of his victims escapes . The young woman , who has been kept locked in a cage in the basement for several weeks and subjected to humiliation , degradation , torture and rape , runs from the house screaming , right into the arms of a passer-by . Though she thinks she has found safety , this person is none other than Tatsuya's natural father , the serial rapist . He brings her back to the house where he joins his son in his activities . From that moment the torture and violence shift into an even higher gear . " Beautiful Girl Hunter " is a nasty Japanese pinku eiga shocker filled with with nudity , whipping and rapes . The cinematography is beautiful and the acting is great . If you liked this one check out also classy Japanese nunsploitation flick " Convent of the Sacred Beast " by Norifumi Suzuki . .
Another grisly and disturbing Cat III shocker	" Red to Kill " is one of the classic Category III psycho-sicko flicks . It is about the teacher of retarded children who goes completely crazy in front of color red because of one trauma . He falls in love with one of his students , a childlike teenage girl but soon discovers her red underwear . What follows is an unspeakable acts of terror , rape , self mutilation and very disturbing violence . " Red to Kill " is extremely strong and disturbing piece of horror . This is the kind of film even ' jaded ' HK cinema fans seem to dislike and judge as sick and repellent . Of course it's gratuitous but has also some interesting points and thoughts about society's care for retarded people who can , and sometimes are much more ' human ' and kind than the normal ones . The scene after he brutally raped one of the retarded girls where she is standing alone in the shower traumatised and hacking away at her pubic hair with a razor blade whilst murmuring " dirty . . . dirty . . . dirty ! " is a jaw dropper . So if you're a fan of extreme cinema give this little gem a look . .
Gorgeous horror .	First of all I have been a fan of Nacho Cerda's movies since 2000 . I consider his two shorts " Aftermath " and " Genesis " as one of the most visually stunning and beautiful films ever made . I finally had a chance to see his full-length debut " The Abandoned " on DVD and was blown away . The cinematography is utterly beautiful . Nacho Cerda manages to make an isolated farmhouse and forest incredibly creepy . The film is definitely one of the best technically executed horror films that I have seen in a long time with top notch sound design and decent acting . 40-year old Marie learns that her mysterious , unknown birth mother has left her some property . She journeys to Russia , meets the twin brother she never knew she had and gets stuck in a house full of ghosts of the past . One hell of a creepy and menacing film that oozes atmosphere . .
Brilliant Mario Bava's shocker !	" Kill Baby Kill " is a truly remarkable film , boasting superb cinematography and incredibly eerie atmosphere . It contains some really memorable and impressive imagery : a misty Transylvanian village , dusty corridors , black cats , creepy dolls , shadowy figures stealing through fog-bound graveyards etc . The film is so wonderfully weird it has to be seen to be appreciated . Mario Bava really was a master of Gothic Horror !
Totally overlooked and creepy horror flick !	After robbing an army payroll , the thieves escape in a stolen plane , taking the pilot and his daughter as hostages . While flying away , one of the robbers dives out of a plane with all the money . He lands on a small farm house with a large corn field and strange looking scarecrows all over it , hanging on crosses . He steals an old truck and begins to escape through the large corn field . But the other robbers land the plane to go after him and the money . Soon they are all murdered by evil scarecrows . This is surely one of my favourite horror movies . It is loaded with some eerie and creepy shots of the woods and the scarecrows hanging on crosses . There is also some gore and the makeup effects made by Norman Cabrera ( " Fright Night 2 " ) are extremely well-done . The killings are brutal , especially the scene when one robber is stabbed in his face . If you like the gory stuff , you'll love this one . Highly recommended .
" This place is cursed ! "	" Friday the 13th " became the second highest grossing film of the summer of 1980 ( behind " The Empire Strikes Back " , whose profits were not nearly as great when you factored its budget ) . Although somewhat inspired by Carpanter's " Halloween " , this bloody slasher went on to become a true classic in it's own right , which was mostly due to depiction of the murders . The killings in " Friday the 13th " were brutal and gory , and considered quite shocking for it's day . There are four memorable gore scenes in this movie : 1 ) a female counsellors ( Robbie Margan ) throat is slit 2 ) Kevin Bacon gets an arrow through his neck 3 ) his girlfriend ( Jeannine Taylor ) gets an axe in the face 4 ) finally Mrs Pamela Voorhees ( Betsy Palmer ) is decapitated . The make-up and cosmetic effects were made by Tom Savini . The scene at the end , when Jason ( Ari Lehman ) suddenly appears , has the biggest shock impact of the whole film . The plot is simple : A guy named Steve Christie ( Peter Brouer ) re-opens the supposedly cursed Camp Crystal Lake ( Camp Blood ) , only to have the nubile young counsellors viciously murdered by an unseen killer during the rainstorm which isolates the camp . Anyway , if you haven't seen this splatter classic , try to find this one . Definitely recommended .
Truly brilliant erotic horror .	A thief ( Jean Marie Lemaire ) , on the run from fellow gang members , takes refuge in a château populated only by two young women ? Eva ( Brigitte Lahaie ) and Elisabeth ( Franka Mai ) . The man is seduced and lured to stay for a forthcoming soirée , while the young ladies-themselves indulging in lesbian encounters ? turn out to be initiates in a cult of bourgeois women addicted to drinking human blood . Jean Rollin's " Fascination " is simply an awesome lesbian vampire flick . The pace is pretty slow , but there is plenty of sleaze and beauty to enjoy . The film is loaded with stunning visuals for example the image of a nude Brigitte Lahaie with nothing but her impossibly statuesque figure , cape and scythe moving down the bridge and over the moat to the castle or truly surreal scene of Eva and Elizabeth dancing on the bridge in matching white gowns while an old-style phonograph plays classical music . Overall , I deeply enjoyed this one and you should too , if you liked " The Living Dead Girl " or " Lips Of Blood " .
Cult classic .	Gerald Potterton's " Heavy Metal " is definitely one of the best animation movies ever made . It has everything : violence , sex , nudity , humor and intelligent story . Great soundtrack by such hard rock / heavy metal groups like Black Sabbath , Nazareth , Devo , Blue Oyster Cult , Journey , Sammy Hagar , Trust , Grand Funk Railroad etc . My favourite segment from " Heavy Metal " is " B-17 " - this one is dark , bloody and creepy ! My highest recommendation .
Very dark and grim horror film .	Romano Scavolini's " Nightmare " is one of the grimmest horror movies ever made . Baird Stafford is extremely believable as George Tatum , a schizophrenic serial killer who murders uncontrollably . He has been supposedly cured of his psychological disorder due to a new magical medicine . In actuality the cure doesn't work very well , because Tatum starts killing people . " Nightmare " isn't as good as " Maniac " - still there are some genuinely atmospheric and chilling moments . The opening scene is extremely creepy . The killings are cold-blooded and brutal . The gore is pretty strong-the climatic double axe murder scene is incredibly gory . To sum up , if you're a fan of early 80's extreme horror give this one a look . Highly recommended .
