The film has a good point to make . . . it just does it in a poor way .	What were the people thinking who made this film ? ! I understand that they wanted to do something positive , but the end result is pretty lame and seems rather irresponsible to me - - plus the film is like propaganda - - and poor propaganda at that . Now the idea of telling dog owners to be sure that the free pet they give away goes to a good home is a valid point - - I wish the film had focused more on this . Someone taking a free dog under false pretenses in order to exploit the dog might be a serious issue - - though I would love to see data showing this is , indeed , occurs with any regularity . When I was a kid , lots of stories about Asian families taking in free pets and eating them were common - - though later it turned out that these were mostly urban legends . So I wonder just how possible and " based on actual events " this film really is . I'll give you my summary and if you can clue me in that this is a serious and widespread problem , I'll retract my review - - though this film sure looks and sounds like an urban legend and it's not especially well made . The film begins with a lady calling about an ad for a free dog and then arranges to go visit the family . To clue you in that she " ain't right " , they show the same lady then talking to a stuffed toy bunny about how great it will be to get a new friend . In the next scene , you see someone leaving the home of the pet to be given away - - and it seems that the couple giving away the animal didn't feel the person had an adequate home for the dog - - so they were apparently trying to do the right thing . The lady who phoned enters and everything seems to be going fine . In fact , the lady who wants to adopt the dog then brings in her dog and they seem to get along great . Once the lady who just adopted the dog goes home , and completely out of the blue , one of the dogs is playing with the bunny and the lady responds by bashing the two dogs to death and throwing them in the dumpster ! ! ! Talk about subtle ! What follows are some messages across the screen about the dangers of giving away dogs and how they will be eaten or abused or what have you . While this information at the end of story might be true , what in the heck did this have to do with a crazy woman bashing dogs to death with a frying pan ? ! Is there some frying pan-killing disorder that is responsible for thousands of dog deaths ? ! I was left confused and a bit angry - - like the film was propaganda and meant to scare the crap out of people . Were the couple giving away the dog expected to have a psychological evaluation done of anyone wishing to adopt their dog ? As I said above , if there is a widespread problem of people taking free pets and then beating them to death with frying pans or what have you , then show me the facts . If this is indeed a problem ( and not either an urban legend or an isolated incident of a nut or two ) , then I will remove my review . However , if there are puppy mills , medical labs and other unscrupulous folks taking free pets and abusing them , then why not make a film about that and not a nut with a frying pan ? ! It's just creepy and rather sick . If you haven't guessed , I hated this film . It is not entertaining and I am not sure if it's even educational .
Aside from casting Andy Devine or Marcel Marceau , I can't think of any actors LESS suited to a musical than the folks in this one ! !	Director , writer , producer Peter Bogdonovich has managed something amazing in AT LONG LAST LOVE . He actually managed to make a musical with leads who actually sang worse than those in Joshua Logan's PAINT YOUR WAGON . I used to think seeing and hearing Lee Marvin and Clint Eastwood singing in Logan's film was the height of horrid casting , but Bogdonovich managed to find four singers who were equal to or worse than Marvin and Eastwood . That's no small feat , as perhaps only Andy Devine and Marcel Marceau were more ill-suited to a musical than Madeline Kahn , Burt Reynolds , Cybill Shepherd and Duilio Del Prete ( not to mention many other supporting actors in the film who simply couldn't sing ) . And , by the way , WHO the heck is Duilio Del Prete and why is this Italian playing a guy called " the Spaniard " - - especially since his command of English and acting skills are marginal , at best ? ! Plus , his having previously been in THE ASSASSINATION OF TROTSKY wasn't exactly a glowing endorsement of his talents ! This is just one of many bizarre casting decisions by Bogdonovich . Bogdonovich's idea of making a homage to 1930s style musicals ( complete with excellent and familiar Cole Porter songs ) isn't bad at all . In many ways , the film is reminiscent of some of the Astaire / Rogers films - - minus the quality singing and dancing . In fact , it looks much more like a community theater or talent show production because of all the insane choices that brought the quality of the film to an unbelievably low level . It's really a shame , as a similar idea was very well executed in MOVIE MOVIE a film made about the same time as AT LONG LAST LOVE . Here , however , wretchedly inappropriate actors and singers doomed the film from the start - - especially since audience members really wanted to hear singing that didn't totally suck or see dancers with two left feet ( go figure ! ) . This film was crucified by the critics - - and deservedly so . The singing is simply so bad , so grating and so painful that the viewer is left to wonder what the heck everyone involved was thinking ! In fact , 1979's book , " The Fifty Worst Movies Ever Made " included it among it's selections - - and I heartily agree . Cole Porter must have spun in his grave like a rotisserie when this terribly failed experiment debuted . What an incredibly big waste of a nice idea and a film only of interest to the curious and bad movie buffs .
a dopey movie which didn't even bother to try	This movie provided NOTHING new or worthwhile . After seeing it , my wife and I both agreed that the studio simply churned this out and could have cared less if it was entertaining . This is a good example of a " concept only " film - - they have a concept about a film and the other details are unimportant because execs KNOW it will make $$ just based on the initial concept . The movie starts with Cruella getting out of prison and going on parole . She no longer hates puppies but has been programmed to adore them - - she simply couldn't hurt a flea . This doesn't last too long after her release and she's back to her old ways . Period . The most annoying aspects of the movie were the supporting characters . Eric Idle as the voice of Waddlesworth the bird made me HATE him - - and that is TOUGH considering I am a die-hard Python fan . It was obvious he did this because they gave him lots of money ( there can't be any other reason ) . Cruella's low self-esteem servant , Tim McInnerny , was funny in the Black Adder shows but here he is totally wasted and unfunny . And it must have cost a few bucks to get GÃ©rard Depardieu but he was utterly wasted as well . There were some other supporting actors as well but given how poorly written the characters were , I am trying to block them out of my mind . Overall , you'd be better just to let your kids watch television than bother letting them see this drivel .
only to be viewed by masochists !	This was a thoroughly disgusting and pointless film that only fatheads with an inflated sense of self-importance could watch and then praise . The movie is filled with disgusting images , sleaze and human bile - - something I would never hope to see again . Were these sentiments strong enough to hopefully keep you from seeing this film - - - I sure hope so ! My thorough disgust for the film isn't because it shows the lowest elements of Brazilian society - - after all , I was quick to praise films like CITY OF GOD and CENTRAL STATION - - and these films were violent and scary . However , their portrayals of the violence and cheapness of life in the lowest social strata were meant to be eye-opening and document the horrors - - not provide a voyeuristic chamber of horrors meant only to turn our stomachs . I won't even begin to describe all the viscerally vile images from MANGO YELLOW - - partly because they make me ill just thinking about it and partly because I could only take the movie to a certain point , then I made myself get up and turn it off ! In addition , the film is strongly anti-Christian and pro-filth - - so it tries at the onset to alienate much of its audience . I worry about the types of people who CAN watch this film all the way through and it DOESN'T nauseate them ! AVOID it at all costs . If you want a similar experience , go to a slaughterhouse ( it's in the film ) or stare at feces ( it's also in the film and is apparently eaten by one of the scum in the film ) . Thorough garbage .
ABout what you'd expect from a cheap early 60s horror flick	I bought this DVD for $1 at Walmart . After seeing it , I might just return to the store and try to get my money back ! The only reason I gave the movie a 2 and not a 1 is that the story has a few novel story elements , though it really never rises to the level of being interesting . This film has all the earmarks of being a made for the drive-in theaters market - - ultra-low budget , amateurish acting and a liberal dose of sex ( for an early 60s film ) . In fact , I wonder if perhaps the only reason the film was made was to make a fast buck AND because someone knew some strippers they could use as extras . The film is about a wacko doctor who wants to transplant his girlfriend's severed head onto the body of an unsuspecting donor . Most of the potential donors are skanky strippers or a model - - whose only real purpose in the film is to titillate as they remove most of their clothes . However , they keep too much on to make the movie even worth watching for the naughty bits and the film isn't quite awful enough to merit watching by bad film buffs .
Bad enough that you may enjoy watching it just to laugh at the whole mess !	There are two types of bad horror films - - those that are so dull and atrocious that no one likes them ( except masochists or mental patients ) and those that are so inept and silly that they are great for a laugh ( such as PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE ) . I would put this one in the second category , though it is a bit duller than some of the cheesy old horror films from the 1950s . I would say that it's more fun than watching ROBOT MONSTER but not quite as much as TEENAGERS FROM OUTER SPACE . The film is about , you guessed it , a giant gila monster that terrorizes a small town . One by one , it causes auto and train wrecks and then feasts on the inhabitants ! While this all sounds very ridiculous and funny , the film actually plays most of the plot very straight . However , inexplicably , it also chooses to insert a lot of 50s rock and roll into the film - - even at moments where it makes absolutely no sense at all . For example , near the end of the movie the sheriff finally realizes that the accidents were being caused by the giant lizard but doesn't warn anyone . So , naturally , the teenagers stage a big dance right where the gila monster resides . But to make things worse , even though many people have just died , the lead actor begins to sing ( a la Arch Hall , Jr . in EEGAH ! ) ! Huh ? ! About the only decent thing about the plot was the role of the sheriff . Aside from the big brain lapse mentioned above , he seemed like a nice guy and actually liked the teens and listened to them - - not like MOST sheriffs in these sort of movies ( like the cops in THE BLOB and INVASION OF THE SAUCER MEN and countless other films who ignore the warnings ) . Considering how slowly the gila monster moves in the film , it's a great metaphor for the rest of the movie . Not exactly action-packed but still silly enough to provide a few chuckles to bad movie aficionados - - but probably of no interest to others . By the way , in one scene late in the movie , the sheriff and another local jump into the leading man's jalopy . As they pull out , the shadow of the boom microphone is very clearly seen in the foreground . Considering the low budget and lower expectations for this film , it's not too surprising that they didn't edit this out or re-shoot the scene !
not nearly as vile and pointless as I expected	This is one of 50 films that were featured in the book THE FIFTY WORST FILMS OF ALL-TIME by Harry Medved . While this is one of the most brilliant books of this type ever made , on occasion , it discusses movies that aren't truly bad enough to make the top 50 . This movie is one of these movies . While I would agree that it is pretty much crap , it was okay quality crap - - and that's just too good for any book on dreck . While it was true that the movie was pointlessly violent and stupid , there were actually a few moments in watching it that I didn't totally hate it - - though they were greatly overshadowed by the bad ones . Nauseating and over-done scenes involve Warren Oates talking to a disembodied head that is festering as well as many , many slow-motion death scenes - - a Peckinpah trademark that is getting pretty old by this film . I would recommend this movie wholeheartedly to lovers of excessively violent and poorly written , acted and directed films . For all others , particularly kids , old people and the easily nauseated , don't bother . Some movies are simply violent and pointless and this movie certainly qualifies as such a film .
Best avoided .	I must point out that unlike most viewers of the Fairly Odd Parents , I am an adult and am not ashamed to admit I like the show . Thanks to clever writing and unusually good stories with likable characters , this is one kids ' show that parents can not just tolerate but enjoy . Heck , I think I know more about this show than most of my students I teach - - it's just a neat show that doesn't insult the audience's intelligence . Now , in the latest from Nickelodeon , I am now asking myself " how many times can they mess up the Fairly Odd Parents formula until the show is completely unwatchable ? " . Apparently , not too many more times ! After the dreadful Jimmy Neutron / Timmy Turner crossover episodes , a musical movie ( ! ) and now a Fairly Odd baby , I can see that the series has finally " jumped the shark " and is on its last legs . I wish the network would either return to the original formula that made the show great or just end it once and for all . Adding a stupid baby to the show is just the last straw !
sweet little film for 1900 , but an amazingly dull curio when seen today	This is one of those dull little films that impressed audiences in the 1890s but today seems very dull and dated . Grandma and her grandson are using her magnifying glass to look at stuff . They look at each other and they look at the cat . Nothing particularly interesting or compelling . It just goes to show you that life in the " Gay 90s " must have been pretty boring ! ! Today , despite the film's brevity , I can't imagine anyone but a die-hard Cinephile enjoying this clip . I am a history teacher and film lover , but I STILL found this pretty tedious and uninspiring . At the same time this dull stuff was being made , the French director / actor / producer Georges MÃ©liÃ¨s was making some very innovative films with actual plots , sets and amazing camera tricks . Seek out his stuff instead .
I had to watch this one twice to make sure I hadn't missed something . . .	When I looked over the distribution of scores for this film as well as the tremendously glowing review for this independent short , I assumed it was a film of greatness or at least near-greatness . So when I saw the film I was left totally perplexed . Hadn't I just seen a film where , for the most part , a cute dog runs around the apartment doing doggy things . During the film he chews on a shoe and knocks over the garbage and he's an adorable looking dog . However , I have exactly the same thing going on at my house with my dog . He loves garbage and he's very cute , so what's the point ? ! Seeing this is like watching " The Puppy Bowl " on the Animal Planet channel on cable TV . Sure , the camera work is decent but that and a cute dog don't make a story worthy of such accolades . I even watched it twice to make sure I wasn't missing something - - which I apparently wasn't . For die-hard pet lovers only , and I am not talking about the average pet owner but those people who are obsessed with dogs .
a mildly interesting tale about a bunch of people I hate as well as an " agenda film "	I have a standard for films that not every reviewer has , and that is I must find something to connect me with the characters for me to like a film . So , if you don't mind watching a film where most of the people are selfish , hypocritical scum , then you might just like this film . The film , to me , seems like an " agenda film " , just like the more famous Dutch film ANTONIA ( 1995 ) . Both seem to show " normal " straight supposedly monogamous people as generally hypocritical and those with a " new morality " to be superior . Well , at least this film did not have a strong anti-male theme like ANTONIA , but seems to strongly show traditional values as being outmoded . The straight people in the film are either sexually obsessed or frigid , while the gay and bi - characters are shown as being " nice " . Why does this have to be so " black and white " an issue ? In other words , can't films show people as PEOPLE and stop with silly stereotypes . In the old days , gay people were subhuman - - an evil stereotype indeed . Now , the " politically correct " stereotype is that gay people are noble and straights are often narrow-minded hypocrites . Some middle-ground would sure be nice for a change ! Apart from the agenda , the film is reasonably well-acted and technically sound , so it deserves a score of at least 3 . However , parents are strongly warned to either watch this and discuss it with their teens or just let them wait until their adults to see this indoctrination film if they must . Okay , now that I am finished , be sure to give my review a bad rating and send me your hate mail . I really do expect it . To quote Rodney King , my response is " . . can't we just get along ? " .
Bad but VERY watchable	James Best and his friend arrive by boat at a small island in front of a storm . The island is the home to a scientist and his assistants who are working on prolonging life but accidentally create a race of giant shrews ( ? ) . Interestingly enough , these shrews look pretty much like dogs with cheesy costumes when they are shown walking or running , and in closeups they resemble nothing from this planet - - they are just too weird to explain . Although all this was really cheesy , what I thought was funniest was when people were holding normal shrews and playing with them , as in real life , shrews are insane and would have probably torn them to pieces . If you look closely , these are actually mice ( and it's a good thing for the " actors " ) . This is one of 10 movies that come on a public domain DVD collection of horror films . Pretty much all the films stink , but at least this one is very watchable but bad - - sort of like PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE . The campiness and silliness of the whole thing hooked my attention . The acting was generally pretty bad , though Best wasn't too bad . However , if you are NOT a fan of bad but fun movies , avoid the film - - it certainly ISN'T Shakespeare !
an important message tarnished by goofy film techniques	Although the purpose of this film was to denounce the use of nuclear weapons , I so hated the style of the film that the message was largely lost on me . While I loved some of the the director's other works , I was annoyed by the " artsy " tone of the film and the New Wave sensibilities of it . I'll be honest and up front about this - - I hate most of the Godard films I have seen as well as SOME of Truffaut's films ( two of the " gods " of French New Wave cinema ) . Strange camera angles and the avoidance of normal movie conventions may impress some , but I felt lost . I hated the goofy poetry-like dialog that was used while scenes went back and forth between the lovers and documentary footage of the civilians of the Hiroshima post-blast . It seemed to trivialize and muddle the impact of their pain . So why did I give it a 3 and not a 1 ? Well , I have seen a lot of French films and there are some whose level of awfulness reaches far greater heights than this film ( and there are some that are absolute masterpieces ) . If you think this film is bad , try watching Alphaville or Last Night At Marienbad - - now THESE are really bad French films !
An important historical curio , but not an especially fun film to watch	This film is about race hatred . Now in this unique film , it's not just Whites hating Blacks but most of the hatred is from light-skinned Blacks who are passing as White and their hatred for other Black people . This is a rather daring topic , as was having one of these race phonies calling out the KKK on his own people due to his self-hatred ! ! THE SYMBOL OF THE UNCONQUERED sounded like an exciting movie to watch . After all , it was a Black-produced and acted silent film that dealt with the Ku Klux Klan - - how could this turn out to be anything other than exciting ? ! Well , unfortunately , it did - - and not all of this is the fault of writer / director / producer Oscar Micheaux nor his cast . The biggest problem is that even if this was a good film ( which it wasn't ) , major portions of the movie are missing - - having decomposed over time like so many older films made on nitrate stock . And , unfortunately , the most exciting portion , the confrontation with the Klan , is among the portions missing . Because of this , the restored version describes the missing scenes and you are left to imagine what it was like - - making giving this film a numerical score practically impossible . My score is based on two thing - - how enjoyable the viewing experience was ( it wasn't ) and the uniqueness of the plot ( it was ) . The bottom line is that in the portions that are remaining , the acting is rather amateurish and the plot is a bit hard to believe and surprisingly dull . However , it is an interesting historical curio , so some may find it a good film to see - - especially if you want to see what Black-American films were like in the olden days - - though several of Micheaux's other surviving films are better made and more entertaining .
way too " artsy " for its own good	While I have seen and enjoyed similar movies to this one that were silent films about the Russian Revolution , such as POTEMKIN and TEN DAYS THAT SHOOK THE WORLD , I did not particularly enjoy this one . This was mostly due to the annoying and " artsy " way that the director chose to shoot the film . While POTEMKIN excelled in its editing style , this movie used similar techniques with a lot less finesse - - in some places , the editing seemed very choppy and amateurish . Plus , and this was truly annoying , the use of zombies throughout the beginning of the film and late in the film really was over-the-top . What I mean by " zombies " is that to illustrate just how depressed and oppressed the Ukranian peasants were , the people stand like mannequins in many scenes . And , they stand like this , unmoving , for a VERY long period of time , while the " evil " Capitalists and exploiters of the masses walk by . Gimme a break ! This movie is a wonderful example of style over substance - - and it's only a movie for those who enjoy or can overlook the overindulgent direction . By the way , the DVD for this film is improved , somewhat , if you leave the audio commentary on . This makes the movie easier to follow and gives a few interesting insights .
as long as you ignore history and reality , this is a fine movie	This is just the sort of Hollywood epic that makes US History teachers have strokes when they watch them ! Although there has been a long history of playing fast and loose with the facts , this is probably the WORST big budget historical film from Warner Brothers . And this is sad because the same studio produced many exceptional films based on real characters and events ( such as Dr . Ehrlich's Magic Bullet ) . BUT , because it has a lot of good actors ( such as Errol Flynn , Ronald Reagan and many others ) it gets a score of 3 . So WHAT was wrong with the movie historically ? Well , pretty much everything . All the great generals of the Civil War make appearances in this movie which is set before the war - - even though some would have only been children at the time ( and they are portrayed as adults ) and many of them never even met in real life . In the movie , they are like a big frat house where everybody knows and loves everybody else . And the events in the movie are so histrionic and silly . My advice is only see this if you are a die-hard fan OR if you hate your history teacher's guts and WANT to give him or her a stroke when you tell them Warner Brothers ' version of our history .
This showed how much Stan needed Ollie	This film was made long before Stan Laurel was teamed up with Oliver Hardy . This film was made the same year the team's first picture was made ( LUCKY DOG ) , but it was still eight years before they began deliberately putting the two in the same film . Without Oliver Hardy , Stan was a solo act for about a decade . Some of his films , such as DR . PYCKLE AND MR . PRYDE , was exceptionally funny , while many such as HUSTLING FOR HEALTH were rather tedious . The film begins with Stan about to go on vacation . However , he arrives late for the train . A stranger offers to let him come to his house because he'll be able to get all the relaxation he needs there . However , it's soon apparent that this " benefactor " is a jerk and he puts Stan to work around the noisy house . None of the jokes are particularly funny and there seems to be absolutely no reason for Stan to stay in this place . In fact , the film might best be described as tedious - - which is very sad as I love silent comedy and most of the films of Stan Laurel .
Campy but enjoyable early sci-fi	The film begins with people on Earth discovering that their rocket to Mars had not been lost but was just drifting out in Space near out planet . When it's retrieved , one of the crew members is ill , one is alive and the other two are missing . What happened to them is told through a flashback by the surviving member . While on Mars , the crew was apparently attacked by a whole host of very silly bug-eyed monsters . Oddly , while the sets were pretty good , the monsters were among the silliest I have seen on film . Plus , in an odd attempt at realism , the production used a process called " Cinemagic " . Unfortunately , this wonderful innovation just made the film look pretty cheap when they were on the surface of Mars AND the intensity of the redness practically made my eyes bleed - - it was THAT bad ! ! Despite all the cheese , the film did have a somewhat interesting plot as well as a good message about space travel . For lovers of the genre , it's well worth seeing . For others , you may just find the whole thing rather silly - - see for yourself and decide . While by today's standards this isn't an especially good sci-fi film , compared with the films being made at the time , it stacks up pretty well . PS - - When you watch the film , pay careful attention to Dr . Tremayne . He looks like the spitting image of Dr . Quest from the " Jonny Quest " cartoon ! Plus , he sounds and acts a lot like him , too .
A wartime misfire	This is an odd movie for several reasons . First , it stars Cary Grant and Ginger Rogers - - a combination that just didn't seem to work very well . Second , despite Hollywood formula , Ginger marries another man towards the beginning of the film and later runs off with Grant when she finally realizes he's a Nazi shnook ! The problem , though , is that the film just seemed pretty limp and Ginger's overwrought acting didn't seem to help . It was a movie clearly intended to boost the war effort , but just didn't seem to gel into a coherent or even semi-believable film . All-in-all , one of the few misfires of Cary Grant's career and a film well worth skipping and only for his devoted fans .
NOT really a Laurel and Hardy film	While this technically IS a Laurel and Hardy film , to me it is more of a film that just happens to have both the actors in the same film . Many of their earlier films just didn't have much chemistry between them and the familiar relationship between the boys just isn't right ! Normally , Stan and Ollie were friends and despite their problems , you knew they really cared about each other . However , here they both come to a fancy party as fill-in help but just because they come in together , they really don't seem like pals and there is little character development . Plus , the behaviors of Stanley in particular just seem bizarre and he takes too many pratfalls . So the bottom line is that the chemistry just isn't right between them and the film is very unfamiliar in mood or humor . Despite these weaknesses , this is an interesting film from a historical point of view . The problem is , it just isn't funny . A great example of this is the repeated scene where a female party guest is trying to eat a grape . As she tries to scoop it up with a spoon , it keeps eluding her . Again and again and again they cut back to this as if it was somehow funny or clever . It wasn't .
Strong on atmosphere , the script seemed hopelessly muddled	Despite not having an especially good script , the movie earns a 5 just because director Robson and producer Lewton did a great job in creating a spooky and tense atmosphere . Unfortunately , the film never delivered - - allowing the tension to build but ultimately fizzle due to a very poor script - - at least when compared to other Val Lewton films . In fact , when you hear Lewton is involved with a film , you assume it will be a top-notch B film which will make the most of its low budget - - this one certainly didn't . The film is essentially about young Kim Hunter leaving her school to look for her missing sister . This was done very poorly , as the sister popped into an early scene for a few seconds , so you KNEW she wasn't dead - - taking away much of the mystery . Then , when you discover she isn't involved with an evil devil cult , you are never titillated or scared , as these devil-lovers NEVER do anything to kill anyone ! ! They ask and beg people to do things , but these super-polite folks never get around to doing anything menacing ! ! It was almost like making the film THE OMEN and having it written by Pat Boone ! Where is the payoff ? ! Additionally , some story elements simply make no sense at all - - such as Hugh Beaumont never mentioning to Hunter when they meet or for some time after that he is married to Hunter's sister ! And , when totally out of left field , it is announced that Beaumont is now in love with Hunter ! ! Where did THIS plot element come from anyway ? ! And , to top it off , right after he declares his love to Hunter , in a separate part of town , the sister is seen killing herself - - thus freeing Hunter and Beaumont to marry ! Talk about a contrived script ! So overall , the lighting , music and mood were very effective . Too bad there was absolutely no payoff and as a result this is a sub-par Val Lewton film . How , with all its logical errors and a poor payoff in the end , could ANYONE score this film a 10 is beyond me , though several have . This is definitely a case of style over substance .
Obviously a stage production brought to the screen	This obviously must have been a play first , as the film is very static and spends most of the time confined to small sets . I really wish the writers had done something to try to open the film up a bit - - giving it some more energy and giving it life . Instead , you feel you are watching a play that was filmed - - especially when it comes to dialog , as the actors seem to be , at times , making speeches to an audience . Now the acting is okay ( though a bit too earnest if you ask me ) and the general idea is okay , but just not super-compelling . You see , a young couple is married and face a huge battle against debts and struggle to get by - - - again and again and again . Halfway into the film , I felt like I'd had enough . Yes , they were young and in love but the day to day pressures put a lot of strain on their marriage - - I understood that but after a while I just wanted this depressing film to end . About the only bright spot was the role played by Claude Rains - - he was pretty funny and likable . As for the leads , Anne Shirley and John Garfield , this was definitely not one of their better films as they came off as rather whiny and immature . I just felt like yelling at the actors to buck up and deal with it - - that's life !
little of the Laurel and Hardy magic	While this isn't a bad film , it certainly isn't one of the team's better efforts . It's a shame really , as 1929 to the mid 30s was the absolute prime period of their work together . I guess considering all the great films they made , it's okay to have a bit of a let-down , . . . and that's exactly what this is . The routines are not especially funny and the same type things had been done before by them with better results . Stan and Ollie are a Vaudeville team catching a train to their next gig . They have trouble locating each other at the station and Ollie loses his papers from his suitcase in this opening scene - - not terribly funny stuff at all . Then , on the train , two main comedy bits are used . The first involves people grabbing and ripping each other's clothes . This has been done before and the set up for this wasn't very smooth or believable - - people just start doing it for apparently no reason at all . Next , Stan and Ollie must both climb into an upper sleeping berth designed for one . This seems to take forever and is frankly stretched too long . Really , now that I think about it , this movie was a pleasant enough short but really had no laughs . PS - - you can tell , in spots , that this film was originally a silent film or that they were unfamiliar with making sound films , as the sound is absent in some of the early scenes or seem tacked on . This isn't as bad or noticeable as in many early sound films , but if you look you'll notice .
excellent until a completely unsatisfying ending	This movie really got me hooked . The plot about an unhappy women who goes to see the same escapist film again and again is charming - - particularly when the characters in the movie begin to notice that she keeps coming back again and again ! Ultimately , the hero of the movie is so taken by her devotion , that he literally walks out of the picture to meet her and then refuses to go back ! This is WONDERFUL and surreal . It got even better when all the other characters just stood by and waited and waited for him to return and finally didn't know what to do with themselves ! ! This was great . Then , for some odd reason ( not that it wasn't already odd ) , the movie could NEVER end until he returned and they couldn't show any movies until this was resolved . I was THRILLED and up until the end , this may have been my favorite Woody Allen movie . Unfortunately , the same sweetness that had prevailed throughout most of the movie completely disappeared at the end . Instead of the expected ending , it provided a " life stinks " ending and completely ruined the experience for me . In fact , I think the movie ended on a rather cruel note .
Cute and pleasant but too much singing by Kathryn Grayson ! !	This is one of those films that is best enjoyed by just turning off your brain and letting yourself get into the film despite a very silly and impossible plot . Considering the film has considerable charm ( and Cuddles Sakal ) , I could do this quite easily - - at least until Kathryn Grayson sang too many songs that it spoiled mood ! While I am not a huge fan of musicals , this isn't exactly a musical as all the numbers are strictly Grayson singing in a very operatic style that you either love or hate - - guess which category I fell into ! The silly plot is about the fictional town of New Delph , Michigan - - and I assume it's a thinly disguised version of Holland , Michigan , as this town is famous for their bulbs and Dutch heritage . The town is like a little piece of Holland transported to America , as the homes look very Dutch and they keep alive their heritage through cultural festivals . Van Heflin is a reporter and arrives for the annual Tulip Festival . The first person he meets is the odd but very sweet Cuddle Sakal who runs the local hotel . The hotel is staffed by his seven daughters - - all who have boys ' names ! And , of course , all are very beautiful and charming ( with one exception ) . Van falls for the youngest one ( Grayson ) but the family tradition is that none of them can marry until the oldest marries ( Marsha Hunt ) . Unfortunately , Hunt is a rather vain and obnoxious lady and Heflin is stuck because he wants to wed Grayson and break the very strong family tradition . The whole contrived plot works because of the charming nature of the film . Sakal , as usual , is a cute and endearing character and the film is well-written ( at least when it comes to dialog ) . About the only deficits are the silliness of the plot and the over-abundance of singing by Grayson . Without the singing , this film would have earned at least a 7 !
A cute little film from a Canadian art student	The film begins with an archer on a tiny planet shooting at a bird . The short is errant and starts a chain of unexpected results . Isn't it amazing these days how even college students can produce exceptional animated films thanks to amazing and readily available rendering software and extremely high-powered home computers ? Just a few years before EL ARQUERO , such a film only would have been impossible - - especially for a struggling student . In recent years , however , many lovely CG films have been produced by film students in dozens of schools around the world . While not among the very best of these I have seen , it sure is good and very impressive considering Raphael Perkins ' lack of experience .
Pretty good , but a step below average for the team	The film begins with a judge ( played by perennial Laurel and Hardy supporting player , James Finlayson ) sentencing a mad killer to death . However , the maniac escapes and vows revenge on the judge . Wisely , the judge hires some private detectives to protect him - - but unfortunately it's Stan and Ollie ! They spend much of the film trying to nab the killer or running to avoid his enormous knife . 1927 was a very busy year for Laurel and Hardy - - having made about a dozen films together . Up until the end of 1927 , they were still not officially a team and their roles and chemistry seem very odd in these films compared to later Laurel and Hardy films . While DO DETECTIVES THINK ? is much closer to the Stan and Ollie style than the previous films , the boys still aren't what many might expect . First , Stan is the smarter of the two , and second , the film is much more like a traditional slapstick film . Instead of friendship binding them , Ollie shoves and slaps Stan again and again as the film tries harder to get cheap laughs than to build chemistry . As a result , when the going gets tough , it's " every man for himself " - - an attitude that you wouldn't have seen so strongly in later films . Still , it is very watchable and funny - - too bad it lacks the chemistry that later made them so lovable . A good but not great early effort .
Completely ridiculous but oddly likable - - despite the " I hate Gypsies " message !	This is NOT the first anti-Gypsy film I saw by D . W . Griffith . It seems that in addition to hating Blacks , Griffith wasn't very partial to Gypsies and portrayed them as lying thieves in his films . In one case , it involved a lying fortune-teller that was trying to climb inside Mary Pickford's dress in WHAT THE DAISY SAID , and in this case , it involves evil Gypsies trying to kidnap our kids ! ! ! Wow . The story begins with a Gypsy attacking some people . Why ? I dunno . But after getting a thrashing , he steals a family's kid and stuffs her into a barrel . So far , the movie is bad . But , once she's in the barrel , the movie gets pretty funny - - but I doubt if that was necessarily the intention . Either way , it's a short and interesting historical curio .
Good but perhaps overrated	I have seen a lot of rave reviews over the years about this 70s Film Noir-inspired film starring Walter Mathau . And , while I admit it's a pretty good film , I don't understand why some of the big-name film critics in this country are so gung-ho about it . Compared to traditional Noir , this film isn't all that great and for a more modern caper , there are better films . Perhaps the best aspect of the film is Mathau . This isn't necessarily for his performance but his look - - he just looks so much different than the stereotypical crook looks in film . Plus , there is a decent amount of action and suspense to keep you interested - - just don't expect too much from this film . I know I did and was disappointed .
Meh .	This is a decent Looney Tunes cartoon that somehow managed to be nominated for an Oscar . While this made little sense , there was some justice in life as the wonderful DER FUEHRER'S FACE from Disney took the actual award . I think part of the reason I am less than thrilled with this cartoon is that I couldn't help think of two main problems . One , the 1933 Disney version of the Three Pigs was a much , much better tale - - with better laughs and much better animation . The story here in PIGS IN A POLKA just seemed like a copy . Two , while this is a pleasant cartoon , compared to the other toons being made by Warner Brothers at the time , this is pretty limp . I'd much rather have seen Daffy Duck or the Studio's latest creation , Bugs Bunny , instead of seeing these pigs dancing to Brahms ' " Hungarian Dances " . Overall , good but far from great . If you are looking for it yourself , I suggest you buy the Looney Tunes Golden Collection and avoid the version I saw . I saw it on a DVD entitled " Cartoon Crazys : And The Envelope Please " . This is a rather poor compilation of supposedly award winning and nominated films . Poor because several of the films are very lame and are NOT award nominated , the prints are rather bad and parts of some of the cartoons are missing ! In the case of PIGS IN A POLKA and THE DOVER BOYS cartoons , the entire opening and closing is missing - - and you'd never know they were Looney Tunes cartoons ! While these cartoons both have lapsed into the public domain , clipping the cartoons like this and not acknowledging the people who made this is just plain sleazy .
Pretty good , but I wanted to hear more about Elsa's life	This is an independent short that I assume was made by on of Elsa's children or grandchildren . She was an immigrant from Germany to the US at the end of WWII and she very , very briefly talks about this . Most of the film , however , is not spent reminiscing about Germany , the war or adapting to life in America . Instead , Elsa talks through how to make an American dish ( apple pie ) step by step . While I found her very engaging and it looked like a nice pie ( though I like mine without raisins ) , I also felt frustrated because this lady had so much knowledge and important memories and instead of imparting them , it looked more like a cooking show . My advice to the film's maker , Tim Duquette , is to make more films with her - - but please let her just talk about her life . Sure , I understand that the pie is a metaphor for her life , but since she is in her 70s it certainly would be interesting to chronicle her life for posterity . Just my two cents worth .
While not among the best Falcon films , this one is pretty good and worth a look	For my time , I would much rather watch an earlier Falcon film . That's because the George Sanders films were usually better written and more exciting - - as well as starred the wonderful Sanders . With THE FALCON'S BROTHER , Sanders ' real-life brother , Tom Conway , took over the leading role since Sanders wanted out of the series in order to pursue other acting opportunities . Now this was a very logical choice , as Conway looked a lot like Sanders and also had a similar lovely melodious voice . But despite this , I still found myself missing Sanders , as to me he was THE Falcon and the earlier films were just were written better and seemed so much fresher . By 1944 , Conway's Falcon had fallen into a rather predictable pattern that must have worked well at the time because they made so many of these films during a three year stretch - - a HUGE output of 9 films ! The public loved them and the series was more popular than contemporaries Boston Blackie , The Lone Wolf and Crime Doctor . So , despite my complaints , the series did work . Of course , I would contend that averaging three films a year was exactly why the films seemed not quite as good as the earlier ones - - they were rushed into production and didn't seem as smooth or engaging as earlier ones . Now THE FALCON IN Mexico is a bit better than most films of this period thanks to a relatively simple but engaging mystery . A low-point in the series was THE FALCON OUT WEST and I think most of the problem with that film was that there were too many twists and turns and surprises . Plus putting Conway out West just didn't fit his style and personality , though Mexico seemed a much better change of venues . The plot involves the possibility that a famous dead painter MIGHT actually be alive . Either that , or the damsel in distress is losing her mind , as she keeps thinking she's seen her dead father . The Falcon , naturally , comes to her aid and by the end the mystery's all naturally been revealed .
okay . . . . just okay	I think a major problem with me watching this film is that the character Tarzan has been done so many times that I frankly am pretty tired of him . He's been in 1001 films and at this point , what is there to add to the story that hasn't already been said ? Generally , this movie seems to say " nothing " . The addition of " cool " gorilla playmates wasn't enough to invigorate the series and as a result of such familiarity of the content , the film is just a very well-made time-passer . Sure , it's very good technically and my kids enjoyed it , but the film has very little lasting appeal . I've been to The Magic Kingdom dozens of times and apart from just after the film debuted , there is almost no reference to it - - nothing . And I think this says a lot about this adequate film .
Hmmm . . . and nobody has yet reviewed this short film ? !	I am very surprised that no one has yet reviewed this film . While I was somewhat ambivalent about it , I guess I'll be the first . Mr . Goldframe is a movie mogul who must do everything better than anyone else . In an odd little battle of one-upsmanship , he has a battle with his own shadow because he can't stand the idea of ANYONE being as good as him - - even his shadow . So , in a contest , he tries to see if he can move faster than and better than the shadow . This film is animated using black pencils , but this works out very well - - with nice detail and enough to make it interesting . While the overall product is watchable , this isn't a film to get too excited about , as it's so short and the ending is only mildly satisfying .
While clever , it's hard to really like Grant or Bergman in this film	This film was a pretty big risk for Ingrid Bergman to take . About a decade earlier , her very public affair with Roberto Rossellini temporarily damaged her career . Because of this , it seems pretty surprising that in this film she'd play a woman who knowingly has an affair with a supposedly married man . Oddly , however , despite this being an affair , the film seems to imply that they never get around to actually committing adultery ! They spend lots of time together and whisper sweet nothings to each other , but their relationship seems sex-less ! I'm sure this would have been handled very differently if it were made today . As for the rest of the film , it tries very hard to be a romance - - with excellent music and cinematography to set the mood . The problem is for me , adultery ( or " near-adultry " like in this film ) is a MAJOR turnoff ! You can't get past the fact that Ingrid and Cary seem like very selfish people . Later , however , in a very , very bizarre plot twist , you find out that there is a lot more to the affair than meets the eye . What exactly this is and how the film then becomes a bit more of a romantic-comedy is just something you'll have to see for yourself . The bottom line is that this is a pretty agreeable time-passer but also NOT one of the stars ' better films . Call me old fashioned ( which I am ) , but selfish and slutty appearing behavior is not compatible with romance .
well-made Japanese flick that could have used more energy	This is a gorgeous film to watch - - you probably will never see a more beautiful view of Japan as you see of the wonderful cherry blossoms or Japanese Maples around Kyoto and Osaka . So , the cinematography is excellent . However , the story itself seemed awfully flat overall . The writing and acting was decent , but the film needed more energy , heart and a sense of humor for me to care more about the characters . Most of the characters would have surely benefited from a massive dose of this , as the way they were portrayed it was , at times , hard to for me to care about them or sustain my interest in the film . For example , the 3rd daughter ( who was the one who repeatedly refused marriage proposals ) was a bit of a cipher , as she didn't say very much and just used a lot of facial expressions instead of dialog . The youngest , though a little self-destructive , was probably the easiest to like or at least understand . And the two older sisters were very domineering but needed to be softened a little more - - lest they seem too one-dimensional . A decent film , but that's all .
Considering its modest budget and lack of pretense , it's a pretty good little film	This is a cute and watchable little film from MGM . Considering that it had none of the huge stars like many of its films , it is surprisingly fun and worth seeing - - and I almost scored this a 7 . Dennis Morgan , Thomas Mitchell and Priscilla Lane are the stars and while I wasn't surprised to hear Mitchell's excellent Irish accent , I was surprised that Morgan did the Scotish accent as well as he did . The story itself is an interesting slice of life about retiring cop Mitchell . He didn't know he was about to lose his job and initially this throws him for a loop , as he loves his job - - it is his life . And , he also blames Morgan for this because this young cop actually gets Mitchell's job ! What happens next is something I'll leave up to you - - I'd hate to spoil the movie . But , the big characters and the whole mood of the film is infectious - - just turn off your brain and enjoy !
Too short and kind of pointless . . . . but still fun !	A guy has a breakdown in his car and hitches a ride with some hippies . The hippies are nice , but also really dumb and completely out of it ! In the end , the guy demands they let him out , as he can't take any more of their pointless optimism and creepy ways ! This short film is really way too short - - especially on plot . However , despite having just the tiniest thread of a story , it still was worth a look because it was fun watching the guy getting a lift getting angry ! No matter what he said , the hippies were so dippy and hyper-happy that he kept getting more and more frustrated at them . No particular point - - just a short-tempered guy getting really annoyed at these very annoying folks ! It made me laugh , but overall it didn't seem like a real film - - just a funny moment clipped from a film or TV show . Still , it did make me laugh and sometimes that's just enough .
Decent , but I wasn't as bowled over by it	This is a short film that I wasn't planning on reviewing . However , after seeing only one other review ( and one so very , very positive ) , I thought I'd throw in my two cents worth , so to speak . While I did not dislike the film , I wasn't nearly as impressed - - especially since I have seen so many other short films lately . Compared to others , this one is pretty good but certainly not outstanding - - at least as far as the plot goes . It just seemed incomplete and unsatisfying to deserve such praise - - unless you like the direction the plot goes . I am not into the supernatural in general , so this might account for my feelings about it . Anne Rice fans and fans of TWILIGHT will no doubt love it . However , one thing I really did like was the look of the film - - the costumes , the funkadelic early 1970s look that is very eye-catching . The director and set designers did a great job and made the movie ( complete with fake age marks on the film ) look like a blast from the past . Overall , a decent film and I am left wanting to see more from the team that made it .
I should be ashamed of myself , but this film actually made me laugh	Norm MacDonald and Artie Lange play two friends who aren't particularly bright and have a long history of screwing up their lives and losing jobs . Then they get the bright idea of opening up their own business - - one that will get revenge for a price . The acts of revenge are among the funniest things about the film . I especially loved how he got revenge on the loud neighbors and the sleazy car salesman . There were some serious negatives in the film such as quite a few flat jokes here , the unfunny bit where MacDonald makes notes to himself on a tape recorder ( it was overdone on SNL - - it was even worse here ) and there was the ending - - it seemed to end way too quickly and the resolution wasn't particularly satisfying compared to the earlier parts of the film . However , this film has the phrase " guilty pleasure " written all over it . While the film has many flat moments , crude jokes and horrible messages , it did make me laugh and laugh - - and that's the most important positive about the film . I know I should be ashamed of myself , but you can't ignore a film that puts a smile on your face like this stupid movie did . In addition , I hate to admit that I also laughed at MacDonald's other critically scathed film SCREWED . I feel so dirty - - these are NOT deep or sophisticated films and they abound with juvenile humor - - but they make me laugh . By the way , keep note of all the unusual supporting actors that appeared in this film such as Chevy Chase , Don Rickles , Adam Sandler , Chris Farley and Jack Warden ( among others ) . Obviously , there were a lot of folks out there that liked MacDonald and wanted to help him with this film .
mediocre eye candy	This movie should not have won the Oscar for Best Picture . The fact that it did was either because it was a very bad year for movies ( in which case , I don't think an award should be given for this category ) or the academy , once again , voted for a bloated MEGA-picture despite it being sterile ( there are MANY worse examples of this - - think of The English Patient or The Last Emporer ) . While I don't think it was even close to Oscar material , I also think a few reviews on this site are too harsh as well . Giving this picture a " 1 " ? Nope . This isn't fair , as the music and photography were great . I loved the African singing and the scene of the biplane flying over the flock of flamingos in incredible . So , the final verdict : dull and unlikeable characters , a script that reads like fiction ( not the real life story ) , unconvincing dialog BUT a treat for the eyes and ears . So my advice is to turn off your brain and enjoy - - particularly on the big screen .
The most embarrassing Christmas ever ! !	This is one of many newer independent shorts that have been posted on IMDb for viewing in the States . Hopefully , the problem with international rights can be worked out and it will be shown abroad . One important thing to note is that this short , while funny , is NOT for children ! ! The humor is very crude and shouldn't even been seen by teens due to its over sexual nature . Two teens are celebrating Christmas . After they exchange presents , the girl suggests they REALLY celebrate and she gives him a condom . They are engaging in sex ( though no nudity is seen on screen ) when her father comes into the room to watch TV . Eventually , he fortunately leaves and the couple quickly try to hide the evidence of their tryst and so it would seem . . . . until the crude finale . As I indicated , this is an adult film . The production is quite competent and fun to watch - - and very , very crude . Don't say I didn't warn you !
So very , very different from the Hollywood film	This movie is a ripoff of James Cain's novel , THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE . Apparently , the director and producer never bothered to pay for rights to this story - - perhaps the fact that we were in the middle of fighting the Italians in WWII might account for their forgetting to consider royalties ! Despite this , the movie isn't really just an Italian version of the Hollywood movie . In some ways it's a lot better and in other ways , it is definitely not . The three central characters in this movie are really pretty ugly people . In fact , the male and female lovers are a bit icky-looking . The male lead is pretty ordinary except for his profuse body hair ( particularly on the back and shoulders ) and his lady love is , to put it frankly , unattractive . They are a very , very far cry from Lana Turner and John Garfield in the Hollywood version . And the ill-fated husband is really , really obese and loves to walk around shirtless - - and his counterpart in the American film , Cecil Kellaway is definitely better looking ( and probably better looking than the other two Italian leads , actually ) . And this unattractiveness is generally a reason I actually preferred the Italian film - - since I just could NOT imagine a finely coiffed " dish " like Lana Turner in the middle of nowhere married to Kellaway - - I am 100 % sure she would have had dozens of better offers ! Whereas , the Italian wife frankly might NOT have been able to do much better and this made the marriage actually believable . Part of the Italian film's believability comes from the blunt way it handles sex . The sanitized American film tries to make you believe that although Turner and Garfield kill Kellaway , they never actually get around to sex ! This is pretty silly and totally unrealistic . In addition to the casual sexuality of the film , it's also pretty casual in showing the seamy side of life - - with lots of sweaty people , a fly strip hanging over the kitchen table and everyone appeared to need a bath . The movie is also pretty fast-paced compared to the over-long American film . And what you get due to brevity isn't all good . The film lacks a lot of the style and polish of the American film - - with grainier footage , relatively poor orchestration and sets . It sure ain't a pretty film , but the Neo-Realistic-like style makes the film seem more realistic . But it cannot make up for the short-cuts in the plot . Many of the plot elements in the later American version are either missing entirely or glossed over . And the ending seems a lot less interesting than the American film - - and misses the entire human nature dilemma when Turner and Garfield turn on each other like rats ( the best part of the American film ) . So which is the better film ? Well , a lot of this probably depends on you . As for me , the Warner Brothers film was simply too polished and too unrealistic ( though many like this style and may dislike watching films with subtitles ) - - but it packed a great ending . And the Italian film was much , much more realistic - - until the crappy ending that seemed too rushed . So neither film is exactly great , but I'd give my nod to the Italian one being a bit better . It's too bad they couldn't have combined the best elements of both films into one exceptional film .
a very well done film but what a downer !	The writing , acting and direction are wonderful in this film . I simply can't find fault with the quality of the film . However , like a few other comments here on IMDb , I found this film depressing and difficult to watch . However , that isn't all bad - - such a film can also get you to think . After all , nearly half of all marriages end in divorce so it's good to see someone attempting to broach the topic of a failed marriage ! But , I am afraid that many who view the film could easily take the attitude that infidelity is inevitable ( especially since the featured couple is so " civilized " about adultery ) . Of course , it also is very possible that the movie COULD be a warning that advises us not to be stuck in sick roles within a marriage but deal more openly and truthfully . Who knows . at least it made me think .
Pretty good - - what a lovely brother ! !	This is an interesting little film , though I sure wish it were a bit longer since I enjoyed it so much . A bum is in a bar trying to gather enough money for his next drink . Then , unexpectedly , a stranger comes in and buys him a drink and befriends him . Soon , you see that the stranger looks almost like the bum and he takes him home and cleans him up , feeds him and treats him like he's a part of the family - - which you assume he is since they look so much alike . However , all this kindness comes with a price - - leading you to see the " nice " brother as a true jerk ! Interestingly , the two leads probably are brothers - - as they have the same last name and look virtually alike . Overall , it's a very good film with good production values and a nice creepy story .
very good wartime drama	This is a very good , though a tad predictable wartime film . This is because although more than half of the crew members are killed , you can pretty much expect that ONLY those you don't recognize will be the ones to " buy the farm " . Noel Coward , John Mills and Richard Attenborough are among the crew , and as I said , you KNOW they will survive because they are big-time actors ( though at this point , Mills and Attenborough were at the beginning of their film careers ) . This reminded me of the original Star Trek series - - you knew Kirk , Scotty , McCoy and Spock were going to live but you could pretty much guarantee that one of the " red shirts " would be killed ! In addition , though the film is much better than average compared to other WWII war films , I don't agree that it is THAT much better than average as SOME of the portrayals are clearly too good to be true because this was intended as propaganda . However , I was intrigued that Attenborough's character reacted cowardly at one point in the movie and this DID elevate this movie above the average war film because of added realism .
Very good for 1905	This is an interesting little film that , for 1905 , is pretty good but for today's audiences it's mostly only of historical value . It excels because the film has a plot and pacing and some decent action ( at times ) for the times . Sure , the film isn't exactly LASSIE , but it's pretty good fare for 1905 . The film is about a baby-napping and the faithful Collie who comes to the child's rescue ! The problem for me , though , is that although I am a real Cinephile and love historical films , the quality of this film doesn't come close to the really wonderful short films Georges MÃ©liÃ¨s was making at the same time - - with great camera tricks , better and more interesting plots and are much more entertaining today .
Quality-wise this isn't up to movies 1 , 2 or 4 , but it's still a must for fans	Okay , by now the series had just about run its course and it was obvious that it would be concluding soon . However , there was one final film for the original series to go and they actually managed to come up with a credible reason for a followup . It was NOT so easy to make movie # 3 , as the Earth had just blown up and no logical reason could resurrect the series ( so , in the 3rd film , they came up with a totally illogical reason ! ) . This film was set only a few years after the fourth film , CONQUEST OF THE PLANET OF THE APES . Unexpectedly , the new society that Caesar set up after the last film was pretty egalitarian and the humans were not all confined to become slaves - - though there were a lot of rumblings from the gorillas who for some odd reason carried a grudge after being tortured and enslaved by the humans ! One serious flaw with the film , though , is that although this only takes place perhaps a decade later , all the apes are civilized and can talk , use guns , etc . as well as any of the humans ! I am a school teacher and I only PRAY that I get students this smart ! ! Anyways , back to the review . It turns out that although this society is functioning pretty well , not all the humans have fallen to the apes . Nope . Ignorant and nihilistic humans STILL hold out hopes of wiping out the basically decent apes and re-asserting mankind's hold over the planet . Well , without getting into the complex plot , the film boils down to a final battle with the bad humans . The apes win , but in the process the evilness of the gorillas is exposed , as they murder Caesar's son ! It seemed the bad gorillas SHOULD have teamed up with the bad humans after all ! ! The film concludes leaving the viewer to ponder what will become of the perfect ape society - - will it actually degenerate to what it would become in movie # 1 or would all the positive changes in this movie avert that awful future and the destruction of the Earth ? ! ? I guess we'll never know . The first time I saw this movie , I didn't like it very much . However , in seeing it again , it had a good plot , acting and was a worthy conclusion to the series . A few points in conclusion : it was cool to see the singer Paul Williams as an ape in this movie ( it probably took less make-up than usual ) , there was a short-lived TV series that followed , and if anyone thinks the remake from 2001 was great is an idiot .
A very good WWII drama	While some aspects of this film seem a tad hokey , overall it's a very good and enjoyable film and I am sure it did a lot to shore up support at home for the war effort . As the film begins , there's a rag-tag group of American , British and Dutch soldiers fighting off the Japanese attack in the Pacific . The new leader of this group asks for a pilot to volunteer for what probably is a suicide mission - - there is only one flyable plane left and he's to use it against a major Japanese attack . All the American pilots quickly volunteer but the Captain ( Franchot Tone ) is chosen because of his bravery and because he has a crazy idea he can rig up a bomb to his Seversky P-35 fighter and attack the nearby Japanese aircraft carrier . Considering that by the time this film was made the P-35 was an obsolete plane , it was indeed a fools errand . After Tone leaves , the five five remaining officers talk about what sort of man Tone was and what may have led to his volunteering for such a mission . So Tone's unusual story is told through a series of rather interesting flashbacks . In the end , Tone attacks the carrier and fights off Japanese planes that in midair mysteriously turn into British Spitfires ( due to a poor use of stock footage - - a common problem in films of this era ) . And considering that it's a wartime propaganda film , it's almost a foregone conclusion what happens next - - though it is still a very tense and exciting portion of the film . Overall , this is a better than average war film with decent enough action , but more importantly a good story to support it .
Super-duper important to the history of cinema	While aesthetically this film leaves a lot to be desired , for 1910 it's actually a very good film with decent special effects . Sure , if made just a decade later the film would have been A LOT better , but for 1910 it's just fine . And it's super important to the history of film as this recently re-discovered film is the earliest horror film known . For that reason alone it is a great and super important film . Unfortunately , I knew that the story itself would be a problem when the movie began because it said it was a " liberal interpretation " of the original Mary Shelley story . In other words , it bore almost no similarity to the story ! This unfortunately set the pattern that has persisted and the central message to the book is completely forgotten ! As an interpretation of a literary classic , it truly stinks ! The " monster " in the story originally was probably the doctor himself and the creation was evil only as a result of many stupid choices made by the doctor .
It manages to make a seemingly mundane game seem a bit more interesting	Is this a great documentary or one that will change your life ? Nope . However , it manages to do what any decent documentary does - - makes the topic seem more exciting and important . While I have absolutely no interest in Bingo , I found myself watching and actually enjoying the film - - showing that the film makers have a lot of talent . What I especially appreciated about the film was the nice accompanying music and the amazingly diverse locations . Much of it was filmed all over the United States ( including a " Gay Bingo Game " ) , but quite a bit was also filmed in Britain and Ireland . About the only deficit I saw in the film is because the locales changed so much and so often , it was difficult to connect with most of the players - - though this wasn't a serious problem since you got to see such a wide range of folks . Will this be a film that appeals to everyone - - absolutely not ! But for documentary fiends like me , it hit the spot .
I got drug along , but it wasn't bad	Okay , I'll admit that if I didn't have kids , I never would have seen this film and would never see it . But , considering all the rotten kids movies I have seen ( such as SPY KIDS 2 or BABE : PIG IN THE CITY ) , this is a significant improvement . And , it had enough in it that I wasn't totally bored out of my skull or contemplated suicide ( something I did repeatedly in the other two movies ) . Sure , the performances are pretty broad and the plot is kinda silly - - but it IS a kids film . And , compared with other films in the genre , this is definitely better than average . Frankie Muniz and Amanda Bines actually appear to have some talent and probably will continue to have careers after puberty - - at least on infomercials or doing voice-overs . So , if you are looking for a film to see with your kids , you certainly could do a lot worse !
first half is pretty dull and the second half is great fun	This WWI comedy stars Charlie Chaplin's half-brother , Syd . Physically , he doesn't look much like him , but with his bushy mustache looks highly reminiscent of the Keystone comedian , Chester Conklin . The first half of the film is very mundane and frankly it bored me . Nothing particularly funny occurred and the plot just seemed stuck . About the only thing that happened was the corporal making life miserable for Syd and his underlings because he was just a power-hungry jerk . Fortunately , towards the middle , it abruptly became extremely funny and I found myself laughing out loud . In fact , my wife came in the room and after a moment or two , she was laughing as well ! So , let's skip talking about the first half except to say that Chaplin in a career private and dislikes his jerk of a corporal , played by Edgar Kennedy . When the movie switches to the show being put on for the troops , it picks up greatly . Seeing one of the guys in drag was cute , and Syd and his buddy dressed in an amazingly articulated horse suit provided a lot of laughs . Unfortunately , the Germans attack during the show and the British troops scatter - - leaving Syd and his buddy stuck in the horse costume and unable to get out in time ! So , they continue to pretend they are a horse . Now this sounds stupid but was made believable because by the time they were discovered , the Germans who saw them were quite drunk ! And it was pretty cute seeing them try to escape - - especially when the horse head fell off and Syd's dog jumped into the costume ( a horse with a dog's head is definitely memorable ) . Later , once they are out of the suit , they attack a couple Germans and steal their uniforms . They then discover the German's plan to evacuate the town for the British and leave it booby-trapped to blow up ! They also discover that one of the British officers is a German spy . Well , Syd rises to the occasion and the day is miraculously saved . The General is so thrilled that he offers to give Syd ANYTHING he wants , so Syd asks to become a sergeant so he can pay back Edgar Kennedy for all the awful things he did to him in the first part of the film ! The film gets high marks for being entertaining and original . It is a FAR , FAR better film than Buster Keaton's WWI film , DOUGHBOYS and a little better than Laurel and Hardy's PACK UP YOUR TROUBLES ( good film but too much sentimentality ) . PS - - Watch the scene just before Syd dons the horse suit . Watching him packing up chairs is amazing - - such a seemingly mundane task done in such a swift and amazing way .
Let's cram all of Shakespeare's RICHARD III into 22 minutes !	Believe it or not , as of 1911 , this was probably the most in-depth and longest Shakespeare movie made ! However , this STILL is way too short for any of his plays ( even the really bad ones - - take that Shakepeare snobs ! ) and there is no way this film COULD have done the Bard justice even if it had better production values - - 22 minutes is like trying to sum up the Bible in a half an hour ! For 1911 , the sets are pretty good and the length of the film would have made it a full-length film - - as most movies were significantly shorter . Plus , if you had a general idea what the play was about , you could follow along well enough . However , if you are NOT familiar with the play or history ( which , by the way , is a lot different than the way Shakespeare portrayed it ) , then watch this AFTER you read the Cliff Notes - - or better yet , see the TV series BLACK ADDER I ! Otherwise , you'll probably get lost and have no idea what's happening .
Reno is excellent - - the rest of the film is pretty good	This is an interesting film that abruptly changes pace - - something that occasionally pays off well , while other times it doesn't . The film begins with Jean Reno playing a Dirty Harry-type cop in France . His answer to every problem seems to be punching people in the face or shooting them . For some inexplicable reason ( ! ) , his bosses aren't particularly happy with his methods and suspend him . Then , completely out of the blue , he finds out what happened to his long-lost Japanese wife - - she just recently died and her lawyer has contacted Reno about the will . When he arrives in Japan , in addition to being the executor of the will , he also finds out he's been a father for the 19 years since his wife vanished . Now , with a " kooky " new daughter in tow , they are off on some violent adventures . As for the daughter , she was fine later in the film , but at first she really came off as an obnoxious person and it was hard to see how Reno could resist punching her , as well ! Fortunately , this very clichÃ©d bouncy young girl finally began acting believably as the film shifted into overdrive . This shift was when the Yakuza ( like the Japanese mob ) show up and seem eager to kill Reno and his kooky kid ! Throughout all this , Reno is mesmerizing . He's a fine actor and here he carries the entire film . The problem , aside from the distracting girl , is that oddly someone thought it was important to dub this film into English . With Reno , it wasn't so bad - - he did his own dubbing since he speaks English so well . But as for most everyone else , they were lousy voice actors - - most of the Frenchmen sounded just like Americans . Also , it just made no sense why most of the Japanese people spoke English most of the time . As for me , I always prefer a subtitled film . Still , despite these shortcomings , this is a very good action and father-daughter film - - worth your time especially for Reno's seemingly effortless performance .
Pretty good stuff	This is an incredibly simple film . It consists of the camera panning back and forth through a movie theater as the narrator talks about how annoying it is working there . Apparently , there are a lot of highly demanding patrons who REALLY take their movies very seriously - - so seriously that it makes things tough for a working Joe who just wants to do his job . There really isn't anything more to it . And , while simple , the film works because the narration and the narrator's delivery is so good . So good that you really can't help but feel sorry for the guy . Clever and very different - - this is pretty good stuff .
While not a great film , I'd watch it just for Tunde Adebimpe	A while back , I watched a strange but fascinating independent film called JUMP TOMORROW . What I liked most about this film was the strange character played so well by Tunde Adebimpe . His delivery and manner were so nerdy but sweet that you couldn't help but like him - - - even though he was a total dork . So when I found that THE FIRST THREE LIVES OF STUART HORNSLEY was included on a disk of short films from The Film Movement Series , I was excited . Now as far as the film goes , it's not an easy one to get into . The first half or so is very slow and difficult like - - even though , once again , I liked Tunde Adebimpe in the lead role . Still , despite the slowness of the film , stick with it - - the payoff is there and it's worth seeing .
Surprisingly different	Kronos is a surprisingly different sci-fi film from the 1950s . That's because its plot is so unique that it doesn't remind me of any other film of the age - - and that's certainly a reason to recommend it right there . The film begins with a space ship nearing the Earth and a glowing being invading human hosts . It appears to be intelligent , as it seeks out a top man at a government lab . At this same lab , an astronomer sees this ship using their telescopes and he thinks it is some sort of asteroid on a collision course with the planet . Rockets with nuclear warheads are sent to destroy it , but they have no serious effect . Soon , the space object crashes into the ocean . People assume that the possible disaster is averted but this attitude quickly changes when a huge robotic device comes ashore and runs amok . It seems that this is a giant energy collection device and attempts to stop it seem fruitless . Will aliens eventually drain all the energy from our planet and leave it a lifeless hulk or will brainy scientists save the day ? While this film is far more sedate than the usual sci-fi film and the special effects seem rather primitive , the story is clever and involving - - making this a fine sci-fi film for buffs . However , is you don't like this sort of genre , then I also doubt if you'll be as impressed as I was at the effort - - especially since you never really get to see an aliens . By the way , the lead is played by Jeff Morrow - - the same guy who sports a huge bald forehead in THIS ISLAND EARTH . It's pretty obvious when you hear his distinctive voice .
Pretty good , but in season 2 it " jumped the shark "	This was an incredibly ambitious sci-fi series produced in the UK for international distribution . It was extremely expensive for its day and unfortunately , the series never took off due to a Luke-warm reception . Some of this can be blamed on the series itself - - the show had a very sterile look and action was something it was usually lacking . While Martin Landau and Barbara Bain were fine actors , the parts and script were amazingly low-key for the genre . Additionally , had it appeared a few years later , after the sci-fi craze began following STAR WARS , it probably would have fared better . Another problem is that although I enjoyed the show , there were huge changes ( mostly unwelcome ) in the second season . Because the show was struggling in the ratings , huge cast changes were made . The most notable ones were the loss of the wonderful doctor ( played by Barry Morse ) and the introduction of a shape-shifting alien ( Maya ) who seemed rather inappropriate to the style of the show . The intention was to pump some life into it , but devotees of the series like myself were not particularly pleased ) . Overall , there were some amazing episodes ( such as the one about the Queller Drive ) and some bombs . It's a shame , really , as the show deserved to do better than it did .
has some excellent moments	Parts of this movie are great - - particularly those with WC Fields . In particular , I liked the horrible and cowardly way that he dealt with the attack on the train - - pushing hapless little kids with cap guns out the door to face the onslaught ! But , you'll no doubt discover that although this is a WC Fields and Mae West film , they don't interact much together , as they apparently hated each other and had to often be filmed separately . Mae's moments are generally flat compared to Fields ' as she once again plays the trampy old broad who every man MUST possess ( god only knows why ) . While the film certainly has some excellent moments , there are better films by Fields you can watch ( such as IT'S A GIFT , THE BANK DICK , etc . ) . As for West , this is probably a better than average effort from her as at least her character is slightly different than her usual 1930s fare .
Great stuff , . . . for 1898	Okay , if this film had been made much later in the history of cinema , it wouldn't be particularly worthwhile . However , in 1898 , films were in their infancy and they were almost all rather dull and had no real story to tell - - instead just showing normal everyday folks doing everyday activities . If seen today , almost all of them are hopelessly dull and very , very short - - often less than one minute long ! And so in light of this , this short clip of a movie is pretty swell stuff and might just make you laugh . Two guys , a miller and a chimney sweep bump into each other - - falling and throwing flour and coal dust all over each other as they tussle . THAT'S ALL - - the film is over before you know it .
This left me very , very confused ! ! ! !	About a week ago , I watched and loved a British short entitled DADDY'S LITTLE HELPER . I liked it so much , I couldn't wait to review it on IMDb . However , only a week later I stumbled upon FAIT D'HIVER and found that DADDY'S LITTLE HELPER was an almost exact copy - - with only a few differences . Since then , DADDY'S LITTLE HELPER's director / co-writer , Daniel Wilson contacted me to swear the similarities were unintentional - - which can happen and occasionally does . Ain't life odd ? ! As for the film , it is super funny though there is some nudity ( whereas in the British film there's none ) . I could try to explain what happened when the daddy calls his little girl , but it might ruin the suspense . Just see this cute and disturbing little short yourself - - you'll be glad you did .
A must-see for cinephiles	The casual viewer may have little interest in this documentary , but for true lovers of cinema , this is a must-see . Back in the 1970s , when cable was in its infancy and home videotape was unknown , movie lover Jerry Harvey contacted his local cable company to complain about the horrible programming . In an odd twist , they hired him to be a programmer ! Soon after this , the new Z Channel hired him to be their head programmer . Harvey went from being a complete unknown to becoming a cult-like hero to a small group of California subscribers ( where the channel was shown ) . This is because he was very brave in his choices - - often showing art films , unknown films , extended director's cuts ( a first ) and unappreciated films . It seems that his biggest fans were the film makers themselves , as he helped to give exposure to many films that would have otherwise gone into oblivion . Seeing and hearing all the accolades for this cable pioneer was really interesting , but as I said this probably would hold little interest to the casual film viewer who could care less about Truffaut , Berman or Antonioni ( among others ) . However , what becomes fascinating for ANY viewer is the man himself . Harvey was a very disturbed man who had a lifetime of demons and personal baggage - - so much that he ultimately killed his wife and then himself . The film's examination of why this occurred is interesting , but also very unsatisfying because so little is known about his childhood . His two sisters killed themselves ( though there is a tiny doubt about what happened to one of them ) , his father is dead and his mother is very emotionally constricted . So the film chooses to spend much of its focus on the impact of this murder-suicide on those who knew him . What I appreciated was that although many voiced their sadness at his passing and talked about what a great person he was , some others ( particularly in the very end of the film ) were understandably angry about what he did and find it wrong to elevate this guy to sainthood - - after all , he did murder his wife . As a psychology teacher and ex-psychotherapist , this reaction is by far the most fascinating part of the film . By the way , although this is a wonderful film , the film maker Ms . Cassavetes chose a lot of clips for the documentary that are NOT family-appropriate . While there's quite a bit of nudity , most of it isn't salacious and is from art films . However , some of the scenes are borderline pornographic and the scene of Rutger Hauer masturbating makes this a film you DON'T show your kids . Too bad the film included one or two of these clips - - it might alienate some in the audience and wasn't needed to tell the story .
A comedy ? No . But very well constructed .	This is an oddly made but well constructed tale that really demands you pay close attention . Well , when it first began , I was distracted and found it necessary to re-start the film , as the way it's made , it's very easy to lose track of what's happening if you don't give it your full attention . But , considering how well it's done - - it's well worth it . The film starts with a guy calling a radio psychologist to talk about his failing marriage . But , when a co-worker catches him , he pretends he's NOT on the radio and quickly hangs up . This and the way you later see his wife treat him , you really , really feel sorry for the guy . Sure , later he acts a bit goofy , but I really loved how this film tackled a subject that is rarely covered in films - - a woman who cheats on her husband , takes the kid and doesn't feel a whole lot of remorse for the guy . There obviously is more to it than this , but I liked not having the guy be the bad guy for a change of pace - - as life isn't as black and white as our stories often make it . What makes this really interesting , though , isn't just this male aspect of the film but the super-creative transitions that occur in the film - - how one scene cleverly dissolves into another . It sure took a lot of work to do this - - especially so smoothly . Great job and I look forward to seeing more from these folks . The only thing is that I felt this was definitely NOT a comedy no matter what it says on the IMDb page . UPDATI just got word from the film maker who indicated this was made in 8 days and for only $800 dollars ! Wow , I'm even more impressed now that I know that !
For what it was , it was exceptionally well-made	I read some reviews on IMDb that I felt were a bit too harsh for this film , calling it " propaganda " or complaining about how the Germans were all portrayed as evil . And my answer to that is of course it's propaganda and one-sided - - plus , they were Nazis ( and that IS bad if you paid any attention in your history classes ) . You need to understand the context - - - it was made during the war and was intended not as a perfect representation of the Nazis and the Free French movement but as way to bolster support for the war effort at home . In that respect , the film was a tremendous success and stands as one of the better wartime propaganda films made by the Americans . I respect the film for its ability to touch the viewer - - ever today when it's easy to laugh at the jingoistic style of the film since the Nazis seem like a distant memory . The film begins with the war in France in 1940 . When a group of soldiers surrendered after the traitorous French government made peace with the Nazis , instead of being returned home they were sent to a German prison camp and starved and beaten in attempt to break their spirits . The Nazis were all the usual stereotypical bad guys you'd expect , though it was interesting to see the German actor Peter Lorre actually playing a Nazi . Despite his background , during the war he often played French or other non-German characters - - this is a rare chance to see him play a German in an American film . To me , the most interesting characters weren't the Germans or even most of the French prisoners , but the collaborators who actually worked for the Nazis and thrived . Hume Cronyn played a juicy role as a Frenchman only too happy to side with his captors and betray his people . His character was very chilling , but true to this style of film , he got his ultimate reward for his treachery ( sort of like way Peter Graves in STALAG 17 ) . Jean-Pierre Aumont , another collaborator , is another story . While he reluctantly worked with the Germans to save his skin , he could not live with himself unless he continued to resist and fight them covertly - - setting up an exciting escape towards the end of the film . The film ends on a very bloody and exciting note . In fact , now that I think about it , for a Hollywood film of the 1940s , it was an exceptionally bloody and violent film - - though considering the subject matter , this WAS necessary . One particularly brutal scene that actually shocked me and my wife was when Aumont stabbed a German in the throat and it was done realistically and in a close-up shot ! The bottom line is that most people viewing this film probably left the theater angry and wanting to kick Nazi butt - - a good sign that the film achieved its goal . In fact , the film was so patriotic and uplifting that Aumont himself left the safety of the US after finishing this film and he joined the Free French himself and earning a lot of respect for his heroism .
Very funny and very adult	By the way , although the release date is given as 2007 on IMDb , this is definitely an error , as ONE-TRACK MIND was released in a 2006 compilation DVD of short films called " The Short Stack : Volume 1 " . In general , this DVD is rather poor , though ONE-TRACK MIND and THE PAUL DECCA STORY make it worth watching . ONE-TRACK MIND is a film that would probably appeal more to married guys with kids , as you can really relate to this poor schmoe ! It seems that since he and his wife have had kids , their sex life has taken a turn for the worse ( his wife is too tired and the kids keep interrupting ) . To make things worse , since his vasectomy , the poor guy never seems to be able to get even the slightest amount of nookie AND the doctor has told him he must still use a condom because his sperm are still in his system . So , when one night his wife is actually in the mood AND the kids have left them alone , wouldn't you know it but they run out of condoms ! So , much of the movie is spent running around a store at 2am to buy the condoms and get home before she's asleep , not in the mood or the kids have invaded their " love den " ! It's all rather cute and is well worth watching . However , given the subject matter , only an idiot would have their kids watch this one . Do yourself a favor - - watch it with your partner and have a good laugh .
One of the best early Laurel and Hardy films	Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were not deliberately planned to be a comedy team . They did several films together over the years starting with LUCKY DOG and Hal Roach Studios didn't realize they'd be a good team until they just happen to make about a dozen films together . The fact that they appeared together pre-official teaming wasn't surprising , as studios like Roach tended to use the same groups of actors again and again . It was only by chance that they slowly evolved into a team . SAILORS BEWARE is one of these earlier films where Stan and Ollie are not yet a bone fide team . Like so many of these movies , their parts are very separate and they play against each other more than with each other . Because of this their chemistry is all wrong compared to what we are used to and most of these earlier films are sub-par for the boys . However , in the case of SAILORS BEWARE , the film is still excellent - - one of the best before they became an official team . In fact , it is better than quite a few of their later films as well due to an excellent and exciting script . The film begins with cabbie Laurel getting stuck on a cruise ship after bringing aboard a rich lady and her baby . Because Laurel isn't able to afford the fare , he is made to work on board - - with Ollie as his not particularly nice boss . At about the same time , there are a number of thefts on the ship and it's up to Stan to get to the bottom of it . Seeing that the baby is played by Harry Earles - - a somewhat famous dwarf who acted in several films - - it isn't too surprising to guess who's behind the thefts . Interestingly , Earles plays much the same character he played in both the silent and sound versions of THE UNHOLY THREE ( with Lon Chaney ) . Still , despite me recognizing him , it still was an exciting and funny film - - one worth seeing by anyone - - not just Laurel and Hardy fans .
very good story , not quite as many laughs	This is a very good Buster Keaton film . However , some might be put off by the scarcity of pratfalls and belly laughs compared to many of his other efforts . That's because this film is much more plot driven and character driven than most silent comedies - - and that works well for me , though you might miss the more acrobatic and violent character he plays in his shorts and in some of his full-length ones . Buster plays a spoiled rich young man who really needs to be toughened up - - so his dad tells him to go camping . The next segment is probably the funniest , as it cuts to a " wilderness " scene - - complete with a butler , tub , poster bed , and all the other modern conveniences ( that's the way I'd like to camp ! ) . While " camping " he meets a nice girl and he is smitten . Instead of Buster going to propose , he sends his butler - - who immediately knows her dad will say " no " because he wants a virile , more " studly " son-in-law . So , the butler panics and says that Buster is the famous boxer Alfred " Battling " Butler ! Now , the two men do have the same name and are roughly the same size - - but that's about the only similarity . Daddy gives his hearty approval and Buster is married . But , when the real Butler wins the title , Buster has a hard time pretending any longer . Later , the real Butler retires and Buster takes his place - - going to training camp and working for a title defense ! You'll have to tune in to see what happens next , as this only takes you through about half the film - - watch it and enjoy .
Great escapist fantasy that both men and women will enjoy	This is a marvelous but pretty much undiscovered film from the 1980s that somehow " slipped under the radar " - - getting little attention at its release . And this is a great shame , as it's a charming and funny film about a romance writer that will appeal to both men and women . JoBeth Williams plays a frustrated woman who reads a lot of romance novels - - particularly those involving a character named " Rebecca Ryan " . She wins a trip to go to France , but her selfish husband doesn't want to go even though it's free ( what a jerk ) , so she goes without him . However , once there , she is hit on the head ( a familiar plot device , I know ) and she believes she IS Rebecca Ryan ! ! This Rebecca Ryan is sort of like James Bond and Jessica Fletcher combined and she insists she is on the trail of a crime . However , she soon meets the actual person who writes the Rebecca Ryan stories and HE recognizes everything she is saying as coming from the books HE wrote ( yep - - the author is a guy writing under a pen name and uses his mother to pose as her ) . He ( played by Tom Conti ) realizes she's a very disturbed woman , but JoBeth Williams is SO convincing as Ms . Ryan that people don't believe him and think she really is an international woman of mystery and battler of evil ! ! ! Where the script goes from here is amazing and silly - - especially because JoBeth actually finds herself tied up in a REAL international assassination plot ! It is a highly amusing film that is both a " chick flick " and a lot of fun for guys in the audience as well .
a Bergman film that's not depressing or about death !	I've seen a lot of Ingmar Bergman films and sometimes I don't want to see one of his films about death or mental illness . Well , starting in the 1960s to the 1980s , these were the main themes of his movies , but in some of his earlier films , these are not so pervasive - - such as the movies The Devil's Eye ( a comedy ) and The Magician ( " Ansiktet " ) . Because of this , they may be more approachable to the average viewer who would balk at the much more serious tone of such classics as Through a Glass Darkly ( deep depression ) , Persona ( mental illness ) , Autumn Sonata ( repressed anger and abandonment ) , The Seventh Seal ( death and the plague ) or Fanny and Alexander ( child abuse and emotional neglect ) . The story is about a traveling group of hoaxters who put on a show combining magic and " animal magnetism " ( i . e . , an early name given to hypnosis ) . When they arrive at a Swedish town , they are forced to come to an audience with the local official and his cronies who want to prove that the act is a fraud . Bergman really doesn't try to resolve this issue , but instead shows how the town officials are really rather petty and mean people . How this traveling group deftly survives this encounter is the main focus of the movie . I especially liked the portion of the movie about the autopsy . It sounds gross , but I thought it was actually kind of funny . One of the officials is a cold and rather nasty doctor who longs for a chance to do an autopsy on the hypnotist . He gets far more than he bargains for - - that's all I really want to say - - otherwise it might ruin the suspense . So , overall I liked the movie . It was not great but well acted and not the least bit depressing .
I wanted to hate this movie but couldn't - - it was a wonderful surprise	In the last year or so , I think I've started to lose my mind . You see , up until then I avoided Adam Sandler movies - - mostly because I so disliked him on " Saturday Night Live " . However , in the last year or so , I have seen several of his older films that I actually liked . Now , this does NOT mean that I particularly liked all of his film ! After all , BILLY MADISON and HAPPY GILMORE are hard to love - - though I will admit that parts of them were pretty good . LITTLE NICKY , on the other hand , was just sludge ! But CLICK , WATERBOY and now THE WEDDING SINGER are all movies that I grudgingly must admit were far better than I'd expected - - especially THE WEDDING SINGER . I think the biggest reason I liked THE WEDDING SINGER was that it wasn't really a comedy but more of a romance - - something that seemed to fit Sandler much better and I wish he'd consider making more of these . That's because although the film certainly stuck to established formula , the characters were all so very likable and sweet . As a result , you really cared about them and you got sucked into the story . One of the great moments was when the lady sang to her husband on their 50th anniversary and another was when Sandler had a heart-to-heart talk with his best friend in the bar . Of course you KNEW what had to happen by the end , but still you couldn't help but need a couple hankies - - the writing , construction and acting were that good . On top of the characters , this is a great nostalgia piece that would appeal to people of my generation . Despite one reviewer saying that there was nothing positive about the 80s , this is when I met and married my wife . Hearing all the great songs and seeing the romance reminded me what a lucky guy I am . If you are looking for laugh out loud comedy , this probably isn't for you . Sure , there are a few funny moments ( I REAAAALLY loved the song he composed both before and after he was dumped , for example ) , but the film is much more of a sweet romance . See this one with somebody you love - - there are so many wonderful moments in it you can't help but enjoy yourself . An immensely enjoyable film .
Full of twists - - it will keep you guessing	This is a very interesting short film because it caught me off guard several times - - something that happens very seldom to us with most films . The ability to confuse or misdirect the viewer is the sign of a very good movie in most cases . Here , combined with excellent acting and direction , it all works together very well indeed . The film starts with a woman sneaking into a home and cooking a fancy dinner . However , after a bit you come to think that maybe there's much more to the story than this , as there's a guy hiding in the basement and the cook seems a bit . . . confused . However , the more you watch , the more it all seems to come together . By the way , it was Edith Piaf singing at the end and , appropriately , she sings in French about how she regrets nothing . . . A very appropriate and twisted choice for music .
A very good reworking of an early Griffith short	This story is a slight reworking of an early D . W . Griffith short , THE UNCHANGING SEA . While both films are short , this remake is significantly longer and allows for a much fuller and more interesting tale . It's interesting that the movie is broken into two sections here on IMDb , as I saw them both together as one 33-minute film . A man goes to sea and is shipwrecked - - leaving his wife to raise their two small kids . Many years pass and she holds out hope that he'll return . Again and again through the years , a friend offers to marry her . Only after her kids have grown does she agree . A short time later , the husband is rescued and returns ! How exactly this is handled , you'll have to see for yourself . Part I concerns the marriage , his going to sea and the shipwreck . Part II concerns life after this up until his return .
Exceptional BUT very sad indeed .	This is a fascinating film , as the Vaudeville comedian Bert Williams posed as a white man in black face for the film . Little did the audience know that he REALLY was a Black American and painted around his mouth to make him appear to be a minstrel ! Oddly enough , the other Black men in the movie actually appear to be Black - - not painted up to look that way . In addition , the inter-title cards are written in very stereotypical and offensive " black-speak " - - making Williams and his friends sound like idiots ( such as " Poka - - de rulin ' pashon " . This is a sad commentary about society and the biography of this mostly forgotten performer listed on IMDb is rather fascinating . It's all a shame really , as Mr . Williams was pretty funny in the film - - particularly during his solo routine at the end of the film - - earning it an 8 ( as it is funnier than most of its contemporary comedies ) . In addition , for historical reasons , this IS an important film and gives us a fascinating glimpse into our forgotten past .
Not a lot of depth , but it's well done	So far , this film only has a few votes on IMDb but all are either 9 or 10 . While I also liked it , I wasn't quite that impressed because the story wasn't particularly deep - - though I am quick to admit that the stop-motion animation is exceptional . The story begins with a cow in its pasture admiring the flowers . However , a pesky sheep keeps eating the flowers and the cow becomes angry . Soon , it's like a WWE wrestling match and the cow and sheep knock each other senseless . The problem is that that's really about all there is to it - - two nicely rendered stop-motion animals fighting . It is funny but somewhat lacks depth . Still for a project by relative newcomers , it's pretty good and shows a lot of promise .
Excellent film and George Lucas ' inspiration	This is a very good and enjoyable adventure comedy that reportedly was much of the inspiration for George Lucas ' film , STAR WARS . However , unlike STAR WARS , this film is set on Earth - - in Japan to be exact . The film begins with learning that a battle has taken place and two men who ran from the action are just trying to save their own skin . Along the way , they meet up with a very dedicated samurai ( Toshiro Mifune ) that enlists them against their will to help him in his task to protect his lady . The two " heroes " are hardly excited about the prospect but are taken against their wills into Mufune's confidence because apparently there really is no one else left to help ! These two guys appear to be the inspiration for R2D2 and C3PO , believe it or not , and Mifune is sort of like a lone " Jedi " trying to save the lady who turns out to be a princess - - - sure sounds familiar does't it ? ! This film is wonderful and entertaining and a must to all the STAR WARS geeks out there . After all , if they go to all the trouble of dressing up , buying lots of expensive paraphernalia AND standing in line for days to see these sci-fi films , then watching this film should be a snap ! !
exceptional but very dark	For those who have already seen IN THE GOOD OLD SUMMER TIME , this movie will come as quite a shock . That's because IN THE GOOD OLD SUMMER TIME is a remake of THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER but it's a much lighter and happier film - - plus it's a musical . While the stories are very similar , THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER deals with such topics as attempted suicide and infidelity ! ! How this is NOT to say that it's a bad movie - - just VERY different in tone . Many may find the original film better , but I guess I am just an old softy and like the bouncier remake . Both are excellent and you should see them both . Now , concerning the recent remake with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan ( YOU'VE GOT MAIL ) , I do not recommend it . While similar in plot , it just does nothing to add to the story and was a totally forgettable film . I really wanted to like it more than I did .
Rather chilling . . .	This is a particularly scary film because the terror in this film isn't some ridiculous guy in a hockey mask or zombies but something seemingly much more possible . The film begins with a couple hearing that terrorists have detonated a chemical weapon and so they dutifully tape up all their windows and hunker down until they get the all clear signal . However , it just doesn't seem to come and the film shows the progression of the couple's humanity as the emergency continues . At first , they are cautiously optimistic and by day 14 , they are ready to kill each other ! At day 17 , the wife figures a way out of this mess . The film does a good job of tapping into the darkness of human nature . While there is swearing and violence , it is really necessary as the couple become more and more savage and fearful of death . Excellent , though I did think that perhaps day 17 did seem a bit quick for the denouement .
If you like strange , then this short documentary is for you ! !	This documentary appears to be the rather random ramblings of a man who wonders if the aliens who crashed in Roswell were perhaps amnesia victims . The film maker travels to Roswell and videos this trip . I liked this weird documentary very much , though I am sure that most viewers will either love it or hate it because it is so very different . Bill Brown apparently has made several quirky little documentaries that have a real home-made look to them and seem like the amateur ramblings of a person who is missing a few brain cells ! Despite the look and the oddly philosophical dialog that make him sound like a crank , Brown is actually Harvard educated and seems to have deliberately chosen this style - - a style which is funny but in a very dry and somber manner that may catch many off guard . I liked it , but again I think some will just find the whole thing very confusing .
Very good and very polished . . . but an Oscar for Best Actor for Stewart ? !	The studio pulled out the stops for this film , casting Katherine Hepburn , Cary Grand AND Jimmy Stewart in the leading roles . While Hepburn's star had tarnished a bit in recent years , Stewart just came off his classic performance in MR . SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON ( for which some were disappointed that he didn't get the Oscar ) and Grant had just come off a long string of successes . In addition , the MGM production just looked beautiful - - with grand sets and excellent work all around . As a result , it's not very surprising that's it's a very entertaining film , though for me , I never LOVED this film as many have . Plus , I always felt bad for gold old Cary Grant . As usual , he didn't win an Oscar for his performance ( he never won a regular Oscar - - just an honorary one years later despite MANY great performances - - particularly in light comedies ) BUT , oddly , Stewart did get the Oscar for Best Actor - - even though his role was clearly a supporting one ! I guess they were trying to make up for his loss the year before , though this is NOT one of Stewart's best performances . Still , the movie is fun and light and enjoyable - - thanks mostly , in my opinion , to Grant - - with help from Hepburn and Stewart !
The story of a man's love for a sheep . . .	Despite my very accurate summary , this film about a man's love for his sheep is NOT a sick and depraved film but a documentary about a hermit , of sorts , and the lost sheep he adopts . Long ago , Peter moved to the middle of nowhere and after decades of isolation he happened upon a lost sheep and he raised it . However , after some time , the sheep seems much more like a dog or family pet and Peter realized it would be best to return Ben the sheep to a flock . So with obvious emotion reminiscent of the film BORN FREE , Ben is reunited with his fellow sheep . Despite a very odd topic for a film , this short documentary manages to deliver thanks to good camera-work , music and the ability to make this story seem interesting . A nice job all around . . . and NOT to be confused for a film about a man who is strangely attracted to a sheep !
Exceptional but perhaps a tad overrated	While I have always thought this movie was a bit overrated , it is still an exceptional film and those on IMDb who gave it scores of 1 or 2 are way out of line . Overrated it might be , but it STILL is a very good and interesting film . First , I'll complain about a few things - - then discuss all the good about the film . The original story by Daphne du Maurier was a lot more risquÃ© than the film - - with a bisexual story line that is only barely hinted at in the movie . You really can't blame the film makers for this , as the Hollywood Production Code wouldn't allow this plot line to be pursued . So , instead , Rebecca was promiscuous but only with men . In addition , I am really amazed that Joan Fontaine received the Best Actress Oscar for this film . Her character often stared into space and appeared more slow-witted or annoying than just a " fish out of water " . My daughter watched the film with me and said " why is that lady acting so twitchy ? " . In other words , she behaved in a rather strange and inexplicable manner during some of the film - - particularly when she was at Mandalay . Also , I really couldn't understand why the DeWinters kept their crazy old housekeeper - - after all , she tried to drive the mistress of the house to suicide . Isn't this grounds for termination of her services ? ! ! Now , despite these complaints that definitely mar the film , there was so much to like about the movie . The script was daring and creative despite the limitations . Most times I see a movie , I say to myself that it reminds me of some other films I've seen , but in this case REBECCA is truly unique and creative . The film also had many , many twists and turns and provided one of the best endings I have seen in some time . In addition , I also liked the camera-work and music , as they created a wonderful ambiance . Despite being a black and white film , it was a beautiful picture . So my advice is to definitely see the film but just be prepared to ignore the plot holes . A hole-ridden film , to me , is still worth seeing in some cases , but somehow doesn't seem worthy of being in IMDb's top 250 .
Though I really don't care about the music , the quality of this film is obvious	This film was recently posted on IMDb for viewing . This is a documentary about a subject I know nothing about nor do I really care for - - yet I was STILL very impressed because of the quality of the production . As the film showed a wide variety of fans of the band House of Freaks , the visuals were amazing . Many of the scenes were shown using incredibly artistic shots . The use of rear-projected scenes , video shot on many different textures , etc . all gave this film a really beautiful look - - even though the documentary was about the tragic slaughter of the band's front man and his family . Artistically , this film is as good as you could possibly get and so it's no wonder that it's an award-winning film . Other documentary makers need to see this film in order to become inspired to do more than just point a camera at people and ask them to talk ! Exceptional .
Weird but very , very captivating	This is a very strange short film that is also very captivating . Oddly , however , when this film was shown on cable TV , it was called " Uncle " but this is NOT the correct title , but " Brother " . Uncle was another video by the same director - - part of a trilogy made up of UNCLE , COUSIN and BROTHER . The film is a strange journey through claymation into the world of the narrator as he talks about his childhood . All the family is introduced , but the bulk of this film focuses on the narrator's odd brother . This brother had a lazy eye , was an asthmatic and was a very strange kid - - most of which made me laugh - - especially when the claymation animation was so cute and enlivened the narration . However , at the end , a poignant moment occurs - - making this a very sad tale indeed . While there have been many claymation films before AND many which had better animation , rarely was I as touched or laughed as much as I did here . I particularly liked the rather dead-pan narration and the incredible weirdness of the animation . A sweet little film - - it got me looking for COUSIN and UNCLE so I could complete the trilogy .
one of Bete Davis ' best	Here we have Bette Davis as we all know and love her - - as the evil , conniving , self-centered tart she played so well throughout her career ! Although she was wonderful playing nice people in Now , Voyager and All This And Heaven Too , the bitchy character is the one we mostly attribute to Ms . Davis . In this movie , Bette does everything she can to ruin her sister's life - - not because there is any malice , but just because she doesn't care . First , she steals her kind sister's fiancÃ© but then she shows hardly any remorse or decency for the rest of the picture . Olivia de Havilland plays the all-too-patient sister , and you'll probably find yourself rooting for her to punch Davis in the mouth ( or worse ) . This is a 1940s Warner Brothers soap opera at its best . On top of this , is has one of the better endings you'll see - - giving both Davis and Coburn's characters a wonderful " comeuppance " . By the way , for those interested in psychology , Ms . Davis ' character is a wonderful example of a Borderline Personality . Similar to this diagnosis , her character displays no empathy or regard for others , an amazing ability to lie , a total inability to cope with boredom , a need to screw up her life , drinking to excess , extreme dependence on her enabling family members , histrionic behavior and shallowness and explosiveness in relationships with the opposite sex . Her " beloved " uncle , played by Charles Coburn is a great example of an Antisocial Personality who has learned to channel his evil into legal but highly unethical behavior . By the way , if you watched the film , too , didn't you think there were indications that the relationship between Coburn and Davis was incestuous or nearly so ? ! Pretty creepy if you ask me !
Like a child's dream come to life . . .	What an incredibly cool story ! ! Without any words and a simple plot , the film makers were able to make an incredibly compelling and exciting animated story . The film begins like either a dream or a world where you have Flubber in your shoes . As the unseen protagonist is bouncing down the road , a car quickly approaches and he / she jumps over it ! Then , throughout the film , the person jumps higher and higher and higher . Because they include lots of cute little scenes , believe it or not , this does not become repetitive ! For example , if you watch closely you can see C-3PO and R2-D2 in a very brief scene , a naked lady sunbathing , a man being captured by cannibals , a war and even a quick jump down into Hell ! ! It's so surreal and strange but you just can't stop watching . And , to make it even better , the animation quality is very good and the film bears up to repeated viewing . A wonderful and one of a kind short film . PS - - Keep watching the final credits and you'll see them jumping as well !
a very disarming little comedy	This is one of the strangest movies of the 1950s - - starting BEFORE the opening credits and lasting until the final seconds ! Just plain weird ! It seems the insignificantly small Duchey of Grand Fenwick is in crisis - - the nation is nearly bankrupt and there appears to be no way out of their financial dilemma . Untimately they hit upon a plan - - they will declare war against the United States and quickly surrender . Then , based on how the US treated its defeated foes after WW2 , the US is sure to pour mountains of financial aid into Grand Fenwick ! The first problem is they don't have an army . What they do have are some old medieval suits of armor and some bows and arrows , so with these they set off for America ! What happens next , you'll just have to see to believe ! This movie is very interesting because Peter Sellars appears in the movie in many different roles ( apparently the gene pool in Grand Fenwick is rather limited ) - - ranging from the hero of the story , Tully Bascombe to the conniving prime minister to even the queen ! It reminds me very much of the Alec Guinness film KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS , in which Guinness played multiple roles . The down side is that occasionally the plot lags and becomes a bit too silly . However , considering the risks they take and the overall weirdness and how funny the movie is in general , I think these lags can easily be over looked . This movie had a sequel , MOUSE ON THE MOON , about the space race . I didn't particularly care for that - - it was very silly but the magic just wasn't there .
a great accompaniment to the DVD set	The DVD set Warner Brothers released for THE GOLD RUSH was fantastic - - giving both the original release , the re-release ( including narration by Chaplin ) and this documentary about the making of the film . It gives a lot of amazing inside information and greatly enhances the film - - unlike the " extras " in most DVDs ( that often seemed more like a tacked-on element at best ) . In particular , I liked how it discussed the creation of the huge sets as well as the extreme difficulties they faced filming the on-site shots in the Sierra Nevadas . This movie is a must for film buffs and lovers of the work of Chaplin . Watch the movie then be sure to watch this featurette - - it helps bring the movie alive .
An amazing and interesting piece of history	This was a public service film designed to encourage Americans to save scrap for the war effort . While the cartoon was made by Looney Toons and featured Daffy Duck , since it wasn't an official release and wasn't intended as a money-maker , it was made in black and white ( a common practice at the time ) . Despite it not being in color , the cartoon is high quality - - with excellent writing and animation . Daffy's scrap drive is making Hitler nervous , so he sends orders that this pile must be destroyed . It all looks bad for poor Daffy when he's attacked - - at which time he makes a very funny remark about how he wished he had a can of spinach ( a reference to Popeye ) . But , in the end , Super-Daffy comes to the rescue and the world is made safe from Nazi tyranny ! Huzzah ! As a cartoon , it's pretty good . But as a public service announcement intended to encourage Americans to help with the war effort it is stellar , as it's very effective yet not preachy or dull .
an excellent and under-appreciate was film	This film goes beyond the standard WW2 war film due to excellent writing and acting . Of course , due to the propaganda needs of the time ( it was filmed during the war ) , it included an incredibly diverse and multinational cast of heroes in order to bolster the war effort at home . It seem unlikely that such a diverse group of soldiers would have actually fallen together like they did in the movie , but that can easily be forgiven . Plus , the characterizations of the gungho evil Nazi prisoner and the war weary and decent Italian soldier are designed for to further the war effort at home . But , because it's so well done , you'll excuse these overly stereotypical roles . Especially since everything else works together so well . The plot is simple - - following a battle , diverse allied troops happen together to form a small company in search of the rest of their armies AND to find water ( since after all , it is in the North African desert ) . Along the way , they stumble upon the German uber-Nazi and Italian soldiers who they take prisoner . Eventually , they find some water at an ancient deserted fortress and then they wait , . . . . . What happens next , you'll have to see for yourself . The plot has some really nice twists and you'll really grow to care about these men and their plight . This is a Bogart film but he is so ably assisted it's hard to just characterize it has HIS film .
an overlooked gem !	I was amazed when I saw this picture . After having seen The Horn Blows at Midnight , I had assumed that all of Jack Benny's pictures were pretty stupid and that his talent only extended to television and radio . Boy was I wrong . This very short movie ( 57 minutes ) is outstanding and I have nothing negative to say about it . Benny is actually NOT the Meanest Man in the world but perhaps one of the nicest in the film . This is a real surprise because he is a lawyer ( sorry to all you lawyers reading this ) . However , he finds that if people THINK he is mean and heartless his business will pick up considerably ! If it comes on TCM or you can find it on video , give it a try . You're bound to love it ( unless YOU are the meanest man in the world ) .
Not especially close to the original novel , but what a visual delight !	When I mentioned that the movie isn't especially close to the novel by Goethe , this ISN'T that bad a problem . Unfortunately for me , as a college student decades ago I was forced to read this epic story and it was tedious to say the least . It was 25 , 000 of non-rhyming verse that went on and on and on and on , . . . . seemingly with no end ! Fortunately , this movie is relatively fast paced and interesting - - probably because it DOESN'T follow the original ! ! Now the plot is possibly familiar to you . Faust is offered a deal by the devil - - he can have youth and beauty and live out his every wish provided he give up his soul . The prologue to this involving the archangel debating with Satan is GREAT - - the make up and costumes are amazing ! Faust agrees and lives like a jerk - - eventually getting a sweet young lady , Gretchen , pregnant and leaving her . However , like the novel , in the end Faust has second thoughts about what he's become . The star of this movie are the special effects and costuming as well as the gorgeous cinematography . For all fans of the silents , this is a must-see .
It's hard to watch without becoming affected	This is a two Kleenex short film - - the sort that might make many out there cry . That's because the topic is child abuse and the film is about a boy in a coma who is on death's door after being beaten . While you see the boy lying in bed covered in bandages , you see the boy walking about the hospital with a little girl who seems to be acting as his guide . The boy can't recall exactly what has happened or why he is there and the little girl does her best to comfort him and reassure him that everything is now going to be fine . While much of the film is pretty obvious ( you'll probably quickly realize the boy in the coma is the boy wandering unseen about the hospital ) but despite this , it's an excellent film for many reasons . The use of Barber's Adagio is very effective , as this is probably one of the saddest musical pieces ever written , yet it is also soft and complements the film well . Likewise , the soft lighting and cinematography is exceptional . These combine to set an appropriately somber mood and do a lot to manipulate the viewer into an emotional reaction ( something tough to do but done well here ) . As a result , it makes a strong emotional connection with the viewer about child abuse and you can't help but be pulled into this finely crafted film .
Perfect ? Of course not , but it's the closest I've seen to Ian Fleming's novels	For many years , I have longed to see a James Bond series actually based on the books . While some of the Bond films have been a lot of fun , most have practically nothing to do with the great Ian Fleming novels . Sadly , in a few cases ( such as YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE ) , about the only similarity between the books and the movies were the titles ! In fact , the original CASINO ROYALE was a horrid film in practically every way except for the music . While some of the characters were retained , the movie was an abysmal mess - - a very high budget and confusing mess . It was purported to be a comedy , though practically none of the film was funny and like YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE , the plot was impossible to follow and bore no similarity to the book . Fans of Ian Fleming usually twitch with disgust at even hearing the title of this god-awful film - - thank goodness someone FINALLY wanted to do the Fleming novel some justice ! In the books , Bond was a bourbon drinking , chain-smoking assassin . CASINO ROYALE was the first book and Bond was his most human in it . In the book , Bond struggled with guilt over the many people he'd killed - - and they were NOT killed in crazy and exotic ways like they were in most of the movies . Most were either shot or killed with his bare hands . Bond was , above all else , a killer - - not quite as sexy or sophisticated as he was in the films . While Craig isn't quite the same as Fleming's Bond ( he's missing the scar down his cheek ) , he's much closer to the novels than any prior Bond incarnation . I miss that Bond and am glad that , in part , the new CASINO ROYALE finally features much of this cold-blooded and flawed character . Now I do understand that EON Productions couldn't repeat the novel completely - - heck , it was set in the early 1950s and many allowances needed to be made for current events . And as far as the updates went , they generally were in the same spirit as the original movie and the cat and mouse game between Le Chiffre and Bond is essentially that of the novel . All this does NOT mean that the movie will only appeal to those who read the books . There are still many exciting chase scenes and stunts like you'd expect to see in a Bond film but fortunately Bond didn't seem so invincible . Daniel Craig's version of Bond could apparently do what the prior Bonds could do , but you'll notice throughout the film that he's cut and bruised - - not exactly a man of steel . I loved this and it did tend to make the unrealness of the stunts seem a tad more believable . Plus , again , Fleming would be thrilled as several stories he wrote talked about the toll on Bond's body . The film was well-constructed , stunt heavy but not enough to alienate purists like myself and intelligently written . About the only people who will strongly dislike this film are those who are looking for a reincarnation of Sean Connery or Roger Moore . Craig certainly doesn't look or act like either of these two guys . While I could easily imagine Connery's or Moore's characters sipping martinis while engaged in gay banter with their arch-enemies , Craig is more the type you'd expect to beat the enemies to death with his bare hands - - like a REAL government assassin . Wow , do I like the change ! PS - - The Aston Martin DBS V12 in this movie is a gorgeous car and it should be with a base price of $265 , 000 . In the film , it is destroyed and I truly hope this was a model or something other than one of these great sports cars - - it would be tragic if they really did in this car !
There's an 80 minute AND a shorter version - - I saw the shorter one .	I thought that IMDb was wrong about the length of this film , as I clearly saw an 18 minute film by this exact director and with the exact same title . After first posting this review , I got an email from Sean Farley indicating there ARE two different versions - - the longer and the shorter one . My review is for the short one , but considering how much I liked it , I really want to find the full version . SURVIVING THE RUSH is certainly not a very polished film . It looks like a well-made amateur film - - with a relatively low budget , no-name actors and simple sets . However , despite this , it's also a tremendously entertaining short film - - one that you can enjoy and ignore its artistic deficiencies as well as the occasionally crude language . This is because the writing and energy level are so high that you can't help but like the film and keep watching . The bottom line is that it is very , very funny and there's a lot of charm to SURVIVING THE RUSH . The film is about a movie theater where everything seems to go wrong during one particular evening - - and I do mean EVERYTHING ! ! Rats in the popcorn , a broken film and insanely annoying customers and the manager of this theater is really at wits end by the end of the shift ! You really have to feel sorry for the guy - - though watching him and his staff being tortured is awfully funny in an Itchy and Scratchy sort of way ! ! This film is one of the bonus shorts included with the wonderful DVD " A Collection of 2006 Academy Award Nominated Short Films " - - a must have for fans of the genre . Buy this DVit's one of the best I've ever invested in and I'll be watching it again .
awful and relentless as well as great	This is certainly NOT a feel-good film , as it deals with the horrors of the Nazis and their crushing of the Warsaw uprising of 1944 . After all , there is no way or reason to make this a nice or fun movie to view . It just isn't possible . BUT , we are treated to an intensely realistic and viscerally disturbing film showing the war in all its awfulness . The first portion of the film is set in crumbling buildings and the nobility of the cause is apparent . However , the vast majority of the film is set in the sewers ( hence the title " Kanal " ) and the characters , over time , lose some of their nobility and just ache to survive . The film is intensely claustrophobic and the filth they move about in literally looks like raw sewage - - so as the characters fight for life and , in most cases , give up hope , you find yourself being pulled into their world and their terror . A great , though intensely awful film to watch . So , it comes as no surprise that I would not recommend this film to children or people afflicted with claustrophobia . PS - - if the musician seems familiar , it's because Wladyslaw Sheybal ( also known as " Vladek Sheybal " ) is one of the Bond Villains in the movie FROM Russia WITH LOVE .
Keep watching this until the end !	This is a cute little Australian short film that you really need to watch all the way through . That's because the first portion is a bit dull and you may not realize that the film REALLY will shoot into high gear towards the end . The film begins with a father and son talking about the family's sports legacy . They discuss how this tradition is being passed down for generations and there seems to be a lot of pressure on the son to continue the tradition . A bit later , you see the son practicing playing cricket and you really feel sorry for him with all the family hopes resting on him . When it comes time for the big game , you are in for a HUGE surprise and the film jumps headlong into comedy gold . I can't say any more - - I don't want to ruin the joke . Exceptionally well made . Nicely constructed and great for a laugh . The only reservation I have is that the material is a bit too racy for younger viewers , so be forewarned .
Timeless and LOTS of fun	Despite this cartoon being about WWII , it is still a great cartoon here in the 21st century . That's because unlike some American propaganda cartoons of the era , this one is so funny and well-made that it still is a super-impressive film . The film begins in a surreal world where Spike Jones ' song , Der Fuehrer's Face , is being blared everywhere by a group of bumbling Nazis . In the middle of this awful world is poor Donald Duck - - who is being forced at gunpoint to heil the Fuehrer and make munitions for the Axis at an alarming rate . The film becomes much sillier and weirder , as Donald goes faster and faster until he becomes mentally unhinged ! This is absolutely hilarious . The cartoon ends with Donald awakening to find it's all a bad dream . he's back in the good old USA and life is good . Inventive , cute and a lot more fun than other Disney shorts , this is the absolute height of Disney's creative talents . Plus , it's a wonderful history lesson ! UPDATWhen I first wrote this review , it was practically impossible to find this cartoon , as " politically correct " types had buried all the cartoons at Disney and Warner Brothers because they might offend - - even films that show evil Nazis ( after all , children can never see ANYONE as evil or see a swastika ) . Fortunately , the short WAS re-released with the recent Volume 2 of the Best of Donald from Disney . This multi-disk set is terrific - - not just for this cartoon , but for all of them . Buy it now , as it's only scheduled to be on sale for a limited time AND volume one is already sold out everywhere . My only reservation is that Disney is so concerned about political correctness that there's a very long prologue by Leonard Maltin that you are forced to first watch - - you cannot skip it . And , if you go back to see other " banned " films , it makes you watch the Maltin segment again ! Annoying , but a small price to pay to see these wonderful films .
The best Pixar film ( so far ) and a good bit better than the original	I liked TOY STORY but didn't love it . It had some wonderful moments ( I liked the creepy and destructive kid next door ) , but it seemed marketed almost exclusively to young boys . In light of this , I was absolutely thrilled when I saw TOY STORY II , as it's a wonderful film for the entire family . For the boys , you have the familiar characters of Woody and Buzz , for the girls you have a new girl toy ( Jessie ) and for the adult , you have some great characters as well ( Stinky Pete and the guy in the chicken costume ) . Plus , the writing is so amazingly clever and engaging you can't help but love the film . I particularly loved the showdown with Emperor Zurg , Barbie's guest appearance and all the cute little touches as well as homages to toys of yesteryear . And , for once in my jaded career as a reviewer , I have absolutely nothing negative or critical to mention - - I enjoyed every minute of this delightful film .
For 1929 , it was great !	This is the very first Silly Symphony short from Disney . While I have never been a huge fan of these films because they are all basically well animated music videos , I sure liked THE SKELETON DANCE . The biggest reason is that for 1929 , it was amazingly good - - with super animation . Plus the whole package was very high on the cool as well as creepy factors . What a great film to show for Halloween . Oddly , the opening credits appear in total silence . However , once the film begins the music starts . This certainly got my attention ! The film consists of four skeletons in a graveyard coming out at night to dance and have a good time . This would have been very repetitive had the film been longer , but at a little over five minutes , it was just perfect .
