Consider this a dry run for parts of King Kong and it becomes worthwhile	This short hasn't aged well-and I don't simply mean film stock aging either . The plot , the script and the idea are now creaky . Given that Willis O'Brien was part of the technical crew on King Kong some 15 years later , the stop-motion work in the last fourth or so of the film is really training for what he did on that film . It has a certain historic significance , but little else . Not even as a charming , if dusty curio . For ardent film buffs only , with the above caveats .
This one will never air , but it isn't all that good in any case .	I suspect that even if there weren't stereotypes and caricatures that would be viewed as unacceptable today , this one probably wouldn't air today because it simply isn't all that funny . It starts off okay , but then we meet the " hero " , who's about as stupid as they come ( I've seen better heads on a glass of root beer ) and it goes downhill from his entrance on . This one just doesn't work for some reason . Of interest only to die-hard Warner Brothers fans and rare cartoon enthusiasts . Otherwise , skip this altogether .
Bosko and Bruno as hobos in an average short where not much happens	This is , at best , an average short in the Bosko series . It isn't awful , but it isn't memorable for much , either , as there isn't a great deal going on here . Here there be mild spoilers : Bosko is seen in the beginning carrying what was called a " bindlestiff " , or a stick with a bundle on the end , tied in a piece of cloth which contains basically all your belongings . Bosko is a hobo , a tramp , " gentleman at liberty " and he's joined by his dog , Bruno . They're walking along a railroad track when a train comes along . That's basically it as far as plot goes-they're either running from an oncoming train or riding on top of a runaway train . There are a few gags in other areas ( Bruno battles a flea near the beginning of the short , for example ) but the short basically has the pair placed in danger in one way or another because of trains or parts of trains . The animation is very nice in spots , but at least two sequences is clearly the same drawings used repeatedly to show the same action more than once . This would probably be a more interesting short if there were a bit more variation to the bits , but there isn't , so it is what it is-a fairly basic and somewhat predictable cartoon . I still would like for it to appear on a future Looney Tunes Golden Collection . Worth seeing at least once .
Not much to this particular short , which is limited , even for a Bosko	Though there are a few nice bits in here , there really isn't much substance to this one overall . It's just an average short , with little to interest or bore the general viewer . If you really like Bosko , you'll enjoy it enormously . There will be spoilers from here on out : This short can basically be summed up as follows : See Bosko . See Bruno . See Bosko skate . See Bruno repeat a gag three times and eventually fall through a hole in the ice . See the foregoing take up almost half the cartoon . See Bruno find a baby . See Bosko and Bruno take the very loud baby home and try to make it happy . See Bruno sit on a stove . See baby laugh uproariously . See Bosko play the piano and sing . See baby dance and Bosko and baby sing in " scat " style . See Bosko have an accident and wind up with a fishbowl as headgear . See very mean baby laugh . Iris out . Not the greatest Bosko or the worst Bosko . This short is just " okay " . I do hope , however , that this ultimately does get released on a Looney Tunes Golden Collection in the future . Worth watching at least once .
The title character is aptly named and , to me , thoroughly unappealing	Not a bad cartoon , but one of two ( starring the same character ) that I don't like much . Good use of limited animation , but Pete Hothead is a most unlikable character , which is the point , I suppose . For UPA completeists , though others might not find the character so irritating . Think Donald Duck without feathers and clearer speech .
The hospital is no place to be sick . !	This short takes place in my least favorite locale-a hospital . That makes the gags a bit more pointed for me and makes it a bit less funny in spots . Because I want to discuss specifics gags , here there be spoilers : The Pink Panther winds up getting hurt and ends up in the hospital with the world's most obnoxious room mate . I'd force-feed this guy prunes and hide his call button . The Pink Panther then winds up being subjected to the tender " mercies " of the hospital staff . He learns the downside of switching patient charts , inattentive nurses taking your blood pressure and the problems which come from full-body casts . He's the victim of an insane hospital bed and becomes a pin-cushion , in what is an old standard gag in animation . It had whiskers twenty years before this short was made . The ending is one I don't care for-I personally would have switched it around and had the Pink Panther emerge the one with the last laugh . This short is available on the Pink Panther Classic Cartoon Collection and is probably worth seeing once , though the collection itself is excellent . Recommended for completists .
A dated curio that is not without its ' charms , but of somewhat limited interest and appeal .	This film has been of interest to me for some time now , for a number of reasons . I finally managed to get a copy and saw it yesterday . I now understand why it is not currently generally available-it is dated , of , at best , average quality , not without charm or appeal , to be sure , but the interst here is for a relatively small audience . Not a bad film , by any means , just not terribly engaging . I will say that a knowledge of Spanish greatly enhanced my own enjoyment of this film , as two or three very good lines were delivered in Spanish . I have now seen three of the five Academy Award Picture nominees in their entirety ( and am unlikely to ever see one , The Patriot , as it is reportedly a " lost " film ) and part of Alibi . I now understand how Broadway Melody won that year . Of the choices I've seen , it is clearly the best of an average lot . The Patriot may well be better , but I'm unlikely to ever be able to judge that point . I enjoyed the film , warts and all , but it is rather dated . But , for my money , any movie that gives the leading man the nickname , " El Conejito " ( Little Rabbit ) can't be too bad . Worth watching . Recommended to old film buffs and film historians .
Bosko goes down to the farm in an okay , if unspectacular short .	This is the fourth Bosko short and it has some engaging moments . Since I'll be discussing in a bit of detail one or two scenes , consider this a spoiler warning : Bosko continues to get music out of fairly atypical places , such as a horse's tail played like a violin and a pitchfork played like a guitar or banjo . Like most early Bosko shorts , this is very musical in nature and has one extended and fairly amusing bit centering around three pigs who take turns drinking from a bottle ( the " Booze " of the title ) and lurching around . First , two small pigs find the bottle and sample the contents and then a larger pig commandeers the bottle and takes a few liberal swigs before tossing the bottle . The bottle then comes into the possession of Bosko , who himself partakes of its contents and staggers over to join the pigs to join them in a spontaneous ( and off-key ) rendition of " Sweet Adeline " . A low-rent barbershop quartet . There's one brief gag that's possibly a bit unsettling with an ear of corn making an unscheduled ( and no doubt unexpected ) reappearance , but it's really rather mild by today's standards . Entertaining , if rather pedestrian in tone and substance , it would definitely be worth watching at least once .
Likable enough , I suppose , but without the magic of the black and white silents .	Although this is a decent enough cartoon , the later , color , shorts done by Van Beuren studios lack the magic and charm of the black and white silents done almost 15-20 years earlier . The studio did the best they could , but production values and a lack of cohesion make these curios rather than gems . Worth watching . Recommended to fans and for kids .
Something of a historical curiousity now , interesting but dated .	This documentary , nominated for an Academy Award , is a look back in time at the traffic problems in and around Los Angeles circa 1946 . Interesting but qute dated , it does show that Los Angeles had problems with traffic flows even 55 years ago . Turner Classic Movies runs this occasionally and invariably runs it in March as part of its " 31 Days of Oscar " programming . Worth watching .
Okay , but nothing special about this one .	This one is proof that nobody does great work all the time . UPA did wonderful work most of the time . But everyone can have an off day . Though this is cute in spots , it's not a terribly good ( or bad ) cartoon . It's just there most of the time , with a marginally interesting , ultimately silly plot . Worth watching once . For UPA fans .
One of a series of sports-related Goofy shorts	This was part of a series of shorts , some very good and others , like this one ( yawn ) not as effective . While it's an interesting idea , there isn't a great deal of energy to this one ( yawn ) and it just sort of sleepwalks along ( yawn ) to the end . If I keep writing this much longer , I'll fall asleep at the keyboard , so you'll have to excuse me . It is worth watching for the animation , though .
Visually impressive in spots , if way too cute for its own good in others .	This is an interesting take on the perils of smoking ( done some 65 years ago ) and is a very nice cartoon , particularly some of the visual sequences . But the cartoon is entirely too precious in spots for its own good . It isn't a bad cartoon , but the dichotomy of cute one moment and eerie the next is far too great a gulf for this short to work very well . Roger Corman pulled it off in some of his features simply by shooting for humor rather than sugary sweet , as they do here . Worth watching , though . Recommended to fans of the MGM Harman / Ising days .
Enjoyable , if not terribly creative or surprising .	UPA was beginning to hit the wall with Magoo shorts toward the end . The problem with the Magoo series was the inherent limitations of the basic premise . The jokes can be rather predictable and thus the quality of the material has to be extremely good or it doesn't work as well . When they were on , the shorts were great , like Trouble Indemnity or When Magoo Flew . This isn't a bad cartoon by any means . But the jokes are old and a bit marginal , which makes predictability a major liability . Worth watching , but not all that special . Recommended for Magoo fans .
Okay Tom and Jerry with a few entertaining moments .	This one , though no rousing barn-burner , won't put you to sleep either . It has a few good moments here and there . Tom's cousin speaks and though the voicework is uncredited and I don't know with anything even remotely approaching certainty who does it here , it does sound like the same voice that did Droopy , Bill Thompson . Don't bet on that , though-I don't know for sure , it just sounds like him and it is plausible . Decent cartoon that proves Tom has family too . Worth watching at least once . Recommended .
They were still trying to make Bimbo the star and they still don't really seem to know what they wanted to do with Betty yet .	Very early entry in the series . Betty Boop is still formative in this one ( dog ears are still present ) and they still seem to be feeling their way here . Bimbo is here and a focus of the short is a plot the Fleischers employ to much greater effectiveness later in the Popeye series-a run-in with a magician . They seem to be on the verge of discovering that Betty is a better character ( and certainly better to support a cartoon series ) than Bimbo , who is a reasonable secondary character , but just not substantial enough to build a series around . The bits aren't funny because of Bimbo-he's just there and only occasionally interesting on his own hook . Things just bounce off Bimbo . There's no spark . That can work if a character if there's some characteristic to grab the audience . After all , Mickey Mouse was largely just a foil for gags or a straight man after a while , but Disney invested him with enough personality early on that he grabbed an audience . Bimbo never had that going for him . Good cartoon-nothing special , but worth a look . Recommended to Boop fans .
Two early appearances of well-known characters	This short features a very early version of Daffy Duck ( call it Daffy 1 . 0 ) and also Egghead , who would evolve into Elmer Fudd a bit later on . This features one of the zaniest duels of all time ! The turtle almost steals the show here ! Typical Tex Avery sight gags . A bit more talky than the aerage Avery short , but very good . Well worth seeing . Recommended .
A collection of caricatures , sight gags and a bit of music	This short doesn't really have a plot to speak of , but is instead a series of sight gags , celebrity caricatures and a version of the song which provides the title . Consider this a spoiler warning : The cartoon is a bunch of gags loosely connected by radios . The viewer is bounced around the world from one radio to the next . Some of the bits would probably be offensive to some in this day and age , like scenes involving Chinese policemen and African natives and a slightly risqué ( for 1933 , anyway ) scene with a harem girl . There are also celebrity caricatures , including Ben Bernie , a takeoff on Bing Crosby ( here , he's Cros Bingby ) , Greta Garbo , Zazu Pitts and Mae West , plus quite a few who clearly were caricatures whom I didn't recognize . Oh-there's also a scene where Jimmy Cagney and an actress have a bit together . The performance of " I've Got to Sing a Torch Song " is done by , among others , Garbo , Pitts and West and the end title has Garbo saying , " That's all , folks ! " All in all , a nice little short , if nothing special . Well worth watching once . Recommended .
Interesting variation on the " books / magazines come to life " plot line-this one uses travel brochures	There were a good number of shorts which used the conceit of having characters in books or magazines ( sometimes on items in a grocery store ) come to life and interact with each other . This is a rather novel variant , in that it uses travel brochures . As I want to discuss some details , there will be spoilers below : The beginning is a series of quick sight gags , generally with some kind of appropriate musical connection which fit the gag , most of them at least mildly amusing , the standout being " When Yuba Plays the Rhumba On the Tuba " . The middle portion consists of a takeoff on the title , re-wording the song it was taken from as " Food's An Education In Itself " , where we see two characters filling their plates from various brochures where puns make a connection to food possible ( " Turkey " , for example ) while a trio sing to accompany the animation . The last part is strictly a crime / chase sub-plot , involving the Thief of Baghdad stealing from the Kimberly Diamond Mines , only to be chased from brochure to brochure and finally caught , dragged along until he winds up seated behind the " Lone Stranger " . As they ride off , the Thief points out that he isn't " alone " anymore . This short is available on the Looney Tunes Golden Collection , Volume 4 and is well worth watching . Recommended .
A short where the story is almost more important than the animation	This short , nominated for an Academy Award , is a story first and foremost , for all that there's no notable dialogue . The animation is relatively simple and straightforward ( although the detail of the backgrounds is quite good ) and the events unfold as the short goes on . I'm still not quite sure what to make of the ending and find the short a trifle unsettling , but it's well worth watching . Produced by the National Film Board of Canada , it used to run on the Cartoon Network periodically on O Canada . Recommended .
Frank Tashlin later became a director of live-action feature films and his sensibilities show through in a number of his animated shorts , including this one	This short is one of Frank Tashlin's better efforts as a director , though not his absolute best . This ( and many other shorts ) show that Tashlin approached animated shorts with the eye and sensibility of a director of live-action features , which he generally did , because that's what he ultimately aimed to be and later became-a director of live-action features . Because I want to discuss some details of this short , there will be minor spoilers : This short succeeds as an animated short , but has the " look " of having been shot like a live-action feature . The director used a lot of the conventions of both animation and of feature film . It's a beautifully laid out piece of work , with two separate setups which later have montages of the scenes to speed up the action-first , early on , we see squirrels gathering and storing nuts in a number of short and very effective vignettes , which are then superimposed in a small section , one after another , in a montage to indicate lots of activity without using up a great deal of the short's running time and then , later in the cartoon , we see the main character , a young squirrel given more towards gambling , rather than working hard , as a means to gather nuts for the winter , who is being systematically fleeced in a series of games like roulette and craps , which play through once at normal speed and then are depicted rapidly in a montage . The basic story is fairly straightforward-it's summer and the squirrels are busy gathering and storing nuts in preparation for the coming of winter . One young enterprising fellow sees no percentage in working , when he can just win the nuts of other squirrels with a pair of dice . His father does not share his viewpoint and is less than pleased with his son's attitude . No amount of persuasion or punishment can get through to the young squirrel . At the onset of winter , the father sends his son to get the family's stash of nuts from the bank , with orders to go there and return home immediately . Junior decides to engage in some games of chance with a stranger he meets on the way home . He , of course , loses everything but the sense of taste in his mouth and trudges sadly home to answer to his father , whom he tries to fool with absolutely the worst cover story ever committed to celluloid . The end of the short is wonderful , so I won't spoil it here . This short is available on the Looney Tunes Golden Collection , Volume 4 and is well worth watching . Recommended .
Entertaining short , athough occasionally too cute for words .	Pete Smith was a master at making shorts-often comical , sometimes serious and usually acerbic and satirical in his running commentary . Some are brilliant , such as Audioscopicks . Some were intensely cute , like this one . They were invariably good and many were nominated for Oscars , as was this one . It's about a stray dog who needs to find himself a master . The narration becomes entirely too cute for my tastes at times , but all in all , this is still a very good piece of work by a man who was very good at his craft .
Fascinating short with excellent visual design .	This short is a very effective and funny piece of work with some fascinating bits . I will be discussing details , so this is a spoiler warning : The Pink Panther comes upon a door with an eye and enters a realm of the odd and wonderful as a result . He comes upon a character who resembles " The Little White Guy " with a beard and dressed as a beatnik . The Pink Panther pulls down a book on " fire rituals " and hands it to the beatnik , who opens it with predictable results . Not being one to hold a grudge , the guy hands our hero a book on " The Love Lives of Panthers " . Much of the rest of the cartoon revolves around the Pink Panther's attempts to read this book . He and the book fall through a hole , only to have the book " injured " severely enough to necessitate " surgery " , which is done by the beatnik , with some assistance from our pink friend . A light bulb in a lamp burns out and the PP tries without success to replace it by using a machine marked " Lights " , from which he gets almost every kind of light except a light bulb . He finally gets one by having an " idea " occur to him and taking the resulting light bulb from above his head ! Off and on , various calamities befall the beatnik , courtesy of the star of the series , until the poor guy finally loses his temper and goes after him with a most unusual weapon . The ending of the short is a bit mixed , but the final shot is quite nice . This short is on the PInk Panther Classic Cartoon Collection and is most definitely worth checking out . Recommended .
Good , if typical , Disney adaptatin of a classic tale	Nominated for an Academy Award , this is a good , though not great , adaptation of Dickens as seen through the lense of Disney . Better than average re-telling of A Christmas Carol , though the Disney hand is visible a bit heavily in spots . Enjoyable , if far from a masterpiece . Recommended .
A good example proving that reading the Owner's Manual first is often a good idea !	This is a wonderful little bonus to Monsters , Inc . included by Pixar on VHS and DVD release . This is almost as funny as For The Birds and as rich in detail . While I like cel animation slightly more than CGI ( odd , because I have zero artistic ability and can't draw a straight line even with a ruler ) , Pixar's work enthralls me . Pixar succeeds because they understand that a story is necessary , or even the greatest animation ( or whatever ) crashes in a heap at the foot of the stairs and can't get back up . This point appears to elude entirely too many people of late , including the folks at Disney ( Pixar , it should be noted , is not part of Disney , but is a separate company that has a distribution deal with The Mouse . ) and it's not that hard to make sure you have a story first , though all too often it must seem that way in the film industry . I hope Pixar continues to do shorts , whether for R & D purposes or just because they want to do them , as they do a great job . Well worth watching . Recommended .
A different take on an old standard and a relatively novel approach for UPA as well .	UPA was , in many ways , different from the other studios in its approach . This cartoon is a relative rarity for them in its use of music . While UPA shorts did use scoring and music was part of the package , music wasn't as significant for them as it was for other studios like MGM , Disney or Warner Brothers . Apart from the Ham and Hattie series , which was basically two shorts in one and were songs that were animated , I can only think of two shorts by UPA where music was not only involved in the plot , but crucial to the success of the short : Rooty Toot Toot and this one . The animators even put a somewhat subtle spin on the song as well , by their animation and the implications included through character behavior . Not typically the idea one gets from the lyrics of the song , at least not an impression I ever got . Typically excellent animation and a marvelous short . Well worth hunting down . Recommended .
Cute cartoon , but the original source story is better	While this cartoon , nominated for an Oscar , is a good adaptation of a classic short story with the same title and is very cute and worth seeing , the source material ( Butler's story ) is simply marvelous and should also be read . Disney did a good job in adaptation , given their track record for adaptations . Worth watching , this runs periodically on The Ink and Paint Club on the Disney Channel .
Donald as scoutmaster ; his usualcharming , genial self !	In this short , nominated for an Oscar , Donald is the Scout leader of a troop consisting of his nephews , Huey , Dewey and Louey . As is typically the case , Donld is affable , good-natured , even-tempered and thoroughly prepared . Cartoondom's most prominent case of coronary thrombosis in waiting , its ' poster child for hypertension , is in rare form . The boys are better equipped than he is for what happens on their hike . The end of the short is hilarious . This runs from time to time on The Ink and Paint Club and is well worth watching .
Very good display of trick shots in bowling by a master	This short was nominated for an Oscar as a novelty short . It's basically showing a very good bowler doing the trick shots he was well-known for at the time . Andy Varipapa was a professional bowler who made a decent living doing shows from town to town performing trick shots in front of audiences and this features some of his better ones . Pete Smith's narration is well-suited here . This runs on Turner Classic Movies periodically and almost always in March as filler between movies . Recommended .
Excellent example of a staple of the early animated shorts	This short is jammed with caricatures of notables-mostly actors and actresses , but J . Edgar Hoover is here too , as are Leopold Stowkowski and Sally Rand . Not only stars ( Gable , Garbo and Grant ) but character actors ( the almost mandatory Ned Sparks appearance is here ) as well . It was an excellent concept , tailor-made for the animators . Their audience would recognize the caricatures and get the jokes easily . This is one of the better ones . Most , if not all the animation studios did at least one or two such shorts . Well worth looking for . Most recommended .
Those who can , do ; those who can't , teach in cartoons .	If Jerry is moonlighting here , he'd best not count on keeping his teaching position unless he already has tenure ! Things don't run to form for Jerry as everything he tries to " teach " to " Tuffy " turns out badly for him ( some of it rather painfully so ) and in the end , the student is far more successful . I love the ending . which is 180 degrees opposite the typical Tom and Jerry ! Good sight gags , a fair number centering around The Mouse Formerly Known As Nibbles . Well worth watching . Recommended .
Very good ( and very short ) little animated short well worth seeing .	This short won the BAFTA for Animated Short and was nominated for the Academy Award as well ( losing out to Bob's Birthday , if I'm not mistaken ) and was well deserving of both nominations , though I think two of the other BAFTA nominees were probably better than this and Monk and the Fish should have won . This is very brief ( about two minutes long or so ) , but it's awfully funny and Frank Gorshin still does an excellent Kirk Douglas impression . Well worth seeing and if I write much more , reading my comment will take longer than watching the short will . Recommended .
Hackneyed , cliched , trite-but somehow , it works and you can dance to itt	This movie is really , on the face of it , collection of well-worn characters , plot devices and cliched , old scenarios and it should really just sink to the bottom with only a gurgling sound or two . But , amazingly enough , it works just well enough to be worth watching . Most of the performances are at least good and some are very good . Liv Tyler does the best of the principal cast , but three of the supporting roles give it life and one of them all but steals the movie . Bill Cobb as a jazz musician and Rita Wilson ( Tom Hanks ' wife in real life ) as a waitress have very good parts and shine in their scenes . But Obba Babatunde as Lamarr , the hotel doorman is great and all but walks off with the movie . The music is very good all through the movie , with the title track getting an Oscar nomination . It's played throughout the movie and is infectious . It's got a beat and you can dance to it . I give it a 77 .
Good ( not great ) early Disney	This is the first Mickey Mouse short to actually be nominated for an Oscar , losing to Flowers and Trees . The real " mouse that roared " does nothing very special or elaborate in this cartoon . It's cute and enjoyable and I suppose it's representative of the black and white efforts which Disney was doing at the time . Probably more impressive in 1931 , it's still worth watching today . It runs on the INK AND PAINT CLUB on Disney Channel . Recommended .
The last of the Bugs / Wile E . shorts	In this short , Bugs Bunny takes the place of the Road Runner because of an injury ( no doubt work-related , for which the Road Runner was probably on Worker's Compensation ) and Wile E . still has no more luck at chasing rabbits than he does Road Runners . More dialogue than the typical Road Runner short , but has lots of sight gags in any case . Well worth watching . Recommended .
There's nothing quite like a Paul Driessen animated short !	Some animators have a very distinctive look or style to their work that makes them unmistakable with anyone else's work . Tex Avery is one-while early Tex Avery can sometimes be generic , mostly his work is quite recognizable . Paul Driessen is another animator whose style is immediately and clearly marked as his . Character design is one feature that is a dead giveaway to Driessen . This particular short , nominated for an Academy Award , is typically Driessen in approach , style , tone and substance . Darkly funny and occasionally unsettling , this has a few running gags and a sub-plot that ties the three separate story lines together rather effectively . Filled with tons of allusions to fairy tales and quite charming in a somewhat twisted sort of way . Not great Driessen , but very good nonetheless . Recommended .
Commercially-contracted short I first saw in a high school geology class	This short was sponsored by either an oil company or mining operation to produce an educational short about geology . The Hubleys did a marvelous job . The veteran character actor Jack Warden is the voice of " Rocko " , our underground tour guide , explaining terms such as igneous and sedimentary to the audience . I first saw this in a high school geology class . It was included in The Cosmic Eye and is available on DVD and is worth the effort to get . Recommended .
Excellent use of rotoscoping that has its moments , but an acquired taste not for everyone	This movie is probably most notable for Mark Hamill providing vocals for a character , although another film was his best-known project that same year . Ralph Bakshi's use of rotoscoping is probably the best part of the production . The movie is hysterically funny in spots , but is deadly boring in others and is wildly uneven . On the whole , I found it enjoyable , but I've seen better . Not for kids ( at least chronological ones ) by any means , but somewhat tame for Bakshi . Recommended to those with an interest in movies , period-the good , the bad and the strange . This one is all three at some point in time .
Cute , not without charm and typical of Pixar's attention to detail .	While this is not Pixar's best short , it is still more than worthwhile viewing . As I understand it , Pixar does shorts to test run things before trying them in a feature ( it's much cheaper to see what works-or does not-in a short ) and because they want to . Boundin ' is visually a treat . A run time under five minutes all but requires a sketchy story . War and Peace , it's not . It's a pleasant attempt at a parable aimed at the modern attention span . Sure , it's familiar . Very little is truly original . Watch the detail in the background or try and catch the in-jokes . Boundin ' was nominated for an Oscar . I think the nomination was deserved . It's on the release of the film The Incredibles , so check it out . Recommended .
The best things about this short are the music and the script	This short , produced by the NFBC , uses a style of stop-motion that , at least to my eye , is distracting and not entirely effective . But the music is spendid and the basic concept and script are engaging enough to overcome some very definite visual drawbacks . Makes some pithy and cogent remarks on humanity's character and values ( or lack thereof ) , but could have been better , for me at least , had the animation been less irksome . Well worth seeing .
Excellent use of caricatures in a " magazines come to life " short	A gimmick that Warner Brothers animators used quite often was the idea that characters / images come to life after business hours off of magazine covers , books or even grocery store labels and boxes . Quite often , they used caricatures of celebrities who would have been well-known to audiences in those days and they did so here , though not every character in this one is a caricature . I can't swear to it , but I suspect that all of the magazine titles featured in this one actually existed . I recognized most of them as having been magazines available on newsstands and elsewhere . The rest of my comments may contain spoilers , so you have been warned : The plot is pretty basic and predictable . What makes this cartoon interesting is the juxtaposition of titles to make up gags , like a crook coming out of " The Gang " and passing " Popular Mechanics " to grab a torch and having " Wall Street " close by , with a safe on the cover to crack . Charlie Chan captures him , he's tried by the " Judge " and sentenced to " Life " , but manages to sneak over to " Liberty " in order to make his escape . Things like that come together frequently . A lot of the standard caricatures are here ( including Ned Sparks-it must have been a requirement to have Ned Sparks appear somewhere in one of these , as he's in most of the ones I've seen ) and you'll be treated to the likes of Leopold Stowkowski , Greta Garbo , Clark Gable , Hugh Herbert and others . William Powell is here as Nick Charles from " The Thin Man " , along with his dog Asta . Everyone from the Boy Scouts to Santa Claus joins in on the chase when the villain escapes . How he is caught is hilarious and I won't spoil that gag . There's a cute ending involving Hugh Herbert as well . This short is on the Looney Tunes Golden Collection , Vol . 3 and is well worth getting . The Collections themselves are extremely well done and worth every penny . Recommended .
The music is excellent and the animation isn't bad either	This short is an early Warner Brothers that features a character named Bosko , who is in ill favor in certain politically correct quarters . My take on it all is that the few shorts I've seen in the series vary greatly in quality , some being very good and others not terribly interesting . This is one of the better ones I've seen . Warner Brothers almost always had excellent music throughout their run , up to the 1950s and this short has excellent music , if a limited plot . Well worth watching . Recommended .
Speedy's Oscar-and how it won I'll never know !	This cartoon won the Oscar in the same year that " Legend of Rockabye Point " and " Good Will To Men " were eligible , which atonises me no end ! While it's a good cartoon , either of those two run rings around this enjoyable , but unexceptional piece of work . I have no idea why it happened , but it is one of the more surprising flubs in the Animated Short category's history . sigh Oh , well . A pleasing and enjoyable cartoon anyway and well worth watching .
Fun for everyone except Nibbles .	This is one of a series of shorts where Tom and Nibbles are " the king's Mouseketeers " with Tom as their main foil ( sorry ) . While this is not the best of them , I personally love this one , because I have a soft spot in my heart for Nibbles ( the little mouse who gets all the hazardous duty here and none of the benefits ) in this one . The ending is quite appropriate here . I don't blame Nibbles one bit , either . Well worth watching . Recommended .
A Screen Song with wonderful animation and an absolutely dead live-action sing-along .	The Fleischer Studios did a series of cartoons called " Screen Songs " , which featured a combination of animation and a section where the lyrics of a song ( usually a song featured as the title of the short ) rolled up on the screen and paced by a " bouncing ball " . Though the song lyric sections were initially animated , for a while they mixed live footage of singers or groups in with the animation . This is one of those shorts . Because I want to discuss some of the details of this , this is a spoiler warning : This short starts and ends very well , with animated sequences and a great deal of jazzy scat singing being done by various animals , all to the musical strains of the song , " You're Driving Me Crazy " . There's a dancing lion which looks a bit like Betty Boop , monkeys and a whole host of other animals , including at least one Cab Calloway sound-alike . It's all great fun-until the live-action sequence starts . While there were some of these shorts where the live-action worked ( like the ones with Louis Armstrong and Cab Calloway ) this is not very good at all . They went from a very fast and energetic pace in the animation to a slow ballade rendition of the song by a talented , if bland , female singer whom I didn't recognize . Thankfully , the sing-along portion is under two minutes . Then we get back to the high energy of the animation . I don't want to spoil any of the individual gags , so I'll just say that this is a fairly typical early Fleischer so far as the visuals are concerned , which means some really odd and funny things happen throughout . This short is well worth tracking down for the animated sequences . Recommended .
A musical remake of The Philadelphia Story with Bing Crosby , Frank Sinatra and Louis Armstrong !	This is a musical remake of the film , The Philadelphia Story . It's worth watching for the music alone ! The basic plot and even significant amounts of dialogue from the earlier film are incorporated here , but the music is the highlight here ! Particularly the duet between Sinatra and Crosby on " What a Swell Party This Is " and the song " Now You Has Jazz " by Crosby and the subsequent duet he has with Armstrong . Great fun was had by all ! Well worth watching , especially if you love jazz !
My sympathies are largely with the bear here	I intend to discuss details from this particular short , so let this be your spoiler warning : This is a relatively early Heckle and Jeckle short with a fairly straightforward premise-Heckle and Jeckle wind up blowing out a tire on the car they are in and go up to a bear's cave to try and find a place to stay for the night . There is a large sign requesting quiet because someone is trying to sleep . Naturally , this sign is ignored and they start knocking loudly , waking the bear . Even after the door is opened , they continue knocking on the bear himself . He refuses to let them in and slams the door on them . They spy through a window and see a full refrigerator , so they pretend to be Mounties in pursuit of " Killer " to gain entry . The bear figures it out and the chase is on . The remainder of the short is one sight gag after another . The short ultimately ends up badly for Heckle and Jeckle , as quite frequently happens when their adversary is a sympathetic one . Most entertaining cartoon with some humorous bits . Well worth tracking down . Recommended .
Takeoff on the " Ripley's Believe It or Not "	Tex Avery loved to do spoofs of things and this one was a spoof of Robert Ripley's column / program , " Believe It or Not " , where he detailed odd or unusual events , items and the like for his readers ' edification . This is Avery doing the same , but Avery's way . The running gag ( Avery almost always used one in his shorts ) consists of Egghead ( Elmer Fudd in the larval stage ) periodically showing up to scoff at various claims , saying , " I don't believe it ! " The ending is probably the best gag , the rest being either mildly amusing or falling a bit flat , with one or two not working in the slightest . Egghead basically makes this one worth watching . Decent idea , with some funny gags , but the parts are definitely greater than the sum . Average Avery , which means that it's equal to quite a few other directors ' better work , but a simple finger exercise for the maestro , Still worth watching . Recommended .
Bizarre even by Plympton's standards	Bill Plympton's work is , even at its tamest , exceptionally strange and odd . It would be fair to call him animation's David Lynch , save that even Lynch isn't this weird ! This short is even more the oddity than normal , even for Plympton . The most accurate description is to say it defies description . This grows on you after a bit-nose hair as anti-hero , an unusual scenario indeed . Plympton is an acqured taste , to be sure , but this one is recommended for the adventurous . I found it on Spike and Mike's Festival of Animation Vol , 4 . Worth watching .
All too close to reality , unfortunately	This short is another example of the excellent work done by the National Film Board of Canada . The sad fact is , this is only fictional on the surface points . All too many species are disappearing unnecessarily and have been for some time . This makes that point deftly . Well worth hunting down and locating . Recommended .
Very good ( although a somewhat loose ) adaptation of the story with incredible detail in the Claymation	This short ( actually close to 30 minutes in length ) was nominated for an Academy Award and deserved to be . The attention to detail is high , which is typical of a Will Vinton project . Narrated by Will Geer ( a perfect choce , by the way ) , the story is adapted rather loosely in spots , but it's a marvelous piece of work and I'm glad it's apparently still in-print . A worthy effort well worth seeing . Most recommended .
Probably the best of the sports cartoons Disney has made .	This short , nominated for an Oscar , is likely the best of the sports cartoons Disney did ( most of them centered around the lithe , atheletic and graceful Goofy ) and is a classic , although Tex Avery was there ahead of them , with Screwball Football in 1939 . Tex more than holds his own , but How To Pay Football is hilarious and yet another in a long line of works with which Disney can be justifiably proud . This airs on the Ink and Paint Club periodically . Recommended .
Disney's first take on Noah	This short was Disney's first visit to Noah-it was followed up 26 years later by Noah's Ark . Of the two , this one is much closer to the typical Disney animated short and this one is very good . The other is more unusual in style and format , but both are fairly successful in what they try to do . Good to see this in-print . Beautifully executed . Recommended .
One of the best Tex Avery cartoons that Avery didn't make .	This short was made at the Walter Lantz studio during Tex Avery's brief stint as a director there and though he wasn't involved , his influence is seen throughout . As I want to discuss some of the details , this is a spoiler warning : This is a story told in flashback ( for the most part ) and is about two dogs , John and Mary , who start out at the bottom of the list in vaudeville ( I suspect the idea of making them dogs was a deliberate joke , as the dog act on the vaudeville circuit was normally placed at the end of the show , to clear the theater out for the next performance ) and gradually rise to the top and play the Palace , doing the same act throughout . John is then foolish enough to walk out on Mary for another woman , who's just using him until he's out of money . John then tries to go back to Mary , only to find she's a successful solo act . He tries a solo and bombs , tries again to contact Mary repeatedly , with no luck and decides to jump off a bridge , which is where we find him at the start of the short . Near the beginning , on the stage backdrop in a vaudeville house John and Mary perform in , one of the ads touts " Avery's Liver Tonic " , which is appropriate , because Tex Avery's stylistic fingerprints are all through this short . The gags recall several shorts Avery made while he was at MGM , most specifically his Symphony In Slang . The narration even sounds the same ! Now that I think of it , the principal female character in Symphony In Slang is named Mary , though I don't recall if the narrator is named John . It's a very funny cartoon . The ending of this short is mixed , for my tastes . I would have ended the short about ten or fifteen seconds sooner ! I won't spoil the gag here . This short was released on one of the Columbia House Woody Woodpecker and Friends DVDs and is well worth watching . Most recommended .
Books often don't translae to film too well , but an excellent job was done here	This is an excellent adaptation of a very good novel by Frederic Forsythe . All too often , novels are poorly adapted to film , for various reasons . This is one of the better examples of how things can work but don't . The plot is discernably that of Forsythe's book ( the author has not always been fortunate in that regard < shudder ! > ) and the suspense carries through the film . Edwrd Fox is marvelous as The Jackal , the rest of the cast largely do an excellent job , script and score are great and other production values are qite good . Cyril Cusack has a fairly small part but is excellent and so is Derek Jacobi in a small role . Highly recommended .
Talk about self-fulfilling prophecies !	This cartoon ( the title is a play on the film title " Each Dawn I Die " ) is one of the better Elmer Fudd solos the did . It concerns a rather foolish rooster , the hazards of jumping to conclusions and the danger of inattention . The narration is excellent , visual gags are here in abundance and the payoff is a scream for everyone but John Rooster . It's usually a good idea to be aware of your surroundings . A delightful little short . Well worth looking for . Recommended .
Daffy really should quit while he's behind	This is the middle cartoon of the three ( between Rabbit Fire and Duck ! Rabbit , Duck ! ) and is the weakest of the three , while still being quite funny . It simply depends on one gag for too much of the action . Still a good cartoon . I feel a definite sympathy for Daffy in this one , which is rare for me . Daffy is so clearly overmatched that it almost becomes painful to watch at times . Good cartoon in an excellent series . Recommended .
Alan Arkin and Audrey Hepburn make this worth seeing , although the film is really quite good in other respects also	Audrey Hepburn was nominated for an Oscar and how Alan Arkin missed out on one for Supporting Actor I'll never understand . The performances carry the film , although there is a very good supporting cast , afairly decent script and production values are good . The performances by epburn and Arkin raise the film from average to excellent . Recommended
Pepe Le Pew's only Oscar bid was a winner !	This cartoon won an Oscar for Pepe Le Pew almost ten years before Bugs Bunny won for Knighty Knight Bugs . Pepe is one of my favorite characters and this is one of the better cartoons in the series , although not my personal favorite ( that's Touche and Go ) . Pepe discovers wht it's like to have the shoe on the other foot in this one . Great fun in this one . It should be in-print . It has been in the past , most notably on the tape A Salute to Chuck Jones from the Golden Jubilee series . Cartoon Network shows it fairly often . Recommended .
One of their best , it's got the best opening credits sequence of all time	Though I happen to like other Marx Bros . films better , this ranks right up there with their best ! The credits at the beginning are some of the best i've seen ! Typical Marx action , lots of slapstick and visual action mixed with Groucho's wisecracks , much of which I suspect was ad-libbed . Very funny and well worth your time .
Who would have thought that elves were so partial to doughnuts ?	This short , nominated for an Academy Award , is an adaptation of the fairy tale about the shoemaker and the elves . It's one of Lantz studios musical shorts and features a lot of the basic sight gags that have become so familiar if you've watched any of the adaptations of this particular story before . Good cartoon , well animated and entertaining , especially for those who really like doughnuts ! Worth watching . Recommended .
Formative Pepe Le Pew cartoon and another example of the Law of Unintended Consequences .	This short , a formative cartoon featuring Pepe Le Pew , concerns a cat who thinks he'll solve all his problems by pretending to be a skunk . Trouble is , he attracts the most unwelcome attention of an honest and for truly skunk ( our hero , Pepe , entering stage left ) being decidedly more attentive , shall we say , than M . Cat would like . Every great plan has its drawbacks , but this one's a corker ! I wonder if Jack Warner got a call from the Hays Office over the fact that Pepe and the object of his adoration were both male . After all , Betty Boop was in part responsible for the Production Code coming into existance . Subsequent " conquests " were clearly and most definitely female . Very good cartoon , but Pepe is a character who works better as the focal point , rather than supporting . Well worth watching . Recommended .
Not so much a remake of Sock-a-bye Baby as it is a variation on a theme .	The Fleischers , toward the end of the studio's existence , for whatever reason , chose to do one or two thematically similar shorts that copied ( somewhat ) earlier shorts in the Popeye series . Given that Famous Studios practically strip-mined the old Fleischers for ideas ( and usually just pointed up how poor their shorts were in comparison ) , Max and Dave can be given some slack here . Particularly as this cartoon is perhaps slightly better , given that it has Jack Mercer and a funnier ending . The animation is superb , though the sight gags in the earlier short are more effective . Both are very good work . Well worth seeking out . Most recommended .
One of Danny Kaye's best films	Danny Kaye ( with a good deal of assistance from his wife Sylvia Fine , who wrote most of his musical numbers ) was one of the finest musical comedians ever and is in fine form here in one of his best vehicles . He plays twin brothers and is quite manic at times . The special effects deservedly won an Oscar and the musical numbers are great ! Especially the one during the opera . The Marx Brothers aside , opera has never been more fun ! This film is a treat and is most happily recommended !
The first of four encounters ( five if you're a stickler ) between Bugs and Taz	This is the first of four ( or five , if you include a cartoon done in 1979 as part of a special half-hour Christmas cartoon ) battles between Bugs and the Tasmanian Devil and in many ways it's the best of them . While Taz is really a one-note character in these and was only in five cartoons between 1954 and 1964 , the cartoons are all very good . The ones with Bugs pretty much all revolve around Taz's efforts to have rabbit added to his diet . Mostly sight gags , mainly revolving around food , but Taz has some good lines , particularly in the effort . The ending on this one is very funny . Recommended .
Entertaining , enjoyable one-shot cartoon	This short is a one-shot , that is to say that the characters and situation were not continuing as part of a series , but principally just the one cartoon . It's a thoroughly engaging and entertaining short with excellent use of music ( more or less automatic for Warner Brothers animation for most of their existence ) as is appropriate , given the title . Pinto Colvig is best known to most people as the voice of Goofy , but did a fair amount of voice work elsewhere . Well worth seeking out . Most recommended
Betty Boop in a grass skirt and doing a hula dance	This is a great cartoon featuring Betty in all her glory . There is a phrase , " Anything can happen in a cartoon " and that describes the early Fleischers in general and the Betty Boop series in particular . These cartoons are animated insanity in some cases and are quite engaging for the viewer , because anything ( well , almost anything ) is likely to happen and the charm is trying to catch lots of little things . In print and available . Well worth watching . Recommended .
Haunting story about man's inhumanity to man and the strength found to survive almost anything	How this short failed to win the Academy Award for Documentary Short , I'll never know . At times chillingly matter of fact about the historical truths and the statistics surrounding the genocide in Rwanda , ultimately you come away feeling some hope after hearing the stories of five women who have been given body blows by life and have managed to not only survive , but to gain ground in a country where women were little regarded . Because I want to discuss some of the details , this is a spoiler warning : The events which took place in Rwanda have already been well-chronicled elsewhere , so I won't say much beyond this-a systematic attempt was made to obliterate an entire tribe , planned in a methodical and deliberate campaign by the Rwandan government in an attempt to consolidate its power and outright murder was not the only weapon they used . As in most things great and small , the Law of Unintended Consequences showed up in the aftermath here . Given the horrific number of casualties , women are now a significant majority of the population and now hold positions which they could never have obtained prior to the genocide , because it was a male-dominated society . Now , there is no choice-if the jobs aren't filled by women , many of them won't get done . The women tell their own stories and basically relate them in a very matter of fact tone of voice , even though the stories they tell are almost invariably violent and grisly . They have survived and even thrived in adversity . One story , which is about par for the five which we are shown , touched me a little more because of the last words we hear from the woman , who , in a very self-effacing manner , describes herself as " not wonderful " . From her tone and her words , I gather that she doesn't see what she's done and is doing as anything worthy of notice or praise , to which I respectfully disagree . She and all the other survivors profiled are precisely that - " wonderful " . I cannot recommend this excellent short more strongly . By all means see it , if you get the opportunity . Most highly recommended .
Excellent combination of strengths !	This short was deservedly nominated for an Academy Award and is an excellent effort . The Hubleys teamed up well with Gary Trudeau . They were able to take the comic strip characters and animate them while still making a cartoon that was recognizably a Hubley cartoon . This was the last thing John Hubley finished before his death . Trudeau and the Hubleys meshed together quite well and it is unfortunate that they didn't get an opportunity to do more as a team . Worth the effort to locate . Most Highly Recommended .
Greater damage is done trying to do good in life ( and cartoons ) !	I believe it was Thoreau who said , " If I knew that a man were coming to my home with the fixed intention of doing me good , I would flee for my very life . " Tom develops amnesia and Jerry and Mammy try to " help " him recover his memory . While Jerry's efforts are not entirely altruistic ( Tom's rather irritating behaving like a rather large mouse ) Tom is better off as a cat . But the best laid plans of mice and men don't go very well here , with painfully obvious and hilarious results . Lots of great sight gags and semi-vocal effects for Tom . Well worth looking for and most recommended .
An Oscar winner and one of the best Magoo shorts they did	This short won the Oscar and probably deserved to . It's an excellent effort and one of the shining moments of the Mister Magoo series of theaterically released shorts . It is hilarious and quite mad and chaotic , even for a Magoo cartoon . Most recommended .
Tex Avery gave us the Bugs Bunny we all know and most of us love !	While Tex didn't do the first Bugs cartoon , he did the first one with many of the characteristics of Bugs that make him Bugs , including the catch-phrase , " What's up , Doc " . So it's fitting and proper that , while Chuck Jones did more with the wabbit , Tex Avery did the first Bugs to get a date at the Academy Awards , losing to the wrong feline cartoon . sigh Bugs wouldn't win an Oscar for another 18 years , but that's for another comment at another time . Highly recommended .
Tashlin at the top of his form !	Frank Tashlin is not one of the first names that come to mind when discussing Warner Brothers cartoons . with Tex Avery , Chuck Jones , Bob Clampett and Friz Freleng being more well-known . That's not a surprise at all . But it's a bit sad to think that the general public doesn't know more of him , particularly his work in animation . He worked , like many people , for more than one studio and also made the successful switch to live-action direction . A very talented man , to say the least . This short is vintage Tashlin and he handles the material perfectly . Everything here is great . The ending , where Goering and Goebbels suffer a momentary bout of candor that costs them dearly , is absolutely priceless ! Hatta Mari is a precursor to Jessica Rabbit , as is Tex Avery's Red character . Only Mari IS BAD-as well as drawn that way ! Pay particular attention to the scene in the squadron barracks when the commander displays her wanted poster . Marvelous short and well worth tracking down . Most highly recommended .
Typical Bugs any very funny	This is an exceptional Bugs Bunny cartoon and is very funny . One of the better bits is when Bugs enters the concert hall dressed as Leopold Stowkowski and the crowd continually whispers , " Leopold " . This cartoon has some nice operatic bits as well as Bugs singing " What Do They Do On a Rainy Night in Rio ? " Now why in the world would anyone want to miss that ? Recommended
Disney again does an excellent job of adapting Pooh	Disney has been criticized ( often justifiably ) for the sometimes very loose adaptations of other works to animation . But they generally have done quite well by the Winnie-the-Pooh adaptations . This short , nominated for an Academy Award in the excellent year of 1974 , is a first-class adaptation of the denizens of the 100-Acre Wood . Personally , Tigger is my second favorite character ( after Eeyore ) so I particularly like this one . Disney used animation to actually create the feel of the A . A . Milne books and did very well by the stories . Highly Recommended .
Twenty years after the first manned moon landing , there came the best documentary about Apollo , and by extension , the space program that I've ever seen !	Nothing I can say could possibly do this documentary justice , but I'm going to try anyway . One of the greatest ( in more than one sense ) and most profound of human endeavors that has ever been undertaken is the effort at spaceflight . The most notable achievement is the landing and return of humans to the Moon . This documentary recaptures the awe and wonder I felt ( and still feel today ) when I watched the landing . Nominated for Documentary Feature , it should have won ( or at least tied ) . As good as Common Threads was and is , for For All Mankind not to have won says more about the Academy and present-day society's fixation on now and its indifference to both yesterday and tomorrow . In a disposable society where creativity is less honored than timliness and for whom all too many , the past is what they had for breakfast , twenty years may as well be two thousand . Sic Transit Gloria ( Thus Passeth Glory ) . Most , most highly RECOMMENDED ! ! !
Very innovative ( and cute ) CGI short	This is a very impressive example computer animation . It is also an extremely cute cartoon ( bordering on precious at times ) and was nominated for the Academy Award . Fairly early effort by Pixar and quite good even some 15 years later . Well worth searching for . I believe it's included in front of one of the Pixar features on the VHS and DVD releases . Most recommended .
Thoroughly and delightfully bizarre	This short , which won a well deserved Academy Award , has got to be one of the most delightfully twisted cartoons I have seen in my life ! Through a series of twists and turns so odd that it seems like a combination of Kafka and Hitchcock , we follow three people-a husband , his wife and the mailman-through a most eventful day for them all . It changes their lives most completely . Black humor runs throughout this absolute gem and it is delightfully funny ! Though I wonder if the Canadian Postal union feels the same about this one ! Most recommended !
Another remarkable production for Disney to be justifiably proud and that should be in print .	This is one of Disney's finest efforts . It shows just how incredibly diverse and compelling this planet we inhabit truly is and the camera work is atounding ! Of course , as is the Mouse's nature , it is not in print . The best one can manage is that it runs from time to time on the Disney Channel during " Vault Disney " in the wee hours . It is most decidedly worth seeing . There are more things in heaven and on Earth than are dreamt of in our philosophy . How true ! Recommended !
Atypical Disney short , in more ways than one .	There will be spoilers to one degree or another in here . During World War II , Disney produced a number of cartoons for general release that were propaganda aimed at fueling the war effort . While most of these were still humorous in tone as well as serious in message , two were notably different : Education For Death , the most grimly serious short produced by a Hollywood studio I've ever seen and this one , Chicken Little , in which the humor is sharply limited and the ending is most un-Disney in nature . Disney has been taken to task ( often with justification ) for taking fables , fairy tales and other old source material and making it far more sweet than it originally was . This was not done here-oh , boy , was that not done ! Though there is no overt attempt to make this directly about Germany , the Nazis or Hitler , the context of the times makes it clear who the target is . The use of Hitler's concept of the " Big Lie " is a dead giveaway . Interestingly , the lack of obvious ties to the current enemy make this short less dated and it can readily be viewed as targeting any totalitarian state . There's nothing cute here and only a few laughs . The ending is a punch in the solar plexus . Look at what the fox does with the wishbones . This is available on the Disney Treasures On The Front Lines . The set as a whole is remarkable and is worth having for any number of items it contains . It is telling that , as good as this short is , there are easily a half-dozen other things on the set that are even better . Most highly recommended . Get it while you can .
The second of two run-ins with the same construction worker and good prevails again .	This is the second time this rather arrogant and somewhat dense construction worker tries to best Bugs Bunny . Will they never learn that it's a fools ' errand to try ? Still , if they never tried , there wouldn't be these hilarious shorts to enjoy , if you can see them before the editors get to them in the mistaken belief that children aren't smart enough to distinguish cartoon from reality . Excellent in all respects and well worth seeking out . Most recommended .
One of several cartoons using the need for quiet as a springboard for typical Avery bedlam	More than once , Tex Avery used the idea that it was in someone's best interests to maintain quiet and someone else wanted the opposite . Here we have a bear with an almost pathological hatred of noise ( except his own ) . Efforts to maintain quiet result in sight gags galore of the usual variety in an Avery cartoon and are very funny . The bear steals the cartoon . Most recommended .
Excellent animation and story go hand in hand here	Caroline Leaf has done some exceptional work and this is one of her best . An adaptation of a fable , this is an example of what animation can do . Enjoyable for children and adults alike . This is available through the National Film Board of Canada and is well worth the effort to track down . Most recommended .
Excellent short featuring Betty Boop in living color !	This is an absolutely beautiful cartoon ! Most Fleischer shorts were quite visually striking , to be sure , but Betty Boop only had one color cartoon-this one . While in many ways it's good that black and white was used for most of her cartoons , the sweep of this cartoon cried out for color . The Fleischers were likely also hoping that Betty's popularity would boost interest in the Color Classics series that they were starting . Betty as Cinderella was certainly fitting-after all , Cinderella did ultimately become a princess when she married the prince and Betty Boop is cartoon royalty . Wonderful effort from the brothers Max and Dave . In print and available . Most highly recommended .
This is the first of the Wile E / Road Runner shorts	This short marks the first appearance by either Wile E . Coyote or The Road Runner on-screen . Wile E . is really the star here and a more interesting character , to be sure , but their relationship is really a symbiotic one . Without each other , neither would have had success in films . This short more or less sets the tone for the series : lots of sight gags and a probable increase in Wile E . insurance premiums , while his insurance agent lives on antacids and his agent checks on his remaining hit points with each accident . Most certainly a gem and worth watching . Recommended .
Tex Avery at his best , but this one you'll need to look for to find	This is one of Avery's last with Warner Brothers and he was in fine form , truly magnificent here . But because the hunter is black ( to be fair , there are stereotypes as well ) , the only way you'll find this is on a public domain tape . Despite the fact that Bugs does many of the same tricks on Elmer as he pulls here , this one is frowned on . Public domain tapes vary widely in quality , so buyer beware . there are one or two good quality tapes that I know of , so be prepared to look for this one . It's worth the trouble . Most highly recommended .
A tribute to the human spirit and its resiliency	This short , nominated for an Academy Award , was made by George Pal and concerns an invasion by mechanized war machines in a place obviously modeled on Holland , which was under occupation by the Nazis at the time . It is a tribute to the ability of humanity to persevere against the worst imaginable events and no only survive , but thrive . It is incorporated into The Puppetoon Movie and is a wonderful piece of work . The ending is glorious ! Most highly recommended .
One of the best shorts " done by a Smith named Pete "	Pete Smith was a master of the short films once known as " one-reel " and " two-reel " subjects . Although the bulk of his wrk was humorous in subject and / or tone , he did do more serious work . His best work was very funny , although some of the humor is dated . This is one of the best shorts he did . These were referred to as " A Pete Smith Specialty " and on the title card , it said that this " was done by a Smith named Pete " . The visuals are still quite effective 65 + years later . Turner Classic Movies runs this and a great many other " Pete Smith Specialty " shorts in between movies . This one is highly recommended .
" Hello , Sam . . . Hello , Ralph . "	Chuck Jones , after Tex Avery , was the second-greatest director of animated shorts , perhaps of all time and certainly of their theatrical heyday . Jones was absolutely the best at character development and Sam and Ralph are two of his lesser-known gems . They appeared in all of seven shorts as a team and the shorts work exceptionally well . I think the reason they work so well is the basic premise : that what these two do is a job ! The shorts are absolutely beautiful and the ending to this one is a scream ! Well worth seeing . Recommended .
This should have won the Oscar in 1936 !	This is te cartoon that should have won instead of Country Cousin . Visually well-done and much more entertaining and memorable . Worth watching just for the music alone ! Although there are elements that undoubtably will bruise the sensibilities of some these days , the cartoon has to be given a bit of perspective . It's over sixty years old and it is , after all , just a cartoon . I'm disabled and if I were as hyper-sensitive as the folks who look at things like this cartoon and take umbrage , I would have long since curled up in a fetal position and faded away . Sometimes you need to lighten up , put your head back and float ! Caricatures of celebrities in cartoons were common in the 1930s and 1940s and were almost never terribly flattering . Bing Crosby reportedly hated it when he was used on more than one occasion . SIGH
When Disney was in flower !	This short is an example of The Mouse at their best ! There was a time when Disney was , without a doubt , the best there was . 1937 was a good year for Uncle Walt and his studio . With Snow White and the Seven Dwarves and shorts like this one , it was a banner year . This is a quintessential example of Silly Symphonies-a near seamless blend of music to animation . Good to see it in-print . Well worth getting . Most highly recommended .
The Little Yellow ( Mustard , of course ) Book of Quotations From Chairman Wimpy has its major quote front and center here .	Make no mistake-although officially Popeye's cartoon , one J . Wellington Wimpy is the star here . Wimpy is ( or should be ) the icon for the American approach to consumerism - " I'd gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today . " Wimpy never worries about that far off Tuesday , when his hamburgers will come home to roost ( no doubt with indigestion not far behind ) , he just wants his hamburger today and hang Tuesday . Wimpy reminds me a lot of W . C . Fields ' persona-he too was always concerned with current results , regardless of future consequences . Both also have just a touch of larceny in their heart . Wimpy is my favorite character in the series and his appearances were always too brief and too rare for my taste . Much better sidekick than the rather annoying Shorty ever was or could be . Here's to you , Wimpy , wherever you are . May all your days be Wednesdays . Well worth seeking out . Most Recommended .
A very aptly titled short and one of the best the studio made	This cartoon is the definition of surreal and a example of why the Fleischers were the primary rivals Disney had in the early 1930s , before Warner Brothers and MGM stepped up their quality , while Fleischer started to do a slow fade in the late 1930s . A combination of the Hays Office and friction between the brothers and with the Paramount STudio were partly responsible , as was burnout , I suspect . But this is the glory that was Fleischer's and glorious to behold . Highly recommended .
A rare serious short from the Pete Smith Specialty series	Pete Smith did a series of shorts that were primarily comic in nature and rarely were they ever too serious in nature . This excellent short , nominated for an Academy Award , is a rare exception . The subject is Ben Helwig , a man blinded by accident as a child who learned to work with lathes and other equipment by touch and was ultimately hired for work in a defense plant in WWII . This short was made to encourage the hiring of the disabled as an answer to wartime labor shortages . You see Helwig actually at work with machinery of various types . Quite fascinating . Turner Classic Movies runs this between films and generally runs it during March as part of its " 31 Days of Oscar " event . Most highly recommended .
Tex Avery at the top of his form !	This cartoon is just great ! Lots of sight gags , a fair number of topical gags framed on the war and life on the home front and the most entetaining fairy godmother to come down the pike in quite a while . Another " fairytale " cartoon by Avery that is ribald and lecherous and pokes fun at everything , including itself . Tex Avery was incredible . The bit with the jeep is beautiful ! The swimmers make the final turn , they're coming to the wall-it's a world record ! Recommended !
So help me , I don't know why , but I enjoy this carton ! ! !	Normally , I am not overly fond of terminally cute cartoons or country music . This cartoon is guilty on both counts . With all that going on , I should really run screaming from this one , but I don't . Maybe it's just sufficiently bizarre below the surface to be good , or maybe I'm getting sentimental in my dotage . No matter-the animation is top-notch and it's a well-done short , for all it's cuteness . From behind the net , he takes the puck and fires it past the goalie and he scores to win the Cup ! ! ! Recommended .
An excellent combination of live-action footage and animation that holds up very well	This documentary was nominated for an Oscar and it's easy to see why . Even 45 years later , it is quite an impressive piece of work . Why it isn't in-print is a mystery that only Disney can explain . Good use of live footage and animation in tandem . This used to run as part of " Vault Disney " every few months or so , but I haven't seen it listed in quite a while . sigh Most recommended .
Funny , but it helps if you know who Jerry Collona was .	This cartoon ( deservedly nominated for an Oscar ) features a parody of the great Jerry Collona , a radio and motion picture comedian . The title is a play on one of his signature bits ( " Greetings , gate ! Let's osculate ! ) that were his trademarks . Collona was parodied several times by the guys at Termite Terrace and was popular at the time . Little-remembered today , he really was very funny and is humorously well-done here . This cartoon should really be in-print , as it's fabulous ! With worms lke this , fish don't have a chance ! But I have just one question : where's Yehoodi ? Recommended .
Marvelous , quite mad and twisted ! More , please !	Although I shudder to think what this says about me , I love this short ! In my own defense , let me also state that I loved The Man Who Planted Trees ( what that apparent dichotomy says , who knows ? Who cares ? ) and I'm a prince of a fellow currently in frog mode . But I digress . A poor rabbit finds himself trapped in a situation that would reduce Franz Kafka to one gigantic twitch and takes the viewer down a rabbit hole that would send Lewis Carroll out of the room , screaming incoherently as he ran . Why this didn't get nominated for an Oscar ( even a student nomination ) I'll never understand . A must for any fan of films , particularly the demented ones ( the films , I mean , not the fans ) and well worth tracking down . I found it on a Spike and Mike's Festival of Animation and I believe it's to be released ( tentatively , anyway ) sometime next year by the animator as part of a compilation of all his animated shorts . Most highly recommended !
Excellent combining of live-action and animation	This cartoon effectively combines live-action footage with animation in a very funny but also thoughtful short . It explores desires and dissatisfaction on two very different sides of an atypical fence as an ambitious " toon " has a job interview with a bored and vaguely unhappy " human " and concludes with an entertaining resolution to the interview . Most enjoyable and memorable . Highly recommended . NFB of C did it again !
