more tedious than the first one , and that's saying something	somehow , i managed to get through all 84 minutes of airplane 2 . however , i found it more tedious than airplane 1 , which i thought was impossible . i think i cracked a smile once during the first one , but not even close in this one . the jokes were even more stale and unfunny . i'm sure there are people who have enjoyed and will enjoy this movie , but i am not one of those people . interestingly , ken finkleman wrote and directed this movie and would years later go on to create and write the very funny show the newsroom . but i digress . after watching airplane 2 , i decided i have to do something fun and entertaining . so ' i'voe booked myself into a four day insurance seminar . maybe i'll get more laughs out of it . unless you're a hardcore fan you should avoid this movie . out of 10
help ! ! ! i've just lost 93 minutes of my life ! ! !	what a drag this movie was . it is bad even by most horror movie standards . i kept waiting for something scary to happen . when the end credits finally rolled , realized i was not going to get my wish . there'e nothing scary about this movie , except for the acting and the dialogue and the script . in that case it was truly terrifying . this is your standard cookie cutter horror movie , except not as good . the guy playing the villain is not at all convincing . the characters are just as stupid as in most horror movies , so after a while you wait for them to be killed , just to get it over with . the plot is not logical , and there is at least one glaring technical problem with the movie , which is the following : there is a scene between a female student and her professor in bed at night . the power goes out and plunges the room into darkness . the prof goes downstairs to check it out . in the next scene we see the girl in bed as bright as day . so , what happened to the power outage ? i admit , i had my eyes shut for this movie alright , because i found it hard to keep awake . this movie is a really stinker and wasn't even bad in a good way , it was just plain bad . even the brief scene of nudity can't excuse this mess . oh yeah , tom hanks makes a very small appearance in his movie debut , as elliot , a psyche student . good thing it was a small role , or this thing could have torpedoed his career before it got started . this one gets a well deseved out of 10 yuuck
one of the worst movies ever made	this turd is so bad i wasn't sure i should review it . but , if it keeps one person from seeing it , i'll be happy . i got through 37 minutes and just couldn't take any more . i don't know who comes up with this stuff . are they out on the streets among the rest of us ? i hope not . anyway , this is billed as a vampire movie . there is also a couple of lesbians , a dysfunctional family , some gang violence , and some really disgusting scenes involving the vampires feeding . but this mess is not coherent at all , the acting ( and i shudder to call it that ) was beyond atrocious . the dialogue , again beyond words in its horribleness . If you have 5 dollars and a half dozen or so friends , congratulations you've just made a better movie . a very weak
atrocious	boy , what a letdown this movie was . compared to the animated series , this doesn't even rate . it's all of the place , in terms of tone and story . the acting is pretty bad from all concerned . i felt embarrassed for everybody involved . i found the story lacking in any real excitement . plus , for this character , there should have been a much more compelling characterization . i know it's an origin story , but i think they could have done a lot more with it . it doesn't make much sense , and i couldn't give a lick about any of the characters . the whole thing is really just nonsense . it's 94 minutes i'll never get back . for me , Spawn is a a dismal
An awful sequel to the original	This movie is about the " predator " again . but this time he is in modern day Los Angelles , where a string of bodies have been discovered . and this time the " Predator can blend into his surroundings again , which just happen to be sky scrapers . gimme a break . first off , this dud does not have Arnie . second it looks like it was made for 5 dollars . the premise is kind of dumb . " Predator " in the jungle i could see , but in Los Angelles . come on . anyway , this is not a worthy sequel to the original . i could not watch it all , because it was so lame . the acting wasn't very good , and there are some good actors here . i think this could have been good movie , if they had spent some money , and thought of a better idea for the story . as it is , this was junk .
please shoot me ! i've lost the will to live	so , in the less than 30 minutes i could stomach of this puke before losing my lunch , i saw more nudity than in most pornos , not to mention worse acting . supposedly the plot is that many van drivers on the highway assist the big rig truckers in avoiding the highway police by creating blockades , or distracting the police ( usually , with a big pair of well placed boobs , for the male cops , anyway ) now , i'm all for showing naked women with big boobs , but when every scene is simply an excuse for a woman to get naked , it just gets stupid . i can imagine the ( so called ) director setting up the scene : " Okay ladies , listen up , this is very complicated , but important so pay attention-take off your clothes ! please don't make me go through it all again " . like i alluded to earlier , the acting was lower quality than any porn movie . for the male parts , i imagine they went through a rigorous selection process before they found the right guys . I think it went something like this : they randomly picked a guy off the street and said " hey , dude , you wanna be in a movie ? , there just might possibly be some naked breasts involved " . man , i bet they had to weed out a lot of hopefuls . as for finding the women , it would have been a similar process something along the lines of : " hey baby , make ya a star " . boy , how rigorous and exhausting that must have been for the film ( and i use that very loosely ) makers . now this is billed as a comedy , and it is indeed a comedy ( for all the wrong reasons ) but you may not know that it is also a horror movie-the horror being that it ever saw the light of day . i actually lost the will to live for awhile after seeing this . truly beyond putrid .
made the first one look like a masterpiece ( and that ain't a good thing )	my sister and i had all four movies in the " House " series and decided to have a " House " marathon . we had just watched the first one , and had somehow made it to the end . but it wasn't easy . it was not a good film , at all . so , we suffered through the second one in . we managed to make it through 40 minutes of this dog , before we finally had to put it to sleep . this movie made the first one seem like Shakespeare in comparison . the acting was atrocious , at best . the budget was next to nothing as was the first one . the whole plot was ludicrous , which is to be expected , but not to this degree . nobody would behave like these characters did , given the same situations . a low 2
this is a comedy ( if only it were funny )	in this Movie Dana Carvey hides his face behind many disguises . unfortunately someone also hid all the laughs , somewhere no one will likely find them . this is billed as a comedy , which is OK , but it's not funny . it's not even amusing . it is however , stupid in all the bad ways possible there are some talented actors in this movie , but i guess sometimes actors sign without reading the script , ( or what passes for one , in this case ) Dana Carvey certainly has some comedic talent , but aside from the two " Wayne's World " films , he hasn't has a chance to showcase it . i kinda felt sorry for all involved . it was truly embarrassing and painful to watch . i'd have to give " Master Of Disguise "
. . . and i am merely confused	why ? well , i'm glad you asked . the reason is quite simple . this movie seems to have gotten rave reviews , and it has a high rating ( ) on this site . this really astounds me , since we are talking about a movie that has no real story , is dragged out and boring , and has underwhelming looking CG creatures . this movie is just over 90 minutes , but it sure felt a lot longer . my friend told me i fell asleep for about 10 minutes , but i did not miss anything , as he also said the movie was boring and nothing had happened in those 10 minutes . nothing really happens of any consequence here in 90 minutes either . i felt for poor Will Smith , having to carry a movie about nothing . he does his best , but when you have nothing to work with , it's an uphill and futile battle . for me , this is the most overrated movie i have seen since Pirates 1 . anyway , i give I am Legend a
does not come close to the quality of the TV show	this animated Inspector Gadget movie is pretty lame . the story is very weak , and there is little action . most of the characters are given little to nothing to do . the movie is mildly entertaining at best , but really doesn't go any where and is pointless . it's watchable but only just and is nowhere near the calibre of the animated TV show from the 80's . it's not a movie that bears repeat viewing , at least in my mind . it's only about 74 minutes long including credits , so i guess that's a good thing . unlike in the TV show , the characters are not worth rooting for here . in the show , you wanted Inspector Gadget to save the day , but there , who really cares ? anyway , that's just my opinion . for me Inspector Gadget's Last Case is a disappointing
inferior clone of the original	this followup to the original Wildthings falls short in a lot of ares . it is nearly a carbon copy of the original plot structure . basically people betraying each other and being betrayed by others . however , there is no originality in this movie . the basic story has been done and much effectively in the original . there are a lot of twists and turns in this one , but they are very predictable , although ridiculous at time . the acting , while decent in the original , is less than decent in this movie . this is unfortunate , because the story itself is not good enough to carry the movie . you may find your eyelids drooping while watching this thing , as it is painfully slow at times . and you're eyes will glaze over and roll back in your head at the absurdity of the plot twists . i believe many of these plot twists were simply added to keep the movie at a certain running time . this movie is a much less than average effort out of 10
I " Envy " anyone who hasn't had the misfortune	oh , my , this is just not good . this may have the designation of a comedy , but it's not funny . it is however boring and lame . Ben Stiller and Jack Black are in this one , so there should be some potential for laughs , but somewhere between the green lighting of the picture and the actual filming , things fell apart . just because something looks like it might be funny on the page , doesn't mean the movie will actually be funny . for me , the jokes all fall flatter than a pancake . i did watch this all the way through , in case it became funny , or at least amusing . even watchable would have been better than nothing . oh , well , such is life . at least i can warn others about it . assuming anyone reads this comment . after that , i absolve myself of any responsibility . since i'm in a generous mood , seems fair for " Envy "
not good	hmmm , what to say about this movie . very , very low budget . CGI that looks very shiny and nice , but completely fake . for most of the movie , nothing happens , except a lot of talking . when the shark finally makes an appearance , it is underwhelming . it does not look that menacing . there is zero tension in the movie . there are only 2 good things in this movie . one is that the acting , surprisingly , is not that bad . and 2 , there are some deep underwater scenes showing some very unique and beautiful creatures . they are very obviously CGI , but they look very pretty , nonetheless . i sat trough the whole movie to see the shark . i wish i hadn't . 60 minutes of boredom for a few minutes of shark footage is not worth it . it's obvious they had zero budget , so they shouldn't have attempted this type of movie . i'll give it
instead of dumb teens as victims , we have dumb adults who should know better	for a slasher / horror movie , this one has very little graphic gore , compared to many of the genre . this kinda surprised me while watching it . but then i read a user comment saying that the censors really butchered this one , forcing the filmmaker to leave out a lot of gore . anyway . . . one thing which really stood out for me about this movie is the acting . well , the lack of , actually . i haven't seen acting this bad since the last time i saw acting this bad . the other thing of note is the stupid characters . many slasher flicks have dumb , oversexed , drunk or stoned teenagers as the victims . that's bad enough . but here we have dumb , oversexed , drunk or stoned adults as the victims . truly pathetic . you can kinda expect it from teens , but adults should just know better . the only good thing about this movie is towards the end , which holds a surprise i wasn't expecting . i won't give it away , so unfortunately for you ( or not , depending on your tastes in movies ) you'll have to watch the movie . i doubt this will be the worst movie you'll ever see , but for me , it just isn't very good . For me , " My Bloody Valentine " is a
faster pace , more action than the first , still not that great	i guess this movie is better than the first Resident Evil . there is more action and a bit of humour , which is sorely lacking in the first one . and i like the characters more in this one . i think it was a better mix of personalities . what i didn't like is the story . this one is more about the action and there is quite a bit more than the first one . you know , people getting shot and dying , lots of stuff blowing up , that sort of thing . sometimes the movie borders on the ridiculous with some of the stunts they do . plus there is some totally gratuitous nudity that does nothing to movie the story . don't get me wrong , i like nudity as much as the next guy , but it should have some point . anyway , if you're an action junkie , you might like this movie . other than that , there's not much here . having said that , i do you like it better than the first movie , because it is not mind numbingly boring , as the first one was .
bah , humbug	this is another adaptation of A Christmas Carol , this one starring Albert Finny as Ebeneezer Scrooge . the only other version i have seen so far is the 1951 version starring Alistair Sim . there is no comparison between the two . i loved the 1951 version , and thought Sim was very natural in the part and inhabited the character without effort . in this one , Finny's portrayal is over the top , as is the character itself . plus , there's lots of filler in this adaptation . there's a lot of musical numbers , which just annoyed me . i actually don't mind some musicals , when i am expecting them . but i wasn't expecting this to be musical . the movie even descends into farce , at one point , in my opinion . to top it all off , it's very slow and ponderous . this is all just my opinion , and others may like it . if you like musicals , and you're in the mood for one , you might like this version of a Christmas Carol . for me , i it was all i could do to quit watching before the end .
very bleak	this is an ' inspired by true events ' movie . it's a bleak movie , to be blunt about it . it's about a woman who had done nothing but lie cheat and steal her whole life . as a result her and her young daughter live a life on the run from the law . i found this movie slow and boring for the most part . it doesn't have a happy ending , ( at least to me it doesn't ) like some movies of this genre have . and it doesn't resolve anything or tie up any loose ends , like i hoped it would . i only kept watching for two reasons . one was the hope that there might be a happy ending . tow was that the acting was pretty decent . so , basically the movie is only worth watching for the performances . as a result , my vote for Lies My Mother Told Me is a
not that good	this is a B movie , no doubt about it . that isn't always a bad thing . i f you have good acting , decent characters , and a decent storyline , it could work . does this movie have any of that ? maybe a little . the story is mildly interesting . none of the characters are , except for one . that would be the villain , played by Richard Lynch . Lynch has a certain quality about him that makes him watchable . the rest of the characters , i didn't really care one way or another . the reason for that is the suspect acting . the other thing i didn't like ( in fact , it really annoyed me ) was the unbelievably cheesy . sound effects / music that was used every time somebody was being scanned . it drove me up the wall . while this is nowhere near the worst movie i have seen , it is closer to the bottom than the top .
good for the kids , but has some scary looking characters	i don't quite no what to make of this film . this is Garfield's first CG animated movie . i thought it had some amusing moments , but nothing laugh out loud funny . the story is very simple , so kids will be able to follow it very easily . the voices were very fitting for the characters . the CG in general looks nice and pretty . that's the good news . the bad news ? some of the characters look quite freaky , almost scary , i think . . i also found the movie very slow for much of the time . i realise i'm much older than the target audience . for kids , if they don't find some of the characters too creepy , they will probably enjoy it . adults might like it too , and if not , at least they know their kids are watching kid friendly entertainment . for me , i give Garfield Gets Real a
it was OK	this film is inspired by 1933's The Mystery of The House of Wax . many scenes are identical and some of the dialogue is verbatim , but this version is much more fleshed out , both story wise , and character wise . it's also on a grander scale . however , for me , most of the characters were not that interesting , and there were no real standout performances as there were in original version . there was more excitement and suspense in this one , though . unfortunately in my mind , there are a few scenes of filler , or at least what seems like filler to me . one unfortunate aspect of this version is that it was filmed in 3D , but the DVD version is not , so in some scenes , it's clear they existed for the 3D value , but have little point here . i didn't find it scary , but it certainly was macabre and morbid . all in all , not a bad movie , but not quite as good as its inspiration .
a real mishmash	a friend of mine had told me this movie was horrible . but , i decided to give it a try any way . it starts off pretty awful , then slowly gets watchable . but then it turns not so good again . not as awful as it was at the beginning , but not really very good either . the problem i found with the movie is that a lot of the time , it's muddled and close to incoherent . and when i could follow it , it wasn't really anything spectacular . plus there are a lot of things that don't make sense . the concept of light versus darkness is not really original , but this movie tweaks the concept slightly , putting its own little spin on it . unfortunately , it's not enough to elevate the movie . if you're an action buff , you might find this movie boring , as the action is fairly sparse . for me , the movie never quite got exciting enough to be anything more than average . and the ending is even less exciting than the rest of the movie . i don't quite agree with me friend that this movie was awful , it just wasn't really good either . i'd have to give Night Watch a
not as good as i had hoped	this is only the second animated Popeye short i have seen , the first one being With Swee ' Pea , which i thought was pretty good . this one , i didn't like as much . it doesn't stack up too well , in my opinion . there's a lot of action , but i didn't find a lot of it all that funny . Bluto ( Popeye's nemesis ) plays Sinbad as a blow hard ego maniac . he has a few singing numbers , which are very brief , but i found them irritating . this feature is around 15 minutes long , and i found it a bit slow , even boring . With Swee ' Pea was much more lite hearted , and " Sinbad " was much darker than i was expecting . i guess it's really a matter of taste . for me , Popeye the Sailor Meets Sinbad the Sailor is a
creepy music , but no real scares	not bad , i guess . it had some creepy moments , courtesy of some ' Omen ' type music . you know , the chanting in Latin . it wasn't really scary , though . the concept is neat , but not wholly original . there was an original Star Trek episode that may have inspired the idea for the short story . and it also has elements of the 70's movie The Wicker Man . anyway , it's certainly got Stephen King written all over it . it's quite twisted , to say the least . it's not very graphic at all though . in fact , it's quite tame . i thought it could have been a TV movie , actually . i even checked this site to see if it was . the effects are cheesy , but i've seen a lot worse . the acting is OK , for the most part . but the guy who played the cult leader was very convincing . he exuded evil . the acting by the children was adequate , i guess , although one of the girls was very good in her role . i did feel that the guy who played the second in command tended to overact a bit . he was kinda creepy though . there have been countless sequels , and watching this movie doesn't inspire me to run out and watch any of them , though i may watch them in time . for me , Children of the Corn is a
i found the book riveting , the movie - - not so much	after watching this movie , i was a bit disappointed . i mean , the movie was OK , but it doesn't compare to the book , which i found riveting . the movie is set During WWII , and is basically about the British code breakers who were continually trying to break the code of the Enigma machine , which is how the Germans communicated with each other . there is some fine acting here , by Dougray Scott , Kate Winslet , Saffron Burrows and Jeremy Northam , and many others . there a few moments of tension and suspense , but mostly the movie is all about the drama . there is also a love story angle here . this is not some big Hollywood blockbuster version of events . this is a small , independent film . it is based on true events , and i believe it is probably fairly accurate . it's taken from the book by Robert Harris . i highly recommend the book , but if you read it first you , will likely be disappointed in the movie . my vote for Enigma :
the plot is thinner than shaved ham , but the movie is actually quite fun	it took awhile for me to get into this movie . but somewhere along the line , i actually started to enjoy myself . once you get around the wafer thin plot , it's not half bad . the trick with this movie is to not take it too seriously . for instance , as soon as the bad guys show up , you know they're bad long before they reveal their intentions . the only other thing they could have done to telegraph they were bad would have been to have been for them each to have a neon sign over their heads saying villain . it's that absurd . and there's some cringe worthy dialogue . however , the are some very witty one liners mostly courtesy of Sally Field , and their was an interesting , and ( mostly ) likable mix of characters . there were actually even a few exciting moments . of course , there are endless explosions . this movie doesn't hold a candle to the original Poseidon Adventure . it was actually fairly pointless , when you think about . but it was fun , and actually quite entertaining . for me , Beyond the Poseidon adventure is a solid
Bruce Willis and Sam Jackson team up	of the first three Die Hard movies , i liked this , the third one , the least . i think manly because there wasn't very much action , but i also didn't like the story . i just thought there was too much going on . plus , i found the movie too long . it wasn't any longer than the first two movies , but i didn't feel the pacing was very good . plus , this movie doesn't really do a lot to distinguish itself from other movies of the genre . i did like Sam Jackson is his role as a shopkeeper who ends up helping John McClane . i thought he was funny and a good fit for Bruce Willis . i also thought Jeremy Irons was good as the man villain . Graham Greene is good too , in his role as a cop . This movie is missing Bonnie Bedelia , who played McClane's wife in the firs two movies . even though she didn't have that big a role in the other two films , i thought she was great with what she had . anyway , this isn't a bad movie by any means , but it's just not as good as number two , and nowhere near as good as the first one . for me Die Hard : With a Vengeance is a
weakest of the original trilogy	this movie is hands down , the worst of the original 3 . the writing is seriously lacking in this one . the story is weak an not compelling . the protagonist is weaker than the previous 2 , by a mile . this whole movie is anticlimactic . very little happens over the course of the film . Basically , Kreese , from the original movie wants revenge on Daniel and Mr Myagi for events that happened during the beginning of the 2nd movie . there is very little wisdom or philosophy dispensed by Myagi in this 1 . the ending is weak and anti-climatic , to say the least . if you do decide to watch Karate Kid 3 , you should watch the previous 2 first , otherwise you might not quite understand what is happening . it is unfortunate that they had to end the trilogy on such a low note . maybe they just couldn't come up with anything better . in which case , they should't have bothered . The movie is watchable , even entertaining at times , but does not live up to The Karate Kid name .
some entertaining song and dance numbers , but virtually no story	this is pure musical , with virtually no story , but it's actually pretty fun . there are some pretty entertaining songs and dance numbers . some of the songs , though , i felt were a bit overdone . if you're not in to musicals , you might want to skip this one . if you're a musical fan , you might like it . the characters are all very likable , and the movie is all ages appropriate . there's nothing offensive at all . it moves along at a good pace . you might feel satisfied while watching . the only thing is , i don't feel it was that memorable . after it's over you'll probably forget about it pretty quickly . but it is entertaining while watching , so i'll give The Girl Next Door a
has more heart than the original	this remake of the 1961 version is actually a pretty decent movie . i found it engaging and high energy . the characters had some personality and depth to them , especially the mother and father , played By Dennis Quad and Natasha Richardson . as well , the story has some heart , and is very touching . also , this is the film debut of Lindsay Lohan , who was 11 at the time , and steals the show . she plays the twins , and is very engaging , convincing and likable . this version is almost the same as the remake , but the story is a bit expanded , and the movie is a bit more fun . at least i though so . it's a family friendly film , and adults should be entertained as well . my vote for the 1998 version of The Parent Trap :
strong on realism , just a bit too slow at times	i sort of liked this movie . it's about a crack team of government agents who must stop a madman who has hijacked a freight train and holds some of the crew hostage . complicating matters is that there is a nuclear bomb on board . that sounds like many other movies . and it is true , the premise is very familiar . the only difference here is that this movie is much more realistic . there not a lot of death defying stunts which strain believability . also , the characters act more like they would in this kind of situation . the bad guys are smarter than normal , usually a step ahead of the good guys . the good guys are more like real human beings . they make mistakes that you believe could really be made . they're not super human . i thought the cast was good for this movie . you have some really good actors here . Patrick Stewart is the head honcho of the agency , while Pierce Brosnan and Alexandra Paul are the two main agents . Ted Levine is the crazy in this one , along with Christopher Lee . i've always liked Patrick Stewart and Pierce Brosnan . both are very credible in their roles . but Alexandra Paul really impressed me here . i also liked the fact that her character was a strong woman , not a damsel in distress . the supporting cast was also very good . i also think the way they depicted events had some realism . i think the same thing could happen the same way in real life . having said all that , i have to say the movie was pretty slow , not quite too slow to watch , but pretty close . that's really the only complaint i have about the film . otherwise i didn't find too much wrong with it . that one little problem lowers the rating a bit though , from my point of view . for me " death Train " AKA " Detonator " is a
better than the 1990 version	i finally had a chance to see this movie . it is hailed by many as a classic . while i can kind of see how that might be the case , i feel a bit letdown . when this movie came out , it was brutally shocking and innovative , but not so much today . it isn't a poorly made movie . in fact it is quite well made . the fact that it was filmed in black and white did add to the dark atmosphere and creepiness . the music worked well with the film , for the most . however at times it seemed to over power the film . the acting is pretty good . Duane Jones plays the character of Ben , the no nonsense , take charge character in the film . his portrayal is very effective and authentic . the movie also had a documentary fell to it , which elevated it . there are some weak points in the film . one is that the " Zombies " move so slow , and by slow i mean molasses uphill in January " slow " . the other is the apparent cause of the zombie-ism . it just seemed too far-fetched . despite all this , the film does move well and is worth watching , which is more than i can say for the horrible 1990 version . i'd have to say a strong for this one
great musical score	i have no doubt that if i had seen this when it first came out in 1980 , it would have scared the crap out of me . in the present day though , i didn't find it scary , mainly because i have seen so many horror / slasher movies since then . this movie is hardly graphic or shocking at all compare to today's feature film , and even some TV shows , for that matter . however , i will say really enjoyed the musical score by Henry Manfredini , who must have been influenced strongly by Bernard Herman , who scored Psycho . i believe Kevin bacon makes his big screen debut here . the acting for this type of movie is fine , although i have to single out Betsy Palmer for really standing out . this movie spawned , i believe , 10 sequels , all differing in quality . my vote for Friday the 13th is a
not bad , though i found it slow at times	this western tells the story of four men , each a specialist in a different field , hired to rescue a woman kidnapped by a Mexican revolutionary . of course it's not quite as straightforward as that , and things don't quite go the way they should . it stars Lee Marvin , Burt Lancaster , Ralph Bellamy and Jack Palance , among others . i didn't mind the movie , but i thought it would be a bit better than it was . for me , there just wasn't a lot of action , but there was a lot of talking . it sort of reminded me a bit of the Dirty Dozen , though i liked that movie better . still , this movie is entertaining enough , if not fast paced . i think you could do a lot worse with two hours of your time . for me , it rates a
above average crime drama	int his police drama , Frank Sinatra plays a police detective just weeks from retirement , trying to solve a string of murders and stop the murder from killing again . there's another little subplot thrown in that has nothing to do with the rest of the movie , but is merely added to make the film more interesting dramatically , at least , i think that's the reason . Sinatra is very good here , and really the only central character . the rest of the cast are in supporting roles or extended cameos . anyway , the film does work . it's very atmospheric , and the tone is one of almost melancholy , but it works here . my vote for The First deadly Sin is a
great ending ( )	this fourth entry in the series is actually not too bad . i liked it a bit better than the other 3 , mainly because of the ending , which was pretty climactic , unlike many movies . plus , it was better paced . this one features a 12 year old Corey Feldman , but i still liked it . it pretty much follows the familiar formula of the last 3 . minor spoilerit's called the Final Chapter , but if you've followed the series at , you know it isn't . end of spoilerit probably was going to be , but then the filmmakers realized they had a cash cow on their hands , and couldn't pass up the opportunity to keep churning them out . whether that's good or bad is a matter of opinion . in any case , my vote for Friday the 13th : The Final Chapter is a
the weakest of the series ( but still watchable )	i haven't seen the new Rocky movie , Rocky Balboa , so i can't comment on that . but of the first 5 movies , this is the weakest . they should have stopped at 4 . the movie is watchable , it's just not up to par with its prequels . it is definitely smaller scale all around . this is obviously deliberate and it certainly sets a different tone for the film . there are some interesting things in this movie . one is who Rocky fights and why . the other is how and where . mild spoiler ahead . there is also a sub-plot involving Rocky's son . besides these things , however , it just fails to impress . there really wasn't any need for a 5th movie in the Rocky saga , but they made 1 anyway . so , is this movie worth watching ? of course . it is entertaining . just don't expect anything mind blowing .
very deliberately paced , but ultimately worth it	i admit , this is a very deliberately paced movie . just when you decide to turn it off from boredom , the movie drops you a tantalizing clue or two . just enough to keep you watching . this movie is all about the drama and the acting . it is very low key and the acting is good . the movie is a psychological suspense mystery . just when you think you have it figured out , it turns out you don't . i found it hard to know for sure who was crazy and who was sane and what was real and what wasn't . if you can get through it , i think it's worth it in the end . the ending is satisfying , even if it leaves unresolved questions . obviously this movie is not for everyone . if you're an action junkie , you might not be able to sit through this . otherwise , give it a shot
not bad at all , some very funny moments	this movie isn't too bad . there are a couple of very funny moments in the movie . i also liked the energy level of the film . it was very high . the movie is entertaining for the most part . the only things i didn't like , is that thought Steve Martin over exaggerated his expressions and action in some of the physical comedy . i also thought the " inspirational " theme music was a bit overpowering at times . but these are just small complaints . otherwise , it's a pretty good movie . i thought the kids all did a good job acting . really like Bonnie Hunt , who played the wife and mother . i thought she was a standout in the movie . i did think the ending was predictable , but i'm sure that's by design . with most movies of this genre , you usually know how things will end up . after the movie ended , i felt satisfied that i had got my money's worth , which is more than can be said for many movies . i give " Cheaper by the Dozen " a strong
doesn't hold a candle to the John Ford / John Wayne original	this is ( a far as i can tell ) the third version of the classic movie first directed in 1939 by John Ford and starring John Wayne . i haven't seen the second film ( 1966 ) so i can't comment on that one . this 1986 version though , i can comment on . in my mind , it doesn't come near to the original , which is a classic , and one of the best movies i have seen . this version has in many of the starring roles , Country and western singers of the era , including Willie Nelson , Waylon Jennings , Johnny Cash and Kris Kristofferson . also in the cast are John Schneider ( TV's Dukes of Hazard ) , June Carter Cash , Jessi Colter ( wife of Waylon Jennings ) , and Mary Crosby ( TV's Dallas ) the movie was an entertaining diversion , but the acting was underwhelming . The only decent performance of the bunch came from Kristofferson . most of the dialogue wasn't that great , either , including a lot of one or two word conversations . and what was up with Mary Crosby and those lips , which looked like she'd had an allergic reaction to peanuts or shellfish , or something . either way , it looked stupid . the movie was also slow , with not much happening of any consequence , and almost zero character development . when it was over , i was indifferent to it . it's nothing memorable and will probably have faded from my mind in a day or so . still , if you have nothing better to do , it passes about 90 minutes or so . for me Stagecoach ( 1986 ) is a
no better or worse than the second installment ( entertaining enough )	at first , it looked like this movie was going down the crapper and quickly . somehow , though , it turns out not too bad . unlike , number two , which isn't really a sequel , this one is . the main character returns , and learns more lessons . i liked the training montages . to me , they were better than the ones in the second film . at times , i could swear it was Van Damme on screen . Daniel Bernhardt really looks like at times . the plot is quite ridiculous , but the action is better , i think . the fight scenes are better at times . the ending could have been a bit better , as the climax seemed to short . however , overall , this movie is no better or worse than the previous entry , and it's not a complete waste of time . in fact , it's quite entertaining . so i'll give it a
gorier than ever	if you're a gore hound , you will love this movie . i think it it is much gorier than any previous entry in the franchise . in fact , i think this movie makes any of the Friday the 13th movies look like an episode of Mr . Rogers Neighbourhood . this one just about crosses my gore threshold . having said that , i don't feel this movie was as thrilling as the previous ones . id didn't really feel any adrenaline rush . in fact , i thought some parts were slow . i did , however like how they showed that the genesis of both Leatherface and the rest of the family . they didn't spend a lot of time on this aspect , but i think they pretty much covered everything they needed . i also really liked the music . i thought it set a great tone for the movie . whether it's a better movie than The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake of 2001 is a matter of personal taste . for me , Texas Chainsaw Massacre : The Beginning is a
great gory , disgusting fun	if you're looking for good acting and a good plot , this is not the movie for you . but if you like way over the top gore , with a soundtrack containing some great ( and not so great ) 80's hard rock and metal songs , this is your movie . the title might be misleading . the movie is about demons , but i thought they were more like zombies . smarter and faster maybe and with razor sharp claws and fangs , but zombies . the gore factor in this one is off the scale . the movie is entertaining , especially when you see these demons / zombies chasing people around to the the beat of some hard pumping metal tune . the whole thing plays pretty much like one long music video . i just thought it was great gory , disgusting fun . it's not high art , but then what horror movie is . for me , Demons is a
the not-too-distant future	this is certainly a different movie , to say the least . it's the first opera that i know of to contain goth , horror , fantasy and industrial music together and make it into a movie . it's based on a stage play of the same name . i didn't like this movie in the beginning . i found the first half painfully slow . but from that point on it picks up . there is some great art design her as well as some great set pieces . this is a very stylish production , and i liked the bleak vision it paints of the future and the grittiness . plus , it tells a good story . to me , it does echo other movies , like Sin City , and even the Kill Bill movies , in it's look . but maybe that's just me . there are a couple of scenes which may be grotesque to some people , so you should be aware of that going in . almost all of the dialogue is sung , since it is an opera . but isn't you typical opera . it's much more contemporary . for , me the 2nd half was strong enough to overcome the weak 1st half , so i give Repo : The genetic Opera a
better than average as an animated film and an animated comedy	hmmm . once again i'm amazed . i can't understand the low rating ( just over ) this movie has . i thought there were a few very funny moments in the movie , much more than " Over the Hedge " which has a rating of over . this movie is also touching in parts and i thought they achieved a good balance of humour and drama . while i wouldn't say it is hysterically funny , there are , like i said , some very funny moments . this movie is also a fun movie to watch . it is exciting , with plenty of action . this to me is a much better family movie than its rating reflects . id have to say it tries very hard to achieve its goal of being an animated comedy ( and succeeds often enough ) rather than just an animated film . " Barnyard " gets a .
good acting in a paint by numbers action / crime drama movie	( the following review / comment is my own personal opinion ) i found this movie entertaining . it is pretty fast paced and never really lets up . it's basically about an elite group of cops whose sole purpose is to tail the bad guys and learn their routine . then the nab them in the act . this sometimes results in people being victimized so they can have an air tight case against the bad guys . but the squad becomes more of a vigilante group , taking on the role of judge , jury and executioner . the movie is apparently based on a real squad that still exists today . but the events and the characters in the movie are fictional . there is fair amount of violence in this movie and a some pretty crude language . it's a pretty standard paint by numbers action / crime drama , but i think the acting performances elevated it quite a bit . Lou Diamond Phillips and Scott Glenn are the two main actors , but there are some great supporting performances . for me , Extreme Justice is a .
action packed and entertaining	my sister and i watched this sequel to the 1976 version of KIng Kong . and we actually both liked it . sure it's no masterpiece and i didn't like it quite as much as King Kong , but i did find it entertaining and fun . i felt it was on a smaller scope than KIng Kong ( 1976 ) and less serious , on my opinion , but it wasn't half bad . true , the dialogue won't win any awards , and the acting could have been better , but there was plenty of action and excitement . the story is bit of a stretch for sure , but if you don't take it too seriously , you might enjoy it for what it is : an action packed , entertaining 90 minutes or so . and it might make you forget about life for awhile . for me , King Kong Lives is a
typical action movie elevated by great supporting performances	this is a typical action movie . obviously it has lots of action , but there isn't much originality to the story . we've seen this movie before . the only difference is that some details are different and the title isn't the same . otherwise , there's no difference . OK , the actors are different . Harrison Ford plays the American president who becomes the reluctant action hero . he's OK , i suppose , but he seems to play every character he portrays in the same manner . they all sound and look alike to me . i liked Wendy Crewson as the president's wife . i thought she was credible in the part . i was also impressed with Glenn Close in her role as the vice president . but it's Gary Oldman , as the villain , who steals the show , in my mind . when you add everything up , the movie is entertaining , although less so than others of the genre . if it weren't for Wendy Crewson , Glenn Close and especially Gary Oldman , i would give this film a lower rating . as it is , i give " Air Force One " a
not bad , but not as good as the original	in many ways , i thought this movie was not as good as the 1st . yes , it is truer to the animated show in many respects . in fact , id say it is too true to the cartoon . in this case , the cartoon does not translate too well into live action . in the 1st , they veered away from the cartoon quite a bit and that worked for me . in this movie , " Dr Claw " seemed way too over the top and not in a good way . the character sounded more stupid than anything . i think they tried too hard to make him seem evil and instead made him a caricature . the henchmen were dimwitted , just like the cartoon , but that seemed to work in this movie . most of the humour is of the type that young kids would find funny , but most adults probably wouldn't . as for the title character , i found he was was too idiotic ( it worked in the cartoon , but not here ) , at 1st , but after awhile he became somewhat endearing . there are few things a liked about the movie . i liked the fact that Penny had a bigger role to play , and i also liked the fact that Gadget had some competition / decent romantic interest . overall , though , i didn't think this movie measured up to the original . though it had its moments . for me " Inspector Gadget 2 " is a
Eastwood directs and stars	like many of his western character , Eastwood starts in this film as a quiet mysterious loner . he ends up helping people out , and ends up on someones else's ' bad side as a result . his character is known as Preacher in the movie , but he's not you typical preacher , and he's much more than that . Eastwood also directed and produced this film . this isn't an action packed western . it's more drama than anything , but the dialogue is good , as is the acting . John Russel is particularly impressive , who plays a lawman of sorts . even though he has a pretty small role , he has great screen presence and charisma . as far as western go , this one sticks to most of the tried and true conventions , but the characters are interesting . not one of the best westerns ever made , nor one of Eastwood's best as either director or actor . still , it is a decent 115 minutes or so . my vote for Pale Rider :
better than many straight ti video martial arts flicks ( and even some theatrical releases )	i may be in the minority here , but i actually liked this movie . for a straight to video martial arts movie , it isn't all that bad . trust me , i've seen a lot worse movies of this genre , some of which have ( inexplicably ) had a theatrical release . anyway back to this movie . what did i like about it ? i liked the dynamic of the wise ( cracking ) mentor and the younger , cocky student . Dennis Chan plays the mentor Xian , while Sasha Mitchell plays the young hero . there are some funny lines from both and they both play off each other very well . Mitchell is fairly credible as an action hero . i'm not sure if he has any martial arts experience , but if not , then the fight scenes are very well choreographed . there are some great fights in this movie . Chan is also very good in his role as the sidekick . the fact that the movie had some levity is also a positive . also , unlike in many movies of the genre , where the acting is forced or over the top , that isn't the case here the actors know they're not doing Hamlet . the plot may not be original , but the material is handled as well as any other martial art flick . so , at the risk of being hunted down and shot , i give this movie a ( oh , that's right , i can't be hunted down and shot , because no one knows who i am . ( big raspberry )
moves slow , but is worth watching to the end	this little gem is pretty decent made for TV movie . i don't wan to give anything away , but basically there's violent nut bar running around , threatening our main character Susan , played by Nastassja Kinski . if you wanna find out the whos and hows and whys , you have to watch the movie . there a a number of suspects to keep you guessing , although you might figure out who it is fairly quickly . but even if you do , it's still wort the watch . the movie builds atmosphere and suspense very slowly , so if you don't have a lot of patience you might not be able to finish it . however , if you do watch it , i encourage you to watch to the end . i think it's well worth the pay off . for me , Blind Terror is a
woman become victim of cyber identity theft and tries to get her life back	The Net 2 . 0 is an above average movie for its genre . It is basically the story of a woman who has her identity along with her life stolen , as if she never existed . she must then try to get it back . this movie is not a sequel to the original . in fact it has none of the characters from that movie . nevertheless , it is suspenseful , riveting and action packed . there are of course a few plot twists , some predictable , others not . the acting is more than decent , especially from Nikki Deloach ( TV's North Shore ) as Hope Cassidy , the main character . She is very credible as a woman who has lost everything . the supporting cast are also strong . the direction is a bit suspect at times , as the director utilizes many jump shots throughout . A jump shot is essentially a type of camera trick . this is used to make the action flashier for the audience . However , it has been done so much before that audiences are mot impressed . minor quibble aside , however , Net 2 . 0 is overall a well done , entertaining and fun movie . well worth your 90 minutes .
this one has a few chills	i don't agree with the rating ( ) this movie has on this site . i actually thought it deserved a higher rating . it's a pretty eerie and creepy movie . it has a great atmosphere of dread and foreboding . at least i thought so . i always felt like something creepy was about to happen , which it did . but it usually creeped up slowly on you . there were no jump out of your seat moments . this is an old fashioned type chiller . there's no gore , no trick shots , no sudden loud noise to make you jump . this one keeps the creepy atmosphered right to the end . there is lots of suspense in this movie , and some fine acting from Emily Blunt , and Ashton Holmes , who play the the girl and the boy . we are never told their names . this movie is very deliberately paced , so if you're expecting a lot of action , this is probably the wrong movie for you . for me , though , i enjoyed it . my vote for Wind Chill is a
a fun martial arts action flick	Mortal kombat is a fun movie , although dated . there is plenty of action , good fight choreography and the story is unique for its time . the characters are all interesting and the good guys are likable . the one complaint about this movie is that its makeup effects are poorly done In regards to one of the main baddies , a freak of nature named goro . it looks very much like goro is simply a man in a rubber suit , which does not look at all real . the movie is over ten years old , but still , you'd think they could have done a better job . however , surprisingly , this does not take away from the rest of the film . it is a fun diversion for around 90 minutes , and it moves at a good clip . i also like the fact that there is some character development , showing the motivation of the characters . to me , this is an enjoyable film , despite its flaws . out of 10
lots of fast paced fun	this is a pretty good Scooby Doo movie . it's fast paced , with some interesting characters , and the story is interesting . beyond that , the movie is fun to watch . Scooby and the gang are supposed to be vacationing in Paris , but end up in Nepal , battling the abominable snowman , and trying to unravel the mystery as they go . this Scooby Doo movie has a lot more action than many i've seen so far , and it's also quite funny . fans of Scooby and the gang are sure to like it , and even people who have never seen a Scooby Doo adventure should find it entertaining . if you haven't seen it you should check it out . for me , Chill Out Scooby Doo is a
solid espionage movie	i thought this was a well done movie . it moves along at a good clip . it's never boring , and it was much more straight forward than i expected it to be , making it easy to follow . this is a movie that i didn't find overly compelling , but more than enough to maintain interest . there isn't a lot of suspense or tension . we are shown at the beginning how the movie will end up , but it is interesting seeing how it gets to that that point . that's a credit to the good writing . but i think it the acting in this one that really elevates it . Chris Cooper was terrific as usual . but Ryan Phillippe really impressed me here . i thought he was outstanding . Laura Linney was good as well , although i wish she had been given a more substantial role . all things considered , this is a low key movie . it won't blow you socks off or anything , but it works . i would watch this movie again , as i found it interesting . for me , Breach is a solid
fourth movie in the Jack Ryan Series ( second best next to The Hunt for red October )	this fourth movie in the Jack Ryan series , features Ben Affexk as Ryan , who surprisingly does an OK job . but there are two supporting performances that really stand out for me , first is Morgan Freeman , who is amazing in his role . and Liev Schreiber , . both are equally effective . for me , the movie is almost worth it just because of those two performances . the rest of the supporting cast is also very good . i like the story . i found it very relevant and realistic . i also thought way the characters behave in the movie is realistic , as well . the special effects in this movie blew me out of my seat . they were seamless , as far as i can tell . there's also the unpredictable aspect of the movie . and there is a lot of suspense and tension to keep you riveted . by the way , the first movie of the Jack Ryan series is The Hunt for red October with Alec Baldwin as Ryan . the second one is patriot Games , with Harrison Ford as the title character . the third is Clear and Present Danger , also with Ford . but for me , The Sum of all Fears is the second best of the series , next to The Hunt for Red October . the other two , i didn't really care for too much . for me , The Sum of all Fears is a
now , thats more like it	after seeing how disappointing " RoboCop 2 " was , i did not have high hopes for this one . however , i was pleasantly surprised . while i didn't feel it was quite as good as the original , it was pretty close . it had a different kind of storyline than i was expecting . this story was pretty coherent , and had some unpredictability about it , which i liked . it also had some depth to it . there was a good mix of action , drama and humour , and the humour worked here . this movie has some genuinely funny moments . the movie is certainly less violent than the previous 2 , but that doesn't matter here . there's still plenty of explosions and car chases . the special effects in this one were pretty good , in my opinion . this movie is the most fun of the 3 . i believe most of the laughs were intentional , at least they came off that way . the series redeems itself with this installment . for me , " RoboCop 3 " is a strong
great fun	i truly fail to see how this movie has such a low rating ( ) on this site . i mean not only is it funny , but it's action packed , and family friendly . this is one fast paced movie , that doesn't let up . it's a true comedy of errors . the acting is also great in this one Schwarzenegger is in great comedic form here , as is Sinbad . i don't usually find Sinbad funny , but he was in this movie . and Arnie has shown his comedic side in a few movies , but i never expected him to be this funny in a comedy that fires on all cylinders . the only negative thing i would say about this movie is that it strays a bit into sappy territory briefly . there are a few suggestive scenes , but these would be above the heads of most kids , so like i said , this is a family friendly movie . there are some very funny moments throughout , and the movie is always entertaining . for me , Jingle All the way is an
a blockbuster popcorn flick	while this may be an action packed , thrilling movie , it is certainly full of holes and not too improbable , nor is it terribly original . it is fun though and fast paced , and if that's what your looking for , you'll enjoy it . conspiracy theorists will love this , and if you're not a fan of government / military , this will be right up your alley as well . there are plenty of explosions an car chases / accident . Shia LeBeouf and Michelle Monaghan are the main stars . Billy Bob Thornton . Rosario Dawson , Ethan Embry , Michael Chiklis and Anthony Mackie also star . it's basically a blockbuster popcorn movie . as a piece of entertainment , i think it does its job . it's not high art , or anything , but it's not supposed to be . i was quite entertained throughout . for me , Eagle Eye is an
very good western	this is another western i thoroughly enjoyed . i really liked the story and the interesting mix of characters . this was Kevin Costner's first big role , and he certainly has fun with his character . Kevin Kline though is really a standout here . but there are also some other great actors involved . Brian Dennehy is good , as is Scott Glenn , and Danny Glover . I also really liked Linda Hunt as Stella . but again , there is one actor who i felt just didn't fit in this movie . that was Jeff Goldblume . he just seemed out of place to me . the movie itself is well paced , and has a very rousing score , which is perfect for this film . so far though , there are two westerns which are my favourite up to this point . both Open Range , also with Kostner ( and Robert Duvall ) and The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford . however , Silverado is still an immensely entertaining film . for me , it's a strong
solid " voices from the grave " thriller	once again , we have a movie with an inexplicably low rating . it's a movie about the afterlife , and one way the dead may contact the living . whether you believe in the science of it or not , isn't really the point . after all , it's not a documentary . it's a psychological suspense thriller . and in my mind , it succeeds as such . it is genuinely eerie and creepy , and i don't mind saying , the hair on my neck stood up more than once . the performances are good , at least i thought so and the movie is as good as any of the genre so far . is undeserved , in my mind . i'ts not perfect by any means , but not too many movies are . i'd give " White Noise " an
danger , excitement and fun , for both adults and kids	i really enjoyed this movie . it's similar to James Bond , except the spy is a 14 year old kid . there's even a bunch of gadgets , just like In Bond , and there's a version of Q , the guy in charge of the gadgets . this movie has a pretty serious bent , overall , but it also has it's campy , over the top moments . there's plenty of action , intrigue and suspense . and of course , it is also funny at times . the acting is also top topnotch , in my mind anyway . kids and adults will equally enjoy this movie , though it's probably not appropriate for young kids , due to a few dark themes . the ending sets up nicely for a sequel , which was probably planned , but the movie did not do so great at the box office . If you liked Agent Cody Banks , which was similar , but more of comedy , you might want to give this one a try . my vote for Alex Rider : Stormbreaker is a
high intensity fun	i fail to see why this movie has such a low rating on this site ( ) . and i also seem to remember critics blasting it . again , i fail to see why . for me , Fair game is an intense , exciting chase movie . so what if it's generic and not that original . to me , it's more about what you do with the material . in this case , the filmmakers made an entertaining movie . it even had some funny one liners . and the stakes in this movie are a bit higher . the bad guys are not your typical bad guys . they're smart and deadly and have no problem killing people . William Baldwin plays Max , a cop who must protect Kate , ( Cindy Crawford ) a high powered attorney who has angered the wrong people . from this point , the movie is basically a high intensity chase down to the wire . William Baldwin does a good job , but that's not surprising . Cindy Crawford , not having acted before , did a fine job as well . she was i think the brunt of the criticism of this movie , and undeservedly . there are many actresses out there who are much worse than she is in this film . unfortunately her acting career ended before it began thanks to unfair critics and movie goers . if i were a filmmaker , i would cast her in a film , but then i saw potential where almost nobody else does . but that just shows how shortsighted people are . for me , Fair Game is easily an
the good side vs the dark side	so far , this is the only version of this movie i have seen . it's a silent film starring John Barrymore in the dual roles of Dr . Jekyll and Mr . Hyde . the movie does start off slow but picks up quite quickly . once it gets going it is very compelling and engrossing . Barrymore is amazing and pulls of both roles very convincingly . the makeup is amazing , and some of the transformation scenes are very good . the movie is very dark for that time period . it takes the age old struggle between the good side and the dark side and elevates to its extreme . the musical accompaniment is very good and really adds to the tension , and to the the darkness of the film . overall , i liked it and would recommend it .
lots of fun	this is quite an entertaining movie . it has lots of elements that work , including action , excitement , danger , fun , and even some comedy . combine that with an intelligent script and good acting , and you have all the ingredients needed for a successful movie . the chemistry between the actors , especially , but not limited to , Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward is one reason this movie works . Bacon and Ward provide much of the laughs . Having Micheal Gross and Reba MaCyntire along for the ride is a masterstroke , as well . the sense of urgency and danger also help . really , there's a lot to like about this picture . for me , Tremors is a strong
i thought it was a good western	i liked this western Starring Randolph Scoot and Glenn Ford . it's got pretty much everything a western should have . there's gunfights , action , chases on horseback . there's a bit of a romance angle that's hinted at . there's some nice comic relief in the form of Edgar Buchanan , who plays Uncle Willie McLeod , a character who pretend to be a doddering old fool , but is actually aware of everything going on . Randolph Scott plays the town Sheriff , and Glenn Ford Plays Cheyenne Rogers / Bill Smith , a hunted outlaw who eventually tries to change his ways . i liked the different mix of characters in the movie . i didn't find it always fast paced , but i never found it boring either . even though the movie is in 1943 , it is in colour .
terrific little murder mystery	it may be an old movie , but i liked it . it's a very interesting , well acted murder mystery . the dialogue was quite good , the writing was good and the music adds a real atmosphere of creepiness to the proceedings . there's ' not a lot of action . it's more of a psychological character study . and for me , unt9il near the very end , i wasn't sure who the murderer was . Lon Chaney Jr . is the main star . he plays a neurologist / hypnotist who ends up being accused of his wife's murder . the thing about it is , he can't remember the last couple of days , including the day his wife was killed . at least that's what he says . this is part of the Universal Pictures Inner Sanctum Mysteries movie collection . basically , an anthology series along the lines of Twilight Zone and The Outer Limits . anyway , i thoroughly enjoyed this movie , and if you are a Lon Chaney Jr . fan , you might want to check out not only this movie , but the box set collection ( five other movies ) all starring Chaney . i give Calling Dr . Death a solid
think mean girls with an edge ( and multiply that to the nth degree )	i liked this movie . i found it entertaining , creepy and amusing , for all the right reasons . the cast was perfect for this movie . the four main actresses seemed so natural together and really worked well off each other . it's fairly obvious this movie inspired others as well as some TV shows , one in particular . i loved the soundtrack . it just seemed so fitting not just for the movie but for the subject material . i think they the subject matter well , without making it ridiculous and campy . plus , the movie has many relevant issues for that age group ( teenagers in high school ) as well as society in general . it also has a great moral lesson , which i won't give away , but is probably fairly obvious . overall , the movie is a fun and thrilling 90 plus minutes . " The Craft " is easily an from me .
very good morality tale	i liked this movie . it's a movie about football , but it's much more than that . it's really about honor , truth , and loyalty . it is set in 1950 , and chronicles the " Army " - the West Point football team . West point is the very esteemed military academy . as the movie begins , " army is coming off of 27 consecutive wins and hope to win the championship once again . along the way , many on the team will go through some trials that will test their morality and pledge to uphold the principle of honor at any cost . the backdrop to the story is the Korean War . i like the fact the the story has some depth to it . the very fine performances go along way in anchoring the story . Scott Glenn gives a nice understated , quietly intense performance as one of of the coaches . even though this is a morality tale , it doesn't hit you over the head , or preach to you . all in all a pretty good movie . for me " Code Breakers " is an
clever little gem combining the horrors of with with the horror genre	there aren't a lot of movies set during World War I ( that i know of , though i could be wrong ) and there are probably even fewer combining that subject with the horror genre . but it really works , for this movie . combining the the horror of war with a different type of horror is quite clever . the movie certainly has the atmosphere of dread and doom down . it's not overly gory , but there are a few grisly moments , and some very disturbing images . you never really know what's going on , or what might happen next . i really like the fact that there was actually some intelligent thought process involved in the making of this movie . it wasn't just random , slice and dice gore fest . finally , i thought the acting was outstanding . overall , i found the whole experience quite satisfying . for me , Deathwatch gets a strong
a creepy ghost story based ( maybe ) on true events	An American Haunting is a very well made film . it boasts solid acting , good dialogue and is well paced . it also has some good special effects . there is also a very haunting musical score which elevates this movie . beyond that though this is a creepy film . there is one sequence in particular which made my blood run cold . overall , though , i wouldn't call it terrifying , but it make you uneasy . the movie presents a twist toward the latter half which carries over into the final scene . An American Haunting has the tag-line based on true events , and again what that means is anyone's guess . if you want a film that will give you the creeps , check this one out .
what happens when the luckiest woman and the unluckiest man kiss ?	this is a funny movie , very funny at times . it's about a woman ( Lindsay Lohan ) who has everything . perfect job , perfect apt , perfect life , or so it seems . Ashley ( Lohan ) i s gifted with good luck . everything seems to go her way . then , after kissing Jake ( Chris Pine ) , someone she meets at a masquerade party , her luck changes . . . for the worse . it just so happens that Jake had been cursed with the worst luck in the world . everything bad that could happen to him , did . the kiss has transferred all of Ashley's good luck to Jake and , and Jake's bad luck to Ashley . what follows is a very funny movie . the ending is predictable . actually most of the movie is predictable , but it's funny enough that it doesn't matter . i think the basic premise is unique . it's sort of a variation on the body / personality switching genre of movie . i guess you would call it a chick flick / romantics comedy . either way , it works for me . i should also mention the music . i thought it was very fun and infectious . the movie has a " feel good " tone about , but i don't think it overdoes it . i think it's just the right amount . basically , i liked " Just My Luck " quite a bit . i give it a strong
exhilarating action from John Woo	a madman has stolen two nuclear warheads and threatens to detonate them over a populated area if his demand for money is not met . that's the gist of the story . it stars John Travolta , Christian Slater , Samantha Mathis and Delroy Lindo , to name a few . it's a pulse pounding thriller from John Woo ( mission Impossible 2 ) . there's obviously a lot of action , and suspense , and the movie goes right down to the wire . John Travolta is good , as is Christian Slater , but i really liked Samantha Mathis , who i feel is and underrated actress . the action scenes are are exhilarating , though admittedly over the top . but for thrills , you can't beat it . for me , Broken Arrow is an
great harmless fun	i really liked this spoof of Sherlock Holmes , starring Don Knotts and Tim Conway . Knotts is Inpector Winship and Conway is Dr . Tart . Winship is a variation of the Holmes character , but dumber . tart is a variation of Watson , but also dumber . the story is that Winship and Tart are dispatched by Scotland yard to investigate the death of a British aristocrat and his wife . the kicker is , both are American . it's funny seeing two Americans detectives working for Scotland Yard . Winship dresses just like Holmes and Tart dresses just like Watson . both are inept and clueless , and have caused no shortage of chaos and trouble in the states . apparently they are put on the case as punishment or to keep them from trouble , as they are an embarrassment to their superiors . as part of their investigation , they end up at the huge mansion of the aristocrat , questioning the large staff contingent ( who are also very quirky ) , and bumbling from one false clue to the next . from the opening scene slapstick is the order of the day , and there is a lot of it . the characters are so dimwitted and the situations so absurd , it's hard not to laugh out loud frequently . i really had a blast . it's not high art , but it is entertaining .
teenager is picked on by school bully , hires outcast as bodyguard	my bodyguard is a great family movie , with minimal violence ( even then the violence is a necessary part of the movie ) . there is no foul language that i know of . the fight scenes are done very tastefully . there is bit of humour thrown in as well , mostly in the form of ruth gordon ( grandma ) . the subject matter ( bullying ) is still very relevant today although the movie takes a lighter approach than any movie made today would . it is also simplistic in its approach , though being a family oriented movie , one would expect it to be . the movie does go abit overboard on the inspirational factor and it paints bullying as something much easier to deal with than the reality . watching this film as an adult , it seemed like it could have had more substance . as a child , i remember enjoying it thoroughly . i like to think of it as a low rent " karate kid " even though karate kid was still five years away . my bodyguard will be enjoyed by early teens and a bit younger . parents will enjoy the fact that their kids have a kid friendly movie to watch . 8 stars for kids , 6 stars for adults
very entertaining and politically incorrect 70's game show	even though this game show is from the early seventies , i still really enjoy it . it's not boring at all . in fact it is quite funny at times . there's a lot of things they say that are funny , but they would not get away with today , in this time of political correctness . it's also amusing to see what people wore back then and their hairstyles . man , that's some crazy sht . if you grew up in that era , it certainly is an interesting trip down memory lane , especially if you're the nostalgic type . people were definitely less inhibited back then , and happier , i think . nowadays , any time you wanna do something that goes against convention , it's as if a committee has to study every little detail to make sure no one or their dog ( or cat , or hamster etc . ) gets offended . to me , watching Match game is a very entertaining experience .
very good action adventure movie , with some humour and intrigue	The title League of Extraordinary gentlemen is pretty self explanatory . basically , adventure Allan Quatermain ( Sean Connery ) recruits a group of heroes with various abilities , to take on a villain named the Fantom , and prevent him from starting a World War . the movie takes place in alternate Victorian era . the movie is directed by Stephen Norrington ( Blade ) I enjoyed this film much more than i expected . i really had low expectations , but one day , i saw it cheap and thought what the heck . this one has a lot going for it . lots of action , good special effects , a bit of intrigue and even some humour . i liked the premise and i thought they did a good job with it . i think the movie had the potential to be much worse , but it all worked well . i give this movie a strong
a very thrilling potboiler ( solid )	this is a very thrilling and suspenseful movie . the movie take place in " real time " meaning that the same amount of time that goes by for the audience , also goes by for the characters . for action and excitement and nail biting suspense , this is the movie . great acting all around including Johhny Depp in the lead role , as well s CHristoper Walken and Roma Maffia , to name a few . i was on the edge of my seat for this potboiler , right down to the last minute . the tension was almost unbearable at times . this is one well written suspense thriller which ranks right up there , at least in my mind . but don't take my word for it . run out and rent it . i'll think you'll really enjoy it . for me " Nick of Time " is a solid
rollicking fun on the high seas	i really enjoyed this animated feature . it has something for everyone . there's lots of action and adventure and danger on the high seas . there is also plenty of suspense . i also thought the movie was very witty at times , with some great dialogue . if you're a romance buff , there's some of that too . i thought the animation was spectacular , mixing regular animation with a bit of 3D . the look of the film is fantastic . the voice work is terrific . each voice fit the character perfectly . also the movie is quite fast paced , and never really loses any momentum . i'm not sure what the rating is , but i would give it a PG rating as it gets a bit intense . anyway , all in all , a very fun movie . i give Sinbad : Legend of the Seven Seas a strong
true crime buffs will like it	this documentary type series features 52 minute episodes of crimes committed in the past ( usually one crime per episode ) in which the FBI and local law enforcement cooperate to solve crimes . parts of the crimes are reenacted with actors . throughout the episode a narrator describes the events . real people who were involved in the original investigation are also interviewed in present day and recount their experience with the particular incident . the series is gripping and fast paced , but can be very morbid , as sometimes the particulars of the crimes are fairly well detailed . there isn't always a happy ending , either . if you're a true crime buff and you haven't seen this show i encourage you to check it out . in North America , The 1st season is out on DVD , and the 2nd and 3rd have been announced for release . my vote for The F : B : I : Files is a strong
lives up to the standard set by the first one	call me crazy , but i thought this movie was as good as the first one . true , it is a bit more far fetched and there is less of a story , but it makes up for that in sheer excitement . it's very fast paced from beginning to end . the first one had its share of action , but the action her is on a grander scale . i also liked seeing the different ways Rambo outsmarted and dispatched his enemies . and like the first one , Rambo lets his actions do the talking . he's not one to waste words . this movie is also a indictment of the Vietnam War . a subtle indictment , but it is there , nonetheless . overall , this is one fun movie , better than i remembered it from the last time i had seen it , when it first came out in the theatre . for me Rambo : First Blood Part II is a
outstanding ( may be the best animated Batman adventure to date )	this is a great movie . it has a very good story , good characters , and lots of action . it's also very creepy at times , and there an air of eeriness to the movie . you definitely can fell a sense of danger and jeopardy for both The Batman and the rest of Gotham city . the main villain and the other characters are well written . the movie is very engaging and compelling . as well , the voice acting is very well done . the voices and characters really fit together . this may be the best animated Batamn movie yet , and it ranks right up there with live action movies as well . if you're into Batman , you should enjoy this movie . i have to give " The Batman vs Dracula " a solid
an interesting look at some of the making of " The Railrodder " 1 of Keaton's later films	this is a " National Film Board of Canada " documentary . it chronicles some of the the making of " The Railrodder " , a short film that Keaton did late in his career . it also gives some insight into Keaton and his early life . i thought this was a very good documentary . it was well written , humorous and entertaining . it's just under 1 hour , but there is a lot of info in that time . it is a bit sad to watch , as Keaton is clearly in the end stages of his life . in fact , he died the next year ( 1966 ) . nevertheless , i think the filmmakers did a good job with the film . some of Keaton's Genius is still evident in the film , at least to me . unlike many documentaries , which tend to be drawn out and boring , this 1 is not , at least in my view . if you are a Keaton fan , you might like this documentary . i am , and i give this film .
action , adventure , danger and humour	this a very entertaining and funny " Indian Jones " type of movie . it's also very fast paced with some great visual effects . the acting is not half bad either . this movie is no Academy Award winner , but for sheer entertainment value , it ranks pretty high . their'e not a lot to dislike about this movie . sure it's not realistic , but who cares , it's not supposed to be . i liked the sword fights a lot . i thought they were exciting and well done . there's some funny lines as well and some great sexual tension and chemistry between the two lead characters Rick O'Connell ( Brendan Frasier ) and Evie Carnahan ( Rachel Weisz ) . also John Hannah is very funny as Evie's lazy , cowardly brother Johnathon . all in all , a very entertaining experience . " The Mummy " gets a from me
director's cut of Daredevil - outstanding ! ! !	OK , i finally saw the director's cut of Daredevil and wow ! ! ! . i was impressed . this blows the theatrical version out of the water . this is a whole new movie . the story flows better and makes much more sense . it also has much more of an emotional impact . the running time for this version is longer , but because the story flows so smoothly , it goes by much faster than the theatrical version . i'm not sure what the idiots responsible for releasing the inferior theatrical version were on , but it must have been something very potent . It's obvious studio big wigs don't always have an idea of what constitutes artistic or even technical merit . the director's cut was better made from both a technical and artistic stand point and would have performed much better at the box office . don't even waste your time with the theatrical version . watch the director's cut instead .
a harrowing , authentic movie about the heroes of the U . S Coast Guard ( the rescue swimmers )	i really enjoyed this movie . for one thing , we actually have a movie about real heroes , who are not cocky and arrogant , but do their jobs with little recognition . the heroes i'm talking about are the men and woman of the coast guard , specifically the rescue swimmers . in most cases , they do not know the people they are saving , and many times they they will never know their names . this film focuses on the U . S Coastguard , and stars Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher as the main characters . Costner plays Ben Randall , a legendary rescue swimmer , who , due to a tragedy during his last mission , find himself as the instructor of the Coast Guard's " A " school , where th best of the best are trained . Kutcher plays Jake Fischer , a cocky young , high school swim champion , whose only reason for being there is to beat all the records , most of then held by Randall . from here on , the movie follows the predictable Hollywood formula for this genre . however , it is better than many movie of its type . one reason for that is the realism in the rescue scenes . there are some really harrowing , thrilling moments . the dramatic scenes are also well done . Kevin Costner is very convincing in his role . however , Kutcher really impresses , with his maturity , and dare i say it , depth . he is definitely evolving as a serious actor . Sela Ward has the thankless role as Randall'e neglected wife . her screen time is limited and i got the impression she was sort of coasting along with her character . but to be fair , she isn't really given the screen time needed to bring more depth to the character . that is the nature of role , which is why it is thankless . Andrew Davis ( under Siege , The Fugitive ) directed the Guardian , and did a brilliant job bringing the script by Ron . L Brinkerhoff to life . finally , i should mention the Coast Guard motto : " So Others May Live " . that tells you how selfless these men and women are , putting their lives on the line for people they don't know . it's nice to see them get some recognition , and maybe the movie will inspire people to join the Coast Guard . anyway , although this movie would not be called a masterpiece ( it isn't that kind of move ) it is an excellent film in its own right . I give " The Guardian " a strong
the landmark space fantasy	what can you say about his movie . it set the bar by which all movies to come would be judged , and this was 1977 . i'm talking about the visual effects , which were nothing less than astounding . it still stands up well to any movie in that regard . remember , they didn't have the benefit of CGI back then , so they relied on miniatures . when you add to that , a compelling story and a soon to be iconic villain ( not to mention , the colourful cast of characters ) and you have box office gold . sure , the dialogue may be wooden and stilted at times , but that is overshadowed by the achievement of the film . Besides , the film was marketed at 12 year olds , so they're not gonna care about stupid things like dialogue . The original " Star Wars " or as it is subtitled " a New Hope , was a landmark film and single handedly reinvented the science fiction genre . Obviously
" You're a cliché . You're nowhere , on your way to no place " ( )	i had never seen this movie before . though i had heard a lot of things about it . anyway , i finally watched it today , and i really liked it . i thought it was very well paced . i liked the dialogue . i thought it was clever . the acting was good , but Travolta was outstanding , but very understated . the dance scenes were really good . Travolta looked like natural on the dance floor . i also really liked the 70's disco music . the movie was written very well , overall . it felt really authentic . the only negative thing i can say about the movie , is that it loses some steam towards the end . but as for the ending itself , i liked it . it wasn't your typical Hollywood ending . i think it was realistic . in my opinion , pretty much anyone can relate to this movie , especially if your just an average person with big dreams . depending on your age , this movie might bring back a lot of memories for you . i think it's still relevant today . for me , Saturday Night Fever is a
what a gas !	what a riot this film is , once it gets going . the first 30 minutes are just the setup . from that point on , it's gas . Benny is hysterical in drag . i laughed my but off at his hi-jinks . i even had tears in my eyes at times . this is surely a classic . if not , it should be . Jack Benny of course takes centre stage here , but the supporting performances are very good , as well . it's based on a very successful stage play , but it translates well to the screen . it's also been made into a movie at least once before . if you're a Jack Benny fan , you can't afford to miss this gem . even if you're not a fan of Jack Benny , or don't even know who he is , you should catch this film for the great writing and the slapstick . and it's a good introduction to Benny . for me , Charley's Aunt is a
high energy fun	i liked the original Freaky Friday ( 1976 ) starring a teenage Jodi Foster and Barbara Harris . i thought it was sweet , touching , and funny . this updated version is also really good . it's much higher energy than the original version . the acting by Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan is superb as they play role reversal , Curtis playing the role of the 15 year old daughter Anna , and Lohan playing th role of her mother Tess , while still in their original bodies . of course Anna and her mother have nothing in common , so living in each other's bodies is a real wakeup call . besides the central premise , the movie is formulaic . still . it's fun watching Lohan and Curtis trying to navigate the other one's life . naturally there's a lesson involved , and mom and daughter finally begin to understand each other . anyway really liked it .
very entertaining	once in a while there is a reality TV show that is real and is worth watching . in this case , it happens to be Airline . it's basically a day in the life of the employees at a major airline in the states , and the things they deal with on a daily basis . it's very interesting to see the different types of people they have to put up with . these include drunk people who are not allowed on the plane until they sober up . i found it really entertaining watching these people try to say they're not drunk . they also have to deal with belligerent passengers who don't show up on time for their flight and have a fit saying they will sue . but it's not all negative . there's some fun stuff , as well , like the staff Christmas parties , retirement parties and such . the point ids , this is a very entertaining and sometimes very funny 30 minute show . it's also very enlightening . it really shows you what the employees have to deal with on a daily basis , all the while keeping their cool . the show only lasted two and a half seasons , which is a shame . i think this is one of the better shows out there . i give Airline a
Equal to First Contact as the best of all the Star Trek films	This third ( and presumably final , but who knows ? ) voyage for the crew of The Next Generation , is , in my mind , arguably the best of the Star Trek Series . the only movie that may rival it is First Contact . as for Nemesis , it has everything it requires to be a great film . first there's a decent dose of humour . there are definitely some spectacular space action sequences . the villain is once again , a strong character . there's a bit of romance ( but not too much ) and the movie is quite touching at times . but it never becomes sappy or maudlin . the suspense level is pretty high in this one . the tension reaches nail biting proportions at times . but there is one difference in this Trek movie , as compared to the other ones . that is its dark ( or darker ) tone . there's a much more sinister feel to this one . the film manages to blend all these elements seamlessly . the ending is surprising , and appropriate , i feel . for me , this movie is a
all over the map , but i still enjoyed it	i liked this particular . movie , even though somewhere along the line , it becomes many different movies . it's a teenage slasher flick , with some Red dawn thrown in the mix . the characters suddenly become either Rambo , or Ripley , from the original Alien series . the plot twist are telegraphed a mile away . i will admit there are some pretty exciting scenes , and my adrenaline was pretty high at times . there are many more fight scenes between the two title characters . and even though the movie is all over the place , i still enjoyed it . the theatrical version of this film was rated R or 18A in Canada , and the unrated version ( which i watched ) promised more gore and scenes too shocking for theatres . honestly though , many TV shows are just as graphic and violent and usually have a 14A rating . it really bugs me when studios come out with these unrated versions with scenes too shocking for theatres . i have yet too see any unrated movie contain any scenes too shocking for theatres . too me , this is a cheap marketing gimmick and false advertising . anyway , back to the movie . despite it's problems , i still enjoyed it immensely . for me , AVPR : Alien vs Predator-Requiem is a
terrific animated film that the whole family should enjoy	this is the only version of Ben Hur that i have seen so far , so i can't compare it to other versions . i will say i really enjoyed this animated version . it's a combination of traditional and 3d animation . visually it is very stunning . the details are very rich vivid . the movie clocks in at less than 90 minutes , but there is a lot jammed into that time . Charlton Heston , who played Ben Hur in the 1950's version is back as the voice of Ben Hur . as i watched the end credits , i noticed that many voice actors portrayed several different characters . i found this amazing , as the characters each had their own distinct sound . i would not have known this if i hadn't watched the end credits . to me , this is a testament to the skill of the performers . this movie is very family friendly , with just one or two scenes that may be a bit intense for young children , so parents may want to preview the movie first before their little ones watch it . this is a great movie overall in my opinion , and well worth watching . my rating is for the animated version of " Ben Hur " .
new shoes ? 30$ - - - - - - Million Dollar Baby ? priceless	every once in awhile , a movie comes along that defies description . Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby is that movie . One of the best movies ever made by one of the greatest directors , this is a movie that will not leave you untouched . Paul Haggis ( Crash ) wrote the screenplay for this cinematic treasure and the stage was set . with Eastwood as Director , the next piece of puzzle was the cast . And what a cast . You have Hilary Swank in a moving , powerhouse performance in the lead role . you have Eastwood himself in strong supporting role . and you have the great Morgan freeman in an understated , but no less superb performance . these three make it seem so effortless . the rest of the supporting players are also strong . I don't want to give too much away , for those who haven't had the pleasure yet . the basics of the film are as follows . Hilary Swank is Maggie Fitzgeraldd a woman who has nothing-but a desire to be a boxer . Eastwood plays Frankie Dunn , a grizzled boxing trainer , hardened by life . Morgan freeman is Eddie Dupris aka " Scrap " , Frankie's lone friend and Manager of his boxing club . Maggie walks into Frankie's life one day , desperate for him to train her . Frankie refuses at first and Maggie never gives up . Frankie finally relents ( with a bit of help from " scrap " . and the stage is set . What follows is the growing relationship between Maggie , Frankie and " Scrap " and the lessons they learn nd teach each other . until the end , with a closing act you won'soon ( if ever ) forget .
shattering !	this film was amazing . it's basically a story of loss , revenge , redemption and forgiveness . there are two main characters , for both of whom redemption and forgiveness seem impossible . both have suffered loss , but only one seeks revenge . the movie tells the story of how our main characters get to the point of redemption and forgiveness , and it's not how you'd think . at least it wasn't for me . Jack Nicholson puts in what i would call a career performance here , as does David Morse . Sean Penn wrote the script and directed the movie . he did a masterful job in both areas . it's emotionally very powerful , and i shed some tears in some scenes . the only downside i can think of for this film , is for me , there was a bit too much unnecessary nudity . i realise that there had to be some to give . us an idea of one of the main characters , but i think it went a bit overboard . still the rest of the movie is so well done , that i give it a
stellar performances from Henry Fonda and Tony Curtis	boy , this was a great movie . the acting by both Henry Fonda and Tony Curtis was really something . these are two phenomenal actors . Fonda was terrific as the head of a task force on the ' Strangler ' case . his performance was very sublime and understated but brilliant . Curtis as ALbert Desalvo gives a powerful , riveting performance . i also liked the film itself . it was kind of low key , but very atmospheric and effective . it was made in 1968 , only a few years after the stranglings . the filmmakers have their ideas about the events and their own take own things . some of it was no doubt fictionalized , and some of it likely came from what was known about the case at the time . regardless , in my opinion , this is a very good movie . it's entertaining and thought provoking . even if it was just entertaining , it would still be a good movie . but if a movie can be both , that's a bonus . on top of all that , it was way better than i had hoped or expected . it's not for everyone , i'm sure due to the subject matter , and some people may find it slow . but for me , i have to say " The Boston Strangler " is a
eye opening insightful look at the life of Muhammad Ali ( must see )	this is a fascinating , revealing and insightful look at Muhammad Ali and the impact he had in America . the movie is pretty comprehensive and in depth . it's also very heartbreaking . it chronicles his life as a young man just starting out as a boxer and up to his life in 2001 . ther's no doubt he was brash and very confident in the ring . but he was also very savvy and a great showman . he very easily psyched out his opponents , giving them a handicap before the fight even began . he was also a great self promoter and extremely charismatic . he often boasted " I am the Greatest " and as a showman he had no equal . he also was a great fighter with super hand speed and lighting quick reflexes and amazing foot work . these skills diminished over time of course , ( but his spirit never , and still hasn't , diminished ) allowing his opponents to hit him much more often and Ali should have hung up the gloves long before he did . unfortunately the accumulation of bows to his head over the course of this career cause the brain affliction of Parkinson's syndrome , a common condition in boxers . but this movie is about more than a boxer . it's a bout a man who stood up for what he believed in , never wavering , and refusing to give into the racism of the time and the government's attempts to make him go abroad to fight in the Vietnam war against people he had no quarrel with in war he believed to be unjust . Ali was and still is an inspiration to his generation and beyond . one thin's for sure , there never was , nor will there ever be another like him . despite his affliction , he remains positive about life and is is mentally strong . love him or hate him , you can't deny the impact he has had . finally , i was sickened by how ignorant many of the white people of the time were and how evil they could be in their treatment of their fellow man because of something as stupid as having different skin . those people are also useless pieces of sht and don't deserve to live with real human beings . hopefully , they will all burn in hell forever . anyway , for me , " Muhammad Ali : Through the Eyes of the World " is a must see . i give it
brilliantly executed , hysterical road trip comedy	Harold and Kumar is about 2 stoner buddies who decide one night that they have to go to White Castle , a burger chain which they believe make the best burgers in the state . upon finding that the nearest White Castle is no longer in business , they set out a hysterical road trip across the state to find on e that is open . what follows is a series of hysterical misadventures and comedy of errors . this movie is one of the funniest movies ever made . it is easily in my top 3 comedies . brilliantly written , great acting from the 2 leads . the movie flows so smoothly , it's unreal . i was wiping tears from my eyes from laughing from beginning to end . my stomach was so sore it took me days to recover . but the experience was more than worth it . check it out out . you won't be disappointed . 10 +
