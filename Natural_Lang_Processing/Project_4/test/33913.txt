Orwell would have been shocked !	I don't get Big Brother . I read George Orwell's novel 1984 where we are introduced to Big Brother , the watcher of all of us or at least in this case , these poor suckers who choose to live together under close watch by millions of poor Britons . This is the not the masterpiece theater exported around the world . This television show is all the rage in England on Channel 4 no less . They spend countless hours observing these young Britons and my sister loves it but I can't take it . I'm going to give the show a 2 because Imogen reacted when she was kicked out like I would have . I would have been begging the audience to get me off this sinking ship . I'm sorry but this is degrading to both sexes and the young . Who wants to be exploited for a hundred thousand pounds ? I wouldn't do it for less than a million and I don't think I would survive . Let me answer questions or do something with my mind . Nicki's screaming is unbearable and the gay Canadian is annoying . Is there a requirement that there must be one gay or lesbian person in the group . The couples won't last off the set . Sorry folks , don't let your children be watching this rubbish as they say and I agree . This show is appalling to watch and can be addictive . I'm glad that I'm in my thirties and not my twenties .
I'm not crazy about this one !	You would think that Ron Howard , the veteran of Happy Days and Andy Griffith Show , would get why I am not crazy about this show . Unlike Happy Days and the Andy Griffith Show , Arrested Development lacks warmth in it's main family . One of the many reasons people watch family oriented sitcoms is because they like the family . As much as I tried to like this show , I couldn't get pass the characters . Except for Jason Bateman , the show never really catches my attention . Jeffrey Tambor is always wonderful but he is not enough . I found this show to be confusing and often bewildering . I wanted to like this show and I tried but I never caught on like the critics . One of the many reasons that we watch the same sitcoms over and over is for the laughs and because we like the family or the cast of characters . I found this group to be unlikable and shallow and I am sorry that I am not a critic . But I think if you look at all the popular sitcoms in history , you will find that the characters who became endearing to its audience won both critics and fans . Just look at them again .
It's not that Awful !	First , I love Canada and Vancouver , it's a gorgeous city often used for filming locations . Finally a film set in Vancouver but we don't see any sights . You can tell it's a Kevin Smith film whether he produced or financed it himself . I see him at the party with his buddy Jason Mawes who played Az . Jason Lee without his famous mustache is quite believable as Donner , the man who seeks to find Bigfoot in British Columbia but cons his friends into going with him on a camping trip until they straighten their messed up empty lives . In the beginning , all of the characters live off the Canadian government with no desire to get jobs or seek a respectable living . Once they are cut off from welfare , Donner convinces the gang to visit his uncle's cabin in the deep woods of British Columbia but Donner has other motives . There is too much cursing or swearing going on here in the film . We never get to know the real characters . While the directors of this film are new , I believe in time that they will rise to better directors . I am donating my DVD to entertain the troops overseas . I have to say that Vancouver is always worth visiting and the directors should spend more time setting and filming in that wonderful mecca .
a mixed bag of goods !	This film is not one of the director's finest works despite it's all star cast with enough twists and turns for a roller coaster ride at an amusement park . Ben Affleck plays an ex-convict whose cell mate gets killed in a prison fight . Ben's character , Rudy , meets up with Ashley played by Charlize Theron . Just remember , nobody is truly what they appear to be in this film . Ashley's brother , Gabriel , is played by the under-rated Gary Sinise who is far more deadly than any of Rudy's prison pals . First , they think Rudy is truly Nick Cassidy , a former casino worker . The mixed-up identity allows Rudy to spend some quality time with Ashley . By the time of revelations , nobody is truly what they seem to be and relationships are revealed that are not always proper . I think Rudy / Nick learns the truth about Ashley's life . By the end of the film , you're actually cheering for Rudy because he turns out to be the hero but I won't say how he does it or what happens . I don't want to spoil the film's ending .
A mixture of truth and fiction !	Okay if you know the true story about Martha Beck and Raymond Martinez Fernandez , you would know that Martha Beck was an overweight nurse , single mother of two children that she abandoned . The casting of Selma Hayek is fine but they make no attempt in allowing her to be Martha Beck . She is too glamorized in this role . I have no problem with Jared Leto in the role of Raymond . Of course , my biggest problem with the film is the concentration on the cops played by John Travolta and James Gandolfini . While the costume designs , acting , and directing are first rate , the writers and director does take artistic liberties . I actually felt bad for the characters of Beck and Fernandez even though their main motives was to profit from the dead of unsuspecting women like Janet Fay who was actually 66 years old but played by a much younger actress . I felt that the film is worth watching but it's painful to watch at times .
Can't figure it out !	I don't know about this film . I have watched it a couple of times and I don't get it . Maybe it's because I think the story is a little weak . I love Sir Michael Caine , Nigel Green , and Sue Lloyd in their roles but I think the story was slow-moving . Maybe the film was supposed to take off after the James Bond film hit when most of the films begin to copy each other . I love the scene in the supermarket . The espionage and secrecy during the Cold War is interesting but I will have to watch it again to get it . As for the film itself , the quality is good and the movie doesn't do too much or overdue the plot line . You have to watch for Caine's character and the Ipcress file to see what it is all about . It's a must for Caine fans and anybody of the British cinema .
Get Mama in Shape !	When Mama Harper enters an arm wrestling contest as the Bigger Jigger , she wins against a biker-type tattooed man . She wins the contest after tricking him and gaining his sympathy . The next contest is when she has to go arm wrestle somebody of her age and weight for fairness . The family and Iola does their best to get her in shape for the event which is far the funniest part of the episode . When the biker man brings his equally tough Mama played by Kathleen Freeman who does a fantastic job in the role , Mama goes arm to arm until she learns that her son and daughter-in-law have bet their life savings over the contest which means they will have to stay forever with Mama Harper .
Dame Juliet rules this show !	I have been a found of Juliet Mills since I was a child . Little did I know that she would marry the gorgeous and 18 year old her junior , Maxwell Caulfield , from Grease 2 . Not only that , they have been almost 25 years too . Besides , Juliet Mills ' Tabitha would delight her departed godfather Lord Laurence Oliver and her godmother Vivien Leigh . Her acting father , Sir John Mills , should have guested once on this show . He died recently at 97 years old . While I am crazy about Juliet too , the show has improved since it's debut in 1999 . I really wish Juliet won the Emmy Award last night . Without her , this show would have bite the dust like All My Children without Susan Lucci . I hope we can honor Juliet by getting her something else like an M . B . E . ( Member of the British Empire ) . The last British born actress in daytime to receive this honor was Anna Lee in 1982 from Majesty Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace . I know an M . B . E . is a lower honor than an O . B . E . ( Officer of the British Empire ) , a C . B . E . ( Commander of the British Empire ) or Dame Commander of the British Empire but Juliet should be rewarded with something . Since nobody at All My Children appears not to care about Eileen Herlie who has played Myrtle Fargate since the seventies , maybe the Passions fans would be more willing to do something . It only costs postage ! There is nothing much more than that . There is no $15 , 000 to upkeep a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame which Juliet deserves too . Anybody who knows anything about an M . B . E . knows that it goes to ordinary people who do extraordinary things or for years of service . But for soaps even in England , the M . B . E . has been bestowed upon British actors on Coronation Street and EastEnders . Please help me do something to honor this special lady .
Let's All Just Get Along !	Kelly probably has never heard that saying before . Bethenny makes a sly comment about Kelly's behavior at a charity fund-raising for Jill's charity about juvenile arthritis . Kelly has Bethenny meet up with her at the Brass Monkey bar downtown in New York for a heated confrontation . Neither need each other , Bethenny is still spurned by Kelly flirting with her then boyfriend two years ago and has never recovered from it . Kelly comes across as too aggressive . Maybe that's what the producers want , a little action and little peace in the show . I didn't care for it personally . I thought the confrontation was hyped up for effect . I still would like everybody to get along . Is that so wrong or so bad in this world ?
Don't Know What the Fuss was all about !	I never really liked this perhaps because I felt Michael Boatman's performance as the homosexual character was kind of a token gay character . The show first revolved around Michael J . Fox as Mike Flaherty who works for New York City mayor played by Barry Bostwick . The supporting cast included Alan Ruck , Richard Kind , and others . Fox left the show because of his health and Heather Locklear and Charlie Sheen took over becoming a different show . I think they were more interesting than when Fox was on because it was more about Alex P . Keaton grown up . I felt the show revolved around Fox for the first few years until he left allowing Charlie Sheen to become a sitcom star on his own merit .
The Baby Boom of Television	Maybe it was the writers ' strike in 1988 that helped bring in the television recession of bad comedies and dramas , despite being based on the film of the same name and the same adorable identical twins playing Baby Elizabeth . The show could have worked if the network allowed it too . Kate Jackson replaced Diane Keaton as J . C . Wiatt and Jackson is a worthy television replacement for such a role . But the story was changed when they moved J . C . back to New York City with Baby Elizabeth . I liked it better in Vermont and thought that the move could be disastrous . The show became another series in itself with the same child but different mother . Regardless , I think they could bring this series out on DVD with the movie .
A cute fun movie	I bought Earthly Possessions because they filmed some scenes in New Jersey's Ocean Grove which is doubled as Perth , South Carolina . I really liked the chemistry between Sarandon and Dorff to surprise me . It is such a surprise delight and worth a viewing . It is well written with a somewhat believable story . It has solid acting performances by Stephen Dorff and Oscar winner , Susan Sarandon . Anyway , the film begins with a hostage played by Sarandon who is an unhappy housewife trying to get away from her life and marriage . Dorff's character is desperate for some money . The leads provide an entertaining interaction between two very different characters .
Lose a Promotion and Gain a Dream !	When Vint loses a job promotion , the family takes him out to the Bigger Jigger Bar and Restaurant where it is Amateur Night . To lift his spirits , Mama , Naomi , and Fran all suggest for him to go on stage with his Fred Astaire number and sing " Puttin on the Ritz " with Fran on the piano like he did at a recent family reunion . By the way , I believe Ken Berry began his career in vaudeville or tap-dancing into show business . Regardless , he knows how to tap-dance . When he wins the prize of $100 . 00 and is going to perform for an upcoming night . He decides to change his name to Johnny something , give up the hat and cane , and Fran on the piano . Of course , Mama realizes that the contest has turned him into a monster which makes Naomi the bride of Frankenstein .
Not bad but not great !	Mama's silver is one of the most valuable items in their home . She is nervous when her own daughter , Ellen , borrows it for a dinner party and returns it home . In this episode , we get Aunt Fran and Ellen for a change together . Mama goes nuts when she discovers her silverware is missing . It turns out that her darling dim-witted son , Vint , has pawned them off to bail a friend out of jail . The same friend who landed him back at home with Mama and who thinks of ways to make a quick buck . Claude Cainmaker is back in Vint's life as his best friend . Desperate , Vint asks Ellen for the money but she says I never lend anybody money ever .
They've Had Enough !	Iola helps the family in a difficult situation . She suggests that Vint and Naomi switch rooms with Bubba . Being outvoted , Mama doesn't think it's a good idea but they go through with it anyway . We meet Bubba's friends , Dwayne , and T-Boy in this episode . Boys will be boys since they want to have a band of their own while Vint and Naomi find the upstairs is not entirely what they expected themselves . When Mama flees the nest for a bit , Iola and the Harpers have come to realize that Mama was right along but how do you confront the situation . This episode was fine because it examined the friction between the family and house mates in Mama's house . After all , she owns the house and she can put anybody anywhere .
It should have been Sir Roddy McDowall !	It should have been Sir Roddy McDowall in my opinion . Why he never got knighted for his contributions to acting and drama , I will never know . This episode also feature Ida Lupino , another legendary actress , writer and director herself . Sir Roddy as I will call him plays a genius character who wants too much from his stepfather who played the evil Vice Presidential candidate in the original Manchurian Candidate . His plan is ingenious but there are exceptions being that Sir Roddy's character is still no match for Lieutenant COlumbo's genius . You have to laugh with him at the end of the film . Like most COlumbo episodes , you have to pay attention . We know who kills the character but how does Columbo catch him or her in some cases is just as fascinating as the episodes themselves .
It May Be Set in Paradise ! But It's not Paradise !	Watching Dog is quite interesting . I have to admit that I don't find him attractive in the least . Maybe it's the tattoos and the hair , he does act more like a professional wrestler . His wife and partner , Beth Smith , is his perfect match . His sons also help in bringing runaway bail breakers to justice . If these people were smart , they would realize that breaking bail is a serious offense anyway . I can't believe that this is all happening on the beautiful , idyllic Hawaiian Islands . Obviously , I have never been to Hawaii but long to go . They show a side of Hawaii that's not in the tour books because life in Hawaii does have a price in itself . It has crime , poverty , unemployment , and drugs as well . As a tourist , we would only see what the tour books write about . But at least Dog and his gang are showing us that even in paradise , crime occurs . They could do this anywhere but the fact that they are based in Hawaii shows us that even in paradise , you can't escape the pitfalls of life .
A Stork Pays A Visit to Harper House !	Naomi Oates Harper is not feeling well lately . She has all the symptoms of being pregnant and of course , she and Vint have been practicing but there are not ready to have a baby since they live with Vint's mother and Aunt Fran and his two teenage kids , Buzz and Sonja . In this episode , Naomi thinks she's pregnant and Mama assures her that she is because of a silly test . She asks the right questions and suggests her own baby doctor who is deceased . Naomi insists on getting her own doctor . Once Naomi's news becomes known to the family without the actual test results , questions arise as to whose room will be turned into a nursery . The family starts fighting amongst themselves and it turns ugly . Naomi can't believe she married into a selfish family , that can't be news to her . In the end , it's resolved but it's still memorable .
A Delightful uneven show !	I like My Family . NJN started showing it in the place of " Last of the Summer Wine " or what I like to call " British version of Desperate Housewives . " I much prefer them to anything on television . In fact , I love British comedies and I only saw My Family briefly on a British Airways flight 2 years ago so now I have it at least once a week . I love Zoe Wanamaker C . B . E . and Tony winning Robert Lindsay although the children actors have to compete with such talent . It's nice to see a British family for a change . On British shows , children are often never shown . I loved the premiere pilot with the bunny rabbit and would gladly give it a home . I thought it was cute that Zoe and Lindsary were talking to him like a member of the family . I look forward to more episodes of this show . BBC should do more to create comedies . I always prefer the Brits to the American comedies any day .
If you love Neil Diamond ! You'll Love This Film !	Okay , Neil Diamond is the celebrity who plays himself for a trio of friends who idolize him for his music . While some of us may not care for Diamond , I think he's a talented singer and entertainer . Well , Silverman and his two pals played by the wonderful and under-rated Steve Zahn and the always funny Jack Black decided that Silverman's fiancée , Judith , played well by Amanda Peet should not marry Darren Silverman because it would ruin their lives . They believe Darren is still in love with Sandy who might become a nun after taking her final vows . So after staging Judith's death , J . D . ( Jack Black ) and Wayne ( Steve Zahn ) kidnap and plan to kill but they can't . Anyway , she uses the whole situation to work in her favor . Oh , let's not forget the crazy high school coach who is also involved . The film is not so bad and it's okay after awhile . It grows on you .
An Animated Movie for Adults and Children !	It's rare than an animated movie like Hoodwinked can entertain both children and adults . The movie is set around the story of Little Miss Riding Hood known as Red voiced by Anne Hathaway . Glenn Close provides the voice of the Granny . There is a story and plot about recipes , evil rabbit , and animals who come to life speaking and a frog . The language and the script itself is smart with jokes to entertain the adults while the children viewers will be glued to the screen for it's first rateanimation . Today's animation makes the past animated classics look like children's work . Technology has come a long away and animators today are computer savvy and smart enough to use it for their own advantages . We'll see a lot more animated films in the future .
The Great American Hero is Satisfactory at Best !	Just think of this premise for a television show , a teacher becomes a superhero with a silly red costume reminiscent of Superman with powers and abilities that he doesn't understand at all . He has help with supporting players like Robert Culp and Connie Sellecca . The show only last 30 episodes with William Katt playing the starring role . Somehow the show became a cult favorite in syndication when some shows that did not last as long appeared weekly like this show . Anyway it's catchy theme song is worth watching for anyway . The show missed but it was a hit in the sense that it maintained a cult following . Who cares if it never made a 100 episodes ? It's now on DVD for all of us to enjoy .
It could have been worse !	Columbo always likes to get his man or woman . This time , it's Robert Foxworth who plays a military man . Sam Wanamaker better known and respected for his role in rebuilding the Shakespeare Globe Theater on the Thames in London , England returns to direct a Columbo . He is a veteran director and it shows . Of course , I think it could have been better . The writing was a bit weaker than most and I think it could have been a lot better in the acting department but I love Columbo and I have seen almost all of them many times . I think even the casting would have been better besides just Falk and Foxworth in the roles but I'll take Columbo with the good , the bad , the ugly , and sometimes brilliant episodes .
Vintage Beverlee ! !	Before Beverlee McKinsey returned to daytime in her final long-term role , she had a guest appearance on Remington Steele as Alexis Vanderveer . Beverlee chews up the scenery in the same way that dogs chew bone but she's always fun to watch and enjoy . Even this episode where it showed some of her brilliance as family matriarch and demanding mother . I wished that she would come out of retirement for another stab at acting regardless of the role . With Beverlee , she can make it worth it . Vintage Steele is about Laura's old flame coming to see her and help him with a dead man in the trunk . Who knew in 1982 that it was supposed to be drama ? Laura , Steele , and her ex-boyfriend travel to the wine country where you get vintage in order to solve the mystery . Upon going there , they meet Alexis and her horses . Too bad , Beverlee McKinsey has given up acting and retired . We miss you , Beverlee .
A rare disturbing film for even the most mature adults !	I want people watch this film with an open mind but they have to be mature and understanding . Alan Strang is disturbed young man who has a disturbed fascination with horses . He places them in the godlike category . His relationship only gets worse when he works at a stable barn . There , he has almost a bestial relationship with the animals there . When he finally confronts a relationship with a fellow stable girl played nicely by Jenny Agutter . When he feels watched and betrays his god , he commits the most disturbing crime . Warning , this film is not for children or some adults with weak stomachs . There is full nudity of both Firth and Agutter in the movie . There also wonderful performances by Dame Eileen Atkins and Dame Joan Plowright in this film .
A Great Film for Adult and Kids !	I was a bit surprised that the film was not entirely animated . No , I did not read the book . The boy actor is fine here as is Joanna Lumley OBE and Miriam Margolyes OBE as his despicable aunts , Spiker and Sponge , who get custody of him as a child . They really are deliciously evil in their roles and they look like they are having a ball at it too . I thought the story was quite interesting with the animation and live action . The film is good for both adults and children as well as family can view it together . I thought the costumes of Spike and Sponge were hilarious . You could not tell that Spiker also plays half of Absolutely fabulous from this role . The make-up , the costumes , and visual effects are worth watching and it's good to watch this film .
A Superior but Flawed ARtistic Film !	Andy Garcia gives an award winning performance as Italian Jewish artist , Amedeo Modigliani , in this film about his tragic life . He was madly in love with a French Catholic woman , Jeanne , whose father made it impossible for them to be together . Regardless , Jeanne would sacrifice custody of their own daughter in order to be with him . She just couldn't live without him . The supporting cast is quite good with Miriam Margolyes OBE playing Gertrude Stein ( where was Alice B . Toklas ? ) in this film . The film was filmed on location in Paris . Pablo Picasso , Jean Cocteau and other famed artists of that period were also portrayed but my main problem with this film was the lack of clarity in this film . It's a worthy effort but it could have done a little better .
A Chilling Wedding Scenario !	A young bride is getting married . She receives a note from the priest via a woman who entered the church before the ceremony . It reads that the person you may be marrying is a serial killer . Despite her doubts , she goes through with the wedding ceremony at the church . Her brother has yet to appear . Her husband's parents died under a cloud of mystery . She begins to wonder why the woman would leave such a horrendous note . Her new husband makes a confession but it is not until the end which we know the truth about the mystery woman , the note , and who it was for . It was kind of great moment but it ended too soon without an explanation as to why it happened . I thought it was chilling and original and the kind of series that I looked forward to seeing again on television . I haven't been than interested in a television show in a long time that kept me up so late in a long time .
A Superior but Flawed Film Version !	I haven't read Somerset Maugham's novel entitled Theatre which the film was adapted into this film . While the film has a first rate cast , I kept thinking that the role of Julia Lambert could have been equally brilliantly played by Juliet Stevenson CBE who was playing Edie , Julia's long-time personal assistant . Miriam Margolyes OBE again plays a lesbian producer in this film who loves Julia almost as much as Julia loves herself . She is constantly followed by her old acting teacher played by Sir Michael Gambon . The film is about Julia who needs to find herself again . She finds love in a younger lover and wanted to consummate with an old friend who kindly tells her that he's playing for the other side . Jeremy Irons plays her husband and producer . The couple are quite a complement to each other . Julia retreats to visit her mother played by the divine Rosemary Harris and her Aunt Carrie played by Rita Tushingham . But still , Annette Bening does a superb job in making you feel for Julia Lambert .
A funny episode !	Mama's Family has turn in a charming episode where Bubba sticks Mama's head on a sexy body and puts it on a poster to place around town for a senior citizens gathering . When she gets there with Iola , the men are old , hot , and sweaty for her attention . They want to do more than just dance with her and the senior women are upset with the poster and Mama's sexuality suggested . When Mama gets a look at the poster , she is shocked to see her head put on somebody else's body . The poster was supposed to encourage men to see that nice , senior women are still out there and available . I liked this episode and it made use of IOla and Bubba as well while Vint and Naomi are expecting their baby in the series . I think they were running out of ideas by this season but I still would watch again and again .
One of the better episodes !	Bubba Higgins enters his grandmother into a beauty contests for Grandmothers with Naomi's picture . When they mistake Naomi for a grandmother at the beauty pageant , Mama speaks up and makes a poor claim that her elbow is in the picture . Most of the episode is centered around the pageant episode . There is a lot of tap-dancing with some of the grandmothers . Don't forget Ken Berry is an accomplished tap dancer and choreographer . Of course , Mama has to answer the question that every woman dreads . Despite the contest , this episode is memorable because of the cast and the guest actresses who play other pageant contestants .
It's cute and sometimes a little much at times !	How would BRidget JOnes write this in her diary about her life ? This film is a cute , comedic unrealistic commentary on women in their thirties like Bridget JOnes played beautifully by Texas American Renee Zellwegger . A role that could have been done by any British actress striving for her big break has been done by one of Hollywood's brightest rising stars . Renee can sure play British and she also plays Beatrix Potter . THe casting choice of her to play this very British role might be shocking but she manages to do this role without being Meryl Streep and being more a talent to watch out for . Bridget's parents are played by the underrated Gemma JOnes and Oscar Winner Jim Broadbent . Colin Firth and Hugh Grant play the men who seek to win Bridget's heart . Firth plays Darcy here and in the 1995 Pride and Prejudice television mini-series and Hugh Grant is famous for playing the lovable loser at love . The film was filmed mostly in London and England . Although you can't stand in any airport for JFK in NEw York City . Any way , the film is a lot of fun to watch and should be shown over the Christmas holiday season .
It's a must for Streep fans !	It may be one of Meryl Streep's most daring performances as a river rider . With Kevin Bacon as a sleazy robber and murderer . He is awfully good at being bad . Overall , the movie is a good thrill ride . It lacks swearing and the violence is minimal too . It's just so predictable but not unbearable . This is a Curtis Hanson film before L . A . Confidential . It's a good film because we see Meryl practice her sign language . Meryl never gives more than 100 percent even in this role as a woman . David Straitharn plays her husband from Boston in this film . He would later get nominated for his role in Good Night and Good Luck . Kevin Bacon is fun to watch as the evil robber and murderer . You will just have to wait and see the ending as predictable as it is . It's still a thrill ride .
An Excellent and Entertaining Civil Action !	Okay , I wasn't too keen on courtroom dramas . I only happened to come across this one by accident . I was really impressed but of course , I always get the end of the drama . The cast is first rate with Oscar nominee John Travolta , Emmy Winner Tony Shaloub as his colleague , Oscar nominee William H . Macy as his financial adviser , Kathy Bates has a tiny role at the very end , Kathleen Quinlan is always dynamic as the bereaved mother seeking justice for the death of her son , Sydney Pollack has a role as Jan's opponent . Jan is Travolta's character who is a Cornell educated attorney who seeks justice rather than reap it's financial rewards . This film came after Erin Brockovich but I think this is the more effective film . The characters and the actors who bring them alive are realistic about a Boston suburb of Woburn who loses 8 children after toxic dumping and hazardous wastes in the local river failed to implicate the true nature of it's affects and actions . You can't help but root for Jan who loses everything financially like his home , his business , and is in credited to debtors and the repose man like anybody else . He does it for justice and not much more .
Why it's still standing ?	Simple , it can be a very entertaining show . Mark Addy who is British plays Chicago Bill Miller . Mark is better known for his performances in The Fully Monty and the British comedy classic , The Thin Blue Line . Mark does a first rate job at making Bill Miller into a blue collar American every man . His co-star Jami Gertz better remembered for her roles in the 1980s films , The Lost Boys , and Sixteen Candles does an equally fantastic job at playing Judy Miller . They were the couple from high school who married and had children . I love watching Sally Struthers play Bill's mom . She's fabulous and under-rated as a performer . She can do more than just play whining Gloria from All in the Family . Anyway the plots don't do the talent justice for the family . It was a surprise hit because I think we just miss family comedies . I think the actors who play the children also do a fantastic job at making us believe in them . Overall , it's a good show but not great . It's writing could be stronger to make this cast shine .
You can love it or hate it but Erika Slezak is one of America's finest acting treasures !	Erika Slezak has won 6 Emmy awards for playing the same role . She beat Susan Lucci most of the those times . I don't think people understand her acting ability which I consider to be on par with the finest actors and actresses today like Dame Judi Dench , Vanessa Redgrave , and Julie Harris . She has played a multiple personality disorder as well as played Victoria Lord for 35 years with class , elegance , and style that most people would envy . While lots of actors and actresses have come and gone , Erika stayed on playing a role that did not define her personal life . As All My Children is about another Erica , One Life to Live has provided a place for Erika Slezak who is also the heart and soul of the show itself to grow . It's an amazing show because it really does the unthinkable , unimaginable , and the absurd too . I can't forget the others on the show like Robin Strasser who plays Dorian Lord , Philip Carey who plays cowboy Asa Buchanan , Robert S . Woods who plays his son Bo . Can you imagine having cowboys in Llanview , Pennsylvania ? but it work's with great actors and actresses . The absurd story lines are both entertaining and silly but even worth watching . If you like serious drama , this show is not for you . If you like fun entertainment , this is the show for you .
It could have had a future !	Of all the television shows that I have seen , good or bad , I remember Lottery for some strange reason . It was never the hit that should have been . It taught us that life can change for the better or worse with wealth . It was interesting that these two men always had $5 , 000 with them and a check to unsuspecting people . I never bought that part of the story . I remember when Mabel King was a church organist and she was awarded her lottery winnings . I remember when a couple threw the money and check out into the garbage only to get another check but no 5 , 000 grand . I never understood why the amounts were different from week to week but I didn't care . It was one of the few shows that I remember from the 1980s that never gained enough fans to keep it on the air longer . IT was a decent melodrama with all the elements of watching guest stars become millionaires when they worried about money . If only Lottery was that true .
A Surprising Guest Appearance by one of America's Acting Treasures !	Let's face it , getting Julie Harris to appear in an episode of Family Ties must have been a hoot . She plays an older mature woman returning to college and is one of Mallory's classmates . Of course , the woman befriends Mallory and tries to bond with her despite Mallory's resistance and reservations about being linked to an older woman . When Margaret Hollings ' gets a little too close to Mallory , she backs off seeking the relationship of her peers . Mallory's still at that stage where you are still seeking acceptance of your peers . Anyway Freshman Mallory feels bad about the situation and rectifies it in her own way . We love Julie Harris and we can't imagine another actress playing this small role that remains to be one of it's better episodes . Anyway , it could have been written better but the cast was always outstanding on this show .
Capital City should be on DV	I agree that Capital City should be on DVD . I watched this show only by accident in 1994 and fell in love with Rolf Saxon as Hudson Talbot . It was nice to see Americans who work abroad in London in the financial industry for a change . I loved Rolf in this role and loved every other role that he has been in . I can't believe the show only lasted 13 episodes . I liked William Armstrong as Hudson's flamboyant charming friend in the series . When they aired this show in the New York City area , it was always late at night or at off times . The show is less than an hour long . I felt this show should have gone on longer but the casting changes in the second season really made the show a little less interesting . I didn't care for Sylvia but missed the actress , Julia Phillips-Lane in the previous season . I felt this show took chances and often it worked . It showed Americans who loved and chose to live in London . The American characters were not arrogant or tried to outdo their British counterparts . I also liked the fact that they had tried to internationalize the cast rather than make them all British . I liked watching Julia Ormond in an early role . I felt this show should have lasted longer . I felt at times that the previews lasted as long as the show in less than an hour . They could have transferred the cast to New York City and it would have been a hit in America .
Not Stone's Best Film to Date !	I don't think this is Stone's best film to date . In fact , I loved JFK and consider it to be a masterpiece . Platoon is a war film and I'm not crazy about war films in general but Stone's direction and personal experience with Vietnam is clearly an effective tool in this film's brilliance . It's raw , ugly , dirty , and filthy but then what war isn't any of those things ? As far as Vietnam films , I preferred the Deer Hunter but I am going to say that Platoon goes further where other films have not gone before . It's different when the director has been there and done it himself as a Vietnam veteran like Roman Polanski who survived World War II POland as a child . There is nothing that they are not afraid to show as if they are holding something back . This film is about war and the young men who go only to return home differently . As far as I know , this film is still important today as it was twenty years ago . First rate cast include Charlie Sheen , Tom Berenger , and other young men .
James Earl Jones is terrific in this role !	I remember when this show came on the air and how it ended . It was a terrible shame because James Earl Jones is one of our country's finest actors . Finally , he gets a series of his own but the show never really gained a large following after a season and was canceled by the network . It did have a terrific cast and won Emmys for James Earl Jones and others but the show never truly caught on because it was more character based than action based . For those of us who don't care about action packed movies , I prefer a good drama with characters that you can identify with and sympathize . The series was serious and too sophisticated for most audiences today who prefer to escape from their daily troubles . Of course , good drama can still effective without car chases , violence , etc . Gabriel's Fire based on my memory was a decent show with a purpose but the network felt the audiences weren't enough for it to continue in another season .
A Must for Vanessa Redgrave fans !	Erica Noughton is played by the fabulously talented Vanessa Redgrave who believe it or not turned down Damehood in 1999 . She should have been made a Dame years ago but that's another story . Here she is sexy , sensual , and believe it or not is extremely beautiful at her age far more than women half her age . Anyway , she plays child psychologist and is Julia's mother ( what a coup in casting ? ) because she is Joely's real life mother . The scene in the gym between mother and daughter is quite interesting . I love Vanessa Redgrave and I think she is one of the most talented and gifted actresses of our generation . She makes it look so easy . Of course , this episode was the first for me watching Nip / Tuck and I left the show with mixed feelings . Then I returned and realized it's brilliance and have never left it . The scene between her and Christian is unforgettable . You forget that she's old enough to be his mother too .
Stood and Delivered Well !	Stand and Deliver is another movie about life in the classroom and the politics of school . Edward James Olmos earned an Academy Award nomination for his performance as the over-dedicated , overworked teacher who chooses to do so much and get so little . The movie shows how his class of mostly Latino students from South Central Los Angeles has changed from kids who just wanted to get through to students who hoped to go to college and have a better life . I'm not much of a math student myself but I admire the character's dedication to keeping students on Saturdays and summer breaks , winter breaks , spring breaks , before and after school to help them achieve . Most teachers won't do that despite it all he does it . The outcome is interesting and he is rewarded despite everything . He is a teacher who cares about his students and does everything possible to get them to achieve the unthinkable . We all like stories about the underdog and this is one of him . UNfortunately in real life , this teacher went back to South America and the politics of the school system is the reason that he left . ALl the red tape and politics in the public school system is enough to make you vomit , I know because i am trying to become a licensed and certified secondary education teacher in English .
Not as Bad As It Looked !	Spanglish was a surprise because the commercials on television made it look so unappealing when it has a first rate cast and maybe a second rate script . The stars include Adam Sandler , Tea Leoni , and the always fabulous Cloris Leachman . The characters in this clash of cultures and classes are about the wealthy Los Angelenos who live in the canyon and the mother and daughter immigrants from Mexico . While the wife played by Leoni tries to help the daughter and treats her as almost as if she was her own is resented by her own mother . The Spanish daughter has gone from translator because her mother doesn't speak English enough to being between two worlds where she excels in a private school on scholarship thanks to Leoni's character and befriends their lonely daughter . She becomes one of the family much to the resentment of her own mother who opts out of the environment . I thought this film was a lot better than the commercials I saw for it . Cloris always shines through in her role .
Not Imus ! But still refreshing !	Morning Joe came out of the Don Imus-Rutgers fiasco . After several different co-hosts like Stephanie Miller , Jim Cramer , etc . , Joe Scarborough who was a congressman from Florida turned broadcaster along with his sidekicks such as Mika Brezinski whose father is Zbignew Brezinski worked for the Carter Administration . She also has two brothers-one works for the Obama campaign while the other works for the McCain campaign . I wasn't happy with Mika regarding her treatment of Hillary Clinton during her bid for the democratic nomination . Never mind that Hillary was robbed of the nomination , Mika's eyes always appear to roll when ever she mentioned Hillary's chances with Terry McAuliffe who was head of the Clinton campaign . Willie Geist is the son of Bill Geist , a veteran television broadcaster who got a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame . Regardless of their relations , Willie and Mika are quite refreshing to Morning Joe . They go over headlines in major newspapers like they do in London , England . They have several guest hosts like the late Tim Russert , Tiki Barber , Joe Ridley , Pat Buchanan , etc . They get people with a lot of different opinions . What got me was a couple of weeks ago that Alan Cumming , Tony Award winner and flamboyant homosexual starwith an Obama shirt , was on television and Pat Buchanan was also in the studio . I would have given anything to have Pat interview Alan over Willie and Mika . It would have been a television moment to remember and I would still be laughing about it even now or years from now .
Suddenly Griffin !	It's no wonder that Kathy Griffin has become a star since her days on the show , Suddenly Susan . She was one of the best parts about that show and her relationship between Brooke Shields on screen and off-screen was of great affection . Shields was maid of honor at Griffin's wedding . Now , Kathy is the star of her own reality show on the D-List on Bravo Television . There are moments like her show going to Iraq to entertain the troops with beloved MAD-TV's Michael McDonald along and her former husband . I love watching Kathy on BRavo as herself . She is far more entertaining than most people who have reality television shows . KAthy's pilgrimage to her parents ' ancestral homeland of Ireland was a treat especially to say goodbye to her father who passed away . Kathy is realistic and believable as she hurts , so do we . You can't help but like Kathy even though there are times that she can be annoying .
A charming episode of one of America's best detective programs !	There is no doubt that Columbo's star Peter Falk loves this character . He always takes him out of the closet in a manner of speaking . Peter Falk would be knighted if he was a British actor but since he is an American actor and icon , we'll take him the way he is . I remember watching this episode with Golden Girls ' star Rue McClanahan as the gossip columnist Verity Chandler . Of course , Patrick McGoohan has often been associated with Columbo whether he is directing , writing or starring . There is something addictive about Columbo . He doesn't dumb down the role or the characters . He learns just as well as we do . He is quite the detective . He always gets his man or woman and I just adore Columbo . He is always worth watching . He mixes humor and seriousness with the most serious crime of murder . His job might be murder but it sure is fun watching him get the man or woman to be caught . Even then , you kind of feel sorry for the criminal for his actions . It ' the Columbo touch that you pity the criminal and love the detective .
Short , Sweet , and to the Point !	I bought this because I'm doing Hamlet for my college class in teaching Shakespeare . It's only 30 minutes , brief , and to the point about the basics of Hamlet's story . I think the quality of the animation could have been a lot better which is why I gave it an 8 and it could have been a little more detailed in the storytelling . But if you're looking for something to keep the kids interested , I think this is effective in teaching Hamlet without overburdening them too much . Hamlet can be a difficult subject to teach at any levels . I applaud the animated Shakespeare tales and suggest that they improve their quality and animated figures to the quality of today's technology . There is so much that could have been improved and worthy of doing so . Tilda Swinton has the voice of Ophelia in this tale . So please there is so much that can be done with animation and Shakespeare .
They never gave this show a chance !	Tea Leoni plays Nora Wilde , a serious photographer , who is going through a bad divorce . She wants her freedom but it comes at a cost . She wants to legitimate photography but is hired to work for the tabloids as a paparazzi . Her boss is played by the wonderful and divine Holland Taylor . The show was well-written most of the time . TEa's Nora was beginning to develop into quite a memorable character but the network just didn't support comedy and they still don't . Even when they brought in George Wendt from Cheers , they made unnecessary changes in casting and characters . The show was fine in the beginning and the audience was getting used to it but then the network botches it up like a bad plastic surgery .
An Entertaining if flawed adventure film !	Jon Krakauer's story of climbing Mount Everest earned him his first best seller . Climbing Mount Everest was something that I would have never thought about before until now . It seems exciting even though there have been many casualties of people achieving the difficult climb of almost 40 , 000 feet . This movie has a good cast featuring Christopher McDonald as Jon Krakauer , Peter Horton as team guide Scott Fischer , and Richard Jenkins as Beck Weathers . The story of the climb reminds me of a Perfect Storm . After they reach the summit , they face treacherous weather and casualties mount . It's question of survival , clash of egos , and arrogance as well as motivation and drive to achieve the almost impossible of reaching MOunt Everest and surviving the experience .
Pretty good for a television movie !	I like this movie for some strange reason . I think Peter Horton is believable as a Louisville attorney who goes from corporate to a criminal case with a possible psychopath female serial killer played wonderfully by Carrie Snodgress . I found Horton's character of Steven Keeney to be believable . He grows conscious over a young girl's fallen death and her mother's inquiry regarding her insurance policy opens a can of worms leading to Virginia McGinnis whose primary motive is to collect money on their insurance policies . We begin a journey with Keeney to discover a disturbing psychopath cold-blooded killer capable of the unthinkable . I won't tell you anything more without spoiling the movie . I was impressed with supporting performances by Elizabeth Ruscio as the victim's mother and I enjoyed the rapport between Keeney's secretary Sara West played by Belita Moreno who is now on the George Lopez Show and himself . I found that to be refreshing and memorable too . I am giving this film an 8 because I think it was weak on some parts and could have explored Virginia's personality and background more clearly but I think it is a very high grade for a television film .
An Unforgettable Drama as Tragic and Common as Life today !	Mare Winningham plays the role of a single mother who must struggle without a job and a home with a young child . The film is memorable because she must make the most difficult choice that any parent can make of whether her only child should remain with her on the streets , in rat-infested apartments , in shelters , after friends and family can't help them out anymore . This issue is not new but as old as time itself where parents must struggle to make the most difficult decision of turning her child over to foster care and the state or live on the streets . The final scene is just heartbreaking so have your tissues ready to wipe the tears away .
Clever Twist and Insights of Naomi , Ellen , and Eunice !	In this episode , Mama Harper is in the kitchen making gooseberry jam with her loved ones , not her family , only kidding . Naomi and Ellen are already there but they are awaiting Eunice's arrival with the jars . For each of Naomi , Ellen and Eunice's versions , we get a better sense of how they see each other and themselves around Mother Harper . Mama is making gooseberry jam for a church function . Mama ends up in the hospital and Vint arrives to ask what happened to her . Naomi gives her version of the events in the kitchen . She sees herself as the loving daughter-in-law leaving out Ellen and Eunice . Then Eunice's event shows how she is the loving daughter who comes risking her life to deliver the jars . She sees Ellen with a crown like a Queen and she makes snide remarks to Eunice which we love to watch . Ellen's turn has her as the loving daughter and her mother as somewhat losing it .
Mama gets on Jeopardy !	When Jeopardy recruiters are in Raytown , Iola auditions and misses but Thelma is chosen to be the player from Raytown , the pride of the Tri state region . She gets to play alongside college professors and scholars . While she tries to get the hang of the game , she doesn't seem to be do all so well among the contestants . Unlike Jeopardy itself , she speaks more than she should and suggests that Alex and Iola should hook-up for a date . She also kisses Alex as well . When the episode finally airs even with the final questions , Thelma's final standing in the episode determines her prize . She suggests that she's getting a box of turtle wax or something of the sort . You don't have to be first to get a prize or any prize .
Will it be Naomi or Mama ?	Vinton has just won a dinner for two at the Babylonian Gardens restaurant in Raytown which is one of the town's most popular and expensive restaurants as well . His problem is that it's for Mother's Day and he only has two tickets . Will it be his pregnant wife , Naomi , or his mother , Mama Harper ? He comes up with a solution to solve both their problems but it was nice seeing Vinton get mad while his mother and wife fight for the right to get their free meal . Mother's Day is a big holiday on Mama's Family and always has been . Mama Harper at a Thai restaurant complete with a belly dancer and cushioned seats is quite entertaining . I enjoyed this episode and miss this show . I wished that they aired it again on television . I know it's not the best show that was ever made but it was certainly filled with memorable characters that we don't mind seeing again .
One of My All Time Favorite Episodes Ever !	Mama Harper has lost Vint's most prized possession and best friend , his bowling ball . Anyway Ellen has come over to borrow a family heirloom to wear for her big night at the country club where she has been elected woman of the year . When Mama informs Vint and Naomi that they were invited for the evening , they decide to attend . Mama couldn't be any more humiliating or embarrassing regarding her eldest daughter . She dances with Mayor Tutwiller , drinks beer to Ellen's disgust , and complains that her prime rib was too rare . In the mean-time , Mama is invited to speak a few words and ends up as the Mama Rickles of Raytown with her humor and frankness . Of course , the most fun is watching Ellen be so embarrassed by her family that night .
An Otherwise Perfect Union	Vita Sackville-West and Sir Harold Nicholson were married for more than 50 years and the parents of Benedict and Nigel Nicholson MBE , OBE , who wrote about his parents ' unusual marriage in a very loving way . Both Vita and Harold had homosexual relationships on the side but it was Vita's relationship with childhood friend , Violet Keppel Trefuses who by the way is related to Camilla Parker-Bowles distantly that nearly threatened Vita and Harold's marriage . Marriage is an institution which produced two fine sons . The actress , Janet McTeer , who plays Vita does a superb job and memorable . Violet is played by Cathryn Harrison who I believe is Sir Rex Harrison's daughter or relative . Anyway the acting is sensational and it was quite revolutionary for it's time on television during Masterpiece Theater . Harold and Vita's marriage may have been quite unconventional by it's unusual circumstances but they stayed together . They built Sissinghurst Castle in Kent , England . Vita wrote a beautiful poem about her love for Harold . Now regardless that their union had outside lovers like Violet and Virginia Woolfe . They always returned to each other for comfort , companionship , and conversation . No , this marriage probably wouldn't survive today because there is just too much focus on sex completing a marriage . For those of us who know better , sex does not complete the marriage but enhance it . THe sexual desires of Vita and Harold may have been toward their own sex but they returned to each other every time . A successful marriage is based on being able to turn to the one you love , trust , and need in your most desperate time . Nigel wrote a loving book about his parents ' unconventional marriage but he wrote that they still loved each other and returned to each other from their infidelities every time even with Violet Keppel .
The Best Law & Order of Them All !	One of the reasons that I was turned off by the original Law & Order was because they would spend so little time in the investigation . Now that I know that Dr . Park Dietz inspired this series now I can see why I am drawn to it . The courtroom aspect of the original show was never my favorite part . I was kind of bored by then but this show focuses on the investigation aspect of the crimes therefore being criminal intent . Although it's still Hollywood in the sense of entertainment , they do clever story lines , great casting , and directing with filming on location around the New York City area including New Jersey , Long Island , New York State , and probably Connecticut too . The cast is first rate with Kathryn Erbe , Annabella Sciorra , Alicia Witt , Chris Noth reprises his role as Logan , sometimes seeing former Senator Fred Thompson as Arthur Branch , Courtney B . Vance as the assistant district attorney , and of course Vincent D'Onofrio as the Park Dietz investigator . I have to say that I had all but given up on the franchise until I started watching this show on cable .
Classic British Comedy !	To the Manor Born is about how old money and new money don't necessarily mix very well . The show stars the wonderful Penelope Keith CBE OBE ( a comedy veteran ) who plays Audrey Fforbes Hamilton who represents old money and Peter Bowles as Richard Devere who represents new money . After Audrey's husband and lord of the manor has died much to Audrey's dismay , they didn't have a good marriage . She lets out a scream that she finally free to rule the Manor . Unfortunately , Audrey learns that she is in debt after his death . She must sell her beloved home to Richard Devere , a self-made millionaire entrepreneur who really is both Czech and Polish heritage . She sells but she moves close by and is still active in her community with her best friend played by a terrific actress whose name I can't remember . Daphne Heard plays the wonderful foreign born mother of Richard . The episodes are all classically funny and it is one of Britain's best exports . Penelope Keith is one of Britain's brilliant funny ladies up there with Patricia Routledge CBE OBE and Dame Judi Dench .
Sheer Entertainment !	I remember growing up and watching the Dukes of Hazzard on Friday nights before Dallas and Falcon Crest . The Duke boys were southern rebels . Of course , I grew wishing to be Daisy Duke . I loved Uncle Jesse played by Denver Pyle . I loved Sorrell Brooke in his white clothes . Of course , Enos was lovable . Who could forget his dog ? He was a hush puppy . I remember the auto mechanic who was the friend to the Duke boys . I loved the theme song played I believe by Waylon Jennings , the country star . Who could forget those awesome car chase or the way the Duke boys slid in and out of cars ? They never opened the doors but slid in and out . I always wanted to do that myself . I always thought those Duke boys were the sexiest men on television . They made a cinema film but you can't imagine anybody else playing those roles .
One of the Best Episodes in Recent Memory !	Who would have thought that Neil Patrick Harris would deliver one of the best Saturday Night Live episodes ever ? Well , I didn't . I was watching a taped version of the repeat and he's hysterical . The first skit opens up with a Rachel Maddow show spoof with Governor Blagovich and Ronald Burris . Next , Neil remembers when he was passed over for Fred Savage 20 years ago for hosting . There is the sketch of Broadway actors and actresses in costume worried about the economic state of show business . They should be since tickets can cost a fortune but are worth it for some shows . One of my favorite and most memorable is the Frost / Nixon spoof with Frost played by Harris and his interviews with other seventies icons like Fred " Rerun " Berry , Paul Lynde , Paul Crosby , David Bowie , etc . This sketch still makes me laugh even without seeing the movie . I loved his grilling of the " What's happening ? " episode classic where Rerun and his friends attended the Doobie brothers concert and breaks down , " We couldn't get anybody else . " That was hilarious . I didn't care for the talk show bit but oh who can forget Liza Minnelli in a rare cameo as well . I miss the weekend update segments with a co-host . Meyers is fine but he needs somebody on there regularly .
One of the Show's finest moments !	Vint and Naomi are getting married and moving to Arizona to run a trailer park there . Mama Harper reluctantly gives in to having the wedding at her home . The night before the wedding , the boys ( Vint and his son , Buzz ) go out with brother-in-law , Ed , to the Bigger Jigger for a boys ' night out while the girls stay home . Mama Harper and her sister , old Maid Aunt Fran , are busy setting up for the wedding the next day . The bride to be , Naomi Oates , has come in with cheap wine and stuff from her job at the Food Circus . Ellen ( Betty WHite ) is not too pleased with marriages and weddings . She suspects her husband , Bruce , is having an affair . Unfortunately , she's the last person to know that her husband is having an affair with his secretary . The final scene where there is a showdown between Ellen and her sister , Eunice , is quite unforgettable .
Still one of my favorites Christmas films ! Flaws and all !	I love the Griswolds and have since I first saw their European Vacation film . I later saw the original film . Anyway , this film is great about Clark's ideal Christmas holiday with the family around . The only problem is that nothing ever goes right for him just like his vacations . Anyway , a great cast including Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo as the Griswolds . The kids are played by Juliette Lewis and Johnny Galecki . THe visiting family members are played by Doris Roberts , John Randolph , Diane Ladd , and E . G . Marshall . You can't forget Cousin Eddie played by Randy Quaid and his wife Kathryn played by Miriam Flynn . The film is always a treat around the Holiday season . It reminds us that no family is perfect and problems often arise . As John Randolph's character , Mr . Griswold replies " I had help from Jack Daniels . " Of course , I can't forget Julia Louis-Dreyfus playing the snobby yuppie neighbor . I also liked watching Bill Hickey and Mae Questal as the older family relatives who come on Christmas Eve . It's always worth the laughs .
Behind the Making of History !	In this mini-documentary that accompanied the DVD versions , we meet the inspiration for Don Cheadle's Oscar nominated performance as Paul , the Rwandan Hutu , who saves over a thousand refugees during the Rwandan genocide in 1994 . I thought it was ironic that the genocide came upon the heels of Spielberg's Schindler's List winning Best Picture . Anyway , the Belfast born director does provide an insight into the story behind the movie as does the screenwriter who discovers a survivor by calling the Rwandan Embassy in Washington D . C . and listening to her story . The story itself is worth seeing and telling because Paul was truly heroic by risking his life to save others at the posh Belgian-owned hotel . Too bad , we didn't see the other actors and actresses in the cast like Nick Nolte , Joaquin Phoenix , and Sophie ( who played his wife ) .
Brilliant , Suspenseful , and Unforgettable !	First , I saw this film in Venice , Italy last August but I didn't see all of it . We went sightseeing . Finally last night , it emerged on late night television and I made a point to watch it . The two actresses who play Beth and Diana are brilliant in their performances . Their characters are far more alike than different . Beth is a struggling single mother of a wheelchair bound son , Benji , who she loves more than anything . She is having a rough day would be an understatement . Nothing appears to go right . Benji's father bought a house an hour away and wants to file for custody of him with his wife . Beth loses her job as a result of incompetence or lack of compassion . She doesn't have enough money in her bank account to buy her son a telescope so she pawns her necklace . She gets into a road rage incident which is equally her fault but then nobody appears to stop her . Diana is a married mother of two children with another on the way . She is equally having a bad day . Her husband is unemployed and they are on the verge of losing their home . Her son was caught bringing a gun to an expensive prep school and was expelled . Her daughter's needs are never quite answered . She needs a promotion to save her family and she needs to reassure her status in the business world . I didn't like the ending . The plot was suspenseful and kept moving along but I won't spoil it for others . You have to see it to believe it .
A Superior Animated Film !	Okay , Pixar and animation has a lot more going for it . Besides only needing human voices to make animated movies and television series , the top and first class animated figures are done by computers now than hand-done but it takes a village to make a great animated film . The Incredibles is about a superhero couple who retire to have a normal life as they can . Of course , Craig T . Nelson is wonderful and recognizable as the voice of the father and superhero who can't give up his former profession . His wife is the voice of norm here who wants a normal life for their family . I could see why this film and others have attracted audiences whether young and old , parents , grandparents , and children . Most audiences can relate to the situation and enjoy the Disney film and appreciate how technology has come along way .
I only wish there was more of it !	I liked this film version of the television show because it makes me laugh on a rainy day or when I am having a bad day . The casting is excellent . I feel that Jim Varney plays an excellent Jed Clampett . I wish there was a sequel when he was still alive . Sadly , he's gone . I think we saw him apart from his Ernest character a lot more in Jed . He seem to feel right at home in this character . Cloris Leachman is a hoot as Granny and I really felt that she enjoyed the role . Erika Leniak does an actually good job as Elly May Clampett . She seems to fit at right home with the role . I liked Diedrich Bader as both Jethro and his twin sister Jethrine . Bader is really an excellent comedic actor . I thought Lily Tomlin played Ms . Jane Hathaway in her own updated style . I felt this Jane had more gusto than Nancy Culp did in the series . Dabney Coleman is always fun to see and in this one as Drysdale . I liked him and Tomlin together . I liked Penny Fuller as Mrs . Drysdale and Kevin O'Connell who plays their son , Morgan . I felt Morgan and Elly could have gotten together . I liked Linda Carlson as Jethro's mother . I wished she was on more . Rob Schneider and Lea Thompson really do a good job as con-artists after the Clampetts . But I really enjoyed watching this film to see the stars like Zsa Zsa Gabor , Miguel Ferrer , Buddy Ebsen as Rockford , Dolly Parton , etc . Their cameos made it worth while to see them . It's nice to see Zsa Zsa poke fun at herself on screen in anything .
Interesting Look into the Future !	Joely Richardson had to leave the show for family reasons . Her daughter Daisy was having surgery so she had to be with her in London . Anyway , the show's producer who I think is wonderful because he planned the season to accommodate her . The episode is powerful with Dylan Walsh giving his finest performance yet this season as Sean McNamara . Of course , the season is not finished yet . A few more episodes to go and then we will inherit Dirt for the spring season . Anyway the episode takes place 20 years into the future , Sean and Julia have split up and divorced again . Annie is a complete wreck and brother Matthew is now a surgeon . Christian is in a polygamous marriage but gays and lesbians cannot get married . Liz is nowhere in this episode . I guess she doesn't make it to 2026 . The episode has a hurricane named Lenore devastating Florida as Julia takes Conor and Annie to New York to visit Grandma . We have not seen the wonderful Vanessa Redgrave this season . Anyway , the future looks bright literally and bloodless procedures are the norm . Conor grows up to be a beautiful man . It's nice that Marlowe met and married a woman named Sally and they have a son , Zach , who is star baseball player .
He's Back !	I never watched the premiere episode but I think I'm going to watch it on DVD of Nip / Tuck . Anyway , Escobar Gallardo played wonderfully by Robert Lasardo should get a best supporting actor in a drama Emmy nomination for his appearances . He's always well worth watching . I think Ryan Murphy hates not having him around . Well finally he is in prison and so is mutual friend of Troy / McNamara who he marries in a prison ceremony . When Merril returns to the office for a procedure after being in prison and being abused by the other inmates , the look on Troy's face when he realizes who Merril's been serving is quite unforgettable . Anyway , Merril is sent by his husband to get the services of Troy and Sean to fix his face because it was lit on fire . Galardo knows how to play Sean and Christian as always and gets what he wants and they get to keep a secret that could destroy their business . Poor Merril , I don't think we'll see him again anytime soon .
Not one of the Master Hitchcock's Best but not the worst either !	Watching Frenzy from Sir Alfred Hitchcock is quite fascinating . The cast features the great Billie Whitelaw C . B . E . , Clive Swift ( Keeping Up Appearances ) , Jean Marsh ( who should be awarded Damehood by now ) , the unforgettable Vivian Merchant in a great small role as the cop's wife who likes to cook French cuisine . Of course , Anna Massey who plays one of the victims . In the murder sequence featuring Barbara Leigh Hunt ( another British actress worthy of a British honor and is one of Dame Judi Dench's very best friends and the godmother to her only child ) was difficult but yet unbelievable to watch . Just when you think he might let her live , you are wrong . She is the first murder victim and the whole rape and murder is shown explicitly . We know who the killer is all along but we don't know how they are going to catch in the act . The murder of Anna Massey was done differently because once they entered his character's apartment . The door becomes closed to us as the spectator . We don't know how bad it is until later . So watching how the murderer escapes from this one is quite unforgettable . You think he'll get caught and the movie is worth watching because of the London locations alone .
Excellent Film about Contemporary Family Relations !	Savages was written and directed by Tamara Jenkins . Oscar nominee Laura Linney and Oscar Winner Philip Seymour Hoffman play estranged siblings , Wendy and John . She is an aspiring playwright in New York City and he's an aspiring author / literature professor in Buffalo , New York . The chemistry is perfect between them two as siblings with messed-up lives . They are called when their ill father played beautifully by Philip Bosco needs them the most at the end of his life . There are questions about dementia and his health after an unfortunate incident with his girlfriend at her home in Sun City , Arizona . Wendy wants better for him but is forced to confront reality . John is the realistic of the two siblings . Both are childless except for their literary contributions and for Wendy's cat , Genghis , and dog , Marley as they both approach middle ages . I barely recognized Debra Monk but enjoyed seeing Nancy Lenehan and Margo Martindale who are always a treat as character actresses in their roles .
It's a likable show !	As Time Goes By is actually a mediocre show . Sometimes , I can't believe the stories including when Dame Judi Dench's character , Jean , informs her sister-in-law played by the wonderful Moyra Fraser about Lionel being a psychiatrist . There are lots of wonderful moments in this show about their reunion and relationship . The casting of Joan Sims ( who was never awarded Damehood herself should be considered a crime ) and Frank Middlemass added an interesting touch that you're never too old to fall in love . I thought Joan Sims was simply wonderful and did not know about her until this role as Madge , Rocky's wife . She died before the series ended in 2001 and her death was written into the show . Geoffrey Palmer should get the O . B . E . ( Officer of the British Empire ) for his services to television comedy which he did in the 2005 Queen's New Year's Honours List for his services to drama . That award is long overdue . After all , Dame Judi Dench is one of Britain's most beloved actresses and acting treasures . If the show ended with him reading his letter to her , it would have been perfect . In fact , they came back and were stronger than ever .
Still worth watching again and again !	I too remember seeing this film in the movie theater with my dad and sister . The film is typical John Hughes fare . It's about a 16 year old girl played of course by Molly Ringwald . She does a superb job as the girl who is never really embraced in the high school life . She is rather treated more like an outcast than actually accepted . She is part of the crowd but not as popular as her sister Ginny played by Blanche Baker . She is lone and forgotten on her sixteenth birthday . Her family is too busy dealing with the wedding of her older sister , Ginny , and out of town relations crashing for the weekend . What a cast too , you have Carlin Glynn playing Mom Baker and Paul Dooley playing Dad Baker . Justin Henry plays her annoying younger brother , Mike . The in-laws are played by Billie Bird and Carole Cook . The laughs just roll in too . Liane Baker plays Sam's best friend . Anthony Michael Hall plays the Geek . Havilland Taylor plays the girl of every boy's dreams , and Michael Schoeffling plays the beautiful Jake . Anyway , the writing is pretty good , the cast is excellent , and the scenes are unforgettable . Also John Kapelos plays the hunky groom and Zelda Rubenstein plays the pianist . ALl in all , it's a great film with a happy , unrealistic ending .
Stellar Cast , Crew , and Writing !	Yes , Minister explained the intricacies about life as a member of parliament . Paul Eddington CBE ( The Good Life ) is the minister of parliament elected by his district or constituency . His new adviser is played by the brilliant Sir Nigel Hawthorne and Derek Fowlds is also brilliant in his role . The cast and crew did a remarkable job in trying to entertain and yet inform it's audiences all about the politics in their government at the Parliament . Much like a good situation comedy , the show is smart and funny without talking down to the audience . This show explains the importance of voting and taking part in elections . Tim Russert probably loved this show since he loved politics and we miss him so much . It's still a show worth watching for kids and adults . Maybe kids in Briton could enjoy and understand the policies of their own government by watching this show and appreciate their member of parliament more .
Twelve Episodes isn't enough !	Fawlty Towers sadly should have been more than 12 episodes or two seasons by British standards . John Cleese who turned down an C . B . E . ( Commander of the Order of the British Empire ) in 1996 should have been knighted but if he refused the C . B . E . then why bother but he is a comedic genius and brilliant intellectually . Sadly , he and his partner , his then wife American playing British woman , Connie Booth was also a major part . SHe played the only sane person among a sea of lunatics . Basil Fawlty is one of the most memorable characters in British television history . Who can forget the German episode or the wedding episode where the unmarried couple believe he is fooling around with Manuel played perfectly by Andrew Sachs . Prunella Scales C . B . E . is quite the opposite of her actual personality . I still love her and think she should become a Dame soon by now . Her performance as Sybil Fawlty is etched in stone . The cast including the older two women who are probably a lesbian couple which was never talked about on the show broke barriers even though they played it straight and Ballard Berkeley's performance as the Major in the moose episode is unforgettable . Twelve episodes is not enough . It should have ran for a 100 .
A Dame is Announced !	Dame Geraldine McEwan ( since she refused becoming a dame in 2002 and an O . B . E . or Officer of the British Empire in 1986 ) , I am going to call her that anyway . Geraldine is a finely trained actress and her role as the new Jane Marple of the new century is a welcome delight . This is a first rate production with stunning visuals of post World War II country life . She is on vacation at a spa and visits her friend's lesbian daughter , Amy , and her partner , Lizzie . Jane probably knows about them from Lizzie's masculine attire . In the first part , they hold hands but not much more . They are discrete in uncertain . Of course , watching the rest of the cast is delightful with Zoe Wanamaker C . B . E . as the prime target who survives being shot and her sister played by the wonderful Elaine Page who mostly does musicals with her excellent singing voice . Like in the previous Miss Marples , I remember her saying " Murder is never simple1 ! " I am excited to see Geraldine McEwan . I am sure Dame Agatha Christie is smiling down upon her with approval . I am sure that the previous actresses like Dame Margaret Rutherford and Joan Hickson are delighted to see an interest in Miss Marple Mysteries . Oh , I can't forget the music .
Mama Goes Dirty Dancing !	When Vint and Naomi sign up to go Dirty Dancing , Mama , Bubba , and Iola tag along to the dance contest . There Mama Harper reunites with a man who is now a widower . It turns out that Thelma and Carl and him and his late wife used to go dancing all the time . In this episode with the popularity of the film , Dirty Dancing , at the time of this episode , Thelma and the widower sign up for the contest while Iola and Bubba sign up too . When it comes down to the final round of the contest , it turns out that Mama and her dance partner are in the running for first place against Vint and Naomi . You have to watch and see who is the best dancing couple of dirty dancing in Raytown if possible .
Classic Christmas Film !	Chris Van Allsburg best selling children's book is considered by many to be classic children's literature . The film version is an animated which benefits the story further . Tom Hanks plays the narrator , producer , and the train conductor . The animation is first rate , award winning , and breathtakingly realistic as well . Of course , this is a children's story and there are some dark moments like the girl who didn't have her ticket and the main character who found it and planned to return it to her so she doesn't get kicked off the train and the ending . Of course , I am surprised that there was negative criticism . If I had children , I would love a classic film like this about the true meaning of Christmas . The act of being the giver and the receiver is what the story is about . Let's not talk about the nativity , that's for another story . If It's good enough for Chris Van Allsburg , it's good enough for me .
Married or Not ? Just Imagine !	In this episode with Joseph Campanella as the teacher and Amy Benedict as Bubba's girlfriend , the family imagines what life would be like if Mama married her teacher . Just think of the film Rebecca to give you an idea . Iola imagines herself married to Vint . In that scenario , Iola and Naomi switch roles completely . Then Bubba imagines being married to Amy , she is very pregnant , Grandmother Harper is impossible , and there are babies while Bubba is working 3 jobs to support his growing family . It's a great episode and one of my favorites . I thought Amy Benedict is great as Bubba's girlfriend , Amy Johnson , while Joseph Campanella is brilliant and underused as Mr . Hanson in this episode .
Everything is brilliant and almost perfect !	Watching Prime Suspect again makes me realize and appreciate every episode . Dame Helen Mirren is always worth watching whether Prime Suspect or anything else . Her role of Jane Tennison will go down in history as one of the best female roles ever written and acted by this wonderful dame . The writing is superior to anything else on television . More than ten years after its first showing in America , Prime Suspect is classic television . The series itself has also some award winning performances by Zoe Wanamaker as the unsuspecting wife of a serial killer . Even though we suspect it , it is fascinating to unravel the mystery . When we see the female corpses , it is a gruesome look into reality . For us , it is entertainment . In the real world , they are somebody's daughter and the killer is inhuman . When we finally solve the mystery in this addition , we will have more questions and answers . The biggest question is why does this happen to begin with .
It answered so many questions about 1900	I really can't recommend this documentary and experiment enough . It is really entertaining and brilliantly done to help us understand life in 1900 . I found the Bowlers as a challenging adventurous family who was willing to undertake this difficult project . Mrs . Bowler is a remarkable woman who was wonderful . Her twin daughters passed time by creating a little theatre in their home . What she missed surprised me the most ? They did not complain about the television , radio , telephone , or computer , almost necessary essentials in our times . Life was tough in Victorian times by their experience . I can't thank them enough for their efforts of three months as a Victorian family .
Almost Perfect !	Okay , maybe it should have won the Academy Award for Best Picture instead of Ghandhi . It had a great storyline of a young boy Elliot , played by Henry Thomas , who bonds with an alien named E . T . for Extra Terrestial . Of course , people like Peter Coyote is soon out to capture the alien from Elliott's home . His mother , Dee Wallace , is perfectly cast as the divorced mother of three who is unsuspecting of the creature in her home . As a nine year old when this film came out , I was envious the actors who played Elliott and Gertie played none other by Drew Barrymore , a descendant of American acting royalty . The film is a classic family film which should brings families together . I don't think it's my favorite Spielberg film of all time . that would be Jaws . I could watch that film a hundred times and still go in the water but E . T . is a tear-jerker and you might want to keep your Kleenex in reaching distance when you watch this film . I will always treasure the memory of my father who took me and my sister to see this film at the cinema .
You get goosebumps !	I remember my first film with Katharine Hepburn . I saw her in Ernest Thompson's " The Golden Pond " which won her fourth Academy Award with Henry Fonda and his daughter Jane Fonda . I believed for a long time that she was Henry's wife and Jane's mother in real life . That was how good she was . I didn't know much about her personal life or her secret longtime affair with Spencer Tracy . Watching this documentary following the Philadelphia Story is a treat . It recaptures her life and legacy . She will be best remembered as one of America's most treasured actresses on film , television or stage . Yet , she didn't have an ounce of vanity . When she talks about Arzner or those lesbian rumors , she jokes them off when it could have destroyed her career . She talks about her only marriage , her New York City townhouse which I used to visit across from my doctor's office . Sadly in 1997 , I believe she was living full time in her beloved Connecticut home but yet she still managed to live an amazing life . She manages to garden , bike , and be quite active . She is an inspiration for us all .
An excellent performance by Ruth White !	I bought this tape because Ruth White was a Perth Amboy gal who died before my own birth . Ruth plays the role of Helen exquisitely . Ruth White died before her time in my opinion . Had she had lived longer ? She would have done so much more on stage , film , and television . Ruth is the heart and soul of this theatrical production . Too bad , New York Television Theater does not exist anymore because it records historical performances by award winning actresses like Ruth White . She makes Helen to be likable , alive , and even lovable . She learns to bond with the caged dolphin over the span of a few days . Back in 1969 , the labs killed the animals once they were finished in the laboratory . The dolphin is poorly constructed and outdated to our contemporary times . But you have to take it with understanding , Ruth White reminds me of an Irish American Judi Dench . I am glad that she came from Perth Amboy and she had returned home to die . She gives a remarkable subtle performance with ever ounce of dedication . Oh if Ruth had lived longer , she would have been awarded . But since she died the same year as the tape quite suddenly from cancer , we have these recorded performances to always remember actresses like Ruth White . Rest in peace , Ruth .
They left an impression on me that I can't get rid of !	I love Kath and Kim . I only saw a few episodes of this show on a British Airways flight in 2003 and I hope and pray that it will come out on DVD or be shown in the New York City area . I think Britcom fans would get a kick out of this show . I know I did . I think the writing and acting both out of this world or just down under . I still think about the show and look for it on the internet . So please public stations , use those dollars to purchase the rights to bring this show to American audiences . I think they will get a kick out of it like I did . I think it's one of the best Australian shows around . The actresses who play Kath and Kim really remind me Absolutely Fabulous with a bit more sense to their rhythm . Kath and Kim are a mother and daughter . The daughter prefers to sleep ( not around ) and has no motivation while the mother has enough for her and everybody else around the house .
A Great Show !	There are few shows that have such a talented cast . Beginning with Burt Reynolds , Charles Durning , Ossie Davis , Hal Holbrook , Marilu Henner , Michael Jeter , Elizabeth Ashley , etc . The show was aimed for success . It lasted for at least one hundred episodes . Maybe Burt's high profile divorce from Loni Anderson did not help matters much . Anyway , the show was well-written by President Clinton's friends , the Thomasons . That couple proved that southern humor can be mainstream to a wide audience from the city to the smallest of towns . Evening Shade was the kind of place that you yearned to call home . People were friendly and cordial with one another . They may have had their problems but they always managed to get along . Burt played a coach and Marilu was his wife . Holbrook was his father-in-law . Evening Shade was the kind of town that people who were born there lived for their entire lives .
Still a classic film !	First , Jeremy Irons ( when will he get Knighted by the Queen for his services ? ) is brilliant as Claus Von Bulow , a chilly , complicated , man to begin with and even likable portrayed by Irons . Von Bulow is suspected of putting his wife , Sunny , into a coma at their Newport cottage which is an enormous estate in Rhode Island . Sunny is portrayed beautifully and wonderfully by Glenn Close , she deserved to have been nominated for Best Actress in this role . Both Close and Irons are truly believable as a couple who fall in love together . Unfortunately , Sunny was born into her wealth and never had much interest in anything other than going to bed all day . Not that she had a sexual problem , her husband sought out sexual contact with call girls before turning his attention to a soap opera actress , Alexandra Iles portrayed by the under-rated Julie Hagerty . They didn't show much of her or their relationship . As far as Sunny regarded , it was nothing more than sexual . Sunny's problems were consumed by her hypoglycemia , smoking 3 packs of cigarettes a day , and her pills . If you watch this film , Alan Dershowitz is played well by Ron Silver . His supporting team of young lawyers include actors such as Felicity Huffman , Annabella Sciorra , and Ian Lithgow . As the film proceeds , Fisher Stevens plays a minor but a pivotal role in this film . The flashbacks allow us to see the couple mostly in bed discussing or arguing about CLaus wanting a job to have some purpose in life . Poor Sunny , she never seemed to have a purpose in life but being wealthy . She never had any hobbies , friends , or anything to do but smoke and take her pills . She was slowly killing herself even though Claus says " Nobody shakes Sunny . " I also forgot to mention the role of Maria played perfectly by the legendary actress Uta Hagen . This casting was perfect not to mention Claus ' girlfriend played Christine Baranski . I loved the flashback scene where Claus and Sunny are playing with a tiger . Close is beautiful in that scene . The costumers and make-up artists did a fantastic job in allowing Sunny and Claus to grow old . When you finish watching this film , you could argue all you want but you can make your own conclusions about what happened .
Great Family movie for people of all religions !	Will Ferrell is a comic genius . Only somebody with his talent could develop naive Buddy the human elf into a great family film . The film is done with a lot of heart and sometimes is even corny but it is a great family film . There is rarely expletives or violence in the film . Will steals this film easily from stars like James Caan , Mary Steenburgen , Ed Asner , and Bob Newhart . If you're looking for a good holiday movie without any preaching , this is it . I wish Artie Lange was doing more acting like this than the Howard Stern show . He is an untapped comic genius in his own right . Artie Lange is the John Belushi of our generation and sadly he has some of the same problems . Will Ferrell is worthy of the success . He is brilliant , likable as Buddy . How can you not love him after seeing him in this film ? If you're a fan of SNL , you will know why there are volumes of his best work . He is simply incredible comedic genius and we love him at our house .
They don't make enough them to satisfy me !	Let's face it , we are all trying to make money in these tough times or invest it in antiques . In this series , the appraisers travel around the country to appraise various items . There are always interesting items that pop up at the road shows . There are thousands of willing guests praying that they hold a treasure among their prized possessions . One guy brought Gale Sayers football jersey with marks and all that his wife was going to throw out . The appraiser valued it at 20 , 000-30 , 000 easily . The jersey was priceless anyway because of the history during his season . Of course , some people like myself look around for my most valuable piece whether it's furniture or a book . One lady retrieved a book from the garbage which was an actual screenplay to an early film with autographs from the director , writer , and major cast members . She saved it from near destruction . Now , not everything is going to be valuable unless you pay a lot of money or go treasure hunting . I think this hobby is better suited for adults . Check around to see if you have a valuable painting etc . that could pay the bills or if not . Keep looking , and watch and learn from the show itself .
The Timing of the Actual Genocide could not be anymore poignant !	In 1994 , Steven Spielberg and the film , Schindler's List , won countless awards and honors for it's subject on the Holocaust and how one German businessman , Oskar Schindler , caught in the struggle helped save over a thousand lives . Like Paul in Hotel Rwanda , Oskar was a businessman who was seeking opportunity in Cracow . Just like Paul , Oskar saved a thousand lives from the gas chambers and concentration camps . While Rwanda is nowhere near Eastern Europe and is located in Africa , we know very little about Rwanda . In 1994 , the Rwandan president was murdered leaving two ethnic groups , the Hutus , and the Tutsis as enemies again . The order was removed . The Hutus were incited by hatred , lies , propaganda , and direction from their leader to kill those " cockroaches " known as the Tutsis . By the end of the genocide , almost a million Tutsis were murdered . Paul is a hotel manager for a Belgium company , Sabena , who is put in charge . His wife is a Tutsi and he is a Hutu . The hotel has guests played by Nick Nolte who is a Canadian UN Peacekeeper unable to do anything because of red tape and Joaquin Phoenix is a cameraman for a news organization who risks his life to videotape the slaughter on the streets . For those sheltered at the Hotel , Paul maintains that it will be a safe place whether there is enough food , water , or supplies . Paul must bargain with the general who does not believe that he will be found guilty of war crimes against the Tutsis . The horrors of this genocide is not brutal because we don't see much blood but we see bodies lying on lawns and the brainwashed killers with machetes . Paul played by Don Cheadle definitely earned his Academy Award nomination as did Sophie Okeondo who was nominated . I wished it was nominated for best film of the year . Unfortunately , the western nations took their slow time in stopping the genocide . Rwanda does not have oil but coffee and tea . This story is about 1268 refugees who survived the genocide in 1994 .
We just love Tony's spirit !	Is it true that his show is getting canceled ? I hope not . I think it's kind of sad if you think about it . When is cancellation ever a good idea especially about a guy like Tony who appeals to an audience from all walks of life . Tony comes across as a nice guy and a pleasure to be around . I never heard anything bad about his days on the " Who's the Boss ? set " and I don't think I ever will . I remember Katherine Helmond who became his closest friend who visited him on the set for one of his first episodes . They talked about their days together and how Tony cooked for the cast and crew . How they stopped fowl language around their younger co-stars ( Danny Pintauro and Alyssa Milano ) ? Tony appears to treat everybody the same way . I think he was upset with the changes on his show which is his show . The network and bosses should leave Tony alone and do his job rather than firing others around him . Anyway , I wished Tony well and much success .
Legendary Documentary !	PBS's Frontline has been a source of both information and enlightenment . It's one of the shows that is sorely not advertised enough because it's on public television . They show an unbiased , objective point of view regarding any issue , situation , or circumstances . One of the episodes is about climbing Mount Everest in May 1996 where several experienced climbers died after reaching the summit , a rare accomplishment for anybody . In fact , watching the documentary makes me want to climb it even though I would never get past first camp where you have to spend 3 weeks to get accumulated to the thin air . Everybody in the documentary regarding the climb on Mount Everest comes across as real and authentic . For those of us who would never make it to Everest , this documentary allows us to experience through the people's voices and memories that come alive in their re-telling almost better than any film version .
Monroe , Lemmon , and Tony Curtis ! What more could you ask for ?	I haven't seen this film until this past weekend . I know it has been highly rated as an all time classic comedy and I can see why . I love Tony CUrtis and Jack Lemmon as two male band players forced to dress up as women in order to get out of CHicago after the Valentine's Day massacre in 1929 . Tony Curtis deserves a lot of credit for playing the male suitor to Marilyn Monroe's Sugar . Even though Jack Lemmon is hysterical as Daphne , you can't forget how giddy and happy he is when he finds love with a male suitor played wonderfully by Joe E . Brown . I forget who plays the female conductor but she's also wonderful in the film . It's sad that Marilyn Monroe died so young only three years after making this wonderful classic film . She and Tony Curtis appear made for each other in this film . Jack Lemmon was well deserved of his Oscar nomination but I can't imagine why they left out Tony Curtis . Billy Wilder chose wisely to film it in black and white . I love the train ride scenes and once they are down in Florida . I love and miss both Jack Lemmon and Marilyn Monroe . I wish Tony Curtis would talk about it on the Actors Studio since he is still very much alive and well .
Brilliant Performance by American legend !	Geraldine Page won an Academy Award as Best Actress for her role in the Horton Foote drama , " A Trip To Bountiful , " about a widowed woman living with her son and his wife played memorably by Carlin Glynn in Texas . She yearns for one last trip back to Bountiful which is a dying town . She meets Rebecca DeMornay , a fellow traveler , and they bond . The most interesting scenes are when she tries to escape her son's apartment and go to the bus station . All she wants is one trip to Bountiful before she dies . When she gets there , it's more of a ghost town or cemetery than a town itself . She has to convince others of her quest for one last trip to Bountiful before she goes .
It was one of the best shows then and now !	Murphy Brown's intelligence and comedic wit is pure genius and fun to watch . Lifetime began airing the repeats for a while until 2000 which is a shame because it is such a high quality , well-written , and extremely well-acted show overall . While Candice Bergen plays the title character , she never uses her status to ruin the show . She allows her excellent supporting cast including Faith Ford , Grant Shaud , Jim Regalbuto , and the guy who plays Jim Dial . When Grant Shaud left the show , the show brought Lily Tomlin who did an excellent job . I loved Garry Marshall and Pat Corbett as Phil , the local bar owner and the guy that knew everything in Washington D . C . There are several hilarious episodes with guest stars like Barry Manilow serenading Baby Avery , the wonderful Colleen Dewhurst as the memorable Avery Brown , Murphy's mom , Darren McGavin as her father , Broadway Legend Marian Seldes as her aunt during a fabulous Christmas episode . I am sad that Robert Pastorelli passed away recently but he was memorable as the house painter / artist and nanny for Avery . Somebody told me that guest stars shaked the cast for making their experience to be the most pleasurable during their stay . Murphy Brown lasted 11 years for several reasons - - it's great cast and staff of writers like Diane English .
Too Good for Television !	We could still use Black Adder even today . Imagine Rowan Atkinson resuming the role of assistant to the prime minister played by the wonderful Hugh Laurie . Hugh is sensational as the dimwit Prince George and Edmund as his brilliant assistant . I love the episode which Kenneth Connor guest stars as a British thespian . Every time , Edmund says Macbeth . The two thespians do a silly little act to ward off evil spirits . It's the funniest things that you will see . Of course , none of this brilliance and comedic genius could be without Ben Elton and Richard Curtis who are also behind the films like Love Actually , The Thin Blue Line , Four Weddings and A Funeral . Black Adder is funny and almost too good for television . Humor can be smart , sexy , and funny all at one . I was hoping last night on Saturday Night Live that Hugh Laurie would pay homage to his background in British humor . If the gang at SNL did some research , they would know what a treasure it was to have Hugh Laurie grace their stage .
Best Cop Show Ever !	I still miss a show like this drama . It had a first cast , crew , and writing that no other show on television had until that point . Andre Braugher ( I love you ) , Kyle Secor , Melissa Leo , David Belzer , Ned Beatty , Isabell Hoffman , Stephen Baldwin , etc . I only wished that they didn't get rid of Leo's character , Kay Howard , who I think was the best female heterosexual cop on television up there with Cagney and Lacey . I like the real life and on screen relationship between Hoffman and Baldwin . Let's put it to you this way , when they did the reunion film , everybody in the cast and crew reunited which is amazing because this cast and crew worked so well together that they formed relationships that would last a lifetime . Braugher's Emmy winning performance as Frank Pendleton is amazing and unforgettable . The show shot much of it on location in Baltimore itself and that city became part of the show's unique character .
My Favorite Spielberg Film of All Time	I love Jaws and I still go in the ocean even though I've seen this movie about a hundred times . I love watching JAWs . It's probably Spielberg's best film to date , sorry Schindler's List , E . T . , and Saving Private Ryan . This movie does not leave you with any bad feelings . The movie is first entertaining from beginning to end and it is well-done . I love Roy Scheider in his role as the water phobic police chief , Lorraine Gary as his wife , Murray Hamilton who I always mistake for Hal Holbrook as the Mayor of Amity , Robert Shaw as the shark hunter , and Richard Dreyfuss as the shark expert . Anyway , there are great moments in the film like when Chief Brody catches his young son imitating him at the dining room table and asks him for kiss and Mrs . Brody watching with a cup in hand . It's those moments of pure magic that make you want to watch over and over again .
If you loved the first , you'll fall madly in love with II !	The First Black Adder series was basically set during the Black Plague years . The second season of this series has Edmund Black Adder as the Lord in Queen Elizabeth I's court during the Elizabethan era . The Black Adder comes in different eras of British history . What a historic way to look at life during different times in British history . I love Miranda Richardson as Queen Elizabeth I . She is at her best and having the time of her life . Of course , you can't forget Tony Robinson as Baldrick , the goof and servant to the Lord Black Adder . Anyway as the series grew , the shows got better and better . I can't imagine anybody else playing Queen Elizabeth I better than Miranda Richardson . MAybe it's because she incites a dark sense of humor and fun to the otherwise virginal character . Sorry Dame Judi Dench , Dame Helen Mirren , Cate Blanchett , Bette Davis , Miranda's performance here as Queen Elizabeth I will always my personal favorite . I loved Patsy Byrne in her role as the Queen's nurse . Of course , you can't forget Brian Blessed and others .
Dirty Dancing Coming to Broadway for it's 20th anniversary !	There was talk on the E ! Hollywood Special about the Making of Dirty Dancing which still is considered by many women including a dear friend of mine in her fifties to be one of her favorite all time movies . Maybe the music , the dancing , or the melodrama around the plot of Baby Frances becoming a dancing sensation with Johnny Castle . Of course , this film established Jennifer Grey whose biggest role to date was the resentful sister in Ferris Beuller's Day Off . Patrick Swayze is perfectly cast as the heart throb leading man who sweeps baby away literally . Dirty Dancing has it all to become a Broadway or West End smash hit . It has the love story , the music , and most of all lots of dancing . Jennifer and Patrick could revive their roles easily . it is nice to see Jerry Orbach play a doctor instead of a police officer and Kelly Bishop as the mother . It all took place in the Catskills in the sixties where many Jewish families vacationed in the area during their summer vacations . At the end of the film , it is sad to see the hotel owner , Kellerman , be baffled by the next generation . It happened anyway ! Most people prefer cruises and traveling through Europe than spending the summer in the Catskills . Those old grand hotels are becoming Indian gaming casinos . Let Broadway bring Dirty Dancing alive and well . After all , they could do it for Footloose and Saturday Night Fever , this should be a no brainer ! I know that this film is one of the favorites that you don't get tired of after watching 800 times . There are people that have probably seen this film-a 1 , 000 times by now . Somehow watching the making and the story behind Dirty Dancing made me long for my childhood days as a thirteen year old . Dirty Dancing may not be the greatest film ever made in the history but its universal appeal still draws crowds and repeated watchers like the 800 club whose members have watched it so many times . I watch it fondly now with all the awkwardness of Baby's first days and her first true love with Patrick Swayze as heart throb , Johnny Castle . Nobody could have imagined this little film as a big hit then with the sixties music , two soundtracks , and even a tour in the late eighties . I hope they bring it to Broadway in a musical . It would work for the audience to be part of a film . No wonder it still attracts kids and even adults particularly women of all ages to watch it over and over again . Well , Australia and London both have had productions of Dirty Dancing . It looks like it will come to Broadway in 2007 just in time for it's 20th anniversary .
