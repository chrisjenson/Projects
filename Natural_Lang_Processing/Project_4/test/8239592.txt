Bad " gas " runs out of wit early , emits noxious fumes throughout and stalls with its crummy plot , annoying characters and chaotic narrative	A simply atrocious and excruciatingly unfunny would-be frenzied over-the-top comedy done in a horrendously ham-fisted wannabe Robert Altmanesque multi-storied ensemble cast fashion . It's about the crazed pandemonium which besets a quiet , peaceful small town when the populace gets wind of an artificially created gas shortage . Director Les Rose pitches all the noisy , anarchic , off-the-wall facetious mayhem at a loud , overbearing , gratingly strident level of high-flown hysteria , staging a never-ending series of shrill mondo destructo slapstick gags with an appalling lack of skill and crack comic timing . Worse yet , Richard Wolf's sloppy , idiotic , severely witless and desperate script resorts to such cheap , groan-producing tactics as crude racial stereotypes , leering sex jokes , dumb double entendre dialogue and constant out-of-control car chases in its strained attempts at milking laughs from a basically unamusing premise , inevitably culminating in the expected last reel grand scale car chase and subsequent multiple automobile crash up which proves to be both painfully protracted and very irritating in comparable measure . Moreover , there's no insight offered herein to provide any necessary illumination on why folks would act so wretchedly in the midst of such a crisis and the allegedly pointed satire remains blunt and obvious throughout . Perhaps the film's most heinous cinematic sin is its dismal misuse of an excellent big name cast , all of whom portray broadly drawn , one-note , disgustingly grotesque caricatures and mug it up to an unbearable degree in a dire effort to inject some much-needed life into the flimsy goings-on : Sterling Hayden in one of his patented fanatical roles as the greedy , ruthless oil tycoon who secretly hordes petrol in order to jack up gas prices and make himself a bundle , Susan Anspach as a bitchy , opportunistic TV reporter who's a total terror behind the wheel ( a bad woman driver ; now that's a clever and novel joke - - NOT ! ) , the lovely , throaty-voiced Helen Shaver as a sultry , saucy hooker who services customers in the back of her custom van , the always annoyingly infantile Howie Mandel as a dorky salesman , Sandee Currie as a sweet libidinous tramp , an especially obnoxious Peter Aykroyd as Currie's over-protective karate-choppin ' jerk of a brother , and , the saddest sight to behold in this depressingly awful spectacle , a criminally wasted Donald Sutherland as Nic the Noz , a sickeningly smug and patronizing hipster disc jockey who surveys all the carnage in his helicopter and serves as the picture's murderously haughty and condescending Greek chorus . A truly pitiful and unmitigated abomination .
Great title , lousy movie	Elderly college anthropology professor Ernest Prell ( stiffly played by former 30's bit actor Alan Brock ) and four obnoxiously hip students journey to the remote Pacific coast sandbar of Boot Island to confirm whether stories about an Abominable Snowman inhabiting the woods have any basis in fact . The professor and his students stay at the home of the professor's colleague Dr . Karl Werner ( woodenly portrayed by Tawn Ellis , who's best known as the star of the 50's Grade Z sci-fi clinker " Cat Women of the Moon " ) along with Werner's grunting Native American manservant Laughing Crow . The yeti soon makes its vicious presence felt , randomly dispatching two students and causing the survivors to degenerate into blind panic . WARNING : Major SPOILER ahead . In an absolutely awful would-be shocking twist ending the yeti proves to be a hoax , a ruse concocted by closet cannibals Prell , Werner and Laughing Crow to lure unsuspecting suckers to the island so they can kill and devour them . Any movie which features Hot Butter's insufferably interminable fluke hit instrumental " Popcorn " playing in its irritating entirety at a college frat party early in the action can't possibly be any good . Not surprisingly , this worthless grindhouse garbage qualifies as a crushing disappointment considering the people involved in its production : Besides the notorious 60's husband and wife roughie team of Michael and Roberta Findley ( who blessed us with the sensationally sick " Flesh " trilogy ) , we also got screenwriters Ed Adlum and Ed Kelleher ( the two dudes who are chiefly responsible for the terrifically tacky kitsch hoot " Invasion of the Blood Farmers " ) . Moreover , the cruddy mix of an unremittingly nihilistic tone , a disagreeably campy sense of archly affected humor ( " On the prowl / Hear him howl / Here comes the yeti now , " sings some smartaleck collegian as he plays the piano ) , rotten gore effects , wretched acting , horrendous dialogue ( " We're gonna find it , photograph it , and prove to the world that this fabled beast exists " ) , shoddy cinematography , and the cheesy gimmick of having a simulated heartbeat pound away on the soundtrack whenever the ersatz yeti is about to attack someone thoroughly negate any feeling of fun or entertainment value this dismal loser might have possessed . An unmitigated stiff .
An extremely dull and sub-par 70's low-budget horror revenge stinker	Six starving , desperate geologists are trapped in a cave for two weeks . Five of these guys cut off the arm of a sixth luckless dude and eat it . Shortly after the limb hacking incident , the men are saved by a rescue party . Five years later the understandably embittered fellow who got his appendage severed vows revenge . He begins killing the other five guys by cutting off one of their arms with a hatchet . While the sound premise certainly has plenty of potential , it's unfortunately undermined by a very dull and uninspired execution . Thomas S . Alderman's drab , listless direction and hideously talky'n'tedious script suck all the fun and vitality out of the solid story . The tame , unconvincing gore f / x , Philllan Bishop's shrill , unmelodious droning synthesizer score , the sluggish pace , Bob Maxwell's dark , bland , ugly cinematography and a real groaner of a would-be startling surprise " twist " ending are all likewise uniformly awful . Familiar 70's B-feature faces Deborah ( " Benji " ) Walley , Paul ( " The Bat People " ) Carr , John ( " Outlaw Blues " ) Crawford , Vince ( " The Candy Snatchers " ) Martorano , and Marvin ( " Fangs " ) Kaplan sleepwalk through their insipid parts , thereby failing to bring any energy or conviction to their boring and flatly drawn characters . Early in the film one character gravely intones , " Something's really rotten . " I wholeheartedly concur ; that something really rotten is this incredibly feeble and worthless chunk of atrocious cinematic offal .
A hideously lame'n'tame college-set horror slasher wash-out	Driven Dr . Philip Rothman ( a hopelessly insipid and less than sinister performance by Terry Lenderee ) conducts mind control experiments on students which in turn causes them to become crazy and murderous . Sound good ? Well , it sure ain't . For starters , writer / director Jerry Sangiuliano relates the meandering story at an excruciatingly sluggish pace and fails to build even a modicum of tension . Worse yet , the characters are all blah cardboard stereotypes : we've got the shameless slut ( Donna Bostany , who at least looks hot ) who sleeps with all her professors so she can earn passing grades , the no-nonsense police detective ( flatly played by Joe Lombardo ) who's determined to solve the case no matter what , and even the obligatory weirdo janitor ( Charles Lopresto , who at least looks creepy ) who's always lurking around every corner . Adding additional abject insult to already appalling injury are Larry Gelb's annoyingly shrill and redundant shivery synthesizer score , a numbing surplus of tedious talk , infrequent kill scenes , no nudity to speak of , extremely mild and largely bloodless violence , tacky 80's video game-style ( far from ) special effects , and a dissatisfying limp ending . This movie crucially lacks the necessary energy and sense of misguided enthusiasm to qualify as an enjoyably awful piece of schlock . Instead this flick is about as fun and exciting as watching two elderly turtles copulate . An immensely cruddy and unrewarding stiff .
An extremely dreary and forgettable clunker	Veteran character actor Marc Lawrence stars as your basic evil scientist who creates a dangerous , murderous , not-to-be-trifled race of robotic killer gorilla slaves . Lawrence's plans to overthrow the world are thwarted by a musclebound lunk ( stolidly played by former Hercules Brad Harris , who shows off his brawny chest as often as possible ) who's ventured into the doc's remote corner of the jungle in order to rescue some beautiful gal Lawrence has abducted . Seedy , grim , slow and humorless , with only the lovely presence of bodacious jungle babe Esmeralda Barros walking around mostly nude and the sporadic cheeseball gorilla gore effects offering any slight relief from Roger Morris ' static direction , a drab , talk-heavy script , uniformly stiff acting from an understandably uninspired cast , tatty production values , inert pacing , pathetically crummy and unconvincing ape suits , and a general air of ponderous , unrelenting tedium , this flick overall sizes up as a sleep-inducing dead slug of a stinker .
A real snoozer	Unhappily married rich lady Emanuelle ( luscious brunette knockout Malu ) is fed up with both her brutish , overbearing and disgusting lout husband Michael ( slimy Gianni Macchia ) and other men insensitively treating her like a piece of meat . So Emanuelle dumps Michael and gets involved in a torrid lesbian affair with enticing novelist Leona ( gorgeous stunner Micaela Lyonn ) . Sound good ? Well , it sure ain't so good due to Pasquale Fanetti's hopelessly flat and uninspired direction : Fanetti allows the sluggish pace to crawl along at an excruciatingly slow clip , a dull and drippy quality hangs heavy over the entire movie , and the whole thing crucially lacks any much-needed snazzy style or snappy momentum . While the female leads are certainly attractive ( and look quite delicious sans clothes ) , the soft-core sex scenes fail to generate any true heat because of Fanetti's bland presentation . You know a soft-core film isn't working when such seemingly can't miss ingredients as amply tasty distaff nudity , lesbianism , finger sucking , forced rough sex , erotic chopstick action , and voyeurism come across as boring and uninteresting . The insipidly droning mushy synthesizer score definitely doesn't help matters any . Only the sharp , pretty cinematography and the often nude beautiful bodies of the two female leads make this flick at least remotely watchable . But overall it's a total yawnfest .
A pretty mediocre and forgettable flick	This strangely colorless film blends elements from several different genres - - Mafia pictures , drug deal features , your basic shoot ' em up actionfest , and a standard car chase romp , all tied together with a mismatched buddy crime-fighting duo - - into a bland mishmash that crucially fails to develop a flavorful distinction which could have allowed all the disparate bits and pieces to jell into a pleasingly coherent and enjoyable whole . Moreover , the unmistakably British Roger Moore is horribly miscast as a partly Italian lawyer who's assigned by a powerful mob capo to nail the three brutal thugs who smuggled a million dollars worth of smack into the country by hiding the dope inside a large wooden cross . Moore , assisted by jocular grand prix professional race car driver Stacy Keach ( who gives a solid , lively performance that's much better than the insipid material deserves ) , pounds the pavement for the dirtbags and uncovers a series of double and triple crosses which lead to a shocking revelation of a grim secret stemming from Moore's shadowy past . Maurizio Lucidi's merely adequate direction remains resolutely workmanlike from start to finish , putting too much emphasis on dull chitchat during the opening and middle of the movie . In addition , the poky , erratic pace and a curious sense of unfortunate restraint prevents this picture from acquiring both the baroque style and trashy vitality it needs to seriously cook . However , things do finally come to life in the reasonably sound and exciting last half hour , with a rousing car chase and a few bloody shoot-outs enlivening the general tedium . Still , the humdrum script that was co-written by noted screenwriter Ernest Tidyman ( who also penned " Shaft " and " The French Connection " ) and future " Grease " director Randal Kleiser , sticks too closely to run-of-the-mill predictable and unsurprising crime thriller conventions , thereby making this mediocre outing a strictly middling and passable time-killer at best .
A pretty good , but flawed made-for-TV musical adaptation of the classic story	Here's a very unlikely and peculiar fright feature : an early 70's NBC-TV musical adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic Victorian-era novella with an unusually cast Kirk Douglas in the dual role of the good-hearted , blandly respectable Dr . Jekyll and his evil , lusty , gleefully immoral and animalistic id-run-amok alter ego Mr . Hyde . What's most surprising about this audaciously imaginative enterprise is how to a sizable degree it works extremely well . There's no denying that the schizophrenic titular part is any true actor's dream role ; Douglas clearly knows this and gladly sinks his teeth into the part , playing the two wildly contrasting characters with lip-smacking brio . The rest of the cast is made up of top-drawer British thespians : Susan Hampshire radiates considerable charm as Jekyll's fiancé , Sir Michael Redgrave portrays Hampshire's prim'n'proper gentleman father to stuffy perfection , Donald Pleasence simply delights as a petty , scraggly street peddler , Susan George has a grand bawdy time as a fiercely proud and blithely naughty saloon showgirl , and Stanley Holloway displays an appropriate amount of concern as Jekyll's loyal , worried butler . Sherman Yellen's script astutely captures the repressive mores and scientific curiosity which defined late 19th century London . The lavish costumes and fog-shrouded sets vividly evoke the period . The score by Lionel Bart , Mel Mandell and Norman Sachs is rather hit-or-miss , supplying a decidedly mixed bag of tunes which range from mediocre and forgettable to lively and enjoyable . The better songs are good , jaunty fun , distinguished by especially catchy and witty lyrics . The cast belt out the songs with terrifically infectious aplomb ; it's a real treat to see Douglas , Pleasence and the underrated George cheerfully rip into their numbers . Alas , there are a few glaring flaws which gum things up to a fair extent : pedestrian , workmanlike direction by David Winters ( who later helmed the laughably bad Joe Spinell psycho vehicle " The Last Horror Film " ) , flat cinematography , and a blurry , rough-on-the-eyes shot-on-video look that results in an ugly and unappealing visual texture . These faults asides , this picture still holds up as an admirably fresh and novel take on an often-told hoary old chestnut creepy tale .
An interesting and original contemporary horror sleeper on a familiar premise	Nice guy college student Thierry Richard ( a solid and engaging performance by Marc Paquet ) meets and immediately falls in love with mysterious , yet bewitching redhead Claire ( superbly played by the lovely Marianne Farley ) . Despite his aversion to redheads , Thierry just can't resist Claire . However , Thierry finds himself in considerable jeopardy when he encounters Claire's oddball mother and sisters , who share a very dark and disturbing family secret . Thierry's loyal , happy-go-lucky best friend and apartment roommate Henri Dieudonne ( a marvelously hearty and likable portrayal by Frederic Pierre ) tries to save Thiery before it's too late . Director Daniel Roby , who also co-wrote the smart and inspired script with Joel Champetier , grounds the compelling story in a thoroughly believable everyday world which in turn makes the more horrific elements of the plot that much more chilling and upsetting . Moreover , Roby brings an intriguing air of mystery to the picture and nicely maintains a spooky tone throughout ( the bleak wintry Canadian locations go a long way to enhance the overall eerie and unsettling mood ) . Kudos are also in order for the uniformly fine acting by the capable cast : Richard , Farley and Pierre all do sterling work in their roles while Jessica Malka likewise excels as Claire's crazed and vicious bitchy whore sister Marquise . Eric Cayla's bright , crisp cinematography and the funky , rattling score by Rene Dupere and Martin Lord are both up to speed . Best of all , there's even a potent and poignant central message about how far one is willing to go for love and a refreshing absence of any dumb obtrusive humor to diminish the severity of the horror . This movie offers proof positive that you don't need a lot of fancy special effects , excessive gore , or flashy film-making to create a strong and effective fright feature . Well worth checking out .
A nicely gritty and trashy 70's drive-in exploitation film noir crime picture	Brassy , sharp-witted , take-charge vixen-on-wheels Ellie ( leggy , beauteous 70's B-movie perennial Tiffany Bolling at her most trampy and tantalizing ) and her adorable , dewy-eyed , flirtatious younger sister Myra ( cute , tiny , girlish Robin Mattson , who served her time in such grind-house schlock as " Candy Stripe Nurses " and " Return to Macon County " before moving on to more respectable work in the soap operas " All My Children , " " General Hospital , " " Ryan's Hope , " and " Santa Barbara " ) are a pair of delectable , no where near as " innocent " as they seem country babes who live in relative squalor with their gross , irritable , lecherous step-dad Charlie ( a memorably vile Leo Gordon ) , a real scuzzbucket who gets blasted by a shotgun-hefting Ellie after he attempts to rape Myra . Ellie and Myra hightail it to the big city and hole up with their wealthy , crooked Uncle Ben ( the ever-gruff Scott Brady ) , who's elbow deep in assorted illegal activities . Ben's shady sleazeball partner Eddie ( a sensationally slimy performance from consummate hambone thespian Alex Rocco ) and Eddie's equally no-count libidinous pal Digger ( a coolly vicious Timothy Brown ) hire dopey , wishy-washy private eye Larry Evans ( an amiably addle-pated Steve Sandor ) to pick up a valuable suitcase full of mucho stolen loot ; Ben sends Ellie along to make sure the pick-up goes smoothly . Naturally , Larry and Ellie become an item , acquire the package , and decide to keep the hot cash all for themselves . They hightail it to Mexico . Eddie and Digger give chase . Graced with an appropriately amoral , cold-blooded tone , several suitably mean and jolting plot twists , languorous , but steady pacing , a nice streak of bitch-black humor ( Digger and Eddie accidentally blow away the wrong couple at a seedy motel ! ) , and generous offerings of sex , violence and nudity , " Bonnie's Kids " makes for a really enjoyable , fairly surprising and pleasingly junky nickel'n'dime crime melodrama which nicely fits into the then faddish film noir tradition ( Bolling in particular makes for a marvelously bitchy and conniving femme fatale ) . Arthur ( " J . D . ' s Revenge " ) Marks ' solid direction and the clever script carry the day with commendably brisk , no-frills efficiency , capably abetted by Carson Whitset's funky , insouciant , rumbling jazz score , Robert Charles Wilson's adroit , animated , occasionally leering cinematography ( Mattson takes a welcome nude bath at the very start of the picture and Bolling is first seen in an eye-catching rear end sticking up at the camera shot , looking mighty desirable in a tight , clingy hash slinger uniform ) , a gritty subtext which explores with stark frankness the grim reality concerning greed and betrayal , a wonderfully wicked surprise bummer ending , and top-rate cameos from veteran character actor Max Showalter as a sludgebag traveling salesman and a pre - " Cagney and Lacey " Sharon Gless as a weary greasy spoon waitress . An unjustly neglected little sleeper which was often double-billed with the fantastic " The Candy Snatchers " at drive-ins back in the day .
A choice scuzzy chunk of hardcore nasty 70's psycho exploitation horror sleaze	Simone ( Manuela Thiess ) , Sheri ( Sherry Alberoni ) , and Corrine ( Gyl Roland ) are three showgirls en route to Las Vegas who find themselves stranded when their car breaks down in the middle of the remote Nevada desert . They run afoul of Andre ( a truly inspired portrayal of full-tilt intense insanity by the one and only Andrew Prine ) , a severely deranged Oedipal wreck misogynistic psycho who abducts lovely young stray ladies so he can use them in a menagerie for his own personal circus . Meanwhile , Andre's grotesquely disfigured mutant father occasionally gets loose and murders folks . Director Alan Rudolph , who went on to helm such acclaimed art-house hits as " Welcome to L . A . , " " Remember My Name , " " Choose Me , " and " The Moderns , " does an expert job of creating and maintaining a grim , sordid , and unpleasant tone of seething madness and depravity . The raw , unflinching violence against women is genuinely brutal and ugly stuff ; this picture reaches its skin-crawling nasty peak when Andre has a large boa constrictor wrap itself around one hapless lass . Moreover , we also get a decent smattering of tasty nudity and a handy helping of grisly gore . E . Lynn's rough , but fairly accomplished cinematography astutely captures the dingy , dusty , and desolate aura of the isolated desert location . Tommy Vig's wonky , spacey , droning score likewise adds considerably to the overall harsh and unnerving quality of this resolutely foul-minded trash . Jennifer Ashley pops up as a traumatized mute hippie chick ; she was mistreated by Prine some more in the even sleazier and hence better " The Centerfold Girls . " The groovy theme song " Evil Eyes " and the nihilistic bummer ending totally hit the slimy spot as well . A satisfyingly mean'n'grungy serving of vintage 70's grindhouse junk .
An unintentionally hilarious and hence quite enjoyable 80's college slasher hoot	Undoubtedly the most uproariously ridiculous of the popular 80's kill-the-collegians slasher movies , a cool little slice'n'dice sub-genre which includes such gnarly gems as " The Dorm That Dripped Blood , " " The House on Sorority Row , " " Girls Nite Out , " " The Initiation , " and " Sorority House Massacre . " This one's wafer-thin plot is about a gala April Fool's Day bash held in a haunted house which turns sour when a psychotic lunatic in a deep-sea diving suit ( yes , you read that correctly ) starts to pick off moronic college students in assorted grisly ways ( the guillotine decapitation qualifies as the definite splatter highlight ) . WARNING : Possible SPOILERS ahead . At very end of this gut-busting howler the killer is revealed to be the vengeful ghost of a college pledge who was accidentally killed twenty years ago ! With its great deadpan direction by veteran Canadian schlock horror director William Fruet ( who next gave us the lively big killer bug riot " Blue Monkey " ) , absurd plot , charmingly goofy characters , slick photography , funky score , a scene-stealingly geeky performance by Ralph Seymour ( one of the imperiled campers in the superior sylvan slaughterfest " Just Before Dawn " ) as nutty campus nerd Martin , and a funny cameo by the ever droll Paul Bartel as uptight English Professor Zito , this sublimely silly affair overall sizes up as a delightfully dopey dilly .
An enjoyably dippy serving of melodramatic 70's drive-in junk	Smooth hotshot lawyer Jerry Bounds ( a solid performance by Adam West of TV's " Batman " fame ) clashes with huffy and powerful rival veteran attorney Pike Smith ( a pleasingly crusty and lively portrayal by John Anderson ) over a big case involving a water company . Smith hires the sultry and enticing Londa Wyeth ( perfectly embodied by the gorgeously voluptuous Ahna Capri ) to pose as a jury member and befriend Bounds so he can be disbarred from the profession . Director / co-writer Hikmet Avedis , who also appears in the film as sleazy low-rent private eye Ace Sharkey , relates the engrossingly lurid story at a steady pace , maintains a lighthearted tone throughout , and sprinkles in a handy helping of tasty female nudity ( lovely blonde Christianne Schmidtmer has a small , yet memorable role as a nude model while Capri looks positively smashing sans clothes ) . The sturdy cast of familiar faces helps out a whole lot : Alvy Moore as the lecherous Bailiff Humbolt , Marlene Schmidt as Bounds ' concerned , supportive wife Elizabeth , Harvey Jason as Pike's laid-back swinging artist son Hardin Smith , Charles Knopp as hard-nosed Judge Davis , and Chuck Boyd as wimpy law firm head Arthur Farley . Massoud Joseph's crisp cinematography and Shorty Rogers ' get-down funky score are both up to speed . Moreover , the insanely groovy theme song sung by Lou Rawls , some amusingly dated slang ( " far out " ) , a hysterically overwrought disbarment trial , and a simply sidesplitting surprise downbeat ending all greatly add to this picture's considerable kitschy appeal . In fact , this movie often plays like an R-rated feature length 70's exploitation version of an episode of " Perry Mason . " A fun little diversion .
An amusingly lowbrow parody of low-budget trash film-making	Sexy and slutty young Candy Faraday ( a divinely bitchy portrayal by the gorgeous Delia Sheppard ) tries to get geeky screenwriter Lou Lurrod ( likable Steven Benton ) to bump off her mean , overbearing cheapskate schlock movie producer husband King Faraday ( essayed with deliciously hammy relish by Robert Quarry ) and use his latest low-budget junk opus as the perfect cover for the murder . Director Jeff Broadstreet pokes gleefully silly fun at dimestore dreck cinema and brings a cheesy quality to the picture which perfectly matches the trashy subject matter . Comic highlights include a gut-busting send-up of music videos and the auditions for " Werewolves in Heat . " Robert Benson's witty script offers plenty of snappy dialogue and enjoyably broad caricatures ( King Faraday in particular is a complete sleazy riot ) . The lively acting from a game cast qualifies as another substantial asset : the ever-adorable Linnea Quigley as sweet scream queen Phoebe Love , Dennis Dale as eager hack director Rake Webber , Veronica Hart as King Faraday's bratty daughter Lola , Stephen Liska as amiable loan shark Gersch Stephan Steingulian , Spice Williams as hot bodybuilder Sabina , and Scott Coulter as flaky make-up f / x guy Mitchell Froom . Dale Larsen's suitably ratty cinematography and Leonard Marcel's bluesy , funky score both further enhance the infectiously tacky merriment . Better still , the luscious Linnea bares her beautiful breasts right at the start of the film while the delectable Delia shows off her yummy body several times . A real blithely inane hoot .
Good , silly retro 50's giant monster horror fun	Carmen Electra holds a concert on a remote tropical island that's located in the middle of the Bermuda Triangle . Carmen gets abducted by a giant monster insect . A motley group of kids bravely venture into the dangerous jungle to rescue Carmen . A camera crew tags along to film their adventure for a reality TV show . Director Jack Perez , who also co-wrote the cheerfully absurd'n'inane tongue-in-cheek cornball script with Adam Glass , maintains a constant steady pace and deftly creates an infectiously goofy mock-serious tone that pays affectionate homage to lovably ludicrous cheap'n'cheesy 50's sci-fi / horror creature features . The appealingly sincere acting from an eager and attractive cast rates as a major plus , with especially winning turns by Daniel Letterle as the sullen Josh , Mary Elizabeth Winstead as gutsy brunette hottie Maddy , Casey Beddow as the nerdy Andy , Chelan Simmons as feisty blonde babe Jen , C . Ernst Harth as bullish bodyguard Eightball , and Chris Harrison as hatefully cowardly wannabe macho jerk Chase . Adam West hams it up with tremendous lip-smacking relish as wacky mad scientist Dr . Harryhausen and Carmen portrays her own splendidly sweet'n'sexy self with charm to spare . Backstreet Boy Nick Carter pops up at the very end so he can save the day in the nick of time . David Bowes ' funky herky-jerky stop-motion animation and the obvious tacky miniatures are both hilariously hokey . Todd Elyzen's polished cinematography makes artful use of fades and dissolves . Michael Richard Plowman's rousing score likewise hits the spot . Best of all , there's a sense of pure good-natured silly fun evident throughout that's both endearing and entertaining in equal measure . A delightfully dippy hoot .
A really fun Japanese giant creature flick	This comment is on the original Japanese version of the film . A group of researchers investigate the disappearance of two colleagues in the mountains of northeastern Japan . They discover lethal and ill-tempered behemoth prehistoric lizard Varan , who awakens and makes an immediate beeline to Tokyo with the specific intent of trashing the town . Can the military stop Varan before it's too late ? Director Ishiro Honda expertly creates an intriguingly eerie atmosphere in the opening third of the picture and does a bang-up job of maintaining a brisk , exciting and unrelenting forward-ho momentum in the thrilling second half . Moreover , Honda stages the expected mondo destructo stuff ( Varan totals a village ) and pitched confrontations with the army with rip-snorting flair and gusto to spare . The flying , reptilian , spike-backed Varan makes for a truly fearsome titanic beast . Kudos are also in order for the snazzy special effects , Hajime Koizumi's sharp widescreen black and white cinematography , the credible acting from a solid cast , the bleakly serious tone , and Akira Ifukube's lively , stirring , all-out orchestral score . A hugely enjoyable montermash .
An enjoyably lightweight piece of 70's drive-in fluff	Shy , but sweet and enticing Dina ( winningly played with infectiously perky charm by the lovely Kim Lankford ) starts her new job as a lifeguard at Malibu beach and immediately turns a lot of guys ' heads . Cool dude Bobby ( likable James Daughton ) and his funky buddy Paul ( the equally engaging Michael Luther ) befriend Dina and her spunky gal pal Sally ( the luscious Susan Player-Jarreau ) . Moreover , Bobby gets involved in a bitter rivalry with sneering brawny greaser Dugan Hicks ( essayed with mucho macho muscle by beefy biker flick regular Stephen Oliver ) . Director Robert J . Rosenthal , who also co-wrote the slight script with Celia Susan Cotelo , lets the loose and rambling narrative amble along at a leisurely pace , but does a solid job of capturing a certain amiably breezy'n'easy mellow tone . In addition , Rosenthal crams this baby with a generous smattering of tasty gratuitous female nudity , plus there's skinny-dipping , pot smoking , groovy disco dancing , hot babes in skimpy bikinis , and a bouncy soundtrack made up of roughly three catchy tunes . Better still , we even have an adorable dog with a pleasing penchant for stealing girls ' bikini tops . Popping up in neat supporting roles are the ever-yummy Tara Strohmeier as the foxy Glorianna , Flora Plumb as attractive teacher Mrs . Pickett , Roger Lawrence Pierce as the hopelessly geeky Claude , Rory Stevens as gawky hot dog stand vendor Charlie , Bruce Kimball as laid-back cop Lyle , and Bill Adler as an obnoxious vanner . Jamie Anderson's bright cinematography gives this picture a sparkling polished look . Michael Lloyd's gnarly-grinding score hits the soulful spot . All in all , this admittedly inane and immaterial nonsense makes for a pleasantly silly diversion .
A sweet and engaging comedy	Bud Spencer gives a wonderfully warm and charming performance as Bulldozer , an amiable , but ill-tempered former pro football player turned fisherman who's recruited by a wacky gang of street people to whip them into shape for a major all-or-nothing football game against a rival group of American soldiers led by gung-ho jerk Sergeant Kempfer ( a deliciously obnoxious portrayal by Raimund Harmstorf ) . Director Michele Lupo and screenwriters Marcello Fondato and Francesco Scardamaglia concoct a blithely silly and lighthearted comedy that not only delivers the expected amusingly goofy slapstick humor ( several wild rough'n'tumble fight scenes in particular are absolutely hilarious ) , but also a nice small coastal town atmosphere , likable characters , and a truly uplifting story in which Bulldozer gives his misfit team a much-needed sense of self-worth while the team in turn help Bulldozer regain his passion for the game . Spencer easily carries the film on his massive shoulders as the decent and honorable Bulldozer ; he receives excellent support from Kempfer , Ottaviano Dell'Aqua as smartaleck Gerry , Marco Stefanelli as lanky klutz Tony , Giovanni Vettorazzo as swift , wily thief Spitz , and Reinhard Kolldehoff as the stern Colonel Martin . Both Franco Di Giacomo's slick cinematography and the bubbly score by Guido and Maurizio De Angelis are up to speed . The climactic football game is very funny , gripping and exciting . A hugely enjoyable little hoot .
A gut-busting spoof of early 80's slasher flicks	A depraved killer known as the Breather ( voiced with hysterically lecherous aplomb by stand-up comedian Richard Belzer ) bumps off the libidinous students of Lamab High School in assorted highly imaginative ways ( the psycho's unlikely and inventive implements of death include paper clips , an eggplant , and even an eraser ! ) . Writer / director Mickey Rose offers broad parodies of such popular fright fare as " Halloween , " " Friday the 13th , " " When a Stranger Calls , " " Carrie , " and " Prom Night ; " the humor found herein is crude , raunchy , unsubtle , tasteless , offensive , inspired ( I loved the on-screen tally which keeps track of the ever-mounting corpse count ) , and hence flat-out hilarious . This is the type of no-holds-barred open season on everyone and everything raucous humor that was prevalent in the pre-politically correct 80's and that's exactly why this picture is often so incredibly funny . For example , there's a black foreign exchange student who nobody misses after he gets killed . Plus there are jokes about handicapped people as well . However , the tone is thankfully silly and amiable enough to prevent this film from seeming nasty and mean-spirited . The lively and enthusiastic acting from a game no-name cast rates as another significant plus : Kristen Riter makes for a most charming and fetching virginal innocent heroine , Joe Flood is an absolute hoot as deranged workshop teacher Mr . Dumpkin , and spindly comedian the Stick steals the whole show as dim-witted double-jointed janitor Malvert . A total riot . And remember folks , sex kills .
A grimly compelling short film	Frustrated artist Christopher ( a fine performance by Mark Baranowski ) can't handle failure and rejection anymore , so he commits suicide by taking an overdose of pills . His loving wife Yvette ( well played by the fetching Ryli Morgan ) discovers her husband's corpse , sinks into a heavy funk , strips naked , and kills herself as well . Writer / director Baranowski presents this unremittingly bleak story in a very engrossing and straightforward manner ; the rough , grainy , fuzzy shot-on-video cinematography , the monotonous , but still effectively shuddery score , the plain lighting , the methodically slow pacing , and the spare , laconic script further enhance the suffocatingly gloomy tone . As a tasty added bonus , the luscious Morgan spends the bulk of her screen time showing off her nice , shapely body in all its deliciously nude splendor . Provocative downbeat philosophical point : Life isn't what you make of it ; it's what life makes of you that really counts . Sure , this film makes for extremely depressing viewing , but it's still a strangely haunting and unsettling descent into sheer despair just the same .
An immensely entertaining female warrior romp	Fiery Antiope ( well played with admirable gusto by gorgeous blonde stunner Alena Johnston ) becomes queen of a mighty tribe of formidable Amazon women and enforces a strict code to keep them strong . Bitter rival Oreitheia ( a suitably fierce portrayal by lovely brunette Sabine Sun ) tries to have Antiope dethroned . Further complications ensue when Antiope has to mate with charming and noble Greek king Theseus ( an engaging performance by Angelo Infanti ) and winds up falling in love with him . Director Terence Young relates this wild and melodramatic tale of savage conflict and inflammatory passions at a swift pace , stages the exciting battle sequences with considerable aplomb , and loads this flick with a pleasing plenitude of tasty bare distaff skin ( the definite highlight occurs when Antiope and Oreitheia participate in a ferocious anything-goes catfight clad solely in their birthday suits ! ) . Moreover , we also get a few vigorous rough'n'ready swordfights , a memorably steamy wrestling match between two delectable half-nude honeys , and even a little lesbianism to further spice up the already delicious cinematic brew . Of course , having such luscious ladies as Helga Line , Rosanna Yanni , Malisa Longo , and Luciana Paluzzi in sizable supporting roles doesn't hurt matters in the least . The expansive cinematography by Aldo Tonti and Alejandro Ulloa gives the picture an impressively massive sense of scope . Riz Ortolani's full-bore robust'n'rousing orchestral score likewise hits the stirring spot . A really fun flick .
An excellent and unjustly overlooked action / revenge winner	An evil corporation tries to pressure a bunch of Arkansas farmers and ranchers to sell their land so they can strip-mine it for coal . The fiercely proud and stubborn Hunter family refuse to give in . This leads to a bitter conflict that results in several casualties . Eventually the take-charge no-nonsense Tom Hunter ( superbly played by Peter Fonda ) exacts a harsh revenge on the villains with the help of his bow and arrow . Capably directed by Jonathan Demme ( who also wrote the smart , compact script ) , with sharp , picturesque cinematography by Michael W . Watkins , a strong and deliciously vivid evocation of the rural south , a wealth of pleasingly quirky incidental details , a flavorsome country score by Bruce Langhorne , likable well-drawn characters , a constant quick pace , and plenty of exciting action , this bang-up little picture really hits the spot . The stellar cast helps matters a whole lot : the ever-lovely Lynn Lowry as Tom's concerned girlfriend Lorene , John Doucette as Tom's feisty , amiable dad Jeff , Philip Carey as slimy mining company tycoon Pierce Crabtree , Scott Glenn as Tom's rugged brother Charlie , Harry Northup as the ineffectual Sheriff Len Skerritt , and Noble Willingham as the crooked Senator Hingle . The lean and lanky Fonda makes for a totally credible and engaging action lead . The climax with Fonda singlehandedly taking on the bad guys is extremely tense and thrilling . A really solid and satisfying unsung sleeper .
A hilariously ridiculous mess	Poor Maria is married to a hideously abusive and impotent old cripple . She's having an affair with the hunky gardener Roberto . Her cousin runs Roberto over with his car . Maria goes to an old witch lady and has a spell done so both she and Roberto will be reincarnated twenty years later . Cue twenty years later . Maria , sad and lonely , meets the reincarnation of Roberto , but alas he's married and hence not interested in her . So Maria enlists the aid of an evil , cackling , snake-worshiping sorcerer to cast a spell on Roberto so she can finally have him . Got that ? Well , I'm not quite sure if that above plot synopsis is entirely correct , but it's the best I can do . Director Yeung Kong fails miserably to add any much-needed coherence to this often uproariously awful and muddled mess of a supernatural romantic horror flick . Luckily , there's a wealth of tasty female nudity and a handy helping of sizzling soft-core sex scenes to keep things pleasingly sleazy throughout . ( However , in one hysterically strenuous sex scene involving the evil lascivious sorcerer and a hapless young lady a big glowing white dot covers the woman's pubic area ! ) . The funky , throbbing score , a gnarly tribe of nasty cannibal dwarfs , and a smidgen of suitably gross last reel gore further add to the strangely compelling and frequently unintentionally sidesplitting anything-goes surreal fun of this enjoyably senseless head-scratcher .
Michael Ironside makes for a memorably nasty and scary psycho in this underrated early 80's Canadian woman-in-jeopardy thriller	Vicious misogynistic psycho par excellence Colt Hawker ( a truly chilling and convincing portrayal of seething brutality by the always intense and effective Michael Ironside , who's positively terrifying in a substantial full-blown villain role ) assaults feisty and outspoken feminist TV reporter Deborah Ballin ( a fine Lee Grant ) in her home after she delivers a scathing put-down of male chauvinism on live television . The badly wounded Ballin barely survives the attack and gets taken to a nearby hospital to be treated for her injuries . Hawker follows Ballin there so he can continue his relentless campaign of terror against her . Director Jean-Claude ( " The Vindicator " ) Lord keeps the film mostly tight and suspenseful throughout , delivering one jolting shock after another until the movie culminates in a harrowing showdown between the two bitter adversaries . Lord strives for gritty realism and generally succeeds with this goal , adeptly creating a hard , rough and above all pretty plausible edge which in turn makes the unflinchingly ugly and sadistic violence that much more potent and disturbing . Moreover , Linda Purl offers strong support as a sympathetic nurse ( the sequence where Ironside assaults Purl in her house is genuinely bloodcurdling ) while both Harvey ( " Meatballs " ) Atkin and Helen ( " Incubus , " " Blue Monkey " ) Hughes pop up as two of Hawker's unfortunate victims . On the debit side the rather drawn-out 105 minute running time causes the picture to drag in spots and the usually more manic William Shatner is strangely subdued and soporific as Ballin's insufferably insipid stuffed shirt of a boss . Unjustly ridiculed by a majority of critics when it was first released and often erroneously tagged as just another mindless hack ' em up slasher item ( which it most certainly isn't ) , " Visiting Hours " rates highly as a smart , gripping and overall superior thriller that's much better than its unfairly lousy reputation would suggest .
A gloriously bizarre soft-core oddity	A hippie love cult led by the stern , yet charismatic the Divine One ( perfectly embodied by the delicious Laura Gemser ) lures young innocents for their money and corrupts them in the name of their cause . The blithely passive and brainwashed cult members fornicate like bunnies , frolic about in their birthday suits , prostitute themselves for cash , engage in ritualistic chants , and get brutally whipped when they disobey the stern rules . Complications ensue when loyal recruiter and disciple Dorian ( blonde doofus Christian Anders ) falls for the fetching Patricia ( lovely and voluptuous Simone Brahmann ) , who's the wealthy daughter of a powerful American senator . Writer / director Anders offers an enjoyably oddball cross between " Hair " ( the incredibly dippy disco theme song and a couple of crazy song and dance numbers are both totally sidesplitting , albeit unintentionally so ) and the infamous Jim Jones religious cult that certainly doesn't skimp on either the plentiful tasty nudity or the equally abundant sizzling soft-core sex ( we've got straight , lesbian , and interracial couplings served up hot and spicy for the viewer's delight ) . The heightened erotic atmosphere and Gemser's smoldering sensuous presence ensure that this film never becomes dull . Better still , Anders treats all the wild and raw carnality with complete seriousness , which in turn greatly enhances the picture's considerable campy charm ( a twisted ceremony involving the deflowering of the virginal youngest cult member rates as a definite loopy highlight ) . A delectably daft and decadent doozy .
An excellent period action drama winner	The evil Kuan ( a perfectly hateful Shek Kin ) steals two swords from the peaceful martial arts sect the Supreme Gate . Strong , willful master swordswoman Yuk Bin ( superbly played by the lovely Betty Loh Ti ) gets ousted from the Supreme Gate for being Kuan's daughter . Things become worse for Yuk Bin after she's blinded by Kuan in a fight . Kindly mentor Nam Chee ( affable Zhang Yang ) teaches Yuk Bin how to overcome her affliction and retain her sword-fighting skills . When the equally wicked , arrogant and power mad Sun Tai Yong ( marvelously essayed with rip-snorting cocky relish by Kelly Lai Chen ) takes over the Supreme Gate and defeats all the other master sword-fighters , only Yuk Bin remains to defeat him . Director Chiu Feng Yuan , working from a complex and engrossing script by Faan Yee , delivers a potent and gripping tale about honor , loyalty and betrayal . The astounding choreography and exceptional stuntwork are both on the money arresting and exciting , with lots of wild leaps and jumps as well as a copious amount of graphic bloodletting . The estranged relationship between Kuan and Yuk Bin is quite potent and moving . The breathtaking widescreen cinematography , the rousing , energetic , majestic score , and the beautiful rural countryside setting further enhance the sound quality of this solid , stirring and highly satisfying film .
A very good and effective 80's low-budget horror winner	Lovely Linda Brewster ( a warm and appealing performance by ravishing redhead hottie supreme Tawny Kitaen ) becomes obsessed with contacting the spirit of a deceased little boy with a Ouija Board . Linda finds herself in substantial peril when she encounters a malevolent spirit which plans on taking possession of her mind and soul . It's up to Linda's scruffy , skeptical blue collar boyfriend Jim ( an engaging performance by Todd Allen ) and her smart , slick college-educated former lover Brandon ( the equally solid Stephen Nichols ) to stop the evil supernatural force before it's too late . Writer / director Kevin S . ( " Night of the Demons " ) Tenney relates the scary story at a gradual pace , carefully crafting the suspense and ably creating likable and believable characters who are credibly grounded in an everyday world . Tenney wisely downplays graphic splatter and cheap visceral jolts in favor of drama and tension , delivering only decent dollops of mild gore , staging the ample shocks with a reasonable amount of skill and flair , and eliciting winningly sound and sincere acting from a fine cast ( Kathleen Wilhoite in particular contributes a wonderfully funny and quirky turn as a spunky eccentric punkette psychic ) . Moreover , both Roy H . Wagner's impressively glossy photography and Dennis Michael Tenney's spooky score further add to the movie's overall sterling quality . But what really gives this picture a big lift out of the rut is the surprising surplus of genuine heart and feeling evident in the strained , yet still strong friendship between Jim and Brandon , which brings a pathos to the picture that's both touching and refreshing . A modest , but surefire low-budget indie horror winner .
A very offbeat and interesting early 70's post-nuke sci-fi curio	An intriguingly spartan and offbeat avant-garde early 70's excursion into post-nuke sci-fi survivalist cinema centering on the obsessive Glen ( muscular , curly-haired Steven Curry ) and his more passive female companion Randa ( a sweetly disarming performance by the lovely , willowy Shelley Plimpton ) , a pair of guileless youths trying to eke out a meager existence amid the desolate ruins following an atomic war . After a wily , lecherous old magician ( a wonderfully rascally turn by Garry Goodrow ) visits Glen and Randa's camp and fills Glen's head full of tales about a great lost city , Glen and a now-pregnant Randa ( the magician impregnated her ) embark on a dangerous trek across the harsh , ravaged terrain to discover this great city that Glen first read all about in an old " Wonder Women " comic book . During their perilous quest Glen and Randa meet a friendly , doddering elderly man ( an endearingly crotchety Woodrow Chambliss ; Uncle Willie in the funky ' 72 made-for-TV creature feature favorite " Gargoyles " ) and Randa gives birth to a baby . Director Jim McBride ( who later helmed such better known big budget films as " The Big Easy " and " Great BAlls of Fire " ) skillfully uses an extremely plain , basic and unpolished no-frills cinematic style to plausibly create a vivid depiction of the banality and hopelessness of day-to-day post-holocaust existence , thus giving this bleak , albeit strangely haunting and affecting apocalyptic vision an unshakable sense of gritty , lived-in conviction . The bare-bones , but eloquent and sometimes wittily droll script by McBride , Lorenzo Manns , and Rudolph Wurlitzer ( who went on to write " Two-Lane Blacktop " and " Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid " ) relates with deceptive simplicity and straightforwardness a lyrically powerful parable with provocative religious allusions ( Glen and Randa's odyssey could be interpreted as Adam and Eve's fall from grace after leaving the garden of Eden ) about lost innocence and a futile search for an irrevocably vanished past paradise . Kudos as well to Alan Raymond's flat , spare , minimalist cinematography , which uses long , lingering , unedited takes , stately tracking shots , and elegant fade-outs to convey a wealth of striking visuals : the rusty hulk of a car with tree branches growing out of it , a horde of grimy survivors glumly rummaging through the rubble for cans of food , Randa ravenously devouring grass and worms , Glen savagely beating several fish with a stick , and the oddly poignant final shot of Glen and the old man drifting out to sea on a rickety boat are all indelible moments that stick in your memory after seeing the movie . A pleasingly quirky and truly novel one-of-a-kind experimental oddity .
A perfectly stupid final installment in the enjoyably idiotic series	Lovable airhead Candy ( the adorably daffy Elizabeth Kaitan ) and her brassy rival Traci ( the delightfully sassy Raelyn Saalman ) run afoul of a gang of sexy , but nefarious bikini-clad bank-robbing strippers . Ramrod Internal Affairs detective Hank Grisham ( a perfectly jerky Brad Parker ) wrongly assumes that Candy was an accomplice to the robbery and sends her to jail . Meanwhile , the ever-frustrated Miss Devonshire ( essayed with trademark sidesplitting slow-burn comic aplomb by Jayne Hamil ) is fuming over the fact that the pompous buffoon commissioner ( Jay Richardson in excellent blustery form ) has forgotten their first wedding anniversary . Writer / director Rick Sloane works his customary engagingly witless no-brainer cinematic magic with a steady succession of amusingly lowbrow jokes on such utterly uproarious topics as strippers , women beating up men , tabloid TV shows , annoyingly perky bimbo cheerleaders , and phone sex hotlines . The lively and attractive cast have a ball with their broad roles : Kaitan and Saalman display an engagingly loosey-goosey chemistry as the fetching female leads , Honey Lauren is a tart treat as brash hooker Monique McClure , plus there are nice supporting turns by Chad Gabbert as the commissioner's nerdy son Irwin , Tamara Clatterbuck as yummy blonde Sophisticacia , Angela Castelli as scorching hot brunette Tease , Joanne Rubino as hardened felon Lactacia , Karen Knotts as chipper prison guard Mavis , and Mark Richardson as sleazy strip club owner Bojangles . Stephen Crawford's static cinematography is merely passable while both Alan DerMarderosian's zany score and Marky Desade's gnarly-thrashin ' theme song " Pistol Whipped " both hit the funky spot . The bank robbery sequence is hilariously horrendous ; the madcap ending is positively gut-busting as well . As an added bonus , both Kaitan and Castelli bare their beautiful breasts . A total dippy hoot .
A worthy follow-up to the outstanding original	This surprisingly solid sequel starts off immediately where the original ended , with poor Laurie Strode ( the ever-personable Jamie Lee Curtis ) being sent to the local hospital to be treated for her injuries . Naturally , the relentless Michael Myers ( an effectively eerie pantomime performance by veteran stuntman Dick Warlock ) continues to stalk Laurie . Wildly obsessive psychiatrist Dr . Loomis ( Donald Pleasence deliciously hamming it up with his usual rip-snorting brio ) comes to the rescue . Director Rick Rosenthal does a capable job of creating a palpably claustrophobic atmosphere , maintains a steady pace throughout , and stages the grisly murder set pieces with nasty aplomb ( gory highlights include a couple of throat slashings , a hammer to the head , and a needle through the eye , plus one victim even gets drained of all her blood ) . A strong bunch of actors and actresses acquit themselves well as the hospital staff , with especially praiseworthy turns by Lance Guest as a nice guy orderly , Leo Rossi as a crass foul-mouthed jerk ambulance driver , the lovely Pamela Susan Shoop as a sweet nurse ( Shoop also does a great topless scene ) , Cliff Emmich as a diligent security guard , and Ford Rainey as a weary old doctor . The hospital setting proves to be suitably remote and stifling ; there's a sense of isolation and vulnerability to the place that's genuinely unnerving . But what really makes this movie a sound sequel is the several ways it radically differs from the original : the tone is grim and morbid rather than spooky and moody , the violence is more graphic and plentiful , and there's even a chilling explanation provided for Myers ' personal vendetta against Laurie ( WARNING : Possible SPOILER ahead . She's his long lost sister , which makes Myers desire to kill her that much more scary and disturbing ) . The last third of the film makes for a harrowing ordeal and things wrap up on a beautifully haunting closing note ( the inspired use of " Mr . Sandman " helps out a lot here ) . Dean Cundey's typically polished and agile gliding cinematography rates as another substantial asset . Overall , it's a fine and enjoyable sequel to the superior ' 78 seasonal slasher classic .
Good'n'gory Grade B horror monster splatter fun	Your standard motley assortment of folks in a small remote tavern find themselves under attack by a ferocious family of foul and deadly carnivorous subhuman monsters . That's basically it for the admittedly skimpy plot , but luckily what we got here is a pleasingly straightforward and unpretentious rough'n'ready Grade B low-budget fright flick that gets right down to exciting brass tacks and delivers a handy helping of the lowdown funky'n'junky goods with infectiously full-throttle brio . Director John Gulager keeps the breakneck pace nonstop throughout , creates a reasonably tense and creepy atmosphere , and pours on the graphic gore with joyously gruesome abandon ( both limbs and heads get torn off , plus one dude has his noggin crushed like a giant squishy grape and the horrible beasts even eat a little boy ! ) . The game cast have a ball with their generic stock parts : Balthazar Getty as an arrogant loudmouth pool hustler , Navi Rawat as the tough , gutsy heroine , Henry Rollins as an inane , ineffectual motivational speaker , Duane Whitacker as a redneck lout , Jason Mewes as himself ( he gets bumped off early in the action ) , Judah Friedlander as a pathetic dorky loser , Josh Zuckerman as a spunky cripple , Krista Allen as a scrappy waitress , Jenny Wade as a perky bar maid , and Clu Gulager as a craggy , weary bartender are all a great deal of fun to watch . Moreover , the cool monsters ( thankfully not CGI ; instead they're guys in nifty elaborate suits ) , Thomas L . Callaway's sharp , gritty , lively cinematography , the brash humor ( the snappy character bios are hilarious and the startling monster sex scene is a raunchy hoot ) , and Steve Edwards ' spooky'n'shuddery score are all on the money excellent . Good , trashy low-grade horror creature feature fun .
An enjoyable 50's zombie horror picture	A zombie captain and crew guard the treasure of a sunken ship . A motley assortment of scavengers risk their lives to retrieve the fortune in diamonds hidden inside the vessel . Competently directed by Edward L . Cahn , this endearingly hokey low-budget horror flick moves along at a reasonable clip and offers a fair amount of creepy atmosphere . The underwater scenes are especially tense and gripping . The excellent cast of familiar 50's B-movie faces adds greatly to the silly fun : Gregg Palmer as hunky , stalwart diver Jeff Clark , Allison Hayes as the snippy Mona Harrison , Morris Ankrum as the sage , friendly Dr . Jonathan Eggert , Autumn Russell as the sweet Jan Peters , Joel Ashley as the gruff George Harrison , Marjorie Eaton as the wise Grandmother Peters , and Gene Roth as Sam the chauffeur . Benjamin H . Kline's dark , moody cinematography and Mischa Bakaleinikoff's shuddery'n'spooky score are both solid and effective . An entertaining fright feature .
A very cool and enjoyable 80's teen gang romp	" Class of 1984 " meets " High Noon " and subsequently gets transposed to the blighted , crime-ridden East Los Angeles ghetto area in this really solid and effective teen gang opus . A vicious street gang called the Cobras holds a reign of terror over Lincoln High School . Stand-up , no-nonsense tough guy Jeff Hanna ( a commanding and believable performance by " My Bodyguard " ' s hulking Adam Baldwin ) quits the Cobras and decides he wants to live a normal , peaceful life . Alas , Jeff incurs the formidable wrath of savage , vengeful Cobra leader Cinco ( a perfectly vile Danny De La Paz ) when he refuses to take a dive for Cinco during a surprise police drug bust . So Cinco vows that he's gonna clean Jeff's clock but good come 3 : 15 after school , clinching the odds that Jeff will definitely show up for this lethal rumble by beating up Jeff's sweet newfound girlfriend Sherry ( an endearing turn by the lovely , cuddly Deborah Foreman ) . Granted , the plot provided by Sam Bernard and Michael Jacobs ' blunt , no-frills , just cover all the necessary bases and nothing more script doesn't offer any fresh insights or novel twists on a timeworn Western-style big showdown premise . However , Larry Gross ' precise , straightforward direction , Gary Chang's neatly percolating score , Misha Suslov's slick , smoothly gliding cinematography , a refreshing lack of pretense , and a thrilling finale with Jeff opening up a king-sized dose of raw , bloody hurting on the Cobras more than compensates for the dearth of originality . Plus , the supporting cast is totally up to snuff : " Benson " ' s Rene Auberjonois as the school's manipulative Machiavellian principal , Ed Lauter as a cynical , world-weary cop , Wings Hauser as Sherry's overprotective jerk dad , Mario Van Peebles as a black gang leader , 80's horny teen regular Scott McGinnis in one of his standard smart-mouthed wiseguy roles , Joseph Brutsman as Jeff's loyal nerdy pal Marvin , and future " Showgirls " hottie Gina Gershon as a snarly Cobra gang moll . All in all , this flick's certainly punchy and violent enough to make the grade as a satisfying item .
A terrifically tough and sleazy thriller	Successful self-made married businessman Harry Mitchell ( a superbly steely performance by Roy Scheider ) has an adulteress fling with sweet'n'sexy young stripper Cini ( the gorgeous Kelly Preston ) . Harry's blackmailed by a trio of scummy low-life hoods - - sleazy porno theater manager Raimy ( a splendidly slimy John Glover ) , antsy strip joint owner Leo ( well played by Robert Trebor ) and crazed pimp Bobby Shy ( a frightfully intense Clarence Williams III ) - - who have videotaped his affair with Cini . When Harry refuses to pay up , the hoods kill Cini and make it look like Harry did it . This in turn ignites a dangerous battle of wit and wills between Harry and the hoods . Director John Frankenheimer , adopting a tough script based on Elmore Leonard's gritty crime thriller novel , expertly maintains a steady snappy pace , delivers plenty of gripping tension , and effectively creates a compellingly seedy'n'sordid atmosphere . The leads are all uniformly excellent , with stand-out supporting turns by Ann-Margret as Harry's bitter neglected wife Barbara , Vanity as brash jaded prostitute Doreen , and Lonny Chapman as Harry's loyal business partner Jim O'Boyle . The tight'n'twisty plot keeps viewers on their toes throughout . The wickedly profane dialogue , Jost Vacano's glossy cinematography , Gary Chang's stirring score , the harshly amoral tone and the rousing conclusion are all likewise on the money as well . As an added bonus , both Vanity and Preston take their clothes off . A very strong and satisfying little number that's well worth checking out .
A solid and seriously underrated sleeper	Loosely based on Vicki Lawrence's notoriously trashy country story song , this unexpectedly amiable and engrossing dramatic feature about ordinary small-time dreamers who aspire to greater things in life makes for a perfectly nice and affecting character-oriented slice-of-everyday-life affair , specifically centering on how going for the gold in life takes a lot of courage and determination . Dennis Quaid portrays his part with a winningly scruffy , roguish charm ; he's a reckless ne'er-do-well womanizing hellion striving to make it big in Nashville as a country singer . Kristy McNichol is likewise on the money , radiating her usual spunky appeal as Quaid's headstrong , ambitious and highly precocious 16-year-old sister who acts as Quaid's manager and does her best to keep her wayward brother in line . The duo's major league plans go astray when Quaid runs afoul of belligerent sticksville town sheriff Don Stroud . Quaid , Stroud and McNicol all give fine performances , but it's Mark Hamill who takes the acting honors with his shockingly good turn as the decent , sympathetic state trooper who befriends McNicol and falls in love with her . Director Ronald F . Maxwell shows a lovely , uplifting sure feel for these hugely endearing commonplace individuals , depicting their mundane lives and go-for-the-glory aspirations without the slightest whiff of cheap sentiment or condescension . Moreover , the country music score totally cooks , with both Quaid and McNicol contributing a few surprisingly up-to-par tunes ( yes , they both sing - - and extremely well , too ! ) . Granted , this flick ain't without its flaws : the meandering opening third starts off pretty shaky and the tragic ending is abrupt and dissatisfying . But overall this unjustly overlooked picture rates as a real sleeper .
A pleasingly sleazy 70's cheerleader romp	The 70's cheerleader teen sexploitation sub-genre receives an appropriately sleazy send-off with this satisfyingly tacky effort . The plot is slight , but serviceable enough : three bitter disgruntled former high school football star athletes along with one jock's dippy younger brother and a ruthless lesbian school nurse abduct a bus full of beautiful bimbo cheerleaders . Okay , the story ain't much and the film itself plays out as more of a tense , straightforward suspense thriller rather than the expected goofy innocuous comic romp , but the flick's exemplary trash picture credentials alone make it a worthy addition to this nifty sub-genre . Producer William Osco previously cranked out numerous porno features and later made the enjoyably atrocious toxic waste monster clinker " The Being . " Jason Williams , the star of the immortal X-rated sci-fi outing " Flesh Gordon , " portrays the hunky head kidnapper . " The Hills Have Eyes " survivors Robert Houston and Janus Blythe are reunited here . " Penitentiary " series star Leon Isaac Kennedy appears acting under the alias Lee Curtis as a disc jockey ( in real life Kennedy worked as a disc jockey prior to embarking on an acting career ! ) . The cheerleaders are played by such scrumptious , often undraped seasoned junk flick veterans as Kristine DeBell ( star of the hard-core fairytale offering " Alice in Wonderland " ) , Elizabeth Halsey ( the dirty soft-core musical version of " Cinderella " ) , Wally Anne Wharton ( " Up in Smoke " ) , Lenka Novak ( " Coach , " " Vampire Hookers " ) , Tracy Ann King ( a . k . a . Marilyn Joi , " Hammer , " " The Kentucky Fried Movie " ) , and Janie Squire ( the skinny-dipper who gets munched at the start of " Piranha " ) . Jeff Werner's capable direction doesn't skimp on the good stuff : there's more gratuitous nudity than you can shake a pom-pom at , lots of gleefully gross lowbrow humor ( the cheerleaders tie all their panties together so they can trip one of their abductors ! ) , a splendidly stinky pseudo-disco score , a tasty lengthy topless beauty contest , pot smoking , hideously bad soft-rock songs , garish cinematography , and an absolute dearth of taste , subtlety and artistic refinement . In short , it's a solid piece of blithely low-grade and hence quite entertaining schlock .
A fun 50's sci-fi romp	Kindly , but sad and lonely doll maker Mr . Franz ( an excellent performance by John Hoyt ) shrinks some folks to miniature size so he cam have some company . His latest victims are affable salesman Bob Westley ( 50's science fiction film regular John Agar in fine form ) and sweet secretary Sally Reynolds ( a charming turn by lovely blonde June Kenney ) . Bob , Sally and four other diminutive people try to find a way to get out of the clutches of the benign , yet deranged Franz . Director Bert I . Gordon relates the engrossing premise at a steady pace and maintains a generally serious tone throughout . George Worthington Yates ' surprisingly thoughtful script offers a poignant portrait of how loneliness can drive someone crazy . This film further benefits from solid acting by a sturdy cast : Hoyt brings a moving blend of pathos and sympathy to his credible portrayal of Franz , Agar and Kenney make for highly engaging leads , plus there's bang-up support from Jack Kosslyn as the hard-nosed Sergeant Paterson , Michael Mark as friendly puppeteer Emil , Marlene Willis as spunky , adorable teenager Laurie , Ken Miller as the laid-back Stan , Laurie Mitchell as the sassy Georgia Lane , Scott Peters as the easygoing Mac , and Gordon's adorable daughter Susan as a cute girl scout with a broken doll . Ernest Laszlo's crisp black and white cinematography does the trick . The roaring dramatic score is likewise up to par . The huge props and sets are quite good . The special effects are pretty decent , if a tad on the chintzy side . Moreover , this movies delivers a few amusingly campy moments : Laurie serenades Franz with the catchy song " You're My Living Doll " and Georgia takes a bath in a big coffee can . An enjoyable picture .
A hilariously horrible all-star Canadian disaster hoot	This uproariously absurd Canadian disaster ( semi ) epic centers on an unspecified metropolis ( Chicago ? New York ? Los Angeles ? ) catching aflame after a bitter oil refinery worker ( grossly overplayed by Jonathan Walsh ) pours fuel in the city's sewers that in turn gets set alight by two welders working in said sewer ( ! ) . Next thing you know the whole city becomes an incendiary inferno and people are getting fried left and right . Trapped inside a hospital in the middle of the blaze are dull doctor Barry Newman ( whose once smokin ' hot career promptly ran out of gas following his sterling portrayal of Kowalski in the car chase cult classic " Vanishing Point " ) , haggard-looking nurse Shelley Winters ( who suffered a heart attack during " The Poseidon Adventure " and meets a similar abrupt fate here ) , and corner-cutting mayor Leslie Nielsen ( who also got killed during " The Poseidon Adventure ; " who was the casting director on this flick ? ) . Trying to contain the fire and save countless human lives is stern , no-nonsense fire chief Henry Fonda ( the President in " Meteor " ) . Clumsily directed with an appalling lack of skill and finesse by Alvin Rakoff ( who went on to fumble with the equally inept " Death Ship " ) , with a totally implausible script co-written by none other than Jack Hill , this admittedly awful picture still counts as a great deal of cheesy fun thanks to terrible acting from a noticeably embarrassed Hall of Shame Faded Name cast ( Ava Gardner is pitiful as a boozy , bitchy TV news anchorwoman ; ditto James Franciscus as a harried television station manager ) , poor special effects ( both the miniatures and matte paintings are laughably pathetic ) , and hilariously horrendous dialogue ( groan-inducing gems include " Try talking to a surgeon about compromise during an open heart operation " and " Don't die on me for Christ's sake " ) . The single most unintentionally sidesplitting scene occurs when a drooling , deranged old bag gets turned into a human torch and cuts loose with an incredible high-pitched scream as she runs down a flame-engulfed street . And remember folks : " It can happen to any city anywhere ! "
A twisted horror splatter ode to 80's VHS mania	Steven Emory ( the affable Art Neill ) runs a video rental outlet in a sleepy small New Jersey town . The unfriendly locals frequently watch gruesome horror movies . One day a customer leaves behind a videocassette with what appears to be an actual real filmed murder on it . When Steven decides to investigate matters on his own , he finds both himself and his loyal wife Rachel ( the charming Jackie Neill ) in considerable jeopardy . Director / co-writer Gary Cohen concocts a novel and involving story which puts a fresh and disturbing 80's VHS mania spin on the ever creepy and effective snuff movie premise . Moreover , Cohen does a good job of creating a bleak , mean-spirited tone and pours on the hideously nasty graphic gore with unflinching abandon . Philip Gary's competent cinematography likewise does the trick . The game no-name cast all give decent performances ; Bart Sumner and Uke ham it up with infectiously depraved aplomb as joyfully deranged wackos Howard and Eli . The surprise bummer ending concludes things on a pleasingly nihilistic note . Only the often plodding pace and one of those irritating overbearing and monotonous synthesizer scores detract a bit from this otherwise solid and satisfying micro-budget shot-on-video splatter winner .
An immensely funny and entertaining tongue-in-cheek low-budget horror anthology movie send-up	Fed-up B-horror scream queen Rebecca Raven ( a winningly spirited and self-deprecating performance by the adorable Misty Mundae ) gets sacked by the low-rent studio that regularly employs her . Raven goes to a remote house in the country to rest while sleazeball hack director Frank ( a deliciously smarmy Michael R . Thomas ) looks for a new starlet to replace her . First and most amusing yarn , " Mecharachnia " - A couple of mischievous tiny aliens terrorize down-on-his-luck junkyard owner Jed Callahan ( amiable Rob Monkiewicz ) and his feisty ex-girlfriend Linda ( foxy brunette spitfire Caitlin Ross ) . This segment boasts some very funky old school-style stop-motion animation special effects , with a towering makeshift monster made out of spare car parts rating as the definite highlight . Second and most inspired story , " Zombie This " - Raven has to tap into her experience as a veteran schlock horror actress after she accidentally resurrects a shambling zombie ( Duane Polcou in nifty make-up ) . It's a real treat to watch Mondae parody her trash pic goddess persona ( she even takes an obligatory nude bath ) and get tough as she kicks some pesky undead butt . Third and most outrageous story , " Lonely Are the Brain " - Crazy mad scientist Dr . Carruthers ( nicely played by the luscious Julian Wells ) uses a handful of lovely young ladies in a home for wayward women as guinea pigs in dangerous experiments conducted for an evil giant brain with an insatiable hunger for erotic pleasure . It's up to brassy take-charge lass Naomi ( a strong and sympathetic turn by the yummy AJ Khan ) to stop Carruthers . This wonderfully warped affair offers a deliriously intoxicating mix of tasty female nudity , kinky soft-core sex , and trippy , surreal , nightmarish visuals . Writer / director Brett Piper maintains a brisk pace throughout and does a fine job of creating a playfully macabre atmosphere . Moreover , the enthusiastic cast have an absolute ball with their juicy roles and Jon Greathouse supplies a delightfully campy Danny Elfmanesque rollicking ooga-booga score . A great deal of blithely goofy fun .
Nifty martial arts mortality tale	Decent , honest , simple Chinese country farmhand and ace martial artist Tai-Lin ( a fine and likable performance by Jason Pai Piao ) goes to a big city in the Phillippines to seek his fortune . Tai-Lin befriends scruffy petty street hoodlum Siao-Mao ( amusingly played to the wormy hilt by Ruel Vernal ) and gets a job as a dock worker . When Tai-Lin discovers that the people he works for are part of a crime syndicate that specializes in smuggling opium , he quits his job and joins forces with both fierce black boxer Ron Van Clief and equally formidable Filipino boxer Jorge Estraga against the evil organization . Director Chin-Ku Lu tells the serious and compelling story about morality , integrity and corruption in an effectively plain and straightforward manner while maintaining a snappy pace throughout and staging the plentiful rock ' em , rock ' em chopsocky fisticuffs with considerable aplomb . Moreover , Lu manages to add a few poignant moments amid all the expected stirring kung-fu carnage ; the relationship between Tai-Lin and Siao-Mao is quite warm and touching . Piao makes for a very strong and appealing protagonist as the naive and innocent Tai-Lin ; he receives sound support from Nancy Veronica as the sweet Ching Kwei , Thompson Kao Kong as Tai-Lin's smug , slick , arrogant hotshot successful brother Chi-Fu-Shi , and Subas Herrero as a smarmy flunky for the bad guys . The neatly varied score alternates between sappy orchestral mush and jaunty hillbilly bluegrass ( complete with fiddle and banjo ! ) . The big showdown between our heroes and the villains is very lively and exciting . A cool little movie .
An immensely entertaining Italian rip-off of " First Blood "	Noble Native American Thunder ( likable Mark Gregory ; Trash in " 1990 : The Bronx Warriors " ) returns to his small desert home town only to discover that an ancient Indian burial ground is being demolished by construction workers . Thunder tries to stop them to no avail . He gets beat up and run out of town but returns to further stir things up . Next thing you know Thunder is on the lam and being doggedly hunted in the wilderness by a posse led by hard-nosed Sheriff Bill Cook ( the always fine Bo Svenson ) . Sound familiar ? Yep , this low-budget Italian movie blatantly copies the superior Sylvestor Stallone vehicle " First Blood . " Fortunately , director / co-writer Fabrizio De Angelis compensates for the dearth of originality by expertly maintaining a ceaseless breakneck pace throughout . Moreover , De Angelis stages the plentiful action scenes with rip-roaring brio ( a wild car chase rates as the definite exciting highlight ) . Sergio Salvati's handsome , expansive cinematography , Francesco De Masi's rousing , tuneful , majestic score , the occasional snazzy use of strenuous slow motion , and the breathtaking Monument Valley locations are all up to speed . Nice supporting turns by Raimund Harmstorf as the jerky , antagonistic Deputy Barry Henson , Antonio Sabato as the zealously wicked troublemaker Thomas , Valeria Ross as the feisty Sheila , Paolo Malco as pesky TV reporter Brain Sherman , and Michele Mirabella as groovy disc jockey Dancing Crow . While it's no classic , this fast'n'furious little Grade B action item still makes the grade as a fun and thrilling flick all the same .
A really enjoyable 70's drive-in romp	Three nubile young prison inmates - - fiery Carrie ( slinky blonde Jillian Kesner ) , sassy Chicago ( lovely eyeful Janice Heiden ) , and fragile Mitzi ( foxy brunette June Fairchild ) - - are chosen for an unorthodox college study on human behavior that's being conducted by shrink Professor Blalock ( a solid turn by Warren Stevens ) . Unbeknownst to the gals , they are really being used as guinea pigs for an experimental drug that causes all of them to become more exceedingly hostile and unstable : Mitzi steals a giant stuffed penguin from a toy store display window , Chicago becomes aggressively libidinous , and Carrie suddenly develops a moral conscience . Ably directed with flair to spare by underrated 70's B-movie master Gus ( " Nashville Girl " ) Trikonis , with a pleasing plenitude of tasty distaff nudity , a smidgen of soft-core sex , several cool set pieces ( highlights include a rough'n'tumble catfight in an all-girls juvenile penitentiary , a rowdy pool party , and a smoky back alley high stakes craps game ) , a tight'n'trim 75 minute running time , profane dialogue , a pertinent central message about the dangers of unethical unregulated drug testing , and a winningly raunchy sense of breezy'n'easy irreverent humor , this flick serves up loads of infectiously trashy grindhouse fun . The three lady leads are hot , sexy and attractive ( Fairchild in particular is absolutely adorable ) , plus they all are pretty capable actresses . This movie further benefits from spirited acting by an enthusiastic supporting cast : Peter Hooten as Blalock's hunky nice guy son Carter , Judith Roberts as the shrewish Ms . Blalock , Vic Jolley as the girls ' uptight guardian Vernon , David Ankrum as the nerdy Leroy , and Faith Barnhart as the snippy Sharon . The always reliable Gary Graver's typically proficient cinematography does the trick . The groovy 70's cop show-style disco score by Don Bagley and Steve Michaels likewise hits the funky spot . A hugely entertaining and unjustly overlooked exploitation blast .
An excellent , engrossing and unjustly forgotten 70's prison drama sleeper	One of the best , most grimly realistic and , alas , very neglected and under-appreciated 70's prison films , a meticulously detailed and unflinching portrait of the harsh , rigidly set and strictly enforced caste system which exists within your average penitentiary . Thomas Waites gives a fine , sturdy , quietly menacing performance as Chilly , a brutal , cagey , ruthless top con who governs over a Staten Island calaboose's black market with the proverbial iron fist . John Heard delivers a strikingly excellent and appealing turn as a shy , soft-spoken wife killer who winds up locking horns with Waites after he borrows cigarettes from him without paying for them first . Lane Smith ( Nick Nolte's sympathetic cell mate in the lovely drama " Weeds " and the nasty authoritarian warden in the superior supernatural revenge horror picture " Prison " ) as the hard-nosed security captain , Joe Grafasi as a timid , browbeaten inmate , Richard Bright ( Al Neri in the " Godfather " movies ) as a shrewd , sneaky top con determined to knock Waites off his throne , and a young James Remar in his film debut as a surly punk kid lend top notch support . But the guy who clearly makes off with the entire feature is Mike Kellin , an always outstanding heavy-set , craggy-faced character actor who never received his full due . Kellin's terrific , touching , wistfully funny portrayal of Red , an amiable , but pretty imbecilic elderly felon who's been in the joint for so long that he's completely lost sync with the outside world and thus will forever remain behind bars for life , radiates a frail yearning and wounded hangdog humanity that's simply a wonder to behold . The scene where Red makes a game , albeit futile attempt at persuading the parole board to spring him rates as a tragicomic gem ; it's both sadly affecting and wryly amusing at the same time - - and it's followed by an extraordinarily moving moment of devastating heartbreak that's made all the more poignant by being presented with commendable taste , subtlety and understatement . Raphael D . Silver's tough , steady , laudable direction , aided by Alan Metzger's silvery , velvety cinematography and Charles Gross ' haunting , low-key , melancholy jazz score , forcefully renders a properly grim , desolate and credibly down'n'dirty jailhouse milieu . Only the somewhat rambling and occasionally scattershot narrative and an incongruously light-hearted finale fail to fully pass muster . Those faults aside , " On the Yard " overall cuts it as a gritty , hard-hitting , totally absorbing and convincing guys doin ' time sleeper .
A satisfyingly sleazy Cheri Caffaro 70's drive-in trash movie treat	Buxom , leggy , shapely , irresistibly trashy platinum blonde 70's schlock action movie bombshell Cheri Caffaro , who rather uncomfortably resembles a cheap dime-store Dolly Parton clone , struts her electrifying el skanko woman hot stuff to the sizzling low-rent max as cagey , sexy and very deadly international hit babe Samantha Fox ( who shouldn't be confused with either the New York porn star or the vacuous British pop singer ) , who's armed with an assortment of lethal weapons and clever disguises , plus sports the world's ugliest dark blue eye shadow and an extremely deep all body tan . Fox gleefully kills an eminently hateful bunch of wealthy slimebags ( my personal favorite is the sadomasochistic B & D leather freak Cheri smothers by putting a plastic bag over his head after she ties the sicko up ) who all live in the Phillipines . She's been hired to rub out these evil rich scum by some mystery person . In between offing people Cheri finds time to strike up a steamy romance with hunky police chief Aharon Ipale ( one particularly hot date involves attending a cockfight ; the killer roosters ' wild brawl is tastefully inter-cut with scorchingly hot shots of a naked Caffaro excitedly writhing on a bed ! ) . Cheri's perpetually all-thumbs director husband Don Schain , who also helmed all three sensationally scuzzy " Ginger " pictures and the tawdry " A Place Called Today " for his darling celluloid sleaze goddess wife , fumbles the ball here with truly inept , but still oddly engrossing and often painfully sidesplitting results : some priceless dialogue ( aphorism to live by : " I never bet on anything but a sure thing " ) , copious gratuitous Caffaro nudity , hilariously ham-fisted action scenes ( don't miss the gut-busting karate fight between Cheri and a would-be kung-fu assassin on Cheri's yacht ) , Hugo Montenegro's funky , pulsating pseudo-John Barry score , choppy editing , quite primitive cinematography by Fredy Conde ( the strenuous slow motion and eyeball-straining four way split screen are both endearingly clumsy ) , gorgeous scenic Manila locations , an almost excruciatingly funny surprise ending , Julie McFadden's haunting rendition of the unforgettably atrocious theme song " Lady Samantha " ( " Lady Samantha / He fell in love with you " ) , and the incomparable Vic Diaz's marvelous portrayal of a sweet , tubby , gluttonous blundering oaf of a detective all jostle for the viewer's attention in this tacky , degenerate and resolutely crummy ersatz James Bond-style action / adventure dreckfest released by New World Pictures that's absolutely essential viewing for any self-respecting Cheri Caffaro fan worth his weight in crushed beer cans , which hopefully doesn't exclude too many folks .
An amusingly silly tongue-in-cheek gay biker romp	This flick sure ain't your run of the mill biker exploitation item . The biker gang in this highly peculiar picture are a bunch of openly swishy and flamboyant homosexuals who encounter various forms of harassment and prejudice while embarking on a road trip to a Los Angeles drag convention . During their merry trek our endearingly campy protagonists get hassled by the cops , have a run-in with a hostile rival heterosexual biker club , eat a fancy lunch on the side of the road , engage in a food fight at a roadside hot dog stand , and try on dresses at a clothing store . Director Larry Brown and screenwriter Margaret McPherson treat this gleefully lowbrow nonsense with an appropriately lighthearted touch , maintain a zippy pace throughout , and keep things way too inane for this movie to ever seem even remotely offensive . Sure , the titular bunch are depicted as broad limp-wristed queenie stereotypes , but they're also the most affable and appealing characters in the entire feature . Moreover , the actors who portray this jolly group play their parts with delicious eye-rolling gusto : John Alderman as tough , scruffy leader Michael , Tom Basham as the effeminate David , Bruce Kimball as temperamental hulk Arnold , Henry Olek as dandyish Brit-accented aspiring poet Edward , Maurice Warfield as the mincing Ronnie , and Robert Biheller as the equally epicene Henry . Plus familiar B-movie regulars Michael Pataki and Dan Haggerty appear as belligerent straight bikers . The soundtrack of insanely groovy songs hits the funky spot . Michael Weyman's sunny cinematography likewise does the trick . The totally unexpected surprise downbeat ending packs a pretty strong and lingering punch . A real nutty one-of-a-kind vintage 70's grindhouse hoot .
A deliciously sick and deviant early 80's summer camp slasher flick	Shy , repressed teenage girl Angela ( winningly played by Felissa Rose ) makes her first trip to Camp Arawak with her nephew Ricky ( the solid Jonathan Tiersten ) . Several mean teens at the camp start to mercilessly pick on Angela . Before you can say " here we go again , " the body count starts to mount , with a handful of folks getting bumped off in assorted gruesome ways . Could it be Angela or someone else who's committing these horrible murders ? While the basic plot is obviously derived both " Carrie " and " Friday the 13th " alike , this satisfyingly grim early 80's low-budget slice'n'dice item still cuts it as good'n'ghoulish slasher fun thanks to Robert Hiltzik's strong direction and a suitably sick , perverse and twisted script . Moreover , this movie plausibly depicts adolescents as cruel , selfish and fiercely competitive little monsters . The make-up f / x by Ed French are top-notch and each grisly murder is creative in its own macabre way : A portly , repulsive pedophile cook has his face severely burned with scalding hot water , a jerk drowns under a boat , another dork is stung to death by wasps , a bimbo gets knifed in the shower , a vicious floozy's face gets roasted by an electric curling iron , three kids are hacked up with a hatchet , and the same hatchet is used for a decapitation . WARNING : Major SPOILER ahead . Plus there's one startling doozy of a shock surprise ending : Angela turns out to be a boy who was raised by his wacko aunt ( delightfully overplayed to the campy wacko hilt by Desiree Gould ) to believe that he's a girl instead . This conclusion was later shamelessly copied in " The Crying Game . " Craggy-faced character actor Mike Kellin turns in a fine performance as Mel , the irate , cigar-chomping camp owner who tries to cover up the murders and ultimately winds up having an arrow shot through his neck . This nasty nugget was followed by two entertaining tongue-in-cheek sequels , but the original remains the best of the bunch .
A hugely enjoyable tongue-in-cheek British horror anthology hoot	Psychiatrist Dr . R . C . Tremayne ( the always fine Donald Pleasence ) and colleague Dr . Nicholas ( Jack Hawkins in his final film role ) investigate the case histories of four inmates being kept in an experimental asylum . 1st and most whimsical tale , " Mr . Tiger " - Little boy Paul Patterson ( cute Russell Lewis ) can't convince his constantly bickering parents ( played to snarky perfection by Georgia Brown and Donald Houston ) that his " imaginary " tiger friend is actually real . 2nd and most offbeat yarn , " Penny Farthing " - Timothy Patrick ( likable Peter McEnery ) purchases an antique bicycle which enables him to go back in time to the Victorian era where he meets fair maiden Beatrice ( the extremely charming and comely Suzy Kendall ) . 3rd and most perverse segment , " Mel " - Jeolous , possessive housewife Bella Thompson ( the ever classy and lovely Joan Collins ) becomes really upset when her husband Brian ( solid Michael Jayston ) becomes infatuated with a sensuous , but lethal sentient tree ( ! ) . 4th and most twisted vignette , " Luau " - Stuck-up rich lady Auriol Pageant ( a wonderfully radiant Kim Novak ) holds a big bash in which the surprise ingredient in the meat turns out to be none other than her sweet virginal daughter Virginia ( the stunningly gorgeous Mary Tamm ) . Director Freddie Francis , working from a witty and inspired script by British fright film scream queen Jennifer Jayne , handles the macabre material with his customary crisp and polished assurance , punctuating the grisly anecdotes with a nice , dry line in quirky black humor and offering up a fair amount of gore . Norman Warwick's slick , sparkling cinematography gives the picture an attractive glossy look . Bernard Ebbinghouse's alternately groovy and spooky score likewise scores a bull's eye . Deliciously droll fun .
A fun little semi-documentary on daredevils	Writer / director Mark Lester's immensely enjoyable Southern-fried 70's drive-in yarn spins the semi-autobiographical tale of Dusty Russell , a former moonshine runner turned acclaimed professional automobile daredevil who made his name jumping over an increasingly large number of cars in the traveling daredevil show " Circus of Death . " Russell's eagerness and fearlessness wins the respect and approval of his fellow daredevils with the exception of jealous washed-up has-been Dangerous Dan Carter , who sparks a bitter rivalry with Russell which leads to a tragic ending . Lester , who got his start making documentaries , relates this very basic and uncomplicated story in a spare , minimalist , unaffected verite style : John Arthur Morrill's plain cinematography , Don Tweedy's judiciously applied jaunty country folk score , the leisurely pacing , the relaxed , unmannered acting from a cast who mostly play themselves , and the straightforwardly presented daredevil stunts lend this picture a most disarming and effective quasi-documentary aura . The car stunts are every bit as exciting and nerve-rattling as they ought to be . The movie's vivid , evenly balanced portrait of the tight camaraderie , macho gamesmanship , occasional dreary lulls between shows and crazy feats of cocky daring-do that are significant components of the daredevil lifestyle neither glorifies nor vilifies said lifestyle . Real-life ace World Champion daredevils Russell , Carter , Buddy Love , Dutch " Atom Man " Schnitzer , Big Tim Welch , Speed Stearns ( who subsequently appeared in " Joyride to Nowhere " ) , and Ed " Chromedome " Ryan do their harrowing white-knuckle stunts with commendable bravery , while Gene Drew gives a funny , robust performance as the show's gruff , irascible , motor-mouthed owner ( Drew also acted in both " Truck Stop Women " and " Bobbie Jo and the Outlaw " for Lester ) . This breezy , amiable ode to bold , brash , red-blooded all-American male recklessness , restlessness , and gallantry would make an ideal double feature with the equally cool " Death Riders . "
A satisfyingly sleazy slice of Italian slasher trash	A murderous mystery maniac wearing a hood and cape brutally butchers staff and patients alike at a posh all female asylum run by Dr . Keller ( the one and only Klaus Kinski sporting modish long hair ) . Director Fernando Di Leo ( who also co-wrote the sordid script with Nino Latino ) really pours on the hardcore raunchy and explicit scuzziness in this alarmingly fetid flick , delivering extremely ample and explicit amounts of seamy sex and gory violence with jaw-dropping go-for-it slimy abandon . There's a real leering , nasty , rub-your-nose-in-the-filth grimy and graphic edge to this picture that's a terrifically trashy wonder to behold . Delectable brunette beauty Rosalba " The Devil's Wedding Night " Neri as the resident insatiable nympho ain't the least bit bashful about baring her sleek , shapely body in a much-appreciated steamy shower scene ; she later strips in order to seduce the hunky gardener and gets killed while writhing naked in bed . The equally tasty Margaret " Venus in Furs " Lee , Jane Garret , Monica Strebel , and Giora Desideri all likewise dutifully doff their duds in the name of gleefully lowbrow exploitation . Silvano Spadaccino's groovy score neatly alternates between funky , percussive prog-rock and lush orchestral jazz . Franco Villa's snazzy cinematography goes gloriously overboard with crazy tilted angles , sinuous prowling tracking shots and crude , shaky hand-held camera-work . The murder set pieces are every bit as bloody , vicious and sleazy as they ought to be . The seriously sick and twisted over-the-top nutty ending concludes things on a perfectly putrid note . Good lowdown gritty and unapologetically scroungy fun .
A superior early 80's " Friday the 13th " rip-off	One of the better " Friday the 13th " - inspired let's hack up a bunch of attractive young adults in a breathtaking remote sylvan setting slasher fright features to flood theaters in the early 80's . Not just content to emulate the basic story from that horror film hit , the screenwriters ( " Dead and Buried " scribe Ronald Shusett among ' em ) toss in elements of " Deliverance " and " The Texas Chainsaw Massacre " into the varied , yet still hugely derivative brew as well . Lack of originality aside , it's the very mixing of random bits and pieces from several different disparate sources that gives this honey a substantial lift out of the rut , especially when in a refreshing break from the wimpy dumb victim slice'n'dice norm the obligatory coed campers being terrorized by a wild , grubby , mangy-haired , murderous cannibalistic hermit hag band together into a mighty fighting force so they can kick the nasty old psycho biddy's ugly ill-kept a for putting them through sheer torturous hell . Yes , fellow theme freaks , this picture does indeed persuasively articulate a valid point about strength in numbers . Moreover , the film is made with praiseworthy polish and panache . Director Andrew Davis , who started out as a cinematographer-for-hire on such solid Grade B outings as Paul Bartel's " Private Parts , " " Cool Breeze , " " The Slams , " and " Mansion of the Doomed " before moving on to helm the more respectable mainstream blockbusters " Under Siege , " " The Fugitive , " and " A Perfect Murder , " keeps the pace barreling along at a speedy , steady clip , successfully evokes a frightfully palpable sense of ambient , ever-present and expansive backwoods danger and menace , and manages to create a sizable amount of nerve-jangling tension . Davis ' sharp , crisp , strikingly slick and handsome photography also hits the spot ; ditto the fluid , smooth editing by Paul Rubell and Erica Flaum and Susan Justin's spooky , shivery , crackling guitar feedback-drenched score . The cast come through with uniformly sound performances : John Friedrich cuts an impressively rugged and unnerving figure as a crazed , truculent , take charge ' Nam vet , classy British beauty Rachel Ward and the eternally yummy Daryl Hannah make for highly delectable damsels in distress , Mark Metcalf , Adrian Zmed and Lewis Smith are solid and engaging as trainee forest rangers who get a harrowing on the job education on the essential rudiments for survival , and Joe Pantoliano goons it up something spazzy as an edgy , browbeaten , hot-tempered geekoid handyman . In fact , the uncommonly strong acting and production values are good enough to make the minimal body count , only moderate lashings of pretty mild gore , and extremely tame sex ( with no nudity ! ) both forgivable and acceptable .
A worthy and supremely creepy Italian horror shocker winner	A group of alleged Devil worshipers are killed by knights in medieval Europe . A large Gothic church is built over the site were the massacre took place . In the modern age the sealed crypt which keeps the ancient evil at bay gets broken . A motley assortment of folks find themselves trapped in the church with the deadly and diabolical demonic force . Director Michele Soavi relates the absorbing and unsettling story with tremendous flair and style ; Soavi delivers plenty of flesh-crawling jolts , offers up a striking wealth of truly disturbing images , adeptly creates and maintains a potently dark and brooding mood , and even comes through with a strong and provocative meditation on faith and religion . Renato Tafuri's sharp and agile cinematography is positively breathtaking with its frequent fluid tracking shots and expert use of a prowling Steadicam . The extremely spooky'n'shuddery score by Keith Emerson and Goblin further enhances the overall eerie atmosphere . The cast all give solid performances , with especially fine work by Tomas Arana as studious librarian Evan , Barbara Cupisi as fetching painter Lisa , Hugh Quarshie as the assertive Father Gus , Feodor Chapliapin , Jr . as a stern , cranky bishop , Giovanni Lombardo Radice as a timid priest , Asia Argento as cute , spunky , rebellious teenager Lotte , and Antonello Vitale as a vain , snippy bride . Moreover , there's a handy helping of gruesome splatter featured throughout : Grisly highlights include a man tearing his own heart out , another guy impaling himself on a jackhammer , a woman being run through with spikes , a hapless lass getting pulped by a speeding train , and an old lady using her husband's severed head to ring a bell . Nice ambiguous ending , too .
A deliciously sordid 60s soft-core sleazefest	A psychiatrist treats a bevy of lovely , but deviant female patients . Said patients are a pretty messed-up bunch . Sadist Vickie derives sick kicks from beating up guys and then tying them up . Unhappily married Sherry is addicted to engaging in dirty sex with total strangers . Insatiable teenage nympho Kathy just can't get enough . Married couple Fred and Janet enjoy having a threesome with lesbian Barbara . Director George Rodgers , working from a trashy script by Martin Lathrop , delivers plenty of in-your-face explicit nudity and really raunchy soft-core sex . A heavy-handed narrator babbles incessantly about the girls ' severe sexual hang-ups . H . M . Schultz's rough , grainy black and white photography greatly adds to the pervasive seediness . Arthur Lindsey's wild free-form jazz score likewise does the groovy trick . The wonderfully wretched theme song is downright hilarious . Best of all , the women look quite attractive and aren't the least bit bashful about showing off their nice natural naked bodies at pleasingly regular intervals . Moreover , there's all kinds of seamy carnal activity on display throughout . A satisfyingly scuzzy slice of pure unadulterated junk .
An amusingly awful piece of chopsocky schlock	An evil drug cartel uses vampires to ensure that they retain their power . Some guy wearing a motorcycle helmet who looks like he's wrapped in tin foil - - he resembles a poor man's Inframan - - battles said vampires . Meanwhile criminal mastermind Steven Cox gets sprung from the joint and tries to hook back up with wicked duplicitous former moll Mary ( the ever lovely and graceful Angela Mao ) . Got that ? Well , I'm still not quite sure I got the insanely incoherent plot right , but this ridiculous rambling mess is nonetheless very entertaining in its nonstop jaw-dropping absurdity . For starters , those aforementioned vampires are clearly a bunch of dudes sporting tacky greasepaint make-up and a mouthful of cheap plastic fangs . Plus they can be controlled by sticking a piece of paper to their foreheads ! The wild martial arts fight scenes with these hopping freaks wreaking all kinds of crazy havoc are absolutely sidesplitting . The alarmingly atrocious scenery-gnashing acting provides a wealth of unintentional laughs as well . Ditto the expected hilariously horrendous dubbing . But what really clinches this baby's status as a total schlock hoot is the way it haphazardly tosses together two separate pictures into a single incredibly inane composite feature . It's by no means a good film , but it's definitely a great deal of always enjoyable and often uproarious goofy fun all the same .
A delightfully lively and witty giant monster on the loose horror creature feature treat	A 36-foot giant lethal mutant alligator that's the net result of 12 years of eating animal corpses with an experimental growth hormone in them which have been illegally dumped in the sewers by a nefarious big corporation comes above ground and goes on the expected grisly people-noshing spree in Chicago in this delightfully spirited tongue-in-cheek horror creature feature treat . Director Lewis Teague ( who went on to do the superior Stephen King adaptations " Cujo " and " Cat's Eye " ) , working from a wonderfully witty script by the ever-dependable John ( " Piranha , " " The Howling " ) Sayles , crafts one dandy little low-budget fright film winner , expertly maintaining a swift , unflagging pace throughout , creating a suitably creepy atmosphere for the subterranean sewer sequences , tossing in a few sly in-jokes ( one of the alligator's victims is a sewer worker named Ed Norton ! ) , and staging the ' gator attack scenes with considerable aplomb ( gory highlights include a little boy getting chomped by the bloodthirsty beastie and one luckless guy who has his legs from the knees down bitten off by the killer critter ) . The always excellent and engaging Robert Forster makes for a hugely likable lead as the rugged obsessive cop determined to bag the reptilian menace , with equally fine supporting performances by Robin Riker as a spunky herpetologist who helps Forster out , the gravel-voiced Michael Gazzo as a gruff police chief , Dean Jagger as a crooked CEO , Bart Braverman as an obnoxiously pushy tabloid reporter , Sue Lyon and Angel Tompkins as TV anchorwomen , Jack Carter as the jerky corrupt mayor , Sydney Lassick as an amiable pet store owner , and Perry Lang as Forster's ill-fated eager beaver rookie partner . Although all these folks turn in first-rate work , the top acting honors easily go to Henry Silva , who hilariously sends up his macho screen image as a cocky and racist big game hunter who more than meets his match in the ravenous over-sized monster . Moreover , the special effects are actually pretty good and the alligator itself qualifies as a truly cool creature . All in all , this baby sizes up as a whole lot of refreshingly breezy and unpretentious straightforward B-horror fun .
A delectably dreadful doozy	Bickering couple Norman ( stolid Corveth Ousterhouse ) and Leilla ( pretty blonde Shirley Bonne ) find themselves hopelessly lost in some remote rural region . They seek assistance from deranged redneck farmer Greely ( a game performance from beefy veteran exploitation picture regular Bill Thurman ) , who locks them both in a cave so he can feed them to his beloved pet lethal carnivorous reptilian humanoid monster ( also played by Thurman ) . Flatly directed by legendary Grade Z schlockmeister Larry Buchanan , with a dull , talky , uneventful script , a sluggish pace , cruddy , washed-out color cinematography by Robert B . Alcott , a tedious drawn-out flashback that's just tossed in to pad out the running time , a generic film library orchestral mush score , a simply pathetic some - poor - zhlub - in - a - lousy - rubbery - suit creature , no tension or momentum to speak of , and a spectacularly fumbled less-than-thrilling explosive conclusion , this hilariously horrendous hunk of unmitigated junk possesses all the right wrong stuff to qualify as a real four-star stinkeroonie . Former Disney kid thespian Tommy Kirk seems asleep on his feet as paleontologist hero Wayne Thomas while Annabelle MacAdams does her best with the thankless role of Greely's scared and abused housekeeper Bella . Moreover , the misty cavern setting is genuinely cool and creepy . A tasty slice of prime celluloid Velveeta cheese .
A fun sequel to the enjoyable original	Snarky Shirley Finnerty ( a nicely bitchy performance by luscious brunette Zoe Trilling ) and her friends from St . Rita's High School decide to have a Halloween party at the infamous Hull House . The kids find out that stories pertaining to the place being haunted are anything but silly or far-fetched . The malevolent spirit of Angela ( slinky Amelia Kinkade ) is still alive and ready to wreak some major league nasty havoc . Ably directed by seasoned Australian exploitation movie expert Brian Trenchard-Smith , with a suitably crude script by Joe Augustyn , plentiful gratuitous female nudity , a thrashin ' rock soundtrack , polished cinematography by David Lewis , a wild pull-out-the-stops last third , an amusingly campy sense of goofy humor , and a spooky score by Jim Manzie , this pictures makes for a pleasingly trashy tongue-in-cheek hoot . Moreover , the cast are all solid , with especially praiseworthy work from Jennifer Rhodes as the stern , but spunky Sister Gloria , Cristi Harris as the sweet , adorable Bibi , Merle Kennedy as Angela's timid sister Mouse , Bobby Jacoby as the nerdy Perry , Johnny Moran as the libidinous Johnny , Christine Taylor as yummy blonde Terri , Rod McCary as the uptight , skeptical Father Bob , and Darin Heames as the raucous Z-boy . In addition , Steve Johnson's excellent make-up f / x really deliver the grotesque goods ; grisly highlights include a slimy snake-like creature horribly violating a lovely young lass , a guy having his neck snapped , a juicy decapitation , a possessed dude's head melting after its drenched with holy water , and one fellow's severed noggin being used as a basketball . Plus the giant Angela humanoid snake monster which pops up at the end is genuinely gnarly . Sure , this flick definitely ain't no work of subtle and sophisticated art , but it's still perfectly entertaining nonsense just the same .
A wickedly funny black comedy hoot	Seemingly nice and mild-mannered suburbanite bachelor Harold Thompson ( splendidly played with jolly aplomb by George Wendt ) just wants to have the perfect family and will do anything to get it , including and especially murder . Lovely young Celia Fuller ( an appealing performance by the gorgeous Meredith Monroe0 and her husband David ( a solid Matt Keeslar ) move in next door . Harold singles out Celia as his next intended victim . Director John Landis , working from a wickedly clever and funny script by Brent Haley , deftly creates a pleasant small town world of cozy and polite normality that's right out of a corny sitcom . This in turn makes the more horrific elements that much more potent and jarring . The story is rife with nifty macabre touches ; Harold merrily listening to gospel music while assembling the skeletal remains of his victims in particular rates as a real hoot to watch . Moreover , the subtext about the severely messed-up insanity lurking underneath the rosy sweet surface of suburbia really hits home ( pun intended ) . The surprise twist ending is a total doozy . Jon Joffin's bright , pretty cinematography and Peter Bernstein's alternately jaunty and shivery score are both on the money excellent and effective . Best of all , George Wendt's remarkable portrayal of Harold offers a truly memorable psycho character who hides his genuine lethal and twisted nature behind a charming teddy bear veneer . A total treat .
An interesting and informative documentary on Edie Sedgwick	This short , but compelling and illuminating documentary interviews a handful of people who knew Edie Sedgwick during her fleeting , but eventful and memorable burst of fame in the 60's . Among the folks interviewed are Edie's supportive brother Jonathan , her loyal friend Richie Berlin , photographer Nat Finkelstein , art gallery curator Sam Green , record producer Danny Fields , fashion designer Betsey Johnson , artist Gerard Malanga , and " Factory Girl " writer / director George Hickenlooper . We learn that Sedgwick hailed from a wealthy , yet disturbed family ( two of her brothers committed suicide and her father might have had an incestuous relationship with her ) , had been institutionalized in sanitariums several times as a little girl , craved both fame and attention in order to compensate for the love she didn't receive as a kid , Andy Warhol basically used her as a means to an end to make himself a celebrity ( although Warhol essentially invented post-modernism , Edie was nonetheless instrumental in his success ) , had her own singular style , glamorous persona and sense of irresistible charisma that made her an automatic star ( she was also a terrific uninhibited dancer to boot ) , and her romance with Bob Dylan caused her relationship with Warhol to fall apart . Edie's subsequent disintegration beget by her drug addiction is frankly addressed . As one interviewee notes , one of Edie Sedgwick's fatal flaws was that she was a frail and vulnerable damaged soul who never asked anyone for help . A poignant and sobering portrait of the original 60's It girl who was quite possibly the first performance artist of her time .
A very lively and enjoyably over-the-top direct-to-video " Duel " variant	Boy , am I in the minority about this particular film . You see , I thought this movie was a lot of good , silly , rousing fun . Sure , it's a cheesy B-picture , but it does the trick and delivers the stirring goods , which makes it a solid film in my book . Okay , with that obligatory explanation stuff out of the way let's get on with this here review . After they accidentally cut off an ominous giant black pick-up truck on the highway , both dashing limousine driver Jim Travis ( firmly played by perennial straight-to-cable TV feature topliner Casper Van Dien ) and his fetching female passenger Sonia Walker ( the very cute Danielle Brett ) end up being relentlessly terrorized on an isolated patch of sticksville mountainside backroads by the pick-up's dangerously unbalanced and irritable wombat driver . Veteran director Sidney J . Furie tackles the admittedly trite " Duel " rehash material with commendable flair and aptitude , keeping the pace sprightly and unwavering throughout , creating a reasonable amount of tension , and staging several truly spectacular bash ' em , crash ' em and smash ' em up car chases and automobile stunts with smack dead on-target exciting results . Moreover , both leads turn in personable performances , the dialogue possesses real snap and wit , there are a few genuinely startling plot twists , the blaring rock score totally smokes , and , most importantly , we've got no pretense whatsoever to be found in a single fleet frame of this amazingly vigorous and galvanizing little beaut .
More infectiously dumb fun	Stuck-up snob Holly Wells ( a lively performance by the cuddly Ginger Lynn Allen ) and ditsy sweetheart Candy ( an endearingly daffy Elizabeth Kaitan ) can't stand each other , but are forced to work together in order to stop a gang of escaped female convicts lead by the wicked Melanie ( outrageously overplayed with eye-rolling hammy brio by Julia Parton ) . Things get worse when Melanie mutates into the crazed green-haired monster Malathion . Once again writer / director Rick Sloane gets plenty of cheap campy chuckles from such naturally knee-slapping subjects as lesbians in prison , mistaken identity , and excessive misuse and overuse of hairspray . The game cast really go to town on their broad roles : Allen and Kaitan make for a winningly sexy duo , Jay Richardson is a total riot as the arrogant , yet blundering commissioner , Johanna Grika does a respectable job filling in for Jayne Hamil as the stuffy Miss Thelma Louise Devonshire ( the sequence with Miss Devonshire getting drunk , loud and unruly in a bar is absolutely hilarious ) , and the adorable Darcy DeMoss contributes an appealing turn as nice and honest reformed criminal Samantha . Robert Hayes ' basic , no-frills cinematography is strictly okay . Both Alan DerMarderosian's bubbly , spirited score and the cool-thrashin ' theme song hit the groovy spot . As an added bonus , the delectable Toni Alessandrini struts her scorching hot stuff as a stripper while Kaitan and Parton both bare their beautifully bountiful breasts . The zippy pace , lovably wacky characters , and frothy , cheerfully inane tone all ensure that this merry romp is a complete goofy hoot from start to finish .
A delightfully dumb lowbrow horror comedy riot	Amiable horny sailors Tom Buckley ( likable Bruce Fairbairn ) and Terry Wayne ( the equally engaging Trey Wilson of " Raising Arizona " fame ) are looking for some female action while on shore leave in the Philippines . The duo run afoul of droll vampire count Richmond Reed ( the ubiquitous John Carradine hamming it up with his usual eye-rolling aplomb ) and his three gorgeous sex-starved bloodsucking nymphets Cherish ( luscious brunette Karen Stride ) , Suzy ( comely blonde Lenka Novak ) , and Marcy ( deliciously voluptuous knockout Katie Dolan ) . Veteran exploitation feature director Cirio H . Santiago and screenwriter Howard R . Cohen offer a constant barrage of amusingly dumb jokes about such topics as eating duck , transvestites , the inevitable barroom brawl , and Bloody Mary drinks ( groan ! ) . This flick reaches its gloriously ghastly peak during a marvelously protracted ten minute orgy sequence set to crudely thumping and monotonous disco music that seems to go on forever . The cast have a field day with their broad parts : Fairbairn and Wilson make for affable leads , Carradine recites poetic dialogue with infectiously hearty gusto , and legendary Filipino B-movie favorite Vic Diaz is a gas ( literally ! ) as Pavo , a bumbling idiotic servant who desperately wants to be a vampire and suffers from severe flatulence ( he even backfires in his coffin ! ) . Better still , Stride , Novak and Dolan are all smoking hot babes who aren't the least bit bashful about baring their beautiful bodies . Both the competent cinematography by Johnny Araojo and Ricardo Remias and Jamie Mendoza-Nava's generic ooga booga score are suitably cheesy . The goofy ending credits theme song is absolutely priceless . Sure , this picture is total schlock , but it's way too good-natured in its campy stupidity to either resist or dislike . A hilariously dippy hoot and a half .
A super serving of 70's drive-in schlock	A trio of sexy young stewardesses have all sorts of misadventures as they travel all over the world : klutzy eager beaver rookie Toby ( an endearingly daffy performance by busty blonde babe Pat Anderson ) romances handsome doctor David ( likable Richard Young ) while being forced to contend with her meddlesome overbearing shrew of a mother ( a hilariously histrionic Naomi Stevens ) , perky expert martial artist Andrea ( the lovely Lenore Kasdorf ) searches for her missing boyfriend , and poor Sherry ( the cute Lyllah Torena ) gets abducted by a nasty narcotics and prostitution ring run by the nefarious Donald ( a perfectly slimy Ken Metcalfe ) . Prolific Filipino exploitation feature director Cirio Santiago , working from a blithely trashy script by Miller Drake , crams the wildly colorful and eventful 71 minute running time with abundant delicious female nudity ( the first topless scenes occurs barely a minute into the movie ! ) , seedy subplots , a funky-groovin ' prog-rock score , amusingly dumb lowbrow humor , several uproariously inept chopsocky fight scenes ( the blind assassin with the cane that fires deadly poison darts is a total riot ! ) , and a rousing all-out action-loaded conclusion . Moreover , Santiago maintains a nonstop zippy pace and a light , bouncy tone from start to finish . The three female leads are all quite attractive and appealing , with Anderson the stand-out of the bunch . Popping up in nifty minor roles are Vic Diaz as crooked cop Enriquez and Dick Miller as a friendly cab driver . Of course , this flick is completely silly and ridiculous , but that's exactly why it ultimately sizes up as an absolute sleazy hoot .
A pretty creepy & effective 70's made-for-TV killer animal fright flick	This nicely creepy and enjoyable 70's made-for-TV killer animal horror item centers on a nest of lethal and poisonous ants which are unearthed by a construction crew working on a posh lakeside resort . The ants proceed to attack a few folks and trap a handful of others inside . Among those trapped in the resort are feisty elderly owner Myrna Loy , her comely daughter Lynda Day George ( who also dealt with a larger array of deadly critters in " Day of the Animals " ) , rugged construction foreman Robert Foxworth ( who later faced off with a murderous misshapen mutant bear in " Prophecy " ) , jerky sleazeball businessman Gerald Gordon and his lovely partner Suzanne Sommers of " Three's Company " sitcom fame , health inspector Steve Franken , and sexy drifter Karen Lamm . Trying to rescue the people trapped inside are construction worker Bernie Casey and fire chief Brian Dennehy . Capably directed by Robert Scheerer , with a tight script by Guerdon Trueblood ( who wrote " Tarantulas : The Deadly Cargo " the same year ) , several truly skin-crawling ant attack scenes ( the sequence where Sommers gets munched is a definite highlight , plus a little boy has a close call with the ants as well ) , a nice snappy pace , and uniformly sound acting from a fine cast , this baby makes for a most satisfying and occasionally harrowing little scarefest .
A fun little Grade B mystery potboiler	Sly , suave Oriental sleuth James Lee Wong ( the always excellent Boris Karloff ) investigates the murder of fierce shipping tycoon Cyrus P . Wenthworth ( a brief , but memorable turn by Melvin Lang ) and uncovers a plot to smuggle contraband bonds into the country . He's assisted by gruff , hard-nosed cop captain William " Bill " Street ( a perfectly huffy portrayal by Grant Withers ) and perky reporter Roberta " Bobbie " Logan ( the delightfully spunky Marjorie Reynolds ) . Competently directed by William Nigh , with a tight , clever script by Michael Jacoby , a flavorsome score , acceptable cinematography by Harry Neumann , a constant snappy pace , plenty of sharp , witty dialogue ( the sarcastic rat-a-tat banter between Street and Logan is often quite funny ) , a couple of rousing well-staged action scenes , and a pleasingly trim 67 minute running time , this film makes for a hugely enjoyable diversion . The sound acting by the supporting cast helps a lot : Gary Usher as Wentworth's laid-back rival Paul Flemming , William Stelling as Fleming's affable son Dick , Catherine Craig as Wentworth's sweet daughter Cynthia , Wilbur Mack as sleazy blackmailer Matthews , and Kenneth Harlan as shady chauffeur Ludlow . Moreover , it's a real treat to see Karloff in a juicy change-of-pace non-horror lead role . An entertaining romp .
An offbeat , original and underrated 70's drive-in gem	Naive young lady Christine Delaplane ( a solid and sympathetic performance by the luscious Alisha Fontaine ) goes to New Orleans to find her future and winds up getting a job as a stripper at a local seedy dive . So far , so familiar . But the story takes a surprising and unexpected departure into more fresh and intriguing cinematic territory after Christine has a drink with some drug in it and flashes back to the past where she was one Gertrude " Trudy " Dix , a sweet virgin who worked at a fancy bordello run by classy and kindly madam Countess Willie Piazza ( finely played by Virginia Mayo ) in the early turn-of-the-century French Quarter . Although she's set to be auctioned off to any rich pervert who pays the highest price for her , Gertrude nonetheless falls in love with nice guy pianist Kid Ross ( the always excellent Bruce Davison ) . Director / co-writer Dennis Kane and co-writer Barney Cohen concoct a dandy yarn that makes the most out of a limited budget , soaks up plenty of deliciously tangy and colorful Big Easy atmosphere , offers a fascinatingly intricate juxtaposition of the past and present ( for example , every last cast member has dual roles in the picture ) , and even provides a touching ( if occasionally too mushy ) central love story between the two engaging protagonists . Of course , we also get the usual steamy soft-core sex and tasty female nudity , with a sizzling striptease in a giant wineglass rating as a definite erotic highlight . Adding some extra spice to an already tasty celluloid gumbo is a good dash of voodoo complete with snakes , pounding primitive drums , and frenzied tribal dancers . The supporting cast comes through with a bevy of exquisitely beautiful women : Lindsay Bloom as the bawdy Big Butt Annie , Laura Mischa Owens as the frosty Ice Box Josie , Ann Michelle as kinky , disloyal junkie Coke-Eyed Laura , and Becky Allen as the fiery Bricktop . Lance LeGault positively oozes smarm as evil lecher Tom , William Simms is properly nasty as brutal bar owner Aaron Harris , and Vernel Bagneris contributes an amiable portrayal of cocky legendary jazzman Jelly Roll Morton . The handsome cinematography by Jerry Kalegeratos makes pretty frequent use of dewy soft focus . Dick Hyman's flavorful score likewise hits the swinging soulful spot . Quirky , different and ambitious , this neat little sleeper is well worth a look .
A poignant portrait of a doomed May-December romance	Shy and thoughtful 16-year-old misfit punk skateboarder Michael ( an excellent performance by Noah Taylor ) has an ill-advised stormy romantic fling with Sally ( touchingly played by Gillian Jones ) , a lonely and troubled 42-year-old woman who's a friend of his mother . Written and directed with praiseworthy frankness , insight and sensitivity by Geoffrey Wright ( who later gave us the terrific " Romper Stomper " and the equally fantastic " Metal Skin " ) , with gritty , yet polished photography by Michael Williams , a spare , rattling score by John Clifford White , superb acting from the two leads , and a heart-breaking , uncompromisingly downbeat conclusion , this stark , tight , wholly credible and absorbing little drama commendably avoids both easy sappy sentiment and lurid sensationalism while relating its moving story of a doomed May-December romance . Raw and realistic , this fine hour long feature ultimately delivers a very strong and lingering emotional gut punch .
A stunningly ghastly marvel of pure cinematic foulness	This fetid stinkbomb of a film has a notorious reputation as one of the worst movies to ever ooze its disgusting way onto celluloid . Is it really that bad ? Well , yes it is , but it's often so strange and perverse that it ultimately becomes downright mesmerizing in its unapologetic freakishness . Raquel Welch , looking absolutely gorgeous and carrying herself with admirable flair and poise , gives it all she's got as Myra Breckinridge , a ruthless , predatory and venomous femme fatale who tries to nab a sizable inheritance from blustery millionaire acting school dean Buck Loner ( an outrageously hammy John Huston ) and cheerfully destroys any hapless males and females who get in her lethal way . You see , Myra was originally the preening homosexual Myron ( a terrible and insufferably smug performance by popular movie critic Rex Reed ) prior to having a successful sex change operation ( done by none other than John Carradine ! ) . Director / co-writer Michael Sarne delivers a brutal no-holds-barred satire on Hollywood decadence , libertine permissiveness run insanely amok , and the swingin ' early 70's sexual revolution which unmercifully mocks both the stuffy old guard and hip youth culture with equal seething disdain ; this fierce in-your-face mean-spiritedness gives the picture a shocking acidic edge that certainly isn't subtle or sophisticated , but still gets the nasty job done in a hilariously vicious way all the same . The hysterically broad acting further enhances the all-out lunacy : an aged , yet spry Mae West is positively sidesplitting as blithely bawdy talent agent Leticia Van Allen ( the sequence with West heartily belting out " Hard to Handle " on stage is a total gut-busting riot ) , Calvin Lockhart camps it up to the ninth degree as fey gay Irving Arnadeus , Farrah Fawcett is a bit too convincing for comfort as giggly bimbo Mary Ann Pringle , Roger Herren likewise does dumb with unnerving conviction as macho stud Rusty Godowski ( the scene which depicts Myra joyfully sodomizing Rusty is genuinely sick and startling ) , and Tom Selleck sans trademark mustache even makes his ignominious film debut as one of Van Allen's handsome and virile boy toys . Moreover , there's also lots of clips from vintage golden oldie 30's features edited into the main narrative throughout ; this just throws the picture even more off kilter and hence adds to the bizarrely entrancing train wreck quality of the whole misguided enterprise . Now , this isn't a good film by any conventional standards , but man is this wonderfully wretched abomination a one-of-a-kind piece of remarkably vile and depraved kitsch .
An excellent and exciting road chase action thriller winner	Take-charge , take-no-crap , two-fisted father Jed Griffin ( nimbly played to gruff'n'growly perfection by the redoubtable Michael Madsen ) and his family are driving cross country in a ' 79 Couchman motor home to a Vermont ski resort . Vicious psycho scumweed band robber Rudy Wicker ( dynamically portrayed to the delectably despicable villainous hilt by Jeff Wincott ) commandeers the camper at gunpoint , shoots Jed and leaves Jed on the side of the road so he can assume his identity and subsequently elude being arrested by the authorities . Wounded , but not down for the count , Jed has to save his wife and kids before Rudy wastes them . Complicating matters further is the fact that the police , led by sensible lady officer Dana Flower ( a winningly sprightly performance by Michelle Scarebelli ) , have mistaken Jed for Rudy . Eric ( " Evilspeak " ) Weston's sinewy direction ensures that this tense , hoppin ' , mean'n'lean direct-to-video road chase action thriller barn burner snaps , crackles and pops like a wildly hyperactive bowl of Rice Crispies : the pace hurtles along at a ceaselessly rapid-fire tempo , the compact script serves as an exemplary model of straightahead - with - no - needless - fancy - trimmings narrative concision and momentum , the plentiful shoot-outs and car chases are the real four-star full-throttle four-sheets-to-the-wind stirring goods , the acting is uniformly stellar , the characters are unusually well-developed , and , the single most pertinent virtue on my list of well-regarded celluloid attributes , there's a refreshing paucity of that high-minded pretense nonsense which we should all know by now almost invariably gets in the way of the fun . A nifty and hugely enjoyable little blast of a B flick .
The first and best of the 70's nurse movies	Four lovely young nurses in their last year of nursing school experience all kinds of turmoil and excitement in their lives : sweet Susan ( winsome brunette Elaine Giftos ) tries to comfort the bitter , terminally ill Greg ( a moving performance by Darrell Larson ) , eager , but neurotic Phred ( lovely blonde Karen Carlson ) romances handsome gynecologist Jim Caspar ( affable Lawrence Casey ) , free-spirited hippie Priscilla ( the stunningly gorgeous Barbara Leigh ) gets impregnated by laid-back drug dealer Les ( the solid Richard Rust ) , and compassionate Lynn ( nicely played by Brioni Farrell ) helps out angry Mexican revolutionary Victor Charlie ( the excellent Reni Santoni ) . Despite the fact that this film was made for Roger Corman's legendary exploitation outfit New World Pictures , it's anything but your standard mindless piece of leering soft-core schlock . Instead , it's a very pleasant , charming and even often thoughtful time capsule of the social and political upheavals of the groovy early 70's ( the subplot involving Lynn and the revolutionaries is especially potent and provocative ) . Special kudos are in order for director Stephanie Rothman , who brings a welcome and refreshing intelligence and sensitivity to the material . Moreover , the four attractive and appealing female leads all turn in sound and praiseworthy work . Scottie MacGregor likewise impresses as wise supervisor Ms . Boswell and ubiquitous 70's trailer voice guy Ronald Gans supplies the off-screen voice of a psychiatrist . Stevan Larner's polished cinematography , the fantastic rock soundtrack , and the flavorsome folksy'n'funky score by Clancy B . Grass III are all up to speed . A real sleeper .
Robert Altman's inspired and ingenious modern revisionist take on legendary private detective Philip Marlowe	Elliott Gould delivers a brilliantly loosey-goosey performance as a shabby , rundown , laid-back and sarcastic Philip Marlowe , who finds himself adrift and out of place in mean'n'selfish 70's Los Angeles . Marlowe investigates the apparent suicide of good buddy Terry Lennox ( well essayed by former baseball player Jim Bouton ) . During his investigation Marlowe encounters boozy , washed-up writer Roger Wade ( a beautifully touching performance by Sterling Hayden ) , Wade's alluring femme fatale wife Eileen ( a solid portrayal by the stunningly gorgeous Nina Van Pallandt ) , sinister alcohol rehab clinic head Dr . Verringer ( a splendidly slimy Henry Gibson ) , and volatile neurotic Jewish gangster Marty Augustine ( a genuinely frightening turn by director Mark Rydell ) . Director Robert Altman , working from a wonderfully acid and ironic script by Leigh Brackett , deftly creates a morally topsy-turvy world where greed , betrayal and deception take precedent over honesty , loyalty and having a code of honor . Moreover , Altman peppers the film with a lot of nice and amusing quirky touches : numerous variations of the haunting main theme occur throughout the picture ( there's even an insipid Muzak version on the PA system at an all-night supermarket ! ) , a security guard does dead-on celebrity impressions , Marlowe keeps on nonchalantly saying " That's okay with me " at regular intervals , and Augustine breaks a Coke bottle over his lovely girlfriend's face . Vilmos Vsigmond's bright , gleaming , smoothly gliding and agile cinematography gives the film an exquisitely lustrous slick look . The lush , jazzy orchestral score by John Williams likewise totally hits the spot . Popping up in nifty bit parts are David Carradine as a spacey philosophical flake in a jail cell and Arnold Schwarzenegger as one of Augustine's goons . A real treat .
An excellent & absorbing Woody Guthrie bio film with a top-rate David Carradine performance	David Carradine , looking suitably gaunt , tattered and worn-out ( and doing his own astonishingly tuneful , subdued , rawboned singing with a hoarse , but sturdy baritone , plus playing a pretty mean acoustic guitar ) , gives a terrifically tenacious , touching and totally believable performance as legendary folk singer / songwriter Woody Guthrie in this excellent , engrossing , ruggedly authentic biopic about Guthrie's tough , but eventful formative years during the Great Depression . The late , great Hal Ashby does a sterling job directing this lengthy ( it's two and a half hours long ) , ambitious , prodigiously expansive , but never dull or meandering film : the meticulously telling recreation of the downcast , financially and emotionally troubled , spirit-wrenching Dust Bowl era never strikes a single false note , there are many acutely observed , often wryly humorous vignettes ( Guthrie's encounter with a likable , allegedly " insane " overweight man is a small gem ) , the pacing slogs along at an ingratiatingly insouciant , leisurely clip that's completely in sync with that decade's intrinsic dreariness , the hard times of the 30's are neither cloyingly sentimentalized nor grossly simplified , and the movie overall successfully creates and maintains a delicate , heart-melting poignancy that's made all the more affecting because it stems naturally from the characters and the grueling ordeals they courageously face throughout the film . Although Carradine's exemplary portrayal - - simple , sincere and sweetly moving while effortlessly radiating a durable , dignified inner strength that's quietly overwhelming in its very humility - - is the main thespian showpiece featured herein all the other actors in parts major and minor alike are equally outstanding : Melinda Dillon as Guthrie's loyal , pushy , long-suffering wife , Ronny Cox as a kindly , willful itinerant minstrel , Randy Quaid as an earnest union organizer , Gail Strickland as a thoughtful , caring soup kitchen proprietor , Ji-Tu Cumbaka as an amiable train-jumping hobo , M . Emmet Walsh as a gabby motorist who ejects Guthrie from his car after he says " st " in front of his wife , Brion James as the needy father of several hungry kids , John Lehne as a strict , repressive radio station owner , James Hong as the peppery , peevish chili cook at a roadside diner , and Robert Ginty as an impassive fruit picker . Robert Getchell wrote the fine , colorful script . Both Haskell Wexler's beautifully evocative , golden-hued cinematography and Leonard Rosenman's flavorsome , understated country and western score deservedly won Oscars . A lovely , touching and quite wonderful film .
A very charming and delightful show	Horton the Elephant ( amiably voiced by Hans Conried ) discovers a microscopic community called Whoville living in a speck of dust . Alas , Horton can't convince the other skeptical animals in the jungle that Whoville really exists . The second TV special team-up by master animator Chuck Jones and renowned children's book author Dr . Seuss ( the first was the terrific yuletide classic " How the Grinch Stole Christmas " ) , this program offers a great deal of infectiously offbeat and imaginative fun for the whole family . The catchy rhymes , the bright , colorful animation , Eugene Poddany's jaunty , merry score , the charming songs , the engagingly quirky characters , the constant zippy pace , the warm , upbeat tone , the heartening conclusion , a strong moral about the power of free speech and democracy , and the nice central message about how there's much more to life than just the obvious and what you already know all make this tale an absolute joy to watch . Moreover , Conried makes for a pleasingly folksy narrator , June Foray does double duty as the haughty Jane Kangaroo and the adorable Cindy Lou Who , and Thurl Ravenscroft lends his great rumbling deep voice as one of the evil singing gorilla Wickersham Brothers . A real treat .
A total vintage 70's blaxploitation treat	Cleopatra Jones ( the stunningly classy and statuesque Tamara Dobson ) , a no-nonsense government agent , ace martial artist and funky fashion plate , is determined to rid the inner city streets of heroin . Cleopatra's crusade against smack incurs the venomous wrath of ruthless lesbian drug kingpin Mommy ( a positively volcanic portrayal by the redoubtable Shelley Winters ) . Director Jack Starrett tackles the wacky plot with his trademark go-for-it panache : he keeps the pace snappy throughout and stages the plentiful action with considerable rip-snorting vigor ( a lengthy car chase qualifies as the definite stirring highlight ) . David Walsh's polished cinematography and J . J . Johnson's awesomely funky score ( the soulful theme song seriously smokes ) are both the authentic gnarly article . The terrific cast have a field day with their colorful roles : Bernie Casey as a dedicated drug rehab center counselor , Antonio Fargas as preening , flamboyant dope pusher Doodlebug , Bill McKinney as a despicable racist corrupt cop , Stafford Morgan as an on-the-take detective , Brenda Sykes as Doodlebug's sexy singer girlfriend , and soft-core film regular John Alderman and a Brit-accented Paul Koslo as two of Mommy's flunkies . Winters in particular has a whale of a time as Mommy : she screams all her dialogue at the top of her lungs , joyfully squeezes the shapely butts of her lovely young female servants , sports a bright red Ronald McDonald fright wig , wears a tight leather outfit , brandishes a riding crop , and totally cuts loose in a rousing , no-holds-barred womano-to-womano physical confrontation with Dobson at the end of the picture . Max Julien of " The Mack " fame not only wrote the zany story , but also co-wrote the witty script . Followed by the equally enjoyable sequel " Cleopatra Jones and the Casino of Gold . " The Warner Brothers DVD offers a nice widescreen presentation of this delightfully dynamic tongue-in-cheek vintage 70's blaxploitation treat .
A great , gruesome and hugely enjoyable 80's horror anthology winner	One of the most richly cherished memories of my gloriously misspent adolescence stems from seeing this right-on horror anthology flick in some scuzzy second-rate shoebox theater with my younger brother . We both quite enjoyed watching it and today it holds a special place in my heart for the simple reason that in our current depressingly restrictive blockbusters only multiplex monopoly this modest indie fright feature would sadly never see the light of a projector ; instead it would be directly dumped straight to video and cable TV . And that's everyone's loss , man . A snoopy reporter ( an oddly restrained performance by the usually more manic Susan Tyrell ) visits the seedy podunk burg of Oldfield , Tennessee and interviews a kindly librarian ( the late , great Vincent Price , who makes the most off his small , yet pivotal role ) , who informs Tyrell about the town's sordid , depraved , blood-spattered history by relating a quartet of spooky stories . First tale , " Zombie Love Child " - Clu Gulager gives an excellent , gut-busting turn as a clumsy , cloddish , middle-aged milquetoast dweeb who kills a young woman he's been pining for from afar and makes love to her fresh corpse ( gross ! ) . A hideously misshapen , murderous mutant zombie baby is the result of this twisted tryst . Second yarn , " The Secret of the Bayou " - A two-bit crook ( well played with customary slimy aplomb by Terry Kiser ) gets mortally wounded by two hoods he doublecrossed and is brought back from the brink of death by a wise , reclusive ex-slave old black man ( a fine , mesmerizing Harry Caeser ) who has discovered the secret to immortality . Third opus , " Of Glass and Geeks " - A carnival glass eater falls for a winsome young missus and decides to bag out on the freakshow scene , thus incurring the wrath of the carnival's formidable voodoo priestess owner ( juicily hammed to villainous perfection by " The Omega Man " ' s Rosalind Cash ) . Fouth anecdote , " Wrath of the Civil War Orphans " - A ragtag group of brutish , no-count Confederate Civil War soldiers led by a sadistic captain ( the ubiquitous Cameron Mitchell in peak scurvy form ) seek refuge in a dilapidated mansion inhabited by seemingly harmless , deformed orphan kids . Very capably directed by Jeff Burr , with a pretty warped and imaginative script by C . Courtney Joyner ( who later penned the terrific haunted penitentiary pip " Prison " ) , nicely disgusting make-up f / x by Rob Burman ( said splatter includes such choice nasty stuff as splashy gunshot wounds , gory stabbings , a torso being shredded from the inside out by sharp shards of glass , and , most gruesome of all , a severely burned-up limbless body ) , a generally serious tone with appropriately perverse touches of pitch-black humor , and nifty cameos from Hammer horror scream queen Martine Beswicke as a convicted murderess who gets executed at the very start of the film , the ever-imposing Lawrence Tierney as the grim-faced warden who presides over Beswicke's execution , and Angelo Rossitto as an antsy carny midget , " The Offspring " rates highly as pleasingly ghastly and ghoulish omnibus horror fun .
A really wild & exciting Japanese giant monster creature feature delight	This wonderfully ridiculous Japanese giant monsters wreaking mucho mondo destructo havoc hoot was originally done as a sequel to " Frankenstein Conquers the World " until American distributors momkeyed around with it and omitted any connections this baby has with that previous picture . That minor issue aside , what's left is quite simply one of the wildest , most energetic and brutally violent behemoth beast bashes to ever grunt , growl and glower its way across the big screen . The titular titanic terrors represent the two radically contrasting polar opposite sides of the existential coin ; i . e . , any living , sentient animal's latent capacity for being either very good or extremely evil . A decidedly malevolent hairy , scaly , uglier-than-dirt green leviathan fights an octopus and ravages the countryside before engaging in a rousingly savage and lengthy toe-to-toe , claw-to-claw , thingo-to-thingo knock-down , drag-out climactic confrontation with its more gentle and benign brown brother . The monster fight seriously smokes something stirring : Our two beastly behemoths vigorously mix it up and lay waste to half the landscape while beating the living tar out of each other like a couple of deranged wrestlers in a totally uninhibited anything-goes cage match . An insufferably smug'n'smirky Russ Tamblyn looks and acts properly embarrassed as the absurdly earnest young scientist who created the leaping , roaring and running simian humanoid Goliaths . Musical guest star Kipp Hamilton warbles the unforgettably atrocious'n'asinine ballad " The Words Get Stuck in My Throat " while doing the twist on stage at a swanky nightclub . A great , delectably dopey humongous creature feature treat .
The best of the 80's heavy metal rock horror films	Undoubtedly the best heavy metal horror item made in the manically headbangin ' 80's , which admittedly doesn't sound like much considering how utterly abysmal many other entries in this odd little fright film sub-genre like " Hard Rock Zombies , " " Blood Tracks , " " Terror on Tour , " and the especially ungodly Jon-Mikl Thor-starring stinker " Rock'n'Roll Nightmare " tended to be . That aside , this one still deserves props for downplaying the excessive splatter and needlessly flashy special f / x razzle-dazzle in favor of focusing on adolescent high school characters who are depicted with greater acuity and plausibility than the norm for a mid-80's teen-targeted scarefest . Moreover , the film's pointed sardonic parodying of both ridiculously overblown 80's heavy metal stupidity and the nauseating self-righteousness of the uptight killjoy conservative stiffs who claimed it was the devil's music are very clever and on the money funny ( famed Greed Decade heavy metal god Ozzy Osbourne has a hilarious bit as a smarmy anti-metal TV evangelist ! ) . Marc Price ( the hopelessly dweeby Skippy on " Family Ties " ) gives a surprisingly strong and winning performance as Eddie " Ragman " Weinbauer , a geeky , socially awkward and severely persecuted heavy metal aficionado who's constantly picked on by the stuck-up jerk preppie bullies who make up the majority of the student body at Lakeridge High School ( the cruelty and mean-spiritedness of the high school kids is nailed with painfully credible accuracy ) . Eddie's life takes a turn for the worse when his rock star idol Sammi Curr ( an impressively whacked-out portrayal by Tony Fields ) perishes in a hotel fire . Hip local disc jockey Nuke ( KISS front-man Gene Simmons in a cool cameo ) hooks Eddie up with Sammi's final , unreleased album , which when played backwards resurrects Curr's malevolent spirit back from the dead . Sammi encourages Eddie to sic him on all the vile scumbags who make poor Eddie's life the proverbial living hell , only to have meek Eddie prove to be a most reluctant would-be accomplice . It's up to Eddie , assisted by token nice girl Leslie Graham ( likeably essayed by the lovely Lisa Orgolini ) , to stop Sammi before things get too out of hand . Ably directed with commendable thoughtfulness and sensitivity by character actor Charles Martin Smith ( who also briefly appears as a nerdy school teacher ) , smartly written by Michael S . Murphy , Joel Soisson , and Rhet Topham , and capably acted by a uniformly up-to-snuff cast , this surefire sleeper even comes complete with a handful of nifty " jump " moments ( an outrageous attack in the back of a car by a grotesquely lecherous long-tongued mutant thingie rates as the definite highlight ) , a rousing " Carrie " - style high school dance slaughter sequence , a neatly utilized Halloween setting , revenge being correctly shown as a truly ugly business , and a solid central message that you shouldn't make a particular over-hyped person your hero strictly because of the calculated anti-establishment posturing said fellow does to qualify for that special status .
A sly , sexy and stylish treat	Neurotic Nancy ( superbly played by Genieve Bujold ) gives advice to the lovelorn in Los Angeles over the airwaves of her popular radio program under the guise of husky-voiced talk radio host Dr . Anne Love . Nancy rents a room from sultry bar owner Eve ( a marvelous performance by Lesley Ann Warren ) , who doesn't know that Anne is Dr . Love . Both Nancy and Eve become involved with charming mysterious drifter and pathological liar Mickey ( a terrific and charismatic portrayal by Keith Carradine ) , who's a mental hospital escapee with an enigmatic past . Writer / director Alan Rudolph deftly concocts an utterly intoxicating seriocomic cinematic meditation on the constant pursuit of love , lies and deception , the complexities of human communication , and the disappointments of romantic relationships . Moreover , Rudolph does a masterful job of creating and sustaining a deliciously smoky and jazzy retro 40's film noirish romantic atmosphere that's significantly enhanced by the throbbing and sensuous bass voice of Teddy Pendergrass on the soundtrack and Jan Kiesser's beautifully glowing neon-lit cinematography . The uniformly first-rate acting from a tip-top cast constitutes as another substantial plus : Bujold , Warren , and Carradine are all wonderful in the leads , with sterling support from Rae Dawn Chong as frustrated would-be poet Pearl Antoine , Patrick Bauchau as Pearl's smooth heel husband Zack , and John Larroquette as smitten bartender Billy Ace . One of the key pleasures of this smart and sophisticated adult entertainment is the clever , crazy and surprising ways the characters ' lives continually intersect throughout the intricate and unpredictable narrative . Better still , there's a genuine freshness and spontaneity evident throughout that's a true joy to behold . Granted , the languid pacing and quirky tone take a little getting used to , but this film overall casts an extremely enchanting spell that's impossible to either dislike or resist . Highly recommended .
School's out forever in this excellent , intelligent and wickedly subversive 70's exploitation drive-in gem	School's out forever for a brutish and reprehensible gang of snobby stuck-up preppie bullies who maim rebellious iconoclastic new kid Derrel Maury ( who gives a superbly intense and subdued performance ) . Maury bumps off the vile troublemakers in assorted clever ways only to see the other previously oppressed adolescents rise up and take their place . The vicious cycle never seems to stop . Writer / director Rene Daalder offers a provocative social allegory on the failure of revolution , the abuse of power , and how violence basically begets more violence with no real end or change in sight . Furthermore , Daalder ingeniously shows how easily victims can become victimizers if given the opportunity to do so . The high school setting in this sublimely sharp , smart and subversive winner is nothing less than an insightful microcosm of society at large with its rigid caste system and power plays and exploitation of one group by another group being brutally played out by teenagers sans adult supervision ( the grown-ups are conspicuous by their glaring absence throughout most of the picture , thereby suggesting how unimportant they are to kids trying to figure out what they are going to do with the rest of their lives after high school ends ) . This downbeat and shocking 70's exploitation masterpiece further benefits from its stand-out B-movie cast : the ubiquitous Andrew Stevens , the star and producer of countless cheesy 80's and 90's direct-to-video trash features , Robert Carradine , the ever-lovely and charming angelic blonde goddess Cheryl " Rainbeaux " Smith , future daytime soap opera star Steve Bond , " Friday the 13th : The Final Chapter " heroine Kimberly Beck , and " Eight Is Enough " sitcom regular Lani O'Grady . The late 80's cult black comedy " Heathers " ripped this movie off a lot , right down to the main story and literally explosive ending . Still , the original remains untouched and unequaled to this very day . And the incredibly mawkish theme song really must be heard to be believed !
Mario Bava's marvelously rough and hard-hitting crime thriller knockout	A trio of brutal criminals - - ruthless ringleader Doctor ( superbly played by Maurice Poli ) , vicious psycho Thirty-Two ( an incredibly feral and frightening performance by Luigi Montefiori ) , and his equally nasty buddy Blade ( a memorably vile Aldo Caponi ) - - barely manage to pull off a payroll heist . With one of their number shot down by the cops and every minute of the essence , the dangerous hoodlums are forced to take three hostages : middle-aged Riccardo ( the excellent Riccardo Cuciolla ) , his sickly infant son , and lovely young lady Maria ( the fetching Lea Lander ) . They all go on the lam in Riccardo's car . Director Mario Bava , working from a tight and bleak script by Alessandro Parenzo , relates the gripping story at a relentless barnstorming pace , does a masterful job of creating a hard , gritty , no-nonsense tone , and wrings plenty of nerve-wracking suspense from the claustrophobic confines of the constantly moving automobile . Moreover , Bava's trademark black humor is notably absent here ; in its place there's a mean and unsparing nihilism that's a true savage and shocking wonder to behold . Stelvio Cipriani's thrilling , pulsating score further enhances the grungy excitement while Emilio Varriano's plain , yet polished cinematography likewise does the trick . Starting with a deliriously messy opening robbery sequence , given an extra stinging edge by several startling outbursts of raw , ugly violence , the extremely coarse dialogue , and the fierce sweltering hot summer day setting , and perfectly capped off with a great surprise bummer double twist ending , this simply stupendous crime thriller winner makes the grade with flying colors . Absolutely astounding .
George Segal and Elliott Gould are both superb in Robert Altman's engrossing portrait of two compulsive gamblers	Bored divorced sadsack Bill Denny ( splendidly played by George Segal ) and brash , free-spirited wild card Charlie Waters ( the equally outstanding Elliott Gould ) are a couple of compulsive gamblers cursed with bad luck . The two join forces to turn fortune in their favor and follow an incredible steady winning streak all the way to Reno , Nevada for a high stakes poker game with reigning champion " Amarillo Slim " Preston where they put it all on the line for the largest jackpot score of their lives . Director Robert Altman , working from a bright , vivid and episodic script by Joseph Walsh , wisely opts not to glibly explain why both Denny and Waters are addicted to gambling ; instead Altman merely observes with bracing and unblinking acuity these two guys doing what they do and allows the viewers to come up with their own explanation for what motivates these fellows to constantly risk it all and live life on the edge . All the aspects of compulsive gambling are excitingly present and accounted for : The agony and despair of losing , the stirring fly-by-the-seat of your pants sense of recklessness when you place a major bet , the nerve-wracking stress of owing people piles of money , and the fleeting , albeit electric glory of hitting it big , plus an underlying feeling of blankness and fatalism bubbling just beneath the frantic surface . Segal and Gould display a marvelously breezy'n'easy natural and unforced chemistry that's a true joy to behold . Gwen Welles and Ann Prentiss are likewise extremely charming and attractive as a pair of cheery hookers . Popping up in standout supporting roles are Edward Walsh as a bullish , hot-tempered sore loser of a poker player , Bert Remsen as a frumpy transvestite , Jeff Goldblum as Denny's nerdy boss , Jay Fletcher as a jumpy parking lot robber , and screenwriter Walsh as Denny's sleazy , vicious loan shark . Paul Lohmann's grainy , hazy , yet polished cinematography , the vibrant , profane overlapping dialogue , the authentically seedy locations ( funky poker parlors , noisy horse racetracks , raucous boxing rings , a glitzy Reno casino ) , and Phyllis Shotwell's spare , bluesy score add substantially to the fascinatingly scroungy , but lively , funny and always compelling proceedings . A real treat .
A splendidly scary & spooky 70's seasonal slasher landmark	Made a good four years prior to John Carpenter's phenomenally hair-raising terror movie watershed " Halloween , " this superbly scary and suspenseful ahead-of-its-time seasonal slasher trailblazer laid the basic groundwork for the countless similarly plotted holiday-themed horror entries which followed in its influential wake throughout the late 70's and up until the mid 80's . The then fresh and novel , now stale and generic premise centers on a frightfully maniacal cackling lunatic who escapes from an asylum and holes up in the dusty attic of a nearby college sorority house on December 24th . At first the babbling , profanity-screaming nutjob taunts the sorority girls with disturbing obscene phone calls before proceeding to pick off the hapless lasses one at a time . Eventually a token lovely coed ( sympathetically played by the astonishingly gorgeous Olivia Hussey ) has to face the murderous kook on her own ( said only lady left heroine is called in slasher movie parlance " the final girl , " which later became a huge cliché in subsequent slice'n'dice features ) . Director Benjamin " Bob " Clark , who had previously helmed the superior zombie pictures " Deathdream " and " Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things " ( Clark's latter efforts include the first two uproariously raunchy " Porky's " films and , amazingly enough , the disarmingly sweet yuletide treat " A Christmas Story " ! ) masterfully creates and sustains a genuinely eerie and nerve-jangling atmosphere while establishing such standard body count movie components as hand-held subjective camera shots of the killer on the prowl , bravura murder set pieces ( suffocation with plastic bag , impalement on hook , and , in the single most stunning kill scene , a comely honey being stabbed to death with a crystal unicorn ornament that's brilliantly inter-cut with an angelic children's choir singing " Sleep in Heavenly Peace " with positively haunting and harrowing results ) , a creepy mystery wacko whose true identity is never revealed , a few red herring secondary characters ( notably Keir Dullea as Hussey's neurotic , violently temperamental pianist boyfriend ) , a riveting last reel showdown with a brave and resourceful heroine asserting her proto-feminist strength and independence by doing in the killer all by her lonesome , and a socko surprise ending . Cleverly written by Ray Moore , the neatly twisty script further adds several riotous dollops of bawdy humor to leaven the unnerving tension and an intelligent reason why the initial murder victims aren't immediately missed ( they left early for the holidays ) . Reginald Morris ' strikingly crisp and agile cinematography vividly captures the stark bleakness of the severely cold wintry landscape , thereby greatly enhancing the overall literally and figuratively chilling mood . The cast all turn in bang-up performances : Margot Kidder vamps it up hilariously as a hysterically brash and slutty tramp , Marion Waldman likewise amuses as the outrageously vulgar den mother , John Saxon is properly stalwart in the first of many concerned police chief parts ( a role he reprised to perfection in " A Nightmare on Elm Street " ) , " The Brood " ' s Art Hindle lurks around the edges as a hunky frat boy , David Cronenberg regular Art ( " Videodrome , " " The Fly " ) Hindle pops up as a helpful cop , Doug McGrath supplies side-splitting comic relief as a geeky desk sergeant , and a pre - " SCTV " Andrea Martin is engaging as a mousy sorority sister . Smart , absorbing and above all profoundly frightening , " Black Christmas " will most assuredly give you the willies any old time of the year .
A touching and powerful indie drama gem	Shy , withdrawn , browbeaten young Chinese girl Lee ( splendidly played with sweet , delicate grace by Lianne X . Hu ) leaves her homeland and goes to L . A . ' s Chinatown so she can live with her overbearing aunt and work a nothing job at a restaurant where her employers treat her shabbily . Things perk up in her previously bleak , thankless and miserably insular life when she befriends amiable nice guy American Steve , who tries to help Lee get out of the dismal rut she currently feels hopelessly trapped in . Lee attempts to assert her independence while struggling to respect both her people and the honorable traditions they represent . Writer / director / producer Steve Dunning makes an excellent film debut with this extremely astute , poignant and thoughtful meditation on fate versus free will . The characters and their drably hermetic working class urban corner of the world ring completely true . The performances are uniformly fine and credible . The Chinatown environment is rendered in a richly exotic and atmospheric manner . The story packs more than enough pathos , passion and pure drama to make this movie touching , gripping and incisive throughout . Moreover , it's sharply photographed with a lovely , lulling , beautifully melodic score . Dunning also portrays Steve - - and does it very well . The DVD offers a nice widescreen transfer from a sound quality print and comes with a wondrous wealth of extras which include a funny , informative and entertaining commentary by Dunning , two theatrical trailers , cast auditions , behind-the-scenes footage , a still gallery , outtakes , extra deleted scenes , fight choreography footage , soundtrack samplings , and much , much more .
A poignant & powerful rock drama with a remarkable Bette Midler performance	Better Midler gives a smashing , touching , tear-the-house-down dynamic and exhilarating Oscar-nominated performance as the Rose , a fabulously wealthy and successful popular rock superstar sensation who's been burnt-out and worn down by too much long hard time on the road , too much booze and drugs ( Rose likes to swig Southern Comfort straight from the bottle while performing live on stage ) , too many cameras in her face and too much time spent recording songs in the studio at the expense of having a meaningful and fulfilling personal life , all of which leaves Rose feeling terribly lonely , unhappy and unloved . Rose wants to take a much-needed vacation , but her pushy , ruthless , overbearing greedhead manager Rudge Campbell ( flawlessly played to intensely contemptible perfection by Alan Bates ) urges her to do a special hometown concert . Rose finds temporary solace in her relationship with good-looking nice guy drifter Houston Dyer ( a characteristically top-drawer turn by the criminally undervalued Frederic Forrest , who deservedly snagged a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his superlative work here ) , but Dyer's inability to easily handle Rose's wild lifestyle of debauched excess only exacerbates the severity of Rose's depression , which goes off the deep end into total despair with tragic consequences . Loosely based on the real-life flash-in-the-pan live fast , live hard , live like today's almost over and tomorrow ain't never gonna happen and if you live like this too much you will most certainly die young sex'n'drugs'n'rock'n'roll exploits of Janis Joplin , " The Rose " poignantly exposes the horrible price of fame and fortune , showing to often devastating effect the way fame destroys one's ability to have a personal life , pushes people to a near breaking point , and grinds people down to nothing after they lose the strength needed to withstand the strain being a famous person grimly entails . Mark Rydell's perceptive direction and the trenchant script by Bill Kirby and Bo Goldman neither glorifies nor vilifies the rock'n'roll lifestyle , opting instead to merely show its potentially dangerous pratfalls with a properly glum , depressing tone and an arresting , unflinching frankness . Vilmos Zsigmund's glittering , burnished , faded cinematography gives the film an appropriately blinding brightly saturated color flashy look , shooting the lively , uninhibited concert sequences through a dense smoky haze of piercing reddish hues ( such fellow noted cameramen as Laszlo Kovacs , Owen Roizman and Haskell Wexler also lent a hand to the dazzling concert sequences ) . Toni Basil , who had a fluke top 10 hit tune with the waggish novelty song " Hey Mickey , " did the raunchy'n'raucous dance choreography . Midler belts out all her songs in a hoarse , bluesy , whiskey-ravaged alto with incredible incendiary gusto ; the highlights include the hauntingly beautiful and melancholy title ballad , a torchy , slow-burning rendition of " When a Man Loves a Woman , " and a hilariously campy shredding of Bob Seger's " Fire Down Below " done in a drag queen bar with a bunch of outrageous transvestite celebrity lady impersonators ( 70's mock disco diva Sylvestor plays the Diana Ross lookalike ) . Midler's show-dominating tour-de-force portrayal gets sterling support from an exceptional cast peppered with stand-out character actors : David Keith as a bashful soldier , Jack Starrett as a country music road manager , John Dennis Johnson as a rowdy hick jerk in a hillbilly bar , Jonathan Banks as an oily TV promoter , Don Calfa as a smarmy music biz leech , Victor Argo as a bath house locker room attendant , Will Hare as an amiable grocer , and , in a particularly chilling and startling cameo , the great Harry Dean Stanton as a cold-hearted ahole country singer / songwriter who flatly tells Rose right to her face that he thinks her singing stinks . A sad , insightful and eye-opening film , " The Rose " makes for a truly heart-breaking , but undeniably powerful portrait of an all-too-human and fragile person who gets led down the road to ruin by the very business that ironically made her .
A strange , haunting and poignant drama about the shallowness of suburbanite existence	Burt Lancaster gives a strikingly fine , vibrant and touching performance as Ned Merrill , a washed-up , delusional middle-aged former ladies ' man failure who embarks on a bizarre journey of self-discovery by swimming through his affluent Conneticut neighbors ' pools while en route back to his house . Among the folks Ned meets during his peculiar pilgrimage are Kim Hunter as the perky , flirtatious wife of an old friend , Janet Landgard as a sweet , but sexy and enticing young woman , Diana Muldaur as a cheery divorcée , Dolph Sweet as a proud , boastful home owner , Joan Rivers as a raucous drunk , and , in an especially bravura turn , Janice Rule as Ned's bitter , snappish ex-mistress . Each individual encounter offers further sad insight into Ned's lonely and dismal misspent life . Deftly directed by Frank Perry , perceptively written by Eleanor Perry ( the script is based on a John Cheever short story ) , gorgeously shot in sparkling color by David L . Quaid , elegantly scored to beautifully lulling melancholic perfection by Marvin Hamlisch , and exceptionally well-acted by a first-rate cast , this wonderfully offbeat and moody allegory about the misery , snobbery , isolation , superficiality and shallow materialism of upper-class American suburbanite existence as well as the inevitability of getting older and the subsequent loss of youth packs a remarkably potent and poignant punch .
A truly disturbing early 80's made-for-TV shocker	It's very rare that one sees a made-for-TV movie with any real edge to it , which makes this hard-hitting effort all the more startling . It's a truly shocking , upsetting and disturbing film which openly deals with an emotionally charged , morbidly compelling and undeniably unpleasant topic ( in this case pedophilia and child pornography ) in a surprisingly frank , unflinching , nonexploitative manner and hence delivers an unexpectedly sinewy punch . Richard Masur , astutely cast against type ( he often appears in countless movies as your dad's affably goofy best bear-drinking buddy ) , delivers a frightfully creepy and utterly believable performance as Howie Nichols , a seemingly nice and harmless fellow who coaches an all-girls softball team . Beneath his warm , cuddly , ostensibly placid veneer , Howie is a deeply sick and loathsome man , a smoothly ingratiating child molester who recruits vulnerable teenage boys and girls for an underground small town kiddie porn racket . Howie's latest potential conquest is confused , bitter 13-year-old Jennifer Phillips ( an achingly fragile and susceptible Dana Hill in a remarkably gutsy , on-target characterization ) , whose messed-up home life - - Jennifer's hard-working widow mother ( beautifully played by Melinda Dillon ) has acquired a new boyfriend ( the always excellent Ronny Cox ) Jennifer doesn't like - - makes her an easy target for Howie's smarmy , pseudo-sensitive and mock-understanding affection . The sordid subject matter skirts cheap , tawdry exploitation at its most base and reprehensible , but thankfully the film itself steers clear of crass titillation and remains firmly grounded in revealing , confrontational , genuinely provocative domestic drama due to Robert Lewis ' tasteful , restrained direction , Lew Hunter's thoughtful , trenchant , grimly engrossing script , and uniformly superlative acting . Masur in particular has never been better , bringing an oily , skin-crawling conviction and , most striking of all , even a fair degree of touching pathos to his fascinatingly grotesque part : Howie's the pathetic , socially maladaptive result of severe parental abuse and neglect who honestly thinks there's nothing wrong with his unsavory carnal interest in adolescents . For once television's strict censorship code against explicitness helps instead of hurts a film , saving this movie from becoming gross , unwatchable filth . Still , " Fallen Angel " is just graphic enough to make one feel uncomfortable and thus comes recommended with reservations . All in all , it's understandable that when this potently unsettling film first aired it was a huge ratings hit and subsequently won an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Special Drama : It's an extremely powerful and gut-wrenching examination of the warped psyche and unbalanced sexuality of a predatory , unrepentant pedophile .
A wonderfully gross and graphic early 80's exploitation sci-fi / horror hoot	Yes , it's the gloriously gross'n'graphic Roger Corman-produced early 80's low-budget sci-fi / horror schlock exploitation classic with THAT scene . You know the one I'm talking about : beauteous buxom blonde babe Taaffe O'Connell gets brutally attacked , raped and killed by a hideous and slimy gigantic libidinous maggot . This terrifically tasteless and unforgettable moment rates highly as the jaw-dropping splatter highlight of the entire picture and has rightfully earned this honey a substantial cult following which it enjoys to this very day . The incredible oddball cast counts as another source of tremendous enjoyment : everyone's favorite Martian Ray Walston , a pre-Freddy Krueger Robert Englund , 90's direct-to-video erotic thriller perennial Edward Albert , the ever-intense and flaky Zalman King ( Zippie the Abbie Hoffmanesque hippie hero of " Blue Sunshine " ) , bald , hulking trash feature icon Sid Haig ( who meets a memorably grisly fate here ) , Gus Van Sant film regular Grace ( " Drugstore Cowboy , " " My Own Private Idaho " ) Zabriskie , and , best of all , even Erin Moran ( Joanie on " Happy Days " ! ) , whose repellently nasty death - - she gets disemboweled and explodes ! - - is a true treat to behold . Moreover , the special effects are surprisingly good considering the low budget , the atmosphere is potently intense and creepy , the pace hurtles along at a snappy clip , and the blood , gore and gunk is generously poured on by the nauseating bucket . Oh yeah - - and we also got a provocative subtext here about you must confront your deepest , darkest fears head-on in order to overcome them and acquire real power in life for all you devout seekers of profoundly meaningful themes in low-grade sleazy movies . Tasty trivia tidbit : future heavy duty Hollywood mainstream film director James Cameron worked on the production design and handled second unit director chores , plus a then unknown and struggling pre-stardom Bill Paxton was one of the set decorators ( I especially loved the spaceship walls which are obviously McDonald's take-out plates turned inside out and spray-painted some funky gold color ! ) . A simply stupendous piece of totally gnarly cinematic junk .
A splendidly singular & often stimulating sci-fi end-of-the-world sleeper	Fiercely self-reliant ordinary chap scientist Zac Hobson ( a marvelously vivid and vibrant performance by Bruno Lawrence ) wakes one one fateful morning to discover that a top secret experiment he's been working on called Operation Flashlight has created a lethal tear in the universe that in turn has caused every living creature except Zac to completely disappear . The opening third of this smart , witty , wholly absorbing and wonderfully idiosyncratic science fiction end-of-the-world thriller ingeniously mines a fresh and inspired line in surprising off-center humor . At first the resourceful Zac makes the best of a bad situation by residing in a swanky palatial abode , eating exquisite expensive cuisine and joyfully pillaging an abandoned shopping mall of its choicest material products . Eventually the hopelessness of Zac's wretchedly lonely plight makes him go gloriously off the wall bonkers . Zac talks to himself while playing a solitary game of pool , resorts to wearing a woman's half-slip as his sole article of clothing , declares himself ruler of the planet , blows up a gas station , and , in the film's single most sublimely audacious scene , storms into a derelict church toting a shotgun and threatens to blast a statue of Christ to pieces unless God manifests himself in the flesh for a face-to-face confrontation ( " Come out or I'll shoot the kid ! " ) . Alas , this divinely fruitcake nuttiness dissipates when Zac discovers plucky redhead Joanne ( radiantly played by the lovely Allison Rutledge ) and intimidating mystical Maori native Abi ( the commanding Peter Smith ) . Zac and Abi engage in a predictable mano-a-mano competition to be the sole recipient of Joanne's affections and have an immediate distrust of each other due to racial differences . Fortunately , the plot gets back on suspenseful track when a second possibly more disastrous catastrophe looms on the gloomy horizon , thus forcing our beleaguered trio to take action to prevent this holocaust from wiping out the human race altogether . Geoff Murphy's bang-up direction skillfully creates a potently troubled sense of compelling mystery , places marked emphasis on the engaging characters , makes wisely judicious use of special effects , shifts the tone from playfully funny to grimly serious with remarkable adroitness , and concludes the feature with an unforgettably haunting final image . The bright , wryly preceptive script by Lawrence , Sam Pillsbury and Bill Baer thoughtfully explores man's poignant need for the company of other people in order to retain both sanity and humanity , the human race's deep-seated will to survive no matter what , and the dire consequences beget by mankind's arrogant tampering in delicate areas where he quite frankly does not belong . A splendidly singular and oftentimes stimulating sleeper .
Excellent racetrack drama with a terrific performance by Bonnie Bedelia	Bonnie Bedelia delivers a fiery , roughly textured , outstanding performance in a rare substantial lead role as Shirley " Cha-Cha " Muldowney , the gutsy , sassy ( " The only thing I do fast is drive " ) , willful , supremely determined and self-sufficient real-life pioneering feminist professional race car driver who had to overcome lots of doubt , discrimination and sexual prejudice during her arduous climb to bona fide race car champion status , winning the much-coveted NHRA Top Fuel World Championship an unprecedented three times in a row . Directed with customary acuity and facility by Jonathan Kaplan , this sterling sports biopic stands out not so much for what it does but for what it doesn't do . For starters , the film never glorifies its very appealing , but still quite human and fallible heroine , offering instead an evenly balanced , fully rounded , warts-and-all portrait of Muldowney , whose remarkable success on the racetrack is countered by her often shaky and unfulfilling personal life . Shirley's victories come at the cost of her marriage to decent , but insecure automobile mechanic Jack ( skillfully etched by Leo Rossi , who manages to create genuine sympathy for a potentially unlikeable character ) and thrust her into a tumultuous romantic relationship with arrogant , sexist , philandering rival driver Connie Kalitta ( an excellent Beau Bridges ) . Still , Ken Friedman's astute , daring and forthright script gives Shirley her just due for bravely breaking down restrictive sexual barriers , refusing to buckle under often intimidating odds , and triumphantly besting men in a largely male-dominated sport . Secondly , the film doesn't go overboard with either the racetrack action or evocation of previous decades ( Shirley began her professional drag racing career back in the mid 60's and kept on racing into the early 80's ) , rightly emphasizing a most rewarding and uplifting tale of how sheer iron will and tenacity play a huge role in how successful one is in life . While Bedelia surely dominates the film with her exceptional characterization , the rest of the cast definitely hold their own : Anthony Edwards as Shirley's proud , caring son , Hoyt Axton as Shirley's supportive country-and-western singer father , Bill McKinney as a cocky drag racing superstar , Dick Miller as an understanding family friend , Paul Bartel as a pompous French TV show chef , Michael Cavanaugh as a jerky NHRA boss , and Jonathan Haze as a smooth racetrack announcer are all uniformly fine . Tak Fujimoto's crisp , elegant , proficient cinematography and Laurence Rosenthal's jaunty score add authentic flavor to the movie's meticulous recreation of past eras and equally minutely detailed depiction of the vibrant , smoky , harshly competitive racetrack milieu . The racing scenes are vivid , thrilling and atmospheric ; the wipe-out sequences are shockingly abrupt and harrowing . However , it's the tremendous accomplishments of the extraordinary Shirley Muldowney ( she served as creative consultant on this movie ) and Bonnie Bedelia's superlative portrayal which make this film a true winner all the way .
A truly delightful and magical musical fantasy treat	This delightfully off-beat , imaginative and hugely entertaining musical fantasy adaptation of Lewis Carroll's often told classic tale displays a sense of pure joy and unbridled creativity that's both quite infectious and tremendously enjoyable in comparable measure . First off , there are many marvelously manic moments of divinely demented and inspired off-the-wall lunacy . The sequence with Robert Helpmann as the hysterically bonkers Mad Hatter , a perfectly cast Peter Sellers as the equally insane March Hare and Dudley Moore as the sleepy Doormouse in particular hits a note of total comic pandemonium that's a riot to watch . The sequence with Spike Milligan as the Gryphon and Michael Hordern as the marvelously melancholy Mock Turtle likewise takes off with a wacky vigor that's just a hoot to see . And the deliciously delirious courtroom climax builds to a sidesplitting crescendo of beautifully bent , batty and berserk bedlam as well . The remarkable cast of first-rate British thespians couldn't be better : Fred and Frank Cox are flat-out hilarious as Tweedledum and Tweedledee , the ever droll'n'dotty Sir Ralph Richardson makes for a splendid Caterpillar , Peter Bull in drag is a fabulously grotesque Duchess , Flora Robson an extremely fearsome Queen of Hearts , Dennis Price a suitably ineffectual King of Hearts , and Michael Crawford is simply outstanding as the White Rabbit . Geoffrey Unsworth's sumptuous cinematography , shot in dewy soft focus , effectively depicts a dreamy atmosphere that's genuinely otherworldly and entrancing . John Barry's spirited score and the surrealistic sets and costumes further enhance the flaky merriment . Best of all is the extraordinary Fiona Fullerton as Alice ; she's so cute , sweet and utterly endearing , with a nice singing voice and a winningly sincere presence , plus she's an undeniably adorable and engaging brunette beauty , that she effortlessly keeps the viewer enchanted and enthralled with Alice's colorful and eventful experiences in Wonderland .
An excellent , exciting and provocative period action / adventure winner	1896 : A motley trio of whalers - - gruff , hostile , alcoholic third-mate Billy ( a wonderfully crotchety Warren Oates ) , gentle , humane cabin boy Daggett ( a lovely , moving performance by Timothy Bottoms ) , and fidgety harpooner Portagee ( the always fine Lou Gossett ) - - get stranded in the Artic after their boat crashes against some ice . The threesome are rescued by and subsequently adopted into a tribe of friendly , helpful , religious Eskimos . Everything goes well for a while . However , the whalers ' assimilation into the tribe and its customs proves to be quite rocky : they assist the Eskimos in hunting seals , sleep with numerous Eskimo women , engage in wrestling matches and knife throwing contests , are marked as bearers of bad tidings by a powerful Eskimo medicine man after a series of misfortunes befall the tribe , and make a fruitless attempt at getting back to civilization by stealing an Eskimo boat ( they also swipe some fish as well ) . Eventually the whalers ' opposing cultural backgrounds and differing ethical beliefs cause them to have a fierce , bitter dispute with the tribe , which in turn begets violent , tragic consequences for the unsuspecting trio . " The White Dawn " works superbly on two levels : 1 ) a rousing , rugged , totally plausible and absorbing braving the elements action / adventure feature which gives the viewer a tasteful , thoughtful , utterly fascinating look at a unique , intriguing culture that's for the most part grossly ignored and under-explored in cinema and 2 ) a trenchant , ultimately ironic examination of the fear , ignorance and ridiculous superstitions which are key components of racism and , more revealingly , significant reasons for why distinct cultures can and do clash . Assuredly directed with a clear , sharp eye for minute details by Phillip Kaufman , astutely written by James Houston and Tom Rickman , gorgeously photographed in stunning panoramic scope by Michael Chapman and scored with appropriate elegance and majestic orchestral sweep by Henry Mancini , this cracking good yarn sizes up as a colorful , enthralling and very provocative little knockout .
A hugely enjoyable and inventive supernatural horror comedy treat	Superslick phony baloney psychic parapsychologist Frank Bannister ( Michael J . Fox in excellent unapologetically parasitic sleazeball form ) has one hell of a novel and effective scam going on . You see , Frank's in league with a motley trio of unrestful spirits - - hot-tempered 70's funky black guy Cyrus ( a hilariously hip Chi McBride ) , sniveling bespectacled nerd Stuart ( an amusingly dweeby Jum Fyfe ) , and cranky , weary , pistol-packin ' cowboy old-timer the Judge ( a marvelously cantankerous John Astin ) - - who " haunt " various houses where rich folks reside ; Frank arrives on the case and collects himself a bountiful fee for exorcising the unruly ghosts . But lately things are beginning to go awry for Frank : the locals in the sleepy town of Fairwater are starting to catch on to Frank's crafty con , a loony FBI agent ( a fabulously frantic Jeffrey Combs ) wants to nail Frank , lethal mass murderer Johnny Bartlet ( a creepily on-target Jake Busey ) and his fragile , sheltered , possibly innocent accomplice Patricia Bradley ( beautifully played with touching vulnerability by Dee Wallace Stone ) further complicate Frank's already strife-ridden life , and , most ominous of all , a powerfully nasty and malevolent long dormant murderous supernatural entity reawakens from its lengthy slumber to start killing anew . Only Frank knows about this evil thing's actual existence , so he has to go into action to thwart it before it racks up a hefty body count . Director Peter Jackson ( who previously gave us the gleefully over-the-top splatterific treats " Bad Taste " and " Dead Alive " before tackling the " Lord of the Rings " trilogy and the " King Kong " remake ) and co-screenwriter Fran Walsh have concocted one wickedly twisted , complex and inventive fright film scenario , deftly blending pitch-black humor , starkly horrific scares , elaborate , but judiciously applied special effects , a breathlessly speedy'n'steady pace , madly careening and expansive cinematography , a typically lively , jaunty score by Danny Elfman , and an absorbingly tricky and winding surprise-laden narrative into a deliciously dark and unnerving cinematic brew . It's genuinely refreshing to see a horror feature from the mid-90's that isn't specifically targeted for a no-brainer teenage audience , that has the strength of its own grim convictions , that delivers laughs and jolts aplenty without one canceling the other out , that even doesn't punk out at the very end with some weak , pat , everything - gets - neatly - tied - up - with - a - bow wimpy conclusion . In short , this baby qualifies as a true praiseworthy rarity : a pretty recent full-blooded no-nonsense big budget major studio mainstream shockathon that's every bit as smart , spooky and unsettling as any really up to snuff horror movie ought to be .
A grim , gritty and hellishly absorbing portrait of everyday madness and despair	Dour , moody , petulant , very masculine and unsociable loner abattoir worker Marcos ( a fine , low-key , creepily nonchalant performance by Vincente Parra ) and his peevish , unhappy girlfriend ( the lovely Emma Cohen ) take a ride in a taxi one fateful night . The irritable cab driver tosses them out when they start making out in the back of his taxi . Marcos and the cabbie have an altercation which results in the cabbie being killed . Marcos ' girlfriend wants to tell the cops . Marcos , who's distrustful of authority due to his lowly working class social status , throttles his girlfriend in a fit of pique . Pretty soon Marcos becomes extremely paranoid and begins to kill every last person who suspects him of being a homicidal maniac ( Marcos even whacks his own brother with a wrench ) . Marcos strikes up an uneasy friendship with an earnest , but suspicious gay neighbor . Things get even more tense . Meanwhile , Marcos chops up the corpses residing in his spartan , squalid rathole abode and disposes of the body parts by incinerating them in the slaughterhouse furnace . A grave , gruesome , exceedingly unnerving and disconcerting depiction of how severe self-loathing and one's miserably meager station in life can feasibly drive you murderously around the bend ( Marcos registers strongly as a hauntingly sullen and scarily twisted proletarian anti-hero ) , this dark , stark , deeply disturbing and harrowingly plausible psychological horror portrait of everyday gratuitous violence , repressed sexuality ( there's an edgy air of homo-eroticism apparent in the relationship between Marcos and his meddlesome neighbor ) , and seething , volatile little guy angst makes for a very queasy and unsettling viewing experience . The late , great Eloy de la Iglesia's taut , austere , fiercely humorless and deliberate direction , ably assisted by Raul Artigot's grainy , gloriously unadorned no-frills cinematography , Fernando G . Morcillo's spare , spooky , nerve-jangling score , occasional outbursts of hideously graphic and genuinely shocking violence , gradual pacing , an unsparingly solemn tone , and properly subdued naturalistic acting from the uniformly solid cast , creates a frightfully squirmy and sweaty suffocating gloom-doom atmosphere which ultimately delivers one hell of a potent and lingering kick-you-in-the-gut wallop . Anchor Bay's typically up-to-par DVD offers a nice widescreen presentation with the trailer as the sole extra .
Very powerful	The Crowe family are shocked and unsettled when 12-year-old daughter Stephanie ( a brief , but memorable appearance by Anna Mary Wilson ) gets brutally murdered in their home late at night . The police suspect Stephanie's surly , naive 14-year-old brother Michael ( superbly played by Mark Rendall ) of the killing and pressure him into making a confession . Michael's distraught mother Cheryl ( an outstanding portrayal by Ally Sheedy ) and sympathetic father Stephen ( a fine Michael Riley ) don't believe the charges and take legal action to get Michael released from jail . Director Don McBrearty , working from a gripping and thoughtful script by Alan Hines , relates this startling true story of injustice , the untrustworthiness of the police , and how the law can work against us instead of for us with commendable skill , taste and restraint . The first-rate acting from a uniformly sterling cast rates as another significant asset : Rendall is a revelation as the scared and confused Michael , Sheedy and Riley are equally terrific as his parents , plus there are sturdy supporting performances by Hannah Lochner as Michael's sweet younger sister Shannon , John Bourgeois as the severe , intimidating Detective Claytor , and Rosemary Dunsmore as shrewd defense attorney Dorothy Sorenson . Rhett Morita's slick cinematography and the moody , mournful score by Alex Pauk and Alexina Louie are both up to par as well . An exceptionally potent and poignant picture which packs a remarkably strong and lingering emotional punch .
A truly astonishing over-the-top epic schlock masterpiece of monolithic proportions	Russ Meyer's stupendously trashy , excessive and gloriously over-the-top horror - splatter - comedy - rock'n'roll - musical - soap opera extravaganza still stands tall and proud as one of the greatest wonderfully wild and crazy satires on Hollywood decadence and debauchery to ever explode across the screen with an unbridled glee and gusto that's a true in-your-face demented joy to behold . A trio of gorgeous busty'n'lusty ladies ( endearingly played by the exquisitely bountiful beauties Cynthia Myers , Dolly Read and Marcia McBroom ) go to Los Angeles to make it in the rock business and hook up with legendary wacko big time producer " Z-Man " ( a marvelously maniacal performance by the amazing John LaZar ) . Pretty soon these heretofore sweet and innocent young women get caught up in the madly swingin ' and amoral hedonistic Hollywood scene of sex , drugs and rock'n'roll , which soon spirals out of control with severe and tragic consequences for all concerned . Meyer directs with his customary enjoyably overheated go-for-it dynamic aplomb , filling the frame with loud , blinding Day-Glow cartoonish colors , eye-filling buxom women whose generous assets burst forth from their tight , clingy apparel ( Edy Williams as a sexually voracious starlet and Erica Gavin as a nice , but predatory lesbian are especially hot and desirable ) , frenzied editing , a furious non-stop pace , broadly drawn caricatures , sumptuously stylized visuals ( the use of super-impositions is absolutely breathtaking ) , and delightfully overblown acting from a uniformly game cast ( Duncan McLeod in particular is a sleazy hoot as a no-count dirtbag lawyer ) . Better yet , the soundtrack of lowdown funky garage rock songs seriously smokes , the plentiful nudity and simulated soft-core sex is genuinely sizzling stuff , the positively insane violent conclusion really delivers the hardcore gruesome gory goods , the splendidly campy dialogue is priceless ( " This is my happening - - and it freaks me out ! " ) , and the shamelessly smutty , leave - no - cliché - unaccounted - for script by none other than Roger Ebert ( ! ) commendably forsakes taste and subtlety in favor of pure crude , raunchy and hilariously bawdy lowbrow humor . A true cult classic that's not to be missed by devout fans of delectably deviant , deranged and depraved oddball cinema .
The insanity of loneliness	" May " is the kind of film which quietly sneaks up on you , lulls you into a lazy trance and then knocks you flat on your butt when you least expect it , pulling the rug out from under you with a deceptive ease and subtlety that's a true breath-taking wonder to behold . It's the extremely sad , funny and ultimately terrifying in-depth you-are-there intimate and observant portrait of one May ( a simply spectacular performance of exceptional nuance and ability by the remarkable Angela Bettis ) , a painfully shy and awkward social misfit who works as a veterinarian's assistant at a local animal hospital and lives by herself in a tidy little apartment with only a creepy china doll that's kept locked up in a box as her sole friend . Things perk up for the heretofore miserable May when she meets and befriends Adam ( winningly played by the handsome and charming Jeremy Sisto ) , a nice young man with beautiful hands who loves horror movies . Moreover , May's hot , sensuous , predatory lesbian co-worker Polly ( perfectly essayed with deliciously sassy'n'saucy aplomb by Anna Faris ) has developed a lascivious interest in her as well . Alas , both Adam and Polly alike inevitably break May's poor little heart , thus causing May's already fragile hold on sanity to crumble altogether to the point where she goes murderously around the bend . May decides that the only way she will ever have an ideal companion is to make one out of the various body parts of people she kills . Writer / director Lucky McKee has created an astonishingly rich , complex and compelling character study of a fascinatingly messed-up oddball individual which wholly succeeds in making said person a completely tragic and pitiable , although scary and dangerous human being . May isn't some charmless one-dimensional grotesque ; she's an excruciatingly lonely , unloved and pathetic human being whose deep-seated ( and dissatisfied ) need for intimacy and basic human connection causes her to become lethally insane . By allowing a window of understanding and sympathy into May's damaged psyche we the viewer in turn are able to feel sorry for her even though her horrible actions sicken and disturb us . This is the astounding triumph of McKee's outstanding debut feature ; he's created a new anguished and tormented human monster that's the striking modern-day equivalent to such touching fright film monsters of yore as Dracula and Frankenstein's monster . Moreover , the fact that the whole story is totally credible makes it that much more horrifying and unnerving . And it's absolutely heart-wrenching as well in its stupendous poignancy , thanks to Angela Bettis ' profoundly moving and utterly convincing portrayal . A total powerhouse that's a definite four star must-see movie .
A terrific allegorical Depression-era period action yarn doozy	Nothing gets my blood a boilin ' somethin ' hot more than watching a rugged , brutal , mighty manly man adventure yarn done with plenty of grit , style , and insight . This truly terrific allegorical Depression-era period action doozy concerning the legendary , almost mythical rivalry between train-jumping hobos and the railwaymen who went out of their way to keep these lowly bums in their bottom - rung - of - the - socioeconomic - ladder - place most definitely fits that particular bill with astonishing deftness . Lee Marvin rules the day with his customary effortless virile charm and cool , dry humor as A # 1 , the greatest of all train-hopping hobos who's rightfully revered as a god by his fellow dingy derelicts . Keith Carradine likewise holds his own as Cigarette , the brash punk tyro kid who Marvin teaches the basic hobo ropes to . Ernest Borgnine delivers a fierce , growly , volcanically hostile and quite intimidating portrayal of cruel , callous , " screw with me buster and I'll wipe the floor with your face " stomp-ass villainy as the Shack , an exceptionally mean and ferocious train conductor who would just love to clean A # 1's clock but good . A # 1 vows to do the seemingly impossible by riding the Shack's train all the way to Portland and living to tell the tale . The always on-target , sorely missed Robert Aldrich directs this engrossing story with his trademark tautly wound , very blunt and forceful sinewy élan . Christopher Knopf's meaty , deep-diggin ' script offers a fascinating examination of man's desire to amount to something in life regardless of the station he holds , how status has to be earned ( here given a compelling old guard vs . the new generation spin thanks to the teacher and student relationship between Marvin and Carradine ) , the need for achievement , and the harsh victimization of the poor by the working class . Joseph Biroc's sharp cinematography gives the lush , verdant Oregon wilderness a lovely autumnal look . The fabulous supporting cast reads like a veritable who's who of 70's character actors : Charles Tyner , Matt Clark , Harry Caesar , Elisha Cook , Jr . , Simon Oakland , Vic Tayback , Sid Haig , and even Lance Henrikson in a " blink and you'll miss him " uncredited bit part as a railroad worker . Marty Robbins heartily belts out the stupendously rousing theme song . And the final literal duel of the titans fight between Marvin and Borgnine - - these two really get down and dance a bloody boogie , tearing pieces out of each other's hides with chains , hammers , their own feet and bare hands , and even an enormous ax - - rates as the authentic gnarly article . It's without a doubt the greatest two ugly actors making themselves uglier in a very ugly knock-down , drag-out savage smack-down every filmed - - and an immensely satisfying conclusion to this simply sensational movie .
A truly beautiful , touching and thoughtful piece of sophisticated cinematic art from the glorious 80's	This gloriously ghastly celluloid abomination is downright jaw-dropping in its flagrant absurdity and stupidity . For starters , Sylvestor Stallone as Lt . Marion " Cobra " Cobretti has to be one of the single most slimy and hateful would-be " heroes " to ever ooze his scummy way across the screen : With his three day stubble , tight jeans , long black overcoat , mirror shades , leather gloves and penchant for chewing on unlit matchsticks , Cobra exudes all the appeal and charisma of a damp sewer rat . He's also crass , vicious and morally reprehensible , the kind of vile he-man who strictly adheres to a crude " might makes right " mentality and uses excessive brute force as often as possible . Reni Santoni grumbles and mumbles his way into our hearts as Cobra's endearingly grubby junk food junkie partner Gonzales . Brian Thompson snarls , sneers and spits for all it's worth as the deranged head villain ( Thompson's delirious climactic speech towards the end is uproarious ; he keeps using the word " pig " until it becomes some sort of maniacal mantra ) . The cult of crazed lunatics terrorizing the city are a total campy hoot : For some inexplicable reason they engage in this bizarre ritual in which they clink axes over their heads . Some of them wear filthy t-shirts and dirty jeans ; others are dressed in suits . The cult appears to be made up of a diverse cross section of insane folks who are brought together by their mutual love for unhinged psychotic violence . In addition , they want to blithely butcher all us nice law-abiding average weaklings in order to make way for some new world order of gleefully nihilistic murderous barbarians . Ahh , ain't that sweet ? The gorgeously statuesque Brigitte Nielson at least looks properly stunning as a lovely aspiring model the wackos target for annihilation . Considering that Brigitte is six feet tall and built like a Buick , the scenes of her running away in stark fear from the nuts are absolutely gut-busting . She could have easily taken out at least a dozen of these freaks by delivering roundhouse kicks to their groins with her incredibly long legs , but I guess I'm digressing here . Val Avery as a huffy police chief , Art La Fleur as an irate captain , and especially Andrew Robinson as a sniveling by-the-book geeky wimp mostly just stand around and voice their disapproval of Cobra's wildly unorthodox methods . Director George P . Cosmatos tackles the ridiculous premise with a slick punchy'n'polished hopped-up style as if he was making high art ; there's a few alarmingly atrocious music montage sequences set to horrible head-banging hair band rock songs . Plus there's a shockingly abundant plethora of blatant product placements featured throughout . The amazing opening grocery store massacre set piece proudly has product placements for such items as Pepsi and Coors beer . The dialogue in this set piece is priceless : When a ranting fruitcake threatens to waste a few innocent people , Cobra flatly replies : " Go ahead , I don't shop here . " " Motel Hell " ' s Nina Axelrod briefly pops up as an ill-fated diner waitress and " Sledge Hammer " ' s David Rasche does a similarly fleeting turn as an equally doomed sleazeball photographer . Moreover , there's a raw , gritty , seedy edge to the scuzzy proceedings which really makes this movie that much more gross and disgusting . A terrifically tacky'n'trashy kitsch riot .
" My head's still swimming ! " A true Claudia Jennings 70's drive-in gem	With her lovely , delicately sculpted face , lustrous long red hair , sparkling blue eyes , slender , shapely figure , ceaseless vivacity , and strong , assertive , engaging personality , the late , great , much-missed former " Playboy " Playmate of the Year turned surprisingly good actress Claudia Jennings was undoubtedly the Venus of delightfully low-rent nickel'n'dime white-trash 70's grind-house grunge - - and quite possibly the Ultimate Drive-In Movie Goddess . Her untimely , unfortunate death at the tragically young age of 29 - - she was hit head-on by a truck while driving her car en route to an audition for a part in a film which might have crossed her over into the mainstream - - has left a yawning void that no other actress could even begin to fill . Luckily , Claudia left behind a most formidable legacy of top-rate Me Decade exploitation bilge , with such gloriously greasy'n'grungy goodies as " ' Gatorbait , " " Unholy Rollers , " " The Great Texas Dynamite Chase , " and this choice chunk of righteously raucous'n'raunchy sleaze-ball fun doing their part to keep Claudia's legend alive in $ . 99 cent two night rental bin eternity . Claudia's in peak spitfire , take-charge , no-bullst form here as Rose , a spoiled rotten little strumpet bch who wants to take over the highly successful restaurant cum prostitution , car-jacking and smuggling ring that's sternly run by her equally redoubtable , domineering , tough-minded mother Aunt Anna ( a rip-snorting slice of fat , juicy , lip-licking prime A-cut ham from veteran soap opera actress Lieux Dressler , who also popped up in the indispensable fright film favorites " Grave of the Vampire " and " Kingdom of the Spiders " ) . Rose hooks up with a couple of slick'n'slimy Mafia hoods in order to take over Aunt Anna's prosperous , eminently desirable and highly illegal operation , with the whole thing culminating in a bitterly ironic mother / daughter gunslinger-style showdown which actually transpires in a dusty , desolate abandoned ghost town ! Spirited , rowdy and immensely good-natured despite its scuzzy subject matter , " Truck Stop Women " makes for an insanely enjoyable affair that's loaded with all the right eager and aiming to please exploitation feature ingredients , namely ample gratuitous female nudity ( Claudia in particular looks completely stunning sans shirt ) , shoot-outs , bloody rub-outs ( watch for the scene where two dastardly fellows get trampled to death by irate cows ! ) , double and triple crosses , a suitably lowbrow sense of rollicking , trashed-out humor , a hit - you - over - the - head - with - a - frying - pan " liberated women gleefully stick it to smug sexist oppressive dudes " feminist subtext ( almost all the gals in this one use and abuse unsuspecting patsy guys for their own greedy self-serving reasons ) , deliciously ludicrous plot twists , and more gear-grinding , smoke-spewing , rubber-roasting full-throttle stomp on the gas mondo destructo truck chases than you can shake a rusty monkey wrench at . Highlights include one 18-wheeler taking the almighty plunge off a steep embankment and the corrupt , corpulent gutbucket sheriff having his beloved police car turned into an asphalt flapjack by a speeding Semi . Director / co-screenwriter Mark ( " Bobbie Jo and the Outlaw , " " Class of 1984 " ) Lester pumps the pace into hyper-kinetic overdrive and allows the infectiously enthusiastic actors to cheerfully emote their crazed heads off . Tubby sourpuss Gene Drew and scrawny goof-ball Dennis Fimple supply hilariously bumbling'n'fumbling comic relief as Aunt Anna's inept flunkies , John Martino lets the smarmy charm ooze freely as an excessively oily sludgewad mobster , familiar 70's TV movie face Paul Carr appears as a character so shady he even gets his own cheesy recurrent spaghetti Western-style twangy guitar theme , and generously over-proportioned Russ Meyer starlet Uschi Digard proudly displays her substantial wares as a perpetually topless truck stop trollop . The steady succession of blow-your-speakers-out boisterous country music from both the fantastic Rod Hart ( the theme song's a real doozy ) and the simply stupendous Big Mack and the Truckstoppers seriously smokes . All in all , what we've got here is a bona-fide four-star both thumbs way up 70's drive-in celluloid landmark of tremendous cultural importance and artistic integrity , meaning that it's flat-out mindless trash with absolutely no pretense or delusions of grandeur to speak of .
A positively gut-busting no-budget camp classic !	Widely hailed as one of the single most spectacularly shoddy pictures to ever disgrace the big screen , Coleman Francis ' notorious Grade Z cheapie clinker makes for an admittedly painful , but still oddly hypnotic and hence unforgettable viewing experience . The massive Tor Johnson of " Plan 9 from Outer Space " infamy stars as Joseph Javorsky , a noted Russian scientist who becomes a dangerous murderous mutant after being exposed to radiation . Writer / director Francis shows an appalling lack of both skill and finesse as a filmmaker : the plodding pace crawls along at an agonizingly sluggish clip , the continuity is dreadful ( the opening pre-credits sequence with some phantom psycho strangling a woman has nothing whatsoever to do with the rest of the movie ! ) , the screaming , four-sheets-to-the-wind overblown score roars away to an irritatingly incessant degree , tubby old Tor isn't remotely frightening or menacing ( plus he appears to have dried egg smeared all over his face ! ) , the infrequent action scenes are poorly staged and unexciting , the scratchy cinematography boasts plenty of clumsy pans and primitive fade-outs , and , worst of all , the ridiculously solemn stream-of-consciousness nonsensical narration by Francis himself blathers away throughout the entire flick about such unrelated foolishness as flying saucers and little kids feeding soda pop to thirsty pigs . However , the final moment between a dying Tor and a cute little bunny rabbit rates highly as a sterling example of sheer celluloid poetry at its most achingly pure and poignant . For all its undeniable crumminess , this slow and static stinker still casts a strangely mesmerizing spell on the dumbfounded viewer . Truly astounding in its jaw-dropping awfulness .
