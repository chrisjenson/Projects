Hiding Riddles in Plain Sight	THE RIDDLE was written and directed by Brendan Foley in what appears to be an attempt to pull the mysteries of the Charles Dickens ' novels into a contemporary story , but that attempt is thwarted by electing to use the two periods of time format in which the ' riddle ' is unraveled . Despite a cast of well-known actors , trying their best to pull off this direct to DVD movie , the end product is a long , tedious , amateurish mess that can only be considered as entertainment if viewers are fans of the cast as remembered from other films . Mike Sullivan ( Vinnie Jones ) is a journalist confined to reporting on dog racing events while he dreams of important reporting assignments . A series of similar murders happens to include an old friend of Mike's - Sadie ( Vera Day ) who runs a pub on the banks of the Thames , having just discovered an old valuable unpublished manuscript by Charles Dickens , and has a heart of gold , giving sandwiches away to such pathetic creatures as an old tramp beachcomber ( Derek Jacobi ) . Sadie's murder attracts Mike to the role of detective journalism and with the help of policewoman Kate ( Julie Cox ) he begins to tie the investigation to clues he finds in reading the Dickens manuscript . Disrupting the flow of this rather simplistic story is the use of flashbacks to Dickens ' time as Dickens ( again Derek Jacobi ) narrates a rather personal story of peculiar murders . The parallel between stories and the cross casting among actors may have worked in another's hands , but the finessing of this kind of venture escapes writer / director Brendan Foley . He draws his story to a close ( at long last ) with a tired Hollywoodesque ending . In addition to Jones , Jacobi , Cox , and Day , the film somehow attracted the attention of Vanessa Redgrave , Jason Flemyng , PH Moriarty and Mel Smith : their contributions are minimal but happily distracting . This is a flimsy bit of treacle leaving the viewer wondering how films of this quality ever find funding . Grady Harp
Running out of Comic Book Characters ? Try MTV Anime !	AEON FLUX is an embarrassment . With the number of gifted writers creating meaningful dramas begging for cinematic adaptation burgeoning , why Hollywood continues to make these bloated sci-fi / fantasy driven , flat stories that were only created as static eye candy games in the first place , into movies just begs an answer . But the incredible aspect of these creations is how the production companies lure some of our best talent into these messes that can't help but taint the artistic choices made by actors and agents . The story is the usual one : world killed by virus except for a single city isolated from the globe by a set of bad guys whose control must be challenged . Enter a superhuman , barely clad female teetering between abilities to do the impossible and the instinctive need to maintain ' human values ' and Voila ! you have a story . The characters are flat , as is appropriate for the original source . But the visuals are terrific ! There are some really beautiful sets of tasteful design and lighting that serve as the background for the idiotic goings on . And then there are the cast members who hopefully gained a good percentage of the money moviegoers garnered on this thing . Some of our best actors are here : Charlize Theron , Frances McDormand , Pete Postlethwaite , Sophie Okonedo , Marton Csokas , Jonny Lee Miller , as well as some fine newcomers . The special effects are good ( though nothing new ) and the requisite martial arts scenes are well choreographed . But in the end the viewer is simply left with asking Why . . . why do these things get made ? Oh yes , public demand and box office success . . . . . Hmmmmm . Grady Harp
An Amazing Mess !	Ray Bradbury , run and hide ! This tacky film version of his short story from the 1950s about time travel and the effect it might have on de-evolution is not well known from the theatrical run ( did it have one ? ) and exists now as a DVD on the shelves released during a slow week . What looks to be a fancy sci-fi thriller form the opening scenes quickly fools us as the computer generated graphics are re-run unaltered throughout a film that is supposed to be about different ' trips ' back in time where a major company sells macho guys in 2055 the chance to hunt dinosaurs by paying exorbitant fees to travel back in time to prehistoric jungles . One slip of the foot / butterfly while on one of these ventures and the course of evolution is altered with resultant time waves rolling over the planet changing everything to man-eating plants and beasties . Of course there is a pretty damsel who knows how to reverse the process and a hunky man to risk his life to act on her orders and everything is eventually OK . Yes , that is the story . . . and the most surprising fact about this poorly scripted , abysmally acted mess of a film is that it attracted some fine talent to portray the comic book flat characters . Edward Burns ( all buff and hunky ) is our hero du jour , Ben Kingsley is the requisite bad corporate guy sporting a ridiculous white wig , Catherine McCormack is the know-it-all woman creator , and Wilfried Hochholdinger as an evil one - all are superb actors and should have known better than to align with this flop . And the saddest thing is that for those who like this genre of sci-fi monster thrillers the creative department sold out with some of the corniest animation to hit the screen in a long time . A must miss . Grady Harp
Obviously there is an audience for this product . . . .	George A . Romero enters with yet another installment in his banal and grossly visual zombie flicks and hopefully this will be the last of them . Obviously there is an appreciative audience who enjoys watching partially decomposed bodies stomp around and grunt and eat body parts of the living because a lot of people write positively about this film . For this viewer the ' parody ' eludes . LAND OF THE DEAD is simply a dark , grotesque , poorly written , hastily thrown together bit of treacle to make money off the folks who like this genre . But how fine actors like Simon Baker , John Leguizamo , Dennis Hopper , Asia Argento , and Robert Joy agree to the casting agent's invitation to star in this film is a conundrum . Grady Harp
Even Diane Keaton and Paul Sorvino Can't Save this Mess !	PLAN B has the appearance of a quickly made , unedited , sloppy script for a movie with the attempt for an outing for the actors involved - an outing that should have been nixed from the start . It is just another Mafia-based ' comedy ' that has nothing new and lowers the standard for those participating . Joe Maloni ( Paul Sorvino ) is the crime boss more concerned about clothing and appearances than about his business of control . His personal assistant Mario ( Anthony DeSando ) is dumber than dirt and his ignorance is supposed to be funny . Maloni has whacked one of his debtors ( who just happens to be married to bookish Fran - Diane Keaton ) and Maloni takes Fran on as his assistant to work off her dead husband's debt by being Maloni's ' hit man ' . Fran is afraid of her own shadow and is unable to carry out Maloni's assignments , electing instead to transport her ' whackees ' to Florida to hide at her brother James ' house until she can figure out what to do next . This alternative to killing the three candidates is called Plan B , Plan A being to kill them ! The ending is wholly predictable just as is every line assigned in the script to the characters . Diane Keaton has made a lot of fine films and is one of our most talented actresses and comediennes , but here she screams and rants and twitches her way through a ridiculous part that quickly becomes annoying to watch . Paul Sorvino is , well , the Paul Sorvino type cast from other mobster films . The supporting cast is likewise allowed to play to the balcony in the broadest slapstick , pratfall fashion imaginable . What is supposed to be a comedy ends up being just silly and overdone . Director Greg Yaitanes needs to go back to TV sitcoms : had this flimsy story been compressed into a half-hour gig it might have had a chance . Grady Harp
Smart Actors , Dull Movie	SMART PEOPLE seems an inappropriate title for this film about chronic losers . Though Mark Poirier's script makes a point ( just because someone is intelligent doesn't make them ' smart ' ) , the concept quickly grows thin as the one-note song plays out without closure or redemption . It makes one wonder how a cadre of fine actors can accept roles in a film such as this . Dennis Quaid ( surprisingly looking fat and old and worn out ) is Lawrence Wetherhold , a widowed professor of literature at Carnegie Mellon , a frustrated academic writer and depressed blow hard who mistreats his students and has little control over his shaky family - SAT obsessed daughter Vanessa ( Ellen Page ) and smolderingly angry son ( Ashton Holmes ) and ' adopted brother ' , the hippie irresponsible Chuck ( Thomas Haden Church ) who mooches off Lawrence when times are down . In a silly ' accident ' Lawrence hits is head and has a traumatic seizure , the result of which removes his ability to drive a car for 6 months . His ER doctor Janet ( Sarah Jessica Parker ) happens to be one of Lawrence's former ' ignored ' students and still maintains a crush on the difficult-to-love Lawrence . When their professional relationship merges into a courtship , Janet must drive and tolerate the bore Lawrence has become . The story follows these uninteresting people through minor catharses but nothing much really happens . At the end of the film we still care very little about any of these characters , and that is despite the fine acting skills this cast brings to the project . Could have been good , but falls short from entertaining - if the viewer can tolerate the film to the end . Grady Harp
And the Glitzy Martial Arts Mimics Just Go On and On	' Tian mai chuan qi ' ( AKA ' Touch ' ) follows in the well paid path of the really gorgeous films that came out of Hong Kong and China ( Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon , etc ) but it raises the question ' Just how many of these small story visual epics are palatable in repetition ? Michelle Yeoh recognizes successful financial formulas when she sees one and is at the crux of this flimsy little caper film , cashing in on the popularity of the genre . The story is slight : a relic ( ny the monks of Dan Huang . The monks call upon a family of acrobats ( of course with a history of hundreds of years of secret training on how to accomplish this mission ) to retrieve it . Pak Yin Fay ( the very beautiful Michelle Yeoh ) and her brother Tong ( Brandon Chang ) take on the mission - with a few glitches : Pak Yin Fay's old boyfriend Erik ( Ben Chaplin ) is a ne're-do-well thief who possesses the necessary Heart medallion required to open the location of the Sharira . But wouldn't you know , there appears an unscrupulous nasty guy Karl ( Richard Roxburgh , a fine Australian actor out of Moulin Rouge , The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen , Oscar and Lucinda , etc ) who causes no end of problems at the site and initiates the reason for making this film : an extended martial arts dance on pillars above a CGI fire in the tomb - a place where nearly everyone in the cast is cremated after gallant swinging and flying ! Yet of course it all ends well with the Sharira being returned to the happy monks in Tibet . Corny , yes , but if martial arts films with lots of color and vistas of deserts and the holy city in Tibet stimulate you , then this film is worth your time . Michelle Yeoh is beautiful to watch , and both Ben Chaplin and Richard Roxburgh are fine enough actors to almost make you forget the pointless shallow lines they are force to deliver with as much comedic tone as they can milk from the script .

Pretty Banal Storyline but with some Good Moments Courtesy of the Cast	Rumor has it that this is a pretty banal movie . The rumor is true . Ted Griffin , the screenwriter from Pasadena , and a writer with some pretty fine screenplays under his belt ( Matchstick Men , Ocean's Eleven ) , somehow felt the need to cash in on the re-release of the classic film THE GRADUATE about his hometown idiosyncrasies and make a 30 years later ' sequel ' . Bad choice : the comparisons between the two films are just too far apart to endure tolerance from the audience . Rob Reiner has made some fine films in the past , but he lets this little bit of pastiche just get out of control . The few laughs that are implied come form some gritty lines from Katherine ( veteran Shirley MacLaine ) , playing the grandmother of Sarah ( Jennifer Aniston ) , who was the model for ' Mrs . Robinson ' in the book THE GRADUATE . It seems that Aniston returns for her sister Annie's ( Mena Suvari ) wedding to hunky Scott ( Steve Sandvoss from ' Latter Days ' fame ) with her affianced Jeff ( Mark Ruffalo ) only to realize that she doesn't seem to fit into Pasadena much less her family . Never close to her father ( Richard Jenkins ) she hears that her mother had a fling with one Beau ( Kevin Costner ) and that she may be the offspring of Beau and her mother . How she discovers the reality of the rumor is the point ( or lack thereof ) of the movie . With Aniston , MacLaine , Ruffalo , Costner and Jenkins in the cast the film has to have some good points - and it does . It is just that the idea for the story is too lame to digest and too poorly written to buy into , making this a film to watch only if you happen to love the cast . Grady Harp
A Lost Dog Collar : Impact and Consequences	SAVING GRACE is screenwriter Howard A . Rodman's adaptation of Natalie Robins and Steven M . L . Aronson's brutally realistic book by the same name of a famous wealthy family's downfall . Director Tom Kalin has previously proved that he can successfully mix biopic with drama ( ' Swoon ' ) , but alas in this tedious film he fails to make the audience care about any of his characters , despite the fact that he cast this strange collection of edgy types with outstanding actors . In the end , after witnessing an incestuous relationship between mother and son and a subsequent brutal murder , the only moment of tenderness is a very lost boy's need to recover the collar of his childhood dog , long dead but hardly forgotten in the murky soup that has been his life . Knowing that the story is true adds a bit of intrigue : the family of a plastics mogul is in the third generation : Brooks Baeklande ( Stephen Dillane ) wallows in his wealth without positively contributing to his family reputation ; his wife Barbara ( Julianne Moor ) , a former actress and Feline's salesgirl who marries into wealth only to become obsessed with climbing a ladder that repeatedly betrays her ' class ' ; their only son Antony ( Eddie Redmayne ) who moves from his mother's worshiped idol to his father's loathed rival at his being bisexual / gay to a series of affairs - none of which he finds satisfying or fulfilling , especially his ultimate incestuous relationship with his mother . The film runs from 1946 ( Antony's birth ) to 1972 and the tragic finale and during this time the audience is conducted through the superficial corridors of life among the wealthy and influential people of New York , Paris , London , Cadaques . Along the way we meet some interesting characters , paramours of Antony played by Elena Anaya , the gifted actors Unax Ugalde and Hugh Dancy , and a host of other bit parts who enliven the action or act as stimuli for the crumbling downfall of Barbara Baekeland . The various periods of time are well captured by cinematographer Juan Miguel Azpiroz who manages to give us the ' superficial beauty ' of these empty souls while keeping a safe distance from their degrading antics . The musical score by Fernando Velázquez is always too loud and falls between the cracks of elevator Muzak and takeoffs on Wagner's leitmotifs from ' Tristan und Isolde ' . The major problem with this film is that it is nearly impossible for us to emotionally invest in any of the characters , even as well defined as they are in the hands of such excellent actors . It is this distance that sinks the film , a ' biopic ' about rather distasteful folks that offers little insight into the positive aspects of their deranged behavior . Or perhaps that void is what Tom Kalin is striving to depict . It just misses . Grady Harp
A Huge Budget Period Piece from Canada : All Parade and No Circus	Much can usually be forgiven in period pieces that ask us to recall important historical events and spice them with enough love interest to keep the story going . BATTLE OF THE BRAVE tackles the 18th Century struggle for the control of Quebec ( an all of Canada ) between the British and the French with sidebars form the new America . It has the makings of a sweeping epic of fascination , but sadly in the hands of writer Pierre Billon ( whose script deserves a Razzie award for worst of the season ) and the scattered , unfocused , and confusing direction by Jean Beaudin this film is a dud - a two and a quarter hour tedious mess of a film . Even a cast a fine actors - pairing Noémie Godin-Vigneau as Marie-Loup Carignan with David La Haye as François le Gardeur , adding the lovely Bianca Gervais as Acoona , the venerable Gérard Depardieu as Le curé Thomas Blondeau , and the likes of Irène Jacob , Vincent Perez ( ridiculous in period wigs ) , Tim Roth as William Pitt , Colm Meaney as Benjamin Franklin , and Jason Isaacs as Général James Wolfe - doesn't help . Veteran actors such as these must have cringed at the crude lines written for their characters ! Cover the whole mess in a sappy musical score by Patrick Doyle and the result is a long film to be avoided . Sad to say such bad things about a costly project , but be warned . . . . Grady Harp
A Little Film Full of Fine Ideas , Some Under-realized	Writer / director Jorge Ameer may just be another edgy filmmaker waiting for larger budgets to set his ideas afire ( think Gus van Sant , Gregg Araki , etc ) . Reading all the comments and reactions to this film is fairly good evidence that he is a controversial filmmaker - and that will probably work in his favor . He has technical problems with his product : the dialogue , which is really fairly good when it can be heard , is drowned out by ocean waves , dogs barking , street sounds , and the worst pastiche of heart-tugging micro-excerpts from classical music ( Adagio from Mahler's 5th , Albinoni , Tchaikovsky ad infinitum ) ; he fails to adequately introduce his characters ' motivation which would further the storyline ; he opts for some pretty cheap effects borrowed from the archives of WW II . But given all that , THE SINGING FOREST has good thoughts about reincarnation , a stable cast some of whom show real promise , and an overall feeling of commitment that is so often lacking in these startup movies . Christopher Hayes ( Jon Sherrin ) is an alcoholic man in mourning for his lost wife , who decides to attend the wedding of his daughter Destiny ( Erin Leigh Price ) and upon meeting her fiancé Ben ( Craig Pinkston , eye candy in looks and with signs he just may become a good screen actor with some body language training ) . Christopher has met with a psychic Elvia ( Toni Zobel ) who has confirmed his thoughts that he is a reincarnated spirit of a lad named Jo who while protecting the Jews from the Nazis in WW II fell in love with a lad named Alexander : they both died in the war . When Christopher meets Ben he immediately knows that Ben is the reincarnation of Alexander . Destiny is a hard working girl , giving Christopher and Ben sufficient time together to talk , get loaded on drugs and alcohol , and act out on their hidden sexuality . Many confrontations occur , some including Destiny's discovery of the two men en flagrante , the psychic is re-consulted and the concept of reincarnation and the questions of reality / fantasy / fiction / illusion are addressed . The ending is a bit abrupt but the point is made . Many subplots are touched upon ( a rape scene that has more significance than we are allowed to understand , adequate exploration of the father / daughter relationship or the childhood histories of Christopher and Ben ) and it is obvious that budget restraints prevented development of points that should have been clarified . But Both Pinkston and Price prove promising talent that needs developing . Accompanying the film are several shorts that , while crude in nature , are funny and irreverent and again show some clever thoughts underdeveloped . In all , for a first film this is not a bad outing - if only there were some way to Dolby out all the background noise so we could actually hear the story Ameer is trying so hard to tell ! Grady Harp
Can this really be a Jonathan Demme film ?	RACHEL GETTING MARRIED proved to be an entry card for Anne Hathaway's Oscar nomination , and while she turns in a strong performance , there is really very little else to recommend this film so unlike the work of Jonathan Demme . Written by Jenny Lumet , the story of a dysfunctional family on the weekend of the marriage of daughter Rachel ( Rosemarie DeWitt ) being upturned by the arrival of daughter Kym ( Hathaway ) on temporary leave from a rehab center and the clashes that occur from this planned happy event being replaced by the revelation of occult demons from the past is the nearly two hour noisy ennui that forms this film . There are a few moments of interest ( Kym's AA meeting revelations , the tragedy that drove Kym's mother - adroitly played by Debra Winger - away in divorce , and the clash between Rachel and Kym ) , but the bulk of this film is noisy partying that goes on forever and adds very little to the tension that should have been the focus of the film . For this viewer the performance ( albeit brief ) by Debra Winger is the reason to sit through this otherwise pretty boring film . One would expect the presence of the fine actress Anna Deavere Smith to heighten the action , but she is given little to do except fade into the woodwork . It is an interminable wedding celebration that only at the end finds a center . Grady Harp
Nessun dorma . . . ZZZZZZZZZZZ	Jochen Hick wrote and directed this little thriller of a suspense film based on the concept that the AIDS virus was a sheep virus mutated by the government to rid the world of gays and was apparently tested on convicts in the years before the outbreak of the hideous disease . Were it not for the poignancy of the concept of the film , this would fall into the category of the many films about the ruination of the world by a rampant non-prejudicial infective organism . Stefan ( Tom Wlaschiha ) journeys from Berlin to San Francisco to investigate his father's scientific suppositions about the induced sheep virus and its effects of the convicts in whom it was infused . He meets with some disdain and resistance to a dead theory , but also encounters some folks who know of the theory and support his investigation . Simultaneously with his visit a series of serial murders takes place , each victim killed in a similar manner and each murder apparently accompanied by strains of music from Puccini's opera ' Turandot ' which just happens to be opening at the San Francisco Opera . A police investigator Louise Tolliver ( Irit Levi ) and her companion cop ( Kalene Parker ) follow the murders while Stefan makes the rounds of the sex clubs and bars in San Francisco trying to locate men who may have been guinea pigs for his father's theory . He encounters a strange lad Jeffrey ( Jim Thalman ) with whom he has a cat and mouse attraction and a prominent Doctor Burroughs ( Richard Conti ) who seems oddly involved in the cast of suspects . How this all come to an end is the play of the film , a story as much about the search for self identity between Stefan and Jeffery as it is a case for investigation of murders . While Tom Wlaschiha , Jim Thalman and Richard Conti do well with their roles ( they are the only three who have any prior acting experience in the film ! ) , the quality of the film sags considerably by the less than acceptable minimally talented Irit Levy and Kaylene Parker : when on screen the credibility of the story drops below zero . There are some small cameos by other actors that brighten the screen for the moments they inhabit , but in all the film is drowned by the incessant replay of ' Nessun dorma ' as sung by Mario del Monaco from a recording o the opera - and that seems to be the reason for making the film ! Good idea for a film and some good characterizations by the actors , but there is no resolution of the initial premise that started the whole thing . Grady Harp , February 06
Too Many Irons in the Fire	CONRAD BOYS is not a bad movie : the story though frequently used by others holds its own , the style of direction keeps the pace moving , the message of the movie is worth stating . The problem is one of a single person assuming the role of writer , director , film editor AND principal actor . Justin Lo does well in all categories except the last one . As pleasant as he is to look at his ability to create a believable character on film is seriously lacking . Charlie ( Lo ) is a 19-year old taking care of his little brother Ben ( Boo Boo Stewart ) after the sudden death of their mother . Charlie is a history buff headed for Columbia for college until his mother's death halts that direction . He becomes a recluse despite his friend Tori ( Nancy Hancock ) attempts to get him out of his café job and into a social life . But at last Charlie reluctantly attends a party and eventually encounters a very handsome , intelligent drifter Jordan ( Nick Bartzen ) who touches Charlie's buried attraction and the two become friends and more . Jordan has demons , some of which become painfully apparent form his life of crime's encounters from the past . Another stumbling block for Charlie's adjustment appears in the form of his long departed recovering alcoholic father Doug ( Barry Shay ) who has cleaned up his act and wants to be a part of Ben's and Charlie's lives . The myriad clashes to Charlie's fragile ego serve only to bring out his protective forces in caring for Ben and eventually his nascent longing for Jordan and his responsibility for Ben are settled in surprising ways . The cast Lo has selected is fine - especially the promising young Nick Bartzen and the solid Barry Shay . If only Lo had had the foresight to cast Charlie with an equally fine actor the film would have played more strongly . But as a first film by a young talent there is reason to view this venture . Justin Lo gives evidence of being a solid talent who just needs some focus .
Two Short Films on One DV	Joseph Graham both wrote and directed the first of the two short films on this DVD . He has some interesting ideas both textually and visually and manages to condense into 47 minutes a film that packs a wallop . ' VANILLA ' is anything but vanilla , if the term refers to the dichotomies between vanilla and kinky in the usual sense . A young lad Jeff ( Ryan A . Allen ) is a highschool photographer who happens upon the kneeling suicide victim body of a beefy serial killer in the Bay Area . Questioned by the police and his father , he becomes obsessed with the string of murders linked to sexual encounters with young men , and his curiosity contributes to an art project as well as his own drive to experience how the murders took place . Just how far his curiosity leads him is the fairly dramatic conclusion to this short film . The acting is pretty ' basic ' cum weak , and the acting out of the trysts is heavy , but Graham does use his story as a romance with the camera : the film is appropriately shot in both black and white and color with the uses of each more important than they first appear . ' A LITTLE COMFORT ' ( ' Just un pea de recon fort . . . ' ) is a brief 36 minute French film by director Armand Lamellose that employs better actors and better cinematography , and actually a better story . Arnaud ( Arthur Moncla ) is a young teenager coping with his attraction to the popular hunk Guillaume ( Remi Bresson ) who has a steady girlfriend . Arnaud imitates his idol trying cigarettes , alcohol and sex , finds a girlfriend but when both girls leave their beaus , Guillaume ( whose mother is dying and who has no family ) seeks refuge with Arnaud , whose mother is more than happy to have Arnaud's ' best friend ' stay with them rather than in a foster home . At last , in the comfort zone , away from the outside world , Arnaud and Guillaume bond , fall in love , and actually fit into the society that they feared would ostracize them . OR is this little tale merely the acting out of a dream for the tender little Arnaud . . . . it is up to the audience to decide . Films such as these , though each feel like works in progress , at least serve the intelligence of the film audience well . It has not been very long since such films would have never made it to the shelves of Amazon . com or the video stores . The success of ' Brokeback Mountain ' has opened a lot of windows , and for that we should be grateful . Now let's see the polished films of similar content that languish in the darker interstices . Grady Harp , May 06
' Sorrow is worn out old joys '	There is a moment in this short little independent film that crystallizes the message : the camera captures the sure but almost imperceptible progress of a slug making its way across a forest leaf with all the sounds of nature as the musical background . From all of the hype that is spread across the cover of this DVD we are to believe that this is the finest independent film of the year , ' shimmering with excellence ' . Perhaps for some it will be that . The very sparse script was written by Jonathan Raymond and Kelly Reichardt ( who also directs ) , the story being a couple of days camping trip between two old friends Mark ( Daniel London ) and Kurt ( Will Oldham ) who have become estranged by circumstances : Mark has married and is expecting his first child while Kurt remains trapped in the hippie generation , meandering through life without direction . The two leave Portland , Oregon with Mark's dog and head for the Cascades where they plan to soak in the hot springs . Kurt is the navigator , manages to get them lost , then recoups and the two spend a night of discussion by a campfire followed by a day at the hot springs : they return home to their separate lives , the ' old joy ' of their previous friendship seems to remain in the past . Most of the 76 minutes of the film is silent landscapes while the two are driving . There is very little dialog and what there is seems strained by the years that separate the once hearty friendship of the two men : it seems we are to believe that the silences and spare words have great significance , but it takes more than a little patience to paste it together into a story . A few gestures are made in an attempt to connect the two again , but they fail to ignite . The acting is monochromatic , the direction is flaccid , but the beauty of the Cascades makes up for a lot . It is a simple , short , plodding little film that may please some and may ( honestly ) bore most .
DIRTY is in every way Dirty . . . until the Zinger Ending !	DIRTY seems to be confused as to what it is . The viewer is lead to believe that the LAPD has an undercover anti-gang force made op of ex-gangbangers who know the streets and therefore know how to break the codes that allow gang crimes of drugs and violence to continue unfettered by arrests . Yes , we are all aware of the Rampart scandal that perhaps is the nidus for this story , but what DIRTY shows is a group of despicable , foul mouthed , evil , crime perpetrating opportunists who will do anything to make a hit - all ' protected ' by a police force that condones their actions . Cuba Gooding , Jr . is a fine actor whose recent roles have not allowed him to demonstrate his craft . Perhaps he wanted a role as a bad guy ( in the vein of Denzel Washington , Richard Gere et al who opt for smarmy roles to ' prove ' their acting grit ! ) , but he is artificial in this film as a man willing and waiting to do filthy deeds without conscience . He is paired with the also fine actor Clifton Collins , Jr . as the Hispanic equivalent of Gooding's Black bad cop . The story jumps all over the place with so many subplots and characters identifiable only by their total body tattoo differences and hampered by a script that depends on the F word and the N word and MF word as a means of communication . Gooding and Collins are partners and while Gooding seems to be the major offender to decency , Collins does little about it , leading us to believe he is an innocent victim to the Internal Affairs investigation that appears to be the endpoint of this drama . Just when the viewer is saturated by the dirt of this film's techniques and story , the gritty collision of loyalty and redemption enters at the very end , making reflection on the tale that has been assaulting our senses almost embarrassing for the viewer . In the police code , what is permissible , what is wrong , what is justifiable ? Fighting crime with crime doesn't seem a viable answer , but we are left asking the question ' What is ? ' A disturbing film on many levels , not the least of which is the fact that Gooding's agent needs a heads up on finding this gifted actor some worthy roles ! Grady Harp
Atom Egoyan Attempts Film Noir Genre with Mixed Results	We have come to expect from talented director Atom Egoyan films that linger in the mind , parceling out bits and pieces that continue to fit tightly together making the memory of his film linger and grow in impact . WHERE THE TRUTH LIES remains in the bits and pieces stage , even while actively watching the film , and one can only suppose that what Egoyan intended was a reconstructed parody of the 1940s / 50s film noir , works heavily laden with voluptuous femme fatales in plunging satin gowns and suave and dangerous slick-haired male tropes who just happen to be involved in a murder . Oddly the film succeeds on some levels while crashing and burning on others . Lanny ( Kevin Bacon ) and Vince ( Colin Firth ) are comedy duo who make the 1950s club circuits when they are not staging their annual polio telethon : Lanny is the love-em-and-leave-em ladies man and Vince is the somewhat uptight straight man who has a controlling nature . The two are involved peripherally with organized crime . All goes well until a nude female body is discovered in their hotel suite bathtub , both men having airtight alibis which proclaim their innocence ( though they have had a ménage a trois with the young college reporter victim the night before ) , but the duo split at that point for some dubious reason and haven't talked since . Jumping 20 years forward we meet an inexperienced reporter Karen O'Connor ( Alison Lohman ) ( who just happened to have appeared on their telethon 20 years ago as a recuperated polio victim and has been a devoted fan of the due since ) who has been paid to interview Vince about his life story on the proviso that she obtain information as to why the duo split . Through a series of silly circumstances Karen slowly gains her information and does indeed discover the true murderer and the true reason for the demise of the Lanny / Vince duo - but not without a lot of rangy , edgy sidebars that confuse the story line . Colin Firth and Kevin Bacon are both fine actors and do their best to make the most of this shaky script , but the film is so overly burdened with ' atmosphere ' , obvious story music , and erratic editing and splicing and piecing that after a while we , the audience simply want the fairly obvious ending to just rush to judgment . If this is a parody and a tongue-in-cheek farce then Egoyan hasn't mastered that genre . It would seem that once settled into the story , knowing that it is nothing deep or particularly thrilling as a crime buster , there is enough here to entertain , but it takes a bit a patience with the trappings .

A Different Kind of Story : Musings After the Fact	THE QUIET comes to the big screen then back to DVD as the product of a group of television writers Abdi Nazemian and Micah Schraft and director ( Jamie Babbit ) and the film has the feeling that it would have fared better in a made for television format . It is not a film without merit - the cast is good , the atmosphere created is well captured by good camera people , the twist in the story survives - but something is missing that keeps it flat . The Deers are a family with means whose generosity extends to taking in the victim of another family disaster : the troubles that hide in the Deer family far overpower the problems brought to the unit by the new member . Dot ( Camilla Belle of When a Stranger Calls , Chumscrubber , The Ballad of Jack and Rose ) is accepted into the Deer household when her deaf father dies in a freak accident : her mother died when Dot was seven and from that time to the present she has been newly deaf and mute . She is a loner , preferring to live in her own apparently silent world , finding solace in playing Beethoven piano works ( the actress actually plays the works ! ) . Her ' sister ' is high school cheerleader , foul mouthed , crabby Nina ( Elisha Cuthbert ) who barely tolerates Dot's new role in the house and at school . Olivia Deer ( Edi Falco , always excellent ) is an interior designer mother who buries her disappointments in pills , being emotionally unavailable most of the time . Paul Deer ( Martin Donovan ) is a successful architect whose apparent kindness masks a man who is having an incestuous relationship with his daughter Nina . Dot lets the audience know early on that she is indeed not deaf or mute but elects to maintain her silence as she overhears Nina's plan to kill her father . The manner in which these two girls eventually bond and accomplish the dastardly deed and the surprising ending of the family's dissolution make up the basis for the plot development . Taken on the basis of the story alone the film is fairly predictable , but it is after the movie is over that in retrospect we recognize how cleverly the writers and director and actors have shown us the fragility of each character : each is not black and white / good and evil but in a misty gray zone , a general statement for just about everyone who is in the cast ( Connor the walking failure boyfriend - Shawn Ashmore , Michelle the rowdy slutty girlfriend - Katy Mixon ) . And it is this tendency to encourage the audience to ponder introspection that takes it to a higher level . It is to everyone's credit that they have taken on a tale that is bravely controversial and make it work as well as it does . Grady Harp
The Hurdles Susan Sarandon Can Overcome	IRRESISTIBLE is a little film from Australia with big ideas and a clumsy script . The story itself is good with enough variation from the usual thriller scripts to make it enjoyable , but the writing borders on improvisation and doesn't provide the motivation for the development of the story to flow smoothly enough to maintain the credibility of the characters . Set in contemporary Melbourne , Australia , the story begins in media res with our heroine Sophie ( Susan Sarandon ) , a successful illustrator , wife of an equally important architect ( Sam Neill ) , and mother to two little girls , hearing noises and finding odd incidents . Recovering from the death of her beloved mother and caring for her grieving father ( Charles ' Bud ' Tingwell ) , Sophie's stress factor is further heightened by the fact that she has a block about the illustrations for a book whose deadline is nearing . Her husband is supportive and encourages her to get away from her problems by attending a party given by a new associate of his at the firm - the bright and beautiful Mara ( Emily Blunt ) - who just happens to be wearing the same new dress Sophie has purchased for the party . The two meet , dance together , drink together , but innuendos have started : party guests offer condolences for her mothers death but also suggest she join AA for her ' drinking problem ' . Sophie's mind continues to fragment as she imagines she is being stalked by Mara because of events that happen in her house , with her wardrobe , and with paranoia that her husband and Mara are having an affair . She decides to observe Mara closely , discovering facts that feed her paranoia , and is caught in Mara's house - and arrested . From there the story disintegrates into revelation of facts that border on melodrama with ill-defined motivations marring every scene . To reveal the ultimate nidus for the story's plot would rob the viewer of what little surprises there are here . Ann Turner could have used a script doctor before shooting this film , as the story is fine : it is just clumsy and not finessed . But once again Susan Sarandon proves she is such a fine actress that she can pull off even a spotty script and create a credible character . Sam Neill and Emily Blunt likewise do the best with what they are given with lines and direction . This is not a bad movie at all , just one that needed a bit of surgery before placing it on the screen , and the film is well worth watching for Sarandon fans . She still is one of our finest actresses on the screen today . Grady Harp
It all depends on your state of mind . . . " I'm Fine "	Even before hitting the screens , the PR machine was wild with rumors about re-writes , cuts , revisions , and doom so that when ELIZABETHTOWN finally entered the theaters it was a short gasp before it was gone . Didn't see it in the theaters , but watching this little film on DVD makes this viewer wonder just why the movie was so poorly received . Yes , it is lengthy ( over two hours ) for a story that is fairly slight , and yes , it is a bit self indulgent even for writer director Cameron Crowe , and it is true the script is odd and patchy and contains big dollops of mushy philosophy . But given all that , if you take your time and relax your expectations , this is a nice little film with many good things going for it . Drew ( Orlando Bloom ) is a bright and successful designer who has spent the last eight years of his life designing the Spasmodic show for a big Oregon firm led by Alec Baldwin . But the shoe is a bust , costs the company nearly a billion dollars , and costs Drew his job . Simultaneously his girlfriend dumps him and Drew finds himself on a machine design for suicide - when the phone rings and his sister informs him his father just died while he was in his hometown of Elizabethtoen , Kentucky . As the eldest Drew must go make the arrangements . Drew books a flight on an empty airline with only the stewardess as companion - the kooky but funny and very sweet Claire ( Kirsten Dunst ) who begins a long conversation about names , Drew's life , her life , etc . When Drew lands in Louisville he thinks he is saying goodbye ( " I'm good at remembering goodbye looks " ) to Claire , but in reality Claire follows Drew through his time in Elizabethtown and eventually assists him in rethinking and rediscovering the true meaning of success and happiness in a road trip that follows the funeral . The townsfolk of Elizabethtown are a warm and oddball crew who awaken in Drew an appreciation for his father , memories dormant and set aside for the sake of his own misbegotten success . The town loved his father and it is only after Drew convinces his sister ( Judy Greer ) and mother ( Susan Sarandon ) to come to Elizabethtown for the memorial service to end all memorial services that Drew can begin his own Claire-designed road trip with father's ashes that the whole story takes on some meaning . With some judicious pruning of a script constipated by verbiage or lazy phrases and with a bit of editing and fleshing out of some of the characters , this little non-pretentious story might have just become that - unpretentious . But Cameron Crowe is Cameron Crowe for all that , and accepting his style is necessary to sit back and have a nice little evening with these nice folks . Grady Harp
Mission Impossible III goes more for Noise and Effects than Cunning Intelligence	The reason for the success of MI I and MI II , for this viewer , was the sophisticated , scientific devices and plans used to manipulate evil by good . It was always a pleasure to watch the superior minds win . But somehow MI III seems far more interested in pyrotechniques and mass explosions and derring-do than for smart ideas and for that reason it seems less successful - but then that may be the result of watching it on the home television instead of the vast spaces of a theatrical screen . The story is negligibly the same as usual : impossible villain is superseded finally by Ethan Hunt . The role still fits Tom Cruise well , if a bit repetitious , but the strong point of this third installment is the supporting cast . We have the pleasure of Philip Seymour Hoffman's acting gifts as the arch villain , and the added pleasure of fine actors like Billy Crudup , Ving Rhames , Jonathan Rhys Meyers , Laurence Fishburne and the beauty of Michelle Monaghan , Keri Russell , and Maggie Q . And when they are not all covered by fire and broken glass and whirling helicopters and collapsing bridges etc they do make us notice them . Not a movie for those who prefer intelligent scripts , but for an evening's diversion it is entertaining , Grady Harp
Revisiting the 1960s : Was it really that strange ?	FACTORY GIRL is a film that divides viewers into those who love it and those who dismiss it as trivial trash . For this reviewer there are some strong points in this film about an almost indescribable time in our history that helps clarify points about Andy Warhol and his significance on the art scene . And one of those points is made more clear by the film's refusal to make Warhol the central character . This is Edie Sedgwick's story and it is told in a manner compatible with the times in which it took place . Director George Hickenlooper , using a story / screenplay by Aaron Richard Golub , Captain Mauzner and Simon Monjack , elects to tell this pseudo-biopic in the form of interviews and flashbacks , beginning with an interview of the makeup-less Edie Sedgwick ( Sienna Miller ) speaking to a reporter in a hospital , some time after her extended 15 minutes of fame . Edie was a wealthy beautiful but psychologically and physically damaged art student from am important , albeit extraordinarily dysfunctional , family an escaped to New York where she was taken in by the newly fashionable Pop artist Andy Warhol ( Guy Pearce ) and made a member of his bizarre family who lived in The Factory . Warhol made films ( probably some of the worst ever made . . . ) and promised fame to Edie . But Edie spent all her wealth on parties and drugs and broken promises of fame , fell in love with an unnamed folk singer ( Hayden Christensen - very shallowly imitating Dylan Thomas ) , and eventually fell out with the world and into the realm of drug addiction . All the while Andy Warhol remained the enigmatic weird artist whose relationship to the world was distorted at best . The films walks through some raunchy scenes , some glimpses of Warhol's infamous silkscreens of pop objects , and offers a chance for a fairly secure cast of actors to draw some of the people who lived in the factory - actors including Jack Huston , Jimmy Fallon , Shawn Hatosy , Mena Suvari - and those who were outside the ' temple ' - actors such as James Naughton , Beth Grant , Edward Hermann and Ileana Douglas as Diana Vreeland . Yes , there are holes in the script and the film feels like a bad hangover at times , but for this viewer the acting of Sienna Miller and Guy Pearce make the film worthwhile . This is not a pretty story but it is an informative one about the depravity of the 1960s and the lasting effects ( both bad and good ) on art and society . Grady Harp
A Peek Into The Mystery of the Moment of Discovery	A strange , creative little film , this . One that manages to make visual the chaos of quantum physics in the form of human permutations of the disorder and bizarre combination of marvel and fear that confront the mind upon a moment of discovery of a new fact / concept . This is a film that should be viewed by an audience prepared to engage those parts of the brain not usually readily accessible , but available cellules of new thought chambers that need and should be challenged if we are to continue to cope with a universe increasingly less understandable the more we study it . Beginning with the title , PRIMER , no insight is presented as to whether the meaning is 1 ) introductory text : a book that provides an introduction to a topic , or 2 ) as in biochemistry : genetic material - a molecular substrate such as a DNA molecule needed in the polymerization reaction that produces another molecule structurally similar to the substrate . That is the beginning hurdle . But if the viewer stumbles on the easy bumps , then the remainder of the story will be impossible . Instead it is recommended that this film be approached with a ' tabula rasa ' and simply watch as four young men bent on inventing the next big ' thing ' fall into discovery of what appears to be a device that involves time travel , both horizontal and vertical . The characters ( Shane Carruth , David Sullivan , Casey Gooden , and Anand Upadhyaya ) resemble talking heads and it is the dissolution of this quartet into a duet that supplies the human-interest aspect of this science experiment . First , discovery , then analytical permutations , and ultimately greed and the accompanying human foibles that are sparked by the new . This is very obviously a low budget work of love by writer / director / actor / cinematographer / producer / musical scorer / editor Shane Carruth ( yes , he does it all ) with all of the other tasks being accomplished by the remaining members of the cast . The idea of the film is good and the fellows pull it off well . If the dialogue becomes annoyingly verbose and abstract and covered by a rather pompous voice-over commentator , just rest assured that much of it isn't decipherable because of the quality of the sound and the fact that everyone talks simultaneously . And if at the end of the film you are left scratching your head as to what you have just seen , then try to quickly summarize quantum physics or the chaos theory or even something as simple as molecular biology ! It is not meant to be simple , it is meant to approximate the terror and joy of confrontation with the frontiers of science and examine how inventions dealing with the chaos theory are inexorably linked with human frailties . At a budget of $7 , 000 . this film relies more of personal commitment on the part of the crew than on the need to create a blockbuster movie . Exercise your mind - try it . Grady Harp
' If it is full , empty it . If it is empty , fill it ' !	So speaks Dieter Dengler when asked for comment at the end of his journey of jungle captivity in Laos . RESCUE DAWN is as much about the courage and fortitude of a captured soldier during wartime as it is about a true incident . From the inherent optimism of pilot Dieter Dengler ( played with commitment and finesse by Christian Bale ) the story transcends biopic and offers lessons for life in general ; the human spirit can be indefatigable . Writer / director Werner Herzog has expanded his 1997 documentary about Dieter Dengler and in doing so he has provided us entry into the psyches of soldiers captured by the enemy and the extraordinarily trying conditions in which they survive . The optimistic and eager Dengler is sent on a classified mission to bomb certain targets in Laos in 1965 with his fellow pilots including his best friend Spook ( Toby Huss ) . Denlger is shot down and captured , interrogated , tortured , and placed in a prison with fellow inmates Duane ( Steve Zahn in a career changing superb performance ) , Gene ( the emaciated and excellent Jeremy Davies ) , Phisit ( Abhijati ' Meuk ' Jusakul ) , and Procet ( Lek Chaiyan Chunsuttiwat ) . The living conditions are deplorable : the men are starved , chained together making even the possibility of caring for bodily functions negligible , and the moral is low . Dengler changes that using his ingenuity and immediately plans for escape . Duane aids Dengler but Gene fears the consequences of an aborted escape attempt . Yet with Dengler's expertise and cunning the escape into the jungle is planned and is essentially successful - until the other enemy ( the jungle ) reduces the forces to one . As Dengler is rescued he is left with the ghosts of his fellow inmates , a factor that will haunt him and alter his life after rescue . Christian Bale's performance is near perfect as are the performances by Zahn and Davies . The film feels too long at times but that also suggests that director Herzog wants the audience to understand the mental deterioration and stagnant time cycle that cripples prisoners of war . The atmosphere of the prison camp is presented well and if the ending of the film becomes a bit too ' Hollywood ' , after the 2 + hours of prison confinement that is somewhat of a relief . RESCUE DAWN is a powerful film with some of the best acting of the year's crop and certainly deserves the attention of a wide audience . Grady Harp
A Dimly Lit View into the Dark Life of a Dying Poet	' Un Ano sin amor ' ( A Year Without Love ) is a brave little Argentine film by young Buenos Aires director Anahi Berneri , a film that takes a different look at people with AIDS in the era of 1996 when the AIDS cocktail was just becoming a beacon of hope suggesting that afflicted people could survive . Though some may avoid the film because of content and the world of Sadomasochism it depicts , this little low budget movie has a lot to say in a very simple fashion and deserves the attention of caring viewers . Pablo Perez ( the very fine actor Juan Minujin ) is a young magazine writer / French teacher / poet living with AIDS ( he has returned form Paris where he had been living with his lover who died of AIDS ) . Pablo lives with his aunt in a poor apartment supported by his distant father , and while he knows he has a disease that dooms his future , he tries to continue his life day by day with no major plans . He attempts to have a social life by advertising on the Internet for dating , but because he includes the information in his ad that he is HIV positive , he gets negligible response . When his symptoms increase and he is burdened with a constant cough and respiratory problems he visits his doctor who recommends hospitalization . Pablo does not trust the ' new meds ' and refuses AZT etc . He walks the streets seeking anonymous encounters with men to satisfy his longing for physical connection and resorts to joining a sadomasochism group where he meets men who are willing to interact only on a physical level . In his loneliness he turns to his friend with the idea of publishing his diary about a man living with AIDS , yet when the book is published the results only serve to alienate his family further and he is left with nothing in a life of loneliness . Berneri has filmed this story in the gritty reality of the hand held camera and is unafraid to show the dark side of Buenos Aires ' underbelly of sadomasochism , yet he retains a degree of allowing us to ' get the idea ' without dwelling on any of the activities . Juan Minujin is completely believable as Pablo and the other cast members serve their roles well , allowing us to see the people rather than the behaviors . This may be a tough little film for some but for those who appreciate cinema verite it is a fine work of art . Grady Harp
A Bit of French Spirit Saves This Slight Story	Le Divin infant ( HOLY CHILD ) is a French made for television little film , written by Jean-Luc Goossens and directed by Stéphane Clavier , that is part of a series of films collectively titled ' Tales from the Orphanage ' , a series which opens the door to both the randy rowdiness of young boy orphans as well as the tender , needy emotions of children who land in collectives for one reason or the other . The constant seems to be the need for discovery of each child's roots or at least a return to the family so desperately needed for a child's maturing . In that way this series is both entertaining and touching . THE HOLY CHILD focuses on one boy Dimitri ( Adrien Aumont ) who while somewhat of a malcontent in his orphanage longs for a life outside . He sees a priest on the television Père Marc Aubrey ( Lambert Wilson ) , a priest well know in the media for his celebration of the benefits of chastity before marriage , and immediately identifies him from a saved photograph of him with his mother Martine ( Agathe Teyssier ) , now in prison . Dmitri leaves the orphanage and appears in the church where Père Marc is officiating in Mass . Dressed as an acolyte he confronts Père Marc with the fact that Dirt is his son . Père Marc is chagrined : how will this affect his public image of a bastion for chastity ? Dmitri pleads his homelessness and Père Marc takes him home where Père Marc's mother Mamitta ( Marthe Villalonga ) immediately offers her heart . Père Marc at last confesses to Dmitri that on the day before he took his vows of chastity as a priest he slept with Martine and agrees that he is indeed Dmitri's father . The two agree to keep the fact a secret , Dmitri lives with Père Marc and Mamitta and gradually the parish takes Dmitri into its fold . When Père Marc informs his bishop of his fatherhood , compounded by his rather recent indiscretion with Marie ( Diane D'Assigny ) with whom he sleeps after a confessional deal to keep Marie from spreading the truth about Père Marc , the situation comes to a climax - leave the priesthood or stay . That decision molds the ending of the film . Yes , it is a slight story , and yes , it moves in directions obvious form the start , but the cast is good and Lambert Wilson has a fine sense of comic timing that keeps the story on course . There is enough said about the current state of the Catholic Church's social and political stances to make it a palatable satire . It has its charms . Grady Harp
As Unpredictable as the Weather	Gore Verbinski ( Pirates of the Caribbean X3 , The Ring , The Mexican ) has an uncanny way of moving strange characters through bizarre plots while maintaining our interest and our empathy . THE WEATHER MAN was so poorly promoted when it hit the theaters that it seemed like it was going to be one of those asinine food throwing slapstick comedies instead of the very serious examination of contemporary life in the big cities , or even more about the struggle of a disillusioned man who cannot find a balance between business success and family / marital failure , it is . This viewer almost ignored it completely - until the DVD . David Spritz ( Nicholas Cage ) is a TV pawn the station uses as a weatherman : he is untrained as a meteorologist , skilled only be his TV persona success dependent on a created gag / tag line - the Nipper ( the peak worst day in the forecast ) . His personal life is a mess , separated from a disconsolate wife Noreen ( Hope Davis ) , distanced from his successful writer father Robert ( Michael Caine ) and on shaky territory with his two children - fat and sad Sully ( Gemmenne de la Peña ) and sweet but troubled pothead Mike ( Nicholas Hoult ) . To make life worse his TV persona follows him into the streets of blustery Chicago where his viewers either seek autographs invading his privacy or throw food at him as the progenitor of the lousy cold weather . This polarized existence is invaded by an offer to become weatherman on Bryan Gumbel's Hello America show in New York ( a career jump for which he longs for many reasons ) , serial confrontations with his father whom he emulates but always feels a failure , the finding that his father has lymphoma , the ridicule of fat Shelly at school , Mike's edgy involvement with his drug counselor Don ( Gil Bellows ) , and Noreen's new live-in Russ ( Michael Rispoli ) . How David meanders through this quagmire of dilemmas is the story and while it is not pretty , it is pungent . Cage inhabits the strange role of David finding a way to make this loser with a short temper someone about whom we care . It is a tough assignment but Cage meets it on every level . Michael Caine provides some of the more eloquent moments in the film : his words of wisdom and view of life are the only grounded elements of the story . Likewise Hope Davis is fine as are the cameo roles of the children as sensitively played by de la Peña and Hoult . The subject of the film is tough and the excessive use of potty mouth language is overbearing and at times one wishes Verbinski would have edited some of the gross food slinging scenes . But as an overall message movie there is much here to admire . It simply is not the mindless slapstick the posters and trailers would indicate . The PR folks on this one blew it . Worth your time and attention . Grady Harp
A Superb Beethoven Biography for the Laymen	There are many things to be said in favor of director Agnieszka Holland's ( ' Europa , Europa ' , ' Total Eclipse ' , ' The Secret Garden ' , ' Olivier , Olivier ' ) COPYING BEETHOVEN as written from fragments of questionable truths about the composer's final years by Stephen J . Rivele and Christopher Wilkinson : the film is gorgeous to look at for all its candlelit sepia scenes and of course a pleasure to hear as the musical score is primarily excerpts of Beethoven's music , and for the towering performance of Ed Harris as the deaf , dirty , cruel , grumpy , gross Ludwig van Beethoven . There have been sufficient biographies of the master to set the facts straight and this particular viewer has no problem at all with the tinkering of truth in creating a cinematic story that might help to explain the idiosyncrasies of the old master composers . It is a movie to enjoy : it is not a true story for all its attempts to recreate the life of the composer . In COPYING BEETHOVEN the premise is that the ' hard of hearing ' Beethoven needs a copyist to help him complete his Symphony No . 9 due to a premiere of the work in four days time . Wenzel Schlemmer ( Ralph Riach ) , Beethoven's usual copyist , is dying of cancer and arranges for the best pupil at the academy to assist Beethoven . That pupil happens to be a female , one Anna Holtz ( Diane Kruger ) , who arrives at Beethoven's filthy apartment and struggles to convince the composer that she is worthy of the task . Anna is in love with a bridge builder Martin Bauer ( Matthew Goode ) and finds herself devoting her mind and attention to Beethoven rather than to Martin . Beethoven has never married and instead is in love with his nephew Karl ( Joe Anderson ) who refuses to follow his uncle's footsteps and instead mistreats him by constantly begging / stealing money form him to pay his gambling debts . So with this cast of characters Beethoven proceeds to complete his now famous 9th Symphony with Anna's help . Beethoven is to conduct the premiere but must depend on Anna ( substituting for the errant Karl ) to sit in the orchestra and give him cues . The performance is of course greeted with rapture , but Beethoven knows his output is not finished and the remainder of the film deals with his struggle to write the Grosse Fugue for his final string quartet , a piece the public ( including Anna ) loathes but one that Beethoven recognizes as the bridge to the next advance in music writing . Reduced to self pity , Beethoven dies , but Anna is going to carry the torch for her hero . . . The problems with watching COPYING BEETHOVEN that will make those who know the facts of the composer's life stumble are many : Beethoven was completely deaf in his latter years , unable to hear his music much less conversations with people ; Beethoven did not conduct the premiere of his 9th Symphony but instead sat deafly in the orchestra not even able to hear the score at which he stared ; the gentility with which Ed Harris ' Beethoven shows is in sharp contrast to the rascally and despicable behavior of the real man . But those facts don't lend themselves to a good story for cinema and the writers and director were wise to realize this . So forgive the straying from the truth and settle back for a very entertaining if factually irresponsible ' biography ' . The musical portions of the film are so truncated that the music suffers , but that matters little to the impression Beethoven's 9th , even in soundbites , has on audiences . If for no other reason , see this film for the bravura performance by Ed Harris . Grady Harp
Turn a Blind Eye	EVIL ( Ondskan ) is a tough story from the novel by Jan Guillou that in screenwriter Hans Gunnarson's adaptation and Mikael Håfström's direction becomes an intensely interesting while terrifying film about all aspects of evil . It is intelligent , gritty , and transforming simultaneously and has become one of the more powerful coming of age films of this decade . Erik Ponti ( Andreas Wilson ) is a young high school lad , the son of a ' blind eye ' mother and a viciously abusive father , who makes his way through school by fighting . After a particularly dangerous fight Erik is expelled and in order for him to matriculate into a university he is sent to an academy where he encounters the controlling student leader Otto Silverhielm ( Gustaf Skarsgård ) who quickly informs him that the discipline of the school is left in the hands of the students : the faculty elects to overlook the shenanigans of the students in favor of teaching in a self-imposed vacuum . Erik is assigned a roommate Pierre Tanguy ( Henrik Lundström ) who is Erik's opposite : Pierre reads and studies and advocates the non-violence of Gandhi while Erik focuses on his athletic prowess in swimming and tries to submerge his pugilistic nature . But as the school year progresses Erik discovers the extreme evil of the students who govern the student body by violent skirmishes and humiliation of the undergrads . Erik becomes a school champion swimmer , a feat that only draws the envy and hate of Otto and his henchmen and ' times in the ring ' bring out Erik's fighting responses . He can take care of himself but when the violence turns toward Pierre , his only friend , he gathers the courage to confront the faculty with the student goon squad activities . Erik has broken a cardinal rule : he is attracted to Marja ( Linda Zilliacus ) , the kitchen help , resulting in Marja's losing her job AND she is pregnant with Erik's child . Erik is expelled , returns home to his supportive but copeless mother , has one final fight with his abusive father , and returns to his school to unmask the realities of student activities that shock the faculty . How this change affects Erik and those that he respects and loves brings some surprises to the ending of this film . Andreas Wilson offers a multifaceted performance that reminds this viewer of the young James Dean . He is able to make an essentially negative person into someone about whom we care very much . Likewise , Henrik Lundström molds his character with dignity , humor and honor and is the perfect foil for Wilson's transformation . The cinematography by Peter Mokrosinski and the musical score by Francis Shaw add exactly the right atmosphere for this daring little drama . Highly recommended . Grady Harp
' Challenged ' as a State of Mind and Heart	MILWAUKEE , MINNESOTA has everything you'd hope to find in an Indie film - good offbeat story , strong cast mixing established actors with new talent that brings out the best in both , a director who lets the story unfold naturally , enough messages to cast away any doubts that the world is lacking in spirit and caring , and an impressive list of contributors that demonstrates that there are many people who appreciate and love fine film . Writer Richard Murphy and Director Allan Mindel have shaped a tale about a mentally challenged young man and his inner strengths that allow him to make his mark on the world through sheer courage : they have succeeded in creating a memorable , touching , warmly human film . Albert Burroughs ( Troy Garity ) is a twenty-something sweet lad , mentally challenged but able to maintain a job as a copy clerk for old man McNally ( Bruce Dern ) while he is closely overprotected by his mother Edna ( Debra Monk ) . Troy's one pastime is ice fishing and because he is sensitive to the language of the fishes he has become the champion ice fisher of Wisconsin , earning prizes that amount to considerable savings ! Worried that the outside world ( outside of Milwaukee ! ) might be abusive to her son , Edna has prevented his entering contests in such places as neighboring Minnesota , places where Albert could truly become a star . Quite suddenly Edna is killed in by a hit and run driver and Albert is left to his own devices for survival . News of his inheritance and contest winnings seeps into the world and characters begin to appear to take advantage of ' the retard ' : the smarmy Jerry ( Randy Quaid ) tries to convince Albert he is his real father ; Tuey ( Allison Folland ) and her cancerphobic younger brother Stan ( Hank Harris ) are cheap con artists who try to steal his money ; a transvestite ( Holly Woodlawn ) and her bodyguard Gary ( Josh Brolin ) wiggle into the stew created by Tuey and Stan and further go after Albert's money ; and McNally posts his own agenda for ' care ' of Albert and his ' fortune ' . How each of these attempts to take advantage of Albert play out forms the line of the story , with an ending that finds Albert leading his life as an ice fisherman who is a champion in more ways than one . Though obviously shot on a low budget this film succeeds on the important levels of communication and goes beyond the ordinary with some stunning photography by Bernd Heinl and a wonderful musical score by Michael Convertino and Robert Muzingo . Troy Garity ( son of Jane Fonda and Tom Hayden ) holds his own in a role that could fall into parody and demonstrates that he is growing into a fine actor . And it helps to have the likes of Bruce Dern and Randy Quaid in the mix ! This is the kind of film that is refreshing to see made . Would that Hollywood would invest in stories of this caliber ! Recommended . Grady Harp
L ' Auberge Espagnole ' : The Sequel	Russian DOLLS ( ' Les Poupées russes ' ) is the full of love folllowup by Cédric Klapisch to his highly successful 2002 film ' L'Auberge Espagnole ' , the film that tossed multinational young people together in a Barcelona apartment and watched them interact and create some sense out of the havoc that was their lives . Klapisch has fine comic timing , a sense of spontaneity , and a cast lifted from his previous film - all ingredients for a fine little spin on current relationships . If the film is too much in love with itself , ( the self-indulgent multiple split screen viewing and back and forth pacing tends to be a bit cutesy ) , in the end there is so much fun and wry wisdom to spread around that many of the holes in the script can be forgiven . The story focuses on events five years after the Barcelona doings in ' L'Auberge Espagnole ' and yet as the main character Xavier Rousseau ( Romain Duris ) narrates the current tale he finds the need for flashbacks to explain current circumstances . William ( Kevin Bishop ) , the bigot from before who labeled roommate Tobias ( Barnaby Metschurat ) as a Nazi , has smoothed out a bit and in fact has found love in a Russian girl Natacha ( Evguenya Obraztsova ) , a Russian ballet dancer who lives in St . Petersburg and the current story is supposed to be about their wedding in St . Petersburg which will also be a reunion for all the roommates from Barcelona . Xavier is a writer who is forced to be a ghostwriter for celebrities who want to publish memoirs because he has difficulty writing a silly television love series and is stuck in his writing of his own novel . He cannot keep relationships ( but then very few in this group of friends can ) and he teeters between his allegiance to his ex Martine ( Audrey Tautou ) , while moving in on one of the celebrity interviewees Celia ( Lucy Gordon ) . He is warned by his lesbian roommate Isabelle ( Cécile De France ) about his wanton ways but Xavier uses Isabelle as cover for his 98-year-old grandfather ( Pierre Gérald ) , who insists he marry . Xavier toys with a beautiful black girl Kassia ( Aïssa Maïga ) and is rejected , and just about the time when Xavier feels as though he will never find the right girl ( ' You just keep opening them like Russian nested dolls hoping that the one in the center will be your choice ' ) , his script is picked up by BBC and he flies to London to work with Wendy ( Kelly Reilly - William's attractive sister , unsuccessful in finding a decent mate ) and voila ! The rest of the intrigue is best left to the viewer : it does become complicated and multilingual and hilarious . . . and touching . Weaving all the cast members form his first film into the resolution of the second film proves to have some problems in continuity , but then this is not great writing nor was it meant to be . This is French comedy in fine form and is a thoroughly entertaining film and the chance to watch some beautiful people display how crazy relationships today have become . Grady Harp
A Very Fine , Fascinating Film That Seems to be Unfinished	CONSPIRACY OF SILENCE is a moody , dark , probing inquiry into the concept of celibacy of priests in the Catholic Church in Ireland and all the way to the Vatican . The concept , story and script by Writer / Director John Deery are tight , arrow sharp in aim , but ultimately unresolved issues cloud the success of what could have been a pungent movie . Set in a seminary in Ireland for preparing young men for the priesthood , we are introduced to some warmly human characters such as Daniel McLaughlin ( Jonathan Forbes ) , a squeaky clean lad who gave up a girlfriend Sinead ( Catherine Walker ) to follow his ( and his family's ) life ambition to become a priest . Naive , warm , loving , athletic and bright , he is the seminary poster boy - until one evening after hours he innocently visits a fellow seminarian's room and is the focus of seduction by the student who kindly says ' we're all only human and have our needs ' . Daniel gently declines the advances , leaves the student's room but is observed by an old priest with demons of his own . The priest reports the incident and Daniel is abruptly thrown out of the seminary by the evil Rector Cathal ( Sean McGinley ) for being homosexual - a charge that couldn't be farther from the truth . At the same time in another part of the seminary the fine Father Sweeney dresses in all his priestly regalia and commits suicide is a gruesome way . His suicide is threatening to the staff of the seminary and a cover-up is immediately put in place . It seems Father Sweeney some four years ago had stirred controversy in the Vatican by publicly exposing his HIV status , alerting the Church and the world that HIV was rampant in the world wide Church . His partner left the priesthood , disillusioned , but following FR Sweeney to the seminary in Ireland . An earnest reporter David Foley ( Jason Barry ) begins the investigation of the suicide and in doing so finds the reason for Daniel's expulsion as well as the myriad dark secrets being covered by the Church - all to do with the concept of celibacy and the inevitable sequelae of sensual deprivation on priests . One Father Jack Dowling ( Hugh Bonneville ) supports David and Daniel and is disenchanted with the behavior of the Church against its own priests . Then , without resolving any of these fascinating strings of thought the movie ends , leaving many questions unanswered - as though there are no answers . The acting is uniformly strong ( including the likes of Brenda Fricker as Daniel's mother et al ) , for once giving a spectrum of the priesthood that is not favoring bad or good . These characters are men with convictions and none can be faulted for their stances . The setting in Ireland is magnificently captured by cinematographer Jason Lehel , and Francis Haines and Stephen W . Parsons provide a hauntingly beautiful musical score . As far as it takes us this is a fine film . Perhaps Deery is planning Part II to finish this story ! Grady Harp
Following Your Heart : Something Old and Something New	SOMETHING NEW is one of those films that many will pass by thinking it is just another Chick Flick with a twist . Well , this little movie may be a romantic comedy but it is well written ( Kriss Turner ) , well directed ( Sanaa Hamri ) , and very well acted and has some down to earth important observations about interpersonal relationships . . . and , oh yes , it deal with interracial issues , beautifully ! Kenya ( Sanaa Lathan - Best Man , Blade , The Wood , etc ) is a beautiful Type A personality , an overachiever who is up for Partner in her Accounting Firm : she has no time to search for IMB ( Important Black Man ) as her list of qualifications is far too extensive . Her fellow professional girlfriends ( Wendy Raquel Robinson , Golden Brooks and Taraji P . Henson - all superb ! ) encourage her to date to ' go with the flow ' and a fellow business associate sets her up with a blind date - the very handsome , hunky , landscape architect Brian Kelly ( Simon Baker - superb actor from Tasmania , Australia has starred in LA Confidential , Book of Love , The Ring Two , The Affair of the Necklace etc ) - and despite the fact that Kenya refuses to consider dating any man who is not black , she does accept Brian's card and in no time hires him to landscape her new home . The usual dating events occur : Simon is an educated , laid-back , tender , thoughtful , adventuresome male who happens to fall in love with the closely guarded Kenya ; when introduced at parties Simon falls victim to prejudice form black men AND form Kenya's parents ; Kenya gradually succumbs to Brian's charms and despite all misgivings they begin an affair . But peer pressures , work demands , and Kenya's self doubt jumble matters and she decides she must search for a black man . One ' just happens ' to appear as Mark ( Blair Underwood ) and for a moment Kenya believes she has found her ideal - until her heart speaks up and she for the first time is honest with her emotions and follows her true heart's desire . The apparent disparity between Kenya and Brian is handled in a sensitive and realistic way and Lathan and Baker have a sizzling screen chemistry . The supporting roles are in excellent hands : in addition to those mentioned above there are fine roles by Alfre Woodward , Earl Billings , Donald Faison , Mike Epps etc . This is a fine little film that approaches the touchy subject of black professional women who are unmarried ( ' 42 . 4 Percent ' was the working title ) and for once shows an interracial film that is more a sound love story than a sermon . It is light , airy , important , and thoroughly entertaining ! ( This coming from a viewer who doesn't particularly care for Chick Flicks . . . . ! ) . Grady Harp
A Bravura Broadbent Portrayal	The Myra Hindley / Ian Brady Moors murders of 1963 , one of the most heinous crimes in England since Jack the Ripper , has been beautifully transcribed to the screen by writer Peter Morgan and Director Tom Hooper . And though the story is basically about Longford's relationship with the incarcerated Myra Hindley , the film paints a rather complete portrait of a strange man who vacillated during his lifetime among religious beliefs and spoke out strongly for the rights of prisoners and ' unfortunates ' who fall out of line with the law all the while riling against pornography and other vices . Jim Broadbent creates a wholly credible Lord Longford in this amazing performance . Transformed physically to resemble Longford's bizarre appearance , Broadbent manages to convey the spectrum of trust , self-doubt , pity , outrage , compassion and blind religious belief in a manner few actors could match . The remainder of the cast is equally excellent : Samantha Morton finds every nook and cranny of the enigmatic murderess Myra while Andy Serkis gives a chilling depiction of Ian Brady , her accomplice who knew how to manipulate the government and people as well as the infamously wily Myra . The story is in many ways grounded by the strong forces of Lady Longford ( beautifully realized by Lindsay Duncan ) and the Lady Tree of Sarah Crowden and Harold Wilson of Robert Pugh . Hooper knows how to magnify the class differences between the gentry and the working class and his choices of locations and pacing of confrontations both in the prison and in the home and in the court are spot on . This is one of those films for television that teaches us what really fine films can still be . It is a tremendously moving piece of work and Jim Broadbent will long be remember for this classic role . Highly recommended for repeated viewing . Grady Harp
A High Tension Tale Examining the Extent of Human Violence	GREEN STREET HOOLIGANS is much easier on the psyche to watch in the home DVD version than in the theater release . It is a story so packed with violence that the underlying subplots get lost until the film is reduced to the size of a television screen . Lexi Alexander wrote ( with Dougie Brimson and Joshua Shelov ) and directed this tense story about the strange cults ( ' firms ' ) of grown men who align with the various soccer / football teams in London , accompanying the games with intense fighting in the manner of ' hooliganism ' . The story is well told by introducing a Yank into this atmosphere , allowing the viewer to see the origins and machinations of hooliganism from a fairly unbiased stance . Matt Buckner ( Elijah Wood ) has just been expelled form Harvard in his last semester , taking the blame for his coke-snorting hotshot roommate whose family is too important for such blunderings . Somewhat without direction and not having his degree in journalism completed ( Matt's father - Henry Goodman - is a high ranking international journalist whose time is spent in foreign ports since the death of Matt's mother ) Matt flies to London to live with his sister Shannon ( Claire Forlani ) and her husband Steve ( Marc Warren ) and their young son . Steve's rowdy brother Pete ( Charlie Hunnam ) interrupts Matt's arrival with a demand for money from his older brother and reluctantly accepts the company of the new Yank Matt in order to gain cash from Steve . What ensues is Matt's introduction to the GSE ( Green Street Elite ) , a firm of men who defend the honor and success of their chosen soccer team : there are many such firms of street violence gangs who vie for ranking within the city . Matt is plunged into this violent situation and learns form Pete the importance of gang stance : always protect your brothers and never flee a fight . The story grows increasingly complex and intense as we learn the backgrounds for hate and intolerance , one of these hates is for journalists and when it is discovered that Matt was a journalism major at Harvard the news nearly causes Matt's life . But Matt slowly identifies with the firm and grows into a sense of individuality that he has never had , giving him the ability to face the realities of his father's absence and to understand the precarious marriage of his sister whose husband is a ' reformed ' hooligan . In the end there is a ' justification ' for the violence witnessed , but the audience must be willing to view that justification from an altered stance . The film is paced well and the cast is excellent , with special kudos to Elijah Wood , Claire Forlani , Marc Warren , Charley Hunnan , and to the fine supporting cast members including Leo Gregory as the unfortunate snitch , Terence Jay as the coke-addicted Harvard roommate , and a large cast of ' firm members ' whose fighting techniques are well choreographed and captured by cinematographer Alexander Buono . Like THE FIGHT CLUB this film is not for all audiences , but the messages underneath all of the violence are well worth thought . Grady Harp
An Old-Fashioned Period Piece Makes a Fine Film	FLYBOYS is a pleasure to watch - going back into World War I history that deals with actual events yet takes the time to introduce unforgettable characters and romantic situations while giving the viewer a spectacular view of the first flying fighter planes . Yes , it has its flaws in technical lines , but it has a strong , committed cast and a storyline that flows seamlessly to the end . Tony Bill uses his resources from his countless cinematic experiences in adapting a story by Blake T . Evans ( screenplay by Phil Sears , David S . Ward , and Evans ) to recreate the legendary Lafayette Escadrille , a disparate group of young Americans who volunteered for the French military to become the country's first fighter pilots before the USA entered World War I . He manages to find the world atmosphere during the Great War , a time when young American boys who had no chance for significance in the tough times USA to go ' over there ' to fight the Germans . He begins with the lad Blaine Rawlings ( James Franco ) who has just lost his family's farm to the bank , with William Jensen ( Philip Winchester ) who must live up to his family's fame as heroes , with Briggs Lowry ( Tyler Labine ) whose father sees him as a complete loss to his wealthy gentrified family , with Eddie Beagle ( David Ellison ) who leaves for war with his sweetheart's picture against his breast , with frustrated black fighter Eugene Skinner ( Abdul Salis ) - a crew of boys who become bonded through the efforts of the French Captain Thenault ( Jean Reno ) and the loner flyer Reed Cassidy ( Martin Henderson ) . Planes are designed , the boys are rigorously trained , and off they go to missions never before flown , missions that waste some , and make heroes of others . Along the way Rawlings meets Lucienne ( Jennifer Decker ) , a French girl who speaks no English but whose heart emboldens Rawlings to feats of heroism . The fighting scenes are terrific to watch as they seem to be done with toys , so light are the aircraft that started flying fighters . Yes , there are problems in depicting these missions because there are no stunt men who would dare fly such machines even for a movie . But Tony Bill keeps our attention with his direction and with the aerial cinematography of Henry Braham . The costumes are excellent and the musical score by Trevor Rabin recalls the period well . James Franco and his fellow actors offer solid performances . This is a bit of the past that is well to re-examine : FLYBOYS provides an evening of nostalgia and a fine story though at 140 minutes it could have been edited ) . Grady Harp
A Surprisingly Good Movie !	Like many viewers who tire easily of the ' big whammies ' that get all the media blitz , this reviewer waited to see KING KONG until the glut of audience overflow in the theaters gave way to private home DVD watching . And then the main reason for watching it was the impressive list of good reviews here on Amazon . com and from some fellow reviewers . Much to my surprise for a person ( read curmudgeon ) who doesn't usually go for sci-fi super hero action movies , I quite liked this film . It is grossly in need of editing its 3 hour plus time frame , but the remake of the old movie is a good story well told with some fine actors making it all a joy to see . One reason for the success of this version was director Peter Jackson's decision to keep it in the 1930s in the same time frame of the original . The recreation of the Depression is quite effective and energizes the need to believe in this fantasy film . Naomi Watts yet again proves that even in roles opposite a computer generated Kong she can still creates illusions as an actress far better than most . She is a fine heroine for the story . But the choices of using Jack Black as the movie producer and Adrien Brody as the writer were VERY strong decisions . For those who equate Jack Black with potty mouth dumb movies his performance will surprise in its sensitivity . And then adding such fine actors as Thomas Kretschmann , Jamie Bell , Kyle Chandler , Evan Parke , John Sumner etc offers substance to the film . Though the special effects are excellent , the middle third of the film once the crew is on Skull Island and we are endlessly confronted with hungry dinosaurs is soooooooo long that it becomes tempting to stop watching the film . But finally we realize the purpose was giving time for Watts to create a credible relationship with Kong and all is forgiven . The tenderness of the story makes it work and there is a lot to be said about understanding , caring , relating , greed , and animal brutality that make this film ring true . KING KONG is simply so much better than expected that despite is excesses it still is a very good movie for all that ! Grady Harp
Restoration of Dignity to Native Americans , Long Overdue	James Fenimore Cooper's trusty old nineteenth century novel ' The Last of the Mohicans ' has provided a surprisingly sound springboard for a film that tries and succeeds in restoring a profound respect for the Native Americans . Yes , it is a story about the Indians and their culture desecrated by the arrival of European entrepreneurs and colonists all relating to Hawkeye / Nathaniel Poe ( Daniel Day-Lewis ) , who as a child was taken by the Mohawk tribe and raised by wise Chingachgook ( Russell Means ) with the graceful skills and philosophy of the Native Americans . And it is through his eyes that we are brought into the universe through the eyes of the Indians . The story is well known and needn't be elaborated once again . Suffice it say that Hawkeye becomes the scout who leads British family Munro including Colonel ( Maurice Roëves ) and his daughters Cora ( Madeleine Stowe ) and Alice ( Jodhi May ) into upstate New York and along the way find altercations with the French and with the Huron Indians , especially one Magua ( Wes Studi ) whose loathing for Munro's devastation of his village drives him to vengeance against the entire Munro family . Hawkeye and his ally Uncas ( Eric Schweig ) protect their lieges while steadfastly holding to the honor of their heritage . And of course during the harrowing events Hawkeye and Cora fall in love and Hawkeye takes great risks against his own life to ultimately defend Cora and her family . Yes , there are many battle scenes , great reenactment of the scenery of the novel , and villains in all camps that provide the stormy progress of the novel . But it is in the quiet moments where Chingachgook speaks about the Great Spirit , the sanctity of nature , and his waiting to join the Great Council in the sky as the last of the Mohicans that the film's power is best communicated . The acting is very fine and the cinematography is splendid . This is a film worth seeing , one whose 117 minutes fly by leaving the viewer with a renewed respect for Native American philosophy .

Confusion and Terror from Multiple Vantages	The story line of VANTAGE POINT is a brief one : a summit meeting on terrorism aimed at addressing the differences between the Arab world and the Western world is taking place in Salamanca , Spain and the arrival of the President of the United States is greeted with assassination attempts , terrorist explosions , and car chases . The difference in this thriller from the many others of the same genre is the use of telling the story from at least five different vantage points - the news reporters ( Sigourney Weaver , Zoë Saldana and Staff ) , the CIA ( Dennis Quaid , Matthew Fox , et al with William Hurt as the President ) , a group of terrorists , an American bystander with camera ( Forest Whitaker ) , and the viewing public . Things are not as they initially seem and the more times the story is rerun through repetition of the incident , the more information is added . Based on a story by Barry Levy and directed by Pete Travis the film could become tiresome in its use of repeated reruns , but given the quality of the cast and the twists and turns as the ' plot ' is further elucidated makes the story more of an investigation of Intelligence forces from all involved countries and drives home the reason ' terrorism ' is so terrifying . Some of the peripheral cast members are particularly fine - Bruce McGill , Edgar Ramirez , Saïd Taghmaoui , Ayelet Zurer , and Eduardo Noriega among others . It is a film that takes patience on the part of the viewer , but staying with it until the end results in some very fine entertainment . Grady Harp
A Meditation on Death and Dying : Reconstructing a Family	Bruce Wagner's screen adaptation of his novel I'M LOSING YOU has some of the more intelligent dialogue to be encountered in a film . Since Wagner also directed this little gem , brimming over with excellent actors , we can be assured that his message of death as a necessary component in the cycle of life is intact . Despite the dour content of the story this film actually leads to a credible sense of how deaths can ultimately be redemptive : it is all in how vulnerable we allow ourselves to become in coping with this life change . The story is focused on a wealthy Los Angeles family headed by television producer of sci-fi series Perry Krohn ( Frank Langella ) , married to a psychiatrist Diantha ( Salome Jens ) despite having a ' helper ' mistress Mona ( Amanda Donahue ) , ' stepfather ' of a disillusioned daughter Rachel ( Rosanna Arquette ) and a has-been actor son Bertie ( Andrew McCarthy ) who makes a living selling back insurance policies to AIDS patients : the father has been diagnosed with inoperable cancer and his attempts to set his will in order is the catalyst for the story . The son is separated from his ex-wife , a disturbed addicted woman Lidia ( Gina Gershon ) and the two fight over custody of their young child Tiffany ( Aria Noelle Curzon ) . Complicating matters is the fact that Rachel has never been told until now that her biologic father murdered her mother and committed suicide AND that her stepfather had a onetime sexual fling with her mother . Things begin to consistently fall apart : the son falls in love with one of the AIDS victims , Aubrey ( Elizabeth Perkins ) , to whom he sells insurance who has a son and lives in horror that she will soon die and her son will be abandoned . About this same time Tiffany is killed in an automobile accident , the fault of her drugged out mother , and Rachel embraces her Jewish heritage by learning how to perform the body cleansing ritual performed as a loving act on the dead - the dead being Tiffany . And at this peak of crises , Aubrey dies in a hospital , succumbing to every complication known to AIDS . How this fractured family comes together in the midst of all these losses and lifetime barriers to communication serves as the resolution of this complex but infinitely interesting story . The actors all give bravura performances , relishing the smart dialogue and the multilayered meanings to each encounter captured by the fine cinematographer Rob Sweeney . This may not be a film for everyone , but for those seeking more form a film than entertainment will find much food for thought here . Recommended . Grady Harp
A Warm , Sensitive , Genteel Human Comedy	' Le Hasard Fait Bien Les Choses ' ( AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT ) is a thoroughly surprising film . The marketing ploy makes this very well written ( Julie Gilbert and Philippe Le Dem ) and well directed ( Lorenzo Gabriele ) seem to be something it is not - a flashy fleshy gay flick from France . But what the viewer discovers soon after the film begins is a very tender story about the conflicts older gay men face in attempting to manage professional lives with personal lives . Jean-Pierre Muller ( the gifted Jean-Claude Brialy ) is a highly respected professor in his late 50s who is about to be honored for his achievements in teaching by the University . He is a proper gentleman and kind human being who hides his personal life : he is gay and has a quasi live-in lover Armando ( Antonio Interlandi ) in a very successful though closeted relationship for appearance's sake ( even his longtime housekeeper Ana - Elena Noverraz - apparently doesn't know ) ! All is smooth until a handsome young lad Antoine ( Julien Bravo ) is put before the court system as a minor who has lost his parents and needs an assigned guardian . In a strange law the judge ( Anne Kreis ) selects a random name ( Jean-Pierre , of course ) to be the guardian . Though Jean-Pierre is reluctant to accept guardianship for the somewhat feisty lad ( who is encouraged by his girlfriend Samantha - Lorriane Cherpillod - to try to get some cash from the court order ) , he discovers that he cannot appeal the decision for three months time . Desperate to continue his progress towards his desired honorary degree AND to keep his sexuality secret form the courts fearing they may hamper his chances , Jean-Pierre calls his ' arranged wife ' Alice ( Sabine Haudepin ) , whom he married to aid Alice's immigration status years ago , to be his ' front ' . Alice , just dumped by her lover Grégoire ( Juan-Antonio Crespillo ) agrees , moves in much to Armando's chagrin , and the facade is in place . What occurs in this ' arrangement ' is the resolution of each of the individual components in a manner that shows us that dignity , love , self-respect , and honesty are infectious and benefit all of us . The cast is uniformly excellent without a weak link . Jean-Claude Brialy is superb as the self-conscious but loving centerpiece , and the air of comedy and sensitivity conveyed by Sabine Haudepin , Antonio Interlandi , Elena Noverraz , newcomer and very promising Julien Bravo , and Anne Kreis are pitch perfect without ever stooping to stereotypes . This is a film for both gay and straight audiences who appreciate the manifestations of love , healthy relationships , caring , social problems , and understanding would enjoy . In French with English subtitles and unfortunately no extras on the DVD . Recommended . Grady Harp
A Tense , Moody , Atmospheric Thriller	Robert Moresco ( ' Crash ' ) is proving to be a fine storyteller with a definite style of his own . 10TH & WOLF , written by both Moresco and Allan Steele and directed by Moresco appears on the shelves of DVDs as one of those films that makes us wonder why it didn't do well on the theater screens : it is well written , beautifully directed , has a cast that is consistently fine , and unravels a family involved in organized crime theme as well as any movie out there . Moresco very wisely starts his story in the burning oil fields of Kuwait during Desert Storm where Marine sargeant Tommy ( James Marsden , doing his finest work since his brilliant portrayal in THE 24TH HOUR ) drives his Hummer through the desert , coming to grips with the absurdity of war , a key turn in his personality causing him to be dishonorably discharged for his refusal to take part in that ridiculous war game . He is given a deal : FBI agents Horvath ( Brian Dennehy ) and Thornton ( Leo Rossi ) visit his cell stateside and offer him clemency if he helps them capture a big drug dealer Reggio ( Francesco Salvi ) in Tommy's hometown of Philadelphia . Tommy had escaped the organized crime scene by joining the Marines , but is suddenly returned to his family occupation as an undercover agent with a wire . Tommy's brother Vincent ( Brad Renfro ) and his cousin Joey ( Giovanni Ribisi ) welcome his return and begin plotting ways to off Reggio . Beatings and murders begin to occur : Joey is a bit on the mad side and plunges his boys into messes that become like quicksand . How the family bonds over losses to big crime and vendettas , and how that lifestyle affects parents ( Lesley Ann Warren ) and victims turned girlfriends ( Piper Perabo ) leaving the drive to survive as the paramount goal is the run of the plot . There are plenty of cameos ( Dennis Hopper , Val Kilmer , Dash Mihok etc ) to round out the dark atmosphere , but the strength of the film lies strongly on the shoulders of Marsden , Ribisi and Renfro and they handle their roles exceptionally well . This is yet another big crime story but one that grips the audience's attention and holds it to the final twisted end . Strong violence and language , but a testy and tightly woven story with many unspoken metaphors . Grady Harp
Fate , Destiny , Happenstance : Keys to a Lovely , Quiet little Film	TOUCH OF FATE is not one of the big Indie movies successes , nor is it a theatrical release that garnered wide audiences . Instead it is a quiet film about fate bonding people who are blindly searching for connection . Writer / director Rebecca Cook knows how to weave an intricate story into a canvas that is , well , luminous - and she does this without the usual hoopla of big name stars or expensive locations settings . Coincidence or fate like a magnet draws the lives of three people into a bond created by a tragedy : a woman ( Teri Hatcher ) returns to her small North Carolina town in hopes of reclaiming a love ( Daniel Green ) , an entertainment lawyer ( Robert C . Treveiler ) returns home out of guilt to his dying mother having attempted to escape his past for years , and a clairvoyant boy ( Cody Newton ) struggles with the sudden and tragic death of his father and overbearing love of his single mother . These individually needy people find succor in circumstances that hold lesson of coping with need , and finding forgiveness with the power of love . Simple story , well written , and directed with control and care by Cook . Yet the genuine surprise of this film is the ensemble acting by a cast of fine actors . Teri Hatcher has a following for ' Desperate Housewives ' but here she proves that she is truly a fine actress whose face communicates as much inner turmoil and emotion as the entire script . She is worth watching and the film deserves more attention . Grady Harp
' Curiosity killed the cat ' and others	UNTRACEABLE is a thriller that takes our current obsession with the Internet and our hunger for the grisly ' eyewitness ' matter found on certain blogsites to an extreme that is at times difficult to watch - but maybe a bit too close to apparent public interest to ignore . Written by Robert Fyvolent , Mark Brinker and Allison Burnett ( a fine novelist whose ' Christopher : A Tale of Seduction ' and ' The House Beautiful ' continue to stir interest ) and directed with unrelenting tension by Gregory Hoblit , the story revolves around a misguided youth , angry over the police and media handling of his father's recent suicide , who draws attention to his serial murders using internet techniques that make the viewers of his repulsive site co - conspirators in his streaming versions of these pertinent deaths . Diane Lane steps out of her glamor roles to appear as a single mother cyber cop whose intelligence and intuition bring her as close as one can get to the resolution of a crime . She is ably supported by a the underused Billy Burke as a fellow policeman , Mary Beth Hurt as her grounded mother , Colin Hanks as her sidekick cop , and the disturbing character role performance of young Joseph Cross . Yes , for those who are intimately associated with the intricacies of internet jargon and possibilities there are probably a number of misfires . But for the general audience this little film is well crafted , terrifying in its imaginative story , and acted by a fine ensemble cast . Worth watching if only to see how deadly serious computer ' games ' can be . Grady Harp
The Quiet Before , The Turbulence Of , and The Aftermath Following a Storm	Teenage hormones are at peak level in this nice little German film ' Sommersturm ' or ' Summer Storm ' and the result is a set of mini-crises that tumble young people all the time : first sexual attraction , the ambiguity of close friendships , the trials and lessons of first sexual encounters , and the manner in which teenagers survive their sexual decisions amongst their peers . Director Marco Kreuzpaintner and writer ( with Thomas Bahmann ) set this attractive coming of age film on the playing field of crewing , a sport that demands full attention and intense cooperation from every team mate . Two teams from Bavaria , one of boys and the other of girls , take off for a summer camp training session where they encounter another crew from Berlin , a crew that just happens to be composed of gay young boys . The Bavarian boys ' crew team is lead by two long-term friends - Tobi ( Robert Stadlober ) and Achim ( Kostja Ullmann ) - and while their friendship is strong , Tobi is discovering that his feelings for Achim go far deeper . The two share stories about their girlfriends - Anke ( and beautiful Alicja Bachleda-Curus ) and Sandra ( Miriam Morgenstern ) who head the girl's crew team . At the summer camp Tobi's feelings for Achim deepen and the influence of the team of very handsome young gay boys on the opposing team only serve to heighten the tension . Tobi eventually has an encounter with a particularly tender and understanding Leo ( Marlon Kittel ) and as the questions begin to arise a violent storm makes the entire group flee for cover . The manner in which Tobi comes out to his team and to Achim is the very tender dénouement of the story . The storm raging in Tobi ( as well as in other members of the team ) settles into the aftermath . Some viewers may find this film too explicit for general viewing but for this viewer the encounters all around remain tasteful and touching . The director seems to be telling us that the ' first experience ' , whether that is gay or straight , is or can be traumatic as well as fulfilling . The cast does well : there are many very beautiful young boys and girls who play their roles with a natural simplicity and allure . For a young director ( only 29 years old and this is his fifth film ) Kreutzpainter seems to have a solid future .
An Epic Film with a Heart	KINGDOM OF HEAVEN is not just another Hollywood epic with a cast of thousands laying pillage to the earth and fellow man . Yes , it is a mammoth production with enough spectacular sets , battle scenes , violence and atmosphere to satisfy even the most ravenous Big Picture appetite . But is also has a fine script ( written by William Monahan ) that elects to focus on a rather intimate series of stories that have sensitivity and tenderness and , perhaps more importantly , offers some historical background for understanding the ongoing battles over the city of Jerusalem . Balian ( Orlando Bloom ) is a recently widowed blacksmith in France in the 12th century whose long absent nobleman father Godfrey surprisingly informs him that Balian is his son and pleads with him to accompany him to Jerusalem for the Crusades , a challenge Balian slowly accepts . Godfrey is killed in battle but manages to bestow his knighthood on Balian before he dies , leaving Balian to assume the important role of humanist in the multifaceted struggle for power that exists in Jerusalem . King Baldwin of Jerusalem ( Edward Norton ) lives a holy life hiding his leprosy behind a mask and bids Balian to protect the people of the city of Jerusalem against not only the evil undermining of the Knights Templar led by Reynald ( Brendan Gleeson ) and the incipient King of Jerusalem Guy de Lusignan ( Marton Csokas ) , but also against the Saracens led by Saladin ( Ghassan Massoud ) . Balian is assisted by mentor Tiberias ( Jeremy Irons ) and by his innocent love for Sybilla ( Eva Green ) who unfortunately is the wife of Guy ! Balian remains true to his ideals of knighthood . The military logistics of the various battles are a bit confusing to follow as the variation in uniforms is minimal . But it is Balian's ever-present protection of the people of Jerusalem that leads to the historical moment that ends the siege of the city well described in history books . The film ends in a manner that emphasizes the importance of humanity over greed , lust , war , and destruction and opens the path for compassion for the centuries long schism that still afflicts the holy city . The cast is excellent with small roles made large by such fine actors as Michael Sheen , David Thwelis , Velibor Topic , among others . The musical score is a magnificent blend of Western ecclesiastic themes ( including Bach ! ) with Eastern ones under the writing direction of Harry Gregson-Williams . John Mathieson is responsible for the vivid cinematography . But major kudos go to Ridley Scott for making what could have been a loud blood and guts period piece into a film with a quiet heart and soul . KINGDOM OF HEAVEN is an inspiring film to see .

Learning About Life Through the Eyes of a Voyeur Teenager	Israeli Writer / director Savi Gavison has a unique concept about the discoveries and joys and travails of coming of age and he makes this tender little story come to life with simplicity and honesty and a large dose of human kindness . The multiple awards this movie garnered are very well deserved : perhaps now that it is readily available on DVD will hopefully bring it to the attention of a larger audience . HA-ASONOT SHEL NINA ( NINA'S TRAGEDIES ) takes us on a journey with teenager Nadav ( a quietly superb Aviv Elkabeth ) whose home life is stressful : his mother Alona ( Anat Waxman ) has thrown out her husband and takes on lovers like flies to flypaper . Alona's sister Nina ( the luminously beautiful Ayelet Zurer ) - Nadav's aunt - has relationship troubles with her intended husband Haimon ( Yoram Hattab ) yet finally marries him , much to the dissatisfaction of Nadav who is privately in love with Nina ( his first sensation of attraction and lust ) . Nadav has a friend Menahem ( Dov Navon ) with whom he spends his time as a peeping tom , watching the vagaries of his mother and Nina . After Nina's marriage , Haimon is killed in the ongoing violence in Tel Aviv and Nina is destroyed emotionally : Alona sends the more than willing Nadav to live with his aunt , an act that only enforces his passion for Nina . But soon Nina begins to see visions of Haimon running naked in the streets ( ! ) and is befriended by a handsome Avinoam ( Alon Abutbul ) whose girlfriend Lihi ( Osnat Fishman ) is a successful artist . Nina and Avinoam have a passionate but brief affair ( causing deep bitterness in the jealous Nadav ) , but the affair is ended when Nina ' sees ' the face / ghost of Haimon at her window and Nina longs for the return of Haimon , knowing now that she is pregnant with his child . Navad engages Menahem to help him resolve Nina's new tragedy , but Menahem has found a girlfriend Galina ( Jenya Dodina ) and has his own ' tragedy ' when Galina returns to her ex-lover Alex ( Yoram Hattab again ! ) , and it is Menahem's tragedy that leads Navad to the discovery that the very strange Alex is the ' ghost ' of Haimon that Nina has been seeing . The story becomes more complex as Nina delivers her baby , Navad's father is taken back by his mother when his diagnosis of cancer is made known , and the mixed set of tragedies intertwine for an ending that surprises everyone . If the plot sounds convoluted , it is ! But the fact that the story is from the obsessively maintained diary of Nadav makes it all connect in the loveliest of ways . The cast is outstanding and the tenor of the times in Tel Aviv is accurately and realistically portrayed and for once allows the constant conflict to be simply background for a story that deals with equally traumatic personal issues - at least in the eyes of an impressionable young teenager . There is much wisdom here , but there is also considerable fine entertainment in a film that sees human foibles as comic as they are tragic . Watching NINA'S TRAGEDIES is a complete pleasure .

A Timely Topic , An Uplifting Film	Sensitive director Patricia Riggen has , in LA MISMA LUNA ( UNDER THE SAME MOON ) , succeeded in creating a story about the travails of the illegal immigrants from Mexico that serves as a reminder to all of us that one of the reasons for the obsession to take the risks of crossing the border is an attempt to find a better life . While this story concept is by no means a novel one , writer Ligiah Villalobos has provided a script that avoids taking sides , but instead concentrates on creating wholly believable characters caught in the web of immigration - from both sides of the wall . This little film from Mexico is , above all , a film about love , about courage and about resilience and is portrayed by a very fine cast in every role . Rosario ( Kate del Castillo ) is a single mother who crossed the border four years earlier in order to support her young son Carlitos ( a superb young actor , Adrian Alonso ) and her ailing mother by working double jobs as a housekeeper in Los Angeles . She keeps in touch with Carlitos with weekly phone calls and sends him gifts as well as money and love . When Rosario's mother dies , Carlitos takes life into his own hands and plans to cross the border with a little help from his experience with a wise old lady Coyota ( Carmen Salinas ) who aids immigrants . With his savings in his backpack and his heart aimed toward Los Angeles he sets out on his journey and is thwarted at every turn . He is picked up by two Hispanic students from the US ( America Ferrara and Jesse Garcia ) whose attempt to transport Carlitos is halted at the border - with the little Carlitos hidden under the seat of the now towed away car . Carlos escapes from the car in El Paso , meets up with some illegal workers who are arrested , leaving the hidden Carlitos with a reluctant companion Enrique ( Eugenio Derbez ) who is able to aid Carlitos ( reluctantly ! ) to escape to Los Angeles . Through many ' jobs ' and untoward situations Carlitos finally finds his way to the spot where he hopes he will meet his mother . The rhythms of the cinematography , the sets , the flavors of both sides of the border , and the music that accompanies the film all contribute to making this story real and believable - and VERY touching . While Kate del Castillo is the major star of the film , it is the performance by Adrian Alonso that remains in the mind long after the credits are shown . Some viewers may find this film a bit too ' novella-like ' , but the magic that Patricia Riggen pulls from her large cast and verismo directing style will touch the hearts of most everyone . A fine little reminder of the other aspects of the Immigration topic ! Grady Harp
' Dance 5 , Story 3 '	ONE LAST DANCE appears to be a film for dancers , either active or retired , wannabees or romanticists . There is some terrific Brazilian influenced music from Stacy Widelitz that enhances much of the corps dancing and some beautiful moments of cinematography making the most of a bare ballet studio rehearsal hall - both of which add what dreaminess this low budget film has to offer . Written and directed and produced and acted by Lisa Niemi the story involves the return to the boards by three retired dancers ( Lisa Niemi , Patrick Swayze , George de la Pena - all three are dancers in real life ) to pay homage to the gifts of a highly regarded yet now dead choreographer . The three left dancing seven years prior to the story for personal reasons , mostly involving lack of confidence and personal issues that affected each tangentially . They return to a company to perform a dance by the dead choreographer and the rest of the slim story is how these out of shape hoofers regain the healing magic of dancing . The corps of ballet dancers assembled for this film is exceptionally fine for a pickup group : Rasta Thomas , Desmond Richardson , Kathryn Bradney , Tai Jiminez , Bambi Swayze , Jamie Bishton , Stephanie Slater , Heather Thompson , Dwight Rhoden and Yosuke Mino deserve special mention . The scenes of dancing vary depending on the choreography of each of four artists - Alonzo King , Dwight Rhoden , Patsy Swayze , and Doug Varone . But in the end to be less than a documentary about the rigors and rewards of dancing there must be a well-acted story based on a sensitive script and that is where the film is shaky and a bit self indulgent . Swayze , Niemi , de la Pena take the roles as far as they go , but in the end the story is much ado about very little . Yet there is some gorgeous dance work well filmed that will satisfy even the most particular critic . The DVD added features include some insights into the difficulty and final rewards of bringing ONE LAST DANCE to the screen , and in these comments there is more story than that found in the script .

Poetry as the Healing Force in Time of War - and After	VOICES IN WARTIME is a documentary that has many aspects : it is an important investigation into how poets have responded to war from the Civil War through the two World Wars , Korean and Vietnam Wars and it is an homage to the fallen and to those who have been permanently damaged by war's dissection of the psyche , whether that be called combat fatigue , shell shock , battle rattle or the now accepted term Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome . One has only to read the works of Walt Whitman , Wilfred Owen , Siegfried Sassoon , Langston Hughes to find the core of this deeply moving project and film . Filmmaker Rick King has created a platform for which poets and commentators , scholars and photographers and explores the close relationship between anti-war protest and the poetry that has grown out of such feelings . This film is not a compendium of works praising Old Glory or making the world safe for democracy : this is a conversation among poets and their works with newsreel footage and stills of the wars of our past and present , thoughts that descry the atrocities of war and the rage it invokes . It is difficult to watch , but it is important to absorb . This is the portal through which author Sam Hamill is seen organizing the activist group , Poets Against the War . And the impact is strong . Not all of the poetry read is great and much of it comes from the pens of the untrained . But all of the works and voices and images in King's film cannot help but touch the heart and the conscience . It needs to be seen . Grady Harp
Shocking , Repulsive . . . and Fascinating	AN American CRIME is a problematic little reenactment of a real criminal case of child abuse dating back to 1965 . The story is horrifying and while the film places the facts in our faces , the impact of the film is out of focus . This is due to the script that elects to glaze over the motivational aspects of a brutal crime in favor of attempting to investigate fully the mindset of both the perpetrator and the victims . Were it not for some sterling performances by Catherine Keener and Ellen Page this film might be easily dismissed : the strength of these actresses to overcome a weak script and manage to involve us is much to their credit as artists . Indiana , 1965 , and Gertrude Baniszewski ( Catherine Keener ) is a ' borderline ' single mother of several children who is asked to take care of Sylvia ( Ellen Page ) and Jennie Likens ( Hayley McFarland ) while the girls parents remain on the road as carnies , promising to send checks to help support their farmed out children . Gertrude is a woman of loose morals who adds babies to her large family during liaisons with young men like the itinerant Dennis ( James Franco ) . Gertrude takes in laundry to support her household and requires her young children to work toward the same goal . A friction develops between Sylvia and Jenny and the children by Gertrude's illicit adventures as well as covert sexual similarities surfacing in her children and at ' family meetings ' Gertrude doles out punishment for Sylvia - punishment including cigarette burns , coke bottle insertions , branding etc . - all of which are undeserved and eventually lead to Sylvia's imprisonment in the basement where Gertrude and her children and their friends daily torture Sylvia . Eventually Sylvia dies and Gertrude and family are brought to court for charges of first-degree murder and variations thereof . The court proceedings ( under the leadership of lawyer Leroy K . New played by Bradley Whitford ) provide the story drivers as each allegation is then acted out by flashbacks until the verdicts are reached . Catherine Keener is superb as the deranged , maladaptive Gertrude and Ellen Page adds yet another feather to her cap in a role that in another actor's hands could have been over the top . Writer / director Tommy O'Haver ( the script was written with the aid of Irene Turner ) does manage to show us the facts of this atrocity yet fails to go inside the characters to give us the psychobiographies this film has the potential for illuminating . It may well repel some viewers , but it does bring to the forefront a crime that is all too common in this country . Grady Harp
What if the Draft were Reinstated ?	The Draft as a means for supplying the armed forces with manpower ended with the Vietnam War . DAY ZERO is a thought provoking film that raises the question of how today's youth would respond were the Draft reinstated as a result of the ever-growing Iraq War . Writer Robert Malkani and director Bryan Gunnar Cole respond to the question by creating three characters , long time friends , but each with a different response to the forced servitude in a wartime situation . As with any film dealing with controversial subject matter there are ideas presented that will disturb just about everyone no matter their stance on compulsive servitude , and it is that aspect that makes this film work so well in jolting our thinking . The time is New York , now , and the media has just announced the reinstatement of the Draft to cope with the drained national volunteer army . Three friends receive their draft notices simultaneously : successful lawyer George Rifkin ( Chris Klein ) whose marriage to a cancer survivor wife Molly ( Ginnifer Goodwin ) is part of the solid state of life he resists changing ; fantasy writer Aaron Feller ( Elijah Wood ) who is in progress on a novel he must finish while his life is otherwise rather on shaky ground , controlled by his loopy therapist ( Ally Sheedy ) ; cab driver James Dixon ( Jon Bernthal ) who has a past history of being a loner and attempting to control violent behavior . The gamut runs from refusal to even consider the draft ( Rifkin ) to being nonplussed by the disruption to his psyche ( Feller ) to gung-ho ready to fight Dixon . The three young men have thirty days to Day Zero and in those thirty days each undergoes profound changes and introspection and self-discovery that very keenly illustrates the effect that such a governmental edict can have on today's youth . This is ensemble acting that rivals that of any fine film : there are no stars here , only actors portraying emotional changes that are universal in nature . And for a first film by director Cole it succeeds on most levels . In addition to the work of the four main actors there are fine cameos by young Sofia Vassilieva and by Elisabeth Moss . The film is meant to raise questions , challenge our current complacency and our views of the concept or war and military obligation . That it is disturbing is part of the power of the work .

A Tasty Little Film About Tradition - and Other Challenges !	A very strong cast and an excellent production crew brings USHPIZIN into the realm of classics that will endure . The story may be simple but to non-orthodox Jews it is one at times confusing but always fascinating in introducing cultural traditions that are unknown to many of us . In the case of USHPIZIN that tradition is Succoth , a seven-day holiday honoring the time when the wandering Israelites were surviving in the desert on the way to the Holy Land . Each family must make a succah ( a meager temporary shelter ) and celebrate with Palm frond dates , myrtle , citron , etc . We are introduced to Rabbi Moshe ( Shuli Rand ) and his wife Malli ( Michal Bat Sheva Rand ) who are so poor they cannot afford a succah much less the accoutrements to celebrate Succoth . The both pray for miracles and one comes in the form of cash allowing them a succah etc . But also along come two escaped convicts ( one of whom is Moshe's ex-friend from the past ) and ask for shelter - the tradition of Succoth includes never turning away guests ( ' ushzipin ' ) . Naturally Moshe and Malli must take them in and the problems slowly arise , problems that challenge tradition , religion , and personal welfare . The marriage of music , fine camera work , superb acting , beautiful costume design , and the magic of learning about ethnic traditions make this little film irresistible . Its story may be small but the metaphors are enormous ! Highly recommended . In Hebrew with English subtitles . Grady Harp
Love is the Bridge Between This Life and the Next	Thorton Wilder's novel of ruminations about the quality of love and the extremes to which it can be played out is more of a philosophical meditation than a story and this is probably the reason many people feel upended by Mary McGuckian's film , a project she both adapted for the screen and directed . If this film seems a bit on the static side there is a reason : the tale is a testimony before court by Brother Juniper ( Gabriel Byrne ) about his investigation into the deaths of five people when the rope bridge of San Luis Rey outside Lima , Peru collapsed . Brother Juniper stands before the Archbishop of Peru ( Robert De Niro ) and the Viceroy of Peru ( F . Murray Abraham ) and poses the question as to whether the incident was an act of God or just a simple accident . In order to present his case he has researched the lives of the five who died ( mentioning those five would ruin the suspense of the story ) . We learn about The Marquesa ( Kathy Bates ) whose daughter has departed for Spain to marry well ( the Marquesa is starving for the love of her estranged daughter ) ; the kindhearted Abbess ( Geraldine Chaplin ) who gives refuge to the unwanted including identical twin men Manuel and Esteban ( the mute Mark and Michael Polish ) and Pepita ( Adriana Domínguez ) . We also meet Uncle Pio ( Harvey Keitel ) who serves as a harlequin for the court and raises Camila Villegas AKA La Perichola ( Pilar López de Ayala ) who loves the stage and the accoutrements more than she loves Uncle Pio . Through the kindness of the Abbess , Pepita is loaned to the Marquesa's household as a surrogate daughter , the twins share their devotion to the court until a tragedy separates them , La Perichola is impregnated by the Viceroy and banned from the city ( she raises her little boy , hiding from the world because of her post-partum smallpox disfigurement ) , and Uncle Pio eventually assumes responsibility of the child out of fatherly love . Five of these people who are true to love's power cross the fateful bridge . Brother Juniper is condemned by the Inquisition for his treason and the meaning of the story is revealed . The cast is heavy on big names and while they make the most out of the stiff script , they never really touch us the way Wilder's novel characters did . But the trappings of the film are grand and accurately portrayed , the scenery is beautiful , and the costumes are some of the finest period costumes in many a film . This is one of those films that requires careful concentration from the audience , a willingness to not be disturbed by the at times static proscenium stage feeling of the setting , but the rewards of understanding the message are great . There are some fine performances here and the film is definitely worth seeing . It is more demanding than most films - and that is just fine ! Grady Harp
Finding Self	WHOLE NEW THING is another fine little film from Canada , utilizing an excellent cast of Canadian actors to present a modern day conundrum about identity in a manner more sensitive than most other films addressing the subject . Director / writer ( with actor Daniel MacIvor ) Amnon Buchbinder has created a series of characters , seemingly disparate in age and outlook , who each has a problem coping with who they actually are , and with great skill this story interweaves these fascinating people , isolated by the frigid planes of Nova Scotia into a complex puzzle that answers far more questions about identity than is at first apparent . Emerson ( a strong debut for Aaron Webber ) is the thirteen-year-old son of environmentalist / post-hippie parents Kaya ( Rebecca Jenkins ) and Rog ( Robert Joy ) whose creative look at life has provided home schooling for Emerson , encouraged his gift for writing , but now find that there are gaps in Emerson's education that suggest enrolling him in the local Middle School might mend . Kaya and Rog are in a stale marriage : each has needs the other can't appreciate . Emerson enjoys his isolation and is not eager to move into the ' mainstream ' by attending school . Kaya visits the middle school and meets teacher Don Grant ( Daniel MacIvor ) whom she invites to her home to meet and impress Emerson . Don is a bright , lovable teacher who has failed in gay relationships , relegating his needs to visits to park restrooms . When Don comes to dinner , Emerson is impressed with Don's acceptance of Emerson's outlook and decides to give the school a chance . Emerson , long-haired and androgynous in appearance , suffers ridicule at school but finds considerable solace in the classroom atmosphere Don Grant adapts to suit Emerson's intelligent needs . Don is 42 and Emerson is 13 and while they become friends , Emerson develops his first ' crush ' on Don . And while this is happening Kaya meets young stud Denny ( the always excellent Callum Keith Rennie ) and begins an affair . Many moments of electric snaps occur among all of the characters ( a matter of whose crisis is more threatening ! ) and the manner in which each of the confrontations with each character and conjoined demons occur begin to resolve the seemingly improbable results that alter the growth of each . Part of the success of a film dealing with such subject matter is the manner in which each of the stories is told . There is no crude acting out , no pat answers , and no unnecessary ' drama ' for drama's sake . This is a very honest little film that deserves the attention of a wide audience eager to understand the varying motivations of other people . Grady Harp
Another Wedding Movie - with a Zing !	THE BEST MAN doesn't try to invent a new concept in comedy , it doesn't attempt to be a ' great movie ' , it simply entertains on every level as another look at the interpersonal challenges that happen in the heightened atmosphere of a wedding . This time around the cast is African American and for once this is not a Blacksploitational film . Yes there are plenty of in jokes and idiosyncrasies that perhaps not everyone in the audience will ' get ' , but the story works well and the cast is one of the best collected on film . Four very handsome men - Taye Diggs , Morris Chestnut , Harold Perrineau , and Terrence Howard - are the male side of wedding party , the very beautiful women being Nia Long , Sanaa Lathan , Monica Calhoun and Melissa De Sousa - and these beautiful actors immerse themselves in a story with many twists and lessons and appear to be having the time of their lives doing it . Taye Diggs has the lead and continues to show his growth as an actor . But it is the pleasure of seeing the now famous Terrence Howard in one of his many early roles that makes the film truly worthwhile . Not a great movie , but a film of sound production and some of the most appealing actors around ! Grady Harp , January 06
' All the world's a stage , and all the men and women merely players '	It is refreshing to rest assured that Shakespeare remains a viable writer and no matter how his plays are manipulated or ' updated ' or altered or interpreted , his majesty of the English language remains intact and the impact of his ideas and words sustain even the most bizarre reconsiderations . Such , for this viewer , is the case of MACBETH as condensed for the screen by writer / actress Victoria Hill and directed with intensity and sensitivity of communication by Geoffrey Wright . The result may seem to be a bloody mad feud suggesting a majority of the teen driven films of today , but consider the source : imagining Shakespeare's MACBETH without the gore would mean the meat had been removed . Transferred from Scotland to Melbourne , Australia , the well-known fight for kingship among the Scots is transposed to be the turf struggle for supremacy in the underworld gangland of Melbourne . The script and the direction make this transposition work , using the original dialog from the play , placing it in the voices and bodies of an all-Australian cast , to the point that the allegiance of the actors as to place is far less important than the telling of a powerful tale of ambition . Sam Worthington makes an enigmatic yet strong Macbeth , well paired by Victoria Hill as his conniving and ultimately mad wife Lady Macbeth : the two form a chemistry that serves the original intent of the author well . The many characters who rise and fall in the wake of the ambition of Macbeth tend to blend a bit because of the condensation of the script , but Gary Sweet as the doomed Duncan , Steve Batoni as Banquo , and Lachy Hulme as Macduff are particularly fine . The three witches whose predictions drive the play here become nude seductresses and are well interpreted by Miranda Nation , Chloe Armstrong , and Kate Bell . The battle scenes are appropriately gruesome and the musical score that accompanies this film is an odd mixture of rock and piano transcriptions of Beethoven symphony movements . With the bracing cinematography by Will Gibson it all works well . Unfortunately the Shakespearean language can become lost with the heavy Aussie accents and subtitles would have been helpful . But if your television set has that subtitle option available , this small defect can be overcome . Yes , it helps to know the original play well in order to fully appreciate the transposition , but the script and cast and director make a fine case for involving even the uninitiated into the power of MACBETH . Worth your time , this . Grady Harp
Chabrol's Newest Intrigue Puzzle , but One with Missing Pieces	The films of French Cinema master Claude Chabrol have been some of the quirkier , intelligent , strange , and creative works to come out of France ( La Fleur du mal , Merci pour le chocolat , Au coeur du mensonge , Rien ne va plus , La Cérémonie , L'Enfer , Madame Bovary , Dr . M , etc ) . His works are marked with sinister underpinnings and his technique has been to place his characters in situations that challenge them to behaviors they consider bizarre until they understand the core of their somewhat deranged personalities . LA DEMOISELLE D'HONNEUR ( THE BRIDESMAID ) succeeds as a art work on so many levels that the viewer is inclined to forgive some of the dangling missing pieces in character and plot development that prevent this film from being Chabrol's finest . The setting , pacing , cast and concept are intriguingly seductive : that is enough to make the film work well . The Tardieu family is in the midst of preparing for the wedding of one daughter Sophie ( Solène Bouton ) , learning to accept the new love affair of the mother Christine ( Aurore Clément ) to a wealthy newly divorced man Gérard ( Bernard Le Coq ) , becoming used to the edgy antisocial behavior of daughter Patricia ( Anna Mihalcea ) , and all the while being cared for by the successful contractor son Philippe ( Benoît Magimel ) . On the television is the report of a murdered young woman and the disruption of a television show frustrates the obsessive Philippe in his work to keep the family focused . We jump to Sophie's wedding to nerdy Jacky ( Eric Seigne ) whose cousin Stéphanie " Senta " Bellange ( Laura Smet ) is the bridesmaid of the title . The strange but sensuous Senta captures Philippe's eye and a rather torrid love affair begins . Senta is passionate and makes Philippe agree to four demands to prove he loves her : the last two ( killing someone / anyone ) and having sex with a same sex partner ) jolt Philippe but he throws his usual caution to the wind and proceeds with the pairing . A homeless man who lives at Senta's grimy cellar lodging door repulses her , and when a police report that the man has been found dead , Philippe falsely ' confides ' to Senta that he is responsible . Senta then promises to kill Gérard as her half of the bargain : Gérard has avoided Philippe's mother and Philippe feels animosity toward anyone who would disturb his beloved mother . The plot thickens , then boils : the ' murders ' change from reality to mistaken identity to heinous ends . Philippe has become immersed in Senta's madness , leaving an ending that remains ' in media res ' . Chabrol leaves strange clues scattered about for the astute eye to discover , at times in retrospect , and it is this trait that makes the story so fascinating . The cast is superb , with Benoît Magimel proving that his success in ' The Pianist ' was not a fluke . He is a gifted actor and maintains an electrifying screen presence . This may not be Chabrol's best film , but it is twisted enough to keep the viewer tensely focused on the very strange story and on the complexly interesting set of characters in this very French film noir !

And if you like James Ellroy . . .	Despite the fact that we are seeing a plethora of ' bad cop ' movies , it is hard not to like STREET KINGS by the premiere writer of this genre , James Ellroy . This film is not unique in subject matter , but the pace of the action , the keen directing by David Ayer , and the cast of important and popular actors makes this film well worth watching . Tom Ludlow ( Keanu Reeves ) is a damaged person after his wife's ' unsavory death ' and he is the take-no-prisoners type of cop who goes after the tough gangsters and offs them rather than arresting them . His boss is Captain Wander ( Forest Whitaker ) whose unit is filled with corrupt cops ( Jay Mohr , John Corbett , Amaury Nolasco , Chris Evans etc ) . There is brutal activity surrounding a personal feud between Ludlow and Washington ( Terry Crews ) and during a convenience store holdup , Washington is killed in Ludlow's presence . Internal Affairs Captain Biggs ( Hugh Laurie ) is out to pin the incident on Ludlow , but what happens as the death of Washington is investigated throws light on the depth of corruption within the police force . The manner in which each of the corrupt cops is taken out serves as the rapid - fire conclusion of the film . This is a dark film and were it not of Ellroy's storytelling gifts it could seem banal . But Reeves and Whitaker give excellent performances and draw the audience into this putrid vat of cop corruption despite the urge not to watch the deeds . A good action , heavily noir film .

Dance 10 , Story 4	STOMP THE YARD comes as a pleasant surprise to those of us who have yet to be introduced to ' stepping ' - a sport / dance form that is not break dancing , not hip-hop , not modern dance , not clogging , not ballet , but instead is an exhilarating display of rhythm , physical dexterity , and creative choreography that makes this little film well worth watching . The story is minimal and hackneyed and serves basically as an outline for the dance performances . DJ ( the enormously talented dancer / actor Columbus Short ) is sent from Los Angeles to Atlanta's Truth University after his conviction for street brawling , a fight in which his brother ( Chris Brown ) was killed . Once on campus DJ is works for his uncle as a gardener and is soon courted for his step dance skills by two rival fraternities . One fraternity gains DJ's attention and he pledges . Of course there is the requisite love conflict ( the beautiful Meagan Good as April ) , who just happens to be the girlfriend of the rival fraternity step leader ( Darrin Henson ) , and the usual undercurrent of familial dichotomies between DJ's humble background and April's influential father bring the tension to the front : the result is DJ's triumphant performance in the annual stepping competition between the two fraternities . The ending is predictable but sensitive and with a message . The real star of the film is the magnificently choreographed and executed dancing , performed by the actual cast members . Director Sylvain White and his choreographers center their attention on the big sequences and the result is very fine entertainment . In addition to the gifted Columbus Short and Darrin Henson the cast includes such fine actor / dancers as Brian J . White , Ne-Yo , Laz Alonzo , Oliver Ryan Best , Richmond Duain Martyn , Justin Hires , and many others . It is difficult to resist the excitement of the commitment of this fine cast to the introduction of step dancing to the public at large . So much talent ! Grady Harp
Wondrously Strange Film	VILLA DES ROSES , based on the novel by Willem Elsschot , is a strange and claustrophobic examination of life in a confined space in Paris 1912-1913 . Director Frank Van Passel has surrounded his production with excellent scenery , effects , camera work and a cast of gifted actors to tell this bizarre tale of Europe on the brink of The Great War . Villa des Roses is a dilapidated mansion in Paris that serves as a hotel for an astonishingly seedy group of people . The hotel is ' managed ' by a British man and wife Olive ( Harriet Walter ) and Hugh ( Timothy West ) who barely eek out a living from their irregular tenants . The one person apparently most in the know is Ella ( Shirley Henderson ) who is the Cook General and has access to all of the nooks and crannies via a spying system of tubes : she knows all the secrets of all of those housed in the Villa . It is an odd asylum for the British and for varied oddball , lost souls and disillusioned , loony guests in the midst of a rundown Paris . Enter Louise Créteur ( Julie Delphy ) , recently widowed by the Titanic sinking , who has left her young son behind to seek work in Paris . She gains employment at the Villa des Roses as the Chamber Maid , under strict instruction by Olive to not fraternize with the guests . But one of the tenants , Richard Grünewald ( Shaun Dingwall ) is a lady's man and soon the two have started a love affair that leads to the tragic end of the story . Richard loathes children , is not at all happy that Louise has a son ( though she vows to give up everything for her love for Richard ) , and when Louise becomes pregnant , Richard cools and encourages an abortion . Louise complies out of blind love only to return to the Villa to find that Richard must leave for Germany ( when actually he is following the latest American guest in her transfer to a better hotel ) . Louise's only confidant and friend is Ella and together they survive . Louise decides to go to Germany to ' find Richard ' and on her way to the train sees Richard with his American paramour . Richard is called to military service at the same time Louise is boarding the train , a moment that proves to be the outbreak of WW I . How the story ends is tender and sad and best left as a surprise to the viewer . Van Passel seems more interested in atmosphere of this magically strange hotel than he is in fleshing out his storyline . Oh , each of the characters is vastly interesting , but there is no background history on any of them that let us know why they had fallen into the sad mess of the Villa . But the performances by Julie Delphy , Shirley Henderson , and Shaun Dingwall are so fine that they maintain our attention and empathy . The strong supporting cast does as much as it can with the relatively little character development given them . The entire film is photographed in sepia tones that add enormously to the feeling of France on the brink of downfall . This is a long film , highly dependent on visual imagery to keep it flowing , but a film with many messages about the world at the brink of war . Recommended . Grady Harp
What price glory ?	COMME UNE IMAGE ( LOOK AT ME ) is a tough little film that practically defies the viewer to love it . Rated as a comedy , it has few chuckles of the usual kind , but the smart tidy script delivers more of the Reformation-type comedy - wit with a bite . Writer / director and star Agnès Jaoui ( her co-author is her ex-husband Jean-Pierre Bacri who also stars ) is obviously an intelligent , observant , caustic chronicler of contemporary French society who dotes on celebrities at the expense of their own self-respect . Not a single character in this film is likable , but each one is fascinatingly interesting and a bit warped . Their interaction provides the venom that in Jaoui's hands raises the bar on the range of comedy . Étienne Cassard ( Jean-Pierre Bacri ) is a famous writer whose latest novel has been ' transformed ' into a schmaltzy film about which he is loathsomely embarrassed . He is caustic , acerbic , and emotionally negligent of both his grown obese daughter Lolita ( Marilou Berry ) , who devotes her resentful life in an attempt to being a famous concert singer , and to his new wife Karine ( Virginie Desarnauts ) and little daughter . Lolita's music coach is Sylvia ( Agnès Jaoui ) whose demands on her students reflect her frustrated life being married to an unknown author Pierre ( Laurent Grévill ) . Odd paths cross and it is through Lolita's influence as the daughter of a famous writer Étienne that Sylvia arranges for Pierre to join forces with Étienne and gain acceptance and popularity , but the consequences include Sylvia's increased tutelage for Lolita and her group of fellow madrigal singers . Lolita comes the closest to being a character about whom we care . She is distraught about her weight , her distant father , her stepmother and stepsister , her inability to gain the affection for the boy of her dreams , her struggle to become a significant performer - all of which prevents her from recognizing the man who could salvage it all - Sébastien ( Keine Bouhiza ) who literally falls at her feet ! All of these characters interact in complex and at times trying ways , ever cognizant of the ' authority of celebrity ' and the results of these engagements form the body of the film . The acting is on a high level , the dialogue is crisp and smart , and the musical background for this mélange is a gorgeous mixture of classical music ranging from Buxtehude through Schubert ( ' An die Musik ' plays a big role ! ) and many others . This ' comedy ' is more intellectual than entertaining , but if wit and elegance of acting brings you joy , then this is a film to see . In French with subtitles at a long 2 hours ! Grady Harp
The Gory Glory of the Roman Empire	HBO takes risks , thank goodness , and this series ROME is a fine example of how far a television project can go toward the movie industry and still maintain interest when broken into weekly installments . There may be a number of quibbles from Latin scholars and historians as to the veracity of it all , but ROME is not a documentary : ROME is a novel played out in Grand Guignol fashion with a sterling cast and a creative production crew . The action takes place in 52 BC and allows us to understand the power struggles and changes of influence between Pompey Magnus ( Kenneth Cranham ) who leads the Senate , and Julius Caesar ( Ciaran Hinds ) . Caesar has returned from his Gallic wars supported by his soldiers such as Lucius Vorenus ( Kevin McKidd ) and his somewhat unfaithful wife Niobe ( Indira Varma ) and Lucius ' best friend ( and philosophically polar opposite ) Titus Pullo ( Ray Stevenson ) . But the populace and Senate have formed other ideas during Caesar's prolonged absence at war and all manner of intrigues surface , are planned , and are plotted . There is a generous ( some would say excessive ) amount of violence and sex spattered about , but then when in Rome . . . . Some of the supporting cast are particularly fine : Polly Walker is more beautiful ( and more evil ) than ever as Atia and other small roles are graciously filled with superb actors . The distractions from the series include the ever-present town crier who periodically catches us up on the history as a media newspaper person in toga . And the opening credits are animated graffiti that become silly and tiresome . But the overall production values are first class and the color of the cinematography is some of the finest seen on television . It is a long song , but it can be taken in digestible pieces . Well worth viewing for a different view of Rome in all its squalid splendor . Grady Harp
An Excellent Examination of the Darkness of Madness	Kai S . Peck is one courageous Director ! He has created a very substantial and quite disturbing film about an actual bizarre serial killer and through the statements and letters of his subject and a book by Paul Moor and his astute directing he has been able to step over the sensationalism of his subject and open the door into the mind of a very ill person . THE CHILD I NEVER WAS ( originally titled EIN LEBEN LANG KURZE HOSEN TRAGEN ) is frighteningly based on fact . From 1962 through 1966 a fifteen-year-old boy named Jurgen Bartsch tortured , murdered , and then sexually molested four young German boys . This infamous serial killer is first introduced in a black and white sequence of Jurgen as a 20 year old ( Tobias Schenke ) in prison for his crimes . He frankly talks about his crimes , acknowledging their evil , but at the same time seeks to uncover his own motivations for having performed such deeds . Through a series of flashbacks we see Jurgen as a child and as a 15 year old ( Sebastian Urgendowsky ) and discover he was adopted by a couple who are bipolar parents - Gertrud ( Ulrike Bliefert ) and Gerhard ( Walter Gontermann ) Bartsch . Their parenting is brutally bounced from feigned kindness to flailing mistreatments . They do not allow Jurgen to have friends , to socialize , to have any interests . When Jurgen begins to get in touch with his sexuality , they foster care him and seek professional advice for his sickness of homosexuality . Young Jurgen is unable to relate to anyone and he yearns for friends . He discovers a cave where he can escape form his ugly world and fantasize about many things , including sexual fantasies about boys ' ages 8 through 14 ' . Gradually he gives in to his compulsion to seduce boys into his cave where he tortures them , eviscerates them , and once they are dead he has sexual acting out with them . At one point he seeks a priest's ( Jürgen Christoph Kamcke ) confession booth seeking absolution , but the priest only tells him that he must confess to the police and devote his life to charity . Eventually during his fourth episode of his serial madness he leaves his victim bound , disturbed that this boy actually seems to return Jurgen's bizarre sexual advances , and when he returns to the cave the boy has escaped . Jurgen is captured and imprisoned . The way in which the film resolves is actually touching in that from surprise confessions we grow to understand these serial murders on a certain level . To reveal these facts would hamper the suspense of the film . Suffice it to say that here is a sophisticated film unafraid to enter the darkest regions of a young man's mind and in doing so heightens our awareness of the fine line between response to personal abuse and madness . The cast is extraordinarily fine . Grady Harp
Needs and Recriminations	PUNISH ME ( VERFOLGT ) , aptly photographed in rich black and white , is a deftly made German film that raises as many questions as disturbing thoughts , a film that in every definition is a film noir - and a superb one at that . Writer Susanne Billig and director Angelina Maccarone ( note : two very talented women ! ) have concocted a tale of disparate matching between a 50-year-old woman and a 16-year-old boy , a relationship that builds on sadomasochism as a means of filling voids in each character . The story could easily have become ' sensational ' in less sensitive hands , but here , with the sound help of a superb and wholly credible cast , it asks us to examine the extremes to which people will go to feel complete . Jan Winkler ( the gifted and inordinately handsome Kostja Ullmann ) is 16 and on probation for petty crimes . He is assigned to parole officer Elsa Seifert ( the fine actress Maren Kroymann ) , a 50-year-old frustrated woman in a marriage that has stagnated . Jan feels a strange attraction to Elsa , an act that at first Elsa rebuffs and discourages but gradually becomes fascinated with the attention and seductive behavior of the young Jan . Committed to helping Jan she manages to talk her husband into employing Jan at his car repair shop the two males strike up a friendship . In a series of subtle episodes Jan suggests his need for ' structuring ' to Elsa : what he needs is Elsa to punish him physically , and when Elsa complies she is attracted to the process of sadomasochistic behavior ( as the Dominatrix ) as well as to the tenderness that always follows their dark sessions . Elsa's husband discovers his wife's relationship with Jan while Jan's friends uncover the secret , and the resulting behavior and recriminations flesh out the surprising ending . Both Ullmann and Kroymann are outstanding in these difficult roles and manage to maintain our empathy and understanding throughout the story . Both are exceptional actors and both have compelling screen presence . The cinematography allows us to once again remember how powerful black and white film can be . This is a film that some may find difficult to view ( sadomasochism , teenage / older woman ' romance ' ) , but the director keeps the story in tight rein and the result is a powerful tale of need and love and the sticky path that often joins the two feelings . In German with English subtitles . Recommended . Grady Harp
Christmas and a time for meting out miracles	NOEL is an unabashedly romantic little film , the type of movie Hollywood used to make for Christmas seasons before the toilet mouth Bad Santa , etc type became popular . Perhaps the time has returned for us to examine how the world can come together at this time of year , sort of a good omen that we just might all start taking care of each other again ! Chazz Palminteri takes on directing this story by David Hubbard , surrounds himself with a top notch crew of actors , and capably and sensitively brings off this little story of the interweaving of five lives on a Christmas Eve in New York City with all the tenderness and associated joy of placing old and loved garlands and bangles on a tree . It is a perfect film for re-discovering the meaning of Christmas . Christmas Eve in Manhattan finds various characters who are in turmoil at this special time of the year . Successful book publisher Rose Harrison ( Susan Sarandon ) fights off depression by being kind to everyone : her lonely life is centered on spending her non-work hours tending to her mother who has advanced Alzheimer's Disease ( she is divorced without children and without love ) . Across the hall from her mother's hospital room is a comatose man who never has visitors , and when Rose brings him an angel ornament for is window she meets Charlie ( Robin Williams ) who apparently has been visiting . Elsewhere in the city is Jules ( Marcus Thomas ) who informs strangers that his only good Christmas memory as an unwanted and abused kid was one he spent in a hospital after a beating : he plans to have his hands broken so that he can spend the night in the hospital where he hopes to discover joy . And then there is police officer Mike ( Paul Walker ) engaged to gorgeous Nina ( Penélope Cruz ) whom he inadvertently drives away with his jealous behavior . Mike is observed by old Artie ( Alan Arkin ) who recognizes Mike as the reincarnation of his deceased wife and longs to establish a close relationship with his newfound love . All of these disparate characters interact by coincidence : Rose mistakenly intrudes on Nina's family gathering only to end up in a café with Nina sharing her secret grief for which Rose offers empathy and lessons . Mike confronts the strange Artie who collapses and lands in the hospital where Mike senses his history and gently offers him empathy . Nina and Mike face a condition that alters their relationship , Rose discovers a secret about Charlie that allows her to learn about love and compassion and forgiveness , etc etc etc . These are little miracles , the kinds of everyday occurrences that our speed of life ignores . If it takes a film of this nature to help us gain awareness of the importance of personal peace , companionship , forgiveness and love , then hats off to Hubbard and Palminteri - and to a wonderful cast of fine actors enjoying their craft . Highly Recommended for everyone with a strong sentimental streak ! Grady Harp
' We all join the dance '	Paris , JE T'AIME is a wondrous cinematic homage to the city of light and the city of love , a film so complex that it almost defies summarization and reviewing . Ask a large group of people their impressions of life in Paris and the result would be something akin to this film . Tied together by each of the sectors or Arrondissement of the city , the film examines love in all forms , native folk in their Parisian modes , and tourists interacting with the great city . Approximately twenty writers and directors , each with about five minutes of screen time , include Olivier Assayas , the Coen Brothers , Sylvain Chomet , Isabel Coixet , Wes Craven , ALfonso Cuarón , Gérard Depardieu , Christopher Doyle , Vincenzo Natali , Alexander Payne , Walter Salles , Nobuhiro Suwa , and Gus Van Sant among others less well known . The stories vary from hilarious , to humorous , to touching , to tragic , to banal , to tender . In one story a young Frenchman ( Gaspard Ulliel ) is attracted to a young lithographer ( Elias McConnell ) , pouring out his heart in French to a lad who speaks only English . In another a separated husband and wife ( Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara ) meet in the Latin Quarter to finalize divorce proceedings while another couple in Père-Lachaise ( Emily Mortimer and Rufus Sewell ) approach marriage without connection until the spirit of departed Oscar Wilde intervenes . Steve Buscemi in Tuileries confronts superstition in a subway with his bag of tourist collections , in Bastille Sergio Castellitto ( in love with mistress Leonor Watling ) is ready to divorce his wife Miranda Richardson until she confides she has terminal leukemia , Juliette Binouche confronts agony about her son's fantasies and loss in Place des Victoires with the help of a mythical cowboy Willem Defoe , Sara Martins and Nick Nolte and Ludivine Sagnier display a keen tale of mistaken ideas in Parc Monceau , Fanny Ardant and Bob Hoskins ' play out ' a strange relationship in Pigalle , Melchior Beslon plays a young blind man to actress Natalie Portman in learning how to see in Faubourg Saint-Denis , vampire love between Elijah Wood and Olga Kurylenko in Quartier de la Madeleine , Maggie Gyllenhaal is an ex-patriot actress stung out on drugs in Quartier des Enfants Rouges , and Margo Martindale is a visiting tourist letter carrier trying desperately to speak the French she has studied for her life's trip in a tenderly hilarious 14ème Arrondissement . The final few minutes of the film tries to tie together as many of the stories as feasible , but this only works on superficial levels . The film is long and there are no bridges between the many stories , a factor that can tire the audience due to lack of time to assimilate all of the action . But it is in the end a richly detailed homage to a great city and supplies the viewer with many vignettes to re-visit like a scrapbook of a time in Paris . It is a film worth seeing multiple times !

A Wonderfully Heartwarming Story : An Excellent Film !	WONDROUS OBLIVION may seem a puzzling title for this film about racism , coming of age , and understanding and acceptance , but if it is meant to tag the feelings with which the viewer is left after the film , the phrase describes it well . Some critics have labeled this a cross between BILLY ELLIOTT and FAR FROM HEAVEN and while that comparison may be a bit too heavy , the films share many things in common . Writer / director Paul Morrison has stirred the pot of nostalgia with all the right ingredients the result is a film that should bring a very large audience to its feet . The time is the 1960s in London in a neighborhood shared by Jews and other faiths . One family in particular , the Wisemans , live comfortably as German immigrants whose elder family members died in Nazi Germany . David Wiseman ( Sam Smith ) is eleven years old , and preoccupied with cricket , a sport for which he collects souvenir cards and idolizes players yet who has no skills at playing the game , but stays with his passion with the school team as a score keeper . His father Victor ( Stanley Townsend ) is all business , and his mother Ruth ( Emily Woof ) is a kind woman who seems to need more attention than her husband offers . Into the house next door moves a family from Jamaica - Dennis ( Delroy Lindo ) , his wife and two daughters are happy people and play Jamaican music while they construct an odd entity in the tiny back yard , a construction that ends up being a cricket court as Dennis and his daughter are devoted cricket players . In no time the shy David introduces himself and shortly becomes invited to join in learning how to play cricket with the warmly loving Dennis and family . David learns the game well enough to become part of the school playing team and with his increased popularity he is honored with a birthday party , a party to which his new friend form cricket lessons next door is not invited . Hurt , she refuses to play with David any more and that fact unveils a series of events that have been in existence progressively since the black family moved into the white neighborhood . David's mother is warmly noticed by Dennis and the two come very close to a love relationship . Finally a tragedy occurs that brings out all of the needs and the prejudices , the feelings and the commitments that serve to change the way each of the families in the now mixed neighborhood view each other . The tragedy becomes a blessing in disguise . The flavor of the 1960s , the importance of familial Judaism , the joy of the Jamaican view of life and the bigotry that can decimate good people are all captured with great finesse by Morrison . The large cast is excellent with Sam Smith and Delroy Lindo giving particularly fine performances . This is a film that will warm the heart , teach us more about things we little understand , and leave us with the hope that Morrison will make more films of this high caliber . Highly recommended .

A Heartwarming Journey Into Retired Living !	SCHULTZE GETS THE BLUES is one of the more poetic films about aging and the choices people make at points of life-change as any to date . The utter simplicity of technique that writer / director Michael Schorr uses to tell this quiet tale of the glory of the human spirit is magical . This is one of those films that deserves a very wide audience from every age group ! Schultze ( Horst Krause ) , Jürgen ( Harald Warmbrunn ) and Manfred ( Karl Fred Müller ) have just been retired from their life's occupation of working the salt mines in a bleak little German town , and are left to ' celebrate ' ( with their company ' trophy lamps ' made of large illuminated salt crystals ! ) , drink beer , and ponder their next step : retired life . Of the three , Schultze is the loner , his wife in an extended care facility for the mentally challenged where Schultze plays his accordion polkas for their entertainment . The woman in charge Frau Lorant ( Rosemarie Deibel ) encourages Schultze to further his interest in his accordion . Manfred and Jürgen insist he play polka music and enter a contest in America . But Schultze has heard zydeco music on the radio ( zydeco = a style of dance music originating in Louisiana that is usually played on accordion , guitar , and violin and combines traditional French melodies with Caribbean and blues influences ) and becomes quietly obsessed with that music . Off to America to compete in a Texan Polka Contest , loner Schultze wanders to Louisiana where he finds not only the music of his soul but a people who accept him more than his little German hometown . And the gentle message of this quiet little film is about loneliness and friendship and the impact they make on us all . Schorr spends the bulk of this two-hour journey with visuals that depict isolation , longing , and the small things that make up what we call life . His cast is superb , with Horst Krause's Schultze creating one of the most memorable characters on film . In a time when Baby Boomers are looking at retirement with anxiety , this little movie is just the antidote . Highly Recommended ! Grady Harp , October 05
Memories before Dying : Reflections on Friendship and Survival	Zhivko Chingo wrote a children's book in the 1970s , a Yugoslavian best seller , ' Golemata voda ' ( ' The Great Water ' ) about the way the children of Macedonia responded to the critical changes Communism created in the country in 1945 . It is stunningly brought to the screen by Ivo Trajkov as a labor of love and dedication and as an attempt to pay homage to the philosophical sensibilities of the Macedonian people in a difficult time of transition . The film begins in the present as old Lem ( Meto Jovanovski ) is experiencing a heart attack and while he is being wheeled into a hospital and examined and wired , he has memory flashbacks to his childhood in 1945 when the WW II was over , Stalin was in power , and orphans were placed in ' orphanages ' ( re-education facilities ) to learn the Communist life . Young Lem ( Saso Kekenovski ) was brought to the ' orphanage ' when his parents were imprisoned for their anti-Stalin stance , and since he is new to the system , he must quickly adjust to the Dickens-like poor house conditions . He is befriended by his ' instructors ' Ariton ( Mitko Aposolovski ) and Olivera ( Verica Nedeska ) , learning how to adjust to the role of obedient brainwashing . The most influential person in Lem's life arrives in the form of young Isak ( Maja Stankovska ) whose girlfriend has been in the camp prior to Isak's arrival . The manner in which Lem struggles to repay Isak's kindnesses is by acting as a liaison with camp commander to find Isak's love . It is this friendship's course that serves as the tender core of this film . The struggles quietly underplaying all of the camp surface activity are many : the dichotomy of a Communist ideology removing the Church from existence with a people dependent upon the spiritual values of religion , the Stalin / Tito issue , the adjustments to the policies of Communist regime in a country where fierce national pride had ruled , and the depersonalization of children into political pawns despite the need for role models and the luxury of growing up with friends and confidants . But it is the powerful effect of retrospect as the old Lem relives this tragic time that fills this film with luminous meaning . This is one of the few films that has been made in Macedonia ( a former portion of Yugoslavia now the Republic of Macedonia ) and it is a genuinely touching , finely tuned work of art , one that depends on a large cast of non-professional child actors gathered from the Macedonian schools by Ivo Trajkov . The DVD is accompanied by a statement by Trajkov not only about the film but also about the pride of Macedonians that is enlightening and tender . Highly Recommended . Grady Harp
The Survival of the Individual Under the Cloud of Totalitarianism	Das Leben der Anderen ( The Live of Others ) is a powerful film that opens a window to the West of what life was like in East Germany during the time of the Berlin Wall . It is a tense yet balanced work by newcomer writer and director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck who manages to present a tense story of espionage , suspense , intrigue , and political danger without the need for car chases , explosions , gunfire , or any of the usual accoutrements that pulse through other stories of this nature . Instead von Donnersmarck shows us the interior lives of his characters , both those working with the East German government and Secret Police and those who struggled to survive individuality . One of the primary jobs of the Secret Police ( Stasi ) was to spy on informers and those who would leak information about East Germany to the West . One fact that was kept under lock and key was the high rate of suicide , especially among artists who could not bear the crushing eye of the Eastern police , that would be devastating information if leaked into the press of the West : this forms the nidus for the story of this film . It is 1984 and one agent - Captain Gerd Wiesler ( Ulrich Mühe ) is assigned the duty of spying on popular playwright Georg Dreyman ( Sebastian Koch ) and his live-in girlfriend , brilliant actress Christa-Maria Sieland ( Martina Gedeck ) . Dreyman is a friend of blacklisted director Albert Jerska ( Volkmar Kleinert ) and when Jerska commits suicide Dreyman feels compelled to get in the information to the West into a popular magazine in hopes that action will be taken . Wiesler alters his spying routine when he discovers that the Stasi official to whom he reports has different designs on Georg and Christ-Maria and his spirit shifts subtly in support of the artists . It is this inner struggle within Wiesler that alters the manner in which his spying information is reported and Wiesler's courageous deeds alter the Secret Police plans to destroy the artists ' venture . The manner in which Weisler interplays with the Stasi and covers for the artists is a towering example of the dignity of the individual human soul threatened by the worst of circumstances . The results of Weisler's decisions alter with the fall of the Wall in 1989 in a deeply touching yet very subtle way . The technical aspects of this film - cinematography , pacing , lighting , editing , and the splendid musical scored my Gabriel Yared - are as fine as any film created by seasoned directors . The manner in which von Donnersmarck keeps every actor focused on the inner personality , as much by body language and silences as well as by dialogue , is astonishingly fine . This is a fascinating story , told with elegant understatement and most worthy of the Oscar for Best Foreign Film . Highly Recommended . Grady Harp
Almodóvar's Women : The Powerful Mystique , the Grounded Source of Humanity	Pedro Almodóvar is this viewer's favorite film creator . His ability to wrangle humor , pathos , core feelings , endlessly fascinating characters , color , design , musical montage - all the elements of one who is in charge of every aspect of the final product - is matchless . He has evolved from the wonderfully madcap early films that continue to appeal today to the profoundly moving , human , verismo touched with surrealism stories that now grace the screens . VOLVER is a crown jewel in his growing flock of cinematic achievements . Almodóvar both wrote and directed this story about women , a tale that embraces his obvious profound admiration for the Feminine while fleshing out a group of characters about whom we care deeply . It is a moment in the lives of several women whose pasts have been in some way abused by men . Raimunda ( and extraordinary Penélope Cruz ) is a working mother whose husband Pedro ( Antonio de la Torre ) is an unemployed slob , a worthless man whose misbehaviors include attempted molestation of Paula ( Yohana Cobo ) , the fourteen-year-old daughter , who accidentally kills Pedro in his attack . Raimunda takes the blame , hides the body in the freezer , and continues her life of work and caring for not only Paula , but her very elderly aunt Tía Paula ( Chus Lampreave ) who is apparently being cared for by neighbor Agustina ( Blanca Portillo ) - who has been diagnosed with incurable cancer - but who is actually cared for by the ' ghost ' of Raimunda's deceased mother Irene ( Carmen Maura ) . A friend of Raimunda's asks her to care for his restaurant while on a vacation , a potential burden Raimunda turns into a successful eatery venture for a crew filming a movie . Raimunda's sister Sole ( Lola Dueñas ) , a quiet hairdresser , discovers that the ' ghost ' Irene is her real mother who has been in hiding since her supposedly incendiary death , takes her in disguised as a Russian to help her beauty parlor business , and understands that Irene wanted to return to correct some sad moments in the past , lies that must be confessed if her daughters and granddaughter are to have meaningful lives . It is the magical way that each of these women interacts to share needs , buried secrets and pains and support each other that makes this multilayered film glow with an aura that only Almodóvar can create . To say more would break the spell for those who have not seen the film . Be assured that Almodóvar has not written a tragedy : his ever-present flamenco obsession ( here a song beautifully suing by Cruz ! ) his preoccupation with color , his flare for outrageous comedic scenes , his artistic camera angles , and his use of amazing graphics during the titles are intact and some of his best here . While the performances of Cruz , Maura , Dueñas , Portillo and Cobo are astonishingly fine , all of the ancillary characters are beautifully realized . The musical score by Alberto Iglesias and the cinematography by José Luis Alcaine are Oscar worthy also . But it is the depth of creativity frosting every aspect of this special film that once again prove that Pedro Almodóvar is one of cinematic arts ' significant geniuses . Bravo / Brava ! Grady Harp
The Blurring Line Between Reality and Fantasy	PAN'S LABYRINTH is a mystery cloaked in the garb of a fairy tale for adults . It is an examination of the cruelty of the Civil War in Spain as Franco assumed prominence and the extent to which some people would resist or escape : one of those means of escape just happens to be fantasy . Writer / Director Guillermo del Toro proves his potential as one of the more important experimental filmmakers with this haunting , mesmerizing tale of a young girl's ability to cope with the world into which she is plunged . Ofelia ( Ivana Baquero ) is the eleven year old daughter of Carmen ( Adriana Gil ) whom we first meet as the mother and daughter move to the deserted mill to live with Carmen's sadistic and brutal new husband , Falangist Capitán Vidal ( Sergi López ) . Carmen is pregnant with Vidal's child and upon her arrival she is ordered to bed attended by the housekeeper Mercedes ( Maribel Verdú ) . Ofelia is frightened by Vidal and his cruel world and by the deteriorating condition of her very pregnant mother and follows a strange insect that leads her to a secret opening into a labyrinth . Her curiosity and desperation to find a better place leads to her discovery of an entirely different world beneath the ground , a world run by the Faun ( Doug Jones ) who gives Ofelia three tasks that will assist her in making her world above ground a better place . Ofelia must choose between the ever increasing terror surrounding her new home with Vidal and his heinous behavior and overcome the fear of the grotesque but fascinating world of Pan's Labyrinth : the story ends with the manner in which a child must face the realities of the failure of the adult world and find successful solutions - whether those solutions be reality or fantasy . Guillermo del Toro has chosen a superb cast of actors , extraordinary visual effects technicians , cinematographer Guillermo Navarro and music composer Javier Navarrete to create this magical tale . The film becomes one of the finest examples of the use of fantasy in an historical setting . It is bound to become a classic . Grady Harp
An Extraordinary , Poignant Love Story : Love in a Time of War	' Un amour à taire ' ( A LOVE TO HIDE ) is one of the more satisfying films to be released in a long time . From the writing by Pascal Fontanille and Samantha Mazeras , the direction by Christian Faure and a cast of gifted actors immersed in their roles , this story of love's survival in Nazi occupied Paris in World War II has many permutations and secrets not addressed before . This is one of those films that should be widely distributed and marketed for the large audience it is meant to address and inform . Set in 1942 in occupied France , the Lavandier family - father Armand ( Michel Jonasz ) , mother Marcelle ( Charlotte de Turckheim ) , and son Jean ( the gifted and handsome actor Jérémie Renier from ' L'Enfant ' , etc . ) runs a laundry that successfully services all Parisians and even takes in the obligatory Nazi customers . Jean is the main helper and his father's idol : the other member of the family is Jean's younger brother Jacques ( Nicolas Gob , an actor of ruggedly handsome good looks and talent ) who is imprisoned for a year for trafficking stolen goods from the homes of Jewish families sent to the camps . As the film opens we see young Sarah Morgenstern ( Louise Monot ) emerge from hiding in a house confinement that resulted in the Nazi slaughter of her family . Terrified , she seeks refuge with Jean , an old friend and flame from their childhood , as she has nowhere else to hide . Jean takes her in , gives her a job in the laundry , and arranges for her to live with Jean's lover of four years Philippe ( Bruno Todeschini , the fine and handsome actor remembered for his role in ' Son frère ' ) . Jean and Philippe understand the dangers of hiding a Jew : Philippe also understands the conflict of Jean's love for Sarah , platonic but real , and fears Sarah's injured feelings discovering Jean is gay . But the three become closely bonded . In times of war , crises occur too frequently : Jean is seen dancing with a Nazi officer in a local gay pub he is attending with Philippe ; Jacques is released from prison and falls in love with Sarah while continuing his underground life of criminal activity ; the Jews of Paris are rounded up and sent to concentration camps ( Sarah must pose as one ' Yvonne Brunner ' with papers supplied by Philippe to avoid discovery ) ; Jacques is thwarted by Sarah's continued love for Jean , rebuffing Jacques ' advances ; Jacques informs on Jean to prove to his parents that golden boy Jean is in fact gay ; Jean is arrested but the arrest turns to horror when his sexuality is discovered and he is beaten and sent to jails and eventually the concentration camp in Dachau , brandished with the pink triangle forced upon gays the way the yellow star was forced upon Jews to segregate them and mark them for extermination . The manner in which each of the family members deals with Jean's crisis forms the dénouement of the film : Philippe is exterminated , Sarah and Jacques marry and have a son named Jean , and the parents alter their views of the idiosyncrasies of their children when Jean is released at the end of the war a lobotomized zombie . The ending is breathless and difficult to watch . Films such as this could stumble on the clods of poor taste or sensationalism , but this film avoids all that and instead brandishes a script that is intelligent , powerful , understated , and immensely moving . The cast is absolutely brilliant and the production fully realizes the look , the sound , and the feeling of Paris under Nazi occupation . This is one of the more moving films this viewer has ever seen : it will be added to the personal library for sure . Grady Harp
Finding the True Dignity of the Samurai Legends	Tasogare Seibei ( ' Twilight Samurai ' ) is one of the most tender love stories committed to film . The past decade or so has found the beauty of Japanese martial arts gracing our screens in gorgeous epics of color , startling sword fighting , and wondrously beautiful costumes and recreations of Edo period stories and those more ancient , and while the audience for these epics never seems to dwindle , the use of the purity of the original works has dissipated into a glut of tacky movies to feed the mass mind . Martial Arts has become a Hollywood movie star . ' Twilight Samurai ' changes all that : the original use of martial arts as a part of the Samurai legend is of only minor importance here . This is a story of humanity and dignity put to the test and the results that inner beauty brings to the philosophy of the original Samurai codes . Seibei Iguchi ( Hiroyuki Sanada , in a stunning performance ) is recovering from the loss of the consumption death of his wife and lives with his beloved daughters Kayana ( Miki Ito ) and Ito ( Erina Hashiguchi ) and his senile mother ( Reiko Kusamura ) . He is debt ridden because of the costs of a proper funeral and works hard to make ends meet . He takes on odd jobs ( making insect cages , etc ) and works so hard that he neglects himself - personal hygiene , dress , and inability to fraternize with his friends . But Seibei is content to enjoy the love of his family - until the beautiful Tomeo ( Rie Miyazawa ) , his old childhood sweetheart , enters the picture , having just divorced her drunken abusive husband . Seibei longs to be with her but obeys the social laws of the times and Tomeo is ultimately betrothed to another . Seibei may be a Samurai but he is a peaceful one who sold his precious sword to pay some of his debts . He is now out of practice and can only fight with the ' short sword ' , a fact commensurate with his belief that killing is wrong . It is therefore against his moral fiber when , as political times begin to change and result in demands of suicide among the old order , that he is selected by his clan to murder a man who refuses to perform the requisite Harri Kari . At the promise from Tomeo that she will wait for his safe return from the dangerous mission , Seibei departs and encounters the wretched man appointed to him . How the tale resolves is for the viewer to discover . Everything about this film directed by Yoji Yamada who wrote the screenplay based on the novels by Shuuhei Fujisawa is understated not only by the actors but the entire crew , warmly photographed in earth tones , and gently tender . The only criticism is the atrociously awful musical score ( whining electronic keyboards sounding like very bad elevator Muzak ) written by Isao Tomita and Yousui Inoue . That is a minor flaw when all of the other fine attributes are considered . And aside from that this is a film that bears watching repeatedly - it satisfies that much . In Japanese with English subtitles . Grady Harp
Desire and the Spectrum of Human Attraction	Grande école seems to be one of those films that viewers either love passionately or dismiss as a mess . Robert Salis ( ' À la recherché du paradis perdu ' ) has not only adapted the play by Jean-Marie Besset for the screen , he is also the thoughtful , intelligent , and challenging director of this little masterwork . Though there is much to please the casual eye ( the cast is a collection of truly beautiful people ! ) with sensual scenes as brave as any yet filmed , the real beauty of Grande école is the multilayered story , a story which explores the dichotomies of class , race , gender , philosophy , economic status , and history and social issues - just the sort of milieu expected from a ' big school ' environment . A spectacular opening sequence reveals a castle-like private college in Paris complete with extended pyrotechnic displays of aerial fireworks , a fine metaphor for the personal explosions that will accompany the students in the school year in this college of the prosperous and one heavily weighted toward capitalistic ideals of perpetuating wealth . Paul ( Gregori Baquet ) is at the onset an oddity : he is he son of a Marseilles contractor , a man who has created a home life of racism and classism , a father who haughtily sends his son to the elite school to learn marketing and management despite the fact that Paul is more inclined toward the artistic aspects of learning . Paul has a girlfriend Agnès ( the stunningly beautiful Alice Taglioni ) who is a liberal supporter of human rights and while she attends the neighboring liberal arts college , she cannot understand why Paul can't share a flat with her . Paul prefers to live in the dorm and his roommates are the passive Chouquet ( Arthur Jugnot ) and the pinnacle of materialism Louis-Arnault ( Jocelyn Quivrin ) , who not only is focused on his studies but also on his college water polo team and his girlfriend Emeline ( Elodie Navarre ) . Paul and Louis-Arnault bond and though Paul has a strongly vivid sexual relationship with Agnès , he finds himself attracted to Louis-Arnault . In a post-game shower room scene Paul sits on the bench viewing the team playfully soaping each other and his sense of sexual awakening is palpable . Paul steals Louis-Arnoult's boxers , lies on his bed and we are aware that he desires Louis-Arnault . During this opening of the school year the three roommates stroll the campus and encounter an argument among the workers : Mécir ( Salim Kechiouche ) , a young handsome Arab from the working class , is being berated and Paul jumps to his defense . The two make eye contact and a chemistry is created . Though neither of the two considers himself homosexual ( and there is a beautiful scene that describes that desire is desire whether hetero or homo sexual ) but gradually they drift into an erotic world of sexual discovery ( in some of the most artistically sensual filming ever created ! ) . Agnès senses Paul's sexual changes and convinced that his longings are for Louis-Arnault , she poses a wager on which one will have the desirable Louis-Arnault first . Changes and conflicts occur right and left ( mise-en-scenes lifted directly from the play ) and the bonding of each of the characters is dramatically altered - Paul , Agnès , Louis-Arnault , Emeline , and especially Mécir , who is the only character in the film who seems in touch with his inner person . It is about the social and sexual and class games people play and how these irrational subdivisions of our culture can lead to sad ends . The cast is not only physically beautiful ( and there is sufficient full frontal nudity to gain access to the complete actors ! ) but they respond to Robert Salis ' direction with fine ensemble acting . The interweaving of dream sequences and illusions that accompany the utterly grounded factual storyline enhance the film immeasurably . Emmanuel Soyer is responsible for the gorgeous cinematography and Éric Neveux for the original musical score , a score beautifully complemented by excerpts of the music of Bach , Brahms , Bizet , Donizetti , Puccini and Shostakovich . As an important and fascinating addition to the CD Director Salis presents an excellent ' making of ' segment including deleted scenes ( and why they were deleted ) , running commentary from all of the actors , and a discussion of Foucault's philosophy and the nebulous understanding of ' desire ' - a facet of being an alive being . Highly recommended for those who long for challenging films of substance , films that imprint on the psyche for meditation long after the film is finished . Grady Harp
A Profoundly Disturbing Theme , A Wholly Successful Film !	THE WOODSMAN is the kind of film that took maximum courage to create on behalf of the entire crew - writer Steven Fechter ( who wrote the screenplay from his stage play ) , director Nicole Kassell , the producers , and of course the actors . So committed to this project that they also produced this wondrous film , Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick also have assumed the leading roles of this controversial drama and in doing so give us the finest performances of their distinguished careers . We , as society , play a major role in this story because it is very much about how we judge people , how we deal with those who have been incarcerated , and how we hold onto our intolerances for those who are out of the norm . Placing ourselves in the judgmental role makes the impact of this film that much more devastating . Walter ( Kevin Bacon ) has just been released from a 12-year prison term for molesting young girls and returns to his home to find a job in a lumberyard under the careful scrutiny of Bob ( David Alan Grier ) his boss . Mary-Kay ( Eve ) his co-worker tries to come on to him and is rebuffed by Walter , a man who lives in dark loneliness , filled with guilt and self-loathing , afraid to allow any sort of closeness with anyone . He rents an apartment across from a schoolyard ( ' the only landlord who would take my money ' ) where he observes from his window the source of his past ( and + / - present ) temptation - little girls at play . He also observes a young man approaching young boys , mirroring his own history of pedophilia , a view that will permanently alter his self-concept later in the film . Walter meets Vickie ( Kyra Sedgwick ) , finds it odd that a beautiful woman would be a laborer in a lumberyard of men , and after a time the two share a beer and end up in bed . Vickie eventually pries out Walter's reason for his incarceration , and while shocked she does not flee but instead shares her darkest secret that her three brothers molested her as a child . Noting Walter's developing relationship with Vickie , Mary-Kay finds the truth about Walter's past and makes it known to the entire lumberyard in the cruelest of ways . The injured Walter moves in with Vickie , continues seeing his therapist Rosen ( Michael Shannon ) , his brother in law Carlos ( Benjamin Bratt ) , and his parole officer Sgt Lucas ( Mos Def ) , and we slowly learn that Walter has a conflict with his sister with whom he napped as a child ' to smell her hair ' ( an act coupled with his history of pedophilia that makes his sister refuse to see him despite Carlos ' good attempt to re-join them ) . Along the way Walter encounters a 12-year-old girl Robin ( Hannah Pilkes ) who is also a loner and birdwatcher and we are allowed to see how Walter's recidivism surfaces as he longs for physical contact with Robin . Yet in a sensitive scene between the two , the spectrum of perpetrator and victim is played out solely through words : Walter invites Robin to sit on is lap only to discover that Robin's father has been showing the same behavior and what is communicated between the two is some of the most healing dialogue ever written . The manner in which this story ends is very much left up to the viewer ( remember we are part of the film ) to decide . The pacing of this tale , the minimal dialogue , the quiet of the gritty atmosphere - all of these contribute to the profound effect that is achieved in the brilliant performance by Kevin Bacon . Rarely has an actor captured the angst , the internalization , the bleakness of injured life after prison , and the longing for redemption that Bacon achieves with his face , his eyes , his body language and his manner of delivering his lines . Kyra Sedgwick is likewise extraordinarily powerful as the damaged woman who allows her rigid lonely life to embrace the likes of Walter . The supporting cast is uniformly outstanding , especially Hannah Pilkes as Robin , and Benjamin Bratt as Carlos . This may be the first film for Nicole Kassell but is surely won't be the last . She is a brilliant director who has mastered her resources and carved a treasure of a film . One can shout against the awards people for being so intimidated by the subject matter to prevent Kevin Bacon from being crowned for his penultimate achievement , but people forget who won the awards as soon as they are over : people can't forget the power of Bacon's performance . Highly Recommended .
A Really Fine Film That Shines Through the Melodrama	AKEELAH AND THE BEE is yet another take on the spelling bee theme ( Bee Season , Spellbound ) and on the concept of a gifted kid rising out of the difficulties of tough environs ( Finding Forrester , Good Will Hunting , Poetic Justice , Coach Carter , etc ) to find self-respect and the attendant happiness of achievement . Yes , it is predictable , heavy on emotional melodrama , tailored to tug at the heartstrings , etc . But because of the commitment of writer / director Doug Atchison and because of an amazingly solid cast it simply works . Hooray for positive films ! Akeelah Anderson ( Keke Parker in an impressive serious acting role ) lives in the Crenshaw area of Los Angeles with her nurse - who - wanted - to - be - a - doctor mother ( Angela Bassett ) and siblings with their own problems . Akeelah is a gifted speller but fears letting this fact be known for fear of ridicule by her peers . Her principal ( Curtis Armstrong ) catches wind of her gift , and encourages her to enter a spelling bee , an attempt to raise the standard of his failing school system . He engages his old school chum Dr . Larabee ( Laurence Fishburne ) , who has left his post of professor at UCLA , to be her coach . The relationship between these two damaged people forms the nidus for Akeelah to eventually become committed to preparing for the National Spelling Bee in Washington , DC , having won the local and divisional bees . Despite her mother's initial objections , Akeelah wanders out of her disastrous neighborhood into the Valley where she encounters the friendship of Javier ( J . R . Villarreal , another fine young actor ) and the two bond and commit to winning the bee . The road to the Final Spelling Bee competition is paved with numerous stumbling blocks , both between Akeelah and Dr . Larabee and among Akeelah and her family and friends , but eventually the big moment comes and Atchison has the good sense to create an ending that comes as a surprise , one that emphasizes all the right principals without selling out . Parker , Fishburne , Bassett and Villareal give solid performances . The DVD includes many featurettes that explain the history of the making of the film , the relationship between producers and director , and the touching relationship between Atchison and Parker . Does the film set any new precedents in cinema ? No , but it is a joy to see a well-crafted film avoid the obvious problems of telling a much-used story in such a convincing manner . It is a fine little film .
Sense and Sensuality : DH Lawrence's Masterpiece Glows in the Hands of the French !	DH Lawrence's novels may be tough to translate to the screen , so much of his writing is dependent on the words on the page as they form images of extraordinary beauty and sensuality . His novels are quintessentially British and reflect on the dehumanizing effects of modernity and industrialization , confronting issues relating to emotional health and vitality , spontaneity , sexuality , and human instinct . During his lifetime he was even labeled a pornographer , but that was then and now is now , and under the gifted guidance of director / writer ( with Roger Bohbot and Pierre Trividic ) Pascale Ferran , Lawrence's exquisite tale of sexual awakening has found what for this viewer is the finest transition of the novel to the screen . The place is England after WW I and Sir Clifford Chatterley ( Hippolyte Girardot ) is the paraplegic wealthy husband of Constance / Lady Chatterley ( a radiant Marina Hands ) . Quite apropos for the era , Constance tends to her impotent husband , does needlepoint , and takes walks to while away her boredom . On one of her walks she encounters the gamekeeper Parkin ( Jean-Louis Coullo'ch ) , seeing a partially nude man for the first time in her life . The impact awakens her somnolent sexuality and she manages to visit Parkin daily , gradually allowing her lust to unfold . Parkin is ' below her class ' but is a masculine , sensuous embodiment of everything Constance has never experienced . They slowly bond and both of them become passionately in love , finding lovemaking in Parkin's hut , in the woods , in the rain - wherever they encounter . Constance wants to have a baby and convinces Clifford that she can become impregnated and the resulting child would be ' Clifford's ' by pact . Constance travels to London , the Riviera , and other ports , only to return home believing that Parkin has reclaimed his ex-wife . But there are many surprises that greet her and the manner in which the story resolves ( in Ferran's hands ) leaves us unsure of the future . The film is captured amidst the beauties of the natural world - flowers , trees , springs , brooks - and these aspects of the natural world are an influential part of Constance's sexual awakening . Yes , there are scenes of complete nudity and love making but they are photographed so well by Julian Hirsch that they become an integral part of the story . The musical score by Béatrice Thiriet finds the right quality of elegance and sensuality . If there is a problem with this nearly three-hour film it is in the editing by Yann Dedet and Mathilde Muyard that takes liberties with scene transitions that prove disruptive . But it would be hard to imagine two actors who could match the subtlety and sexual tension that Marina Hands and Jean-Louis Coullo'ch to this film . It is breathtakingly beautiful to experience DH Lawrence's story in the hands of the French crew and cast . Grady Harp
Conrad , Chéreau , Huppert , Greggory : Exquisite Quartet for GABRIELL	Patrice Chéreau is one of the giants of entertainment , whether in his direction of operas ( his Wagner RING remains a gold standard ) , plays , or his films . He is a thoroughgoing artist , one who combines great intellect with a keen ear for music , camera movement , atmosphere , the spoken and unspoken word , and for accompanying some of the finest actors at work today in their realization of his visions . GABRIELLE is a case in point and for this viewer this is simply one of the strongest films to come out of France - a country much celebrated for its cinematic genius - in many years . Inspired by Joseph Conrad's short story ' The Return ' and adapted as a screenplay by Anne-Louise Trividic and Chéreau , the story is a brief history of a married couple whose ten-year marriage alters in one afternoon and evening - the time span of the film . Jean Hervey ( Pascal Greggory ) is a handsome man of wealth who ' acquired ' a wife Gabrielle ( Isabelle Huppert ) ten years ago . They live in a mausoleum of magnificent art and base their existence on the glamorous parties attended by the artists and patrons of the arts in turn of the century Paris . Jean's ' acquisition ' of Gabrielle included the understanding that they would have no intimacy : they do sleep in the same bedroom but in separate beds . Their marriage seems perfect - but it is hollow . Rather abruptly Gabrielle leaves a note on the dresser addressed to Jean , a note that states she has left him for a man : her need for sexual gratification has risen to the breaking point . Jean is devastated , but as he nurses his broken glass-injured hand Gabrielle returns : she could not go through with ending the marriage of convenience . The two have extended verbal exchanges and physical abuse but it is only to the servants that Gabrielle shares her true feelings . She decides to structure her marriage to Jean by submitting to him sexually , a status that is novel to their marriage , and it is this role reversal of the masculine / feminine state that sends Jean panicked into the night . Chéreau uses many techniques to render this story about intimacy ( or the lack thereof ) that strongly support the power of the film : sections are in black and white representing the way things appear and are structured to the planned observation ; Raina Kabaivanska plays and sings at a soirée ( she is an actual opera star ) ; Jean's staff of servants is only women instead of the usual mix of men and women ; the musical score by the brilliant Italian contemporary composer Fabio Vacchi is used as a ' character ' instead of background support ; and the camera work by cinematographer Eric Gautier uses a full cinemascope camera set up to add weight to the project . But none of these subtleties would have worked so perfectly without the brilliance of acting of Isabelle Huppert and Pascal Greggory . They find the core of these strange characters and allow us to understand the rather warped psyches of the pair . It is a feat of genius . As an added DVD feature there is an extended conversation with Chéreau , Huppert and Greggory about the film from the initial idea to the finished product and hearing these three brilliant artists share their insights is for once extremely additive to the film . This rather dark and brooding film may be a bit too static for some , but for lovers of cinematic art it is a complete triumph to experience . Grady Harp
A Grecian Threnody	THE WEEPING MEADOW ( ' Trilogia I : To Livadi pou dakryzei ' ) is writer / director Theodoros Angelopoulos ( with influences from Tonino Guerra plus assistance from Petros Markaris and Giorgio Silvagni ) creating a personal vision of the 20th century . The incredibly gifted Greek poet of a filmmaker mirrored the life and death of his own mother whose time on earth spanned a century and elected to capture the 100 years of sadness in a trilogy of films : The Weeping Meadow is Part I and details the years 1919 through 1949 . It is a masterwork . The film opens with what will be the trademark look of the movie - vistas of lonely people in a nearly monochromatic color space that uses water , both from rain and the collected results of rain . A group of refugees from Odessa have landed by a river in Thessaloniki where they must attempt to reconstruct their lives . Among them is a family - a wife and husband with their young son and a three-year-old orphan Eleni they have protected . The entire movie seems to be in slow motion , but that is just the studied , unhurried rhythm of Angelopoulos ' direction . As time passes we find that Eleni at a very early age has just given birth to twin boys while she has been sent away for the family's appearances : the father is the young son of the family . The story progresses through the World Wars , the civil wars , the influence of Hitler and Mussolini , the natural disasters of floods and disease , the social disparities of class , the rise of unions , the fall of democracy - all mirrored in the family that is trying to make the chaos of living in Greece resemble some sort of order . The young man is a musician and once he and Eleni have reunited with their twin boys , he decides he will go to America , the land of Promise for poverty stricken refugees , to work and make enough money to bring Eleni and the twins to America . But in his absence the progressive civil unrest and poverty the three endure in his absence results in the ultimate dissolution of the family . The story is less important than the moods evoked . The cinematography by Andreas Sinanos is a long gallery of miraculously composed , beautiful images : the cortège on the river , the flapping white sheets behind which we discover musicians , the constant vistas of the ocean and the river , the village and the battlegrounds burn themselves onto our visual fields and into memory . The gorgeous music that accompanies this symphonic work is by Eleni Karaindrou , mixing folksongs with wondrous symphonic moments . The cast is superb : they manage to create very specific people despite the fact that we rarely see them up close . But in the end this visual treasure is the extraordinary work of Theodoros Angelopoulos . If this is Part I of a Trilogy ( at almost three hours running time ) , we can only imagine the power that will follow in the Parts II and III . Experiencing THE WEEPING MEADOW takes patience and a long uninterrupted period of time ; the rewards are immeasurably fine . In Greek with English subtitles . Grady Harp
LA PROMESA : The Spanish Way with Gothic Thrillers	Some of the most intellectually terrifying films , stories that are imbued with religious symbolism , mysticism , and surrealism , are products of Spanish filmmakers and LA PROMESA is no exception . Writer / Director Héctor Carré finds just the right amount of credibility in the prelude to his psychological thriller to make the following strange events teeter on that thin line of delusion and reality . Gregoria ( the redoubtable Carmen Maura ) is a fragile woman , married to an abusive , unfaithful husband Roberto ( Juan Francisco Margallo ) and is confined to her house by order of her husband who taunts her for being barren . She is fanatically religious , obsessive compulsive , and walking closely to the abyss of insanity . Strange visions and incidents happen : in one instance she witness the fall of a house painter who despite a fracture of the skull tells Gregoria of his perfect little hometown in Galicia , a story that opens Gregoria's hopes for a better life . How she manages to depart her miserable life for Galicia involves an incident with her husband that for the sake of the viewers needs to remain occult . In Galicia she changes her name to Celia , saves a small boy Daniel ( Santiago Barón ) from an accident , and because of her courageous act observed by the boy's mother Dorita ( Ana Fernández ) she is invited to the palatial estate where she ultimately gains employment as a maid and nanny - with some reservations from the boy's father Leandro ( Evaristo Calvo ) who sees Celia's dark side . Celia and Daniel become devoted to each other and Daniel introduces Celia to the strange ' hauntings ' of the house and community and reveals the strained relationship of his parents . Also in the mansion Celia meets the cook Felisa ( Luisa Merelas ) and gardener Senén ( Julio Lago ) who watch Celia with suspicion . Daniel leads Celia to a mysterious church where Celia explains the saints , prays , and witnesses bizarre happenings . Always returning to this Gothic church for solace Celia begins observing problems in her new ' home ' and gradually her love for Daniel makes her mind bend around ridding the child of his parents , thus making Daniel her own child . Finally her sanity breaks and she is involved in murderous acts that are not what they appear to be . To say more would disrupt the story of how a deranged mind mixes delusions and actions to gain resolution to defaced dreams . As Gregoria / Celia , Carmen Maura again demonstrates the brilliance of her acting career . She makes us love this deranged , pitiful character while maintaining an atmosphere of madness and threat . The entire cast weaves in and out of this maze of reality / delusion and Director Carré manages to keep us confused about what we are watching in an extraordinary stance of the how the dysfunctional mind works . The settings are lovely , and the old church is terrifyingly beautiful with all lighting coming form tall tapers and votives and otherworldly light as captured by cinematographer Juan Carlos Gómez . The musical score by Suso Rey and Manuel Varela enhances the mood of the piece with compositions that could easily stand alone . This is not an easy film to watch , not because of violence ( though there is some ) , but because Carré never lets us know the exact truth of what we are watching : is this all in Celia's broken mind , is it real , is the story really happening , etc ? Highly recommended for lovers of Gothic tales . Grady Harp
An Engrossing , Brilliantly Played Work of Chamber Music	Woody Allen is always at his finest when he stays away from self-parody : the man can write and direct brilliantly and create solid gems of cultural / society examinations with the best of them ! MATCH POINT is a case in point . From the opening credits , to the keenly meaningful voice-over about the significance of luck in molding the course of our lives , to the arresting pause of a tennis ball frozen in its rise from a struck net before falling to either side , to the use of scratchy Enrico Caruso recordings - all of these are indications that Allen is about to lead us into a world defined by walking on razor blade edges . Match Point is an intelligent , burnished , glowing little masterpiece of movie making , a thriller that keeps the viewer bound until the surprise ending . Chris ( Jonathan Rhys Meyers , groomed and handsome and magnetic in his first role as a non-quirky oddball ) is a lower middle class ex tennis pro who begins his new life as a tennis teacher in a wealthy club where he encounters the Hewett family , a family of immense wealth lead by a benevolent father ( Brian Cox ) , a class conscious mother ( Penelope Wilton ) , a handsome son Tom ( Matthew Goode ) who is dating a middle class American wannabe actress Nola ( Scarlett Johansson ) , and daughter Chloe ( Emily Mortimer ) . Chris ' good looks and manners win the family's affection and he is melded into the fabric of wealth through his attention to Chloe and his movement into the father's business . Sadly for all Chris is attracted to the sensuous Nola who , despite her physical attraction for Chris , knows the steps to climb up the ladder to wealth by being engaged to Tom . Chris falls in love with his new life of luxury , marries Chloe who wants to have children immediately , and yet he lusts for Nola . In time Nola and Tom part ( the reason to be outlined later in the film ) and though hesitant to shake Chris ' marriage to Chloe , Nola becomes physically involved with Chris . The inherent dangers of Chris ' infidelity grow to tragic proportions and his knotty dilemma of choosing his new life of comfort versus his lust for Nola result in bits and pieces of luck that determine the outcome of the film . For this viewer it is difficult to fault any aspect of this film : the cinematography by Remi Adefarasin is not only stunning visually - it also captures the tension of the film in mixing tight shots with panoramas isolating the characters in motion of betrayal ; the film's music score is almost entirely opera excerpts from old Caruso recordings ( know the opera excerpts and the story is enhanced ! ) and from ' live ' stage performances at Covent Garden ( superb singing and staging oddly accompanied by only a piano ! ) . But the brilliance of this ensemble is Allen's keenly sensitive eye and timing and pacing of a suspense thriller that always has as its base a fine dollop of social comment and lusty romance . The cast is impeccable , from the consistently superb smaller roles to the tour de force acting of Jonathan Rhys Meyers , Scarlett Johansson , and Emily Mortimer . This is clearly one of the finest works of Woody Allen's long career and hopefully he will continue along this vein . Highly Recommended . Grady Harp
Revisiting Brideshead Offers New Insights into Waugh's Novel	BRIDESHEAD REVISITED is one of those epic films that travels the globe seeking adventure , finding glorious locations for telling a story , and offers a cast of outstanding actors to reexamine a tale known to most of us through not only the novel by Evelyn Waugh , but also by the very popular miniseries for television years back . For this viewer the experience offered by writers Andrew Davies and Jeremy Brock and as directed with such style by Julian Jarrold offers a far more interesting examination of the damages family can inflict upon children and does so with a story that flows with visual allure and consummate acting from a fine cast . The tale is well known : middle class young man enters the elegance of the wealthy class , encounters infatuation with money , art , and luxury , dawdles with a same sex infatuation with the spoiled brat of the family only to find love with the brat's sister under the influence of a journey to Venice , and ultimately has to face the realities of class distinction , religious bigotry , and a family history in tatters . WW I and WW II influence the development of the tale and in the end our middle class lad must clearly see the shallow shell that once represented all he could imagine as desirable . Matthew Goode heads the cast as the lad in question and the Brideshead Marchmain family is played to perfection by Emma Thompson , Michael Gambon , Ben Winshaw , Haley Atwell . The numerous smaller roles are shaped by such fine actors as Greta Scacchi , Felicity Jones , Ed Stoppard , Jonathan Cake , etc . The settings in throughout England , Venice and Morocco are stunning and the creative forces behind the costuming , music , lighting , and photography all deserve kudos . For this viewer this is one of the more satisfying films of the past year . Grady Harp
The View from the Other Side of the Bridge	THE WAR WITHIN is a profoundly disturbing movie while at the same time a film that should be seen by as wide an audience as possible . Wearing blinders in an era when terrorism is such a threat does not make fear go away . Learning the mindset of those who perpetrate terrorist acts provides some invaluable insights that may , just may , reduce the schism between factions that in reality are simply separate groups with profound beliefs and fears . Hassan ( Ayad Akhtar , who co-wrote the script ) is a Pakistani , American-educated youth in Paris for graduate training when he is abducted in the streets of Paris as a suspect dissident . Transported to Pakistan and incarcerated in a small cell with another victim Khalid ( Charles Daniel Sandoval ) the two survive brutal interrogations and torture at the hands of Americans for information they do not have . The story then jumps three years forward , finding a radically different , bruised Hassan returning to America hidden in a ship's container . His experiences have changed him to a religious Islamic devotee and he joins a terrorist cell in New Jersey to take part in terrorist suicide bombings of New York City . Hassan visits his dear friend Sayeed ( Firdous Bamji ) and his family and sister with whom Hassan , though attracted , cannot pursue for religious reasons . The family notes Hassan's mental changes and grows concerned for him , eventually finding out about his terrorist intentions . The inner workings of the terrorist cell bring much light as to the religious drive toward martyrdom , and slowly we begin to understand Hassan's motivations and convictions - a fact that allows us to find compassion for a soul driven to acts of violence and extinction . It is terrifying but at the same time desperately moving . The film's script is multilingual with subtitles when English is not spoken , but there is a major problem with the soundtrack in that much of the dialogue is so soft or whispered that it simply cannot be heard - and the dialogue is important . Director Joseph Castelo paces this dark story well , allowing the inner thoughts of each of the varied characters to emerge gradually . The cinematography is appropriately toned and the acting is absolutely first rate . THE WAR WITHIN goes beyond the realm of a terrorist story and personalizes the individual wars within each of us in this time of global chaos . For one of the first times we are allowed to see how sensitive young people can metamorphose into suicide bombers , and observing that transformation is heartbreaking . A brilliant little film and one Highly Recommended . Grady Harp
A Little Zoë Cassavetes Triumph	BROKEN English has so many of the elements of films that are becoming difficult to find these days - superb intelligent script , a story that is frankly what it is instead of an overdone parody of itself , a director who knows how to pace a storyline to keep it compelling , and a cast of first class actors who have the gift of diving right to the core of characters we all meet every day and making us care about them . Writer / director Zoë Cassavetes may be young in her trade , but she here gives evidence that she clearly knows her way about creating fine movies ! Nora Wilder ( a mesmerizingly fine Parker Posey ) has looks , a good job as a client relations director of a smart New York hotel , but she is now in her thirties and in comparison to her friends she is a social wasteland . She simply cannot find a satisfying relationship in this time of fast one night stands . Her mother ( Gena Rowlands ) is supportive of her plight and her best friend Audrey ( Drea De Mateo , proving that she indeed is a fine actress ) who is supposedly in a ' good marriage ' with Mark ( Tom Guinee ) understands her needs and is willing to help , but all Nora can end up with are losers like mouthy actor Nick Gable ( Justin Theroux ) and morning after hangovers - until she encounters Frenchman Julien ( Melvil Poupaud ) . Julien sees and appreciates Nora for who she is and while Nora seems on the brink of having found the perfect guy , her past history of failed romances prevents her from staying in the moment . But when Julien must return to Paris ( seemingly the door of exit for yet another mismatch ) , Nora eventually gathers her courage and accompanied by Audrey sets off to Paris in hopes of joining the effervescent Julien . In Paris the two women search but cannot find Julien , but what Nora finds is herself - and that is rewarded by a climax that brings the film to a satisfying close . Though Parker Posey has given us some excellent independent film roles in the past , nothing can match the magic she brings to this role . In fact the entire cast is so fine and so well motivated and directed by Cassavetes that every detail of the film is polished and shines like a the little triumph the film is . Highly recommended .

Art is the Common Denominator	BORN INTO BROTHELS won the Academy Award for documentaries : it should have also won the Humanitarian Award . Zana Briski and Ross Kauffman have not only created a captivating film about the plight and survival instincts of a group of eight children who were born to prostitutes in the red light district of Calcutta : they have given us a visual montage of the images captured by these children , through the cameras as lovingly instructed by Briski , that look back at the environment in which they are living . Without being the least bit preachy , Briski and Kauffman entered the infamous red light district , moved in so as not to seem voyeurs , and while Briski continued her long and successful portfolio of the women who ply their wares as the only means to overcome poverty , they discovered that the children of the prostitutes were curious , bright , and desirous of learning the magic the camera can produce . We meet each of the eight children ( three boys and five girls ) , learn the background and outlook of each and then watch as they embrace photography . Their photographs are so fine and their futures so grim that Briski and Kauffman pledge themselves to find paths of escape from their doomed state . Briski works to place them in boarding schools and enters their photographs in an international Press Group exhibition in Amsterdam . The children have such pride and personal growth that they are thrilled when on boy is selected to represent them at the exhibition in Amsterdam . Briski also arranges for exhibitions of the photographs , both internationally and locally so that all of the children can view their art in a respected place . Yet after elevating the future outlook of these eight children we see that only a few continue to have bright futures : the shame of their social caste and the mark of their ' criminal ' parents is stamped on them forever . Some escape , others join the line . The photography is splendid , rich in color and subject matter , and the video camera following Briski through the squalid red light district , pausing to hear abusive mothers and drugged fathers deny their children passage into a better life , hearing the wisdom of the elders who desire something more for these children , captures a world few know . Devoted as Briski and Kauffman are to their dream , they remain realistic and document an element of life in a third world country that is illuminating . This is a touching film without being maudlin , beautiful without ignoring reality . In English and with subtitles for the children's commentary . Highly Recommended for all viewers . Grady Harp
Transplantation Successful !	Anton Chekhov's play ' Uncle Vanya ' has been re-written and transplanted to turn of the century South Wales in this production , which is directed by Anthony Hopkins . For all of the many translations and rebirths of this ' comedy ' by the great Chekhov , this one seems to work best . There really is very little linear storyline , but it is filled with the author's recurring themes of unfulfilled dreams , boredom , longing for an elusive future . The plot ( ! ) is really a discourse among the players : Ieuan Davies ( Anthony Hopkins ) is a bored older man who spends his days drinking and talking with his small family and servants on the country estate owned by Professor Alexander Blathwaite ( Leslie Phillips ) who comes for a stay with his beautiful wife Helen ( Kate Burton ) for whom Davies lusts and pines . A doctor ( Gawn Grainger ) visits , stirs discontent while mixing in family gossip and caring for the victim of a mine explosion . The bulk of the dialogue is centered on some fine expositions about women's rights , class inequality , and Davies ' boredom with life , his aborted chances on having a significant life , and his longing for a future that seems as elusive as the summer breeze that fans the tea garden in this wistful , atmospheric setting . To enjoy ' August ' the viewer must be in the mood for conversation , wit , banter , and ensemble acting , and given those prerequisites , this film is a joy . Hopkins gives a magnificent performance , loathable and lovable , and the entire cast is so polished that the play becomes chamber music . Hopkins not only stars but also directs ( not always successfully attending to the small details of action ) , and also provides the musical score - no mean feat ! Not a film of action this , but rather a summer reverie piqued by subtle comedy . Grady Harp
A Breathless , Intelligent , Finely Honed Part 3 of the Bourne Series	Paul Greengrass has stepped into the director's shoes for this third installment of the Jason Bourne identity crisis and in doing so has created nearly two hours of tension that would make Robert Ludlum proud ! This is an example of how Hollywood can shine when it integrates all of the components of an ' action suspense thriller ' by capitalizing on finding the best contributors available - actors , producers , cameramen , stunt men , script ( Tony Gilroy , George Nolfi and Scott Z . Burns ) , composer of music ( John Powell ) , editors - everyone of the hundreds required to pull off this superlative film . It is as fine as any thriller can be and reflects the intensity of concentration and understatement and respect for the viewers ' intellect that crowned his excellent UNITED 93 and THE BOURNE SUPREMACY . The result is a polished movie that remains compelling form the opening frame to the final credits . For those who have read or watched Ludlum's Bourne trilogy the story line is at core very simple : Jason Bourne has lost his memory and struggles through terrifying confrontations with all governments and potential assassins , endures relentless chases , and defies the machinations of the world's intelligence sources to discover his true identity . The rest of the novels and films are the how . Matt Damon has come into his own as an electrifying screen presence as Jason Bourne : his acting is keen and his ability to hold our concern through impossible situations would be difficult to duplicate by other actors of this genre . The supporting cast includes such superb actors as Joan Allen , David Strathairn , Scott Glenn , Albert Finney , Paddy Considine , Daniel Brühl , Joey Ansah and a very large cast of others . The pacing and use of Intelligence techniques is extraordinary and is beautifully captured by the cinematography of DP Oliver Wood and finessed by the editing of Christopher Rouse . One aspect of this film that is the most frightening is to observe just how invasive the Intelligence portions of our government can be : there seemingly are no secrets about even the most personal aspects of our lives that cannot be flashed on multiscreens in the war room of the CIA and associated organizations . Perhaps this film will be a red flag to alert public attention as to how our right to privacy has been so visibly raped by the government in the name of security - a factor that makes watching this excellent movie even more terrifying !

Popcorn and Tang and Other Evidences of Desperation	FROZEN RIVER marks an impressive debut for writer / director Courtney Hunt : here is a filmmaker that not only knows how to weave a powerful story with pacing that rarely takes a break for breathing , but one who also knows how to pull intensely dramatic performances from actors in that rarest arena of ensemble acting . Though many viewers may avoid this film because of its suggestion of uncompromising sadness and depression in a time when ' escape movies ' seem to draw the larger audiences , simply giving into this story will offer insights into human behavior - from adults and children , from minority groups , and from the disenfranchised - that allow the ending of the story to resonate subtly and memorably . Ray Eddy ( Melissa Leo ) lives with her two sons , teenager T . J . ( the gifted young Charlie McDermott ) and 5-year-old Ricky ( James Reilly ) , in a shabby trailer house in the icy tundra where New York state meets Canada adjacent to a Mohawk Indian reservation . Ray's gambling addicted husband has deserted his family with the money being saved for a better , larger trailer house , and Ray is left to forge for her boys at her menial job , living paycheck to paycheck and forced to feed her children popcorn and Tang for meals . To make ends meet she attempts to find her missing husband and instead encounters his car as stolen by young Mohawk Lila ( Misty Upham ) . Their confrontation leads to Ray and Lila partnering in smuggling immigrants ( Chinese and Pakistani ) from Canada to the US via drives across the frozen St . Lawrence river . How these two disparate women find common threads under desperate circumstances provides the bulk of this amazingly rich story . Hunt manages to explore poverty , the displaced American Indian situation , smuggling , State Trooper mentality , and the extraordinary manner in which children left to their own parent-less devices manage to stay above sinking with such skill that the incredible story being told seems like across the fence conversation - it is that real . The entire cast is exceptional , not only Leo and Upham , but all of the actors in even the smallest roles . This is a film to embrace , not avoid , as it speaks to the indomitable human spirit .

A Microcosm of Deftly Drawn Characters . . . and Life	A day in the life on Wilby Island , off Nova Scotia , may not sound like a resource for rich storytelling , but in the gifted hands of writer / director Daniel MacIvor and inordinately talented Canadian cast WILBY WONDERFUL penetrates more dark secrets , exposes more astray lives , and addresses more human frailties than almost all of the competition . This is independent film-making at its finest , with all of the emphasis on quality and little concern for the big budget special effects that mire so many films today . On the little island , divided between islanders and mainlanders ' visiting ' , lives an array of lonely people . We are introduced to a ' cause celebre ' that happened on the beach ( though the facts are hazy ) and investigating the scandal are police officers Buddy French ( Paul Gross ) and his somewhat loose cannon Stan ( portrayed by MacIvor himself ) . Buddy's wife Carol ( Sandra Oh ) is a very busy real estate person , assisted by her doofus secretary Deena ( Kathryn MacLellan ) , out to sell a home to the town mayor ( Maury Chaykin ) and family ( Susannah Hoffman and Marcella Grimaux ) , and while Carol is fretting over details , her meandering husband Buddy is secreting an affair with island returnee wannabe café owner Sandra Anderson ( Rebecca Jenkins ) , whose libidinous past negatively influences her young daughter Emily ( Ellen Page ) in her new physical tryst with young Taylor ( Caleb Langille ) . And while each of these stories unfolds , the town gossip Irene ( Mary Ellen MacLean ) keeps her evil eye on the soon-to-be-made apparent scandal that video store owner Dan Jarvis ( James Allodi ) , who spends the entire movie attempting variations on suicide , and town painter Duck MacDonald ( Callum Keith Rennie ) are to be outed as being gay . It is the strange interplay of each of these lonely , needy characters that brings brilliant focus to the tiny bit of reality that is actually heartfelt . MacIvor and friends pull off this strange little black comedy with ease and aplomb and the film is a charmer in every way - from script to cinematography ( Rudolf Blahacek ) to musical score ( Michael Timmins ) . This is a splendid little movie that deserves a very wide audience . Grady Harp
The Many Facets of Stephen Sondheim's SWEENEY TOD	When it comes to a work of the musical stage it is difficult to imagine a finer one than Stephen Sondheim's SWEENEY TODD : THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET . For those who saw the original 1979 Hal Prince extravagant production starring Angela Lansbury and Len Cariou / George Hearn , and then the 2005 revival as condensed so creatively by John Doyle and re-orchestrated by Sarah Travis who placed the orchestral instruments in the hands of the 10 actors who tell the story of the strange Todd , the Tim Burton ( screenplay reduction by Josh Logan ) film will only enhance the pleasures of seeing SWEENEY TODD resurrected in yet another form . Each of these incarnations has its riches and together they establish Sondheim's work as a masterpiece . Johnny Depp makes a convincing Sweeney Todd , in looks and demeanor as well as in singing voice , and Helena Bonham Carter's Mrs . Lovett fits right into Tim Burton's vision of the dark , squalid and seedy London . Timothy Spall is perfect as the oily Beadle , Alan Rickman makes Judge Turpin an understandable villain , Jamie Campbell Bower and Jayne Wisener are suitably infatuated young lovers , and Sacha Baron Cohen and Ed Sanders give top flight cameos as Signor Pirelli and Toby . The one advantage of seeing this fine film on DVD is the option of turning on the subtitles so as not to miss a word of Sondheim's superb lyrics . For this viewer , however , the most successful version of this ' opera ' is the John Doyle production currently on the boards in Los Angeles with Judy Kaye as the most satisfying Mrs . Lovett on record . This uniquely economical and endlessly creative production goes to the core of the work better than any other version , and if this traveling company comes anywhere near your home , go see it ! It is the essential SWEENEY TODD and a fine adjunct to seeing the film version again and again . Grady Harp
Silences and Merging with Nature Create This Luminous Elegy	Aleksandr Sokurov in MAT I SYN ( MOTHER AND SON ) has succeeded in capturing those brief , breathing moments that surround death , freezing them in an timeless mold like a shell in a crystal mass , something that goes beyond the passage of time and captures the essence of extended farewells . This brief film is one of the most probing and tender embraces of the meeting / meaning of life and death , of the continuity of a mother's soul in the form of her son , and most important , it is an elegy about the quiet power and beauty of nature . A son ( Aleksei Ananishnov ) comforts his terminally ill mother ( Gudrun Geyer ) with gentle caresses , combing her hair , sharing dreams that are identical , and providing solace in every way imaginable . The mother asks for a walk and the son carries her in his arms to a vantage of the sea and through the gnarled trunks of the woods , a path marked by poplars . He carries her back to the little house , and as she sleeps he walks by himself , observing a little train ( a departure ) in the distance , a sole ship ( a departure ) gliding on the ocean , and amidst all this natural beauty he clings to an old tree in a tearful embrace . He returns and his mother has died : the cycle of life is complete . Throughout this seemingly simple film Sokorov concentrates on silence , the little dialogue that is spoken is from the gentle script by Yuri Arabov . The ' actors ' are appropriately not actors ( Ananishnov is a Professor of Mathematics ! ) . The sounds are of nature - rumbling thunder , wind in the trees - and the minimal music is appropriately by Mikhail Glinka and Otmar Nussio with original music by Mikhail Ivanovich . The cinematography by Aleksei Fyodorov is likely greatly influenced by Sokurov's vision : each frame is a still life of nature both with and without the two characters , and with the use of filters , mirrors and broken glass the images are indescribably beautiful . Filmed on the island of Rügen close to the coast of Germany the atmosphere is pure and unhindered by peripheral marks of civilization . Sokurov's 1997 film and his subsequent films OTETS I SYN ( ' FATHER AND SON ' ) and RUSSKIY KOVCHEG ( ' RUSSIAN ARK ' ) have established him as one of the most creative filmmakers of today . Highly recommended , especially for those who appreciate art , nature , and the humbling magnificence of the cycle of life . Grady Harp
Fascinating Story , Brilliant Acting and Directing	The French have a way with steamy films that makes the rest of the cinematic world seem bland in comparison . NATHALIE is fine case in point . Based on an idea by Philippe Blasband and transformed into a superb screenplay by Jacques Fieschi , François-Olivier Rousseau and the director Anne Fontaine , this incredibly well acted , subtle , understated film explores the many facets of adultery - from the woman's point of view . The result is a suspenseful , erotic , intelligent film that provides an opportunity for three of France's greatest actors to demonstrate their credentials . Catherine ( the still very beautiful and gifted Fanny Ardant ) is a gynecologist married to the successful Bernard ( Gérard Depardieu in one of his more subtle roles ) and they have a stay-at-home hippy son ( Rodolphe Pauly ) who goes about his life much the same as his parents : there is superficial companionship but little in depth relationship . The marriage seems satisfactory until Catherine suspects Bernard of having affairs , a fact that Bernard very honestly confesses to having : in his eyes the affairs are sexual dalliances that mean nothing . Catherine is shocked , attempts to gain some support from her insular but worldly mother ( a fine Judith Magre ) who tells Catherine it is a normal situation in older marriages . Catherine visits a bar , a private club for consignations , and there she meets Marlène ( the extraordinary Emmanuelle Béart ) and eventually buys Marlène's services as a prostitute to meet her husband and then tell her all about the encounters . It is agreed that Marlène will be known as ' Nathalie ' . From this point on Catherine and Nathalie meet after Nathalie has encounters with Bernard and describes the acts of the encounters in vivid and lurid detail . Catherine is fascinated and continues to pay Nathalie for on going encounters and subsequent voyeuristic descriptions . Catherine even has a one-night stand of her own with bartender François ( Wladimir Yordanoff ) in an attempt to understand her husband's need for infidelity . Despite the setup of ' private investigator and prostitute detective ' the two women become friends . When Catherine realizes she has enough evidence against Bernard to leave him there is a final encounter of the three ( Catherine , Bernard , Nathalie ) that brings the ingenious surprise ending - an ending to fine to share as it would spoil the film for viewers new to the story . Ardant is simply radiant as Catherine , playing the role of the victim wife of an adulterous husband with supreme dignity . Likewise Depardieu makes his Bernard so understated and profoundly honest that the conclusion in retrospect should have been suspected . Béart is at once wholly physical in her prostitute role yet maintains the inner core of a confused woman that keeps us on her side as she does her job . The production values are all first rate ( except for some ragged editing ) and the direction of Anne Fontaine is bristling with intrigue and wholly convincing in her development of this strange tale . Despite the dialogue being X-rated there is very little actual sex in this film : that makes it not only more powerful but as the ending is revealed adds to the solidity of the story . In French with English subtitles . Highly recommended for art film lovers . Grady Harp
The Belly of the Beast	NOTE : According to the dictionary : Mandragora is 1 ) a plant of nightshade family : a plant with a forked root resembling a human body that was formerly believed to have magical powers and was made into a drug and 2 ) a 14th century alteration of medieval Latin mandragora , influenced by man , drake " dragon " ( from its emetic and narcotic properties ) . MANDRAGORA , the astonishing film from the Czech Republic written by Wiktor Grodecki ( who also directs ) and David Svec ( who also acts in the film ) , is aptly named : mandragora is the world of male prostitution that seduces young lads with promises of money and ultimately poisons them with the burning disease of loss of self respect and ultimately of life . Marek ( Miroslav Caslavka in a stunning performance ) is a beautiful 15-year-old kid from a little village in the Czech Republic who has aligned himself with petty criminals to have better things such as classy clothing , a lad whose single father ( Jirí Kodes ) demands he stay in school ( yet is always in the background to salvage Marek's errant life situations ) and who seems to be prepping his son for a better life . Marek hates school , which he sees as merely a path to be a welder like his father . The father and son collide after another crime spree and Marek leaves home for the big city promises of Prague . Once in Prague Marek is observed by the pimp Honza ( Pavel Skripal ) who follows Marek , knowing that Marek's future in the city is doomed without Honza's ' protection ' . Within a day's time Marek's luck with the slot machines dries up and Honza convinces him to be his ' rabbit ' - a male prostitute . Marek's first encounter with an American ' john ' ends disastrously and the beaten Marek returns to the streets where he encounters a fellow hustler David ( David Svec ) . Together they forge an alliance to escape Honza's compound and begin a life of successful prostitution . They are bonded ( the probability of Marek's actually being gay and physically attracted to David is strong ) and together they encounter all manner of unseemly characters involved in the underbelly of Prague's male prostitution life . Characters weave in and out of Marek's and David's life , each time leaving scars that grow more visible as does the threat of drug problems and AIDS . They eventually consent to embrace the lowest level of making gay porn where the cruel director forces Marek to be sodomized by David . They are raided by the police and Honza reappears as Marek's nemesis . Through a series of drug-induced hallucinations and dreams Marek envisions what his future holds and his descent is stamped . Yet at this point Marek's father journeys to Prague in search of his son , discovers his life style , is terrified and angry and tangentially passes Marek in a critical final scene that is devastatingly sad . This film is dark , frank , cruel , realistic , and sweats with the evil of the belly of the beast that is Prague's underworld . Yet the direction is so fine and , equally important , the acting by Miroslav Caslavka so sensitive that we as the audience are swept into an overwhelming compassion for these unfortunate lads whose seemingly only hope for a better life is one of humiliating degradation . MANDRAGORA is a no holds barred examination of a dark life that maintains a precarious balance between caricature and character development . Yes , it is lengthy at 126 minutes , in need of editing in areas , has faulty subtitles , and a strange musical score by Wolfgang Hammerschmid who extrapolates Puccini's ' Nessun dorma ' and Bach's ' Erbarme dich ' and ' Ruhe sanft ' from the St Matthew Passion for heavy effects , and very dark cinematography by Vladimír Holomek , but despite these sidebar problems , they only slightly mar the overall impact of a very important film .

Awe : The Quiet Curiosity and Fear When Worlds First Meet	Terrence Malick is a master of understatement and it is that quality of his writing and directing that makes THE NEW WORLD so luminous an experience for the viewer . Though the historical material in this film has been told and written and filmed to exhaustion , Malick finds that awe and wonder as the Old World of the King James ' England puts ashore on the pure and unsoiled land of Virginia of 1607 to an audience of naively innocent ' naturals ' who are as fascinated with the arrivals of the visitors as the English are curious yet fearful of the ' savages ' they may face in this new place . This is an interior film that just happens to be filmed in the wonders of the meadows and rivers and seaside of nature resplendent . Malick has wisely elected to have the meeting between the naturals and the English remain in their own languages : the Indians speak a beautiful language that is not translated for the audience , a fact that adds to the feeling of ' the other ' on both sides . And it is this separateness that makes the story credible . Upon landing Captain Newport ( Christopher Plummer ) cancels the scheduled hanging of Captain John Smith ( Colin Farrell ) and sets rules for the newly formed Jamestown , which he soon leaves to return to England , leaving Captain Smith in charge . It is Smith's duty to meet with the naturals in an attempt to gain needed food supplies . The magic that occurs with this meeting of ' the stranger ' with the naturals is the epitome of discovery . Smith is saved from execution by the Chief Powhatan's ( August Schellenberg ) favored daughter Pocahontas ( Q'Orianka Kilcher ) and lives with the naturals , learning their innocence of spirit and falling in love with Pocahontas . But Smith is returned to his fort , suffers misadventures among his own men , sustains attacks by the disenchanted naturals , and eventually returns to England , telling his friend to inform Pocahontas that he has drowned . Pocahontas is outcast from her community because of her kindness to the English and is placed in Jamestown where she is ' assimilated ' by the new arrival of English . Among the new arrivals is John Rolfe ( Christian Bale ) who falls in love with Pocahontas and though she does not love Rolfe she consents to the arranged marriage because Rolfe is kind and because she believes her beloved Smith to be dead . The two have a child and Rolfe takes his little family to England where Pocahontas is presented at court for her invaluable aid to the English . She discovers Smith is still alive , dies , and Rolfe and son return to Jamestown . No spoilers , these : this is historically accurate reporting of stories we have all known from grade school . All of this majestic story is told primarily in silence with the stream of conscious dialogue from each character spoken in voice over . The sounds of nature accompany the action in an eerily perfect manner . Many have praised James Horner's musical score for this film and it is a score that contributes to the beauty of the film : the fact is there is little original music here , the use of Wagner's ' Das Rheingold ' accompanies the extended opening and recurs for the big moments while Mozart's Piano Concerto No . 23 is used extensively for the quiet moments . Yes , it works , but there is not much other original music to praise . But that is the only quibble with those who have raved about this film . It does weave its spell under Malick's understanding eye and is beautifully cast with first-rate actors who are asked to render their characters physically and with their eyes rather than words . Farrell , Kilcher , Bale , Thewlis , Plummer and the large supporting cast are exemplary . What , then , Malick has given us in this majestic film is that sense of wonder of the unknown , the thin thread between curiosity and threat that spins the coming together of cultures . And that sense of awe is still propelling the forces of the world today . If only all such interactions would hold the respect of this initial encounter . Highly recommended . Grady Harp
" There really isn't anything else "	And so reflects 70-something Maurice ( Peter O'Toole ) about the importance of beauty and searching for love as the only significant goals as life races by him . VENUS is a small miracle of a film written by Hanif Kureishi ( ' My Beautiful Laundrette ' ) about the isolation and inner devastation of growing old in today's society . What could have been a morose , whining diatribe about the cruelties of advancing age and the manner in which we treat the elderly becomes a window into the psyche of older characters whose lives have meant something - if to no one else but themselves . Three old thespian friends and colleagues ( Maurice , Ian - Leslie Phillips and Donald - Richard Griffiths ) spend there days reading obits , sharing pills and recalling the days of their acting glory . Maurice has not given up as he still performs as old characters in films and continues his lifelong libidinous longing for beautiful females . Ian fears death from hypertension and agrees to have his niece's daughter Jessie ( Jodie Whittaker ) move in to care for him . But the coarse , crude , and rude Jessie drives Ian to distraction and Ian seeks Maurice's aid in diverting Jessie's time to activity away from her home care service . The story thus opens the way to examine the needs and desires of both Maurice and the very young Jessie , each finding a sense of solace , friendship and a new kind of love despite their extreme age differences . Maurice continues to visit his ex-wife Valerie ( Vanessa Redgrave ) whenever he needs a connection to reality : these encounters speak more about the continuity of love once splintered than in almost any prior film . In a story that could have focused on aged lechery and youthful opportunism this film , as directed by Roger Michell , instead elects to find the path toward beauty that underlines the needs of disparate people . The performance by O'Toole is staggeringly superb and the remainder of this small cast ( Redgrave , Griffiths , Phillips - all long admired , seasoned pros - and Whittaker , a very promising new face ) is top notch . The writing and directing and acting in this film is at the peak of excellence - there really isn't anything else . Grady Harp
A Raw Story That Gleams Like a Diamond	THE PROPOSITION is one of the more satisfying ' westerns ' to come along in years . Just as Serge Leone created the spaghetti westerns in Italy and set a precedent that American films were to follow , so director John Hillcoat and writer Nick Cave turn the back country of 1880s Australia into a devastating impressive work of grit , dirt , lawlessness and hardship of living in the early days of Australia's distance from Britain . This is an art piece sculpted from brilliant actors , some of the finest photography on the screens today , and a film score that is breathtakingly beautiful . Shot almost entirely in shades of umber and sienna THE PROPOSITION is the tale of a gang of brothers - Charlie Burns ( Guy Pearce ) , Mikey Burns ( Richard Wilson ) and hooligan and evil Arthur Burns ( Danny Huston ) - who have wrecked havoc on a frontier town under the eye of police Captain Stanley ( Ray Winstone ) , married to the lovely Martha Stanley ( Emily Watson ) , and the extremes to which the law will go to capture the worst of the perpetrators , Arthur . After a gruesome shoot out Charlie and Mikey are captured , but Captain Stanley propositions Charlie to bring in his loathsome brother Arthur to spare young brother Mike from the gallows on Christmas . Charlie rides out to find Arthur , encounters a bounty hunter Jellon Lamb ( a brilliant tour de force role for John Hurt ) , mixes with the aborigines , and ultimately confronts Arthur . And that is quite enough of the story to relate in brief . It is the quality of the film that takes your breath away . Not only is the acting utterly first rate by the entire large cast , but the rhapsody of imagery created by the camera of Benoît Delhomme and the haunting score from the pens of Nick Cave and Warren Ellis give us a frame after glowing frame gallery of some of the most beautiful film ever made . This is a movie so rich in story and production that it is bound to become considered as one of the greats of the western ilk . Highly recommended ( for those who can tolerate a lot of violence ! ) .

An Intelligent , Well Written Controversial Film	HARRY AND MAX goes where films have dared ( at least American films ) : consensual incestuous relationships between two brothers . Writer / director Christopher Münch ( ' The Sleepy Time Gal ' , ' The Hours and Times ' , ' Color of a Brisk and Leaping Day ' ) has previously proved that he is unafraid to take on tough subject matter and make it poetically beautiful . In HARRY AND MAX he has created an intelligent reverie about hopes , dreams , expectations , disappointments , and filial love that is as fascinating as it is unique . Max ( Cole Williams ) is a 16-year-old teen idol whose career is managed by his mother ( Michelle Phillips ) . His 23-year-old brother Harry ( Bryce Johnson ) began the family trend toward teen band idols and now is living on his past glories in music trips to the still-adoring masses in Japan while he sinks into alcoholism . Max longs for companionship and more with Harry and as the film opens we find them on a long-awaited camping trip in California's San Gabriel mountains , exploring the old Mt Lowe Railway . Their similarities and differences unfold in natural , unforced conversation and when night falls and they retire to their tent , Max makes physical overtures to Harry , overtures Harry does not resist . It is clear through occult references to a family outing in Bermuda that the two have had intimate relations but the details are intentionally left foggy . For the remainder of the weekend trip the two brothers confide their family problems ( Harry never felt as accepted as Max and left home early on ) , Max's gay affair with 40-year-old Josiah ( Tom Gilroy ) , Harry's current affair with Roxanne ( Roni Deitz ) and his mishandled affair with Nikki ( Rain Phoenix ) , a girl who subsequently married and divorced and is now a close friend with Max . Once the inherent tensions are blocked out , the two brothers explore the current paramours of the other : Harry seduces Josiah , Max attempts to seduce Nikki , and the secret of the brothers ' incestuous relationship becomes open knowledge . Harry truly loves Max and Max returns that love but feels Harry must find his own life without leaning on Max's new idol popularity . The final solutions are unveiled in a time jump two years later when Harry and Max and Max's lover Jordan ( Justin Zachary ) meet in a conversation that more fully explains the differences and similarities between the two brothers . Christopher Münch keeps the story rolling with casual precision , using effective sun-drenched flashbacks to illuminate the boys ' childhood . He has garnered fine performances from his cast : Cole Williams and Bryce Johnson are superb and cameo roles by Michelle Phillips , Justin Zachary , and Tom Gilroy are first rate . The only weak link is Rain Phoenix who mimes her way through the pivotal role of Nikki , reducing the tension when it should be building . The sexual scenes are handled with utmost sophistication , sensual without being graphic . In all , this is a terrific little film , small in budget and technique but enormous in thought and impact . Highly recommended . Grady Harp
