Everyone Should Buy the Farm	" A young man inherits his uncle's western ranch and invites his friends to come along and help out with the operation . After arriving , the caretaker explains to the group the legend of the headless horseman who roams the area to seek revenge . Laughing off the legend as the ramblings of an old man , the group are then shocked when the phantom rider appears , causing the deaths of some of the group , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis ? This is one of those films for which even the lowest ranking seems too elevated - but , perhaps it's earned by walk-on Ultra Violet's " Superman " lunchbox .

" I'll Sign ! " " I'll Sign ! " " I'll Sign ! " " I'll Sign ! " " I'll Sign ! " " I'll Sign ! "	Ronald Reagan and a bunch of US soldiers in a North Korean POW camp . They are tortured . . . We learn North Korean Communists are bad people . . . We learn Americans ' beards grow very slowly during days of torture . . . I tried to suppress it , but I finally burst out laughing at this movie . It was the scene when Mr . Reagan comes out from telling the Communists he wants to be on their side . Then , he asks for a bottle of brandy . Next , acting stone-cold sober , he takes a drunken companion , Dewey Martin , to get sulfur to cure Mr . Martin's hangover . Of course , the North Korean communist guard is as dumb as they come . So , the drunk distracts the guard while Reagan goes over to get something from a drawer , which is next to a bunch of empty boxes . I'm sure he boxes were supposed to contain something ; but , of course , Reagan causes them to shake enough to reveal they are empty . Ya gotta laugh ! I think " Prisoner of War " will appeal mainly to family and friends of those who worked on it - otherwise , it's wasteful .

How Not to Act	Yikes ! This movie begins with a Knight riding by on a horse , singing a little ditty about Knightly daring douze . Though this film was made around the same time as " Shane " , Alan Ladd looks quite different ; he appears to be ill in many scenes . Since Mr . Ladd's stuntman is very energetic , he might have been a better choice to play the lead role of " John " in this film . Peter Cushing has a very deep tan , which made me wonder if , perhaps , the actors thought they were being filmed in " Black and White " ? Oh well , I guess Mr . Cushing would have recognized that color cameras are different . Still , the movie has a very inexpensive look . I was so distracted by the costumes , I lost track of the plot . There is some fire , and they try to burn a man in a cage , but Mr . Ladd interferes with the burning . He also saves the woman This movie has no trouble earning a most " awful " rating .

The Butler Doesn't Do It	" Margaret Wilson ( Frances Redd ) is the daughter of a well-respected small town family , who is courted by local man Buster Barnett ( Edward Brandon ) and a traveling carnival mentalist , Prince Alihabad ( Laurence Criner ) . When Margaret's father turns up dead after showing his oil well deed to his daughter's suitors , she decides to track down her father's killer herself ( by hiring ) a private investigator and his bumbling assistant , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . " Midnight Shadow " is an embarrassingly poor , segregated production . Midnight Shadow ( 1939 ) George Randol - Frances Redd , Laurence Criner , Edward Brandon
Smash-Up at American International	Racing enthusiast Fabian ( as Tommy Callahan ) smokes , drinks , and suffers blackouts while juggling feelings for alluring brunette Annette Funicello ( as Francie Madsen ) and blonde mainstay Diane McBain ( as Annie Blaine ) . Complicating matters are Ms . Funicello's boozy race car boyfriend Warren Berlinger ( as Eddie Sands ) , and her father Jan Murray ( as Pete Madsen ) , who encourages the reckless drivers . Funicello's cow-eyed performance is sometimes enjoyable ; however , her drunken driving scene is unnerving . " Thunder Alley " provides marginally more NASCAR excitement than its predecessor , " Fireball 500 " ( 1966 ) ; be warned , it isn't much . A wild party scene , featuring some mild strip tease , is the film's low highlight .
Swinging on a Star	Hal Le Roy in a dual role - he's a swinging saxophonist Mr . Razzenstill on his way to the country of Sulvania . There , he discovers he is a distant cousin to the country's Prince Rudolph . The prince hates Swing music , and declares that , after his coronation , the music will be banned . Swing lovers swap the identical Le Roys - and , Rudolph is thrown in his dungeon . Will he escape ? The film is far too dependent on the films it spoofs ( " The Prisoner of Zenda " ) . Given that , you can't follow the story ; for example , why does Razzenstill decide to try and rescue Rudolph ? June Allyson is the princess who seems to fall in love with the other man ; it's an interesting , but unresolved , subplot . " The Prisoner of Swing " highlight is Le Roy's expert tap dancing performance following the scene with Ms . Allyson . The Prisoner of Swing ( 1938 ) Roy Mack - Hal Le Roy , June Allyson , Eddie Foy Jr .
The Belle in Her Fall	If you've never seen a Mary Pickford film , this is not the place to start . Ms . Pickford was one of the greatest early film performers ; and , this , her first sound offering , is an artistic failure . The Helen Hayes play " Coquette " ( 1927 ) might have seemed like an ideal way to introduce a talking Pickford . Sadly , it may have contributed to her impending retirement from films ; and , Pickford continued to choose some questionable film projects . The opening scenes , with Pickford positively awful as the coquettish southern belle " Norma Besant " , are embarrassing . If you can get used to the characters , later scenes may marginally repair the damage ; in fact , the much admired " trial " and " cabin " breakdown scenes earned Pickford a " Best Actress " Oscar . Coquette ( / 29 ) Sam Taylor - Mary Pickford , Johnny Mack Brown , John St . Polis
Not So Much Wall Street	Roy Rogers ( as Roy Rogers ) and his two loyal hands George " Gabby " Hayes ( as Gabby ) and Raymond Hatton ( as Chuckawalla ) must save Mr . Rogers ' Circle R ranch from wicked New York bankers , after the cowboy hero has trouble coming up with the mortgage payments . Complicating matters : a gold-like substance is discovered on Rogers ' land . Not surprisingly , the film fails to live up to the promise of its title " Wall Street Cowboy " . Other than a " Wall St . " sign and a " New York Chronicle " newspaper , there is not much to distinguish this from any other California-located Rogers western . Fast moving transportation moves the otherwise aimless story along . Rogers sings / yodels on a few good songs , like " Ride ' em Cowboy " and " Me and the Rollin ' Hills " . Smooth , but forgettable . Wall Street Cowboy ( 1939 ) Joseph Kane - Roy Rogers , George ' Gabby ' Hayes , Raymond Hatton
Bringing Up Baby	D . W . Griffith gets his ax , kisses his wife , and tweaks his baby ; then , Woodsman Griffith is off to work . While he's chopping down trees , a huge Eagle swoops down and kidnaps his unattended baby . Mother emerges and discovers the Eagle has taken her child ; she picks up a rifle , but , wisely , thinks before shooting at the airborne pair . Instead , she goes to get Griffith and his fellow woodsmen , who must see that the baby is " Rescued from an Eagle's Nest " . Notable for its star , Lawrence Griffith , who would soon begin unprecedented success as film Director D . W . Griffith . The " special effects " look very phony - - and , that baby has incredibly odd looking feet , while in flight ! Griffith's final battle with the Eagle is mildly interesting , but there isn't much else here . It might have been a fair film if Edison and company had the bird nesting in a tree cut , or likely to be chopped down , by the woodsmen . Or , they could have made the bird a Vulture ?
Voodoo Hoodoo	" During World War II , an American agent , his butler and a plot are searching for a missing admiral when their plane crash lands on a Caribbean island . Taken in by a German doctor and his strange wife , the trio discovers the island inhabited by zombies under the control of Dr . Sangre . The doctor is attempting to use the zombies to extract information from the missing admiral to help his country's war efforts . Through the efforts of the butler , the heroes are able to turn the tables on Dr . Sangre and set his zombies against him , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . The predominance of Black actor Mantan Moreland ( as Jefferson " Jeff " Jackson ) in the film makes this a great one to watch for the " type " of racial character depicted . Pedagogical interests aside , " King of the Zombies " is a dull attempt to frighten and amuse . Strangely , Edward Kay's musical score was nominated for an Academy Award ; Mr . Kay received five score nominations in the 1940s . Henry Victor ( as Dr . Sangre ) is a Lugosi-like zombie-maker . John Archer ( as Bill Summers ) and Dick Purcell ( as Mac McCarthy ) are one too many heroes . Resident " maid " Marguerite Whitten ( as Samantha ) and " voodoo high priestess " Madame Sul-Te-Wan ( as Tahama ) easily outdistance the higher-billed women . King of the Zombies ( 1941 ) Jean Yarbrough - Mantan Moreland , Henry Victor , John Archer
A Garden Grows Quite Contrary	Some literary masterpieces are successfully adapted to the movie screen , and some are not . Strangely , Frances Hodgson Burnett's " The Secret Garden " , which seems so naturally suited for cinematic magic , falls into the latter category . This one introduces " Mary Lennox " as an attractive adult woman , who recalls her life in Misselthwaite Manor , following the death of her parents . There , young Gennie James ( as Mary ) meets her young friends , Barret Oliver ( as Dickon ) and Jadrien Steele ( as Colin ) . There are a couple of instances where the three young stars prove themselves capable : for example , the scene with Mr . Oliver examining brown twigs upon entering the garden , and the first scene played between Ms . James and Mr . Steele . Otherwise , the young performers are uneven and / or under-rehearsed . The adult performances are serviceable , at least ; Michael Hordern ( as Ben Weatherstaff ) seems truest . The setting is lovely . The ending , in which we are led to believe one of the novel's characters practically commits suicide ( pay attention , he " knows " ) by marching off to war , should be in the " hall of fame " of wretched bastardizations . The other two children are handled only slightly less perversely . Beware . The Secret Garden ( / 87 ) Alan Grint - Gennie James , Barret Oliver , Jadrien Steele
Maureen O'Hara Gets It in The End	The idea of John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara performing a western-style version of " Taming of the Shrew " is a good one ; and , the film shows some promise when Ms . O'Hara arrives ; she and Mr . Wayne appear to be in good physical shape . However , the film isn't really " Shrew " - it's " McLintock ! " If that isn't easy to see , early on , it's obvious after the scene between Mr . Wayne and his character's daughter ; his oration , while hunting fowl , is not comedy . Wayne is making a statement . Shortly following this scene , his daughter receives her spanking . There are subtle " political " observations - - for example , the use of the names " George Washington " and " Hubert Humphrey " . I could accept this as a broad comedy , but numerous scenes are not comic ; I don't know how to relate those parts to the rest of the movie in anything except a negative light . If all of the film is supposed to be comic , it fails as a consistent comedy . I would recommend watching the giant " Mud Puddle " fighting scene ; then , watch the end , with Wayne chasing O'Hara through town . If you're not into John Wayne , consider avoiding " McLintock ! " McLintock ! ( 1963 ) Andrew V . McLaglen - John Wayne , Maureen O'Hara , Patrick Wayne
Smokey Mountain Bore	Elvis Presley plays Brunet Lieutenant Josh and his Blond " hillbilly " cousin Jodie . Brunet Elvis has to secure the family of Blond Elvis ' land for an important U . S . Army base . The Elvises wrestle and stuff ; but , they never actually kiss . Yvonne Craig stands out among the busty mountain women ; later , she was one of Batman's TV Catwomen . The fun in " Kissin ' Cousins " is not in the situation ; but in picking out the Elvis " double " in the scenes where they both appear . It's fairly easy to spot the fake Elvis . There are a lot of very well-proportioned women in bikinis running around and squealing ; today , there are more satisfying ways to find that kind of entertainment . I enjoyed the song " Tender Feeling " ; but , it's actually the song " Shenandoah " with different lyrics . " Barefoot Ballad " is the most embarrassing song . The musical highlight is the song " Kissin ' Cousins " ; but , watch for the superior version at the end , not the beginning , of the film . The material in " Kissin ' Cousins " would make one good music video . As a full-length feature film , it's shameful . Kissin ' Cousins ( / 64 ) Gene Nelson - Elvis Presley , Arthur O'Connell , Yvonne Craig
They Don't Know Jack	Hollywood's attempt to turn Jack London's life into a " Jack London " adventure film isn't a bad idea ; certainly , he led an interesting , and sometimes adventurous , life . This film , however , winds up flat and unsatisfying . Most importantly , it lacks integrity . Michael O'Shea ( as London ) has some Londonesque speeches ; and , it's nice to see his bearded Jack receive " The Call of the Wild " after spending some quality time alone , in the snowy mountains , with his dog , " Buck " . Virginia Mayo and Susan Hayward are both very pretty . The film draws unfortunate " Yellow Peril " parallels between London's life and World War II , which are both strained and insulting . Jack London ( 1943 ) Alfred Santell - Michael O'Shea , Susan Hayward , Virginia Mayo
A Film Not Quite as Long as the Cold War	Excruciatingly long and expensive " epic " submarine drama directed by John Sturges . The Russians have a spy on a submarine . The submarine is on an important mission to the North Pole - nobody is sure who it might be the spy . Along for the ride to " Ice Station Zebra " are suspects : Ernest Borgnine with a Russian accent , Patrick McGoohan being Patrick McGoohan , and Jim Brown being Jim Brown . Rock Hudson tries to keep a straight face as the mission commander . I found the movie and its characters so dull , I didn't care what happened to them . The movie's obvious expense might have been appealing in its day . The film has an intermission ; and , I wondered , how many people returned for second half ? The actors look more sweaty than cold during the film's icy end . You can find more excitement in a single episode of the old " Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea " TV series . Ice Station Zebra ( 1968 ) John Sturges - Rock Hudson , Ernest Borgnine , Patrick McGoohan
Insult to Injury	The " Eastside " kids - " Mr . Wise Guy " gang leader Leo Gorcey ( as Ethelbert " Muggs " McGuiness ) , " left hand man " Bobby Jordan ( as Danny Collins ) , " right hand man " Huntz Hall ( as Glimpy Stone ) , " yes man " David Gorcey ( as Peewee ) , " no man " Bill Lawrence ( as Skinny ) , and " black-out warden " Ernest Morrison ( as Scruno ) - are railroaded into reform school , for stealing a truck . There , they encounter rival gang kid Gabriel Dell ( as Charlie Manning ) , and slightly sadistic shoe-wielding guard Dick Ryan ( as Jed Miller ) . Also , Mr . Jordan's supposedly reformed big brother , Douglas Fowley ( as Bill Collins ) is convicted of murder . Pretty girlfriend Joan Barclay ( as Ann Mitchell ) and the " kids " think Mr . Fowley is innocent . Bumbling Billy Gilbert ( as Knobby ) and Guinn Williams ( as Luke Manning ) are crooked adversaries . Moments to watch for include : the gang's brief swimsuit scene , Mr . Morrison's " white-wash " after chicken-thieving ( he cries out , " Deliver me from temptation ! " in the coop ) , and Mr . Ryan's scene-stealing shoe beating . Mr . Wise Guy ( / 42 ) William Nigh - Leo Gorcey , Bobby Jordan , Billy Gilbert
Gangster Rap	In the heart of San Francisco's Chinatown , the secretive " Bo Sing Tong " society blackmails , assassinates , and smuggles opium . Sessue Hayakawa ( as Luk Chan ) is the Chinese gang's most feared hatchet-man . After falling in love with Helen Jerome Eddy ( as Sen Chee ) , Mr . Hayakawa desires to trade in his life of crime and become a merchant prince . To do this , he must not only save some money , but also avoid being shot by the San Francisco police . Then , an assignment complicates matters considerably : Hayakawa is ordered to drive a hatchet through the skull of his beloved China doll's father , Toyo Fujita ( as Louis Toy ) , by " Bo Sing Tong " leader Marc Robbins ( as Ming Tai ) . Mr . Robbins , who runs the gambling and " hop " joint " The Royal Pekin Club " , wants young Ms . Eddy for himself . Standard fare from Hayakawa and company ; understandably , " The Tong-Man " failed to amuse actual Chinese people .
Get Along Little Doggies	Roy Rogers ( as Dr . Steve Kells ) is a wrongly accused fugitive from justice . On his way out west , he meets up with another fugitive , George " Gabby " Hayes ( as " Honest " John Whittaker ) ; together , they take up residence in an Idaho town . When Mr . Rogers ' identity is discovered , he decides to infiltrate the local gang of terrorists known as " The Border Legion " , and make amends . . . The film opens with an amusing wheel barrel stunt introducing Mr . Hayes ; though , how he emerged intact is a mystery ! Hayes is given a comic love interest - Maude Eburne ( as Hurricane ) . Hayes plays a role other than " Gabby " , but listening carefully will reveal that doesn't always prevent Roy Rogers from calling him Gabby . Jay Novello ( as Santos ) steals the show as one of Joseph Sawyer ( as Guilden ) ' s gang . You'll wonder why Rogers leaves Santos so close to a knife and horse at the end of one scene . Mr . Novello's Santos has a unusually close relationship with his boss ; their final scene is interesting . Rogers ' songs " With My Guitar and You " and " Get Along Little Doggies " are nicely inserted . None of the pluses are enough to life " The Border Legion " aka " West of the Badlands " from mediocrity , however . The Border Legion ( 1940 ) Joseph Kane - Roy Rogers , George ' Gabby ' Hayes , Jay Novello
Florence Lawrence Makes Biscuits for Biograph	Florence Lawrence makes " Her First Biscuits " for husband John R . Cumpson . But Ms . Lawrence's biscuits aren't as charming as she ; when Lawrence leaves the room , Mr . Cumpson tosses the biscuits out the window , pretending they were delicious , and leaves for work . Proud of her successful baking endeavor , Lawrence packs up her remaining biscuits , to bring to Cumpson's workplace , a " Theatrical Booking Office " . " Biograph Girl " Lawrence shines . There is mild fun in watching a slew of 1909 D . W . Griffith players acting " theatrical " after partaking of Lawrence's distasteful biscuits ! Not surprisingly , Mack Sennett is a stand-out among the bunch - - however , for the most part , the promising comedy bits / situations are far too underdeveloped to make this film a comic classic .
Chad & Jeremy - Busted in Whiskey Flats !	In Three Forks , Texas , English actors Chad ( as Dudley Leicester ) and Jeremy ( as Newton Weekes ) are being arrested for nonpayment of debts ; but , Chad ( Peter Brown ) and Joe ( William Smith ) intervene on their behalf . As it turns out , Jeremy is one of Chad ( Brown ) ' s old friends . Chad and Joe go off to track down an outlaw , and let Chad and Jeremy go free . Chad and Jeremy sing " In These Hard Times " ; then , they go to nearby Whiskey Flats . There , Chad ( Dudley ) poses as " Reverend Jones " . But , the British singing duo gets into trouble when required to perform the wedding ceremony of Peter Graves ( as Ben Conrad ) and Marlyn Mason ( as Belleflower Ferne ) , because Chad ( Dudley ) isn't a real minister . Elsewhere , Chad and Joe learn their outlaw prey is Mr . Graves , who is threatening Chad and Jeremy in Whisky Flats . . . Apparently , another " try-out " episode , this time for popular " British Invasion " singing duo Chad and Jeremy , who had recently entertained on " The Patty Duke Show " . Brown and Smith are relegated to supporting roles . Regulars Neville Brand and Philip Carey make no appearance at all .

Voici William Farnum	French-accented William Farnum ( as Drifter ) trudges from the snowy mountains of Canada , to his valley hometown . Along the way , he partners up with old Charles Sellon ( as Whitey ) , who has just finished a 20-year prison stay . In town , the men meet their stated objectives : to find work and women . Mr . Farnum and his pal get a jobs with the Canadian Lumber Company , run by Noah Berry ( as John McNary ) , after Farnum rids the town of ruthless Russell Hopton ( as Montana ) . Mr . Berry's pretty blonde daughter Phyllis Barrington ( as Bonnie McNary ) catches Farnum's eye , but she is seeing business rival Bruce Warren ( as Paul LaTour ) . Farnum , a huge silent film star beginning with " The Spoilers " ( 1914 ) , uses techniques from that medium , and stage experience ; he's interesting , at least , in this unsuccessful picture . " The Drifter " suffers from some distracting technical flaws , also . Of the supporting cast , Mr . Sellon outperforms the reliable brother of Wallace Berry . Mr . Hopton is good , also ; in one of the film's better scenes , Farnum shoots him at Church . The Drifter ( 1932 ) William O'Connor - William Farnum , Noah Berry , Phyllis Barrington
Bing Crosby Was Right	Bob Hope is an incompetent life insurance salesman who finally sells a policy - to Jesse James ! Understandably , his boss wants Mr . Hope to return the $100 , 000 to the outlaw ; if necessary , Hope is ordered to die on the job . Hope , calling himself an " eligible bachelor " , wishes that he had Jessie's girl - the pretty Rhonda Fleming , who sings . Wendell Corey plays the straight man Jesse James . Hope loses his shirt in a card game . " Alias Jesse James " is a one-joke comedy with an ending - it features a slew of western star cameos ; they help Hope and Fleming in a shootout . Bing Crosby says , " This fella needs all the help he can get . " Alias Jesse James ( 1959 ) Norman Z . McLeod - Bob Hope , Rhonda Fleming , Wendell Corey
Shooting the Breeze	The opening explains , " In the summer of 1909 , a member of the oldest American minority , a Paiute Indian named Willie Boy , became the center of an extraordinary historical event . This is what happened in the deserts of California . " The setting seems more 1969 than 1909 . The plot gets started when downtrodden Indian Robert Blake ( as Willie Boy ) is caught in a sexual liaison with his Indian mate , Katharine Ross ( as Lola ) , by her father . Believing he will be killed , Mr . Blake shoots Ms . Ross ' dad dead . Then , the couple go on the run , pursued by handsome Sheriff Robert Redford ( as " Coop " ) . Mr . Redford isn't as prejudiced as others in his posse , who'd prefer Blake be brought back dead . This film gets credit for renovating the careers of Jennings Lang and Abraham Polonsky ; but , it isn't , otherwise , very remarkable . Redford and Ross , riding on the success of " Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid " , receive relatively exaggerated billing , over Blake and Susan Clark ( as Liz Arnold ) . Robert Lipton ( as Charlie ) strums the guitar , but does not sing a theme song . The film is well-intentioned , but dull . Tell Them Willie Boy Is Here ( / 69 ) Abraham Polonsky - Robert Blake , Robert Redford , Katharine Ross
That Sinking Feeling	The acronymic " F . P . 1 " stands for " Floating Platform # 1 " . The film portends the building of an " F . P . 1 " in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean , to be used as an " air station " for transatlantic plane flights . Based a contemporary Curt Siodmark novel ; it was filmed in German as " F . P . 1 antwortet nicht " ( 1932 ) , in French as " I . F . 1 ne répond plus " ( 1933 ) , and in English as " F . P . 1 " ( 1933 ) . Soon , technology made non-stop oceanic travel much more preferable . Stars Conrad Veidt ( as Ellissen ) , Jill Esmond ( as Droste ) , and Leslie Fenton ( as Claire ) find love and sabotage on and off the Atlantic platform . Karl Hartl directed . Mr . Veidt is most fun to watch ; but , he is not convincing in the " love triangle " with Ms . Esmond and Mr . Fenton . The younger co-stars were the spouses of Laurence Olivier and Ann Dvorak , respectively . Both the concept and film have not aged well .
Not Too Funny , Not Too Frightening	Mild-mannered newspaperman Don Knotts ( as Luther Heggs ) is assigned to spend a night in his small Kansas town's " haunted house " , on the 20-year anniversary of its ghastly murder / suicide . Mr . Knotts ' experience results in a sensational story about the Simmons house , " ghost-written " by his adept rival , reporter Skip Homeier ( as Ollie Weaver ) . Mr . Homeier is , also , Knotts ' rival for the affections of busty brunette Joan Stanley ( as Alma Parker ) . Anyway , the " Rachel Courier Express " story leads to a libel suit against Knotts , from the Simmons ( the homeowner's ) relatives . Knotts is nervously appealing ; however , this characterization and film do not compare well with either " Barney Fife " or " Mr . Limpet " . The " haunted house " evenings ( ? ) , set off with an obvious stunt double , are especially disappointing . However , musician Vic Mizzy , who composed " The Addams Family " , is noticeably effective . And , the strong supporting cast is full of recognizable TV faces , including two who will join the regulars on " Bewitched " . Not too funny , not too frightening ; give it an " attaboy " , for trying . The Ghost and Mr . Chicken ( 1966 ) Alan Rafkin - Don Knotts , Joan Staley , Skip Homeier
Back Up Your Arsenal	The fourth " Tremors " feature goes back in time , to the year 1889 . " The Legend Begins " in the small city of " Perfection " , which was then " Rejection , Nevada " . As the story begins , seventeen miners are killed by the ghastly " Graboids " . Some of the characters in the present-day " Tremors " films have ancestors , both figurative and literal , in the past . Most obvious is the ever-returning Michael Gross ( as Hiram Gummer ) . Unlike his descendant , Mr . Gross is inept with firearms ; so , he hires gunslinger Billy Drago ( as " Black Hand " Kelly ) to shoot ' em up some " Dirt Dragons " . This one takes some getting used to - as it takes place in the distant past . It's like a western with miniature versions of the original film's monster " Graboids " . These tamer " Dirt Dragons " are nowhere near as terrorizing as their " Tremors " ( 1990 ) counterparts . Consequently , in this film , the characters spend an awful lot of time on the ground , which would not have happened in the original movie . And , it was weird to have the citizens give up the fight so quickly , when Gross temporarily decides to leave town . Why so helpless ? Why didn't Brent Roam ( as Juan Pedilla ) immediately rally the people to fight without Gross ? Disappointing . Tremors 4 : The Legend Begins ( 2004 ) S . S . Wilson - Michael Gross , Brent Roam , Billy Drago
Uneven Dozen	The DVD sleeve's synopsis offers a good preview : " A wealthy gentleman hosts a dinner party where he is going to reveal the heir to his fortune , in front of the thirteen guests attending the dinner . Unfortunately , only twelve people show up for dinner and the host dies before he can reveal the heir's identity . Years later , the host's daughter returns to her long boarded-up family home to discover someone is killing off the dinner guests , making everyone wonder who will be the next victim . " In the opening scene , Ginger Rogers ( as Marie Morgan and Lela ) ' s recollections introduce the " guests " , and reveal something critical about the plot . Ms . Rogers and Lyle Talbot ( as Phil Winston ) make the cast look promising ; but , the real attractions are James Eagles ( as Harold " Bud " Morgan ) and Eddie Phillips ( as Thor Jensen ) , due to the matter-of-fact way their likely relationship is depicted . This , and the " you told me to tail her " joke , near the end , are better than this otherwise dreary version of a done-to-death plot . The Thirteenth Guest ( 1932 ) Albert Ray - Ginger Rogers , Lyle Talbot , J . Farrell MacDonald
For Laughing on ye Sabbath	This film is probably most notable , in hindsight , as containing the last cinematic performance from Colleen Moore , one of the great " silent " stars of the 1920s . Ms . Moore's portrayal of Hester Prynne is neither great nor representative , but it does reveal the actress had the ability to carry on making pictures with sound . Sadly , the available material proved unworthy of Moore . This is an uninspired , and unnecessary , attempt at a more comic version of Nathaniel Hawthorne's " The Scarlet Letter " ; it is more listless than lighthearted . The drama is provided by the classic literary trio of characters : Moore as Hester Prynne , Hardie Albright as Arthur Dimmesdale , and Henry B . Walthall as Roger Chillingworth . The comedy is provided by Alan Hale as Bartholomew Hockings , William Kent as Sampson Goodfellow , Virginia Howell as Abigail Crakstone , and others . In a close call , but the comedy side of the story is slightly more entertaining . Mr . Hale's performance is the most enjoyable of the comic players ; significantly , he is able take all the attention off Mr . Albright , during one of the latter's dramatic sermons , as Reverend Dimmesdale . Mr . Walthall , who performed the same character in the far superior 1926 version , with Lillian Gish , is interesting to watch ; but , his attempt at a faithful portrayal of Chillingworth does not match the surrounding production . Adorable Cora Sue Collins plays " Pearl " Shirley Temple-like - - this is understandable , given the time of release - - consider , especially , the scene when Ms . Moore and her little girl take swords , begin a dancing march , and chant , " Boom ! Boom ! Boom ! " Cora , take a bow !
Imitation of Life	At the opening of " The Undesired " , a New York play , the audience is stunned by the incredible beauty of Corinne Griffith , who simply stands up from her seat . Brilliant theater critic , and budding playwright , Conway Tearle ( as Lee Clavering ) is among those smitten by the ravishing Ms . Griffith . Mr . Tearle insists he must meet her . Elderly gossip Tom Ricketts ( as Charles Dinwiddie ) is more shocked than enthralled , because the mysterious young woman looks exactly like a lady he dated 30 years ago ; Mr . Ricketts explains the woman was " Mary Ogden " , who should be old and feeble , presently . Griffith claims to be her lookalike's niece . But , old friend Kate Lester ( as Jane Ogelthorpe ) says " Mary Ogden " had no siblings . Griffith and Tearle fall in love . As things turn out , the originally hinted at science fiction angle is dispensed with . Before the film's " flashback " , Griffith reveals she is " an old woman of sixty , whose youth has been restored to her by a modern miracle of science . " This follows the explanation offered in writer Gertrude Atherton's autobiographical " Black Oxen " ( 1923 ) . Ms . Atherton wrote about her own " youthful " restoration . The process , or " Steinach treatment " , rejuvenated a woman's youth and vitality by X-raying her ovaries . Interestingly , in real life , actress Griffith employed a different ( and , likely , more effective ) " youth restoration " technique - - she claimed to be her own much younger sister . On film , she looks lovely , but there isn't much depth in Griffith's characterization ; she and Tearle essay a common romance . During the flashback , Griffith looks more tired than old ; and , before the process , she doesn't look at all old enough to be a " woman of sixty " . Griffith's reason for contemplating youth is not as interesting or realistic as supporting character Claire McDowell ( as Agnes Trevor ) . Ms . McDowell's motivation would have made a more interesting film . A real " flaming youth " , Clara Bow ( as Janet Oglethorpe ) , plays a delightful young " flapper " who has a crush older man Tearle . The last quarter of " Black Oxen " is missing , but it's not too difficult to determine how it all ends . Black Oxen ( 1923 ) Frank Lloyd - Corinne Griffith , Conway Tearle , Clara Bow
Consenting Angels	Originals " Sabrina Duncan " , " Jill Munroe " , and " Kelly Garrett " are not seen , nor are subsequent graduates " Kris Munroe " , " Tiffany Welles " , and " Julie Rogers " . " Charlie " ( John Forsythe ) is still running the Townsend agency , and " Bosley " is played by Bill Murray . The new angels are : " Heaven Must Be Missing an Angel " Natalie Cook ( Cameron Diaz ) , " Angel of the Morning " Dylan Sanders ( Drew Barrymore ) , and " Undercover Angel " Alex Munday ( Lucy Liu ) . Those songs introduce the angels ; and , the production is filled with music video-type songs . Ms . Diaz's bootylicious dancing proves baby has back . Ms . Barrymore's wide open shirt will push your PG-13 buttons . And , Ms . Liu's dominatrix scenes are to die for . The three as singing Swiss Maids ( if that's what they are ? you'll know the scene ) are wet dreamy . Mr . Murray's " Bosley " lacks the innocent fey-amongst-hotness manner which make David Doyle's portrayal so successful . The new angels are fine , but their screenplay is flat .

He Ain't Heavy , He's My Brother	Brawny Kevin Dillon ( as David McLean ) takes a plane to Germany , where he plans to meet his estranged brother . Upon arrival , he is told what we've seen open the film , that brother Rod Wilson ( as Michael McLean ) blew up in a car . Mr . Dillon identifies his brother's burned-beyond-recognition body by observing his tattooed arm . You'd be suspicious , and Dillon is too . He discovers his brother was ( is ? ) tied up in a web of espionage . The Berlin morgue makes room for more bodies , as unsavory types search for a missing computer disk , thought to be in one of the McLean brothers ' possession . Dillon befriends pretty blonde motorcycling Andrea Roth ( as Monika Engelmann ) who , of course , is also interested in finding the disk . Supporting actors Christopher Plummer ( as Ulrich Steiner ) , J . T . Walsh ( as Jonathan Zanuck ) , and Michael Wincott ( as Larry Gleason ) give the picture some weight . Mr . Plummer works out of the Berlin police department ; in a sex shop , he suggests a nuns in bondage video . Mr . Walsh and Mr . Wincott are situated at the American Embassy . Wincott is soft-spoken , but powerful . This was dependable character actor Walsh's last filmed appearance . So , Iain Paterson's " Hidden Agenda " is , appropriately , " Dedicated to the memory of J . T . Walsh . " Hidden Agenda ( 1998 ) Iain Paterson - Kevin Dillon , Andrea Roth , J . T . Walsh
Hide Under the Hide	After a shoot-up , Reese ( Neville Brand ) , Chad ( Peter Brown ) , and Joe ( William Smith ) feel like they've been working hard enough to ask Parmalee ( Philip Carey ) for two days off , to rest and relax . Parmalee grants the Rangers ' request under one condition : no brawling ! Sure enough , the trio are almost immediately caught in a barroom brawl . For discipline , Parmalee gives the Rangers an unenviable mission , escorting some " stinkin ' buffalo hides " out west . While Reese and Chad vie for curvaceous blonde Barbara Nichols ( as Princess ) , Chad has problems fending off curvaceous old girlfriend Marlyn Mason ( as Marianne Montaigne ) who , though married , wants to rekindle the romance . Ms . Mason leaves husband Vincent Van Lynn ( as Louis Montaigne ) , after he beats her ; so , Chad agrees to take her along , on their buffalo hide mission . Unbeknownst to the Rangers , smuggling Mr . Van Lynn has hidden contraband rifles under the skins . And , the supposedly safe journey becomes even more dangerous when Native American Indians attack . . . Laredo - A Question of Discipline ( / 65 ) R . G . Springsteen - Peter Brown , Neville Brand , William Smith
Bragging Rights	Reese ( Neville Brand ) wants to impress the absent Captain Parmalee ( Philip Carey ) , by painting his office red ; but , Chad ( Peter Brown ) and Joe ( William Smith ) talk him out of it . Meanwhile , Parmalee is escorting Texas State Senator Robert F . Simon ( as John Sparks ) to Laredo , bragging about his fine team of Rangers . Upon arrival , Parmalee and the Senator catch the Reese , Chad , and Joe in a barroom brawl . To impress Mr . Simon with their abilities , the Rangers set up a phony kidnapping and rescue operation , by the notorious " Davis Gang " . They don't know it , but dastardly gang leader Charles Gray ( as Tom Davis ) gets wind of the plan , and kidnaps the Senator , for real ! This episode has some good , colorful location and set scenes . The story set-up is very silly , but it ends with some excitement , and a good stunt . Laredo - A Matter of Policy ( / 65 ) R . G . Springsteen - Neville Brand , Peter Brown , William Smith
Sexiest of the Series	As Annette Funicello ( as Connie ) and the " Beach Party " gang strip into their bathing suits for a pool party , outer-worldly Tommy Kirk ( as Go Go ) dons a movie usher's uniform ; then , he is transported to Earth . Mr . Kirk's mission is to prepare Earth for an invasion of Martians . He is sent to dresser Elsa Lanchester ( as Aunt Wendy ) ' s home . Ms . Lanchester thinks young Kirk belongs on the beach . She renames him " George " , and sends him out , in tight blue trunks , to have fun in the sun . On the beach , Kirk meets Ms . Funicello , and romance ensues ? Not the best of the run , as it's missing some essentials ; but , American International's " Pajama Party " is probably the series ' sexiest entry . The cast is more often featured in swimwear than bedclothes , you should note . And , with the exception of Funicello , the cast is in their hottest beach attire . The exceptional Funicello shows off her assets in pink nightwear , during her " Stuffed Animal " song performance ; and , she gets a dance number , too . Probably due to scheduling conflicts , it appears Frankie Avalon's role was moved over to Jody McCrea ; and , Mr . Avalon appears in dubbed voice-over and cameo only . At one point , it's suggested that Kirk is borrowing Funicello boyfriend McCrea's clothes , which would have been believable with Avalon , but not the much larger McCrea . Other regulars get more to do , too , like Buster Keaton , Donna Loren , and Mike Nader . The cameos are way cool ; like " My name is Dorothy " Kilgallen as a fun motorcycle mama . While the Frankie / Annette dynamic is missing ; Kirk is a worthy substitute , and his meeting Funicello on the beach is a delight . Watch as Kirk explains how well-versed he is on Earth , mentioning , " George Washington , Abraham Lincoln , Mickey Mantle , Frankie Avalon ? " and , he tells Funicello , " You have a well-rounded ? " By the film's end , his unfinished phrase can be filled in . Pajama Party ( 1964 ) Don Weis - Tommy Kirk , Annette Funicello , Buster Keaton
Lucy Hits the Wall	" You're invited to party hearty - and in fabulous style - with this lavish 1974 screen version of the beloved Broadway musical . Lucille Ball brings star sparkle to the title role , a high-living grande dame who's outlandishly eccentric and , when suddenly faced with raising an orphaned nephew , fiercely loving . Veterans of the New York stage original join her : Beatrice Arthur as best friend ' Vera ' , Jane Connell as prim governess ' Agnes ' , choreographer Onna White , and director Gene Saks . As Mame's husband ' Beauregard ' , Robert Preston sings ' Loving You ' , written specially for the film . Jerry Herman's songs , from ' It's Today ' to ' We Need a Little Christmas ' to ' If He Walked Into My Life ' , rank among the best show tunes ever . For a grand time , bring home ' Mame ' , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . Let's try to be kind , since Lucy's " Mame " is all too obvious in its faults . After about an hour - if you can stay tuned ( if not , fast forward to the coach arrival of Ms . Ball and Mr . Preston at his southern plantation ) , the film gets better . Ball hilariously meets Preston's family while impersonating " Scarlet O'Hara " , goes fox-trotting on the horse " Lightning Rod " , and participates in the film's best musical production number . The choreography and performance of the title song " Mame " is breezy and breathtaking ; and , it serves as a sweet tribute to Ball , in her last feature film . These mid-movie sequences give the film a lift , and the next hour of the film is more enjoyable than the first . Still , there's no getting around the fact that the miscasting of Ball in the title role was a fatal flaw . Now , with Mae West as " Vera " and Desi Arnaz as " Beauregard " , it might have worked ? Mame ( / 74 ) Gene Saks - Lucille Ball , Bea Arthur , Robert Preston
Bad Sister	Boarding house sisters Clara Bow ( as Mayme Barry ) and Jean Arthur ( as Janie Barry ) both work as salesgirls in " Ginsberg's Department Store " . Ms . Bow is in love with dashing James Hall ( as William " Bill " Taylor ) . Conveniently , Mr . Hall rooms at the same boarding house , and also works at " Ginsberg's " . Her friends think Bow may give up her reputation as " The Saturday Night Kid " , and marry Hall . But , Ms . Arthur has other plans ; Bow's sneaky little sister " borrows " her underwear , perfume , money - - and , finally , her man . This sound re-make of " Love ' Em and Leave ' Em " puts Bow in the successful department store setting of " It " . The locale , and situations , really don't work ; but , the makeshift terrace party area looks great . Bow is fine as " Mayme " , but she might have been better than Arthur as " Janie " . Arthur's character is so transparent , and annoying , it's difficult to understand her extraordinary ability to deceive ; and , this version of the play leaves her character " unresolved " . Edna May Oliver ( as Miss Streeter ) makes an impressive sound debut , and Jean Harlow has a small role . The Saturday Night Kid ( 1929 ) A . Edward Sutherland - Clara Bow , Jean Arthur , James Hall
Blue Christmas	It's Christmas in a little French town . Carolers sing " O Holy Night " while toymaker Josef Swickard works in his shop . Outside , beautiful little waif Virginia Marshall begs in the snow , but mean adults push her down in the street . Mr . Swickard witnesses the cruelty , and takes Ms . Marshall in ; he warm her feet , with dry socks , in his shop . She dreams of " The March of the Wooden Soldiers " while he prepares a feast in " The Toy Shop " . Nice Technicolor photography by pioneer Ray Rennahan , especially in the atmospheric opening . A more historical than entertaining short film , however .
Like Mother , Like Son	Two of the family Stone wish to raise money . Donna ( Donna Reed ) wants $2 , 500 for the hospital committee ; and , Jeff ( Paul Peterson ) needs $33 , so that his " Bobcats " football team can buy a new tackling dummy . Donna tells Alex ( Carl Betz ) she wants to get concert pianist Roger Til ( as Anton Duval ) for a charity benefit . Donna doesn't know that the new girl in school , who has a crush on Jeff , is Mr . Duval's daughter , Reba Waters ( as Antoinette ) . When Til plays piano in the " rock ' n ' roll " style preferred by Mary ( Shelley Fabares ) , Donna calls it an " infernal racket . " To help his mother get into Til's good graces , Jeff succumbs to Waters , who he feels is , " pretty for a girl . " Dough Re-Mi ( / 58 ) Oscar Rudolph - Donna Reed , Paul Peterson , Roger Til
Richard Carle and Johnny Arthur Hold Sway	" People stranded in a country house during a storm discover that the home was the sight of an unsolved murder years before . During a dinner discussion of the incident , the lights go out and , when they come back on , they discover that one of the guests has been killed . Fearing for their lives , the guests attempt to find out the secrets behind the death before others can occur , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . There are a couple of clever twists in this murder at the " Old Dark House " story , with the " Play within a Play " being its most interesting feature . However , the direction is rather ordinary , which serves to highlight a certain cheapness of production . Like most movies of this type , there is ( or , should be ) an ensemble of intriguing characters . Herein , only old-time Broadway producer Richard Carle ( as Herman Wood ) and his fey secretary Johnny Arthur ( as Homer Erskine ) maintain interest . The Ghost Walks ( 1934 ) Frank R . Strayer - Richard Carle , Johnny Arthur , John Miljan
Little Gladys Bridges the Gap	During the Civil War , there were many cases of divided loyalties ; obviously , many occurred " In the Border States " , where North met South by happenstance of geography . From the border , young father Owen Moore goes off to join the Union Army . Shortly , Confederate soldier Henry B . Walthall , separated from his regimen , wanders onto the enemy's property , desperate for water ; he finds a supply where the Unionist's young daughter Gladys Egan sits . When the Yankee soldiers track him down , Little Gladys innocently helps the Confederate hide . Later , when he returns to kill her father , the little girl's kindness is remembered . A sweet , small story from director D . W . Griffith . Location footage and humanity are lovingly displayed .
Way Out West with the Stooges	The Three Stooges in a feature length western comedy-musical ? Perhaps " Rockin ' in the Rockies " was meant to combine the Stooges comedy short with the western musical , in a matinée ; if so , this was a pleasant way to break up a Saturday afternoon . Jay Kirby ( as Rusty ) is a handsome young hero ; and , Marty Beth Hughes ( as the blonde June ) and Gladys Blake ( as the brunette Betty ) are pretty women . The Hoosier Hotshots are a harmonious group ; their songs are quite tuneful ; however , this is the 1940s , not the 1950s , so the film doesn't exactly " rock " . There are a few laughs ; but the Stooges ' brand of humor is more subdued than usual . The talking horse is also underutilized . Rockin ' in the Rockies ( 1945 ) Vernon Keays - Moe Howard , Larry Fine , Curly Howard
You Don't Win Silver , You Lose Gold	Three college roommates would die to attend grad school at Harvard - but , their grades are wack . " It's either an MBA from Harvard or you're flipping burgers . " So , after some partying , two of them decide to kill the third , and make it look like a suicide . The reason being the " standard practice " of giving traumatized roommates of suicide victims an automatic 4 . 0 grade point average for the semester . The three dudes are : psycho Matthew Lillard ( as Tim ) , impotent Michael Vartan ( as Chris ) , and contemptible Randall Batinkoff ( as Rand ) . Their pretty blonde girlfriends , fickle Keri Russell ( as Emma ) and possibly pregnant Tamara Craig Thomas ( as Natalie ) , are also roommates . Debuting director Dan Rosen's " Dead Man's Curve " characters definitely need a college shrink ; and , this is the job filled by nicotine-addicted Dana Delany ( as Dr . Ashley ) . The story , especially during the last act , needs some doctoring , too . Re-titled " The Curve " , it has noting to do with the Jan & Dean's death drag classic played over the closing credits . Dead Man's Curve ( 1998 ) Dan Rosen - Matthew Lillard , Michael Vartan , Randall Batinkoff
Spare the Tod and Slaughter the Child	" An unscrupulous squire plots to have a young woman for his own by framing her fiancé for a crime . The young man heads off to the gold fields of Australia to seek his fortune , while the squire stops any mail from being sent or received by the couple through his hold over the postmaster . The squire even has the young man's best friend imprisoned to prevent the friend from discovering what the squire is doing , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . The best part of this uneven story is savoring master Tod Slaughter as prison warden ( or , " Justice of the Peace " ) . " This jail is my hobby . I regard the prisoners here as my children , naughty children it is true , who have to be punished , " Slaughter explains , " It hurts me more than it hurts them . " Several others , like Jack Livesey ( as Tom Robinson ) , make the prison scenes interesting . But , young John Singer ( as Matthew Joseph ) is the film's Achilles ' heel - he's a " naughty " child who really doesn't deserve to be Slaughtered . It's Never Too Late to Mend ( 1937 ) David MacDonald - Tod Slaughter , Jack Livesey , John Singer
Ronald Reagan Steps Lightly	Investigative reporter Ronald Reagan ( as Matt Sawyer ) is at odds with his editor , and may lose his job permanently if he's wrong about a big story with dangerous gangster connections . Mr . Reagan thinks a millionaire was murdered , but officials say suicide . The dead man's daughter , pretty Joan Perry ( as Jane Abbott ) , comes to agree with Reagan ; and , the two are mutually attracted . He is finally fired , for getting the story wrong , but more murders may prove Reagan right , after all ? Reagan , who doesn't always dominate the films he is advertised as the " star " of , really lives up to his top billing , this time around . A . Edward Sutherland's " Nine Lives Are Not Enough " is an intermittently bright and funny comic murder mystery , with Reagan showing promise as a light comic ; he is the movie's main asset , maintaining interest throughout an unfortunately fair feature . After this appearance , Ms . Perry took herself out of cinema circulation , for marriage with Harry Cohn . Nine Lives Are Not Enough ( 1941 ) A . Edward Sutherland - Ronald Reagan , Joan Perry , James Gleason
Long with the Wind	This very long sequel to " Gone with the Wind " is an EPIC disappointment . What the storyline is will vary from viewer to viewer - my take is that it started with the funeral of " Melanie Hamilton " ( unseen ) , proceeded with the death of " Mammy " ( Esther Rolle ) , and meandered around until " Scarlett O'Hara " ( Joanne Whalley ) found her " Roots " . She does this by going to Ireland , and stands in some Stonehenge type rubble , which is the original " Tara " . If you don't know what " Tara " is , you probably shouldn't be watching this one . As in Margaret Mitchell's original story , " Rhett Butler " ( Timothy Dalton ) pops in and out of Scarlett's life . Neither Ms . Whalley nor Mr . Dalton are very impressive , and the script doesn't help them very much ; since the " Rhett " character is ( and always was ) more secondary , Whalley fares worse . In lesser roles , other actors have good moments . Probably , the best performance arrives later in the running time - with Sean Bean's wicked " Lord Richard Fenton " . When Mr . Bean takes the screen , he TAKES the screen - he will wake you up . " Fenton " is purely evil , and may not belong in Margaret Mitchell's cast of characters , but at least Bean brings some passion to the proceedings . The original book and film were full of PASSION , and this follow-up has so very little ? The sets , costumes , and locations are extremely beautiful , though ? Scarlett ( - ) John Erman - Joanne Whalley , Timothy Dalton , Sean Bean
Hey , Hey ! They're the Monkees - Can You Dig It ?	Micky Dolenz , Davy Jones , Peter Tork , and Mike Nesmith star as the " The Monkees " , a manufactured pop / rock group trapped in commercialism . Albeit with some serious lapses in development , this film follows the same characterizations offered in the TV series " The Monkees " . Bob Rafelson and The Monkees continue with themes and surrealistic elements used in the TV show . Interestingly , " Head " closely follows the television series ' finial episodes , which are a primer for their " career-ending " film . New pal Jack Nicholson , coming off " Psych-Out " , jumps aboard The Monkees ' ship , for its final visual trip . This is a surprisingly well-structured film , given my expectations . The Monkees are trapped in " The Box " ( television ) ; despite some valiant attempts , they are unable to break free . The ending , if you're able to focus , does cohesively wrap-up the seemingly ( but not , really ) disjointed events . You'll need to watch the closing scenes carefully , to pick up the references to earlier sequences . My favorite is Mr . Dolenz discovering an empty Coca-Cola machine in the dessert ; later , it will be shot to pieces . Also enjoyable are Mr . Tork's scenes with the transvestite waiter . Tork's acting performance ( if that even matters ) is good ; he always does well in the more psychedelic Monkey situations . ( Imagine Tork playing in this film with Charlie Chaplin , Buster Keaton , and Groucho Marx ! ) Annette Funicello is terrific in a small supporting role , and Frank Zappa enjoyable in a cameo . The problem with " Head " is that it does not celebrate the emerging individual personalities of the Monkees as a replacement for their imprisoned group persona . Nor does it display much of the humorous camaraderie which made the actors ' TV show so much fun . It lacks respect . Probably , at the time , no one recognized that this was either necessary , or could be done . Head ( 1968 ) Bob Rafelson - Micky Dolenz , Peter Tork , Davy Jones
Gotham City Mugging	After Leo Gorcey ( as Muggs McGinnis ) laments the rise of muggings in the city , " The East Side Kids " admit Al Stone ( as Herbie ) , a cousin of Huntz Hall ( as Glimpy McClosky ) , into the club . They join mates William " Billy " Benedict ( as Skinny ) , David " Dave " Durand ( as Dave aka Danny ) , Bobby Stone ( as Rocky ) , Jimmy Strand ( as Lou aka Pinkie ) , and Buddy " Bud " Gorman ( as Stinkie aka Slug ) to save millionaire Herbert Hayes ( as John H . Cortland ) from a mugging . Befriending the grateful Mr . Hayes , Gorcey and the Kids discover the wealthy man's young son is a closeted juvenile delinquent . For kicks , Johnny Duncan ( as Roy Cortland ) aka the " Million Dollar Kid " hangs out in pool halls with derelicts like Gabriel Dell ( as Lefty ) . Moreover , young Duncan's pretty sister , Louise Currie ( as Louise Cortland ) , may be engaged to a gangster . Out of respect and admiration for the older millionaire , Gorcey and pals decide they must reform young Duncan , and investigate his sister's French fiancé . This one is predictable , but fun . The subtle , satirical humor works very well - it starts with Gorcey quizzing club applicant " Herbie " about his age ( obviously more than two times 14 years old ) and reaches a peak as Gorcey has a great " bit " with his ( real ) father , playing a short messenger with a chip on his shoulder . It's also nice to see Duncan featured ; he becomes an official " East Side Kid " herein , and will play " Robin " in the 1949 " Batman " series . Million Dollar Kid ( / 44 ) Wallace Fox - Leo Gorcey , Huntz Hall , Johnny Duncan
Triple Fizzle	The three stars - Frank Sinatra , Jane Russell , and Groucho Marx - make the film interesting and enjoyable ( if you like them ) . Everything else seems routine . At one point , when Mr . Marx is discovered smoking a cigar in Mr . Sinatra's bathtub , the movie threatens to become surreal . This scene could not have happened in this movie ; it violates the structure of the film up to that point . . . but , if the film had stayed with that " possible - only - in - a - Marx - Brothers " situation , it might have become something other than routine . And , of course , I can't pass up a " Merry XMas , Groucho ! " ( . . . which I didn't catch Ms . Russell or Mr . Sinatra wishing ! ) Hey , it would have made me laugh . Double Dynamite ( 1951 ) Irving Cummings - Frank Sinatra , Jane Russell , Groucho Marx
Kidding Around with Charles Laughton	In the late 1600s , dastardly pirate Charles Laughton ( as Captain William Kidd ) convinces King William III ( Henry Daniell ) he's above board - but , of course , Mr . Laughton is pulling the King's leg . One of the Captain's seafaring crew of cutthroats , heroic Randolph Scott ( as Adam Mercy ) , poses a threat . Laughton killed Mr . Scott's father , and soon adds the father of beautiful-on-board Barbara Britton ( as Lady Anne Dunstan ) to his list of victims . Scott falls for the fetching Ms . Britton . Entertaining as always , Laughton makes the most of his role . Scott seems like a fish out of water ; and , to varying degrees , so do many in the cast . The interesting crew features " first mate " performances from Reginald Owen ( as Shadwell ) and John Carradine ( as Povey ) . Smaller roles essayed by Gilbert Roland ( as Lorenzo ) and William Farnum ( as Captain Rawson ) are equally satisfying . Alas , the production is rushed and unsatisfying , despite an " Oscar " - nominated score , by Werner Janssen . Captain Kidd ( / 45 ) Rowland V . Lee - Charles Laughton , Randolph Scott , Barbara Britton
A Slow Moving Lion in Winter	Robert Mitchum ( as Curt ) stars as bullying , titular head of the arguing Bridges family , electing himself over both parents , and brothers Tab Hunter ( as Hal ) and William Hopper ( as Arthur ) . In the dead of winter , the family is threatened by a marauding mountain lion ; the animal must be destroyed before it eats the Bridges family . Carl " Alfalfa " Switzer ( as " Chief " Joe Sam ) is the Bridges ' ranchhand ; the mountain lion killed his entire family some years ago . This is an exceedingly slow-moving and pretentiously written " psychological drama " . The direction ( William A . Wellman ) and photography ( William H . Clothier ) might be its most interesting feature . The Bridges ' home is decorated in blacks and whites , but shot in color ; this highlights the actors ' complexions , and an occasional symbolic item , like Mr . Mitchum's red jacket . Due to the " black and white in color " gimmick , or in spite of it , the film looks beautiful . But nothing can MOVE the " Track of the Cat " story , making the the film merely an interesting experiment . Beulah Bondi ( as Ma ) and Teresa Wright ( as sister Grace ) might fascinate fans . Surprisingly , Tab Hunter offers the film's leading performance ; emerging as the film's focus . Track of the Cat ( / 54 ) William A . Wellman - Robert Mitchum , Tab Hunter , Teresa Wright
The 8th Voyage of Sinbad	Douglas Fairbanks Jr . ( as Sinbad ) loves to tell stories , like this one . After a ship's crew is poisoned , Mr . Fairbanks Jr . ' s " Sinbad the Sailor " hops on board and finds a map to Deryabar ; there , he hopes to find the treasure of Alexander the Great . He also believes he may be the rightful Prince of Deryabar . A greedy couple - the alluring Maureen O'Hara ( as Shireen ) and her turbaned partner Anthony Quinn ( as Emir ) get in the way ? Colorful lethargy . The stars are much more interesting in other films , although Fairbanks Jr . is somehow engaging ; at least , he tries not to look completely bored . The story lacks both focus and humor , and it is way too long . Walter Slezak as " Melik the Hairdresser " is THE performance to keep your eyes on , if you watch ; he is delicious . . . Sinbad the Sailor ( 1947 ) Richard Wallace - Douglas Fairbanks Jr . , Walter Slezak , Maureen O'Hara
The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down	Idealistic attorney Chris O'Donnell ( as Adam Hall ) goes down to Mississippi , to take on the " death row clemency case of his onetime Klansman grandfather " Gene Hackman ( as Sam Cayhall ) . " With just 28 days before the execution , Adam sets out to retrace the events leading to the crime for which Sam was convicted . As the impending death sentence looms closer , Adam works quickly to uncover the family's history for any hidden clues . In a white-knuckle series of twists and turns , Adam discovers deceptions and dark secrets that ultimately lead him to the startling truth , " according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis . " White-knuckled " ? Indeed not . " The Chamber " ( as in gas chamber ) starts off very well ; and , Mr . Hackman's portrayal of the yellow-teethed racist is worth a look . Faye Dunaway ( as Lee Cayhall Bowman ) has a showy supporting role . All in all , the film's personnel portends a much better story than the one which appears on screen . Building up a romance between blue-eyed Mr . O'Donnell and brown-skinned Lela Rochon ( as Nora Stark ) seems like such an obvious way to improve the story ( whether or not it was done in the John Grisham novel ) , you've got to wonder how on Earth they missed the obvious . The Chamber ( 1996 ) James Foley - Chris O'Donnell , Gene Hackman , Faye Dunaway
Joan Staley Turns on the Charm	Chad ( Peter Brown ) returns early from a case , in his long underwear ; as it turns out , he's been ambushed by outlaw prisoner Billy Harker's sexy girlfriend Joan Staley ( as Laurie Martin ) . Parmalee ( Philip Carey ) sends Reese ( Neville Brand ) and Joe ( William Smith ) out to assist the slightly embarrassed Chad , and salvage the mission . Pretty-in-pink Ms . Staley proves to be a formidable feminine obstacle , during the search for her outlaw boyfriend Billy . Skin watchers should note that studly Chad and hunky Smith perform their opening scenes shirtless . And , later on , " Playboy Playmate " Staley gets to show her bare shoulders and legs while dressing ( behind a conveniently large tree , however ) . This episode features a very enjoyable guest performance , by Staley . She and Mr . Brown perform their " re-encounter " scene exceptionally well . " Anybody Here Seen Billy ? " is very nicely directed , by non-appearing actor Lawrence Dobkin ; and , Andrew Jackson's color photography is just right . Finally , Mr . Smith , unmoved by Staley's wiles , gets to orchestrate an exciting conclusion . Laredo - Anybody Here Seen Billy ? ( / 65 ) Lawrence Dobkin - Peter Brown , Joan Staley , Neville Brand
Lost in the Translation	" In one of the hidden corridors of power at United Nations headquarters , translator Silvia Broome ( Nicole Kidman ) overhears a potentially explosive secret about a planned assassination attempt . But when federal agent Tobin Keller ( Sean Penn ) investigates her claim and digs deeper into Silvia's dangerous past , he begins to question whether she is a victim - or a suspect ? " Notable for being filmed inside the elusive United Nations building , and for being its famed director's last feature film . Catherine Keener ( as Dot Woods ) manages to make her sadly underdeveloped character more interesting than the leads . " The Interpreter " is well-produced , with a highlighted bus ride . And , it does answer the question : How could a Sydney Pollack film , shot on location in New York , with Sean Penn , be dull ?

A Simple Twist of Fate	As a little boy , Jude Law ( as Danny Kowalski ) , helped deliver a baby . Because his hand was small , young " Danny " ( Cory Buck ) was able to reach in , and uncurl the umbilical cord from around the neck of the baby . So , the baby girl is born healthy ; and , the little boy , who will grow up to be Jude Law , declares , " I'm gonna marry her . " Twenty-five years later , Law returns to Los Angeles , from an education in London . He loses his girlfriend , and has trouble finding employment ; he's a tile artist . Then , while delivering a cake , he returns to the house where he long ago delivered the baby ; she has grown into beautiful Gretchen Mol ( as Anna Swan ) . Law falls madly in love with Ms . Mol , and wants to fulfill his childhood pledge to marry her ; but , she is pledged to another man . Swan family matriarch Brenda Blethyn ( as Grace Swan ) enables womb-reaching Law to become a employee / companion to the family ; but , despite his close quarters , he finds Mol a tough love-nut to crack . Law is a very likable leading man , but his romantic interest in , and rapport with , Mol is nil . He might have been better off considering Martha Plimpton ( as Karen Swan ) . The most entertaining relationship occurs between blind sister Jennifer Tilly ( as Nina Swan ) and Spanish savior Vincent Laresca ( as Jesus ) . By the way , they meet in a nightclub where males are stabbed for refusing accept an invitation to dance ; still , the place is crowded . Director / writer Charlie Peters includes many references to Tolstoy's " Anna Karenina " . Julian Lennon's " Day After Day " leads off a sweet soundtrack . In short , the leading relationship would have been more interesting with Ms . Plimpton as " Anna " . Ms . Blethyn and Mr . Laresca contribute strong supporting characterizations .

Carole Lombard is Colored	Small-town Carole Lombard ( as Hazel Flagg ) is mistakenly diagnosed with radiation poisoning , which draws the attention of an enterprising " New York Star " reporter Fredric March ( as Wally Cook ) . Although the two ( separately ) realize drunken bumpkin doctor Charles Winninger's diagnosis is in error , they go along with the ruse . Ms . Lombard wants to leave Vermont , the land of " yup " and " nope " , for the excitement of New York City ; and , Mr . March wants to make Lombard's sob story a media sensation . Wanna bet the two fall in love ? " Nothing Sacred " offers a great cast and crew ; some of it is exceptionally well-written ( Ben Hecht is sharply observant ) , but this film has not aged well . Most obviously , its heavy-handed racist and stereotypical characterizations are more annoying than endearing . Classic " screwball " comedies looked better in " black & white " ; and , while it's certainly a welcome variation , the Technicolor seems out of place . Is nothing scared ? Lombard , usually considered an actress to photograph in " black & white " , took a role thought of as for Janet Gaynor , who had just showed she looked great in color ( " A Star Is Born " ) . In " Nothing Scared " , Lombard is photographed well most of the time , but not always . Certainly , she performs the part exceptionally , however . Behind the scenes , director William Wellman maneuvers the color cameras with style . The supporting cast is illustrious . Nothing Sacred ( 1937 ) William A . Wellman - Carole Lombard , Fredric March , Walter Connolly
Julie Do Ya Love Me ?	This film should have been better , with Doris Day and Louis Jourdan showing promise as the " terrified wife on the run from deranged husband . " I did not care for the gasping , breathless , overly dramatic voiceovers from Ms . Day - I can't believe they asked her to do these ; they spoil the dramatic acting performance on the visible screen . Mr . Jourdan is fun as the psycho husband , but he is give some silly stalking things to do - like , he sets off a tape recorder of his manic piano playing in a car outside Ms . Day's window ? Imagine what Alfred Hitchcock would have given Jourdan and Day to do ! The ending doesn't work for me - I would have liked , instead , a suspenseful confrontation between Day and Jourdan to end the film ; perhaps , with them alone in the cockpit - having a dramatic confrontation while the fate of the airplane's passengers hangs in the balance ! Julie ( 1956 ) Andrew L . Stone - Doris Day , Louis Jourdan , Barry Sullivan
Paradise Costs	Bangkok-bound Leonardo DiCaprio ( as Richard ) drinks six beers during his airplane flight . After landing , the adventure-seeking Mr . DiCaprio drinks snake blood , as a chaser . Then , " Daffy " acquaintance Robert Carlyle meets an unexpected , bloody demise , leaving DiCaprio a map , which is supposed to lead him to a secret island paradise . DiCaprio invites a sexually active young French couple , Virginie Ledoyen ( Françoise ) and Guillaume Canet ( Etienne ) , to accompany him . They find Carlyle's map leads to " The Beach " , a community of " beautiful people " in eternal vacation mode . Soon , DiCaprio finds his life complicated by affairs with the feminine half of his invited twosome , and the older woman who manages the island community , lady dictator Tilda Swinton ( as " Sal " ) . Danny Boyle's " The Beach " spends its first half being pretty , but vacuous . After a graphic shark attack , it turns more bloody , but only slightly less vacuous . The Beach ( 2000 ) Danny Boyle - Leonardo DiCaprio , Virginie Ledoyen , Tilda Swinton
Bonita Granville Suspects Fowl Play	The " Brinwood School for Young Ladies " is buzzing about the arrival of wealthy sponsor Helena Phillips Evans ( as Mary Eldredge ) . Pretty teenage sleuth Bonita Granville ( as Nancy Drew ) and the girls hope the woman's offer of $250 , 000 will be used to install a swimming pool . When the elderly woman disappears just before making the donation , Ms . Granville suspects foul play . Her father , lawyer John Litel ( as Carson Drew ) , and others try to veer Granville of the case ; but , she is determined to find the missing woman . Granville enlists help from young wavy-haired neighbor Frankie Thomas ( as Ted Nickerson ) . The " Carolyn Keene " characters were unfamiliar to this commenter , but this certainly seems like a satisfactory adaptation . Granville , who made an impression in " These Three " ( 1936 ) , is an attractive , determined , intelligent , and charming heroine . Unlike most early " teen " stars , Granville appears natural and endearing , even with expressions like " I'll bet you $23 . 80 " and " I should say not ! " Mr . Thomas , who made an impression in " Wednesday's Child " ( 1934 ) , is similarly appealing and unaffected , for a 1930s movie juvenile . Thomas says " Let's keep it clean " and makes the " drag " scene . " Nancy Drew - Detective " shows how well a " small " genre film can be done . Granville and Thomas make a cute team . Nancy Drew - Detective ( 1938 ) William Clemens - Bonita Granville , Frankie Thomas , John Litel
The Huntress Gets Captured by The Game	Ruth Chatterton ( as Alison Drake ) is the successful president of " Drake Motors " ; she runs a tight ship , and has a yen for good-looking men . In fact , she enjoys treating men they way they have always treated women ; and , attractive new hires are invited to Ms . Chatterton's mansion for an evening of vodka and sex . When invitees get out of line , or expect more than a " one night stand " , Chatterton has them transferred . The boss woman goes unsatisfied when evening " pick up " George Brent ( as Jim Thorne ) turns her down . When she discovers Mr . Brent is a new hire at her company , Chatterton again tries , and fails , to seduce him . Has Chatterton finally met her match ? " Female " looks most like a William A . Wellman film , but boasts three directors ; and , here's how ( more or less ) : The film's director was William Dieterle ; then , he became ill . So , the film was directed ( mostly ) by Mr . Wellman . However , Jack Warner was unhappy with George Blackwood's performance ( as Cooper ) . The studio ordered the scenes with Mr . Blackwood re-shot . Then , Michael Curtiz directed ( only ) the scenes with Blackwood's replacement , Johnny Mack Brown ( as Cooper ) . Still , the completed film was to credit Wellman ( rightly ) . But , Wellman and Warner Brothers terminated their relationship ( unhappily ) . So , the studio credited Mr . Curtiz . With whomever directing , Chatterton is terrific ; sadly , her efforts are ruined by an ending which is almost repulsive - - what this film does to Chatterton's character is criminal . Still , " Female " is well worth watching , mainly for Chatterton's great style , and performance . Brent ( her off-screen husband , at the time ) is at his very best , too . And , the supporting cast is great fun . For example , Ferdinand Gottschalk ( as Pettigrew ) amuses in the workplace ; and , don't miss Rafaela Ottiano ( as Della ) getting a swat in the derrière ! Note Ms . Ottiano was Greta Garbo's maid in " Grand Hotel " ( 1932 ) ; incidentally , Garbo used the name " Harriet Brown " ( Lois Wilson's character ) , and the soon divorced leading man George Brent , from this film . Small world .
Smoking in the Girls Room	Rosalind Russell is the Mother Superior of a Catholic school invaded by troubled young women Hayley Mills ( she's Mary ) and her cohort June Harding ( she's Rachel ) . Ms . Mills and Ms . Harding don't want to be in the stuffy convent school ; predictably , they become the resident Juvenile Delinquents . Can Mother Superior turn their lives around ? The story is very weak . For 1966 , you wonder what all the fuss was about . The girls smoke in the bathroom and boiler room ( which is mistaken for a fire ) . When the girls mention idols Jack Lemmon and Kim Novak , you know the screenplay was not even made contemporary to 1966 ( originally , the story took place several decades earlier ) . AND , can you believe a Mother superior plucking and painting her eyebrows quite like Ms . Russell ? BUT , the movie works . The strength of the players carries you along . Mills and Harding could be smoking pot - - it doesn't matter ; the message is relayed . Russell's reaction to the girls ' band uniforms works for the same reason ; the uniforms are not shocking , but you know how Russell feels ( note director Ida Lupino's close-up during this scene ) . The strength of the performances make " The Trouble with Angels " more successful than it looks on paper . The theme / ending is VERY predictable ; but , note that Mother Superior also changes - - by the " cocktail dress " scene , her character has become more like her unmanageable twosome . The Trouble with Angels ( 1966 ) Ida Lupino - Rosalind Russell , Hayley Mills , June Harding
The Queen of Denial	Beautifully busted Elizabeth Taylor ( as Cleopatra ) copulates with seething lover Richard Burton ( as Mark Antony ) , after godly lover Rex Harrison ( as Julius Caesar ) becomes indisposed . The threesome do not perform their best work ; and , neither of the men pair very memorably with Ms . Taylor . Off screen , Taylor and Mr . Burton were lovers - but , that " chemistry " doesn't show . Taylor had proved herself a worthy actress up until " Cleopatra " - but , in this role , she faltered . Most of the time , she is modeling rather than acting . In fact , Taylor was beyond this role ( which should have been offered to someone like Sophia Loren ) ; but , the money was good ? Despite all that , the film is incredibly gorgeous . The reputation of " Cleopatra " as either a flop or failure isn't entirely true . Its flaws are obvious , but so are its strengths . The " Academy Awards " for cinematography , sets , costumes , and special effects are earned ( more or less ) . Roddy McDowall ( as Octavian ) should have received a " Best Supporting Actor " nomination , also . Writer / director Joseph L . Mankiewicz and crew do not create an extraordinary finished product ; but , there are individual scenes and sequences of great beauty . The direction and photography help make the film's running time more tolerable . Better than its reputation , and marginally recommended . Cleopatra ( 1963 ) Joseph L . Mankiewicz - Elizabeth Taylor , Richard Burton , Rex Harrison
On the Road Again	James Dean says this " play is the story of a young man named Jeffery Latham , who opened the door of a very ordinary , innocent-looking roadside diner , and he saw his whole life change ? " Mr . Dean ( as Latham ) plays a restless young man from Wisconsin , who has just ended his stint in Korea . With little luck hitchhiking after dark , Dean enters the diner , and orders coffee and a sandwich . Dean goes behind the counter to fix proprietor Murvyn Vye ( as Mike Deegan ) ' s broken coffee pot , revealing he's worked in diners . Mr . Vye needs help in the coffee shop , and offers Dean a job , and a room . With no place to go , Dean happily accepts . While tending tables , Dean meets pretty Pat Hardy ( as Ann Burnett ) , who becomes his girlfriend ( Hardy was a real-life friend of Dean ) . Dean feels his restless drifting may have ended , with a stable job , and relationship . After a date with Ms . Hardy , Dean overhears a conversation revealing his trusted benefactor is involved with local crime lord Edgar Stehli ( as Matt Schreiber ) . Though disillusioned , Dean stays in town , intending to avoid criminal activity . Mr . Stehli and Vye , however , have other plans . Vye tricks Dean into transporting some stolen goods ; and , while driving on an " unlighted road " , Dean's car draws gunfire . Dean's speedy attempt to get away causes the other car to swerve out of control , and crash . Racing back to the diner , Dean learns the other driver , a state trooper , has died . Now a " cop killer " , Dean must choose to work for gangster Stehli , or turn himself over to the police . . . Appearing after the premiere of " East of Eden " , this short drama was no great shakes , relatively speaking . Still , " The Unlighted Road " is a neat little play . Writer Walter C . Brown , Dean , and the cast perform admirably . With Brown's script , Dean is able create a sympathetic character . And , it's nice to see Dean , newly a big screen " movie star " , still appearing in an occasional small screen drama . The Unlighted Road ( / 55 ) Justus Addiss - James Dean , Murvyn Vye , Pat Hardy
Geraldine Farrar Hits the Screen as Carmen	Geraldine Farrar ( as Carmen ) is a Gypsy involved with a gang of smugglers ; to help them , she agrees to deflect Officer Wallace Reid ( as Don Jose ) ' s attention with a seduction . Mr . Reid is so smitten with Ms . Farrar , he decides to pursue her ; but Farrar only has eyes for bullfighter Pedro de Cordoba ( as Escamillo ) ? Farrar , with a flower in her teeth , is unintentionally amusing ( and not very convincing to modern eyes ) as a seductress . Nonetheless , she was a big Metropolitan Opera star , and Bizet's " Carmen " proved to be a popular film debut . In fact , Motion Picture Magazine conducted an extensive poll to determine " Screen Masterpieces of Acting " . and Farrar's " Carmen " was the best female performance of the year 1915 ; she outpolled not only Mae Marsh ( in " Birth of a Nation " ) and Mary Pickford ( in " Rags " ) , but also Theda Bara in a competing version of " Carmen " . A movie highlight is Farrar letting her hair down and cat-fighting with another woman in the cigarette factory where they work - and almost ripping the other woman's shirt off ! Reid is a very handsome leading man , who doesn't overact throughout ; making a scene where he nearly rapes Farrar more convincing . Mr . de Cordoba always uses his eyes to great advantage . Cecil B . DeMille shows improvement as a director - near the end , Farrar and de Cordoba play a nicely staged scene before the bullfight ; though , Farrar ruins it by approaching the camera like she's going to take a bow . After the bullfight , Reid and Farrar take more " affective " bows . Carmen ( / 15 ) Cecil B . DeMille - Geraldine Farrar , Wallace Reid , Pedro de Cordoba
Soothing the Savage Beast	Or : " How the mind of an unfortunate was brought to reason by music . " The unfortunates subtitled are the mentally ill , who are taken care of in a nice-looking insane asylum . Claire McDowell ( a Nurse ) and Lionel Barrymore ( a Doctor ) work at the asylum ; they fall in love , and get married . Later , inmate Charles Hill Mailes ( a Lunatic ) loses it , cops a gun from Alfred Paget ( a Guard ) , and escapes . Mr . Hill Mailes is not without a redeeming quality , however ; he enjoys music , played on piano by nurses McDowell and Lillian Gish ( another Nurse ) . Director D . W . Griffith's storytelling strengths make " The House of Darkness " quite an enjoyable early film . The House of Darkness ( 1913 ) D . W . Griffith - Charles Hill Mailes , Claire McDowell , Lionel Barrymore
Robert Wagner knocks Joanne Woodward up for Oswald & Levin	Handsome college student Robert Wagner ( as Bud Corliss ) gets his heiress fiancée , Joanne Woodward ( as Dorothy " Dorrie " Kingship ) , " in trouble " . Unfortunately , this means Mr . Wagner can't marry the two months pregnant Ms . Woodward - because her savvy father George Macready ( as Leo Kingship ) frowns on sex before marriage . Wagner realizes he will have to drop out of school , and support his disinherited love child , unless he can come up with another solution ? When Woodward gets up unscathed , after her fall on the bleachers , it's almost like you're watching a cartoon . She suffers nary a scratch , and is too stupid to ask why Wagner expressed so little concern . Still , it's fun to watch 25-year-old Wagner try to get away with it ; his is a cool , subliminal performance . And , just when you thought the film couldn't get any better looking , Jeffrey Hunter ( as Gordon Grant ) and Virginia Leith ( as Ellen Kingship ) enter the storyline . Director Gerd Oswald gets in some good Hitchcock-like licks ; and , Mary Astor ( as mother Corliss ) dresses up well . A Kiss Before Dying ( 1956 ) Gerd Oswald - Robert Wagner , Joanne Woodward , Virginia Leith
White Men Can't Jump	In a western cave , white William S . Hart ( as Black Deering ) , leader of the outlaw Raiders , feels the law crashing in on his gang's crime spree . Fellow bandit Joseph Singleton ( as Tom Jordan ) thinks Mr . Hart is chicken , and goads his rival and the gang into one more heist . Of course , as Hart feared , things go all wrong . Later , on the lam from both Jordan and the law , Hart hides out with lonely white Anna Q . Nilsson ( as Mary Brown ) . Ms . Nilsson is living alone with son Richard Headrick ( as " The Little Feller " ) , since the disappearance of her husband ? " The Toll Gate " delivers the expected Hart western elements ; however , they do not coalesce . It's a little unpleasant to start off with Hart disarmed by his gang's " mutiny " , but nice to see him tough it out . Watch for a pivotal scene wherein Hart opens Nilsson's Bible : in it , he reads the verse " By their fruits ye shall know them " and locates a photograph which reveals something important about the film . The " by their fruits " theme is completely illogical if you think about the photograph . Also , Hart's cabin revelation is rather foolishly timed ; obviously , it should have been made some minutes later ( relating it more to Singleton's threat ) . The Toll Gate ( / 20 ) Lambert Hillyer - William S . Hart , Anna Q . Nilsson , Joseph Singleton
Kate Is Enough	Three married couples set off on a contest winning cruise . They are : Richard Long and Polly Bergen ( as Jerry and Sylvia Carter ) , Edward Albert and Kate Jackson ( as Jimmy and Mary Frances Radney ) , and Tom Bosley and Celeste Holm ( as David and Elizabeth Mason ) . On ship , they discover why nobody can really remember entering the contest ; it's a scam . A mysterious group known as " E & M Productions " has lured the six " winners " on board to kill them . As the travelers meet unfortunate ends , Michael Constantine ( as Dr . Burke ) assumes the role of investigator . Cesare Danova is the ship's captain . All are delightful . This is an unexpectedly suspenseful Spelling-Goldberg television production , with excellent performances and direction ( Ralph Senensky ) . And , it's very well paced . As they are being killed off , the three " happy " couples are revealed to be in significantly troubled marriages ; this , and a resemblance to ABC-TV's later " The Love Boat " series , gives the movie a heightened eeriness . Jack B . Sowards ' script has a few surprises ; and , most of the time , it is challenging to guess which passenger to will die next . Unfortunately , part of an ending explanation does not match a prior character motivation ; it's not enough to spoil the movie , however . This was Richard Long's last role , sadly ; the former " Big Valley " star died of a heart attack late in 1974 . Also , around this time , beautiful young co-stars Kate Jackson and Edward Albert were a real life couple ; although , they were " living in sin " ( unmarried ) . The relatively under-appreciated " TV performer " cast makes " Death Cruise " an enjoyable trip . Death Cruise ( / 74 ) Ralph Senensky - Richard Long , Kate Jackson , Michael Constantine
Elmer Clifton's Fantastic Voyage	" They that go down to the sea in ships , that do business in great waters ; these see the works of the Lord ; and his wonders in the deep . " - - Psalm 107 In the whaling town of New Bedford , Massachusetts , pretty Marguerite Courtot ( as Patience Morgan ) plays with her dolls ; an adult , she longs for her girlhood days with " the boy next door " . Happily , her objectification , Raymond McKee ( as Thomas Allan Dexter ) , returns , after some years in college . Soon , Mr . McKee opens a mill , and begins to court Ms . Courtot . McKee asks her father William Walcott ( as William Morgan ) for Courtot's hand in marriage . But Walcott , a strict Quaker , won't allow his obedient daughter to marry outside her religion . McKee offers to convert , but finds another challenge almost insurmountable : " Patience is a whaleman's daughter , " Walcott explains , " Unless thee has thrown a harpoon into a whale , take thy story of love elsewhere . It can never be - - never ! " So , McKee goes directly to the next whaling ship , hoping to harpoon a whale ; instead , he is abducted , and put to work aboard . Mixing it up in the waling ship is mischievous stowaway Clara Bow ( as Dot Morgan ) , Walcott's grand-daughter ; she has an eye for cabin boy James Turfler ( as Jimmy ) . Meanwhile , Patrick Hartigan ( as Jake Finner ) and Jack Baston ( as Samuel Siggs ) are plotting to steal both Walcott's ship , and his daughter's virtue ? The main story , and performances of the principals are thoroughly unconvincing ; although McKee does well whaling , while Courtot , the film's feminine lead , sits at home playing with her dolls . There are disturbing religious and racial undertones in the plotting . Ms . Bow , in her second film , and Mr . Turfler easily steal the attention . The Elmer Clifton direction , and photography by A . G . Penrod with Paul H . Allen are outstanding , however ; and , their seafaring scenes are thrilling .
The Patience of Job Skeffington	Desirable , flirtatious Bette Davis ( as Fanny Trellis ) fends off many male admirers ; daily , they arrive at her posh New York estate , to repeatedly propose marriage . Vain , selfish , and very attractive ; Ms . Davis prefers to string her suitors along . During one cocktail hour gathering , Davis discovers her ne'er-do-well brother Richard Waring ( as Trippy Trellis ) has been embezzling funds from Jewish banker Claude Rains ( as Job Skeffington ) . To shield her beloved brother from prosecution , Davis endeavors to wed the ultra-wealthy Mr . Rains . Rains , like most men , has worshiped Davis from afar ; but , she is unable to change her coquettish lifestyle . " The most difficult aspect of the character Fanny was ( that ) she was a famous beauty of her day , " Davis observed , " I was far from being beautiful . " Yet , Davis , with her strength of personality and acting prowess , pulls off the role ; she is , as always , a great one to watch . Rains also performs well ; but , his is more of a supporting role , despite playing the title role . Walter Abel ( as George Trellis ) gets a lot of good camera time , also . And , George Coulouris is exceptional , as Davis ' astute psychoanalyst . " Mr . Skeffington " is a relatively long film , in its " restored " length . Davis and Rains were nominated for " Academy Awards " in the " Best Actress " and " Supporting Actor " categories . The film might have been cited for its decade spanning make-up work , if the category had existed back then . Mr . Skeffington ( 1944 ) Vincent Sherman - Bette Davis , Claude Rains , Walter Abel
All Bets Are Off	The promotional material inarguably reads : " The skill of Academy Award-winning director Steven Soderbergh combines with enough starpower to light up the Las Vegas strip in this classy caper . George Clooney plays Danny , defying the odds in a split-second heist of three Vegas casinos - all owned by a magnate ( Andy Garcia ) who is dating Danny's ex-wife ( Julia Roberts ) . A fixer ( Brad Pitt ) , a pickpocket ( Matt Damon ) , a blackjack dealer ( Bernie Mac ) , a flimflammer ( Carl Reiner ) and others in well-defined roles are with Danny . Are you in or out ? " You're " in " for smooth , star-studded entertainment . The main actor is Mr . Clooney , who has developed a great , almost Cary Grant-like persona . Highlights include Mr . Damon donning a Ripley-type manner , and his well-played " confrontation " with Mr . Mac . Alan Colmes is quite an unexpected boxing fan . In sum , if you think a film can be too slick , " Ocean's Eleven " should prove it inarguably . Ocean's Eleven ( 2001 ) Steven Soderbergh - George Clooney , Brad Pitt , Matt Damon
A Match Made for Ann Dvorak	Unevenly distributed story of three school girls who cross paths again , as adults . Ann Dvorak ( as Vivian Revere ) is , arguably , the film's star ; she plays a sensible , dark-haired beauty who seems to be on the receiving end of life's luckier breaks , but remains unsatisfied . Joan Blondell ( as Mary Keaton ) receives almost as much attention ; she's a " bad girl " who becomes an actress after a stint in reform school . Ms . Blondell contrasts Ms . Dvorak by turning from " bad " to " good " . Bette Davis ( as Ruth Westcott ) rounds out the trio ; she's a sweet and sexy blonde , who fills in both swimsuit and secretarial pools . Dvorak's unfulfilled , desperate housewife steals the high acting honors ; her drug and alcohol drenched characterization is a triumph . Her 1932 performances in " Three on a Match " and " Scarface " might have earned Dvorak some " Best Actress " notice , if times were different . Interestingly , Ms . Davis ' performance is adequate , but bland ; while Blondell is heartfelt and likable . The three actresses illustrate perfectly how essential it is for a capable performer to get the good part ; this is a lesson Davis learned very well - - she wasn't going to let the kind of distribution of roles evident in " Three on a Match " go on for long . The men are almost as much fun as the women . Warren William is natural ( and unrehearsed ) as Dvorak's " perfect " husband , and tempting Lyle Talbot proves himself a sexy lure . Great gangsters include Humphrey Bogart as an intuitive " Harve " , Allen Jenkins as a solid " Dick " , and Edward Arnold as a sure " Ace " . However , Buster Phelps ' " Junior " is dreadfully out-of-place ; as his performance belongs in a Shirley Temple film , not here ; otherwise , Mervyn LeRoy's direction is outstanding . The film seems to put itself on " fast forward " much of the time , giving some of its flawed story elements an even more disjointed feeling . Thankfully , the movie's title is explained therein : " The saying ' Three on a Match means one will die soon ' did not originate in the war , where it was said that to hold a match burning long enough for three lights would attract enemy fire . It did originate with Ivar Kreuger , the Swedish match king , who wanted the world to use more matches . It is reported that the saying brings his companies $5 , 000 , 000 more revenue annually . " You'll see which actress gets the third match .
A Wish for Walsh's Last Command	John Wayne ( as Bob Seton ) stars in a Civil War-era film wherein he runs for Marshall of a Kansas town , against wicked schoolteacher Walter Pidgeon ( as Will Cantrell ) . Of course , they are rivals for the attention of a woman - beautiful Claire Trevor ( as Mary McCloud ) . Roy Rogers adds additional charm as brother McCloud . The story is rather more ordinary than intriguing , but the western scores on several fronts ? First , the direction by Raoul Walsh is outstanding . The production is well-mounted ; it includes the expected exciting climax , but that's not all . . . Even better than the climatic ending is a spectacular sequence involving a stagecoach . Don't miss it ! The indoor scenes are great , too . Watch the scenes in the Barber Shop , for example : witness the sets , direction , and photography . The placement of characters and objects , along with the great street outdoors , provide terrific visual depth . The story doesn't do the production justice , however . And , some of the performances are merely adequate ; and , sometimes they seem unfocused . Mr . Pidgeon's is probably the most consistent of the main players . Mr . Wayne and some of the players might have improved with some additional worked on their characterizations ; and , if the story was sharper , " Dark Command " might have been a truer classic . Dark Command ( 1940 ) Raoul Walsh - John Wayne , Claire Trevor , Walter Pidgeon
Indian Giver	Important early film , directed by D . W . Griffith . Stephen ( Wilfred Lucas ) wants to marry his young ward Blanche Sweet and raise a family . She thinks it's a good idea - until she meets young Charles West . Of course , Mr . Lucas wants to kill Mr . West for coming between he and Ms . Sweet . Lucas , however , decides her happiness is more important ; he gives the couple his blessing ( and home ) ; then , he re-joins the Army . Years pass . Sweet , West , and baby join a Wagon Train . When the Wagon train is attacked by Indians ( Native Americans ) , Lucas arrives to serve as its military escort . Watch for some great shots - like , the distant Wagon Train moving along with a bear in the foreground . The battle scenes are as exciting as you'd expect them to be in a Griffith production . In fact , the battles in " The Massacre " look more realistically fought than in thousands of subsequent westerns . Also noteworthy is Griffith's presentation of the " Indians " . Watch some of the Indians ' body movements , and the way the camera lingers over some of their dead bodies - characters previously introduced sympathetically . Griffith presents Native American characters in a far more sympathetic manner than is usual for the time ( and director ) . The film loses this characterization as the film progresses . The Indians ' point-of-view is dropped . The " love triangle " of characters from the beginning end up only remotely involved in each others ' lives ; and , " The Massacre " misses out on some obvious dramatic possibilities for Sweet , Lucas , and West . The Massacre ( 1914 ) D . W . Griffith - Blanche Sweet , Wilfred Lucas , Charles West
Murray Head Superstar	Jewish doctor Peter Finch ( as Daniel Hirsh ) and divorcée Glenda Jackson ( as Alex Greville ) are both sharing their beds , and bodies , with bisexual artist Murray Head ( as Bob Elkin ) . Alas , Mr . Head wants to leave London for New York , alone , on a bloody Sunday . But , he promises to return " soon " . Mr . Finch and Ms . Jackson will be very lonely without Head . They will go from sharing " half a loaf " of Head , to going with none at all . Director John Schlesinger's follow-up to his " Midnight Cowboy " masterpiece is , as expected , extraordinarily well-directed . However , the relationships do not excite ; and , they are difficult to understand . Jackson and Head are the more believable . Finch and Head try hard ; but , their man-on-man passion does not come across well ; in fact , there were more sparks between Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight in Schlesinger's subtler " Cowboy " . There are many lovingly detailed scenes , beautifully photographed by Billy Williams . Past " Superstar " Bessie Love acts as the answering service lady , and future " Superstar " Daniel Day-Lewis appears as a very naughty boy . Bed-hopping Head co-starred on the " Jesus Christ Superstar " LP play , during " Sunday Bloody Sunday " ; and , his single version of " Superstar " celebrated two runs on the US Pop charts . Everybody's a bloody " Superstar " ! Sunday Bloody Sunday ( 1971 ) John Schlesinger - Peter Finch , Glenda Jackson , Murray Head
Maid in America	In Belgium , during the summer of 1903 wealthy widow Gertrude Astor ( as Louise Bodamere ) finds well-heeled second husband Wilfred Lucas ( as Elton Reeves ) at a North Sea resort . While Ms . Astor and Mr . Lucas enjoy the beach , her daughter Jeanne is cared for by loyal nurse Helen Raymond ( as Marie Gaston ) . Lucas says he doesn't like children ; and mother Astor replies , " Don't be unreasonable , dear - - we probably won't see her more than once a day . " Still , husband Lucas has his way ; and , the newlyweds desert little Jeanne for a luxurious life in the United States . Mary Pickford ( as Jeanne ) is raised as a peasant girl in Belgium , by faithful nurse Raymond . " If it were not for New York hotels , were would elopers , divorcées and red plush furniture go ? " Five years later , her mother returns for Pickford But , Raymond can't give her up ; and , she tells Astor her daughter is dead . By 1914 , the beginning Great War ( World War I ) helps Raymond reconsider keeping the now 15-year-old girl ; and , Pickford is sent to America . She enters " Through the Back Door " of Ellis Island . Through the happenstance of film , Pickford becomes a maid in her own mother's household ; there , she discovers a plot to break up her mother's troubled marriage . And , she finds romance with boy next door John Harron ( as Billy Boy ) . There are a lot of stories in " Through the Back Door " - - perhaps , there are too many . The introductory title cards explain : " This is a love story - - A vision seen through the tears of a mother and a forgotten child - - It echoes the story God whispers to each tiny soul before He blesses it with the miracle of Life - - The story of mother-love . " This description is , in hindsight , somewhat deceptive . And , the story of the " mother-love " between Astor and Pickford is one of the story's least satisfying strands . Instead , enjoy the " little girl " Pickford in the post-abandonment scenes ; especially , when Pickford cleans the mud off the floor wearing scrub brushes as roller-skates ; and wipes her muddy feet on a conveyor belt . After she moves to America , Pickford's romance with Mr . Harron is very sweet ; their meeting effectively sexualizes the mud play seen earlier . It was very nice of Pickford to include John Harron as her " leading man " ; his brother , Robert Harron , died of a gunshot wound the preceding year . Undoubtedly , Pickford admired the deceased Harron's work ( they worked together , at " Biograph " ) . " Laugh and your husband laughs with you , weep , and he laughs with someone else . " Another story receiving a lot of screen time is the faltering marriage of Astor and Lucas , due to the presences of flirty Elinor Fair ( as Margaret Brewster ) . The " love triangle " of the three , complicated by Adolphe Menjou ( as James Brewster ) works about as well at the " mother-love " story between story and Pickford - - or , not very well . The characters ' actions are , simply , not always credible . The location and sets are very pleasing . The directorial team of Alfred E . Green and ( Mary's brother ) Jack Pickford works very well . The ending is another strength ; after Pickford and Harron close the curtains on their parents , they look out a window of uncertainty and excitement .
A Happy New Year for Victor Sjöström	Once upon a time , in Sweden , there was a poor Salvation Army sister . At death's door , she requests , " Send for David Holm ! " But , Victor Sjöström ( as David Holm ) cannot be located , because he is spending New Year's Eve in a graveyard , with his drinking buddies . Dying Sister Astrid Holm ( as Edit ) wants to see if praying for Mr . Sjöström's soul , over the past year , has produced any results ; arguably , it has not . In the graveyard , Sjöström tells the story of " The Phantom Carriage " , which he heard from his dead friend Tore Svennberg ( as Georges ) . According to legend , the last person to die in each year must pick up the souls of all the dead people , until being relieved next New Year's Eve . . . Director Sjöström , whose lead performance is very strong , combines with photographer Julius Jaenzon to create a visually appealing film . The great " double exposure " effect is used frequently , but never seems overdone ; and , it doesn't make the film's other dramatic highlights any less memorable ( for example , Sjöström's tearing of his sewn coat and axing of the door ) . A Selma Lagerlöf story probably wasn't one you could , or would want to , tamper with in the 1920s - which may , or may not be , why the ending of this film is a letdown . And , unlike similar spiritual stories , it's difficult to suspend your disbelief , if you think too carefully about what is really happening in " Körkarlen " . Körkarlen ( / 21 ) Victor Sjöström - Victor Sjöström , Hilda Borgström , Tore Svennberg
Garbo's Back ! ( and Hitchcock's Scratching It )	In London , attractive widow Alida Valli ( as Maddalena Anna Paradine ) is arrested for the poisoning murder of her blind , wealthy husband . Most sympathies lie with the well-respected Ms . Valli ; and , family friend Charles Coburn ( as Simon Flaquer ) arranges for dashing defense attorney Gregory Peck ( as Anthony " Tony " Keane ) to prove her not guilty . Mr . Peck's wife , Ann Todd ( as Gay Keane ) , thinks Valli is innocent ; though , she senses Peck is falling in love with the accused woman . Peck's investigation leads him to handsome Paradine valet Louis Jourdan ( as André Latour ) . Exceptionally well-produced ( David O . Selznick ) and directed ( Alfred Hitchcock ) ; but , the story is far too slow and oblique to engage as it should . No doubt , Greta Garbo would have added greater depth and beauty to the role of " Mrs . Paradine " ; Ms . Garbo turned down the role because she no longer wanted to play this type of character . Foolishly , the filmmakers neglected to offer her the part played by Ann Todd . Todd certainly gets the award for " Best Garbo Performance " in this film ; and her looks approximate Garbo's , in 1947 . Interestingly , Hitchcock stylistically directs Valli as " Mata Hari " , and Todd as " Ninotchka " . Nevertheless , the " two new Selznick stars " , Jourdan and Valli , are very impressive in their roles . Jourdan is particularly effective ; his character is likely bisexual , as subtly noted in the script ( and , on screen , flirting with the coachman ) . The judge assigned to the case is Charles Laughton ( as Thomas Horfield ) ; however , his character's lecherous nature is only rather fleetingly played with . Ethel Barrymore ( as Sophie Horfield ) is a welcome supporting player . And , Lee Garmes ' photography is outstanding .

Rock & Doris & Tony & Vip	Rock Hudson , Doris Day , and Tony Randall are excellent - the movie is not so much . First of all , the film is a one of those sophisticated ( ? ) ' 60s " sex comedies " . There are suggested sexual situations throughout : Mr . Hudson is , I believe , fairly explicitly stated as a promiscuous man ; and , Ms . Day makes a conscious decision to have out-of-wedlock sex with Hudson . Also , there are " gay jokes " ; and , there are suggestions of marijuana use ( note the scene where Hudson explains away an uncomfortable situation by saying he smoked a funny cigarette , lacking a label ) . The advertising industry is effectively satirized . The VIP storyline is funny . The scenes between Hudson / Day and Hudson / Randall are witty and well-played . I liked Hudson and Randall with their beards . You'll get to see Hudson in his underwear ( boxers ) and Day in a bathing suit ( one-piece , alas ) . BUT , the script is filled with tired old jokes . The ending is too rushed . I was VERY distracted by the blurring of Doris Day's close-ups in this film . The other performers have very clear close-ups . I would rather they not blur Ms . Day's close-ups , or just blur everyone . I suppose this is a feature of several of Day's sixties films - it's unfortunate .

Nazimova's First Impression	After losing both her husband and brothers to war , Alla Nazimova ( as Joan ) leads women to protest against their country's king , who has ordered women to bear children for future wars . Nazimova ends it all by proclaiming , " If you will not give us women the right to vote for or against war , " according a title card ending , " I shall not bear a child for such a country ! " ; then , she kills both herself and her unborn child . This film is , unfortunately , lost to the ages ? although , hope strings eternal . . . " War Brides " was based on Nazimova's successful stage play , and marked her film debut . Nazimova ( like Cher and Garbo , a star recognized immediately by one name ) would have made it enough to be remembered for , but " War Brides " added a bonus by presenting Richard Barthelmess ( as Arno ) in his first featured role . The " Diva " also insisted lover Charles Bryant and mother Gertrude Berkeley reprise their stage roles , for the film . Herbert Brenon , who'd been responsible for the recent epic " A Daughter of the Gods " , was employed as director . A search of " War Brides " and " A Play in One Act " will turn up the play's transcript ; but , this film version was exceedingly more elaborate . That , and a reading of Edward Weitzel's article in the December 2 , 1916 " Moving Picture World " suggest it may have been a classic . Critics applauded Nazimova's characterization , and Mr . Brenon's direction . Several of her contemporaries thought Nazimova's follow-up appearance in " Revelation " ( 1918 ) was the best female acting performance of the year . War Brides ( / 16 ) Herbert Brenon - Nazimova , Charles Bryant , Richard Barthelmess
Dust in the Wind	In the 1939 re-release's introduction , William S . Hart explains , " The story of ' Tumbleweeds ' marks one of the greatest epochs of our American history . It tells of the opening of the Cherokee Strip in the year 1889 . Twelve hundred square miles of Cherokee Indian lands , on one front , over two hundred miles long , were thrown open by our government to those seeking good earth upon which they might make their homes . " Mr . Hart ( as Don Carver ) and comic sidekick Lucien Littlefield ( as Kentucky Rose ) are two of the cattle ranchers who are put out when as the Oklahoman Cherokee Strip is " thrown open " by the government . For Hart , the silver lining comes in the form of a several decades younger sweetheart , homesteader Barbara Bedford ( as Molly Lassiter ) ; however , her nasty half-brother J . Gordon Russell ( as Noll Lassiter ) threatens to spoil the fun . Little brother Jack Murphy ( as Bart Lassiter ) and his pup have the highest profile relationship that actually works . Still , the film has Hart ; and , its exciting " land rush ! " sequence . The re-release ( which , apart from Hart's cool Shakespearian appearance , is the inferior version , by the way ) features the legendary star's farewell : " My friends , I loved the art of making motion pictures . It is as the breath of life to me ? no longer a cloud of dust , but a beautiful golden haze through which appears a long phantom herd of trailing cattle . At their head , a Pinto pony ? with an empty saddle ? the boys up ahead are calling - - they're waiting for you and me to help drive this last great round-up into eternity ? " Adios , amigos . God bless you all , each and every one . "
One Good Turn Deserves Another	Norma Shearer ( as Jerry Martin ) tests the freedom acceptable for men , but not permissible for women - the sexual " Double Standard " . As the film opens , Ms . Shearer is an happily married woman . However , husband Chester Morris ( as Ted Martin ) gets " plastered " , and succumbs to the advances of a sexually aggressive woman ? at least , that's what is discernible from the after-the-fact behavior of the adulterous duo , as Shearer catches them in a light embrace . Disillusioned , Shearer turns the tables by having a " one night stand " of her own - with one of the soon-to-be divorced couple's pals . In a film themed like Greta Garbo's recent " The Single Standard " ( 1929 ) , MGM takes another shot at the sexual " Double Standard " . The results are similar , but not the same . Shearer's winning performance is bold , fascinating , and fun to watch ; she elevates the character far above the material . The film's problem is that it pulls its punches with a disappointing ending , extinguishing a truly interesting story . Yet , somehow , Shearer makes the character ring true . It's a strong performance , which manages to rise above the film's abandonment of its thesis . Director Robert Z . Leonard , writer John Meehan , and a fine supporting cast are a great help . Robert Montgomery's performance ( as Don ) is a standout . And , Conrad Nagel ( as Paul ) is another Shearer castoff , who has a potable problem ; he has a harrowing car crash near the film's opening . A lot of alcohol is consumed in this movie ! " The Divorcée " is a flawed , but worthwhile film . The Divorcée ( 1930 ) Robert Z . Leonard - Norma Shearer , Chester Morris , Robert Montgomery
Lightning Strikes Twice	Get ready for a wild ride with the Steven Spielberg " DreamWorks " production team , in this high quality revision of H . G . Wells ' " War of the Worlds " . For this invasion , the story has been updated to focus on the family changes which have become most dominant over the decades since the successful 1953 version . So , the central figure , Tom Cruise ( as Ray Ferrier ) , is not a doctor , but a more ordinary New Jersey dock worker . And , the lead character played by Mr . Cruise is made much more interesting by the fact that he is a divorced man , who is somewhat estranged from his children . Instead of the expected " hot romance " , you have the drama unfolding around the bonding of Cruise and his children . Of course , a lot of disbelief suspension is required , especially in this type of film ; but , the updated situation is refreshing , and believable . When the film begins , Cruise's ex-wife drops off the couple's two children while she goes off to spend some time with her new husband , and parents , in Boston . The children are played well , by Justin Chatwin ( Robbie Ferrier ) and Dakota Fanning ( Rachel Ferrier ) . There is a point ( foreshadowed twice ) where Mr . Chatwin leaves the action ; it seems like a flaw in the storytelling ; but , it does work out quite well . The " son " is replaced by Tim Robbins ( as Harlan Ogilvy ) , in some scenes which would not have worked with the original threesome . Cruise deserves some particular praise , for his performance . He is especially good after suffering a loss , then taking refuge in Mr . Robbins ' basement ; observe his fight to overcome madness , and protect his daughter , in the bowels of the Earth . Cruise's tearful rendition of " Little Deuce Coupe " is one of the film's most memorable moments ; and , it involves no observable " special effect " . The alien " special effects " are fantastic . John Williams is outstanding . Reserving comments on minor difficulties which would reveal too much ; ( except , the narration was unnecessary ) ; the " War of the Worlds " is excellent entertainment . War of the Worlds ( 2005 ) Steven Spielberg - Tom Cruise , Dakota Fanning , Justin Chatwin
Errol Flynn in His Star-Making Turns	Errol Flynn ( as Peter Blood ) is a doctor who quite rightly helps Rebels against Royalty and is condemned to slavery for his offense ; he is bought by Olivia de Havilland ( as Arabella ) , to serve her ruthless Uncle Lionel Atwell ( as Colonel Bishop ) . Soon , " Doctor Blood " escapes to become swashbuckling pirate " Captain Blood " . Mr . Flynn is remarkably new and good in this film ; though he is made-up , he is not made-over - so , his naturalness is stunning . Understandably , the studio outfitted him more and more into these roles ; while they are great , you will see a much more natural performance from Flynn in this film . Ms . de Havilland is likewise new and good ; together , they get magical - assisted by Michael Curtiz ' direction and Hal Mohr's photography . There are some wittily written passages , and a crew of sporting supporting Pirates . While the action sequences will pale by today's standards , the film's pluses will remain timeless . Some asides : I expected scriptwriters to bump off Ross Alexander ( as Jeremy Pitt ) ; he is the best supporting actor , and I was pleasantly surprised by the character's treatment . I don't mind most flaws , but supposedly dead bodies opening their eyes is one that bothers me ; watch for a certain character to open his eyes after death ; specifically , when the second ocean waves over his body ( WHY didn't they just cut out the second wave ? ) Captain Blood ( 1935 ) Michael Curtiz - Errol Flynn , Olivia de Havilland , Ross Alexander
A Child Shall Lead Them	An introduction explains : " The Devil's share in the world's creation was a certain swampland , a masterpiece of horror ; and the Lord , appreciating a good job , let it stand . " The Devil's swampland is where Mary Pickford ( as Molly ) lives , with some orphans and a baby . Ms . Pickford has managed to avoid being thrown in the swamp , over the years , and has assumed the role of " Mother " to the young children . They are kept , as " baby farm " slaves , by wicked Gustav von Seyffertitz ( as Mr . Grimes ) . Mr . von Seyffertitz , Charlotte Mineau ( as Mrs . Grimes ) and Spec O'Donnell ( as son Ambrose ) make a frightfully wicked family . Pickford employs too many of the girlish pouts and lip-twisting grimaces to make this one of her best characterizations ; playing " Molly " as a young woman of indeterminate age would have been fine ( something Pickford would do in her next film , the extraordinary " My Best Girl " ) . Otherwise , the Pickford persona works . As might be expected , the production is first class . Harry Oliver's swampy set is magnificent . The direction of William Beaudine and photography of Charles Rosher , Hal Mohr , and Karl Struss likewise superb . The too long conclusion is noticeably anti-climatic . The special effects and editing are still convincing viewers that Pickford and the children were in some kind of danger during the " alligator-infested swamp escape " sequence . In Booten Herndon's " Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks " ( 1977 ) Mr . Mohr explains , " There wasn't an alligator within ten miles of Miss Pickford . Do people think we were crazy ? I shot that scene myself ? It was hard work for all of us , but the only thing those alligators came close to biting was a chunk of horsemeat . " Fewer people questioned Pickford's meeting with Jesus Christ , in an earlier scene .
Billy Halop leads " The Dead End Kids " to Universal	In their third team appearance , " The ' Dead End ' Kids " are : Billy Halop ( as Johnny Boylan ) , Huntz Hall ( as " Pig " ) , Gabriel Dell ( as " String " ) , Bernard Punsly ( as " Ape " ) , Hal E . " Hally " Chester ( as " Dopey " ) , and David Gorcey ( as " Sniper " ) . After this film , Universal Pictures , the third of several studios to cash in on the Kids ' popularity , adopted " Little Tough Guys " as a series co-title ; possibly , in case United Artists or Warner Brothers legally challenged their use of " Dead End Kids " . In this film " Little Tough Guy " refers to Mr . Halop only , the leader of the pack . Universal was only able to obtain four original " Dead Enders " for their first outing ; so , substituting for Bobby Jordan and Leo Gorcey , and making their first appearances as members of the expanding " Bowery " team , are " Hally " Chester and David Gorcey ( Leo's brother ) . Both would continue with the group . Brat packer Jackie Searl ( as Cyril Gerrard ) , who not only joins , but also takes over as " Little Tough Guys " leader , would only make a couple of peripheral reappearances . Herein , his snobbishness balances the grim and gritty quite nicely . Although you wouldn't expect it , this is one of the best " little " films in the whole " Dead End-East Side-Bowery Kid " cache . The plot is fairly typical , but handled well - Halop's teen angst turns to anger after his father is wrongly arrested , for killing a policeman . Following a miscarriage of justice , Halop soothes his sorrows by descending into a " Dead End " lifestyle . Halop has a firm grasp of this material , and performs the melodrama with his usual expertise . Another cast member tuning in an excellent performance is matronly Marjorie Main ( as Mrs . Boylan ) . A keen actress , Ms . Main gives her " mother " character an almost unseemly underbelly . Note how Main's " theatrics " fit perfectly with the lines her children address her with : daughter Helen Parish ( as Kay Boylan ) says , " Oh Mom , quit acting , " and Halop tells Main , " Gee , Ma , you look just like a movie star . " So , Main plays her part as a failed movie star , lamenting her age and poverty . The 1930s New York City interior and exterior sets are terrific . Halop says , " I gotta keep moving , " and director Harold Young fills the running time with a lot of movement - there are people everywhere . Both Young and photographer Elwood Bredell excel . Ms . Parrish and Robert Wilcox ( as Paul Wilson ) are sweet , in the " romantic " adult roles . There are a myriad of extras , with Richard Selzer ( as Bud ) among the " worst dressed " background kids - later , Mr . Selzer became the " Top 10 " fashion conscious " Mr . Blackwell " . Little Tough Guy ( / 38 ) Harold Young - Billy Halop , Jackie Searl , Marjorie Main
Keep the Home Fires Burning	Faithful wife Claudette Colbert ( as Anne Hilton ) , and daughters Jennifer Jones ( as Jane Hilton ) and Shirley Temple ( as Bridget " Brig " Hilton ) keep the World War II home fires burning ? and burning ? and burning ? in David O . Selznick's eagerly awaited follow-up to his two extraordinary " Best Picture " Oscar winners : " Gone with the Wind " and " Rebecca " . " Since You Went Away " doesn't rate with those classics , but it does compare favorably with most other films released in 1944 . The cast is certainly " All-Star ! " - fronted by the teary performances of top actresses Claudette Colbert , Jennifer Jones , and Shirley Temple . Ms . Colbert and Ms . Jones characterize well . Ms . Temple is less effective ; although , scenes like the reading of her father's letter are nicely played . Temple was better as an actress , in fact , than in many of her more successful child roles ; and , she only falters when slipping too heavily into the old persona . Male support is provided by : Joseph Cotten ( as Tony Willett ) , a lieutenant who'd like to have had a go with Colbert ; Monty Woolley ( as William G . Smollett ) , a grandfatherly sage ; and , Robert Walker ( as William ' Bill ' Smollett II ) , a corporal who takes a liking to Jones . Off-screen , Jones was breaking up with Mr . Walker ( her husband ) , and taking up with Selznick . Agnes Moorehead ( as Emily Hawkins ) gives the film some much-needed friction , by going against the patriotic grain . And , Hattie McDaniel ( as Fidelio ) is charming in her updated " Mammy " role . Given the star-studded cast , it's surprising to see so little energy transmitted from the screen ; or , at least , not enough to justify the long running time . As an ensemble , the cast never quite coalesces . There is more energy transmitted in " cameo " roles by Lionel Barrymore , Guy Madison , and Nazimova . Mr . Madison , in his first film role , gives the film some sex appeal when he tries to pick up Jones in a bowling alley . Ms . Nazimova , in her last film role , recites an accented " Give me your tired , your poor , your huddled masses yearning to breathe free ? " speech that gets to the point ( at last ) . The photography ( Stanley Cortez and Lee Garmes ) and music ( Max Steiner ) are beautiful . Cortez , Garmes , and director John Cromwell give the film a dark shadowy style ; and , many scenes , with sparse dialog , are magical . One of the best parts of the film occurs when Walker goes off to war , leaving Jones at a train station . Mr . Steiner's score is one of his most successful , and suitable ; it helped send several records , like " Together " , up the hit parade . Recommended for everyone with a 1940s wartime sensibility ( which was this film's intended audience ) . Otherwise , get yourself in the right frame of mind , and have a few hours to spare for " Since You Went Away " . Since You Went Away ( 1944 ) John Cromwell - Claudette Colbert , Jennifer Jones , Shirley Temple
If I Were a Carpenter	Cecil B . De Mille's EPIC " The King of Kings " is his New Testament follow-up to the Old Testament EPIC " The Ten Commandments " ( 1923 ) . These films are better than their sound-era re-makes ; their lack of spoken dialog makes them seem more reverent , somehow . DeMille even promises this , " play ( is ) a reverent part in the spirit of ( Christ's ) great command . " To introduce his version of Jesus Christ ( H . B . Warner ) , " The King of Kings " heals a blind girl - as the girl opens her eyes , Mr . Warner becomes the Christian sin-savior . It's one of many marvelous bits of film-making . For its time , this was a very artistic , well-produced film . In a foreword to accompany this picture , DeMille wrote , " At no time in the world's history has humanity so hungered for the Truth . Science has declared there is a God . And a groping , eager World cries , ' How may we find Him ? ' The answer goes back two thousand years , to a Man who stood with a little band of ragged followers in the midst of bigotry , cruelty and ignorance - lighting with the torch of His own life the flame of hope in the heart of man and showing us by sublime Sacrifice - Death and Resurrection - our own Immortality . " DeMille takes liberties with the story , but doesn't waver too far from what could have happened in the lives of the characters . For example , since the affairs of Mary Magdalene ( Jacqueline Logan ) aren't explicitly documented , DeMille ( with writer Jeanie Macpherson ) creates one , to introduce and move the story along . With a prominently jeweled bust , Ms . Logan's " Mary " meets Christ after learning her lover , Judas Iscariot ( Joseph Schildkraut ) , is spending too much time with the Divine one . But , in casting an older man as Christ , DeMille helps avoid possibly making Christ appear too erotic . The film benefits from some story tinkering ; however , it still plays like a series of stilted vignettes - most of the time . One of the more memorable moments occurs when a girl asks Christ to " heal " her doll's broken leg . This simple scene stands out , due to its lack of miraculous content . The " special effects " highlight in " King of Kings " is the rollicking crucifixion ; and , like " Ten Commandments " , some color footage is included . Watch closely , and you'll see the character " Judas " steal the picture ; and , overall , Mr . Schildkraut's hanging disciple is the film's most memorable character . The King of Kings ( 1927 ) Cecil B . DeMille - H . B . Warner , Joseph Schildkraut , Jacqueline Logan
Strawberry Flats Forever	Mary Pickford ( as Jenny Lawrence ) finds herself all alone in New England , after the elder Mrs . Lawrence dies ; so , she moves to the " Gold Rush " state of California , to live with her uncle . What she doesn't know ( initially ) is that her uncle has been killed by Indians ( Native Americans ) ; and , outlaw Elliott Dexter ( as " Black " Brown ) has assumed his identity . Arriving in the little mining town of Strawberry Flats , Ms . Pickford discovers Mr . Dexter's charade , and learns of her uncle's death . Dexter demands Pickford pretend she's his niece ; and , with nowhere to go , Pickford agrees . First and foremost , Dexter and Pickford are marvelous in the lead roles . Dexter begins to amaze when , in a barroom scene , he rescues Pickford from the advances of Raymond Hatton ( as Dick Roland ) . Pickford performed nicely when first entering her shabby new home , but becomes amazing when waking in the shed up as a wolf howls ? the two exude an unmistakable sexuality in their earliest scenes together , assisted by fine light and shadows direction from Cecil B . DeMille ( and , watch how the camera places their hands in a couple of scenes ) . As the film moves along , it loses focus on some of the sensuality , unfortunately . A subtle scene showing the leads ' passion would have been nice . Joining Hatton , supporting players Charles Ogle ( as Jim Lyn , who dates Pickford ) , Tully Marshall ( as barman Sam Sparks ) , and Walter Long ( as the Sheriff ) are entertaining . Pickford's last minute way of getting the townfolk to reconsider Dexter's fate is ingenious . The fact that " twenty men are fooled by one small woman " was nicely put , especially since it involved a doll given to Dexter's so-called " little girl " ! A Romance of the Redwoods ( 1917 ) Cecil B . DeMille - Mary Pickford , Elliott Dexter , Charles Ogle
Gods and Monsters	In order to claim his rightful throne , Todd Armstrong ( as Jason ) must find the legendary Golden Fleece ; the assembled " Jason and the Argonauts " assume the quest , but are stymied by a series of monstrous obstacles . Behind the scenes , the Greek Gods ( led by Zeus and Hera ) are fighting over the mission's outcome . The heroic Mr . Armstrong also catches the eyes of mortals Gary Raymond ( as Acastus ) and Nancy Kovack ( as Medea ) , but ? for different reasons . Ray Harryhausen's special effects are outstanding ; especially noteworthy are the dueling skeletons near the film's end - - and , the " stop motion animation " is excellent throughout . The skeleton sequence , and others , like the statue of Talos " coming-to-life " , are classic . Armstrong portrays the hero " Jason " handsomely , while Nancy Kovack ( as Medea ) and Honor Blackman ( as Hera ) add feminine charm . Don Chaffey ( director ) and Bernard Herrmann ( musician ) also excel . The supporting cast and crew is stronger than you'd expect in a film of this type ; Mr . Raymond is the best supporting actor , with his clear , focused characterization of " Acastus " . Raymond's underrated performance provides some unexpected dramatic tension - - note how he calculatingly observes Armstrong , catching both the hero and the viewer off-guard . Jason and the Argonauts ( 1963 ) Don Chaffey - Todd Armstrong , Gary Raymond , Nancy Kovack
Beautiful Spectacle from Ingram with Novarro	Ramon Novarro stars as André-Louis Moreau . Lewis Stone is Moreau's enemy , the Marquis de la Tour d'Azyr . And , Alice Terry is the woman they both love , Aline de Kercadiou . The story is set during the time of the French Revolution . The film begins with Mr . Stone as the Marquis de la Tour killing Mr . Novarro ( Moreau's ) best friend , which makes them great enemies . Enemies usually like the same woman ; in this case , the coveted Ms . Terry ( as Aline ) creates the additional animosity . This is a well-produced spectacle , from director Rex Ingram ; the film obviously cost a fortune , and the money was well spent , creating a beautiful looking film . Mr . Ingram does a great job of pacing the approximately two hours of film ; it retains much of its pace today , relative to other 1920s epics . Ingram's cinematographer John F . Seitz and star Ramon Novarro are indispensable . Mr . Seitz ' photography is great , from the windmilly opening until the final conflicts . Some of the spectacular scenes are still terrific ; but , some do look like they were staged to fit the movie screen , where everyone gathers for " Action ! " Mr . Novarro's lead performance is excellent ; though , it might have been wise to let him use more of the ahead-of-their-time skills that are clearly evident . But , what's left is fine - best are the " looks " from the performers , which are not overacted ( mostly ) . Lewis , Terry , and most everyone performs well . Novarro must join an acting troupe , by the way , while on-the-run - he becomes " Monsieur X " and play acts clown " Scaramouche " , giving the film its title . Watch for the relationship between Novarro and a woman from the troupe , and the reason he finally rejects her ( it parallels the major love triangle ) . Also , watch for two of the characters to startlingly look exactly like / alike the " shocking " second revelation at the end of the film . Scaramouche ( 1923 ) Rex Ingram - Ramon Novarro , Lewis Stone , Alice Terry
Metro-Goldwyn-Coogan	In " New York , a world within a city , where anything might happen , " Irish Catholic lower East Side kid Jackie Coogan ( as Timothy Kelly ) survives a fire at St . John's Orphanage fire , and takes to the streets . Ten-year-old Coogan meets Jewish junk dealer Max Davidson ( as Max Ginsberg ) ; and , after Coogan returns Mr . Davidson's dropped wallet , he moves in with the rheumatic old man . The two become business partners " Ginsberg and Kelly " , after Coogan proves his " Rag Man " mettle by filling Davidson's junk truck with four dollars worth of merchandise . Along the way , Coogan helps right and old wrong ; he tracks down thieving Robert Edeson ( as Mr . Bernard aka Mr . Bishop ) , who robbed Davidson of a patent fortune . " The Rag Man " is a top-of-the-line Metro-Goldwyn-Coogan production , smoothly directed by Edward F . Cline ; it is highlighted by the Frank Good / Robert Martin photography , which features some great New York City sets and locations . Coogan and Davidson aren't very original , basically re-treading their " Kid " and " Izzy " characterizations ; but , the Irish / Jewish teaming adds some freshness ( as does Linda Martinez ' new soundtrack ) . In the sequel " Old Clothes " , Coogan and Davidson wisely take in young Joan Crawford ( as Mary Riley ) as a boarder . The Rag Man ( 1925 ) Edward F . Cline - Jackie Coogan , Max Davidson , Robert Edeson
Mary Pickford Makes it Work	Mary Pickford ( as Jerusha " Judy " Abbott ) is found , as a baby , in a garbage dump . Orphaned , she is brought to the " John Grier Home " , where young boys and girls are treated more like convicts than children . By the time she is 12 , little Mary is leading the orphans in a strike against eating prunes . Some years later , Ms . Pickford is the beneficiary of a lucky , life-changing event : one of the orphanage's new trustees wants to sponsor an orphan's higher education ; and Pickford is chosen . At college , Pickford is a fetching young woman , which sends Cupid's arrows flying . Love-struck Princeton man Marshall Neilan ( as Jimmie Mc Bride ) and " older man " ( as Jarvis Pendleton ) vie for Pickford's hand in marriage . Pickford becomes a writer ; her first effort fails , but she instinctively follows the advice " write what you know " in creating a successful tome about orphans . Finally , Pickford must choose her man , and payback her " mysterious benefactor " . Some of " Daddy-Long-Legs " doesn't ring true ; vignettes are cute , in isolation , but add little to the overall film ; it's obvious , for example , that the children experience some childhood fun , which is said to be completely absent . And , the cruelty of the " John Grier Home " is hardly comparable to a prison ! You may also wonder why a fully clothed boy is considered " naked " , how a baby might have digested a mouth organ , how that girl got in and out of the well , and other stuff . The film is not at all unpredictable . However , Mary Pickford is outstanding . She very believably plays " Judy " - - growing from a precocious 12-year-old girl to young career woman . As the film progresses , Pickford seems to add layers upon her character . For example , in some later scene , beginning at a society party where Pickford admires some ancestral portraits ; watch , as the party progresses , both Pickford's past , and future , register on her face . Pickford constructs her character extremely well . Director Marshall Neilan ( who also appears , as Jimmie Mc Bride ) was an important Pickford collaborator ; and the supporting cast is delightful . Wesley Barry is wonderful as Pickford's early orphan pal ; he manages to steal scenes from Mary Pickford - - 11-year-old Barry play " drunk " better than Pickford ! Carrie Clark Ward is delightful as love-weary " Mrs . Semple " , and Fay Lemport ( as Angelina Wyckoff ) shows how pampered , selfish little girls grow up . " Daddy-Long-Legs " was filmed again and again , but this is the definitive version , thanks , mainly , to Mary Pickford .
Colleen Moore's Cinderella Story	Because the plot of this very well-produced silent film is so easily recognizable as " Cinderella " , it can be one of your most enjoyable introductions to both the silent film genre , and to one of its most popular actresses , Colleen Moore . The film was an adaptation of the then popular new comic strip " Ella Cinders " , with changes to the heroine's situation that were perfectly suited to a silent film starring Ms . Moore . The film easily transcends its source , and succeeds as prime example of the often repeated story about a young woman achieving her dream to become a Hollywood movie star - itself , a " Cinderella " story . Who knew comic strips could be perfect silent film fodder ? The Hollywood " movie set " scenes aren't as clever as in other films of this type , despite the appearance of Harry Langdon and others , in cameos . Director Alfred E . Green , Lloyd Hughes ( as George Waite ) , and Vera Lewis ( as Ma Cinders ) make good contributions . Interestingly , Moore is best on screen , alone , with a lion or fire ; and , when attempting to , " Master the art of expressing every emotion with the eyes , " imitate Jackie Coogan , and pose at a " photo session " for the movie star contest she eventually wins . " Ella Cinders " was a huge success , and helped propel Colleen Moore to the # 1 position on Quigley Publications ' " Box Office Stars " list for 1926 . Ella Cinders ( / 26 ) Alfred E . Green - Colleen Moore , Lloyd Hughes , Vera Lewis
How the West Was Fun	This movie is A LOT of fun . As it begins , Jane Fonda is about to be hanged . Nat King Cole and Stubby Kaye appear throughout , dramatizing events with their singing of " The Ballad of Cat Ballou " . We don't know Fonda's crime - but , we are flashbacked to tell the story . Ms . Fonda comes home from school to find her father killed by a corrupt town . Fonda's gang assembles - Michael Callan , whom she meets in bed , Tom Nardini , an Indian ranchman , and Dwayne Hickman , a young uncle . Since none of them can shoot , they hire gunslinger Lee Marvin for $50 . 00 . Sadly , Mr . Marvin is delivered in a drunken stupor ; he can hardly stand up , let alone defend Jane . Director Elliot Silverstein keeps the pace very lively ; there is always something going on , or about to happen - most of it funny . The movie is a " spoof " of the western . If you can't stomach western spoofery , you may not enjoy the film , which could be your loss . The scene I found funniest ( but not the laugh out loud funniest ) was when Mr . Nardini was preparing Mr . Marvin for the big confrontation . Nardini takes out a girdle to squeeze on Marvin's body - you can picture dozens of aging western actors going through the same thing just to appear in front of the movie camera ! I imagine there were A LOT of long faces on western actors , while watching " Cat Ballou " ( if they dared ) . Jay C Flippen and some western regulars give the movie some authenticity - they must have seen their share of drunken western actors . Nardini is also an Indian who does NOT ACT LIKE A WESTERN MOVIE Indian . He corrects educated Fonda's grammar ( " Whom " ) . Watch how he " scalps " someone in the early brawl ? watch his " salute " to the prepared-to-fight Marvin . And , Marvin is GREAT throughout - note the different ways he plays his role ( s ) , making the role so much FUN to watch . Fonda is excellent too ? always staying true to her character ; as Marvin takes the movie's looser reigns , Fonda plays it steady . EVERYONE is great , actually . The other young men , Callan & Hickman . . . always right . Even the minor cast players ( " My name is ? " ) . . . Perhaps the story went in a couple of directions for the sake of an additional skit or two , but who cares ? Just Enjoy ! Cat Ballou ( 1965 ) Elliot Silverstein - Jane Fonda .

Come Back When You Grow Up	This review recommends you watch the " directors ' cut " before sampling the " theatrical version " of " The Butterfly Effect " . Also , it will also enhance the film's effect if you refrain from reading the comments , good and bad , until after viewing ; I was more intrigued by the storyline because I wasn't completely sure where the psychology and physics were going to wind up . The writer / director team of Eric Bress and J . Mackye Gruber kept me guessing as I did not read any comments , or even the DVD sleeve's synopsis . Bress and Gruber weave an extremely intricate , thought out , well paced , and imaginative drama . The protagonist is unstuck young " Evan Treborn " ( played by Ashton Kutcher , John Patrick Amedori , and Logan Lerman ) . The film traces the lives of Evan and three childhood friends : " Kayleigh " ( Amy Smart , Irene Gorovaia , and Sarah Widdows ) , " Tommy " ( William Lee Scott , Jesse James , and Cameron Bright ) , and " Lenny " ( Elden Henson , Kevin Schmidt , and Jake Kaese ) . Kayleigh and Tommy's abusive father ( Eric Stoltz ) , and Evan's loving mother ( Melora Walters ) are the main parental figures . To say the cast exceeds expectations would be an understatement . The overall effect left by the interrelating performances is remarkable , and rarely achieves at the level evident . This is also a technically beautiful film . Be prepared . The character " George Miller " is a pedophile , who has obviously abused his children ( off screen ) . " Mr . Miller " invites young Evan and his daughter to get undressed for his camera ; it is a non-erotic , tastefully filmed scene . But , the violence , especially between the young children , is disturbing to the extreme ; certainly , it shows the most devastating effects of child abuse . In the case of " The Butterfly Effect " , artistic license trumps irreparable damages . " I'll come back for you " indeed . The Butterfly Effect ( 2004 ) Eric Bress , J . Mackye Gruber - Ashton Kutcher , Amy Smart , William Lee Scott ( Theatrical Edition ) The Butterfly Effect ( 2004 ) Eric Bress , J . Mackye Gruber - Ashton Kutcher , Amy Smart , William Lee Scott , Elden Henson ( Directors ' Cut )
The Sound of Silence	Working class Irishmen Lars Hanson ( as Gypo Nolan ) and Carl Harbord ( as Francis McPhillipp ) are members of an anti-establishment " Party " , where politics is punctuated with gunfire . While maintaining a friendship with his comrade , Mr . Hanson is obviously interested in Mr . Harbord's fickle moll , the lovely Lya de Putti ( as Katie Fox ) . After Harbord kills the local police chief ( during a gunfight ) he is driven underground ; leaving Ms . de Putti free to hook up with Hanson . Then , when Harbord surfaces to visit his mother , Hanson suspects he is seeing de Putti . So , Hanson becomes " The Informer " , hounded by detective Warwick Ward ( as Dan Gallagher ) . Fascinating , superb direction from Arthur Robison , and gorgeous photography from Theodor Sparkuhl and Werner Brandes , highlight this undiscovered classic . Director Robison and crew are always moving the picture ; even a background window is filled - - if only with the shadows of passing figures . The crowds of people are a moving backdrop for the film's atmospheric array of shadows , alleys , streets , police , and prostitutes . Although " The Informer " is labeled " A British International Picture " , it might more accurately be described as a " German Film Noir " . John Ford re-made " The Informer " in 1935 ; and , obviously , he was influenced by this version . Heavily accented leading players Hanson ( Swedish ) and de Putti ( Hungarian ) found their film careers killed by talking pictures , regrettably . Their performances are excellent ? . . . then . . . After about 45 minutes , the film changes from " silent " to " talking " . The switch works as a dramatic device ; although , it certainly couldn't have been planned by cast and crew . More probably , the studio ordered the change , as the popularity of all-silent films plummeted . The decision might have been a sound one ; however , the voices dubbing Hanson and de Putti are inadequate . A restoration of " The Informer " , with improved dubbing , could remedy the situation . The eerie " your mother has forgiven me " ending , with Hanson achieving Salvation , must remain , however . If , for some reason , you feel inclined to leave this version of " The Informer " unfinished , don't dare miss the last few minutes of work from actor Hanson and director Robison .
Sidney Poitier's Defining Role	Sidney Poitier ( as Mark Thackeray ) wants to be an engineer , but finds jobs scarce ; so , he takes a job teaching a group of unmanageable East End London secondary ( high ) school students . The inexperienced Mr . Poitier has no control in the classroom . With only a few weeks before graduation , he decides to teach discipline and respect . Poitier's biggest classroom problem is rebellious youth Christian Roberts ( as Denham ) . He also has to deal with pretty blonde Judy Geeson ( as Pamela ) , who develops a " schoolgirl crush " on her handsome black teacher . Poitier doesn't seem to be doing much academic teaching ; but , with only a few weeks to go , he makes some instinctive , wise decisions . As the students ' " newest replacement " , he must start with extensive classroom management . Mostly , the students like to dance and smoke cigarettes . But , through the young cast's performances , and their scripted background , you believe they are worse than they appear on film . The film is a simplistic representation . Poitier's dignified characterization is superb . As " Mr . Thackeray " , he handles societal racism with quiet reservation . Thackeray does not verbalize any racial " blame " for his 18-month failure to find an engineering job . He grins sweetly when the ladies on the bus hint about his sexual prowess . He does not respond to the cynical teacher's bait . And , he responds with non-sensual sincerity to the film's interested blondes . More than anything , Thackeray values courtesy , which is evidenced by his first " tantrum " . Thatcher is a man of polite manners , who values respect . He demands the students call him " Sir " . Poitier's command for respect works not only with the students , but also with the audience . Poitier cuts through the film , and demands the same respect from the audience . You call him SIR ! So , the " lesson " achieves the unexpected - - both Thackeray and Poitier are successful with their audience . The audience responded by making Poitier a " Box Office " superstar . It was the right message , the right time , and the right man . Director James Clavell and the Lulu-sung title song are also outstanding . Most movie award organizations favored Poitier's two successive 1967 films . But , " To Sir , with Love " did very well with the " Film Daily " critics : " To Sir , with Love " was the year's # 4 Film , and # 1 song . Poitier was the # 3 " Best Actor " ( one better than his " In the Heat of the Night " role ) , Christian Roberts was " Juvenile Actor " # 2 , and Judy Geeson won as # 1 " Juvenile Actress " .

A Cookie Full of Arsenic	" It's late at night in the steamy , neon-lit streets of New York's Times Square , and everything's buzzing with nervous energy . But press agent Sidney Falco ( Tony Curtis ) is oblivious to the whirlwind of street vendors , call girls and con men bustling around him as he nervously waits for the early edition of ' The Globe ' . Whose career did gossip columnist J . J . Hunsecker ( Burt Lancaster ) launch today ? and whose did he destroy ? " " A powerful film about a ruthless journalist and an unscrupulous press agent who'll do anything to achieve success , this fascinating , compelling story " should have been nominated for : " Best Picture " James Hill , " Best Actor in a Leading Role " Tony Curtis , " Best Actor in a Supporting Role " Burt Lancaster , " Best Director " Alexander Mackendrick , " Best Writing " Ernest Lehman & Clifford Odets , " Best Cinematography " James Wong Howe , and " Best Music ( Scoring ) " Elmer Bernstein . The film was too vicious to have been nominated for anything , however . Herein , sleazy Curtis finds his career threatened when he fails to stop his jazz musician cousin , Martin Milner ( as Steve Dallas ) , from engaging megalomaniacal Lancaster's nineteen-year-old kid sister , Susan Harrison ( as Susan Hunsecker ) . " Sweet Smell of Success " captures the perceived sleaze of the " Great White Way " columnist ( " read ? Walter Winchell " ) in a style that would make " Citizen Kane " stand up and cheer ( if he were , say ? William Randolph Hearst ) . Sweet Smell of Success ( 1957 ) Alexander Mackendrick - Tony Curtis , Burt Lancaster , Susan Harrison , Martin Milner
Mary Pickford Is " My Best Girl "	Mary Pickford ( as Maggie Johnson ) is a lowly " 5 & 10 cent " stockroom worker . One day , while covering a salesclerk's station , she encounters cute Charles " Buddy " Rogers ( as Joe " Grant " Merrill ) . Ms . Pickford thinks Mr . Rogers is a customer ; so , she tries to sell him on a Devil Doll - blowing it up for size ! The two are mutually attracted ; and , Rogers is happily assigned to be Pickford's stockroom ward . Pickford doesn't know it , but Rogers is actually millionaire store owner Hobart Bosworth ( as Robert E . Merrill ) ' s son , posing as a " commoner " in order to earn some business sense . Moreover , Rogers is engaged to marry his societal equal , Avonne Taylor ( as Millicent Rogers ) ? This was Pickford's final silent film ; and , in hindsight , she might have been wise to end her career right here , on top . " My Best Girl " is an indispensable film , one of several late 1920s films which show the silent film had achieved a considerable level of artistic sense . It's difficult to point out single pieces , since the entire film works so well ; however , the rainy location scenes are notably exquisite . Director Sam Taylor and Pickford shine throughout . Dave Kesson , Charles Rosher , and Jack Schulze make outstanding contributions . This is one of Pickford's finest performances ; and , she forms an extraordinary partnership with relative newcomer Rogers . Their scenes together are magical , rivaling the more rustic Lillian Gish / Robert " Bobby " Harron romances directed by D . W . Griffith . Pickford and Rogers later took the chemistry evident on film to heart , and formed a more long-term partnership ; their wedding and " newsreel " footage provide a lovely coda for " My Best Girl " . . . Life imitates art . My Best Girl ( / 27 ) Sam Taylor - Mary Pickford , Charles ' Buddy ' Rogers , Lucien Littlefield , Hobart Bosworth
