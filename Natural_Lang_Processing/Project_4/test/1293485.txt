" I still support the railing system ! "	Ah , Space Mutiny , definitely one of the best Mystery Science Theater 3000 episodes , it's one of my favorites personally . I think the reason why this is such a great episode is due to the fact that this film is just so unbelievably bad , you know ? I mean these are the kind of movies that you just look at and question constantly how it got green lighted since it's just such an awful film . I'm not just saying bad , I'm saying that there must have been about 5 million things wrong with this movie . There are tons and tons of continuity problems , a woman who dies in one scene , then the next scene she is a noticeable extra that's alive and well . The " hero " of the film has extremely horrible acting qualities , not to mention that he screams like a girl . The " sexy lady " of the story looks like she's in her late fifties and again , her acting is lousy . The " villain " won't stop with this ridiculous laughter . The story itself is just a bad one . The people in space on the Southern Sun are supposedly happy and looking for a new world to create something new and peaceful . But some apparently have grown impatient , like Calgon ( yeah , that's the villain's name , sad , isn't it ? ) and his " wise " followers . But the leader of the Southern Sun , who looks a lot like Santa Claus , wishes peace , so he assigns Dave Ryder to save the day . Along with Santa's daughter , Lea , she and Dave pretty much have to out maneuver Calgon , just for God's sake , who couldn't ? I mean the man's body guard looks like a lobster . Space Mutiny is just in general a very bad film . I mean Mystery Science Theater 3000 sometimes gets some movies that are not so bad , but Space Mutiny is one of those films that is all around just a bad mistake . I'm not sure if they people who made this movie really looked at it in the editing room and really thought that this was an excellent or decent movie . The acting , the editing , the continuity , THE COSTUMES , the sets , the actors , everything about this movie was just plain bad . The sounds and script was just so laughable . Space Mutiny is not even good enough to be a cult film , the only thing that this film was good for was just the fact that it made one of the best Mystery Science Theater 3000 episodes . But I have to admit that Calgon did blow me away , lol .
The chickiest flick I have ever seen in my life	Oh , my God , I swear I nearly killed myself while my friend and I were watching this movie . I'm not a chick flick girl and this movie is the reason why . Now I actually do love a few chick flicks that are fun , clever , and just harmless . This movie is extremely harmful to anyone who watches it , after watching this movie I felt like shoe shopping , listening to Sarah McLaughlin , bonding with my mother , moving my furniture , talking about boys , and baking cookies . This is the ultimate stereotype for women and makes us just look oh so bad . But it looked cute from the cover and I like Diane Keaton and Mandy Moore , so I wanted to give this movie a chance , but instead it just wasted my time and made me throw up a little in my mouth . I know that sounds bad since I'm a girl , but how in the heck was I supposed to like these characters ? They were awful . Daphne is a protective , manipulative , and pesky little mother who just loves her daughters more than most mothers should . She's especially obsessed with her baby daughter , Milly , who is having a hard time in the love department . Daphne takes out an ad on the internet as a mom looking for her daughter's life partner . She meets Jason , a promising guy who is stable , and a guy , Johnny , a musician with a psychotic son that she's convinced is a heart breaker . Milly meets them both looking " like chance " and she has to decide between stable , rich Jason or sensitive , loving Johnny . You can figure it out from here . Seriously , these characters were horrible , just first off Daphne just comes off as a possessive and psychotic mom who needs a life so badly , because she's living it through her daughter's . Then Milly , she's dating and sleeping with these two guys at once and then when she gets busted , she's crying and we're supposed to feel bad for her ? Why wasn't she just honest with the guys in the first place ? The ending was horribly cliché'd as a chick flick film and was incredibly disturbing in some moments . This is an awful movie , I wouldn't recommend it unless you are the ultimate chick flick fan .
Horrible	How the Grinch Stole Christmas was a wonderful little Christmas cartoon that anyone could easily enjoy , I never did see the reason for a remake . Not to mention a remake that was made with humans , the cartoon was just perfect enough , what's the purpose of this film ? But it also seemed a little odd for Jim Carrey to be the Grinch . I mean he's a great comedic actor , but him as the Grinch ? It just didn't make any sense to me . His performance was a little over the top and unintentionally laughable at moments . Not to mention some of the added dialog was a bit childish and not enjoyable . The whole story of the Grinch and Cindy Lou-Who was over done and wasn't needed . They actually just destroyed the story , period . All the who's in Whoville are getting ready for their best Christmas season yet where everything is intended to go perfectly . But Cindy Lou-Who is curious and worried about the Grinch that lives above them and that he's not going to get as good of a Christmas as the other who's . He kicks her out and decides that he doesn't want Christmas this year and that in fact he should just steal Christmas all together to show the who's what his version of Christmas is all about . But soon he realizes that the who's may know that it's a little bit more than what is the materialized version of Christmas . How the Grinch Stole Christmas wasn't needed and was a bit over the top . I really recommend that you stick with the cartoon just for the simple fact that this is a pretty disturbing version , at least in my opinion . The make up and presentation of the whole film was just a bit over done , not to mention that How the Grinch Stole Christmas ! was more meant to be as a cartoon rather than a version starring Jim Carry . But at least this version makes you grateful for the Boris Karloff version that is played every Christmas .
Let's put it this way . . .	After this painful movie , I drank , I did illegal substances , I even beat myself with a shovel , and still I was in pain from watching this horrible movie ! The Haunting of Molly Hartley or as I'm going to call it from this point on " pretty white kids with satanic problems " , where do I eve begin on how awful this film was ? OK , let's start with the actors , horrible horrible actors that only got their roles because they were just too beautiful to pass up on . The editing / scare tactics : let's make loud noise constantly , that'll make the audience jump . The script : let's make up a non-sense story about a teenage girl who has powers from Satan and we'll put her in high school with other pretty people and while she has to go through the hardships of being a teenager . Even though the story in no way makes sense , we have a Zac Efron look a like , so we're going to get a huge female teen audience and they'll love this film . Oh , boy , I'm rambling , OK , let's just say this , if you were , you'd see all the bruises on my head from banging it on the wall after watching this movie that I'll never know how it got green lighted . Molly Hartley is the new girl at school who is very subtle about her strange side , she has headaches that lead to disillusions about her mother who tried to kill her a few years ago , she automatically stays away from people and is getting hit on by the most pretty rich boy in the whole school , but she is absolutely refusing to do anything until her father takes her to the hospital and they find a brain tumor , so it seems like everything will be all good after they remove it , but things are obviously not getting better when her mother escapes the insane asylum to kill Molly before she hits her 18th birthday to gain full powers of the devil . . . yeah , wow . Oh , boy , I wish there was a rating lower than 1 , because honestly this film is one of the worst I've ever seen in my life . It's just so odd to me that there are some films that people absolutely refuse to give a fair chance , yet this movie that has no right to be called a horror movie has a 3 . 4 rating ? Come on , this belongs in the bottom 100 here on IMDb , I'm going to be a good citizen , please , stay away from this movie , save yourself the pain I had to endure . I had to take my cousin to see this , now I feel that I can never let her pick a film again , because for my health's sake , I just can never see a movie like this again , I'll go insane . Just trust me , this is a very very bad film , film ? Why did I say that ? This is trash , just trust me , the only thing horrific about this is that I wasted 90 minutes of my life that I will never get back . . . I could have watched paint dry , that has more meaning than this stupid movie ever will .
I tell ya , the new generation sucks	Well , at least this was the last sequel that I could find at Blockbuster , because this movie was just downright horrible . I mean , I can understand how hard it would be to get rid of an evil house . We're talking starting a horrible fire , bulldozing , flood , etc . But a mirror ? How hard could it be can it be to get rid of a mirror ? ! This was the most horrible movie that could've put the title of Amityville into the picture ! Well , a group of friends who are pretty much from the start , are a bunch of freaks . One of them is a photographer of some kind and buys a haunted mirror from a homeless creepy guy , teaching me a valuable lesson , don't buy things from homeless creepy guy . Of course , the horrible deaths and chaos ensues this group , though I can't imagine anyone missing them . Please , skip Amityville : A New Generation , I've already got a few complaints about my generation , so I think this was a premonition . Not to sound so crazy . : P But believe me , this is horribly acted , not well thought out , and not even scary ! I feel so bad for the original writers of The Amityville Horror , they must be crying every time person witnesses this film .
You know how I said I'd rather have a root canal than watch The Grudge , well for the sequel , add two cavities on top of that	My friends and I have a little tradition every Wednesday night , we watch a movie either in the theater or we rent something and this time my friend rented The Grudge 2 , I found out that he never saw the first , so maybe that's why . Because the first Grudge was one of the worst and most boring movies I have ever seen . But I decided to be nice and sit down through the movie and wipe a clean slate for this film , still , it did me no good , because it seems like the plot got only worse along with the crummy actors . Basically , Karen is now in a hospital and has been accused of setting the fire to the house that was from the first film , so her mom sends her sister , Aubrey , to Japan to bring Karen back home to America . But Aubrey finds herself into something deeper when Karen dies from an apparent " suicide " , but when a journalist tells Aubrey that the house is cursed , they decide to play detective while others all around the world are being haunted as well . The acting was pretty bad and the story could have been something more but it didn't work . I normally say for most movies that you have to judge for yourself , but believe me , you might want to stick by the user's comments . Not to mention that if you were not into the first film , you'll definitely not enjoy this one . It just didn't work with the teenagers and I'm sure Japan is already ticked off at us enough for making these movies .
Dear Mariah Carey , You Rock ! Love , Mariah Carey	OK , I just had to see it , I don't know why , but you know how when you see a movie on the bottom 100 , you're just so curious if the movie really is that bad ? I remember back in 2001 how Mariah Carey was trying to so hard to be on top of the world , have a record and movie reach number 1 in one year , but everyone knew this was a typical movie where a pop star should just really stick to their day job . I don't know why Mariah thought this was a good idea , it's just so typical . Now granted , I do believe this was a bad movie , but as far as bottom 100 goes . . . I don't think it was that extremely bad , it's better than most pop star trying to be a movie star movies like In the Cut . Glitter is just poorly written and has bad actors in it , that's what makes it so unbearable to watch and makes Mariah look incredibly desperate for everyone's approval . Billie Frank was put into a foster home as a child when her mother lost the house to a fire , Billie grows up and becomes a back up singer in a group . But when a local DJ , Dice , hears Billie's voice , he wants to get her to sing his songs and become a power house sensation in the music world . They engage in a romance together and everything seems to go well when she is finally exposed and then gets exploited . But of course it starts to get into the way of her and Dice's relationship and she begins to realize the pain and sacrifices she must make in order to make it big . Glitter is just a cheesy movie , it doesn't do any harm , that's the reason for the merciful rating I'm giving it . But I'm just really surprised by Terrence Howard who is an incredible actor and he did this crummy movie . But then again we have Al Pacino in Gigli , it's one of those scary stories of life where if the money is good , what the heck , let's get the big star in it . Mariah looked so uncomfortable on camera and did a horrible job of acting . I feel bad because I'm just complaining so much about this movie , but if you're looking for a cheesy movie , I'd recommend Glitter , but it's torture on the brain , it made mine hurt that's for sure when I thought of all the money that was wasted on this box office flop .
OK , I think this is Freddy's 6th death already	Freddy's Dead : The Final Nightmare , the sixth installment of the Nightmare on Elm Street series and once again another bad sequel . I think this is tied up with the last sequel of the Dream Child . I was lucky enough to get the Nightmare on Elm Street series box DVD set for my birthday , so I got to see all the sequels . May I say that I'm just getting more and more disappointed though with these sequels , at least the past two , it just seems like Freddy lost his edge . It's almost like the writers were trying to give Freddy a soul and they're just destroying it instead of reinventing the story . This was a sequel that wasn't needed , sorry to Robert Englund , but this was very much below what Freddy Krueger represents . Freddy is back , but he's got something we don't know about , a daughter . Maggie , she's not aware that he is her father , but soon she finds out what his dark secrets are and he wants her help . She has to do her best to resist his powers , but it's hard with all the good memories she has of her loving father . Ironic , isn't it ? But Freddy isn't giving up without manipulating her into his ways . Freddy's Dead : The Final Nightmare is also presented in 3-D , radical , huh ? Note the sarcasm . This is one of the worst sequels , it's tied up with the fifth sequel of the Nightmare on Elm Street series , I'd rather watch the second Nightmare on Elm Street to be honest . This just had bad acting , stupid editing , and just over all a bad idea for a story . I didn't like the concept of it and it just ruined the whole idea of who Freddy Krueger really is , the death master of nightmares , not Father Knows Best .
Yeah , it was pretty " corny " : - P	I was at the video store and while I swore off seeing any more of the Children of the Corn sequels , I have to admit that I was intrigued when I saw the cover of Children of the Corn : Revelation , it looked like an actual scary movie . Who knew ? It might've been , right ? I think somewhere on it's own , it might have been a good horror flick , but it got to be too cheesy and the lines were just silly and predictable . A girl , Jamie , is looking for her grandmother , since she hasn't returned her phone calls and has moved into a condemned building . But when she bumps into two creepy looking kids , she begins to wonder what's going on . She goes to the police , but they tell her to wait a day to make sure her grandmother isn't just out , she does so , but ends up finding out more with a certain cult and it's mysterious murders going on in the building she's living in . It was very predictable and incredibly corny , if it didn't have the Children of the Corn title , it could've worked a little better , because the cornstalks were just a little too tacky . But I think some horror fans might get a certain kick out of it , or not , judging by the rating of this film , I think everyone else agrees with me .
Makes for a great comedy	Actually , I liked Jaws : The Revenge for one good reason : I just couldn't stop laughing . Unfortunately , I don't think that was what the director was aiming for . Who knew that sharks could roar ? Or come up out of the water so many times ? My mom and I watched this movie together and we were having fun with the beginning where Sean has to get the log out of the water , we were coming up with how the shark probably put it there and called the secretary to get Sean in the water . This movie was a complete insult / slap to the face for the original . But like I said this movie was great for a laugh and I even recommended putting it in the comedy section at Hollywood Video , the guy agreed with me . If you enjoyed this movie and thought it was a good HORROR flick , oh , man , do I feel sorry for you .
Oh , my head hurts	I was kinda looking forward to Man of the Year , a couple girls at my work said it was a pretty good movie , and my mom said that she liked it , so I waited for the rental , and watched it last night . I have to honestly say that this movie was a huge disappointment . I barely made through it , because to be honest the beginning was pretty good and very well paced , but then it got too dark and not into the movie I saw from the trailer . It looked like a good comedy , then it turned into a very dark drama , that wasn't even that interesting , considering how many of these types of stories we've had about government conspiracy . Tom Dobbs is a very popular comedian with a top ranks show and has an act where many people would want him to get involved with politics , just because it seems like he has a good grip on what should be improved . So he does it , he runs for presidency , but many people doubt that he can win due to the fact that he's a comedian , but he does win ! But Elenore Green who makes sure all the votes are accounted for tries to fix a computer glitch , but when the government tells her not to fix it , they try to get rid of her , and Tom soon realizes that this may not be the job he wanted . The acting was fine , the direction was OK , it was just the story that didn't work in my opinion . Like I said , it just turned into a dramatic change of genres , because if you see the trailer , you'd think it was a comedy , and when you start watching it , that's what you get , but then it just turns into a very dark and somewhat scary drama . I wouldn't really recommend this movie , it was one of the biggest disappointments I have seen so far .
Same plot , different cover	I have stated before how much I hate romantic comedies , at least the one's that are the same concept over and over again , just different actors , but I had a chance to see Made of Honor for free today and I figured , why not ? I mean , the thing is that you really have to give movies a chance , sometimes , you never know , your doubts are put behind you and you find yourself enjoying the movie . I mean , I love Patrick Dempsey and Michelle Monaghan , both great actors and are a lot of fun to watch on screen . So together it seemed like this movie might have stood a chance , but unfortunately once again , this is the exact same movie that we've seen five million times . I know that to people who haven't seen the romantic comedy genre , this is new , but Hollywood is just running out of idea's sadly . This story is no different from any other romantic comedy we've seen . Tom and Hannah have been best friends since college , Tom is the player who has had every girl , except Hannah . She has feelings for him , but hides it and he doesn't notice , but when she goes to Scotland for work , he realizes how much she means to him out of no where . Hannah comes back , but she's got a new thing going on , she's engaged , and Tom's plan to tell her how he feels is now ruined when she asks him to be her maid of honor . But Tom figures that he has a good chance to point out that she doesn't know her fiancée that well and that her and Tom " truely " belong together . The thing is , you can predict every moment before you know it's going to happen , it's sad when you could write a similar script , and just put different actors in it , there is a good chance that people will fall for it , at least it's good to have that kind of chance at making money . Made of Honor isn't the most horrible movie by any means , it had good intentions , but I would recommend if you really want to see it , just wait for the rental . As cute as Patrick and Michelle are , the chemistry is off and the script is just amateur . You've seen this movie five million times , believe me if you're into the romantic comedy genre .
Great , Beethoven meets the Prince and the Pauper	Like I said before , my cousins and I had a Beethoven night , I was looking forward to the sequels , but after the sadness that was the third Beethoven , I had something even more to look forward too . Somehow , Beethoven is still with the brand new Newtons , I guess George , Alice , and their kids were looking for some kind of good excuse to get rid of Beethoven . Basically , Beth and Richard want to get rid of Beethoven due to poor habits of drooling and destroying , but the kids want to keep him so they secretly take Beethoven to obedience classes . But Richard finds out that Beethoven inspires him to create his best art pieces ever . There is another family who is more wealthy and also have a St . Bernard , Michaelangelo , and kidnappers want him so they can get a ransom , not that much money if you ask me , but Beethoven and Michaelanglo get mixed up when they're both outside and end up with the wrong families . Beethoven's 4th is a pretty sorry excuse for a film , but it was a little better than the third Beethoven movie . My cousins really enjoy these films , so like I said before , these films must be doing something right . For a family film , it wouldn't be too bad , but for me , this was a pretty silly movie .
It was alright	When I first saw the trailer for Drillbit Taylor , I thought it actually looked like fun and would be a cool movie , but I decided to save the money and wait for the rental on it , because it was getting some bad reviews . So I did rent it , watched it last night , I'm actually glad I waited for the rental because while I didn't hate the movie , I wasn't a big fan of it . I think because the story was just beyond unrealistic , I know it's a comedy , and I always do lighten up for a movie , but this just seemed ridicules . These boys who are getting picked on , I mean , they're not just getting picked on they're are getting brutally humiliated and somehow no one notices ? Not to mention that a homeless guy can just walk into a school wearing a tie and he is assumed to be a substitute and no one asks questions ? This script must have been written by someone who was drunk . Three kids at school are getting brutally picked on by two bullies , they're getting hit constantly , being made fun of , getting stuffed into trophy cabinets , and even getting hung from doors ; they've had it , they decide to hire a body guard to protect them . They meet Drillbit Taylor , an actual homeless guy who is trying to get to Canada , so he's ripping off these kids in any way he can to get there , but he promises them that he's a great body guard and will teach them how to fight . Of course madness ensues , he ends up liking the kids , the story speaks for itself , I'm sorry . The movie is unoriginal , the comedy is alright , the actors , I wasn't impressed with the casting . I just feel like this movie could have been so much more , it just seems so beyond insane to me to believe a lot of these situations . Not to mention , the bully , he was kinda puny , and I was supposed to believe him as a bully who can kick anyone's butt ? I know that everyone is going to tell me to lighten up with this movie , but honestly , I feel like it did waste my time , it was predictable and not comedy gold , I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone to be honest .
Surfing Vampires : Hang Fang	The Lost Boys , as cheesy as it sounds , is seriously one of my favorite movies , without a doubt my favorite vampire film , it's sexy , stylish , and really stands out against a lot of other vampire movies . Now it's been a famous cult classic for 21 years , people are still discovering it to this day , now there had been rumors for so many years about a sequel , that it was going to be Lost Girls , David and his gang would return , that the Frog Brothers go to Washinton , D . C . The list goes on and on , finally after 21 long years , we have a new sequel for the cult classic , Lost Boys : The Tribe . I couldn't resist , I automatically bought it curious and thinking that it might be worth the watch , oh , dear , how I want my twenty dollars back . I was incredibly disappointed , and frankly disturbed with some of the character's behavior as well as a very lame story . Chris and Nicole have moved to a new town with their aunt , after dealing with their parent's death , they're feeling down . Chris sees Shane , a once famous surfer who disappeared out of the spot light , he invites Chris to a party . Chris and Nicole go to the party , everything seems normal , until Nicole walks with Shane to his room and she drinks his blood out of a flask , she is now becoming a vampire . Chris seeks the help of our old friend , Edgar Frog , 150 pounds , about 5 foot 2 , and still acts like Rambo times a thousand with the one liners . They try to help Nicole and destroy the surfing vampires before it's too late for her . Lost Boys : The Tribe is seriously a major let down considering this movie could have been so much more . Sadly , Sam makes a 2 minute appearance that was a huge let down , as well as Allen doesn't even make the final cut , only in the alternate ending . I wish the director wasn't reading " How to make a film for dummies " while making this movie , because he didn't have an ounce of respect that the first Lost Boys had . It doesn't have the attitude or class to hold a candle up to the first film . This isn't the worst sequels I've seen , over all on it's own , it is kind of worth the look , but after Edgar's 100th one liner , it was turning into an episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer . Fans of the first Lost Boys beware , I just had to learn the hard way . . . 20 dollars ! ! ! I could've gotten groceries , I gave up a week's worth of food for this .
" The good guys are here ! "	LOL , that just summed up the whole movie , didn't it ? So last night I was looking for a movie to watch and in my mom's collection I found " Air Force One " and I noticed that Harrison Ford was in it , so I figured I would give it a look . So I watched it and all I can say is American Propaganda much ? Now I'm all American , don't get me wrong , I love my country , but this was a bit much and incredibly insulting . If we really had a president like James Marshall , played by Ford , I'd say America would be a very exciting place of nothing but none-stop action . The whole movie either took itself too seriously or then would get into an Arnold Schwartzenegger type of action movie where Ford would say that little one liner before the big climax . Oh , I loved the 25 endings of how they could keep the action going . Now I love action movies , don't get me wrong , but this story was just silly and unnecessary . President James Marshell is on the fight of stopping terrorism , Russian terrorism to be more specific . Well he boards his flight back to the states , Air Force One starts off well , but is quickly hijacked by Ivan Korshunov and his men , terrorists who want their General Radek released from prison in return for the passengers on board , which isn't good since I guess he was hard to capture and is a deadly terrorist . Ivan makes threats to kill of the passengers every half hour if the vice president does not meet his demands . But the President does not chicken out , he stays on board and will fight these terrorists and win back the plane . Air Force One is non-stop action with a mixture of the hit TV show West Wing . Like I said , I don't mind an action movie , sometimes I love the most cliché'd one's , but not when it comes to serious stuff like terrorism , but I think I'm speaking from a post view , so maybe if I saw this movie a before then , I wouldn't have mind it that much , but even then , there were moments that were terribly over acted and for me , it just didn't work for having a president like James Marshall , please , I wish . I can't wait to see President Bush on top of a tanker sporting a look like Rambo , but I guess I shouldn't hold my breath .
Utterly Depressing	Best screenplay , no , really didn't even need a nomination . Best actress , NO ! Halle , she's a great actress , but this was not best actress worthy . And so not worth her raving speech as if she had broken all berriors for black actresses in Hollywood . I might have agreed with the nomination , but I've seen way too many actresses at the Oscars who deserved the Oscar getting passed on because of their rep or age . Halle is young , but I think the Oscars felt more like she needed this Oscar instead of earning it . The story of Monster's Ball has no point and could have gone on for hours . Both Halle and Bill's character went no where . It's like most movies have the characters go from point A to point B , but not in Monster's Ball . I think also the two sons in the beginning were like trash to the script writer , when it's at it's fullest , throw it out ! I just didn't feel that much after this movie was done . I'm sorry , but this was not that good of a movie .
As a sequel , it's lame , as a movie , not too bad	I saw Return to House on Haunted Hill on sale the other day and figured to just check it out . For 8 bucks , what did I have to loose ? I watched the film last night and over all , I'd say it wasn't too bad , I've seen a thousand times worse . The only major complaint , was the lesbian sex scene really necessary ? Like , what did that have to do with the story at all ? It's not like it was even realistic , it was some sick director's fantasy , because they are drop dead gorgeous girls who are moving like a porno film , it was just ridicules . The effects were actually kinda cool though , like the scene where the guy was torn apart by the ghosts was visually very cool to look at . The CGI is a little much , but to be honest , I'm at that point where I'm giving up and just accepting it , so I'm going to let go the over the top stuff go , but it's a cool horror story . Ariel's sister just supposedly killed herself and has a secret about the haunted hill house , there is a statue in there that is worth millions . Leading us to the " bad guys " who are in it for the money and are using Ariel and her boyfriend to the house to get it . But they meet a professor and his student who are also after the statue , leading like Indiana Jones , and claims the statue should be in a museum . But understandably Ariel just wants to get out of there , but the house won't let her . Return to House on Haunted Hill is not too bad , really . I'd say there is a good amount of scares and the story is decent enough , it's not your typical bad bad sequel that I expected . Would I recommend it to anyone ? Not too many people , I think you'll have to see yourself , and be in a good mood to see a horror movie . Otherwise if you take the time to watch this , don't take it too seriously , because you are going to hate it . Gotta love the boy fantasy of having three women together naked and moving like a porno movie .
Very strange , but not terrible	My friend and I were looking for a movie to see in the theater yesterday , everything I saw she didn't ad everything she saw I didn't , but one movie we didn't see was I Know Who Killed Me . We never heard of it , we actually for a minute didn't wanna see it because Lindsay Lohan was in it , but eventually we were just like " What the heck ? " . We needed a couple hours to kill and had free movie tickets that we got as a gift . So after seeing I Know Who Killed Me , I just was thinking of how much of a strange movie this was , but at the same time I didn't think it was all that bad , there were some things left unexplained and the ending was pretty lame , but I think over all , this was a thriller with good potential and just needed a little pick-me-up . Aubrey is a good girl who has strong potential to be a good writer and piano player , she has a good life , good home , loving parents , good friends , and a loving boyfriend . One night though , she is kidnapped and brutally tortured . Someone finds her on the road , but when Aubrey is picked up and taken to the hospital , she says she's not Aubrey , she's Dakota Moss , a stripper with a dirty life who has no idea what's going on , but she's not Aubrey . Is this a story that she's believing too much ? Is this a possible side effect from being traumatized ? Is this something from the drugs the killer was making her take ? Or is she even right ? Is it a possibility that she really isn't Aubrey ? Everyone calls her crazy and just tries to make her believe that she is Aubrey , but Dakota searches for the truth and wants answers . Like I said , I Know Who Killed Me turned out to be a little surprise of a film , I liked it personally , there were things that were confusing , but over all I think the plot kept me guessing and going . Lindsay I would say did a good job , but the strip scenes at times were a little too much , just because we all know her personal life , so I think it would make us a little uncomfortable . There are some flaws to the film , but I wouldn't say to stay away , just keep your mind open and you might find yourself liking it .
Nice	Honestly , I did have a feeling from the trailer that Fly Me to the Moon wasn't going to exactly my style . But I had the opportunity to see it today for free and I just wanted to give it a fair chance , I don't know what's with this year , but it doesn't seem like all the animated films are gold , now we had WALL-E and Kung Fu Panda , that's about it when it comes to the good animated films , but then we had Space Chimps and now Fly Me to the Moon that are just average . See , what bugs me is that this movie is just for kids , I think we should have those kind of films , but this was semi-boring . The humor didn't even seem to exist , also flies are not cute or interesting to watch and just because a film is made for 3-D doesn't make it a great film . I'm not trying to hate on this film because the story is decent , it's just the way it's told that makes it a little dull . Nat , I . Q . , and Scooter are young flies who are just day dreamers , but Nat dreams of going to the moon one of these days . When he talks to his adventurous grandfather , he decides to just go for it . He talks I . Q . and Scoother into it as well , they sneak onto the rocket ship that is taking Americans to the moon for the first time . But with the mothers freaking out at home and Russian flies who can't stand the idea of these American flies getting the credit , it may not be a happy trip home . Fly Me to the Moon is alright for the kids under 7 , that's it . Like I said , I think we should have movies that are aimed for kids only , but this was just dull and didn't interest me . The humor is very tame and the characters aren't the best to relate too . There are a couple of nice things about the movie , like the animation is beautiful and the story is fun . Even though 3-D doesn't make a movie wonderful , it does make it a lot of fun to watch and a lot more interesting to look at . Over all , I'd say to see this as a matinée if you want to see it on the 3-D screen , otherwise , it's a rental , there's nothing special about it , but it's a nice movie .
It wasn't bad , just lacked substance	I was honestly expecting total trash when I started watching Get Rich or Die Trying ' , I'm going to be honest with you , I hate rap music . I think it's extremely degrading and insulting to women , all races , and life in general , so I obviously steered away from 50 Cent and his " music " . But I figured I might give Get Rich or Die Trying ' a shot , I had nothing else to watch , why not see how much of a disaster this film would be ? This film is supposedly based on 50 Cent's life and how hard it was growing up in his neighborhood , he dealt with a lot . My problems that I had with his life , you choose the life that you want , and him being " proud to be a gangsta " is very sad when he could've done so much more . There is so much to question about why Americans are so violent , and this film is making terrible stereotypes , not to mention making more people afraid of African Americans , it's insulting , and I'm a white person ! That's just my thought on the subject and that's why I had a hard time watching this movie , because we need to improve ourselves , big time . But the movie itself seriously isn't as bad as a 3 . 2 rating , I agree that it wasn't a necessary movie , not to mention that it was probably just publicity for 50 Cent , but still , it had a good story , but didn't carry through . The acting was alright , but honestly , I don't know who told rappers they could also act , but I'd really like to meet that person , because most rappers should stick to their day job instead of trying to make everyone feel sorry for them . Choose the right path , and you won't come out to look like such a punk who will be taken seriously .
Eh . . .	I was watching " Boogeymen " and when this movie clip called " Wishmaster " poped up I thought " Hey , it looks pretty good " . So , I went out and rented it . Boy , do I wish I didn't . Now , it's not horrible . But it's just a way to kill a hour and a half . I'm not sure what it was that didn't impress me . I guess the characters were a little annoying . I just WISH I didn't see this film . I could've saved $3 .
Sex , sex , and more sex ?	It seemed like this movie was just an excuse for a director's fantasy to come true with catholic school girls . But anyways , the movie is a little strange . I'm not sure if I enjoyed it , but I was in the mood for gory fun . So , if you are ever in that mood , then watch it .
The Lion King meets Madagascar	I have been dying to see The Wild , but I basically had to track it down since I couldn't find it at my lovely Hollywood Video store , lucky enough I found it at a little video store called Blockbuster . : P It just looked like a fun film and I unfortunately never got to see the movie in the theater , so I had to wait for the rental . Over all , I'd say that The Wild was a pretty good family film , but seemed like it could've been a better story . Samson and Ryan are the main attraction at the zoo , the lions ! Well , Ryan is a cub who is finding it very hard to find his great roar ! He wants to see what the wild is like from the stories his dad told him , one night he and his dad get into a big fight and Ryan , in anger , gets on a crate heading for the wild , but realizes he shouldn't have and ends up trapped . Samson and his group of friends head to the wild to find Ryan and end up discovering that they have no idea what they're doing ! I did like The Wild , and I know that it was made before Madagascar , but I think I liked Madagascar better , or at least it was funnier . But still , I wouldn't shy away from The Wild , it just could've been presented a little better I think . But it's a great cast , terrific animation , and in general a good family film .
Over all , I'd say to give this movie a shot	I know the critics panned this movie and there are a few people out there who despise this movie , but over all I think I enjoyed Elizabethtown . Now , I do believe the writing has it's flaws and a lot of Kirsten's character's charistics are unbelievable , it also ended unbelievably too . I mean , it's always the classic , " Love conquers all " type of flick , but I think we need that once in a while . In today's society , let's face it , love is something everyone wants but can't get . At least the right kind of love and everyone wants the love that Orlando and Kirsten had for each other . They just let their love grow and blossom into something beautiful and touching . I think that's why some people bashed this film because it's hard to believe this movie unless situations like this happened more . But I'd say to give the movie a shot and just enjoy .
Nothing new , but it's worth the watch	21 is definitely the major film for the spring time , it has young hot actors , including an incredible academy award winner , Kevin Spacey , and another great actor who's head looks like it grew quite a bit bigger , Lawarence Fishburne . So it has all the key ingredients for a good movie , a decent plot , over all a good combination of actors , and looks like a well put together movie . So I saw it this weekend and I have to say that I was a little disappointed , I think this movie was more for the teenagers , with the actors and the rating , I think it should've been more adult . It was a typical rise and fall story with cliché'd characters . Kevin Spacey , seriously my favorite actor , he's always a dead on hit with every role he takes on , but he seemed to just sleep his way through the film and didn't really care about it . He and new and hot up-comer , Jim Sturgess were not a bad couple on screen , but were not strong enough to hold the story into something original . Basically we have Ben Campbell who needs $300 , 000 for Harvard Med . School , he's extremely gifted with numbers , so when his professor , Micky Rosa notices his gifts , he invites Ben with a group of his other students to go to Vegas and play 21 . But there is a way to beat the game apparently , by counting cards . Ben promises up and down that it is just for school , but of course when he gets so hot , he takes it way further and ends up making a huge mistake and gets caught with some nasty security guards you don't wanna mess with . Now 21 has decent enough acting , the movie itself is decent , I didn't mind at all watching it . For the most part , it's the young group of students that keep the movie interesting and keeps your attention . My main problems are for example about the characters Ben and Jill hooking up , I seriously doubt that would happen for real , but for the movie , they want these two hotties to get together at least for the teenage audience's sake . Also supposedly the group says they have to stay on the down low in Vegas so they don't get caught , yet they go around Vegas buying all these new clothes , clubbing , drinking , etc . 21 is worth the watch , but to be honest , if you're reading this , wait for the rental , it's just a regular rise and fall story .
When did IMDb become so cynical ? This is a kid's movie for goodness sake !	Honestly , I can't help but notice all the people who once again are rating this movie without seeing it and just because they suspect the movie is going to be bad , they rate it anyways as a one . Well , I'm going to once again give you an honest review , I saw this movie last Saturday and honestly enjoyed it . I know I'm going to receive a lot of bashing , but I always look at movies as what they are supposed to be , this was meant to be a children's movie , it's meant for fun . Remember how we all had those cheesy animal movies when we were kids as well ? Well Beverly Hills Chihuahua is no different , it's just updated with today's world . I thought it was a good idea , we see all these rich people now-a-days with the way they just lavish their dogs with jewels that cost more than people's houses , it takes a little joke at it . The story is recycled , but it's still a lot fun to watch and has some really fun scenes . Chloe is a Beverly Hills Chihuahua who is just so pampered , with clothes , jewelery , and a life style anyone would die to have . Her owner , Vivian , has to go away on a business trip and leaves her party girl niece , Rachel , to watch Chloe . When they go to Mexico , Chloe is kidnapped and put into a dog fight . . . she is then saved by another dog , Delgado , who is going to help her get back to Beverly Hills . But when the man who runs the dog fights finds out that Chloe is worth something , he sends his Doberman dog , Diablo , after her . Rachel , the land scaper , Sam , and his dog , Pepi who is also in love with Chloe , are on the hunt to find her and get her home safe and sound . Beverly Hills Chihuahua is a fun movie if you give it a decent chance , I thought it was a nice chance from the constant CGI we always have with these animal stories . I was also impressed that the talking didn't look so fake with the dogs . I tell you though I'm convinced that the dog that played Delgado is the same dog from I Am Legend , that dog just deserves an Oscar , lol , come on , you gotta agree . Well , Beverly Hills Chihuahua is a great family film , as for seeing it on your own or with a friend , I would say that it's worth the rental more so . It's a silly movie I admit , but I had a fun time watching it and I wish IMDb users would give this movie the fair chance it deserves .
An average horror / thriller flick	Mr . DeNiro , Bob , my future sugar daddy , the actors of all actors , what has happened ? You're still great , but I mean , this was just too average and not in your league at all . Sorry , I had to get that out . I'm very disappointed , everyone at my work told me that this was a great movie , and I wasn't that excited to tell the truth . These past few years we've released some " big surprise twist ending " movies : The Sixth Sense ( good movie ) , The Others ( pretty decent ) , Signs ( Alright ) , and The Village ( bad bad bad ! ) . Now , not that I'm totally upset with this flick , I mean Dakota is becoming a fine actress . We have to admit , she is very talented for her age . She's very believable and cute to watch . But a lot of this movie leads up to nothing and has nothing to be excited or jumpy over . It has a story , but it wasn't delivered right . I mean , this is an A-cast : Robert DeNiro , Elizabeth Shue , and Amy Irving . I guess it just wasn't that interesting to me . If you enjoy these surprise thrillers , you probably enjoy it . But if you've seen one surprise ending thriller , you've seen them all , right ? I should take my own stupid advice .
A nice little movie	This is an honest piece of work . I'm not sure why I really chose to watch this when I borrowed it from a friend , but it looked cute . And it was . It didn't really catch my 100 % attention , but most of the time I enjoyed it . It had a great cast and a cool story . To be honest , I didn't even realize that this was a true story , but I wondered because it sounded familular . It is a bit clique , but has little twists here and there . It brought me back to back to a more peaceful time that I wish was still here to this day . When music wasn't about hate or teenage things , but peace and fun and dancing . I would recommend this movie for a rainy weekend inside . It's a fun and cute movie to watch .
Ooooo , scary , zzzzzzzzzz ! I'm scared , really , yeah . . . .	" The Skeleton Key " , I didn't really have an interest in seeing it , but one of my roommates rented it and asked me to join in . I figured why not give it a shot . While it was better than what I expected , it still was pretty predictable . I will give that over all , it's not a bad movie , it's pretty decent . Kate Hudson , from chick flicks to " shocking " thrillers . Surprisingly she does well , but the problem wasn't her . The problem was her character , she was so under developed and not written well . It was pretty cliché , she hides in the attic before Violet , the elderly lady who owns the house , can come up to see what she's been sneaking through . First off , Caroline ( Kate Hudson ) , is supposed to live there , so if I were her , I would've just said I wanted to see more of the house . She acted way too suspicious in the first part of the movie . It's like she went into the house expecting for their to be something wrong . Despite Violet not giving her a chance at first , I mean , it's typical . You'd expect that from an elderly woman to a young lady , nothing to get shocked over . Also , what happened to Ben ? I think I figured it out that it was originally supposed to be that lawyer estate guy in him , but they could've specified more . The plot is typical and nevertheless predictable , but still watchable . There are some plot holes and questions that are left unanswered . The ending is better and more realistic than most thrillers . I won't give it away , but you should see for yourself . If you enjoy thrillers , I think you might enjoy it , if you've seen one though , you've seen them all , right ?
Actually , I thought it was kind of boring	When it comes to Dracula movies , especially the classics , I always jump on it . My mother had bought the Christopher Lee Dracula movies when I was younger and even though I kind of enjoyed Dracula when I was a kid , today I would sleep through it . Yes , it's the first brilliant installment into the Hammer's collection of Dracula films and Christopher's first time being the character . I am a little surprised by the decent rating , yes , true , this is a good classic , it's still slow paced and doesn't really add to the Dracula stories . It stays close to Bram Stroker's novel , but felt a little off at times . Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee are remarkable actors , don't get me wrong , just again why people found this Dracula to be sheer entertainment is a wonder to me because it's just nothing special . During Lucy's staking , I just felt like they could have just uped the action just a little bit . You're telling me that during all these scenes you were on the edge of your seat ? The only really exciting scenes to me were when Jonathan is attacked by Dracula's female vampire and you see Dracula by the door way with blood all over his teeth , it scarred me to death when I was little . Then the final battle between Van Helsing and Dracula was huge for me , those were cool special effects . Like I said though , it just didn't move me . The only interest I really had in this movie TODAY is Peter and Christopher's acting abilities . They worked so well together and brought excitement to horror pictures . Otherwise , I wouldn't really recommend this movie , to me it's just boring and not that important unless you want to see the whole Hammer's Dracula collection with Christopher Lee .
Oh , god , I can't believe I'm saying this . . . I actually had fun . . . did I just really write that ? Maybe I should make a doctor's appointment	OK , I work at a movie theater and the main thing we've been waiting for is High School Musical 3 : Senior Year , we knew it was going to be big , so a few co-workers and I got together for the matinée before all the kids rushed in , it was still packed surprisingly . But I've seen both previous films because my little cousin is just in love with all that pre-teen hoop-la , it's all good , every generation has something so lovey-dovey-cutesee-wootsee type of thing . But one of the things that made this film enjoyable was to see all the kids who were just participating with this film , I mean , I felt like I was in a concert , the kids were clapping with the songs , screaming for their idols , and just having fun , it was cool to see their reactions , to remember a more innocent time of being in love that much with something . But I felt like this was just a cute movie that is getting too much criticism just because it is High School Musical , give it a break and take it for what it is . The gang is back for their senior year and everything is just perfect , they came up with a great idea for a musical to represent all that they're going through in this exciting year . But there is also a lot of pressure : Zack is facing a tough decision of which college to go to while Gabriella is planning on going to Yale University so far away from him , Sharpay and her brother , Ryan , are competing for a scholarship to Juliard , and Chad and Taylor are learning what to do with the rest of their lives while loosing their best friends to different schools . Granted High School Musical is never Oscar material , in fact , it's downright like having a soda after school with the hot quarterback or sexy cheerleader , but like I said , it's for the kids . Seeing their reactions to this reminded me and my co-workers of a more innocent time , when I had the same excitement to see Spice World when I was 12 years old . We all had these silly things we loved at a young age and for some reason we become more cynical as we get older criticizing everything that the new generation has , so I'm cutting this movie some slack . It had fun songs , cute characters , silly situations , but great dance numbers and is just over all a nice film for the family . I do recommend it just for the fun of being with the fans and just having a good time , no matter how cheesy it is .
It's enjoyable at times , but seems to lack as well	I just saw 28 days , and I have heard so much about this film , it's insane . I've seen it on so many IMDb user's reviews and my sister was just talking about this film a few days ago . She mentioned that Steve Buchemi was in the film , so I figured that I would give this film a shot . While 28 Days was a pretty good film , it didn't quite capture me as well as Girl , Interrupted did . I guess because it seemed like the script writers were pointing us into two directions with some different situations and the ending just seemed to well , end . Basically , Gwen is an alcoholic that unfortunately has ruined her sister's wedding and gets into a bad car accident forcing her to either go to jail or rehab , she choose rehab , but realizes that it might be too cheesy for her to handle , so after some resistance , she finally realizes that it's now or never and just deals with it , but learns that she has good friends and is finally discovering who she truly is . Well , the plot with Gwen and Eddie just seemed to point us in different directions , while Eddie in some ways helped Gwen out , I don't think his character was absolutely needed . But it was kind of a nice touch with Gwen bumping into her friend at the plant shop , in some ways it was just so realistic and touching to see that one last smile . Over all though , I could honestly say that I would recommend this movie for a watch , but don't expect Oscar material .
Nothing special , nothing memorable , but it's cute for the kids	When I saw the trailer for Space Chimps , I honestly thought it looked cute and fun , also they mentioned that it was made by the same folks who did Shrek , so I figured that it was going to be gold . I was first off a little surprised that it didn't do so hot at the box office , not only that , but it has a pretty low rating here on IMDb . I was thinking how this movie was probably awful , but how could it be ? It's an animation film , so I still wanted to see it , I checked it out today and honestly , it's not a 4 . 4 rating movie , I think people are being a little too harsh on it . I agree that it's nothing special , but it's a cute movie that had it's moments . Opening the same weekend as The Dark Knight and Mamma Mia , we needed a good hearted film for the family as well , and Space Chimps does deliver on that . Ham is a chimp who is the grandson of a famous chimp astronaut who was the first chimp in space . When there is possible life found on another planet , three scientists decide to experiment and instead of risking human life , the send out the chimps including Ham to space to find the alien life form . Ham , Luna , and Titon are sent out into space , but Ham isn't taking it seriously , constantly joking around , hitting on Luna , Titon constantly taking credit for everything . When they do land on the planet , they meet some interesting creatures and have to save the planet since one alien , Zartog , wants to take over . Space Chimps isn't a bad movie , it's just nothing special , I'd recommend waiting for the rental . It's a cute movie thought for the little ones . But I did enjoy a few scenes , I loved the line Titon says to Ham " Are you David Bowie ? " . . . you'll have to see what I mean , but there are some cute and fun moments . The animation is so-so , the voices are decent , except some moments seemed a little stereotypical and cliché . But as a family kid movie , I would say that this is a go , just don't expect anything like Shrek .
A little slow paced if you ask me	While I admit gladly that this was a really entertaining story and Bill and Ben work so well together , for some reason this just wasn't to me an good movie to watch . I also definitely fell asleep on it twice , which is a bad sign in my case . Bill plays a detective who is trying to figure out a blackmailer and where a tycoon's keys are . But unfortunately for him his partner played by Ben Stiller , he wants to quit and settle down with his girlfriend . Also , Bill happens to fall in love with the blackmailer from what I understand and it gets in the way , big time . Not my type of movie , it was kind of boring to me . I know that IMDb users will not find this comment useful , that's OK . I don't want to spend a paragraph on why I didn't enjoy the movie , you're just going to have to take my word on it .
Again , like the first one , it's not too good	Throw in some cameos and what do you have ? A desperate attempt to draw the audience in . I'm not impressed . Just read my review on the first one , because if you were not into the first Men In Black , you'll never amount to this one . Again , because the song is catchy .
These special effect guys have played one too many video games	I was never really into the Blade movies or stories from the comic books , but my mom is a huge fan . We have a Pomeranian , and I remember her calling me and screaming about how Blade : Trinity had a vampire Pomeranian in it , I just started laughing and couldn't believe it . But she kept on asking me to watch it with her , because no one else would , so finally I sat down and watched it , and I couldn't believe my eyes , a vampire Pomeranian ! Blade has been set up by humans who were pretending to be vampires , so now everyone thinks he is a murderer and has become the most wanted man in America . When the Feds get ahold of him , a group of humans help Blade escape and together they must find Dracula to stop him from creating the ultimate vampire . Of course , you know , that's not going to be easy since Dracula reminds you instead of a smooth talking Romanian as a Predator wanna be ! While Blade : Trinity has some great action like always , it just seems like the whole special effects just revolved around video games of today . But I would recommend Blade : Trinity for vampire lovers , action lovers , or well , you get the idea . I just at least wanted to watch it , because , there is a vampire Pomeranian ! Crazy , I know ! But it was so cool to see and I will never doubt my mom again .
And then there was Jason	Friday the 13th Part 2 : sequel number 2 in the Friday the 13th series and not too bad . I'm trying to see what is the big deal with Jason Vorhees really , there are a lot of horror movie fans who are just in love with this guy , I view him as a mama's boy , but I remember do not judge until I have seen all the Friday the 13th films , which means I have a lot of films to watch . Friday the 13th Part 2 finally introduces Jason Vorhees , but he doesn't wear his famous ski mask just yet , just a clothe of some sort . But he has returned to avenge his mother's death and terrorize young , sexy , hormonal teens who are at Camp Crystal Lake once again , you'd think they'd learn after what happened the year before . Ginny and a group of friends are going to try again to reopen Camp Crystal Lake since the killer from last year was decapitated , why not ? But they might wanna change their mind when a big man in a hooded clothe comes to terrorize them and ruin their day . But we discover that it is Jason Vorhees , he's returned from the grave to avenge his death as well as his mother's . The poor and horny teens are brutally slaughtered and it is up to Ginny to get through this horrible night . Friday the 13th Part 2 is over all a pretty fun film , not as good as the first Friday th 13th film , but it's decent enough to give another watch . I really hope the upcoming sequels are just as fun . Although I'm still not too into Jason , it's all good , he still delivers a good scare with the best death scenes . He is big , brutal , and you don't wanna mess with his mama , or he'll come after you . Well , 7 more films to go , I have a feeling this is going to take a while .
Cute and fun , but unfortunately doesn't stand out	Ever since I saw the trailer for The House Bunny back in May , I was looking forward to seeing it , this looked like a fun comedy and we all love Anna Faris , this girl is just adorable , and she makes comedies a lot of fun . So I saw The House Bunny yesterday and I did enjoy myself , but we've done this before , the dumb blonde story , not that we can't do it again , I'm just looking for something a little fresh . But Anna Faris holds herself so well with comedies , The House Bunny , she doesn't seem to enjoy herself as much in this role . A lot of the moments where she acts stupid , she looks a little uncomfortable at times , I think that's why this movie didn't stand out as well as other dumb blonde comedies . But it's mindless entertainment , the message , it worries me a little , I'll explain why in a little bit , but I'd say if you're a grown up and you know better , than this is a fun little movie . Shelley is a hot playboy bunny whose life is just grand , she's a sweetheart , a little on the slow side , but always has good intentions , and when it appears that Hugh Hefner wants her out of the house due to her age of 27 , she must pack up her things and take off . She's homeless , but finds a local sorority that needs a house mother and a clue into a social life . She becomes their house mother and teaches them how to attract people , but she learns a little something too when she meets a sweet , smart , and sensitive guy , Oliver . Now things become a success with the sorority , but they become a little too shallow and Oliver wants more than a playboy bunny , he wants a girl to talk too , and to top that off the other sororities are upset to learn that the former losers are now hotties that everyone loves . My one problem with this movie , even though it is enjoyable , the message isn't appropriate for young girls . I know it's just a movie , I don't want to nit pick , believe me , I know when a movie is harmless , but it's teaching young girls that you have to play yourself down to get a guy and that looks will get you everywhere at any time , also we are rooting for a person who just always has good intentions , why ? That's all Shelley is , just a nice person , but she doesn't have many likable qualities . I liked the movie over all , I just think the script needed more work , nothing about this movie stood out , it's a disappointment to me . I would recommend it for silly fun , but otherwise , just wait for the rental .
Oh , you know , kill this , kill that . It's what Rambo does , right ?	I'm not sure why , but I love watching these old action flicks that are so cliché . I love " Commando " , " Die Hard " , and " Rambo " . They're just fun to watch because of all the typical violence and always winning in the end . I just love always how Arnold , Bruce , and Sylvester are big guys but never get shot , and somehow they can kill over 50 men with one gun . It's just classic . " Rambo : First Blood Part II " takes off in prison where Rambo is paying from his last actions from the first Rambo . Only the general has a new assignment and knows only Rambo could complete it . He just has to take pictures of P . O . W . ' s , a . k . a captured Americans , in Vietnam that are being tortured . Of course him being Rambo , he wants to be a hero and save these guys with a hot Asian chick who knows how to use a gun . Together they fight to save these Americans , but fail the first time due to the guys who we thought were good but turned out to be bad and it causes Rambo to get captured , but of course the girl comes to save him and they escape together where we " discover " they like each other , which cf course can't be good , you just can guess what happens to the girl to lead Rambo into a rampage on the Vietnamese and Russians . This is just too classic and for fun , come on . I mean a 5 . 1 . ? Yeah , it's a cheesy and predictable movie , but I think we can all admit that we've seen worse . It's Rambo , for goodness sakes ! Do you want this guy coming after us ? ! : D OK , I'm sorry , I can be a dork sometimes . But I think this at least deserves a 6 . 0 . Just sit back and enjoy the senseless violence .
While it is indeed an excellent picture and a great story , I wasn't too thrilled	I know that this movie has more than a few fans and the Oscars went crazy for " Good Night and Good Luck " , please don't hate me or think I have bad taste in films , but the movie just didn't excite me much . My mom and I rented this flick with extreme high hopes and I was more gentle on reviews than my mother was , she fell asleep during the movie , but I stuck through it and went with the story . While it's a beautifully made picture and a story that is capturing , this was just not my type of flick . The characters and type of genre just didn't excite me . The whole movie in my opinion was over all just average . I would however , recommend this for anyone because I think it was a very decent picture to at least watch and give a chance too . Again , this is just my opinion , some pictures capture better to some than to others . So , watch and come up with your own opinion .
Twilight ! Twilight ! Oh , my . . . Twiiiiiiiiliaaaaaaaaaaght !	That was my interpretation of this weekend that I had to endure working at my movie theater , all these little hormone crazed brace wearing under developed young girls who I think would've just about died with the anticipation of seeing Twilight , I'm not kidding , I personally witnessed a twelve year old say that she wanted to have Robert Pattinson's baby . OK , so how I saw the movie , my sister , ironically my older sister has been just raving about the Twilight series with her friends and told me that I have to read these books , after weeks of bugging me with it , I finally broke down and read them . Actually it's kind of a fun series , it reminded me of the same love that I had for the TV series Buffy the vampire Slayer when I was a young teen . But of course she has to take me to the midnight premiere with 100 , 000 crazed fans who were knocking each other down and crawling all over each other just to see a movie . Bella Swan has always been a little bit different , never caring about fitting in with the trendy girls at her Phoenix high school . When her mother remarries and sends Bella to live with her father in the rainy little town of Forks , Washington , she doesn't expect much of anything to change . Then she meets the mysterious and beautiful Edward Cullen . Intelligent and witty , he sees straight into her soul . Soon , Bella and Edward are swept up in a passionate and decidedly unorthodox romance . Edward can run faster than a mountain lion , he can stop a moving car with his bare hands - and he hasn't aged since 1918 . Like all vampires , he's immortal . But he doesn't have fangs , and he doesn't drink human blood . So , my opinion about Twilight the movie . . . honestly , it's average , it's my junior high romance with a vampire . I hate , beyond hate to say this , I'm a hypocrite for saying this , but because I read the book before I saw the movie , I had this completely different interpretation of what the characters look like and how they say certain lines . Twilight the movie made me laugh more than anything simply because of the actors , Robert and Kristen are not bad actors , but the way they talked , I just couldn't take their " love " seriously . Peter Facinelli who played Carlisle Cullen , Edward's father , was exactly how I pictured and pulled in the best performance of the film . Is it worth the watch , absolutely if you're a fan of the books , otherwise , I would say if you just wanna see this movie , I recommend the matinée price because honestly , I think I may have lost my hearing after this weekend of the none stop screams from crazed teens .
Creep-ee	I had heard a little bit about The Stepford Wives recently on a TV show , they showed little clips of the movie and I knew I had to see it . I saw the sad thing that they called the remake of the Stepford Wives , wasn't impressed and I think part of that made me want to turn away from the story , but I found the rental and watched it the other day , this movie just creeped me out . I couldn't believe how scary it was , I know that it may seem a bit tame to others , especially in today's world , but I think it was the whole concept and the ending that really got to me . Just think about it , men wanting a " perfect " wife so badly that they'd kill them and replace them with robots ? Just thinking about the subject makes you think and the film makes a clever and well acted cult classic thriller . Joanna and Walter have just moved to Stepford , everything seems just so perfect , a little too perfect , Walter has a great new job with tons of friends , Joanna has made some friends too . Some of the women are normal and are in the women's lib movement , some are just a little to Mrs . Beaver , doing everything that a husband could want : cook , clean , make love constantly , and just keep her mouth shut at certain times . But when things get a little too suspicious when one of Joanna's friends who was with her on the women's movement has become all " Stepford " , she starts to wonder what's really going on . The Stepford Wives is definitely a classic in it's own right and really is a conversation movie . I admit that it's lost a little edge within time , but if you just think about the subject , it really is disturbing , Katherine Ross pulls in a terrific performance , especially in the " I bleed " scene , how scary that must have been for her character , you'll see what I mean . I would recommend this for movie buffs or if you're looking for a creepy thriller to watch , this is a fun classic and is always the perfect joke for our " Stepford " wives of today .
A very touching coming of age story great for any age to watch	I remember seeing the trailer for The Secret Life of Bees and honestly , the movie looked completely different than what I was expecting . I have not read the book , so I wasn't sure what to expect , but after watching The Secret Life of Bees , this story just touched my heart and I felt like this film couldn't have come out at a more perfect time than this year with our first bi-racial president . I think we always could use a history lesson or reminder of how far we have come these few decades . The actors , Queen Latifah and Dakota Fanning both pulled in beautiful performances and really make this film powerful and touching . Another surprise performance that I really enjoyed was Alicia Key's , I've never seen her in film before , but she did a great job . It's a strong drama that holds itself very well and is very heart warming . Lily is a young white girl in the 1960's southern America in the peak of racism . At only 14 years old she has a lot on her shoulders , she accidentally shot and killed her mother when she was just 4 years old , her father is extremely abusive , and her best friend is her black nanny who takes her into town and gets beat by several white men and is arrested for not apologizing afterwards . Lily breaks her out and runs away with her , they ask a black family for hospitality . The head of the house hold , August takes them in despite the suspicions from June and May , the other girls of the house . But Lily soon finds herself surprisingly when she least expected it and now has the most loving family in the world . The Secret Life of Bees is a charming film , I would say worth the price if you want to see it in the movie theater . This film reminds us of the little things and the happy feeling of love . Sounds cheesy , but it's true and honestly I think anyone could enjoy this movie if you open your heart up to it . The performances were great and the story is heart warming . Dakota is growing into a fine actress and held herself very well next to Queen Latifah . So I would recommend The Secret Life of Bees , I think somewhere down the line , this will be a little treasured classic .
I liked it just as much as the first	No doubt anyone would question Christian Slater coming into the gang , but he works so well as a bad ass . Gee , I wonder why ? : ) He and Emilio play as the new rebels of the town , while Billy's old gang is moving on with their lives , but are soon arrested for walking with him , he wants the old gang back together to once again reck havec on the scene . The chemistry worked well again as the first one did , with some promising new cast like Christina Slater , Jon Bon Jovi , and an unknown Viggo Mortenson . I think if you enjoyed the first Young Guns , you are more than bound for another off your seat action western ! Yee haw ! OK , sorry , I can be a little over-dramatic at times . : - P
Pretty good actually	Even though there are no vampires . It was based on the TRUE story of Vlad the Impailor . I really enjoyed this documentary . And it was pretty funny seeing Rudolf playing Dracula again after his famous apperence on " Buffy the Vampire Slayer " as Dracula as well . If you enjoy Dracula movies , I'm not sure if you would get into this . But if you are interested in learning about how Bram got his ideas , then watch it .
An interesting film	Now , I have never seen " Despardo " before . I'm actually going to go rent it soon , because since I saw this , I'm curious what Antonio's character was like before Once Upon A Time In Mexico . Johnny Depp was the only thing I really really liked in the film . But Antonio makes up for it in those leather pants . Over all , pretty good film . I'd maybe buy or rent it to see after I watch " Despardo " . So , to others who haven't seen the film , I give it a thumb up .
What would you do if you went back to high school ?	I think that's the part about this movie that I liked the best . It made me wonder what I would do or say to people in my high school class if I knew what I know now ? I think we'd all have a little fun . I'm really not sure why , but I did kind of enjoy this movie . It reminded me a little bit of " Pleasantville " and " Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion " . The acting ? You have an A-list cast here ladies and gentlemen . Kathleen Turner , Nicolas Cage , Jim Carrey , Joan Allen , and Helen Hunt . They all did a great job and were very convincing . I think over all it was the plot that caught my interest . What would I do different ? A lot of things , but I guess I'll have to wait for my faint at my 25th reunion . :
The darker side of writing a script for a disaster movie	Twister , one of the most successful movies of the 90's , mainly due to it's special effects and a lot of people's want for a natural disaster movie that is fun to watch , this was an extremely popular movie . I was only 11 when the movie was released and I was absolutely in love with it , in fact right after the movie was done , I wanted to become a storm chaser . That's how much I loved this movie ; I grew up and forgot about the movie and decided on a new career . But I saw the DVD on sale and thought about how much I enjoyed the movie when I was younger , I'm sure it would be just as much fun to see it again . I have to say this wasn't as awesome as I remembered , in the theater it was like " Oh , my God ! Look at that flying cow ! A house just flew across the road ! That is so cool ! " , now on my TV screen I was like " Oh , wow , look at that cow . How the heck does a house fly across the road ? Why isn't this as cool as I remembered it ? " Not to mention that the story wasn't as good as I remembered , granted I know that they had to fit in some kind of story with the whole plot of the twisters , but a lot of this movie is just plain unrealistic . In June 1969 on an Oklahoma farm a tornado warning is issued , the family seeks shelter in a storm cellar as an F5 tornado strikes . However , the storm is so strong that the locks on the cellar door fail and the father is caught up in the storm and killed as his daughter struggles to catch a glimpse of the powerful storm . Years later , Dr . Jo Harding , the father's daughter , is reunited with her estranged husband ; Bill Harding . Bill is a former weather researcher and storm chaser who has taken a job as a weather reporter . He is planning to marry his new girlfriend , Dr . Melissa Reeves , and arrives at Jo's research lab seeking Jo's signature for the final divorce papers . Bill discovers that Jo has built a tornado research device called DOROTHY based upon his own design ; the device is designed to release hundreds of sensors into the center of a tornado to study its structure . The team later meets up with Dr . Jonas Miller , a smug and unscrupulous fellow meteorologist and storm chaser . When Bill discovers that Jonas has " invented " a device almost identical to DOROTHY ; he vows to help Jo deploy DOROTHY before Miller can claim credit for the idea . Bill and Melissa join Jo and her eccentric team of storm chasers . Tensions rise between Jo and Bill when they have several close calls with dangerous tornadoes as they try unsuccessfully to deploy the new device . So how does Twister hold up over these years ? Not so well , the effects are still amazing , but that's about it . I do have to admit , even though it's a bad movie , I still enjoy it like crazy . I think because if you let go of how unrealistic it is , you can just have fun with that want of destruction and chaos . Granted I know this movie is a bit stupid : our two leads , Bill and Jo , survive the impossible facing an F5 twister , the twisters always disappear as our " hero's " are in danger , Bill's fiancé puts up with quit a bit before realizing that he is a jerk for putting her through all the danger with him , Jo , a scientist , thinks that tornado's are serial killers , and not to mention that this was a record breaking day with numerous twisters . But still as bad as the acting , as bad as the story , as stupid as some of these situations may be , it's still a fun movie to watch and I think I wanna be fair with the rating just because it is mindless entertainment . It's a classic 90's disaster movie and besides , it has flying cows , what other film will give you that kind of situation ? But it's all good I think they were taking the cows to McDonald's anyways .
It was good , but way too short	I rented a few movies this weekend . I noticed " Phone Booth " and everyone said that it was a good movie . I decided to give it a shot . After all , I do love Keifer . I got home from work a little late , and I noticed that the film cover said it was 81 minutes long . So , I watched it before I went to bed . The movie is great . The acting is above average . And the story keeps you on the edge . I kept wondering what would happen next , and how it would end . When it did finally end , I looked at my clock and I couldn't believe how short this film was . Although it was ended perfectly , I wished they had added more . But I would recommend this . It was a very good film .
Test your might	" Mortal Kombat " in my opinion is just an awesome movie . I think because I was such a fan of the video games , the days when Sega was the " thang " . LOL , way before Playstation there was Sega ! But , I really just loved the characters and this story just always appealed to me . I think because also my friends and I enjoyed acting the movie and video game out . No , we didn't kill each other , we just loved the characters . Yes , despite this being a typical video game movie , I still think it was cool to watch , still to this day I don't mind watching . It has an awesome soundtrack , excellent moves , and a great look and feel to the movie itself . Just let go and have fun with it , if you enjoyed the video games , I think you should enjoy " Mortal Kombat " . It's just cool to watch and keeps you on the edge of your seat in excitement !
A creepy and solid sequel	Michael Myers , he's a household name , in my opinion he's the ultimate boogeyman , no matter what you do or how many times you try to kill him , he just comes back . Hence the Halloween series . We do have quite a bit of horror movie sequels : the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise , Friday the 13th , Hellraiser , Scream , and so on . Most sequels are extremely cheesy and don't deliver the same scares as the original movie does , but the Halloween franchise is a different story , I think these sequels were always a ton of fun and delivered just as many scares . Nothing will ever compare to the original Halloween , but it was cool to see the story continue on Michael Myers . In this story we follow Laurie Strode to the hospital and Michael doesn't just give up that easily , he's on a mission . After the film replays the last scene of Halloween , it moves on to Dr . Sam Loomis warning Sheriff Leigh Brackett that although he has shot Myers six times in the heart , Myers still lives . Meanwhile , Laurie Strode is taken to Haddonfield Memorial Hospital and Myers wanders around Haddonfield in search of her . Laurie is informed that the man who attacked her was Michael Myers , infamous for murdering his older sister fifteen years earlier on Halloween night . After this , Laurie drifts in and out of consciousness , having strange flashbacks about her adoption by the Strodes and visiting a boy in an institution . Myers learns that she is at the hospital . He goes there and murders the hospital's staff one by one . Laurie manages to elude him , but she is limping badly and sedated and is thus unable to move very quickly . Dr . Loomis and the Haddonfield police continue to search the town for Myers . Nurse Marion Chambers , Loomis ' assistant , arrives and tells Loomis that she has discovered a secret file on Myers to which he was not privy . The file reveals that Laurie is actually Myers's sister , adopted by the Strodes after Myers killed his older sister , Judith . Chambers also informs Loomis that he has strict orders to return to Smith's Grove . So they have to get back to the hospital to save Laurie before Michael can get to her . Halloween 2 is probably my second favorite sequel in the Halloween franchise next to H20 . I can't tell you how creepy this movie was , I know that these sequels are a bit much , but for any horror movie fan , they are a ton of fun to get into . The whole hospital setting was really scary , I love Laurie Strode , she's the strongest female in a horror movie , she's in a weakened state but just keeps going . You have to love the return of Dr . Loomis , him helping Laurie and making sure that Michael goes away for good , well we clearly know that it's not going to happen , but you have to give him credit for his optimism . If you are going to watch a Halloween sequel , I do recommend Halloween 2 , it's very creepy and a great addition to the story .
Depressing , but extremely powerful and moving	Sean Patrick Flannery is an incredibly under rated actor after this remarkable performance he gave in " Powder " , while the story is very dark and just not pleasant , he really gave it his all into this film and you can see how emotionally connected he is in it . We also have Mary Steinberg and Jeff Goldblum who give their all into their characters , I just think they were not that well developed enough . They could have had a little more . The movie starts off with a mother and father rushing into labor , only on the way , unfortunately is struck by listening in a massive thunderstorm . She does not survive , but the baby does and the father is not only devastated but rejects his son . Sean plays Jeremy or as most people call him , " Powder " due to him being an albino . He is hidden in his grandparent's basement and has never been out of the house . When his grandmother passes , Jessica Caldwill , played by Mary Steinberg , convinces Jeremy that he must leave and they'll give him and home and school to attend . He does leave and slowly progresses towards what he thinks may be a better life . When Donald Ripley , a school teacher , has the I . Q . results for Jeremy for his school , he is amazed . There is no score high enough for Jeremy , he's smarter than Albert Einstein . He can memorize book pages word for word , he knows agonizing math problems , and knows the pain of the world . He also has a mysterious power where he if he is exposed to electricity , he gets electrocuted . He also has the power to make people feel the same pain as they inflicted unto another , he also can read minds . Unfortunately , this isn't making him very popular with the jocks of the school who brutally torment him not just mentally but physically . There is only really Donald , Jessica , and another girl Lidnsey who want to be his friends . Only he's just not willing to except this world of pain when so many people doubt and torture him like Doug Barnum who is the town's sheriff and just thinks Jeremy is a freak . His wife is unfortunately dying and comes to Jeremy to ask for a favor and to help him find out what his wife wants . This scene is so extremely touching and tearful . The scene that got to most to me is when the boys go on a hunting trip and the coach shoots a deer for sport and are just laughing at this poor deer dying . Jeremy then takes his hand on the deer and his other hand on the coach and the coach starts to have somewhat of a seizure , and he made the coach feel the same pain he put on the deer . Poetic justice and well deserved I thought . " Powder " , despite being depressing , is a pretty decent picture worth viewing if you are in the mood for a sappy flick . But trust me , it is worth the it , you get a great performance that deserved more praise by Sean , also the same with Mary and Jeff . The acting just takes this movie to where it should be .
A very hit home drama that I'm sure most broken home folks can relate too	My parents are divorced and I live with my mom , for so long all she could say to me was how much easier it would be if there was a grave of the man she once knew . I couldn't blame her , it's a scary thing not knowing wither you want to hate someone you were brought up to love or just be unbiased . I recently rented The Upside of Anger , my mom watched it first , and said that she could've used this movie a long time ago , so I had to see what this movie was about . It's about a mom and her 4 daughters , 3 whom she lives with , and she thinks her husband has left her and his daughters for his secretary and is currently living in Sweden . Denny , a neighbor and friend , offers to help the family out , but also ends up falling in love with the mom as she does as well with him . But trouble ensues as the girls feel more and more of the mom's wrath and the stress of not knowing where their father truly is . The Upside of Anger has a terrific twist ending , but it showed the true emotions and the pain of being left alone . I could relate to the daughters the most obviously and my mom to Joan Allen . I think anyone from a broken home could relate and that's what made this movie very endjoyable . p
I actually liked Next Friday a lot better	My sister lent me the movie " Friday " a couple months ago , and I wasn't really too interested in seeing the sequels after being disappointed with the first " Friday " movie . But I figured to give Next Friday a chance because one of my friends told me that it was a lot more fun than the first and I agree . I know the rating on IMDb doesn't seem too promising , but believe me , I think that people were just being a little too harsh on the film because it wasn't like the first one . Craig has to stay with his lottery winning uncle and cousin ' till things cool down back home since the bully he took down in the first Friday broke out of prison . Well , Craig and his cousin , Day-Day , get into some crazy situations with Day-Day's ex and the neighbors across the street who are dealing with some heavy stuff . When Craig finds out about his uncle and cousin's house being sold in an auction , he and Day-Day try to find a way to get the money to keep the house . I really laughed a lot more in Next Friday than the first one , as much as I love Chris Tucker , I have to admit that he was somewhat annoying in the first movie , it was nice having a little tone down in this film . But seriously , people need to cut this movie a break because it is a really funny film when you just let go and relax . Well , I hope Friday after Next is just as funny , but we'll see .
Is it even legal to have that kind of a title ? :	Well , once again , I'm in into the Bond series , hopefully you have seen my comments or you know how I go into these type of movies . I always pick a popular genre , actor , sequel , or director and try to see all of the movies . Well , I was thinking about the James Bond series and how I used to watch it with my dad when I was younger , but I'd rather give a grown up version of a movie comment . So , you know what that means , all 20 + movies of James Bond , I'm in for quite a ride . Octopussy is about James finding this priceless egg that could lead to the end of the world . But he finds the beautiful girlfriend of the main villain and finds out more about why the egg is so powerful , she also has a mysterious octopus tattoo on her back . Leading Bond to the beautiful leader , Octopussy , who is the leader of some very hot babes , not sure why exactly . She and Bond together have to save the world together . Can they do it ? Well , you'll just have to watch Bond , James Bond !
Just Like Heaven is a cute romantic comedy with some minor flaws , but you quickly get past them	For a romantic comedy , I felt that this was one of the better one's . Reese and Mark are so adorable in this movie together and all you do is root for their characters for fall in love with each other because it's such a sweet story . I did have one problem that I felt was a plot hole , if Reese's character didn't remember who she was , how did she remember that she spilled cough syrup on her pillow ? When you watch the film you'll understand . But besides that plot hole , I did enjoy watching the awesome chemistry between Reese and Mark . They are two great actors who make fun comedies . I would highly recommend this fun little love story , it takes me back into the unchained melody days . : D Seriously , folks , enjoy !
In here life is . . . well , interesting	My mom and sister are absolutely in love with Cabaret , it's like their favorite musical . They have been trying for years to get me to watch the movie , so finally after 21 long years I finally sat down and watched it . I have to say that my mom and sister are very interesting people to love this musical , but I can see how it is so popular , frankly it is " fabulous " . The characters are adorable , somewhat odd , but it was all in good fun and it looked like they had a terrific time doing this film . Sally is a performer who has big time dreams of becoming a famous actress one day . Her life changes dramatically though when a handsome young British man , Brian Roberts , comes into her life and just sweeps her off her feet . Together they find a passion that they have needed in their lives for a long time . But another man enters their lives , Maxamilian , who also seduces Sally and Brian into a life of passion , life , and music while the whole world in is in great depression over the Nazi party taking over . Cabaret is a timeless musical that will never die , I'm sure it will be on Broadway for a very very long time . The music was fun and the actors must have an absolute blast with this musical . I would recommend the movie if you are into musicals , this is a semi-strange film , but I think that you'll get a good kick out of it . After all , in there life is beautiful .
I wondered whatever happened to Jack ? :	OK , was this the best Vacation sequel ? No , not really . But it still had a great amount of a laughter . I can't believe that some people really didn't like this film . Don't you have moments where you just want to sit down and laugh ? Don't think , just laugh and have a good time with the film ? The Griswalds are back and they are in Europe ! They have won an excellent trip to London , Paris , Germany ( they don't state where ) , and Rome . Of course they do manage to get into trouble , otherwise it wouldn't be a comedy . Clark still has the " father-knows-best " policy and becomes more obsessed with having a good time with the family than listening to them and their ideas . Ellen has become a famous naked model in Europe because of some undeleted footage that was stolen from Clark on his camera . Rusty is opting for a lot of booty in Europe and Audrey just won't shut up about a not all that boyfriend , Jack . This movie has non-stop laughter that you have to admit is catchy . They did recycle some jokes from the first , but I think you need to let go and have some fun . This was an enjoyable film .
Just wait , it gets better	Right when I began to watch " What about Bob ? " , I didn't think much of it and was getting kind of bored with it . But right at the end , it got much funnier , especially with Richard Dreyfus's character . Despite What about Bob being incredibly predictable , I wouldn't mind giving this movie another watch again . The movie is pretty funny and very heart touching . As silly as it may sound , it makes you question of who is truly insane and who is really normal ? I just loved that all Bill Murray's character needed was just a family who loved him for him . He was a lonely , but such a lovable character . He and Richard together were just great and I would highly recommend this movie for a good laugh .
Very cute and fun for all ages !	I just recently saw a trailer for " Ice Age 2 " and it looked absolutely funny ! I was asking my best friend if she ever saw the first Ice Age and she didn't see it either . So , we made our little typical trip to Blockbuster Video and rented it . " Ice Age " was so adorable and fun to watch . I mean , I really enjoyed this film , it's kind of hard to enjoy the Pixar films , because I usually enjoy the old fashion animated Disney films . I still miss them , but recently I have been also leaning towards Pixar . I've seen some very cute and lovable movies : Toy Story , The Incredables , and now Ice Age . I would highly recommend this movie for the family . It's a wonderful and charming film that will take your warm breathe away . : D Cheesy , I know , I know . I'm working on it .
A great game of cat and mouse	I was pretty surprised by " Catch Me If You Can " . To tell the truth , I thought it was going to be pretty boring . But it was was really interesting . I loved Tom Hanks , he was so amazing in his role . He really took charge . And I was impressed with Leonardo's performance . I actually believed him as Frank . But I think any actor can be pushed to his or her limits , when put with the right director . And whom better than : MR . STEVEN SPEILBERG ! The movie in itself is wonderful . The cast is brilliant , and the story is amazing . I would recommend this to anyone .
Donuts are awesome !	I am getting so addicted to Harold and Kumar's crazy adventures , it's just pathetic , when I saw Harold and Kumar go to White Castle , I was hooked and bought the movie the next day . So obviously I was so excited to see Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay , saw it opening day and it's non stop laughs still ! Now , I do hate gross humor , it's disgusting and unoriginal , yet , somehow , Harold and Kumar make it so unbelievably funny . They're back and this time they are taking the world by storm ! Kal Penn and John Cho are such a great pair and made this sequel so much fun to watch . I agree , it does get offensive at times , but if you don't take this movie seriously , I think you'll be laughing too . Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay is one of the funniest movies I have seen this year in the theater . Harold and Kumar are on their way to Amsterdam to visit Harold's love , Maria , but of course , Kumar just can't wait until they get to Amsterdam , so he smokes on a plane , but everyone mistakes the bong for a bomb and Harold and Kumar get thrown into Guantanamo Bay . When they have the chance , they take it . When they finally arrive back in America , they got to meet Kumar's ex girlfriend's fiancée who could pull some strings to get their charges clear , but the way to Texas is a long road and they have to face some interesting obstacles . Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay was so much fun to watch , I loved this sequel , the cast looked like they had the ultimate blast making this film . The scenes that got huge laughs from me was when the FBI agent offers grape soda to a guy to get information about where Harold and Kumar were , and some guy in the back round says " How about some Kool Aid ? ! " , also the scene with the return of the weed bag with Kumar and his ex girlfriend was so weird , that it was actually funny . If you loved Harold & Kumar go to White Castle , you'll love Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay , it's a comedy not to miss .
Hey ! Chill ! It was a good movie	I have to admit , I was sick of the over advertising , but I decided to give Madagascar a chance . Lately , I've actually been getting more into the computer animation flicks and wanted to see what Madagascar was all about . I don't get why there are a lot of users here on IMDb that absolutely hate this film or didn't really get into it , because I thought it was a very cute and enjoyable film for the kids and adults . Marty , Meldman , Alex , and Gloria are all zoo kept animals who are pampered all day and entertain humans on a constant schedule . Marty wants more though , he wonders where he comes from and what it would be like to be in the wild . Alex , the lion , is truly against this and will have no part of it , but tries to find Marty after he escapes . The rest of the gang follows , but they are caught by the animal catchers and are sent back , but accidentally fall of the boat shipping them home and they end up on an island called Madagascar . They are " welcomed " , if that's the right word , by other animals and must learn how to survive , but it's going to be hard when Alex is starving for meat ! I loved the American Beauty and Chariot of Fire references , I thought they were just so funny ! There are more than a few good laughs in this film and I felt like it was being unfairly rated here on IMDb , yes , it's not as great as The Incredables , but I really feel like anyone could love this film . I'm actually going to be on my way to buy it , I loved it that much , so please give this movie a fair chance . Believe me , it's worth your time .
Very funny and touching ; a new high school classic	Thanks to Charlie Bartlett's limited release , I had to wait until the DVD release , I was finally able to see it this past week and I absolutely enjoyed this movie . It was a pleasure to watch and was so funny , the story was something fun and clever , not since Ferris Bueller's Day Off or Clueless have we had a great high school classic that will be remembered for a while . I know that some people are not as into this movie as I am , but I felt like this was an intelligent script with an exceptional cast that made the story come to life . It really brought me back into my high school days , how many scary things go on in our lives during the hard times of being a teenager . All the insecurities , anger , isolation , rejection , Charlie Bartlett revisits those issues to those who have grown up and made it relate to today's teenage generation . Charlie Bartlett is a boy who just wants to be accepted by others , he gets kicked out of his private rich school and is forced to go to public school . There he is automatically picked on for looking higher class than everyone , but when he gets the school bully to finally give him a chance , they decide to sell prescription drugs to students , not only that , but Charlie counsels the students in the boy's bathroom . While the principal , Nathan Gardner , doesn't know what to do or handle his daughter who is also Charlie's new girlfriend . Nathan is loosing control of his school and trying to figure out how to handle Charlie . I really did enjoy Charlie Bartlett , I felt that it combined the drama and comedy very well together , once again , like Ferris Bueller , it's not too realistic , but it makes you believe that it could happen . Charlie is so charismatic that it makes you like his flawed character , that his life is also misunderstood by others and you can relate to him on some level . Robert Downy , Jr . delivers a great performance as Nathan Gardner , his ending scene with Charlie was done perfectly , although I do wish it ended differently , but I felt like the movie was well put together and I would recommend it for a good comedy to watch .
I tell you , men have not changed since the dawn of time :	And I'm serious ! To be honest , I wish this would have been shown in my high school class , we would've had so much fun with this flick . I'm a little upset , it sounds stupid , but I think I needed to see more " Q " movies , and this started with a " G " ! The movie ? Ah , cavemen love . To think that the future cavemen's child was conceived when he was taught how to do the deed right . : D Mind out of gutter , mind out of gutter . The movie isn't bad . I actually thought it was a lot better than " 2001 : A Space Odessey " . Yeah , it's a little slow paced and you have to guess what's going on during most of the movie . But if you didn't figure most of it out just by the title , GET HELP ! GET HOOKED ON PHONICS ! : D The movie is interesting and was a pretty decent watch .
I haven't said this in a while : THIS IS BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL	Let's face it , there are a lot of remakes , there are some good one's : The Thing , The Hills have Eyes , and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre . There are some average one's : House of Wax , House on Haunted Hill , and War of the Worlds . Then there are the bad one's : Halloween , The Fog , and Psycho . Last House on the Left , my parents had absolutely held me from the original movie , but when I became an adult I rented the movie and watched it by myself , I was just so curious what they were trying to hold me back from , I wasn't really shocked with the movie , I could see how it was gritty and brutal in the day , but after seeing movies like I spit on your grave , Hostel , Dirty Harry , Casino , etc , it just didn't really effect me . So I was actually looking forward to a remake of this just to see what they would do with the story and I have to say that they not only made it better , it was just a very great horror film that made me want to take 15 showers afterwards . Mari and her family are going on vacation . When they arrive at the house , Mari asks to sleep in the guest house instead of in the main house . Mari's brother , Ben , had died one year earlier , and the family are still trying to adjust to his absence . She finds a necklace he gave her and puts it on . She decides to ride into town to see her friend Paige . Mari's mother , Emma , is cautious , but her father , John , lets her go . Mari meets up with Paige at the store where Paige is employed . A young kid named Justin approaches the counter and asks for a pack of cigarettes , which Paige does not give to him due to his age . Justin says that if they join him at his motel room , he will give them marijuana . Paige agrees and sells him the cigarettes . They drive to Justin's motel room and Justin and Paige enter . Mari waits in the car but notices they are taking too long . She enters the room where she finds Justin and Paige on the bed getting high . She joins them and they decide to give Justin a makeover . They are interrupted by Krug , Sadie , and Francis . Krug explains that it is too risky to let Paige and Mari live . They decide to not only murder but rape the young girls . The gang goes to Mari's house not knowing that's where she's staying with her parents , her parents welcome the gang in thinking they got into a car accident . But Mari somehow survives and comes back home ; her parents discover that the people they've been helping are the same people that just tried to murder their daughter and now it's time for justice . This is the movie that you cannot wait to see justice brought to these sleazebags , they were so disgusting , I was just screaming and cheering in the theater . Like the tag line said , if bad people hurt someone you love , how far would you go to hurt them back ? If that was my daughter , you wouldn't wanna know the sick things I would've done to these slimy people . The thing that made this movie so horrific was how realistic it was . The rape scene doesn't show much but is one of the most graphic and disturbing in cinema , even my 25 year old boyfriend had to cover his eyes , he said he was just incredibly sick from it because he can't imagine the pain she was going through . The performances are on and the story is great . I would say this is one of the best remakes in years , this is not for the faint of heart though , but if you're curious about the remake , trust me , this was a very respectful movie of the original horror story of murder and revenge .
The Phantom of the Opera is here	OK , now if I wanted to see the musical , I would've bought tickets . That was my only complaint , because even though I enjoy the musical , I was looking for more of a horror movie to be honest . But the movie was very excellent . The sets , costumes , music , and acting were very up to par . I was impressed . But to be honest this new girl , Emmy Rosen , I've seen her in " The Day after Tomorrow " and I didn't like her as an actress . So , for some reason I couldn't let go of my opinion of her . I thought , no offense to her , that they could have picked someone a little more beautiful to play Christine . The Phantom I have seen in " Dracula 2000 " and he has come a long way . He is the only part in the movie that you really enjoy watching and listening too . Raoul kind of looked like the lost Hanson brother . : D This is a good movie and musical . If you enjoy musicals , I of course would always recommend .
Moving and heart gripping on the power of one voice	This year , Charlize was up for her second Oscar , and it was for North Country . She plays a woman who is just trying her best to raise her children and got away from an abusive husband . When she learns that she can make more money as a miner working with her father , she jumps on the opportunity . But there is a price to being one in the only 10 women working there out of the hundreds of men , they get harassed , big time . To boot , no one cares , they have to take everything they get and if they speak up or complain about it , then they get harassed even worse . Charlize's character finally raises her voice in a fight for equality in the work place and won't rest until every woman gets treated with the same respect a man should . This is an extremely touching and heart felt story that makes you cry at the end and made me appreciate being a woman in a man's world . Terrific performances and wonderfully made , North Country should not be missed .
Very odd , but intriguing	Before Little Children , before American Beauty , there was Blue Velvet , and American masterpiece of it's time . I came across this movie a couple years ago , but I wasn't too sure about it , but it was recommended in my 1001 movies you must see before you die book . Not to mention that I like Dennis Hopper , so when I noticed that he was in this movie , I got a little more excited to pick it up . In some ways I'm glad I waited to see Blue Velvet , just because I don't think I could have appreciated it like I do since I'm a little older . While I do think it's a bit over rated than what I was led on to believe ; this was still a very memorizing film with incredible performances . The story is so dark and disturbing , just proving that the most perfect little town has it's very dark and scary secrets . Jeffrey has come home to his very sweet little home where it is on the bound of leave it to beaver style of families and friends . But unfortunately , his father had a heart attack and is in the hospital , so Jeffrey is left on his own , while he's walking home from the hospital , he comes across a disembodied human ear , brings it to the local detective . He meets the detective's daughter , Sandy , and together they think they can solve this crime . It leads them to a woman , Dorothy , who is a singer , and makes Jeffrey into her lover , but he learns that a messed up druggie , Frank , has her in a deep hold of dark secrets and leads him into a life that he never expected . Blue Velvet was the silent success of 1986 , not to mention a first of it's kind for movies . It was kinda like one of those " look closer " films , that was pretty rare for it's time . If you enjoyed American Beauty or Little Children , I would highly recommend this movie without hesitation . The acting and whole look of the story was so memorizing . The only thing was that the story did work , but it still had an empty feeling at the end for me . I just felt like it could have had a better introduction . But over all the film picked up and this is a good one , folks .
Too serious , but I had fun !	I saw a preview of this movie on " I love the 80's : 3-D " and actually , it looked like fun and the commentaries were just so hilarious ! Hal Sparks said that it would have been more fun with " Escape from Idaho " " Potatoes , all these damned potatoes " . LOL ! But I recently rented some movies and came across this film and figured why not ? I love Kurt Russell and John Carpenter . Escape From New York is a very exciting film taking place in the future , the world is a different place . New York has been taken over by the criminals and the president's plane crashes there , he is presumed dead , but the detectives send Snake Plaskin , an outlaw who is the only possible one to get the president out of there . There is a catch , Snake has 22 hours to get the president , or the drugs put in him will kill him in that 22 hours if he does not succeed . This is an on the edge of your seat thriller with cool effects , awesome actors , and terrific and catchy lines that you'll find yourself repeating after the movie is done . I'll never look at Kurt Russell the same again , but I find him to be just a little bit cooler after this film .
Gripping , never let's go of the audience	I always thought that such films that were named like Boyz N the Hood , Hustle and Flow , and Menace 2 Society , normally titles like that are not promising to a good movie . But I have seen Hustle and Flow and Menace 2 Society which were both really good movies surprisingly and one movie that everyone recommends to me was Boyz N the Hood and just praising it , so I finally sat down and watched it the other day and this movie just got to me . This is one of the better acted movies with stories of the ghetto and the thing that I loved about this film was that it had a good strong positive message to never let go of your dreams and don't let stupid people get you down . I was really impressed mainly with the performances in this movie , who didn't have a great performance in this movie ? But I think it was Lawerence Fishbourne and Cuba Gooding , Jr . that really steal the show and tell the story so well . Tre is having a hard time in the city where he and his mother live , he gets in trouble at school and she sends him to live with his dad , Furious Styles for the summer to teach him how to be a man . Tre grows up , comes back for a summer , and lives with his dad , seeing old friends and reconnecting with an old flame , one problem , this is all happening in South Central where the shootings are frequent , drugs are being done , and you have a 98 % chance of being a looser that will probably die . He and his two best friends learn how to deal with the possibility of being killed or doing something they can never take back . Boyz N the Hood is a powerful movie that is very impressive , especially for a film that was made under a seven million dollar budget . I would recommend this movie , it is a bit violent and the swearing is persistent , but this is a film about the ghetto . But I felt like this film had a positive message that really made me smile and just kept rooting for these poor boys who had no say in their lives and just had to do the best the could to make it out of these deadly situations where they could die before even making it into an adult life . I really liked Boyz N the Hood , it's a good strong movie that will remind you to hold onto your dreams and don't let anyone get you down .
It's all your's Jamie !	After having some major doubts about Jamie Foxx winning the Oscar for best actor in " Ray " , I had a feeling that I should view it before I would make any judgments . Jamie Foxx did a remarkable job in " Ray " and I'm talking incredible . He wasn't just playing Ray Charles , he became Ray Charles . For a while I thought I was looking at him ( the actual Ray ) . Jamie had also worked so hard to become Ray that you respect him on so many levels as an actor . I really enjoyed his performance , it's one of the best I've seen in a while . The movie itself as " Ray " was a good movie all around . Very depressing and not the feel good movie of the year obviously . Although I was feeling Jamie Foxx , the movie in some ways did not do him or Ray Charles justice . To be honest , I am very familular with Ray Charle's work and his life story . I was never really a big fan , but I had a lot of respect for him as a person and musician . I felt the movie could've been a little bit more . I would very much recommend " Ray " for any movie lover . It's a good movie with an awesome performance from Jamie Foxx .
Just a nice , sweet , and honest movie	I had so much denial that this would be a good film , because of the rather harsh 6 . 2 rating on IMDb . But may I say that I am very shocked by that rating , this was such a charming movie that deserves another look . Honestly , where was Jodie Foster's Oscar nomination for this film ? While it's just a little quiet success movie , it was just a great drama . It also made me look around at what we call as this world and who is truly crazy . Nell is the main character who is just so sympathetic and lovable , she has never seen the outside world of buildings , cars , people ( besides her mother who unfortunately passes away ) , and technology of any kind . She has her own language that a doctor and a scientist , played by Liam and Natashia , are trying to figure out . Can Nell truly survive on her own or does she need help by going to a mental institution ? The acting is just great and all around this is just a nice movie to watch with any one . It's very touching and honest , come on IMDb users , give this movie another chance . This is better than most movies on the top 250 honestly , I hope some may agree .
Just as much fun as the first !	Man this movie seemed like it took such a long time to come out on DVD , it was driving me crazy . Unfortunately , I never got the opportunity to see this in the theaters , so I had to wait for the rental . Unfortunately , Hollywood Video was sold out so I had to buy the movie , but actually it was worth it , because this was such a fun movie . God bless the man who created that little squirrel who is chasing that nut , those scenes were just so cute and funny ! The gang is back , but this time , their place is melting due to the global warming , their home is being destroyed so badly that they and their herd are moving to a place with more ice . On the way the Mammoth sees another mammoth with two possums , she thinks she's a possum as well . Of course the journey is a hard one , but the team tries to stick together as much as possible and there is one crazy squirrel that is causing a few problems for the ice . Ice Age : The Meltdown has great animation , a great cast , and just over all a fun story . I have to say that it's crazy though , the past 2 movies I saw had something to do with global warming , now this movie ? I'm sensing a theme here this year with movies . : D Oh , well , just please watch this movie , I guarantee that you'll enjoy this movie if you enjoyed the first .
Whatever you do , don't watch this movie in the dark !	Trilogy of Terror is one of those movies I used to watch as a child and scared the ever loving you know what out of me . If my parents wanted me to punish me , they would just show me the ending of the third story Amelia , chilling ! So finally thinking after all these years , I could maybe buy the movie and watch it , the whole thing , beginning to end , without closing my eyes , and still to this day , I can't do it ! These are three chilling tales that no horror fan should ever go without seeing . The first story : Chad and Eddie are university students who admire their English teacher , Julie Eldrich . During one class , Chad is distracted by Julie's low cut shirt and begins to daydream about her . At home , Julie's housemate encourages Julie to get out and meet more people . The next day at university , Chad asks Julie out on a date , and after initially refusing , accepts Chad's offer . During the date at the drive-in , Chad spikes Julie's drink , rendering her unconscious . Chad drives to a motel where he checks in with Julie as husband and wife , where he photographs Julie in a variety of sexually provocative positions . Noticing Julie beginning to regain consciousness , he then takes her home , explaining that she fell asleep . After developing the photographs in his darkroom , Chad shows the pictures to Julie , who is furious and threatens to call the police . Chad blackmails Julie and she agrees to see Chad whenever he demands . But he may not realize that the joke is on him . The Second Story : A tale of two sisters , one being the prudish Millicent with curly brown hair and large glasses , and the easy going Therese with long blonde hair . Millicent is determined that Therese is evil , and plants a voodoo device to kill her . When Millicent's friend Dr . Ramsey enters the house , he finds Therese dead on her bedroom floor with the doll next to her . After speaking with the family doctor , Dr . Ramsey reveals that it was Millicent acting in a blonde wig and make-up in a dual personality manner . The Third Story : Amelia is living on her own in a high-rise apartment building . She arrives home after shopping and unwraps a Zuni hunting fetish , equipped with razor sharp teeth and a spear . A scroll accompanies the fetish , claiming that the doll contains the actual spirit of a Zuni hunter known as " He Who Kills " , and that the gold chain adorning the doll keeps the spirit trapped within . As Amelia makes a call to her mother , we learn that she is slightly neurotic , suffering from her mother's overbearing behavior , she wants to cancel their plans for the evening because she has a date . The moment Amelia leaves the room , the Zuni doll's golden chain falls off without her knowing . Later , Amelia is preparing dinner , using a carving knife . She enters the darkened living room , and realizes the doll is not on the coffee table . A noise is heard in the kitchen and when investigated , the knife is missing . Lured back into the living room , she is suddenly attacked by the doll , bloodied and terrified , Amelia flees , and manages to get in her bedroom and calls the police , but the doll enters the room , prompting her to keep running , shutting the bathroom door behind her . She runs into the kitchen , and disarms it with a kick , and receives a nasty bite to the neck . She manages to hurl it into the oven and listens to it howling and screaming as it catches fire . Soon the screams die down and eventually stop . Wondering if her ordeal is over , she opens the oven and you have to see this scary as heck ending ! Trilogy of Terror has always scared the heck out of me , granted there are some incredible cheesy moments , I'm not going to lie , the last segment is just a bit too much to handle where this stupid woman has locked the creature in a suitcase and is cutting his way out of the top of the case and for some reason Amelia tries to grab the BLADE ! What the heck ? Not to mention she keeps tripping around in her own apartment when running away from the doll . A lot of people also forget the two first stories , granted that they're nothing special , but still pretty effective tales . I highly recommend this movie if you get the chance to see it , it's a lot of fun , just don't watch it in the dark .
Nanny McPhee is Mary Popping's older and less attractive sister : -	No , I'm just kidding . I really don't watch children's movies , only when I babysit , and my cousins picked this one out for our movie night , actually it turned into a very pleasant surprise . Nanny McPhee is a very charming and lovely new " Mary Poppins " for our young generation . Even as an adult , I have to say that I enjoyed it as well . It had fun acting , bright colors , and magical enchantment that can grab anyone . Colin Firth plays Mr . Brown , a single widowed father who must marry a woman by the end of the month , otherwise his aunt will cut off his allowance and he'll loose his children . However his children not knowing of this information scare off every possible wife and nanny , that is until Nanny McPhee comes along and changes all that . She isn't the most pleasant face to look at , but does what no one else can , she brings discipline and love into the family and helps them bond and find new things that brings them together . It has the happiest ending that makes your tooth hurt , it's so sweet . : D I would highly recommend Nanny McPhee for the whole family to enjoy , it's a great movie . I should never doubt Emma Thompson , she's just so lovely and wonderful to watch . " What you need is Nanny McPhee " .
Why I liked Clerks II better than the first	I was so extremely depressed last night because I saw Clerks for the very first time . I also rented Clerks and Clerks II at the same time thinking I would probably love the first one and want to see the second one immediately , so you can understand why I was nervous to see the second Clerks after being sorely disappointed with the fist . But I figured , I rented it , just watch it and get your money's worth , so I watched it this morning and big shock ! I laughed hysterically throughout the whole film . Donte is back with Randell and the quick shop has burned down , so they start working at a fast food joint . They work with their boss , Becky and a highly religious nerd , Elias . Donte is also engaged and is moving to Florida the next day with his fiancée , but he has had an affair with Becky and finds out that she is pregnant . Jay and Silent Bob are also back and if you ask me , they have better jokes this time around . Clerks II also rocked on the argument of Lord of the Rings vs . Star Wars , about time that somebody settled that argument ! I almost died laughing with Randell and Elias , they made quite a pair and Jay and Silent Bob were a lot more enjoyable in this Clerks . Rosario Dawson was a great addition to the cast , she was absolutely lovable . I would highly recommend Clerks II over Clerks , this was a comedy that could work for anyone .
They don't make ' em like this anymore !	I really enjoyed " North by Northwest " , it had action , romance , and drama . I mean , seriously , as you have noticed in 2005 , Hollywood has come out with a string of remakes . Because all of the awesome ideas have been taken pretty much , and when I saw this film , it put me back into the appreciation of the real good movies of the past . Alfred Hitchcock is without a doubt one of the greatest directors of the 20th century . I hope his work will never die within the years because of all these remakes , I'm afraid that when I have a family one day and if my kids have a love for films as I do , they won't get to witness how great movies were made . The acting , yes , it's clique , but it works so well . It has a " Casablanca " type of feel for the romance . The action had some wit and humor to it . The story is great , I would highly recommend this classic and please recommend it to other's before Hollywood destroys all great movies .
A beautiful American film	The main reason why I wanted to check this movie out was because this was the film that Kate Winslet was nominated for once again by the Oscars , and I have to say from the film clip , this movie looked incredibly interesting . I was excited when I saw this movie for rent and grabbed it right away , I just watched it today and I have to say that while in some ways it was a disturbing story , it was also very touching in a lot of ways . I felt like I had been captured into the book , these characters had such depth and character , you felt for all of them in such ways , either you could relate or want to speak too and have some sort of relationship with . Sarah is a housewife and a mother who has lost a little something in her life , passion , while her husband is messing around on the internet , she meets the " prom king " of the block , Brad , and has a deep passionate affair with him . But there is a problem , Brad is also married with a child as well , but their affair and love is too strong to ignore when they realize that they are what were missing in each other's lives , or are they just a fantasy they needed to fulfill ? There is another character in this film named Ronnie , who had a horrible reputation after exposing himself to a minor and is snubbed by the committee , but the only love of his life is his mother who is constantly trying to get an ex cop harasser off her son's back . Little Children is an incredibly touching film , the ending was so beautiful and really brought true closure to the story . The acting was just superb , Kate and Patrick worked so incredibly well together and had hot chemistry . Also , Jackie as Ronnie , his character was so heart breaking , it was just so disturbing to watch him go through his journey of trying to be a good boy for his mommy . This was a fantastic film , one of the best American films of our time , I would highly recommend it .
We don't look at the creature as a monster , but another human being .	This was such a good movie . Kenneth is definatly one of my favorite actors in the world . He brings a lot of talent to the screen , and so does DeNiro . I thought that this movie was just beautiful and brillient . Like I said , the creature is really misunderstood in this movie . He was abandoned at his first sight into this world . And didn't understand how to survive in it . And you really hate Frankenstein for the thoughtless soul he was . And I was glad to see Frankenstein brought to justice at the end . Loosing the one's he loved most dew to his selfishness . The conversation between the creature and Frankenstein is the most intelligent I've heard since American Beauty . Just watch this movie . It is a movie that you'll learn to love .
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix	Yes ! I cannot believe I have now seen all the Harry Potter films , at least for now ; ) . Well after watching the last four Harry Potter films , I was definitely interested in seeing where the story would lead us next . The Order of Phoenix was absolutely astonishing and without a doubt the best Harry Potter yet . See , my friends who read the books didn't get much of a kick out it like I did , but I think they were just comparing too much book to movie . Who knows ? After reading the books , I'm sure I'd be like that too , but movie wise I thought this was a great movie to watch and a terrific film for the summer . Harry is having extreme nightmares ever since the death of his fellow classmate , he knows Veldemort is on the loose and will do anything to stop him . But at Hogwarts no one believes him , especially the newest addition the professors , Delorus Umbridge , and this woman is here to make student's lives an absolute night mare . In the mean time Voldemort has plans for Harry and must get his hands on a prophecy that Harry has . Harry gathers classmates that finally believe him about Voldemort and join into an army that will end in the ultimate battle between good and evil . The Order of Phoenix is a roller coaster ride of action and a great story . The actors were terrific and the movie had great effects with the best story yet . I cannot wait for the next Harry Potter film , I admit it , I'm hooked . I can't wait to start reading the books , I bought them today , I guess I'm on the band wagon of the Harry Potter fans , if you can't be them , join them , lol .
Clint's best performance since Million Dollar Baby	I saw Gran Torino opening weekend and after hearing rave reviews , I was looking forward to it . After seeing it , I realized what people were excited about , it was Clint's performance , this is a man you do not want to mess with . He's the perfect good guy with a bad guy's lust for vengeance . I love his growls , he sounds like a great guard dog , I would love to just have him by my door if a salesman comes by to make that noise . I can't believe what a triple threat Clint is : he's a writer , director , and an actor , not to mention that he's great at all three of them . He presents Gran Torino with grace and style of an old man that society has forgotten about because of his bad mood not realizing that deep down , he's truly a good man . Walt Kowalski , a retired Polish American Ford automobile assembly line worker and a Korean War veteran , lives with his dog Daisy in a changing neighborhood which is dominated by immigrants . At the start of the movie , Walt is attending his wife's funeral , bristling at the shallow eulogy of young Father Janovich . Similarly , he has little patience with his two sons , Mitch and Steve , and their families , who show little regard for Walt's grief or the memory of their dead mother . Walt's sons see him as " always disappointed " with them and their families , unaware of their obnoxiousness . Walt's teenage Hmong neighbors , a shy Thao Vang Lor and his feisty sister Sue , live with their widowed mother and grandmother . The Hmong gang , at that point , tries to persuade Thao to join them . Thao's initiation is to steal Walt's prized car , a 1972 Gran Torino Sport . Walt interrupts the robbery , pointing a rifle in Thao's face and forcing him to flee . After a few days , Spider and his gang return . With Sue at his side , Thao manages to verbally confront them to no avail . The gang drags Thao off his porch in an attempt to assault him . His family tries desperately to fend off Spider and his cohorts . The conflict ends when Walt , who fought in the United States Army's 1st Cavalry Division , threatens the gang members with his M1 Garand rifle and orders them to get off his lawn . They leave the neighborhood , telling Walt to watch his back . After seeing Sue being harassed by three black teenagers , while her " date " cannot help her , Walt steps in to rescue her , confronting the teenagers and threatening them with a pistol . Sue gets to know Walt , and invites him to a family barbecue on his birthday , bringing him closer to her family , explaining Hmong culture and that during the Vietnam War they fought on " his " side . Sue , Thao , and their mother visit Walt the next day , with Thao's family forcing him to work for Walt for a week to atone for his attempted theft of the Gran Torino . Walt has Thao clean up the neighborhood until his debt is paid and shows Thao the ways of American men . Meanwhile , the Hmong gang keeps pressuring Thao to join them . But when he refuses , the Hmong gang goes too far in getting their revenge leading to Walt wanting more than punishment , he wants justice . I highly recommend Gran Torino if you get the chance to see it , it has terrific performances and a touching story . I'm really surprised that Clint didn't get more recognition for his strength in Walt , he became that character and I loved how he protected the family that he once hated . It was wonderful to see all these characters develop and grow together , they had great chemistry and made this movie into a great one . I think down the line , Gran Torino is going to be considered a classic , this is a terrific movie and deserves it's praise .
A unique and very true story about love	It's hard to believe , I have seen so many movies , yet I have never seen a WOODY ALLEN film , it just never came to my mind . But Annie Hall is probably his most famous work and I figured that at least I could see this film since it won best picture against Star Wars , while I'm still debating if it was the best picture of 1977 , I still can't deny that this was an excellent film . The story was so wonderful and really opened the doors for the battle of the sexes , I don't think a film before this could have depicted such a better way of the way we think of the opposite sex . Alvy Singer is a comedian , slightly famous , he does everything right in his career , he always has the right lines , a great apartment in New York , a fun imagination , but with the ladies ? Well , there he becomes more short handed . But that all changes when Alvy meets a naive but lovely woman , Annie Hall . She is a singer who is trying to make it , but when he and she become an item , she opens up more and wants to do more , but Alvy just would prefer to keep things the way they are . The film is really remarkable and I have to say that I could understand it's praise , the story still remains so true to this day and any adult could really understand it's premisous . I loved the scene where both Annie and Alvy are at their therapists and they explain that the sex they're having is either not enough or too much . There are so many classic scenes , I would just recommend this film , it's a great classic that anyone could enjoy .
I'm going to be honest . . . he was a good man	When I was looking through the collection at Hollywood Video looking for a rental , I came across He Was a Quiet Man , I'm not sure why , but I picked up the film and just read what it was about . I had never heard of it before , but I enjoy Christian Slater , Elisha Cuthbert , and William H . Macy on screen , they're great actors and then I read on the summary " Office Space meets Taxi Driver " , lol , I had to see this movie . So I watched it last night , I honestly have to say that I am taken back , this was not only a good movie , but had such knock out performances ! Christian Slater , I always liked him in movies , but this performance , I am going to be honest , has to be the best of his career , I barely even recognized him , he was incredible . He makes Bob Maconel , his character , so sympathetic and understandable , that he holds the entire movie so well with class . Bob Maconel is your average working American citizen , unfortunately , he doesn't have the best looks , he lives alone ( without the companionship of his talking gold fish ) , he's taken advantage of at work , and also has a huge crush on a beautiful co-worker , Venessa Parks who would never give him the time of day . Bob has just had it , one day he has a gun and just wants to go crazy in the office and shoot everyone , but guess what ? Someone beat him to it , Bob shoots the guy , making him look like a hero , he also sees Venessa on the floor and saves her life , but she unfortunately is paralyzed . They start an interesting relationship , one that could make or break Bob's sanity once and for all . I seriously recommend this movie , it's definitely one of the most interesting films I have seen this year . The way the film was made and edited , at times was a little off , but seriously , it's the awesome performances that really make the film . Christian and Elisha really become their roles and are just incredible together , the scene where Venessa is paralyzed and wants to " please " Bob , just his reaction and her tear , the scene was so heart breaking , but touching . You'll have to see what I mean , but trust me , there are many great scenes in He Was A Quiet Man , this is a must see film .
Loose one friend , loose all friends , loose yourself . . . I heard that somewhere :	Yes , to quote " Boy Meets World " . But those were the only words I thought described this movie perfectly , don't you think ? Five friends take their about-to-be-married friend on a bachelor trip to Vegas . All is going well , they're gambling , have a fancy hotel room , doing drugs , drinking , and hire a prostitute / stripper . When one of the friends decides to have a little fun with her in the bathroom , he accidentally kills her on a towel hook , they have two choices : call the police with a chance that they'll get off of not only killing her but hiring a prostitute , or they could just bury her in the dessert . You know the choice 5 men would make , and of course it all goes down hill from here . I think I watched this movie at a perfect timing . I really enjoyed it because it was funny in a very dark way . I know it's kind of sick , but I did laugh at some of the darkest scenes and really got into it . My best friend , she's about to be married , and she reminds me a lot of Cameron's character . She wants her wedding day to be so perfect that she'll do ANYTHING to make sure of it . Well , not murder , but you get my drift . : D It's a dark comedy , there's no doubt . But I would highly recommend this because it is a good movie for laughs . Just let go and have a little fun and repeat : it's just a movie , it's just a movie , etc .
Before Sex and The City	I am absolutely in love with Marilyn Monroe and I am on a mission to see most of her movies , if not all . How to Marry a Millionaire is probably one of her most famous , but it seems to typecast her . I recently saw Gentlemen Prefer Blondes , and it reminded me somewhat of her role in that film . But still How to Marry a Millionaire is a cute and snappy romantic comedy that I think a lot of people could get into . Basically , these three young and beautiful gold diggers are looking for one thing and one thing only : a millionaire . Their mission ? To marry him . But when they meet some interesting and very very very rich men , they find out that this may not be what they want and end up instead of being a gold digger , having a heart of gold when they truly discover what love is all about . How to Marry a Millionaire is a very cute romantic comedy and just places Marilyn on a high pedestal in my opinion . She is absolutely adorable and so charming , you could never dislike her or her character . She and the other two ladies bring such a spice to this fun movie that reminds you of Sex and the City .
One of the funniest movies . . . ever !	I usually like to rent movies at least twice a month . The only catch is that I don't like taking my friends , because I like to read and I know this sounds silly , but concentrate on the movies that I'd like to see . Just because I don't like to see movies that I know will be bad . But my friends and I were out and I mentioned how I was going to rent movies that night . They asked if they could come , and I couldn't say " no " . That would just be horrible to say , and especially with my silly theory . I saw " Naked Gun " sitting there , and my friend asked me if I ever saw this movie , and I said " no " . She said that this would be the movie to watch for a good laugh . So , I decided for once to let go and rent . I was glad that I did . This is by far one of the funniest movies I have seen . You can't take it seriously , but that's what I love about it . It's a great movie . I would recommend it for comedy lovers .
One of the year's best !	I've been wanting to see American Gangster since the moment I saw the trailer , it's good to see a film that actually looks very intelligent and also has a terrific and talented cast . I saw the film today with my mom and we were both just blown away with American Gangster . It is without a doubt one of the year's best films and I guarantee you that this will be on the nomination buzz for the Oscars . First off , we have an original Mafia movie finally , something that hasn't really been touched , an African American who had power and was just put as high as an Italian Mofia boss . I didn't have an idea that someone like Frank Lucas could have the power he had , because of American Gangster , I now have a little more knowledge of history and the crimes in the 70's . Frank Lucas showed what one man with a little determination could rise quickly , but also have to suffer the severe consequences of his actions . Despite how the rise and fall story is used so often , the cast and crew made American Gangster into a real film . Frank Lucas is an African American man growing in the world of the 70's in America . Drugs are becoming a hot commodity , or at least the good and pure kind of drugs that you can only get from Vietnam . When he hears about this , he heads over there and makes a deal with the drug lord , he manages to bring in 2 , 000 kilos into the United States ! He's now a popular customer there and in America , he's living the high life . He moves his family into a gorgeous mansion , he gets a beautiful Puerto Rican wife , and is respected by most of the community . He's never even suspected of anything , that is until his wife gives him a coat that stands out quite a bit in a crowd , and he is photographed by Detective Richie Roberts . Roberts is now on Lucas's case and has problems of his own , over half of his team is being bribed by drug dealers , and he's under the same pressure to just give into temptation of a bribe . American Gangster is the best Mofia movie this year , I promise you . It's a fantastic film and has just flawless performances . I wouldn't be surprised if Denzel Washington will be nominated for a best performance award . His performance as Frank was so brilliant , he was scary , yet smooth , unpredictable , yet charismatic . He couldn't have played it better . Russell is riding on the roller coaster of great performances this year , he's not as powerful as Denzel , but he stands great on his own in American Gangster . Ridley Scott , our director , has proved that he can handle the Mofia genre , he handled the film with utter perfection and this is his best film in years . American Gangster actually surpassed my expectations , I definitely do recommend this movie , it's a great one .
Are you kidding me ? ! 5 . 5 ? ! I had so much fun watching Open Season !	I was very much looking forward to seeing Open Season on it's first weekend , but I was a bit worried when I saw only a 5 . 5 on IMDb , because normally , most of the users are right about these movies . But my friends and I still wanted to see this fun looking picture , so we saw it tonight and may I say that I am surprised by you IMDb users who didn't like this film , everyone is entitled to an opinion , I agree . But seriously , how could you not like this film ? It has amazing animation , fun characters , and hilarious jokes for kids as well as adults ! After a bear , Boog , saves a deer , Elliot , from becoming another trophy for an evil hunter , Shaw , they become instant friends . But since Boog is a pampered bear , Elliot wants in on the room service , but ends up getting Boog in some trouble and back into the woods , together they decide to get back to civilization , trying their best to avoid open season from other hunters as well as getting away from Shaw . My favorite character is the porcupine , he was just so cute , " Buddy ! " . Especially , the scene where the dame explodes causing a huge wave of water to splash over the woods destroying everything and moving all the animals away from their safe place and the porcupine sees Boog and Elliot and just smiles and happily screams " Buddy ! " while getting swooped up into the wave as well ! It was so funny ! Seriously , people , learn to have some fun , I know this was a kid's movie , but my friends and I had a great time watching this movie . This is one of the best movies I have seen of 2006 , hopefully , the rating will go up . To those who loved this movie , thank you for having a good sense of humor , to those who didn't like the movie , just give it another shot , please ! :
What I'm feeling for this film isn't love , it's pure admiration	Slumdog Millionaire , the best film of 2008 by far , I saw this back in December after hearing a little bit about it on the net . I was so excited to see that it was playing at my local theater and I didn't hesitate to see it when it was released . There are a lot of people who are just asking why this film is so popular or loved , the reason why in my opinion is that it's just a happy film . We usually have a best picture winner that is depressing , but instead Slumdog Millionaire just lifts your spirits and makes you cry in joy . I couldn't believe how much I loved this film , after reading a summary on what it was about , I was just confused and wondering if this film was really going to be good . But we have these unknown young actors : Dev Peitel , Freida Pinto and Madhur Mittal who pull in heart wrenching performances and you can't help but love their characters and just keep rooting for them . All in all , this film is a love story . Most film lovers fear those words after Titanic because everyone thought it to be a predictable puppy love story , this love story however is made in strength and faith and you can't help but keep wanting Jamal and Latika to be together . Even though I saw the film a while back , I still remember it like I saw it yesterday . A title card is presented : " Jamal Malik is one question away from winning 20 million rupees . How did he do it ? A ) He cheated , B ) He's lucky , C ) He's a genius , D ) It is written . " Jamal is a contestant on the Indian version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire ? hosted by Prem Kumar in which he was on the show and won 20 , 000 , 000 rupees ( about US$500 , 000 ) . Jamal then explains that , while at least the question about Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan was very simple , he knew the answers of most questions by chance , because of things that happened in his life . This is conveyed in a series of flashbacks documenting the details of his childhood . This includes scenes of him obtaining Bachchan's autograph , the death of his mother during the Hindu anti-Muslim violence , rekindling the memory of the 1993 anti-Muslim attacks in Mumbai by Hindu nationalists in the slums , and how he and his brother Salim befriend Latika . The children are eventually discovered by Maman while they live in the trash heaps . Maman is a gangster who " collects " street children so that he can ultimately train them to beg for money . Salim is groomed to become a part of Maman's operation and is asked to bring Jamal to Maman in order to be blinded . Salim protects his brother , and the three children try to escape ; but only Salim and Jamal are able to do so . Latika is re-captured by Maman's organization and raised as a culturally talented prostitute whose virginity will fetch a high price . The brothers eke out a living , traveling on top of trains , selling goods , pretending to be tour guides at the Taj Mahal , and picking pockets . Jamal eventually insists that they return to Mumbai since he wishes to locate Latika . When he finds her working as a dancer in a brothel , the brothers attempt to rescue her , but Maman intrudes , and in the resulting conflict Salim draws a gun and kills Maman . Salim then uses the fact that he killed Maman to obtain a job with Javed a rival crime lord . Salim claims Latika as his own and when Jamal protests , Salim threatens to kill him and Latika intervenes , accepting her fate with Salim . Years later , Jamal has a position at a call center . When he is asked to cover for a co-worker for a couple of minutes , he searches the database for Salim and Latika . He gets in touch with Salim , who has become a high-ranking lieutenant in Javed's organization . Jamal confronts a regretful Salim on tense terms . Salim invites Jamal to live with him and after following Salem , he sees Latika living there . He talks his way in as the new chef and tries to convince Latika to leave . She tries to discourage him , but on the first day that Jamal waits at the train station , Latika attempts to escape with him , but is recaptured by Salim and Javed's men . One of the men then slashes her cheek with a knife , scarring her as Salim drives off , leaving Jamal with the onlooking crowd . Jamal again loses contact with Latika when Javed moves to another house . In another attempt to find Latika , Jamal tries out for the popular game show because he knows that she will be watching . I cannot wait for this movie to be released on DVD , it's a terrific uplifting movie that just captures your heart and makes you feel good . I couldn't believe that people were just complaining about the ending dance sequence , it was a TERRIFIC way to end it , to see everything that Jamal went through and that dance just makes you feel happy because you can tell the joy of him having his Latika in his arms . It was a beautiful ending and makes you extremely joyful . The story is brutal , funny , sad , original and beautiful . Danny Boyle , I knew that this director had something special when he made the horror film 28 Days Later , but who knew he could pull of such an uplifting beautifully made film ? He picked the perfect actors , made the film wonderfully , and the whole crew seemed to enjoy making this together . Who wouldn't ? It was a pleasure to watch on the screen and if you haven't seen this film in the theater , buy it when it comes on DVD , it's one of the most terrific experiences I've had watching a film . We haven't had a film like Slumdog Millionaire and it's one of my new favorite films of all time .
Like " Jaws " kept you out of the water , " Super Size Me " will keep you away from fast food restaurants	I had a report to do on childhood obesity , and I could use this documentary as one of my resources . May I say that I was glad that I watched this film . It is very terrifying what the fast food industry has done to this country . I'm not trying to bad rap them , they're a business . That's what they do , they try to make money . Do I agree with all the law suits going on with people blaming McDonald's and Burger King for making them fat ? No , nobody is shoving the food down their throats . But there are so many people out there that are heavy users of fast food , and this documentary shows what the damaging effects can be of eating fast food . I gave up fast food , and have not had any for over a year now , and my health has boosted up majorly . Watching this film might make you want to stay away from the fast food restaurants , but if not , it'll make you think more about what you are eating .
A comment from a non smoker	My father and I are the only non smokers in the family , and even my dad was a smoker way back but quite . I haven't caved into the peer pressure , or at least yet , but probably won't . Why ? Smoking , from what I've learned , is a very deadly and addictive substance , it's like putting poison in your body . But I don't judge other smokers , never have since I grew up around them , but I always wondered why and how someone could get into it . Tobacco companies for years have been trying to be convincing on how they care and are trying to stop other possible young buyers , lol ! Thank You For Smoking is one of the most intelligent and funny movies I have seen in a while . It mixes the truth with comedy , not to mention that the lead character's voice makes such an impact and argues so well . He'd make you want to easily start smoking because he is so charming and smooth . It was also interesting that he had a son , you spend some of the movie debating wither or not he's trying to make his son like him socially or just teach him how to survive in the world of constant arguments . Like I said , this is one of the most intelligent movies that moves so well and was brilliantly made . The cast brought so much to this story that could've been disastrous , but turned into a total masterpiece of a movie and a great debate for many . You gotta love a movie that keeps you thinking way after you finish watching it .
Flawless	No Country for Old Men is the movie that has everyone talking ; this morning , I was reading how this is going to be the Oscar winning movie , I just had to find out where it was playing . I just saw this with my friend this afternoon and I was blown away . It's a little odd because this did not seem like a typical movie that I would love , but the performances were absolutely flawless and the writing was brilliant . My friend just kept saying how horrible it was , but I don't think some people are going to understand how great this movie really is or need to see it again to understand it . I was never really a fan of the Coen Brothers and their work , but the reason why I loved this movie is due to the fact that it points out the violence in the world and how far people will go to get money or drugs . No Country for Old Men is blunt and shows the ultimate evil of the world , but also the good as well . Llewelyn Moss is a cowboy who has just encountered quite a find , he stumbles across the desert to find several dead bodies and a truck load of heroin . When he walks a little farther , he finds another dead body , but there's something in a suit case that's a little bit more of what he could use , 2 million dollars ! He's got everything in the clear , but he remembers one of the bodies that survived and needed water , so he goes back to help him out , big mistake . Now the serial killer who owned that money and drug load is after him . This serial killer , Anton Chigurh , is possibly the most cold blooded murderer and will not stop until he has his money and Llewelyn is dead . But also Sheriff Ed Tom Bell is trying to find Anton and find Llewelyn before it gets more deadly . No Country for Old Men is the most brilliantly written movie of the year . Javier Bardem , who plays Anton , will hopefully get an Oscar nomination for his performance . Javier pulled such a chilling performance , he was terrific and so frightening , I never really took a look at his talent until No Country for Old Men . Josh Brolin , it's truly amazing how far this man has come , from The Goonies to a gut-wrenching performance , he's great . Tommy Lee Jones also held his own very well and made the sheriff the most likable character and was the light in this dark movie . No Country for Old Men is a great movie , believe me , it's worth the watch , just take some time after the movie to think about it and what you have just seen , because for the first time , I can say that the Coen Brothers are really amazing .
The Perfect Couple ?	Pretty recently I had heard quite a bit about Harold and Maude , from my 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book and from my sister . When her and I were teasing each other on movies we did not see , she brought this up and told me how I had to see it . So , I finally came across it at Hollywood Video and figured what the heck ? My sister is into very strange films , but this was also on COMEDY'S 100 funniest movies of all time , so I needed a good laugh . The movie started off a little strange , but then everything came more together and when Maude came in , this movie just took off . I couldn't believe how much Maude rocked , she is everything I want to be at 21 years old . Harold is a young man who has no direction in life , his one pleasure is going to a funeral , even if he did not know the person , but there he meets 79 year old Maude , she shares the same passion as he does . On top of that , she steals cars , trees , and has the strongest passion for life while Harold is finding ways to fake a suicide to freak his mom out . But together they find a little romance and bring out the best in each other , even if no one else can see that . Harold and Maude is possibly one of the most unique and original stories I have watched , it was so strange and off putting , yet it worked and became a masterpiece that any film lover would enjoy . It truly deserves it's praise and more , it had wonderful acting , great chemistry , and a very original story . The 70's were a quirky time , but also a great time for movies !
Let's talk about sex	Alfred Kinsey , what a guy . I have learned a lot this year about human sexuality . It's a fascinating subject and not perverted if you take it seriously and in a mature manor . I went to Italy and England , I live in America by the way , and things were so different there . People were very open about their sexuality . Men greet each other by hugging or giving a kiss on the cheek . Being a homosexual wasn't an embarrassment , I saw two girls making out on the street . When I came back to America , the most people do on the streets that I've seen is a man and a woman kissing . I'm not sure why people are so afraid of sexuality , because I do not believe it is a sin . Whatever higher power or none that you believe in gave us these feelings to express . That's why I enjoyed the film , because everything Kinsey said for the most part was real and true . Everyone is so scarred to admit that they've kissed the same sex or had some kind of an " unusual " experience . I'm not kidding , I think this movie should be shown to teenagers 13 + . If that's offensive , I'm sorry . But I don't think we should keep these feelings secret anymore . This a very serious subject and we should be more open about it .
For a girl who doesn't enjoy westerns much , this was one of the greatest films ever !	Gosh , The Good , the Bad , and the Ugly , I finally saw this film ! Who hasn't heard of it ? First off , may I say that Clint Eastwood . . . what a hottie in his day ! : D Sorry , had to get that off my chest . Sergio Leone from what I understood was a huge western film fanatic and in the 60's pretty much most folks had moved onto other genre's . I mean , I would agree that most western's are pretty much the same and stereotypical . Sergio however took a story and added some elements to it such as comedy , drama , and war . The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters . By far my favorite character was The Good , played by Clint . He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him . When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200 , 000 , they go for it . Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe . The Good , The Bad , and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic . Let's give it up for Sergio !
A great comedy / horror flick	There was a time when believe it or not , I wasn't into the movie . I thought the ending was a little weak . But after giving the movie another chance , I loved it . This is without a doubt one of my favorite horror films , because it has such a brilliant combination of horror and comedy that is priceless . John Landis , he was such a great director in the 80's and I learned that this was one of his first scripts . This movie was also a break through Oscar wise , this is the first film to win best make up effects . Which it totally deserved because we actually get to witness the transformation from man to werewolf on screen and it's unforgettable . For 1981 , these effects were amazing ! Taking place in London , as two Americans are back packing through Europe , we have David Naughten who plays David Kessler and Griffin Dunne who plays Jack Goodman . When they are warned to " beware the moon and stick to the road . . . oops ! " , they loose their way and are viciously attacked by a werewolf . Jack is unfortunately killed but David is bitten and the werewolf gets killed by the town's people . David wakes up in the hospital where he is being cared for by a beautiful nurse , Jenny Agutter who plays Alex Price and is David's love interest in the movie . When David has finally gathered himself and accepts what happened as just a " freak " accident , Jack , a terribly dismembered and gouged out dead Jack comes to visit David from beyond the grave . It starts off as just this hilarious conversation talking about Jack's funeral while David is debating if he's going crazy or not , my favorite line is in this scene : " Susan ( name ? ? ? ) cried a lot and snuck the comfort in Mark Levigne's bed " David is shocked and says " Mark Levigne ? ! " Jack just playfully remarks " An ae , life mocks me even in death " . LOL ! Then Jack tells David that they were attacked by a werewolf and he must kill himself otherwise he'll kill others and make them like Jack whereas he cannot go to Heaven or Hell , he's on the line until the werewolf's blood is severed . " Have you ever tried talking to a corpse ! ? It's boring ! I'm lonely ! Kill yourself , David , before you kill others " is Jack's last lines before David just begs Nurse Alex to get him out of the hospital . Through a love or lust story between Alex and David , David is warned once again by Jack who is now becoming more decayed , he ignores the warnings thinking it's only his conscience but is terribly wrong when he kind of goes on a stroll during the full moon killing 6 people in London . He then is confronted by all of the corpses along with Jack and just have this great scene of how to kill himself . Guys , this is a terrific movie and is a must see for horror fans , comedy fans , any type of movie fan . It's just a lot of fun to watch and it's scary and exciting and you just can't miss it . Beware the moors and maybe get yourself a silver bullet if you go to London . :
This is the sequel that dreams are made of .	Normally when people tell you about a sequel that was better than the original or just as good , Terminator 2 is always guaranteed to be in their list ; why ? Because this is THE action movie of all action movies , next to Die Hard , this is the movie that isn't just about the action as well , but has an incredible story and message behind it that will always stay with you . Terminator 2 like the first Terminator film has memorable lines , moments , and incredible effects . This is the film that made you believe in " liquid metal " machines . Robert Patrick's performance is flawless , to be honest I found him a million times more terrifying than Arnold in the first Terminator , because Robert looks like this normal average guy , but he's not like Arnold where he gets shot and you can clearly see he's a terminator , Robert goes back to human looking and won't stop . Not only that you don't know how to stop him . Linda Hamilton returns and gives a great performance as Sarah Conor who is no longer a meek little girl , she has turned into a strong woman who will do anything to protect her son and the future . Arnold is back and he's better then ever ! No wonder in the future they made several terminators that look like him , he's great entertainment . Eleven years after Sarah Connor destroyed the original Terminator that was programmed to kill her , two Terminators arrive in Los Angeles from the year 2029 . The first is a Terminator identical to the one that Sarah first encountered , while the second is a new model which assumes the identity of a police officer . John Connor is now a 10 year old living with foster parents . Sarah's experiences have made her tougher and more vigilant , but also desperate to warn humanity about the coming apocalypse . After attempting to bomb a computer factory , Sarah is arrested and remanded to the Pescadero State Hospital for the Criminally Insane under the supervision of Dr . Silberman . Meanwhile , the Terminators locate John Connor in a mall . After John is rescued and a chase through the L . A . storm drain channels , the original Terminator escapes with John on his motorcycle . The Terminator explains that he is reprogrammed by the future John Connor to protect and obey John's younger self . The other Terminator is a T-1000 , an advanced new prototype programmed to kill John . It is made of " a mimetic polyalloy " , a liquid metal that allows it to take the shape and appearance of anything it touches . It can also form into knifes and stabbing weapons . Learning that the T-1000 will likely kill Sarah and then mimic her to lure John , John orders the Terminator to help free her . Initially , Sarah is terrified by the Terminator ; but after seeing it fight off the T-1000 , she accepts that they need its help . As they escape the city , the Terminator informs John and Sarah about Skynet , the sentient computer system that will nearly wipe out humanity in an apocalyptic nuclear attack on " Judgment Day " . Terminator 2 is one of the best films of all time , this is a film that I absolutely adore and if someone hasn't seen it , there's something seriously wrong . This story is a special one : humans , are we our own worst enemy ? Arnold's line " It's in your nature to destroy yourselves " is something that always sends chills down my spine because it's true . I loved the relationship between Arnold and Eddie Furlong , interesting to see a terminator take the place perfectly of a father and you see the pain in Eddie's eyes of never wanting to let go of the terminator . Like Sarah Conor said " The terminator wouldn't stop , it would never leave him . It would never hurt him or shout at him or get drunk and hit him or say it was too busy to spend time with him . And it would die to protect him . " meant a lot to me . Like I said , if for some odd reason you have seen this movie , do see it ! I promise you that it's just an excellent film and one that will always stand out against cinematic history .
" I am filled with Christ's love ! " - LOL !	I have heard a lot about " Saved " , for the most part they were really good reviews and also it was the rebirth of Mac Culkin's career . But I am not huge on Mandy Moore's acting , so I hesitated , but was willing to see what the hype was about . Mandy , I owe an apology , because she without a doubt stole this movie , her performance was flawless . To be honest , her character scared me the most , because unfortunately , I knew someone who was EXACTLY in every way like her character . She was holier than thou , and truly acted like it when all that she's doing is hiding behind God and his philosophy . A lot of issues that were brought up in this film I could relate too . I have some gay friends who are really put down by most of America , but I thought the same as Mary , where if God had created us so different , why are we only supposed to follow Christian's rules ? We feel the pressure of religion and just trying to follow the rules so carefully because if their is a Heaven , we would like to go there . Saved is a great teenage film and I more than highly recommend this movie . It has some great and funny lines that are so memorable . I think it's a necessary film for teens to be honest , because most can relate to it in some way . I'm definitely buying this one !
