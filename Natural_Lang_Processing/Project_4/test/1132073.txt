This movie is so stupid , I'M sorry I rented it !	SPOILERS and WARNING TO MAJOR MONSTER FANSI read what this movie was about at the hollywood video store and it sounded like it was going to be one heck of a monster fest . I watch the first 20 minutes of it and I turned it off . I just couldn't believe it . About a hundred F words , a gang dressed in drag and other very distgusting things . We still havn't found out what the creature or monster was . We then played the and fast forwarded the this filthy film just to see the monster and it turns out to be a worm ! A stupid looking puppett . And boy what a way to end it . We see this woman having sex with it ! ! ! Like this is supose to be so dang great ! Here I was expecting a hardcore moster fest and is all I got was a woman having fun with a stupid worm ! If you really like stupid movies this rent this stupid Item .
What IS this movie ?	The Swap ( Sam's Song ) Review The Swap AKA Sam's Song AKA Line of Fire is a fair film that has a different cast including Robert De Niro , Jarred Mickey , Jennifer Warren , Terrayne Crawford , Martin J . Kelley , Phyllis Black , Viva , Anthony Charnota , Lisa Blount , and Sybil Danning . The acting by all of these actors is not so good . Robert De Niro really is as great as he is in other films he's in . Anthony Charnota is really the best of the bunch in this outrageous low budgeter . The film was really a laugh fast . I get back to that in a sec . One part I thought was absolutely unneeded was this clip from adult film . It was strong scene and it completely sucked ! Plus also what is shown is a woman's bare chest , again completely unneeded . OK back to hilarious scenes . I was chuckling when the phone was off the hook and made similar if the the exact noises heard in the classic film , Inframan ! Then what about the great dialog ! For example , Charnota says ' It's been twelve years since I had a mayonnaise and peanut butter sandwich . Now that's what I call cruel and unusual punishment ' ! He sometimes looks hilarious especially when he gets out and he is looking around ! Really the movie is filled with atrocious dialog from beginning to end ! Oh and what about the scene when Charnota gets shot in the side and he barely limps ! He must really be immune to pain ! How can I forget the assassin shooting and killing the woman through the mail slot ! Some of the guns sounds like fire crackers and smokes like cap guns ! There is much more in this movie . The music is OK . The film is really good if you low budget films that you can laugh at . If you like Robert De Niro , Anthony Charnota , the rest of the cast in the film , Action , Dramas , Thrillers , Crime , and interesting low budget films then see this film today ! Movie Nutball'S NOTE : If you like low budget films that are so bad that you can laugh at them then I recommend Werewolf ( 1996 ) , APE ( 1976 ) , Track of the Moon Beast ( 1976 ) , Demonicus ( 2001 ) Black Friday ( 2003 ) , and Fear Runs Silent ( 1999 ) !
The Stickup was very disappointing : (	Some SpoilersThis film was confusing because you didn't know what you saw was real or not and if it was when did it happen ? James Spader and David Keith were good but with very low sound quality and confusing moments it was really a waste . I could barley understand what they were saying with the volume very high up . One thing that was confusing was if Spader wasn't the robber then why was he seen wearing the jump suit and clown mask in and out of the car ? Either it was big plot hole or the movie lied ? I really don't know but what I do know is that with two good actors the movie was one big disappointment : ( Only see this film if you like Spader , Keith , and / or confusing movies with some action .
A disappointing horror film : (	Troll was really a good project that in My opinion was handled poorly . The cast was really good but they did their best . Poor Noah Hathaway , the great young actor of The Neverending Story had to be a part of this . Michael Moriarty's character was a joke and his character's wife no only looked liked but wanted to be Kay Lenz . Why in the world was Sonny Bono in this ? Poor little Phil Fondacaro . You get so attached to his character and then that stupid thing happens to him . Julia Louis-Dreyfus ' character was had potential but when she danced and teased the viewer that was enough and what was with not using June Lockhart as the one to stop the troll but then her character is played by her real life daughter and then she suddenly gets defeated ? The Troll looked very good though . I hate to bash any film but I just ain't satisfied with this one though most horror fans will !
The film was great until the end .	Hangman is a fair film that has a good cast which includes Lou Diamond Phillips , Mädchen Amick , Mark Wilson , Vince Corazza , Robert Haley , Grant Nickalls , Rosemary Dunsmore , Stephanie Moore , Dan Lauria , Judah Katz , and Eric Skye Erickson . The acting by all of these actors is very good . The thrills is really good and some of it is surprising . The movie is filmed very good . The music is good . The only downfall is the sex and nudity scene when Amick is on the guy . I thought that was silly and lowered the film and which I thought brought the excitement of the film down a few stars however , the film is quite interesting and the movie really keeps you going until the end . This is a very good and thrilling film . If you like Lou Diamond Phillips , Mädchen Amick , Mark Wilson , Vince Corazza , Robert Haley , Grant Nickalls , Rosemary Dunsmore , the rest of the cast in the film , Action , Thrillers , Crime , Dramas , and interesting films then I strongly recommend you to see this film today !
Crocodile !	Crocodile is a fair film that has an okay cast which includes Mark McLachlan , Caitlin Martin , Chris Solari , D . W . Reiser , Julie Mintz , Sommer Knight , Rhett Jordan , Greg Wayne , Harrison Young , Terrence Evans , and Vern Crofoot . The acting by the actors is fairly good . The thrills are fairly good and some of it is surprising . The movie is filmed fairly good as well . Same thing goes for the music The film is quite interesting and the movie really keeps you going until the end . This is a very good and thrilling film . If you the the cast in the film , Monsters , Giant Animal films , Horror , Thrillers , Mystery , and interesting films then I recommend you to see this film today !
Good action movie with scenes from other films !	This Treat Williams film was good but most of it is scenes from other films such as Predator and Last Action Hero . The original scenes are good but the film is just an entertaining action film . If you like Williams then I recommend you to see Deep Rising as I think it is his best film .
Entertaining movie Ice-T , James Russo , and J . Kenneth Campbell !	Minor SpoilersThis is a ok air plane flick with Ice-T , James Russo , and J . Kenneth Campbell . Speaking of Campbell he plays the same role in this film as he did in Turbulance and yes he gets killed in Sonic Impact as well ! He is in My opinion a little like Thomas Rosales Jr . There is another note here about Sonic Impact . Don't quote Me on this but I believe Sonic Impact and and another plane film called Submerged has the same score ! Yes the same music in both different films ! Anyway the movie is entertaining and is a good one to watch !
Belly of the Beast !	Belly of the Beast , Steven Seagal's latest movie ! The film has very good action and Steven Seagal is very good in the film . It has a different story . Like some of his recent movies it takes place in other countries . It has a whole bunch of action including a great sword fight scene and there is a ton of shoot outs so if you are fan that loves shooting that seem almost endless and if you think movies don't have that sort of thing anymore the Belly of the Beast has plenty of it ! The bad guys are interesting villains . The movie is not bad at all ! If you love Steven Seagal then check Belly of the Beast ! Movie Nuttball's NOTE : If you are big Steven Seagal fan like Me then I strongly recommend you to check out these other great movies ! Above the Law , Hard to Kill , Marked for Death ( Must see because it great ! ) , Out for Justice ( Great ! ) , Under Siege , On Deadly Ground , Under Siege 2 : Dark Territory , The Glimmer Man ( In My opinion his all time best and one of the greatest films ever ! ) , Fire Down Below , The Patriot , Ticker , The Foreigner , and Out for a Kill !
From Hell !	From Hell is a ok film with a nice budget and cast . The film is a little disturbing but if you watch Tim Burton's Sleepy it is nothing and the sex scenes aren't much at all and it seems that Johnny Depp plays Ichabod Crane again but this time he is much braver . Ian Holm was good . If you Jack the Ripper films this is a different film for you to watch !
Nightflyers !	This sci-fi / horror film is very unusual . I really don't want to spoil it but it has a slow beginning and middle but the climax is a long intense ending ! If you haven't seen this movie before than give it a chance , it'll be a different experience for the sci-fi and horror film fan !
Psycho , The remake is good but doesn't match up to the original !	The remake of Psycho was a good try but it just didn't have the spirt of the original . Some stuff was added that I didn't like like when Norman was peaking thru the hole . Him doing that wasn't needed . Danny Elfman's music was just as good and everything else was fine . It was a treat to know that James Remar was the Patrolman . The end was really good but I recommend the original over this any day !
King Cobra !	King Cobra is a very good film that has a good cast which includes Pat Morita , Scott Hillenbrand , Casey Fallo , Hoyt Axton , Joseph Ruskin , Courtney Gains , Eric Lawson , Arell Blanton , Jerry Kernion , Michael Leopard , Erik Estrada , Nick Jameson , and Cedric Duplechain . The acting by all of these actors is very good . The thrills is really good and some of it is surprising . The movie is filmed very good . The music is good . The film is quite interesting and the movie really keeps you going until the end . This is a very good and thrilling film . If you like Pat Morita , Scott Hillenbrand , Casey Fallo , Hoyt Axton , Joseph Ruskin , Courtney Gains , Eric Estrada , the rest of the cast in the film , Giant Snake Films , Horror , Sci-Fi , Thrillers , Dramas , and interesting films then I strongly recommend you to see this film today !
Say Nothing !	Say Nothing is a very different film that has a good cast which includes William Baldwin , Nastassja Kinski , and Hart Bochner . The acting by all of these actors is very good . Baldwin is really excellent in this film . I thought that he performed good in this movie . Fans of Kinski should like her in this movie . The mystery is really good and some of it is surprising . The movie is filmed very good . The music is good . The film is quite interesting and the movie really keeps you going until the last moment . This is a very good and thrilling film . If you like William Baldwin , Nastassja Kinski , and Hart Bochner and the rest of the cast in the film , Mysteriers , Thrillers , Dramas , and interesting films then I recommend this film !
King Kong Lives !	This is one of the great movies of the 80s in MY collection that I think about all the time . Some minor spoilersKing Kong Lives starts right where the 1977 version left off . KKL is very good movie and is really a super sequel . Its made very well and the acting and effects is very good but the movie is just plain sad . I guess all lovers of Apes will cry if they see this movie . I don't want to spoil it it for you but there is lots of action and the film is never boring . I really like the scene where King Kong walks through the swamp and is all you see is fog then and black sky . That is so neat . I wouldn't recommend this movie to people who dislike animals getting hurt . If you like King Kong but don't like to see the great ape get hurt then I recommend that you see King Kong vs . Godzilla and King Kong Escapes . In them movies he is unstoppable . The music it terriffic ! Its by John Scott . Its a great score . Overall King Kong Lives is great movie !
Good Stallone film !	This film is a good entertaining Stallone film . Donald Sutherland , Sonny Landham , and Tom Sizemore were all good . It is entertaining and its a good jail fighting film . I wouldn't say it is Stallone's best film but if like Stallone , the above mentioned actors , and action its worth a watch !
This is a cook 007 film with some cool villains !	Roger Moore's first Bond film is excellent ! The story is good and the villains are very neat especially Tee Hee ! Yaphet Kotto acted very well ! Live and Let Die is a good 007 film and if you like James Bond and Roger Moore then look no further to Live and Let Die !
Great horror !	This Bela Lugosi film is a very different . The story is good and it has a very different ending . The sets are scary and the look Bela gets on his face is really scary and check out his facial hair ! If you like Universal Monsters and like to see a movie similar like one then check out White Zombie !
Jingle All The Way !	One of the most hilarious film of all time in My opinion is Jingle All The Way ! It stars Arnold Schwarzenegger , Sinbad , Phil Hartman , Rita Wilson , Robert Conrad , Martin Mull , Jake Lloyd , James Belushi , Paul Wight , and Richard Moll . Arnold is very good in this film and he is funny . Sinbad is hilarious in this film . I amazed how big Sinbad is when he stands next to Arnold . Hartman is very good in this film too and he shows that he really was a quality actor . The wrestler Paul Wight who is a huge man also performed good . The action is really great and a lot of the scenes are really cool ! The dialog is really smart in this movie . The music by David Newman is good . I really like this film and I think its one of the best ! If you love Arnold and the other cast members and love Christmas action comedy films then I strongly recommend Jingle All The Way today ! Movie Nuttball's NOTES : Here are some other Arnold recommendations : Conan the Barbarian , Conan the Destroyer , Red Sonja , The Terminator , Terminator 2 : Judgment Day , Terminator 3 : The Rise of the Machines , The Running Man , Raw Deal , Commando , Predator , Total Recall , Kindergarten Cop , Last Action Hero , True Lies , Junior , Eraser , Batman and Robin , End of Days , and Collateral Damage !
The 2000 MLB All-Star Game !	One of the most unique Major League Baseball All-Star games was the 2000 edition . There were many surprising moments in this game and every second of it in My opinion was exciting ! So many great players were chosen in this game . Including Jim Edmonds , Steve Finley , Andres Galarraga , Jeff Kent , Darryl Kile , Barry Larkin , Al Leiter , Mike Lieberthal , Greg Maddux , Mark McGwire , Mike Piazza , Barry Bonds , Sammy Sosa , Alex Rodriguez , Manny Ramirez , Cal Ripken Jr . , Edgar Martinez , Fred McGriff , Magglio Ordonez , Jorge Posada , Ivan Rodriguez , Derek Lowe and so many other greats ! One of the many things I like about the All-Star game is that the viewer gets to see some of the greatest MLB players the sport has to offer that some states in America and even other countries don't get the chance to watch . It always seems that the American League has the upper hand but I for one will never count out the National League . I am a huge Baseball fan and just love everything about the sport ! When the first moment on Joe Buck and company broadcast the game you know its gonna be an epic event ! If you are a Baseball fan and are able to watch this game on TV or even on tape do so because its a classic ! I recommend it !
Another good one !	When this show was on I watched it every time I could ! I thought that the characters were really funny and all had great personalities . The animation in My opinion was crisp , clean , and really clear . Not to mention beautiful ! Most of the characters in this show are hilarious like the Looney Tunes characters that we all love . in My opinion these characters are the funnies and talented ever seen . In fact , The things that goes on in this series ' cartoons are in My opinion nuts which that is what makes them hilarious ! There are so many to like and laugh at and the silly things they do ! If you like the original Looney Tunes then I strongly recommend that you watch this show !
Good one ! Very funny Three Stooges short !	The Three Stooges has always been some of the many actors that I have loved . I love just about every one of the shorts that they have made . I love all six of the Stooges ( Curly , Shemp , Moe , Larry , Joe , and Curly Joe ) ! All of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts ! In My opinion The Three Stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy team ! This is one of My favorite Three Stooges shorts with Curly ! All Appearing in this short are Bess Flowers , Lane Chandler , Vernon Dent , Bud Jamison , and Cy Schindell ! This one is so hilarious ! Curly has a great performance here and in My opinion its one of his best . I strongly recommend this Three Stooges short !
Great movie series !	The Crocodile Dundee series is a great one that's funny and exciting at the same time ! Paul Hogan and Linda Kozlowski are very good . I just like the scenes in the out back and and Hogan is hilarious in the city ! This series is very good and very entertaining . Check it out soon !
What in the world happened here ?	Submerged starring Steven Seagal ! Its his newest film released on DVD and I have very mixed emotions about it . I liked it because the camera effects were cool and the action was good and then I didn't like it . I'll go through the good and the bad below . THE GOOD 2 OK : The fights : YEAH ! ! ! Steven Seagal fights Gary Daniels ! Camera shots : The jumpy camera work was a cool feature to the movie . The actors : Steven Segal and Gary Daniels together in a film and they fight each other ! Is this a sign that other well known martial arts actors will be in Seagal's future movies ? William Hope and Vinny Jones have appearances . The two women were neat . THE BAD 2 WORST : Seagal's talking : He'd change his voice constantly to a light voice and then a deep voice and if that wasn't bad enough he'd change his accent like a southerner then to a cowboy and then back to the regular accent we're all used too . What the heck was up with that ? The fights : There was only a couple but they were OK because they weren't long I mean extremely brief ! Daniels was no match for Seagal as he got killed by Seagal . The big bodyguard guy was absolutely not even a sparing partner and the fight with him and Seagal ! I mean dang it , a guy like that should have lasted longer ! Nick Brimble : Was he trying be Jack Palance or thought he was him ? Plot : It was confusing as everything just jumped around back and fourth , back and fourth ! The color : The color kept on changing and changing ! Why ? The dialog : Examples : ( Gary Daniels : I'm taking over this Submerine now ! Steven Seagal : You're just gonna have to kill me I guess . . . ) ( Steven Seagal : Let me ask you a question . What kind of damn fool do you think I am ? I'm still in prison for doing the same thing you're about to ask me to do again ) . I thought a lot of the dialog was funny and I laughed at most of it . The camera work : Why was there so much camera effects ? It seemed funny because even when someone got killed they didn't fall like they should . Instead it seemed like they skipped a spaces and got to the ground earlier than you'd expect ? The opera concert : Hopw the conductor looked up and here and there when guys were getting killed . Surely everything that seemed funny was unintentional ? Right ? There many other points I could point out but there are too many of them . You may consider this film to be one of those that are so bad is its films . I would only recommend this film to people who like unintentional hilarious moments in films and of course Seagal completest and hardcore fans . Movie Nuttball's NOTE : If you are big Steven Seagal fan like Me then I strongly recommend you to check out these other great movies ! Above the Law , Hard to Kill , Marked for Death ( Must see because it great ! ) , Out for Justice ( Great ! ) , Under Siege , On Deadly Ground ( Really good ! ) , Under Siege 2 : Dark Territory ( Very good ! ) , The Glimmer Man ( In My opinion his all time best and one of the greatest films ever ! ) , Fire Down Below ( Excellent ! ) , The Patriot , Ticker , The Foreigner ( Surprising great ! ) , Out for a Kill , Belly of the Beast , and Into the Sun ( Great sword fighting ) !
This is a classic Dracula film !	Bela Lugosi is great as Dracula ! His castle is very scary and so dusty with bats , rats , and spiders ! There are some other films Bela plays Dracula and Dracula-type characters but this is to ME he best one of all . If you like all the current dracula films and other Universal Monsters classics and have not seen this yet then see it soon and make sure the sun is down when you do !
What's next to happen in that house ?	This is one of the great movies of the 80s in MY collection that I think about all the time . Some minor spoilersThis movie is scary . You never know what will happen in that house . William Katt moves back in his old house where strange things happen . Monsters and sorts of creatures pop up but when you see the flying skeleton bat creature with a human skull for a head watch out . That scene is scary . Look for Richard Moll in it as Big Ben . He is so cool in this movie . The songs in the movie is catchy and and the score is quite scary too ! This has 3 more sequels but the second one sequel is MY favorite one . Its House II - The Second Story . If you like a movie about haunted houses then is a movie ticket you are going to be scared to touch !

Great epic movie ! Gary Daniels puts on a great lead character !	This is one of the most coolest and exciting films I have ever seen ! The acting is very good , fights are great , the music is superb , and well , I can't say enough of Fist of the North Star ! Gary Daniels is great in this epic film . He really built his body up really well and I always thought his character resembled former WCW wrestler Scotty Riggs or by the name he went in ECW as Scotty Antwon . Speaking of wrestlers Former WCW champion and WWF ( which is now WWE ) star Vader appeared in a large scene and was excellent ! His name in the credits was Leon " Vader " White . Also in Fist of the North Star is another former WWF wrestler Ludvig Borga . In the credits his name was his real name , Tony Halme . He wasn't given a bigger role like Vader but it was cool to know he was there ! There are many other notable cast members such as Malcom McDowell which his voice , acting and presence made this film even more epic in My opinion . Costas Mandylor put on a very good performance . Chris Penn was good . Clint Howard and Nils Allen Stewart were good too . This is one of My favorite films and I feel Gary Daniels best . To bad his films lately hasn't been good as the Fist of the North Star . In the film he really made ME feel that he was a super hero and I loved the cloudy skies ! Check this one out today because I don't think you'll be disappointed !

Hayden , and Marc McClure ! The acting by all of these actors is very good . Williams is very good . The special effects and thrills is really good and some of it is surprising .

Missing in Action !	One of the most exciting Chuck Norris films is Missing in Action ! It stars Chuck Norris , David Hong , Lenore Kasdorf , and M . Emmet Walsh ! Norris is very different in this film . He is very serious and he acts very good . The other actors are good in the film as well . The action is just non-stop . The action is quite rough and action like this isn't seen often in movies especially in this day and age in My opinion . There are many other great scenes of Norris fighting shooting up the bad guys ! The music by Jay Chattaway is great . The direction by Joseph Zito is very good . If you like Chuck Norris and the cast member and want to see some great action then I strongly recommend that you watch Missing in Action !
My Science Project is a great movie ! One of the best movies of all time !	This is one of the great movies of the 80s in My collection that I think about all the time . My Science Project is one of My favorite films of all . The first time I saw I it I loved it ! Its still as great today as it was then ! What I love about it is for one how it was made ! The 80s allowed it to be a masterpiece ! The special effects are spectacular and I still think they are as good as the ones used currently ! I like the actors and the characters they play ! Fisher Stevens is hilarious ! John Stockwell played his part very good . Danielle von Zerneck and Raphael Sbarge put on good performances ! I really liked Richard Masur in the movie . His character Detective Jack Nulty was really a bad @ $$ and a ruthless one at that ! His accent and attitude was just so cool ! I always like to see Barry Corbin in the movie . Dennis Hopper's character Bob Roberts was colorful and intelligent ! This may sound strange but I believe My Science Project could be arguably his best movie ! The laughing bum character was funny ! Look for RoboCop's Robert DoQui and Big Trouble In Little China's Al Leong ! The budget of the film is big and I have always liked what it has in store ! Another thing I love about My Science Project is the score by Peter Bernstein ! The music fits the film perfectly and the theme it has is just phenomenally spooky ! Its so great ! In My opinion This movie has very good acting by the talented actors , a cool story , spectacular effects , a wonderful 80s feel , and just about anything that you could put in a movie ! I don't know why this classic movie hasn't received the attention it deserves I mean with all of the things it has I would think this movie would be considered one of the greats but sadly that hasn't happened . I personally think My Science Project is a classic movie that I believe is one of greatest of all time ! It is always great to watch . If anyone reads this and hasn't seen My Science Project before then I strongly recommend you go rent it and then buy it ! Its a true classic !
Following right after the classic Godzilla 1985 film , Godzilla returns with a vengeance in this great picture !

This Godzilla film is a great one . The story is very good and I really love the way Godzilla looks in this film . I love it when he roars and moves his tail . As for his enemy Biollante she too is awesome . I love it when she roars . The fights between the two monsters is really good . The acting by the film's human stars are also good . The music is just excellent ! I really love this Godzilla film for many reasons and its arguably the best ! If you love Godzilla I strongly recommend that you do what I did and buy Godzilla vs . Biollante today !

I love all six of the Stooges ( Curly , Shemp , Moe , Larry , Joe , and Curly Joe ) ! All of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts ! In My opinion The Three Stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy team ! One of My favorite Stooges shorts with Curly is A Plumbing We Will Go ! All appearing in this short are Symona Boniface , Monte Collins , Dudley Dickerson , Bess Flowers , Bud Jamison , Eddie Laughton , John Tyrrell ! There are so many funny parts here and the scenes with Bud Jamison are is really cool . There are two other Three Stooges shorts with Shemp very similar like this one called Vagabond Loafers and Scheming Schemers . A Plumbing We Will Go is a very hilarious short and I recommend it !

Star Trek : The Motion Picture ! ! ! !	The very first Star Trek film ever ! This is the film that started a big series of Star Trek ! Some fans of the original series or the future feature films may not like the storyline but the film has tremendous special effects and great acting by the original cast aswell as others . I think its a good film and has great music by Jerry Goldsmith ! Its a great start for one of the biggest and truly most arguably the greatest film franchise ever !
Hard Rain !	Hard Rain is a dandy of an action film ! Morgan Freeman , Christian Slater , Minnie Driver and especially Randy Quaid were all very good ! Edward Asner , Ray Baker , and Betty White were good ! Cool action ! Beautiful rain and lighting ! Great music by Christopher Young ! Hard Rain is a must see ! Strongly recommended !
Fantasia !	This is one of the most fantastic animated features of all time in My opinion ! Being a huge fan of movie music scores and classical music this is such an extraordinary movie to watch and enjoy . My favorite pieces in the film is the Nutcracker Suite , Rite of Spring , and Night on Bald Mountain / Ave Maria . These are three of the greatest pieces of music ever written in My opinion ! The animation is crisp , clean , and clear ! In fact , this animation is arguably better then today and there hasn't been any animation like the Night on Bald Mountain since in my opinion ! Disney did a fabulous achievement here ! So if you love Disney , the new fantasia 2000 animated feature , animated films in general , movie scores , and classical music then I strongly recommend that you head over to Amazon . com today and purchase this great animated movie today !

It has a an unusual casting which includes Harry Holman , Robert Graves , Bud Jamison , Mary Dees , Grace Goodall , Betty McMahon , Harriett De Bussman , Phyllis Crane , Geneva Mitchell , Kathryn McHugh , James C . Morton , William Irving , Arthur Rankin , Robert McKenzie , Celeste Edwards , and Blanche Payson . Along with George B . French , Gail Arnold , Don Roberts and Billy Mann . I like the scenes with Moe and Phyllis Crane and the dance scenes with Curly ! There are two other Three Stooges shorts similar like this one called Half-Wits Holiday with Curly and the other being Pies and Guys with Joe . Both are very good ! This one Hoi Polloi is very funny I recommend that you see it !
Very good movie !	This is a very good movie and I think that this film is very realistic how it was back then . The actress who looks almost exactly like Helen Hunt Leelee Sobieski stars as the title name and she has a powerful performance . Powers Boothe , Jonathan Hyde , Peter O'Toole , Robert Loggia , Shirley MacLaine , Maximilian Schell , Neil Patrick Harris , and Peter Strauss all put on great performances . The music in the film is very good . I think everything looks very realistic and there maybe few battles but all are good . Back to her performance , Sobieski acts very convincingly as Joan . This is a very good film that is emotional , interesting , and exciting and really shouldn't be missed by any big movie fan or fans of Gladiator and The Lord of the Rings trilogy . I strongly recommend this title !
Great Three Stooges Shemp short !	The Three Stooges has always been some of the many actors that I have loved . I love just about every one of the shorts that they have made .

Kenneth MacDonald and Tom Kennedy both performed excellently here ! The Stooges are great here and the entire short is hilarious ! Strongly Recommended !
The Puppet Masters in My opinion is a good alien film !	The Puppet Masters is a very good alien film . Donald Sutherland was good and it was unusual for male lead by Eric Thal . Julie Warner acted good and looked great ! Will Patton's role was very different . Richard Belzer was the same as always and Marshal Bell was good but I was kinda disappointed by the role they gave to Yaphet Kotto as he didn't do much . The music is great ! The Puppet Masters is a good alien film that is action packed and is never boring ! I think all fans of alien films will like this !

It Stars the huge Arnold , James Caan , the beautiful Vanessa Williams , the vertern actors James Coburn and Andy Romano , Robert Pastorelli , bad guys Patrick Kilpatrick and Sven-Ole Thorsen , and the legendary actor James Cromwell . It has a good story and it really has some great scenes including the air plane and zoo scenes ! The music by Alan Silvestri in it is pretty good ! I think this is one of his best movies and all Arnold fans should check this one out !
RoboCop is a great action movie !	RoboCop is a very good but violent film that in My opinion is not for kids . I say not for kids because unlike most films the violence it shows is very graphic . Though the film is somewhat sad but the film is never boring and has good acting . Peter Weller did an outstanding job being RoboCop ! Ronny Cox puts on a great performance but to me his role is similar to his role in Total Recall and Kurtwood Smith was good aswell . Miguel Ferrer was good and Nancy Allen looked good . Great music by Basil Poledouris and good direction by veteran director Paul Verhoeven . This is the first of a three film series . This is a great film for action and sci-fi fans alike !
Great classic !	I thought that the characters were really funny and all had great personalities . The animation in My opinion was crisp , clean , and really clear . Not to mention beautiful ! Most of the characters in this show are hilarious Looney Tunes characters that we all love . in My opinion these characters are the funnies and talented ever seen . In fact , The things that goes on in this series ' cartoons are in My opinion nuts which that is what makes them hilarious ! There are so many to like and laugh at and the silly things they do !

The acting is very good by Murray , Karen Allen , the late great Robert Mitchum , Carol Kane , David Johansen , Alfre Woodard , John Glover , John Forsythe Bobcat Goldthwait , and the rest of the good cast .

Hard Target is hard to beat ! ! !	Minor SpoilersA long time ago when this great movie was released I said we gotta see this ! As a big Van Damme fan I knew Hard Target was going to be good but I didn't think it was going to be in MY opinion a classic ! But really Van Damme isn't the only big star in Hard Target , it also stars Arnold Vosloo ( who later became a even bigger star as The Mummy in the Mummy and The Mummy Returns ) and Lance Henriksen ( who was Bishop in Aliens and in Alien 3 Bishop's creater ) . Vosllo is such a cool bad guy . His facial expressions and attitude make him such a cool guy and on the other hand Henriksen is also does a great acting job . Hard Target also includes the beautiful Yancy Butler and veteran actor Wilford Brimley . Hard Target and sports a special appearence by Sven-Ole Thorsen who is always a big bad guy in his movies . Hard Target has so much violence and action , any fan should be glad to see this shouldand there is no sex in it and that is a big plus for ME . Hard Target in MY opinion is Van Damme's best film to date but I also recommend some others for Van Damme fans like Blood Sport , Sudden Death , and Double Team . I hope you get a chance to see Hard Target because it is realy a awesome movie . By the way , I like how the end credits come , it starts with Credence Clear Water Revivel's Born on the Bayou ! ! ! Just excellent ! ! !
Snowbeast is a great film !	Important note : After comment please read notes below for buying options ! Snowbeast is an excellent Bigfoot film . The scenery of the snow is beautiful . I was amazed to see Bo Svenson , Robert Logan , and Clint Walker stood together as all three are very large men . Yvette Mimieux looked great ! This is one of the very few Bigfoort films that are good . My other favorite is Harry and the Hendersons but Snowbeast is a different story . This Bigfoot or Yeti or what ever you want to call him is very mean . You do get to see the huge monster . I think this is a very good film and it very hard to find on video and on T . V . but this film is worth having ! I recommend other Bigfoot films Harry and the Hendersons and Boggy Creek II ! Notes : For the people who are interested in buying Snowbeast on video go to the following web address http www bijouflix com index html They have a excellent selection on rare low budget films at great prices with super fast shipping and service ! This is a dream come true if you love this movie and were unable to seed it when it was T . V . This is what I believe the only way to find the film unless you find the three on one Creature Movies tape , which consist of Creature , The Track of the Moon Beast , and Snowbeast on Overstock . com ( look for more 3 on 1 tapes at Overstock . com and Amazon . com ! ) . MovieNuttball's Thoughts : Do I believe in Bigfoot , the Yeti , Sasquatch , and the Boggy Creek Creature ? Yes I do , I believe in all of the legendary creatures such as the Moth Man , the Lock Ness Monster , and the Jersey Devil . I believe they are out there !
Lethal Weapon 4 ! Great sequel !	The Lethal Weapon series is an explosive and exciting one that is always exciting with a lot of action and great acting from the stars . There's Lethal Weapon 1 , Lethal Weapon 2 , Lethal Weapon 3 , and Lethal Weapon 4 all starring great actors Mel Gibson and Danny Glover ! Also Joe Pesci and Rene Russo are in the later editions ! Steve Kahan , Paul Tuerpe , and Mary Ellen Trainor are in all four as well . Shane Black did a great job with the writing ! I also like how the series has the same composers Michael Kamen and Eric Clapton , producer , Joel Silver , and director Richard Donner has directed all four ! Lethal Weapon 4 ! It stars Mel Gibson , Danny Glover , Joe Pesci , Rene Russo , Chris Rock , and Jet Li ! Look for James Lew , Dana Lee , Danny Wynands , and Frank McRae ! Jet Li performed great as a tremendous villain ! There are some really neat action scenes and Gibson , Glover , Russo , Pesci , and Rock all put on excellent performances ! Pesci and Rock are hilarious in the film ! I think that Gibson and Russo make the perfect couple ! Great music by Michael Kamen and Eric Clapton ! I think Lethal Weapon 4 is great and is just as good as the first three . Looking for action and love Mel Gibson , Danny Glover and the rest of the cast ? Watch Lethal Weapon 4 today ! I strongly recommend it ! Movie Nuttball's NOTE : I really love the Lethal Weapon movies . I feel they are very special films and it is so good to see these great characters in more than one movie . I hope one day that they will make one last film and I would not mind another Lethal Weapon movie !

One of the greatest war films with the most realistic action ever !	Minor SpoilersThis is one of the greatest war films of all time and it deserves awards in my opinion ! Most people may not think this but Nicolas and Adam Beach deserves best actor and supporting actor awards in my opinion . Christian Slater was good but his role was reduced and its a shame that Jason Isaacs was in Windtalkers just for one scene because he has a great volume of potential and I feel he should have had a much bigger role . James Horner's score was good and the directing by John Woo was excellent . Windtalkers is one of the most realistic war film I have ever scene and the scenes with the planes is beautifully stunning ! I recommend this film to all war and action film fans alike !
Great Halloween feature !	This is a very good animated feature ! It's the Great Pumpkin , Charlie Brown is very funny and I am surprised it is still poplar today ! If you get chance to watch it then do so because it is really a classic and great for Halloween !
Conan the Destroyer is a good sequel !	Conan the Destroyer is more action and hero film than the first one . Ofcourse as always Arnold performes good and Wilt Chamberlain is huge ! It was so awesome to see a bigger man than Arnold in one of his films . Sara Douglas looks terrific . Mako is good . Look for Pat Roach , the legendary wrestler Andre the Giant , and Sven-Ole Thorsen in the movie . The film is never boring and it is arguably better the the prequel . The music is great by Basil Poledouris . I hope Arnold does make King Conan ! All fans of Arnold and sword fighting check this out soon !

Goldblum is Mister Frost !	I am writing this second comment to not only correct My mistake in the previous one but also to say some other things as well ! First off My mistake . I said in the beginning Jeff Goldblum looked like he did in the Fly . I was excited about writing the comment and I got mixed up . Nobody is perfect : ) Anyway In the beginning Goldblum had short hair and after one year into the film and until the movie is over he has long hair and that's when HE LOOKS like he did in the newer version of the Fly ! Now on to the film . I love how the film is . It is filmed uniquely . The music is very fitting and the movie can be scary . Jeff Goldblum plays Mr . Frost so good . In My opinion Goldblum is one of the best current actors and is one of the greatest actors ever ! He put so much character , emotion , evilness , depth , and energy into his role which is extraordinary ! Goldblum has become one of My favorite actors because he can do much with his characters ! As for the movie , its really a different one and I really don't want to say any more other than it is entertaining , spooky , memorable , and Goldblum is superb ! If you want to see Goldblum in a excellent movie that is creepy and spooky and are able to rent or even buy the rare Mr . Frost then do it because I recommend you watch this special movie !

Death Wish 3 !	The Death Wish films are some great movies . Charles Bronson is very good in them all especially the first and the third of the franchise . The first three are in My opinion the best in Death Wish series . In My opinion the films are not for young children . Its the trilogy directed by Michael Winner . The movies are packed with very realistic graphic violence , great music , good by acting the actors , and good directing . The third entry is arguably the best of the best of them all . Charles Bronson is great in the film ! His emotions are very believable ! is in the film . Ed Lauter and Gavan O'Herlihy are very good in this film .

If you like Charles Bronson and want to see him bust up some punks and like to see great revenge films with great action then watch Death Wish !
Arguably the best in the Star Trek series !	This is one of the great movies of the 80s in MY collection that I think about all the time . I love Star Trek . I have seen all of them many times but one of MY favorites it a the second film , The Wrath of Khan ! In MY opinion it has some of the best special effects ever seen even to this day ! The battles between the ships , the the computer images , and space itself . Ricardo Montalban is great as Khan and is a excellent villan . James Horner's score is terrific . All Star Trek fans , here is your movie !

A cool movie !	This film is very good but it is hilarious . Some of the monsters in it seem serious while others seem to have fun and act goofy ! The main villain Princess Dragon Mom is a unreal character but it works ! Infra Man is a good film and if you like Spectreman , Dynaman , and The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers then you'll love Infra Man !
The Neverending Story greatness will never be forgotten !	This is one of the great movies of the 80s in MY collection that I think about all the time . Some minor spoilersThis movie is a fantastic adventure . Great Special effects , characters , and story , and spirt flow with greatness . Most kids in movies are annoying but the ones in this movie arn't . The Wolf is so neat . I love how he talks and Falcor , The Luck Dragon , he is so funny and cute and the big Bat and and racing Snailing , well they are cute and funny aswell and the huge rock man but MY favorite one of all is giant turtle . He is awesome . I just love the senery in this film . The sky with the stars and the land is just simply gorgous . The Orical Statues ( gold ones ) are really scary . Every time I watch that scene it sends chills down MY back and makes you very nervous . Its unbelieveable how that scene was made . This is truly a great movie . Its one of the best movies I have seen . If you love ultimate fantasy films with just about everything you can think about then this movie you gotta see .
Serial Killer !	Serial Killer is a decent movie ! It keeps you going and I like how isn't a mystery and lets the killer be known plus it gives him a lot of time to do the things he does ! Anyway the cast is good and while I am really not familiar with Tobin Bell , he was very good as the serial killer ! Good music and story ! Recommended !
X-Men - In-depth Comment !	I have always liked the movie X-Men ! Its a serious movie with a deep story and a dark nature ! Ithas a very different cast and some incredible action ! The special effects are top notch ! The movie also has a unique score by Michael Kamen that fits this film perfectly ! Below in a small but In-depth look at the characters of the film . The X-MenHugh Jackman as Wolverine - There is not much information that is known about Logan or as he is called by another name which is Wolverine because of his hair and his raw fighting skills and not to mention his great sense of smell and like his arch nemesis Sabertooth , he too has an incredible healing rate ! He also has the outstanding ability to have three steel claws in each hand that comes through the knuckle area . He uses these thick blades for weapons and they do the task well ! What kind of mutant is Wolverine ? How can he possibly have this painful but yet great advantage that literally shoots out of his hands ? Will Professor X and his X-Men help Logan find out or will Wolverine have to find out on his own ? Patrick Stewart as Professor Charles Xavier - Professor X , The head of the School For Gifted Youngsters . He helps mutants with their powers by teaching them many things . He is a kind man and he seems to be more of a father or parent than a mentor . He is a very intelligent mutant and he can do many things with his mind ! In fact he just may have the most powerful mind on Earth . Unlike Magneto , Charles Xavier believes in peace ! James Marsden as Cyclops - Scott Summers has such powerful eyes he needs a special visor to control it . What causes this red beam is unknown and his visor helps him maintain this dangerous red light but he can control the beam with the help of a knob as he can adjust this to help him whenever he needs to use it however but without the special visor look out for an incredible blast ! He is also a skilled pilot ! Famke Janssen as Jean Grey - She also has a very powerful mind though she needs more time on how to master it with the help Professor X ! She likes Cyclops but she also cares about Logan . Halle Berry as Storm - This Egyptian beauty has the power to create all kinds of storms ! Ororo Munroe has long white hair and whenever she uses her great power her eyes turn white as well ! Anna Paquin as Rogue - She has the unusual power to drain the life out of anyone she touches ! She must wear gloves to prevent this from happening ! The BrotherhoodIan McKellen as Magneto . A very intelligent man that is Erik Magnus Lehnsherr . Where he hails from is unknown but what is known he has an extraordinary power that he can magnetize anything that is metal ! Whether its as small as a key or as large as a car it becomes no problem for Magneto ! Tyler Mane as Sabertooth - The huge maniac that is known as Sabertooth has incredible senses and is able to heal from injuries faster than anyone except Wolverine ! This giant lunatic loves to hear women scream and he has a passion to hear the scream or none other than Storm ! Victor Creed is a psychopath and with his long claws and razor sharp teeth he is out for blood ! Ray Park as Toad - The green skinned Mortimer Toynbee has a real long tongue and can grab a hold of an animal for lunch and also can use it to grab and use to swing out of danger . He has great leaping ability and fighting skills ! Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as Mystique - Though her real name is Raven Darkholme , she prefers to be called Mystique due to her mysterious shape shifting . The blue skinned woman can change exactly into anyone and even duplicate the clothes they wear ! She is incredibly agile and She has excellent fighting skills and she'll give the greatest fighters the planet has to offer a great challenge ! Other CharactersBruce Davison as Senator Robert Kelly - Unlike some people he is a believer in mutants and knows what they can do . He is captured by the lovely Mystique as it was a mission to her . Magneto shows the Senator what its like to be a mutant ! I really like the X-Men movie and I think Bryan Singer did a good job on the characters . Though X-2 is arguably better than this and I would love to have the X-Men franchise to spawn more than a trilogy . Though it may never happen but I think about this a lot that wouldn't it be awesome if they would have these great comic book characters together with other Marvel characters from movies like The Hulk , Spider-Man , Blade , The Punisher , & Daredevil ? Think of the epicness and possibilities ! I hope you have enjoyed this In-depth look at The X-Men !

A great movie !	The Prophecy is an excellent movie and is one of deepest films that I have seen . I won't give any info about the film except that the performance Christopher Walken was awesome ! Plus other good performances by Elias Koteas and Virginia Madsen ! Adam Goldberg and Amanda Plummer was OK . Eric Stoltz was great and his angel character is so likable . Viggo Mortensen was absolutely terrific ! The music is very good ! The Prophecy is a great film and has two other sequels but in My opinion they are nothing like this . I recommend every to see this film !
Looney Tunes : Back in Action is a great film !	I have always been a big Looney Tunes fan and I was thrilled about Who Framed Roger Rabbit being a live action film with animation . I also thought that Space Jam was cool and when I found out that another film very similar was coming out I was thrilled once again . Brendan Fraser , Jenna Elfman , Steve Martin , Timothy Dalton , Heather Locklear , Joan Cusack , Bill Goldberg , Don Stanton , Dan Stanton , Leo Rossi , and Ron Perlman stars in this film . I was amazed by this film ! All of these actors and actresses act very well . The animation on all of the animated characters is superb . Daffy Duck , Bugs Bunny , and the others are just as funny as ever ! There are so many cool Looney Tunes scenes and I just love the Bugs , Daffy , Elmer Fudd chase scenes ! The action is really good and is very exciting . I laughed at many of the things in this film which are just totally hilarious . The music by Jerry Goldsmith is excellent and the direction by Joe Dante is great ! I really love this film Looney Tunes : Back in Action ! I think everything is so great and its so wonderful that the classics has returned ! If you like the cast mentioned above , the classic Looney Tunes characters , films like Who Framed Roger Rabbit , and want to hear one of Jerry Goldsmith's best scores and like Joe Dante then I strongly recommend this film !
Good one !	This Stooge short is very spooky with the storms , wind , and everything ! Christine McIntyre is very good in this and as always she is very beautiful and she is My favorite actress in the Stooges episodes . Stanley Price and Philip Van Zandt put on good performances . This is a great one to watch during Halloween time !
Good Three Stooges short !	The Three Stooges has always been some of the many actors that I have loved . I love just about every one of the shorts that they have made . I love all six of the Stooges ( Curly , Shemp , Moe , Larry , Joe , and Curly Joe ) ! All of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts ! In My opinion The Three Stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy team ! This is a very good Three Stooges short and this was the very first one from Columbia Pictures ! The beautiful Jean Willes is in this one and she plays a very good part ! Emil Sitka is also in this one . The performances are very good in this one . There is another Three Stooges similar like this one with Curly called Gypped which is very funny . I recommend that you see Woman Haters ans also I recommend you see this one , Gypped in the Penthouse !
Good horror film !	The Devil Dog : Hound of Hell is really good film . It has good acting by the cast including Richard Crenna and R . G . Armstrong . The music is spooky and gives that devilish chill ! I liked the effects on the dog and I think the creature itself looked really cool with its horns , frill like part on his neck , and acted really viscous ! If you like horror films and haven't seen The Devil Dog : Hound of Hell before and are able to find and buy this rare film then do so because its a good movie and I don't think you'll be disappointed !

Salem's Lot !	This here is a very good movie . I think its one of Stephen King's best ! The cast is all good which includes David Soul , James Mason , Ed Flanders , and many others . The vampire effects and make up look superb ! I love the spooky setting that it has and Tobe Hopper's directing is great ! The music by Harry Sukman is very good and fits the film nicely !

Great John Carpenter movie !	John Carpenter's Village of the Damned in My opinion is one of his best and darkest films ! The cast was really good which includes Christopher Reeves , Mark Hamil , Kirstie Alley , Linda Kozlowski , Michael Paré , and Peter Jason ! I really liked Christopher Reeves and Mark Hamil's characters especially Hamil's . I don't know but there is just something about his character that is unique . The film is top notch with excellent music and direction by John Carpenter ! If you are a Carpenter fan and love horror movies then I recommend Village of the Damned ! Movie Nuttball's note : It was so cool to Christopher Reeves and Mark Hamil in a movie together . It was like Luke Skywalker from Tatooine and Superman from Krypton joining each other for a movie ! It is really cool to check out !
Great intelligent mummy movie !	This is My second comment on the film . Tale of the Mummy is really decent and yet one of the most different of all mummy films . Christopher Lee has a short but very good part in the film . He actually shows a side of himself that is rarely seen on screen . Jason Scott Lee performed well and his relationship with Louise Lombard was good but it didn't go to the distance it could have because of the situation . Sean Pertwee put on a very act in the film . A very troubled but serious character . Shelley Duvall , Michael Lerner , 007's Honor Blackman , Jon Polito , and Gerard Butler was in this as well ! As for the movie itself it is very interesting from start to finish . The Mummy is very different and I like the way he changed into many forms in the film and when he came into formation at the end it is really scary . The music in the film is excellent . I really don't know what else to say . Tale of the Mummy is a good mummy movie that doesn't disappoint and if you have a chance check it out !
Good violent movie !	Conan the Barbarian is a very violent sword fighting movie that puts Arnold in alot bad situations . James Earl Jones is a bad villain here and his performance is good . Arnold packs a punch here also and Sandahl Bergman looks stunning ! Max von Sydow is good as always and Sven-Ole Thorsen looked menacing like he always does ! The score is awesome by Basil Poledouris . Conan the Barbarian has a sequel that is just as good as this called Conan the Destroyer ! If violent sword fighting is what you like then watch this great Arnold film soon !
