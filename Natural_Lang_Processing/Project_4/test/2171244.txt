Waste of my time	I have absolutely no idea why I watched Ali G Indahouse except for the fact that Salon seemed to think a crime was committed by not nominating Sacha Baron Cohen for a Emmy for his work on Da Ali G Show . It is a sure bet that I will never watch that show as there was absolutely nothing funny about the movie . Comedy ? Torture was more like it . It was just about the stupidest thing I every watched . I will admit that I was captivated by Rhona Mitra . I had not seen her in anything . She wasn't on The Practice during the time I was watching , so I guess I will have to check out Boston Legal one of these evenings to see how she does in something that may be worth watching .
Yawn	" The first days were uneventful ; monotonous and tedious . " This is Dr . Fran Parrish ( Paul Langton ) as he treks through the Himalayas searching for plant life . Soon we expect the monotony to evaporate as a Yeti attacks and carries off a village girl . But , we are soon disappointed as we go on a tedious and monotonous trek up the mountains in search of the Yeti . At least when we are trekking through the jungle , we have animals to look at . Trekking through the Himalayas , we have only snow and ice . But success eventually comes and the Yeti is captured and taken back to Los Angeles . Unfortunately , it escapes , and our tedious monotonous search begins again . We end up in the sewers of Los Angeles . I would have thought given the Yeti's proclivity for women , that he would head for Hollywood in search of starlets , but , alas , it was not to be . The entire film was uneventful , monotonous and tedious .
Please , no sequel !	This was bad enough . I really hope that there is no sequel . Maybe that is giving away part of the plot to let you know that it is open to the possibility , but no , it really isn't . There is really not at all special about this movie . Well , the special effect were fairly good , but nothing to write home about . There were some hot babes in her , especially Elina Madison and Alexandra Ford , but nothing to see folks . PG-13 , definitely not an R . That also tells you the slasher aspects were less than spectacular . The shovel to the head was the only thing that was unusual . Tame scare fare .
Get your spirits in a bottle .	The worst terror I can imagine is having Playboy model Beverly Lynne on top of me and then have her turn into some crone dressed as a nun . That would scare the hell out of me ! But , that is what happened in David's ( Charlie David ) dream . It seems that he and Julie ( Lynne ) moved into a haunted house - haunted by a nun ! Why ? We never find out in this film that really turns into a bore . Their friends come over that night and basically just get drunk and make fools of themselves . The killer nun is getting rid of them one by one in what can only be described as very amateur gore . There is hardly a quart of blood used in the whole film , and that includes a shower scene with Lynne where she imagines blood flowing all over her . We have Jennifer Amanda Morgan , a very hot Yvette Lopez , and Lindsey Labrum all at the party and we have zero action . What a bummer ! If you want to see has over 60 appearances that seem to over good possibilities . Films like Kinky Sex Club , Bikini Chain Gang , and Emmanuelle Tango . Check those out and leave this one alone .
But I'm not gonna be gone , EVER	This is not going down as one of the all-time greats . Hey , I was just looking for a Danny Trejo fix until Machete comes out . He played a don't-give-a-damn cop here that was not as raw as I usually see him . His partner , before she transferred to Homicide , was the ever luscious Roselyn Sanchez , who plays Elena on " Without a Trace . " She is the feature of this movie , except for , of course Nightstalker and his ever-present buddy , Demon . I only mention them in passing as they are the main characters . They really don't do much . Everything is pretty much off-camera here and the movie deserved no more that a PG-13 rating for the violence . There was no sexuality , despite the MPAA claim . I doubt they even watched it as they would be immediately put off by the Death Metal music and the absolutely irritating camera work that was supposed to show what the Nightstalker was seeing and feeling as he operated high on crack . I suppose that was the intention ; it was just plain irritating . Maybe they though the Satanic symbols were too much for the little ones , and they didn't want to be accused of offending someone's religion . Who knows ? I got my Trejo fix , and got to see Sanchez ( always fully clothed ) , so who cares . Danny Trejo was a co-producer of this film . Tood bad he didn't remember his other 138 films and give us more reason to watch .
That's it , no more Mr . Nice Duck .	After watching Cobra , I got the opportunity to see the film that beat it for worst picture of 1986 . I wish I hadn't ! Of course , it was not only the worst picture , but the worst screenplay and worst visual effects . It was also nominated for worst director and worst original song , and Tim Robbins got a worst supporting actor nomination for his part . believe me it deserved every accolade it got . Of course , if it wasn't for Mommie Dearest , it would have been the worst picture in the 80s . Of course , the time wasn't a total loss as Lea Thompson ( Back to the Future , Back to the Future II ) was a delight to watch . George Lucas must be hanging his head in shame .
Would you like some wine with this cheese ?	Remember the video nasty called Blood Feast . it was banned in Britain , and finally let in in 2005 . This film is a cheesy remake of the Herschell Gordon Lewis classic . It was banned and never let in . Instead of an Egyptian goddess , this guy here ( William Metzo ) is making sacrifices to some Aztec goddess . He takes a prostitute ( Laura Misch Owens ) home , oils her up , and performs his ritual , which includes removing her heart . The cop ( Curt Dawson ) is too busy getting prostitutes ( Gwen Arment ) in bed himself to solve the crime . I really don't get this police sergeant strolling though the city with his arm around the prostitute . While he is in bed , another girl gives her heart to the slasher . This doesn't make the police chief too happy as Mardi Gras is about to start and they need to get Jaws out of the water . Sorry , wrong film . Cheesy dialog , hairy men in wife-beaters , incompetent cops , and a score that belongs in a porno film : all the elements of a good grade Z grindhouse film .
Have you heard the reports of a " giant lizard " ?	Sody pop and hot rods and teen lingo . This is definitely a movie out of the 50s . No snakes or dinosaurs or alligators , but a giant gila monster snaking on delicious people . Sheriff Jeff ( Fred Graham ) is at a loss and the town bigwig ( Bob Thompson ) is on his case . But , there is one teen ( Don Sullivan ) around that seems to have the knowledge and gumption to do something . For his first two films Ken Curtis ( " Gunsmoke " ) calls on special effects whiz Ray Kellogg ( The Green Berets , The Killer Shrews ) to direct his own story . Not a bad tale for the time .
Come and get me pumpkin man .	OK , I could only find three reasons to consider this film worthwhile considering the extremely low budget . First there was Linnea Quigley and Rachel Carter . Actually , the two of them gave me four good reasons to watch , and watch I did . The only other reason to watch is that a lot of was filmed right down the road . Now , I didn't know this beforehand , but I saw an Orange County car tag and said , wow ! this was shot in Florida . I was impressed by the flashback to the past and the ancestors of the young kid , but that was really it . The killings by the pumpkin man were pretty lame , with the exception of the biker . If you want to see Quigley and Carter , OK , but Return of the Living Dead will give greater thrills .
Bad Art	I tuned into this because of the director , Terry Zwigoff ( Bad Santa ) despite being warned that it was not worth watching . I should have heeded the advice as it was not worth watching . It wasn't a complete waste , but when I want to see an artist who wants to be successful to get a girl , I can probably check the local junior highs as that is the level of Jerome's ( Max Minghella ) motivation . I am certainly not motivated to see any more of Minghella's work as I found nothing particularly interesting about him . Ditto the object of his desire , Audrey ( Sophia Myles ) , who displayed as much emotion as a still life . There were plenty of interesting characters in this film - John Malkovich , Jim Broadbent , and Anjelica Huston played those , but there was also an abundance of boring characters , and a plethora of lousy acting , mostly by the cops .
Secret Gitmo training film ?	This video nastie was initially banned , but allowed release without any cuts . Supposedly it was the cover and the subject matter that was found offensive , and not the actual film . Of course , many would find the film offensive . It was poorly shot , had no real actors , had really boring sex scenes , and was just a cheap naziplotation film . I have not been able to confirm that this was used as training material for the torturers at Gitmo . The limited torture in the film would probably not make it of much use . There was no water-boarding , for example , but there was an interesting use of boiling / freezing water . If you are looking for a cheap film that makes extensive use of full frontal nudity , this may be just the thing . If you love Bush , then you will find a forest here .
My name is Jack Carter , and you don't want to know me .	If you are going to watch this you either need to have a barf bag ready or a gun to kill yourself for being so stupid . Remakes are a big warning sign that Hollywood has run out of ideas . They seldom work , and , even if they are good , they are unfavorably compared with the original . Don't tell me about The Departed . It isn't even close to being as good as the original . Now , having said that , why in the world would you want to do a remake with Sylvester Stallone ? You already have two strikes against you and you just let the pitcher have a freebie . I loved Cop Land , and that is probably the best he will ever do . It called for someone that was five beers short of a six pack emotion-wise . Here you have a guy seeking revenge for his brother and you see that same lack of emotion . Why bother ? It did have Miranda Richardson ( Tom & Viv , Damage ) and the lovely Rhona Mitra and Sir Michael Caine in a wasted role . No other reason to watch except for a dynamite car chase .
While I live , while my blood burns hot , your daughter is not safe in her tent .	The John Wayne marathon . Now , this is real Grindhouse fare . the lines in this film are comparable to such classics as Satan's black Wedding or Diary of a Nymph . John Wayne as Ghengis Khan ! I would not waste time talking about this film as i don't recommend anyone seeing it , but there is an interesting story behind it . It was filmed in Utah . The military had been doing atomic bomb testing near the location before the film , and the area was still hot . Several of the people involved with the film - over 100 - died of cancer . I kid you not : John Wayne : lung & stomach cancer , Susan Hayward : brain cancer , Pedro Armendáriz : suicide , after learning he had cancer , Agnes Moorehead : uterine cancer , and John Hoyt : lung cancerTose were main characters . The rest of the deaths were crew .
Are those tearaway nipples ready yet ?	Well , we don't need Tropic Thunder to parody Hollywood when we have this movie that spoof low budget B-movies . Linnea Quigley , or just plain Linnea , as she is now billed , stars as a scream queen under contract to Faraday Pictures for " six films or six week , whichever comes first . " She mostly runs around the set topless . Delia Sheppard , who long lost of credits include " protesting war widow " in Born on the Fourth of July , and " party girl " on Any Given Sunday , plays the sex bomb wife of Faraday , who is trying to kill him ( they have a prenup , you see ) . Lots of goofy fun as the whole Hollywood scene is made fun of .
Miike finally disappoints	I have seen some very good work from Takashi Miike - Ichi the Killer , Graveyard of Honor - but this was a real disappointment . There were only a few instances of fighting and two were a real disappointment . The basic story is simple . A failed boxer and minor thug named named Junpei ( Daisuke Nagakure ) decides to take a Yakuza group's money and run . He gets caught and sent to prison after hiding the money . When he gets out of prison , he hires Kiba ( Takeshi Yamato ) to go get the money with him so he can return it and free his girl . Only he doesn't know she is with someone else now . Did he think she was going to wait for him ? There was one instance where one Karate master took on seven with various weapons . The whole thing was over in a minute ! At the end , there was a Rocky / Apollo Creed match between the bodyguard and a local cop . It lasted 30 seconds ! There was just too little action and too much talking .
Deal with the Devil	This was a very interesting film about a man , Darren ( Brian Prost - All Wrapped Up ) who has three minutes to decide to make a deal with what was obviously the devil . He sustained injuries that would put him in a vegetative coma . We assume he signed the contract , as he lives and we see him a month later . But Darren does not seem to be happy . Does he regret the deal ? It does not appear that he has been asked to do anything , but a waitress ( Nicole 11 : 11 ) that served him and his wife ( Debbie Rochon ) turns up dead . What rotten timing ! She dies just as she was about to remove her bra . I have to call that lousing directing on the part of writer / director Neil McCurry , and the reason it was not rated higher . But , things are not what they seem and soon ( as this is a short ) we know the real truth about the deal with the devil .
Unless , of course , you'd rather be buried here , as a ceiling fan or something .	Although I was disappointed in this film for the most part , it had some parts that were really good . I can't give it a recommendation as a horror film . I would have never watched it had I know it was another Twilight . I am not interested in horror stories for tweens . Whether vampires or werewolves , these stories demand an R rating to be credible . I am not interested in Romeo and Juliet for the wolf set . The transformation into wolves in the forest was incredible , and the best part of the movie . The second best part was when Rafe died . Agnes Bruckner ( The Peaceful Warrior , The Woods ) was worth seeing again .
You know what I am . . . a lot better than I do .	There is nothing new here . Demon Hunter is a goofy , low-budget flick that wouldn't look out-of-place as a " movie of the week " on the Sci-Fi Channel . hey ! It is on this Friday . Unfortunately , it would have to be cut to just an hour after the sex scenes are removed - and that's with commercials ! Sean Patrick Flanery ( Into the Fire , Kiss the Bride , Simply Irresistible ) does a credible job as the demon hunter in a kind of Blade / Constantine remake . He the church's Michael Clayton , who comes in to fix messes when exorcisms go wrong . He is helped by Colleen Porch ( All In , Transformers , I Know Who Killed Me ) , a nun ( who kinda looks like Angelina Jolie ) who is definitely not cut out for this work . He is fighting one of the evilest looking characters in the movies , Billy Drago ( The Hills Have Eyes ( 2006 ) , Mysterious Skin , The Untouchables ) , who is trying to create some evil spawn . He is assisted by a knockout , Tania Deighton ( Something's Gotta Give ) , who needs to be in a lot more movies . Lots of skin and some good fighting , but no FX . You've seen it all before .
Washington is just so cool in this film	A good film noir by Carl Franklin ( One False Move ) , with great cinematography by Tak Fujimoto ( " John Adams " , The Sixth Sense ) . Denzel Washington is fantastic as ' Easy ' Rawlins , with Don Cheadle as his buddy , Mouse . They battle Tom Sizemore in their quest to find Daphne Monet ( Jennifer Beals ) . You have the look and feel of the 30s throughout with the costuming , the cars , the talk , the cops , and the feel of the movie . It was a great nostalgia trip . Lisa Nicole Carson ( " Ally McBeal " ) also added some excitement before her premature death . This was based on the first of Walter Mosely's Easy Rawlins books , and it is a good one .
The world is full of talented assholes .	Love , hate , jealousy , desire sometimes work together with disastrous consequences . Kathryn Bigelow put together an interesting story based on a novel using these themes . Action bounced back and forth between the present with Catherine McCormack , Sean Penn , Elizabeth Hurley & Josh Lucas ; and the past featuring Sarah Polley . A murder took place in 1873 and there is no doubt watching the action that Polley committed it . Unfortunately , a man hangs for the crime instead of her . The present day crew with McCormack doing a great job as a photographer investigating the murder seem to be having some of the same problems that beset Polley . Her husband ( Peen ) can't seem to take his eyes off Hurley ( and who could blame him as she exposes ample skin to distract us should the story lag - which it doesn't ) , and there is some indication that more might have happened . Just as things came to a head with Polley and a moment of madness overtook her , we can see the same things happening in the present . The murdered are still be discussed 100 years later and only a couple of people know what really happened . We can also look at the present situation and discuss what went on in the minds of the characters in the storm . It leaves room for doubt , and that is what makes this an interesting story , besides , of course , McCormack's and Polley's performances .
Goddess Diana , fail you I will . / I was to bring you fresh sperm from my Bill . / I had him erect and his semen would follow . / Alas , I was hot . So hot that I swallowed .	Now , this just happens to be the wackiest movie I have ever seen . It was actually four movies in one , but it was still over the top . Maybe they should have called it Hotel , je t'aime , as it feature four directors : the Grindhouse pair Quenton Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez ; Sugar Town and TV director , Allison Anders ; and Jennifer Beals ex , Alexandre Rockwell . Beals was in two of the four stories , and the cast list has a lot of favorites . There was Ione Skye showing off her assets as a witch who failed in her mission until Ted the Bellhop ( Oscar-nominated Tim Roth - Rob Roy , Planet of the Apes ) helped her out . There was Salma Hayak featured on TV . There was a slick Antonio Banderas . There was Marisa Tomei and Bruce Willis . Those are my favorites , and I am sure that many can find their's in those I didn't list . There was even Razzie favorite Madonna as an incestuous mother . A little bit of everything for those with a twisted sense of humor and a broad mind .
Adventures with Emanuelle	I really can't understand why this film is not on the list of the 1001 Films You Must See Before You Die . One simply has to watch at least one Emanuelle film to say they are familiar with 70s sleaze . As an undercover reporter , Emanuelle ( Laura Gemser ) never hesitates to strip down and get under covers to get a story . Of course , this is America , so she will find all sorts of sleaze ; enough to shock even her . Mr D'Amato does not have to waste a lot of money on wardrobe in his films . Everywhere you go girls are lying around naked . When they do get in the pool , they have all sorts of fun with each other . We even see a woman and a horse - not all the way , of course . That would make it porn . That is the way most sex scenes are ; they stop just short of porn , although some do cross the line . There are even snuff films and torture porn , and then she sees the real thing . If America isn't your cup of tea , you can catch Emanuelle in many other places in other film : Japan , Africa , Egypt , the Amazon , in prison , even in Hell .
Where the hell is my elephant ?	One would not think that an elephant would be so important that someone would travel from Thailand to Austrailia to find one - or two - but , apparently they are something special to Khan ( Thai Warrior's Tony Jaa ) . Unlike the PC martial arts in Super Hawk , the action here gets downright bone cracking . Reminisent of Jet Li , Khan can take on a couple of dozen without breaking a sweat , but breaking bones along the way . But , it is those big suckers that he has to fight that really make things interesting . I didn't know that they made them that big ! There isn't much story except for the quest for his elephants , so everything is put into the martial arts . BMX and roller blade fans can appreciate the warehouse fight , while the water fight in the temple gives a view of different martial arts styles . If you like your action almost continuous and highly stylized , then this is for you . Expect much much more from Jaa .
Rings of garlic . . . holy water . . . silver stake . . . crucifix . . .	The opening to this movie was classic . I really liked seeing the villagers storming the castle to kill Dr . Frankenstein and his creation . But , what was Dracula doing there ? We quickly switch to a really strange Jekyll / Hyde that looks something out of Jack and the Beanstalk , and a secret order of the Catholic Church that employs Van Helsing ( Hugh Jackman ) to fulfill their mission of stamping out evil in the world ( minus the priests that prey on boys , of course ) . There is even a James Bond type Q Branch with new weapons . It is obvious that this is not going to be your father's Dracula / Van Helsing movie . The action is fast , the costuming , sound , CGI , and makeup are first rate . Dracula is brought into the 21st Century with a bang . But , is that bang worth the time ? Well , the fire works were amazing and the flying creatures were stunningly beautiful . There was even a " Birds " segment with bats instead really cool . Shuler Hensley made a great Frankenstein's Monster , and , of course , there is always Kate Beckinsale , a welcome sight in any movie . Mummy master Stephen Sommers wrote and directed an exciting film .
You're just floored because you like to see naked chicks .	Herschell Gordon Lewis who gave us the video nastie Blood Feast , and came back years later with a follow up , Blood Feast 2 : All U Can Eat , originally did this film in 1970 . Jeremy Kasten gives us this remake with The Suicide Girls and Bijou Phillips ( Hostel Part 2 ) . Add in very good performances by Kip Pardue ( Remember The Titans ) , Crispin Glover ( Beowulf , Back to the Future ) , and Brad Dourif ( The Lord of the Rings : The Two Towers , " Deadwood " ) and you have a film worth watching . I like the cultish Suicide Girls , and I was mesmerized by the story which sometimes had my head spinning . I plan to see the original , and I want to see more Jeremy Kasten .
You sure he's a guy ? If it's a women , she could be my soulmate .	This film brings up all sorts of interesting questions . Are we accomplices if we watch murder being committed on the Internet . Will we eventually see executions online ? What are the limits of the net ? All this is interwoven in an exciting police chase for a mentally unstable individual who is seeking revenge for what he considers unreasonable use of the net . Of course , the motive takes while to figure out and , in the meantime , we are treated to a Saw / Hostel type of entertainment as murders do take place in view of the public . Diane Lane is very good as the FBI agent trying to solve this cyber crime . We all know how these movies end - no surprises there , but it was fun being along for the ride .
Always count your bullets , senoritas	Luc Besson has given us many exciting films . He was writer and director of The Professional with Jean Reno ; writer of Kiss of the Dragon , The Transporter , and Danny the Dog ; and producer of those and many more like The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada . Now , he has written this for Salma Hayek and Penélope Cruz . It's a cute film that is just one that you sit back and enjoy . It's a different kind of western ; one that gives us ample opportunity to just enjoy the incredible beauty of these two women . With Steve Zahn , Dwight Yoakum , and Sam Shepard along for the ride , the laughs keep coming . It's pure popcorn fun , and even has a girl-fight between the two beauties . Unfortunately , the Padre stopped it before it got interesting . Catch it on cable for some laughs .
A B-movie romance with excellent singing	Mario Lanza only did 10 movies , and only two with Kathryn Grayson . She could not get along wt him due to his temper and alcohol abuse . That is a real shame as the two together on the Oscar-nominated " Be My Love " was pure magic . ( It lost to " Mona Lisa " in another crash of Academy voters . ) Current moviegoers can hear Lanza sing in Zodiac or The Polar Express , but why settle for one song when you can enjoy a half dozen by this wonderful tenor . Those who think of Pavarotti when they think of tenors , will be surprised by Lanza's looks . He is more like Sly Stallone with good looks that the typical rotund singer . This movie was a joy to behold as it was funny and sweet . The great David Niven ( Separate Tables , Eye of the Devil ) was fantastic .
A horror western	Just combining horror and westerns makes this film an interesting watch . There is not a great amount of blood and gore , but enough to make it interesting . We could have seen more of Nicki Aycox ; that would have made it more interesting . The acting is good for a direct-to-DVD film . Henry Thomas ( Indictment : The McMartin Trial , E . T . : The Extra-Terrestrial ) and Isaiah Washington ( " Grey's Anatomy " ) did very good jobs . The story is familiar : nasty things go on in a house and our thieves just happen upon it . The ghosts of the past return to claim more victims . Nothing new there except for the western twist . Worth a watch .
Another remake - yawn !	Why do they do it ? Just because a film was made once in the fifties , someone thinks they need to remake it with today's hot stars . At least they could improve on the story . The most glaring hole in this version is the fact that the father ( Max von Sydow ) hired a private detective to investigate the boyfriend of his daughter , and yet he declined to investigate the boyfriend of his other daughter , both played by Sean Young , which would have exposed the plot . Matt Dillon plots to have it all and has to do some things that just stretch us beyond belief to get there . He just seems to be in the right place at the right time just once or twice too often for my tastes . I fell in love with Sean Young when she did No Way Out back in 1987 . I haven't seen much of her lately and understand that she has not been doing so well . I thought she was good in this role and think that she has been unfairly criticized . Still , I believe film noir is best watched in films of the fifties and remakes just don't do it for me .
The blood of these whores is killing me .	Udo Kier has 180 roles to his credit . Most recently he was in Grindhouse and Rob Zombies Halloween . But , it is his roles in Andy Warhol's Frankenstein and this film that really show him at his campy best . Here , he plays Count Dracula , a man we really feel sorry for , as he only has two weeks to live unless he can find a virgin's blood to drink . he travels to Italy with his manservant ( Arno Juerging ) to the château of a Marchese ( Vittorio De Sica ) who happens to have four daughters ranging from an old maid to a 14-year-old , and a gambling problem that has left him almost penniless . He welcomes the Count ( and his wealth ) to choose one of his daughters for marriage . What he does not know is that the one servant he still has on staff ( Joe Dallesandro ) has been using more that rakes and shovels . He has a special tool that is admired by the two middle daughters and , suffice it to say , they are no longer virgins . Count Dracula finds this out the hard way . Who knew that he was bulimic ? He throws up a disgusting amount of blood after noshing on their necks . The servant figures out what is happening and rapes the 14-year-old to save her from the vampire . Isn't he a thoughtful guy ? But , the spinster saves Dracula temporally until the servant used an ax to turn him into a quadriplegic before putting the stake through his heart . Despondent , the spinster falls on the stake also to be with her love forever . What a sweet story of love .
The end of Virgil Tibbs	We first met Virgil Tibbs waiting for a train in Sparta Mississippi In the Heat of the Night . For those that didn't know , he reminded us in They Call Me MISTER Tibbs . Now , he had his badge taken away after no keeping his Captain informed as he fought The Organization in San Francisco . Maybe the hippie thing is getting tired : calling police " pigs , " and the weird dress , and constant " man " ' s , or maybe Tibbs is getting tired , but this was just a fair viewing of Sidney Potier as Virgil Tibbs . Well , at least he is still married to the same woman ( Barbara McNair ) , and I always like seeing Raul Julia ( Moon Over Parador , Kiss of the Spider Woman ) , there is " Superfly " ( Ron O'Neal ) , Daniel J . Travanti when he was Dan Travanty , and Max Gail , whom I remember from " Barney Miller . " Sidney Potier is always worth watching and you might have an additional favorite above .
Yell all you like - the Lord himself won't hear you .	So , this is an adaptation from a video game . Maybe that is part of the problem . It just didn't have any soul . It was cold and mindless and exciting , but the sets looked as if they came from a video game , and there was more shooting than performing . Compare that to Jason Statham in Crank or Clive Owen in Shoot ' Em Up ; both had lots of action , but they also had characters we cared about and something of a story to follow . They had a soul . Timothy Olyphant was pleasurable , but didn't have much to work with . Ukrainian Olga Kurylenko ( Paris , je t'aime ) was an interesting character , not just for her casual dress , but she was someone you cared about . There should have been more like her . We'll get to see more of her in Quantum of Solace , and I look forward to that . The formula for the movie is entertaining , but more needed to be done .
Maryam d'Abo's debut !	This video nastie was banned in Britain , but released uncut four years later . The main feature is the motion picture debut of Maryam d'Abo ( The Living Daylights ) . This Bond girl gives us what we can never see in those PG-13 pictures . If we saw this in Bond , they would be classic ! This is the only full frontal film of d'Abo , but she shows her breasts and bush in several other films . This is the only Sci-Fi video nastie as far as I know , and it is exciting . The creature is about as scary as you can imagine . After disappearing for three years , Sam ( Philip Sayer ) returns subsequent to a rape by the creature and a live birth as an adult . Bet that was painful ! Naturally , she dies in the process . He has returned to get his son , and off they go getting ready for Xtro 2 and 3 . Sorry , they don't include d'Abo , so they are probably not as good as this one . Also includes Peter Mandell as a clown . He went on to become an Ewok in his next film .
Wasp Woman meets Robo Cop	It is amazing what you'll find at 4am . This was certainly one that I should have skipped and tried to get back to sleep . It's far into the future and on a mining camp the robots are loose . They are cute little things that look like doggie-sized metal T-Rexs . Got the picture . But they also can assume human shape . So watch out . Your best friend may not be real . Better see if he bleeds . Peter Weller ( RoboCop ) didn't have Nacy Allen around to help him , so he relied on Jennifer Rubin ( Roger Corman's Wasp Woman ) . They made a nice pair , but he still cut her hand to check if she bled . She kissed him after that . What a woman will do when there are no other men around ! Lots of shooting at these screaming robots , but not much else .
Don't let the vampires get you .	In the same year that she was Ann Darrow in the clutches of King King , Fay Wray made this little gem where vampires were traveling through the village killing people . She really appears to be quite good and worth looking further into her 117 film catalog . Of course , multiple Oscar-winner Melvyn Douglas ( Hud , Being There ) was having none of this until he could find no other explanation for several murders . A local dimwit was suspected and when there was another death after the townspeople drove him to death , Douglas knew there was another explanation . Just like the butler always does it , there is always a mad scientist ( Lionel Atwill ) about doing crazy experiments if you just look hard enough . Another gem found among the Bs .
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned .	TV / Movie actor Tim Guinee ( Iron Man , Blade ) was the focus of this episode . His smarmy character that enchanted the ladies with his quiet voice and " aw shucks " manner got him out of most scrapes across the country . He managed to best Jack McCoy ( Sam Waterston ) and escape justice once again , but he finally met his match in the sweet thing ( Catherine Wolf ) on the jury that he conned . Peter McRobbie , as Judge Bradley has been on all of the Law & Order spin-offs , and a dozen episodes of Law & Order . He is no nonsense and really adds to the show .
A mother shouldn't kill her baby .	Another very good episode featuring the best assistant D . A . , Serena Southerlyn ( Elisabeth Röhm ) . An old acquaintance of Serena's , Diane Payton ( Ellen McLaughlin ) tries to make her career by defending her aunt and manipulating Serena into helping her get information she couldn't get otherwise . Fortunately , Serena manages to catch her in a lie that leads to a conviction . Jack McCoy ( Sam Waterston ) is his usual competent self as he manages to tear apart the mother and get that conviction . Lt . Van Buren ( S . Epatha Merkerson ) was especially good in this episode .
" This fortress - built by nature for herself ; This blessed plot , this Earth , this realm , this England . "	I watched two very different Holmes adventures this morning , but you would be amazed at the similarities . The was presumably the first collaboration between Basil Rathbone ( If I Were King , Romeo and Juliet ) and Nigel Bruce , and director Roy William Neill . It was not their first Sherlock Holmes adventure , as they did one a couple of years before this . The made an excellent team , but I prefer the Hammer version , which I will talk about later . Holmes relies on a lot of disguises to do his work , and I am constantly amused by the mannerisms displayed when they figure something out . They always seem to dash on when they find a new clue . The story itself about keeping a bomb site from the Germans in WWII was interesting and kept you focused on the mystery .
Not you daddy's zombie movie	If you like zombies , then you must certainly find 70 million of them to be a real delight . In fact , in the town in this film , 13 , 000 returned from the dead . But , you will be disappointed in the fact that there is no blood or gore , no eating of brains . This is just what the French do best - give us a film that makes us think for 103 minutes . Yes , they have come back , but they marched peacefully into town . They looked as if they were just buried yesterday , even though some had bee gone for 10 years . Mostly old , there were some infants and in one of the three families featured , a six-year-old . It is curious that the French do not get upset ; they proceed to develop plans to temporarily resettle the zombies while they learn their identities and check them out medically . They , of course , make plans to repatriate them to their families and jobs and make provisions for assistance - most are over 60 , as you would expect . But , the film focuses on three families : one who lost a six-year-old four years ago , one whose wife lost her husband , and one elderly couple reunited . All those questions of how you deal with loved ones returning after you have already grieved keep popping through your mind . Sometimes , in the case of the parents and child , there are different responses . The film does not explore why they came back , and why they suddenly leave again . It is more concerned with how people deal with death . It is a thoughtful film that really keeps your attention , even though some complain about its slowness . Well , of course it is slow , it is a film about zombies .
Wanted's Best Body Parts	Don't kid yourself . Nobody went to this film to see any of the actors listed before Angelina , and the studios knew it . Are there posters of trailers that feature James McAvoy ? Who is he anyway ? I saw one site that said they are thinking trilogy ; that he is the next Bourne . Give me a break ! McAvoy compared to Matt Damon . Unbelievable . What was the best feature of this movie ? Hands down , it is Angelina Jolie's lips . Director Timur Bekmambetov made sure that there were plenty of closeups of these luscious parts . Men melted in the aisles as they came to the screen Next , it was her warm green eyes . They just grab you and won't let go . Unfortunately for McAvoy , they can also trap you into doing things that are wrong . Angelina's trigger finger is not to be overlooked . She proves that she is a capable match for any bad guy and Willis or Thurman have nothing on her . McAvoy got a real closeup of Jolie's uterus when she was splayed on the hood . But only Shiloh Jolie-Pitt ? and whoever else is in there ? knows what it's really like . Lookie James , but no touchee . Everyone is focuses on Jolie's breast when their eyes stray from the lips . Not on full display in this film , but check out Taking Lives , Original Sin , and , of course , Gia for more information . It is Jolie's heart that captivates many , and she showed a little when she came to McAvoy's aid in shutting up his girlfriend . The World knows that heart well . Despite the 20 minute set up in this movie , we really can't focus on McAvoy . There is likely to be a sequel ( please , no trilogy ) and it will likely feature Jolie again . We can only hope .
It is not our abilities that show what we truly are . . . it is our choices .	I went back to look at the two Chris Columbus-directed Harry Potter movies . These were the one that were more light fantasy and enjoyable in that light . Hagrid : And I'd just like to say that , if it hadn't been for you , Harry , and Ron , and Hermione of course , I would . . . I'd still be You-Know-Where . So I'd just like to say : thanks . Harry : There's no Hogwarts without you , Hagrid . The usual cast is back , as Richard Harris is still with us . Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson still steal the show , but Kenneth Branagh as professor Lockhart gives an excellent performance . We still have John Williams great music , and great makeup , set decoration and special effects , but they don't have the impact of the first film . We do so look forward to harry growing up .
I felt my phoenix rise from the ashes .	I would suggest this film be shown in marriage counseling classes . It was a quirky little comedy that was brilliantly shot and superbly directed by Silvio Soldini , who also wrote the story . Licia Maglietta is Rosalba , a bored housewife that is neglected by her husband . When she misses a tour bus , they do not even notice for two hours . She hitches a ride home , but decided to go to Venice instead , as she has never seen it . fate intervenes and she misses her transportation home and she decides to get a job and stay . Bruno Ganz as Fernando was contemplating suicide when she walked into his life . He was only one of many that she touched . She was appreciated . She finally goes home , and everyone acts if she was never gone . When Fernando comes to take her back , you can guess what she did . Some man find this boring , but they haven't a romantic heart . It was a beautiful love story of a woman freed .
Christmas Eve . Ho ho fcking ho !	I don't miss an opportunity to see Joh Cusack . This was a good film for him . Not terribly innovative - a lawyer trying to rip off the mob on Christmas Eve . The usual double crosses and a somewhat predictable ending . It was good film noir . Billy Bob Thorton was not in the movie as much as I thought . He was Cusack's partner , but had a small role . I do not think that I wish to die as he did . Oliver Platt is another I like seeing and he was hilarious in every scene that he was in . A real riot ! Connie Nielsen ( Gladiator ) was a classic femme fatale . Richard Russo & Robert Benton wrote a good caper screenplay , even if it was not innovative . The movie moved along well and had some very good moments - like Thorton's death scene . : - ) Harold Ramis did a good job directing . He's done some interesting films like Groundhog Day and Anaylize This ; I like his work .
You must be Suzanne . You look pretty enough to eat .	One thing I always liked about Robert Ludlum thrillers is just when you think you have it figured out , it goes in a completely different direction . There are so many twists and turns in this film that I have a sore neck from watching . One thing I also like about director John Dahl ( Kill Me Again , Rounders , Unforgettable ) is that he can be depended upon to direct and , in this case , write ( with his brother Rick ) a good story . Now , add Nick Cage , Dennis Hopper , Lara Flynn Boyle , and J . T . Walsh to the cast and you have a story that will keep your interest even if they are playing characters that all of them have perfected . Dahl seems to bring out the best in folks , and this will keep you interested , and guessing , until the very end .
Hugh was brilliant	I know this wasn't a huge success . Grant committed to doing it before his huge hit Four Weddings and a Funeral , but it was fun nonetheless . The conflict between the uptight Englishmen and the Welsh villagers over whether they had a hill or a mountain was extremely funny , and their solution - getting Ian McNeice drunk and keeping Hugh Grant busy with Tara Fitzgerald , who also played Grant's wife in Sirens added to the hilarity . The randy barkeep comes up with the solution to the problem , ostensibly to sell more beer , but it gets the whole town working together and make for an enjoyable film .
I'm not who you think I am	I love Ellen Page , but I am not so sure that I love what Bruce McDonald has done with her here . It is a story about being a 15-year-old teenager named Tracey Berkowitz ( Page ) : conflicting emotions and perceptions , a volatile compound of anger , vulnerability , curiosity , recklessness and fear . It is shot in a manner that may be unviewable for some : non-linear , fragmented scenes , and some really loud music . Dysfunctional families , weird shrinks , mean-girls at school ; it is really not so much about what is happening , but about Tracey's perception of events . If you cant stand the ride , it is worth it . I mean , watching seven or eight fragments at a time is wild ! And , of course , Page is terrific .
Darling , I am more man than you will ever be , and more woman than you will ever get .	What do Kevin Spacey , Philip Seymour Hoffman , Denzel Washington , and Russell Crowe have in common . They were all up for the Best Actor Award at the 2000 Screen Actors Guild competition . Spacey won for American Beauty , but Hoffman was there for this film . You can always predict that Robert De Niro will turn in a good performance , and he certainly did as a homophobic security guard who has a stroke while trying to stop a drug shootout . He has to ask Hoffman , a transvestite lounge singer that lives in his building , for help in recovering , after his physical therapist tells him that singing improves stroke victims . This is set amidst a huge group of drag queens competing in a talent contest , and drug dealers trying to get their stolen money back . It is hilarious and sad at the same time . Every gay and drag joke you can imagine is here along with tragedy that will make you cry . What is great is the transformation made by people that just take the time to get to know one another . Hoffman was magnificent . Wilson Jermaine Heredia was a riot .
Lamarr's first American film	No , Charles Boyer never said , " Take me to the Casbah . " That is just as false as " Play it again , Sam , " a line from a film that will come to mind when watching this one . Boyer ( Conquest , Fanny , Gaslight ) picked up his second Oscar nomination for this film . He plays a jewel thief that has found a haven in the Casbah in French Algiers . He has a hot girlfriend in Sigrid Gurie , but he sees Hedy Lamarr and it is all over . he falls head over heels and spends languid afternoon reminiscing about a Paris that he can never see again . Director John Cromwell , who had his career ruined by McCarthy fascist in the 50s , did a very good job of presenting the excitement of the Casbah and the attempts by the French police to trap Boyer . He was ably assisted by the sets decorated by Alexander Toluboff ( Stagecoach , Vogues of 1938 ) and the cinematography of James Wong Howe ( The Rose Tattoo , Hud ) , who along with Toluboff received an Oscar nomination for this film , the first of ten in his career . Just like Kong , it wasn't man , but beauty killed the beast . In this case , the beauty of Hedy Lamarr proved to be the death of Boyer in an ending that will again remind one of Casablanca .
Mr Haggard , leave that Wall alone !	This was an excellent documentary by a former Catholic Priest into the actions of his Church , the evangelical movement , and politicians over the years to discriminate and kill in the name of Jesus . It starts with an overview of the indoctrination of Air Force cadets at the military academy and the resulting bigotry and discrimination against Jews and those who will not accept the views of Ted haggard ( the preacher who was caught in a sex scandal ) and other Christo-fascists . The film ends with another visit and the attempts of the Academy to cover up what is going on and dismiss the report on the takeover by the evangelicals . James Carroll spends the time in-between visiting Germany and Italy and other places he had seen in his youth as a military dependent . he reminisced on holy sites and relics . he gave a good history of the Catholic Church and it ' ; s relationship with the Nazis and how they contributed to the persecution and death of the Jews . Those wanting to see how Jews were persecuted and how our political leaders are infusing religion into politics would be well served by this film .
Zorro to the extreme	Tyrone Power in The Mark of Zorro plays a foppish character designed to throw off suspicion that he is , in fact , the legendary Zorro . George Hamilton in an Oscar-worthy performance ( if they gave an award for comedy - which they don't ! ) plays Zorro who is injured and has to rely on his twin brother to stand in . George Hamilton as Bunny Wigglesworth is a riot . He is flamboyantly gay and wears lemon , plum , and scarlet instead of Zorro Black . He also likes to use a whip , which is not entirely out of character for Zorro , as he is as adept with the tail as he is with the foil . This is an entertaining farce that Zorro fans , Hamilton fans and others will enjoy . An excellent supporting cast includes Lauren Hutton , Brenda Vaccaro , and Ron Leibman .
If he's not gonna eat her , why did he take her ?	Now I know why Tommy Lee Jones has such trouble with his wife in Blue Sky . Her prior experience with King Kong messed her up for life . This was Jessica Lange's debut and she was the best part of this movie . Sure , the sound , special effects , cinematography were all outstanding , and I even liked Jeff Bridges and Rene Auberjonois , but it was Lange that made the movie . This is the third Kong I have seen and I have never see one that virtually dripped with sexuality and passion . If this movie went before the ratings board today , it might get a " R " for the scene where she is on the deck with a cigarette . I have never seen a cigarette look so sexual . Or the scene where she is drugged and the Kong surrogate is dancing in front of her . That scene was more passionate than a Jenna Jameson flick . Or the scene where Kong appears and she sees him for the first time . It was as if she was deflowered . the scream was pure ecstasy ! The shower scene where Kong blows on her to dry her was supercharged ! Sure , this is a Kong film , but with Lange it became a porno film . If this film doesn't excite you , you are dead !
Only people who remember this is us	The one thing that strikes you more than anything else about the war documentary is how quiet it is . You would expect bombs exploding and bullets whizzing and shouts and screams , but they are all missing from this work by Petra Epperlein and Michael Tucker . What remains is a constant recognition of the tension under which these soldiers are operating . Every moment , 24 hours a day , they are under threat . Everey step they take , every road they travel is fraught with danger from IEDs or motors or rifle fire . They are America's young ; people who , for the most part , had no other options back home , and are now joined in a brotherhood that plays together , prays together , and dies together . It is a beautiful story of what our soldiers are going through .
Finish it . Get back your life .	An interesting twist to the typical revenge movie . Ron Eldard's life is turned upside down after his son is killed and his wife ( Marisa Coughlan ) is attacked during a burglary . This information is presented in brief flashbacks as he proceeds to a room where the supposed burglar is strapped to a chair and a table full of implements a la Hostel is available to him to exact his revenge . Christopher Plummer plays a psychiatrist that arranges for former law enforcement officers to find the perpetrator when the police fail . But , things don't go as planned and Eldard ends up running for his life . An exciting thriller with lots of action in the second half , and an unexpected ending .
Jerry , I want you to know . You're the craziest fck I ever met .	Gay hit man Leroy ( James Gandolfini ) holds Jerry's ( Bradd Pit ) girlfriend ( Julia Roberts ) hostage until he gets a gun ( The Mexican ) . Sounds simple , but there is a whole lot of comedy and talk about relationships in that plot . I don't know why people diss Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts for their acting ability . They both do a credible job and this is one of the best jobs that Julia Roberts has done . I just like Brad Pitt , and not because he has Angelina , which is a good reason to think he has his sht together , don't you think ? He is not a brilliant actor , but he does a good job and does a fine job her . Gandofini is brilliant as the gay hit man . GLAAD agrees and gave him an award for this performance . It was well deserved . Check it out .
If you're important , people will wait .	Cool ? Maybe tepid is the right word . The premise ? that Chili ( John Travolta ) decides to help singer Linda Moon ( Christina Milian - YUM ! ) escape from crooked manager Raji ( Vince Vaughn ) ? is solid , but the story just seems to float all over the place . It was almost as if they were trying to do an Ocean's movie with all the characters : Harvey Keitel as a promoter ; The Rock as gay failed actor ( He does end up in a film with Nicole Kidman ) ; Robert Pastorelli as a hired killer ; Cedric The Entertainer as a gangsta rap leader ; and Uma Thurman ( Double YUM ! as a sexy record-label owner ? the story quality plummets . A better director would have controlled this mob instead of letting them go off track . Unfortunately , or fortunately you may say , I do not think we will see another Elmore Leonard book turned into a movie with Travolta and Thurman . Too bad .
Tastes like Crash	It may be presumptuous to say that this is similar to the great film Crash , but it deals with the same themes of prejudice and intolerance . Stuart Gordon ( Re-Animator , Body Snatchers ) takes a David Maumet ( Ronin , Wag the Dog ) play and has a stellar cast led by William H . Macy , to give us a look at a man who loses control in a world that he is not familiar with . The consequences are disastrous , but funny , especially the end of the film . It also stars Denise Richards , Bai Ling ( Star Wars : Episode III - Revenge of the Sith ) , Debi Mazar ( Ugly Betty ) , and Mena Suvari . It is Bokeem Woodbine's role as Macy's cell mate that has a role you will not forget .
You cannot live in isolation from the human race , you know .	This Gothic film is supposedly become a cult favorite . So much so that Criterion has release a two-disk edition of the work . I certainly do not recommend rushing out to purchase it . It is really not that good , and I don't know what prompted its status . It has an eerie feel throughout , but that is because of the persistent organ music . There really isn't much of a story . A girl ( Candace Hilligoss ) survives an accident and is haunted by visions . The thing that gives a key to a possible mystery is the fact that she is persistent in not wanting human contact . Which is really frustrating to her fellow boarder ( Sidney Berger ) , who tries everything to get in her pants . She displays many of the symptoms of a Schizoid Personality Disorder , but we really don't know where that comes from . Is she crazy ? Is she a zombie ? Are these visions in her imagination , or are they real ?
You choose your quality of life ; why not your quality of death ?	So , you are healthy ( for the most part ) and not a burden to anyone , why should you not choose when you can depart this world . Who better that you to say when enough is enough . That's the tough question to answer , but it is put forth in this film as it focuses on Mademoiselle Lisette Nigot . Of course , the easier question is why can't those with a terminal disease and in constant pain be allowed to go ? That example is also given and it is harder for a rational human being to deny this individual relief from pain . The right to die is surely as important as the right to live , or maybe it isn't . You owe it to yourself and society to be informed on the question , and this film does an excellent job of doing just that .
Shame on US	Despite the fact that this film had three Oscar nominations , and several Golden Globe nominations with one win ( Katharine Ross ) , and a boatload of stars , it is not worth watching so much for it's quality ( marginal ) but for the story of how we knew what was happening to the Jews before World War II and did little to stop it . This is the story of 937 Jews that were put on a boat to Havana with useless documents , as the German government had no intention of letting them off the ship . They were denied entry into Cuba , and the US also denied them entry before they finally were saved by a social service agency and allowed to land in Belgium . Of course , that would prove ultimately fatal for two-thirds of them as the war started just two months later . Why would Germany do this ? Simple . By sending a ship of Jews to the America's and having them turned away , they negated any right the US would have to complain when they started exterminating Jews . Clever of them , and our government fell right into their trap . Our support for Israel is not so much that we love the Jews , but a massive guilt for our participation in their extermination . There were some great performances in this otherwise mediocre film : Lee Grant and Katherine Ross ; some good performances : Ben Gazzara , Faye Dunaway ; and the film debut of Jonathan Pryce ( POTC 1 . 2 . & 3 , Tomorrow Never Dies ) . Check it out .
Three little words	The " C " Word : Jojo ( Lili Taylor ) is set to marry a fisherman , only she collapses during the ceremony . She's terrified of commitment . She prefers sex to marriage . The " L " Word : Daisy ( Julia Roberts ) is viewed by everyone as a happy hedonist , begins an affair with a preppie from out of town . Afraid of love , she tries to sabotage their affair . The " S " Word : Daisy's sister Kat ( Annabeth Gish ) is a diligent and smart girl who is headed to Yale to study astronomy . Although her interests are the starry skies , she yearns to unlock the secrets of ex . That's why she allows herself to be seduced by a married architect whose wife is overseas . Director Donald Petrie in his first feature film draws out impressive performances from these three young starlets as they try to unlock the mysteries of commitment , love and sex . And , this was Matt Damon's film debut !
Fill your hands , you son of a bitch .	John Wayne won his Oscar for playing a drunken Marshall in this film with Kim Darby and Glen Campbell . What really characterizes the movie for me is the dialog . Kim Darby , who went on to play some 60 more roles , none of which I have seen , was considered a promising newcomer for this film . Marguerite Roberts , in one of her last writing assignments , really wrote some excellent words for Darby . It made the movie really enjoyable and immensely funny . Another newcomer in the film , Delight , Arkansas ' own ( Rhinestone Cowboy , Wichita Lineman ) Glen Campbell also put in a good performance as a Texas ranger helping Wayne catch a double murderer - triple , if you count the dog . True Grit also starred Robert Duvall , Dennis Hopper , and one of the most fascinating men in Hollywood , Jeff Corey .
Why did you kill my mother ?	This Oscar-nominated film ( Best Picture ) shows the dark side of journalism as a paper delves into the past of a woman ( Frances Starr ) who was impregnated by her boss and acquitted of his murder . Edward G . Robinson ( Little Caesar ) is a newspaper editor that is interested in boosting circulation and is not concerned with the lives he destroys in the process . He goes after Nancy Voorhees ( Starr ) , who is now Nancy ( Voorhees ) Townsend and is not concerned that she has not told her daughter ( the doll-faced Marian Marsh ) , who is now about to me married , about her past . Robinson was absolutely brilliant in the role and ably assisted by Boris Karloff and Oscar-nominated actress ( Dragon Seed ) Aline MacMahon in her first film . A classic showing the seedy side of journalism .
I saw a statue once . It was called , " the third time Phyllis saw me , she exploded . "	This film was produced and directed by Roger Corman , the King of the B's . Corman directed a little over 50 films , but he produced seven times that many . He launched the careers of martin Scorsese , Francie Ford Coppola and Peter Bogdonovich , to name a few . he is a wizard of the low-budget film . While this is a perfect example of that , it is still a fascinating work . It takes place in the land of beatniks . pretentious SOBs that think they are " hip . " Walter ( Dick Miller ) was just a low functioning busboy . he wanted to be appreciated , but those around him were too busy loving themselves . He stumbles upon a " talent " while he was trying to create and becomes a star . One cannot talk about his talent without giving away secrets , but suffice it to say , it makes for interesting theater . An excellent example of Corman's work .
The angel of justice prevails .	An absolutely outstanding bit of film noir and a showcase for some very fine actors of the period . Victor Trivas ' story received an Oscar nomination , but Orson Welles was magnificent in direction and acting in this film about Nazi's hiding in America . He almost got away with his ruse , but he got to ranting so much that he slipped and a Government investigator ( Edward G . Robinson ) caught it . The rest of the film was a cat and mouse adventure as Robinson tried to convince Welles ' new wife ( Loretta Young ) that she married a war criminal , and enlist her help in his capture . Excitement throughout featuring murder and attempted murder , ending with with a twist that could only occur as a result of the Nazi's efforts .
The streets are alive with the sound of pain .	Sure it's familiar , but that doesn't mean it isn't great . Guy Richie has a formula for entertaining gangster flicks , and this one is full of fun . You really need a scorecard to keep track of who's screwing whom , but it is fun watching all the crooks just do it to each other . You are left wondering who will be on top at the end . Gerard Butler , Idris Elba , Tom Hardy , Tom Wilkinson , and Karel Roden all make this an interesting film , and you add the luscious Thandie Newton in the mix , oh boy ! Laughs , witty lines , and action throughout ; this is one great film . Can't wait for the next one , Guy .
Hardened criminals on parade	Mr . Pink : You kill anybody ? Mr . White : A few cops . Mr . Pink : No real people ? Mr . White : Just cops . This is probably the most succinct characterization of this movie . We are talking hardened criminals here that have no regard for cops . Killing them is a sport . This movie shows the criminal mind better than any other I have seen . It is raw and hard and bloody and violent . It is not full of shootout and special effects . It is pure and clean and focused on conversation that gives some insight into what a criminal goes through . The anxiety after a botched job becomes paranoia and suspicion . Yes , it is justified , but here you see it to the extreme . Harvey Keitel , Michael Madsen , and Steve Buscemi were a joy to watch even though I would have shot Mr . Pink at the first opportunity just to shut him up !
My insurance does not cover PMS !	This is supposedly based upon some play by Shakespeare . Who cares ? he is so last millennium . This is a fantastic and funny movie that was brilliantly written by Karen McCullah Lutz & Kirsten Smith . You can be sure that I will look for more of their work . I never came across Julia Stiles until the Bourne trilogy , and then I caught her in a quirky little film called The Business of Strangers . This performance here makes me want to see everything she has done . She was just fantastic and I am totally in love with her ! Heath ledger was also perfect in this film . You can see why he became the star that he was until this week . I understand this film made him and you can certainly see why . If you want funny and romantic and cute , there isn't a better film .
The way a thriller should be made	You watch the Bruce Willis version of the Jackal and you think that is so cool , but you don't know cool until you see Edward Fox do it . Fox is the epitome of cool . The guy even wears an ascot , for god's sake ! Most people today don't even know what an ascot is . He carefully plots his moves and is methodical in his precision . He kills with cool detachment . If he had Willis ' assignment , he would have gotten it done . But , he had to deal with the European versions of the CIA / FBI and they were not restrained in how they handled investigations . With just a thread , the French police inspector carefully puts together a case with as much precision as his prey . It was a game of cat and mouse that kept you on the edge of your seat for two and a half hours without noticing the time . That is because of director Fred Zinnemann and the fact that he kept things moving along beautifully . If you want to see how a thriller is done with craft and cunning and without special effects , then this is the film for you .
Dare we dream of a golden day when the bestial War shall rule no more .	It was an epic when it was made , and still a work of art in cinema history . The first part show the " gentile " South and the war . It was romanticized to the extent that brother was fighting brother , friend was fighting friend , and in meeting during the war , they remained friends . Nice , but probably not accurate . Still , it made for a good story . The second half is filled with controversy as the Carpetbaggers invade the South and establish Black rule that is designed to crush the Whites until the Golden Knights of the Ku Klux Klan save society to live in peace . This is the story as presented , not an interpretation . Despite the historical inaccuracy , it it still a magnificent work with amazing performances by Lillian Gish , Mae Marsh , Henry B . Walthall , George Siegmann , and others . It is hard to believe that words are not needed to display feelings .
They met as enemies , but parted as friends	It may seem like another version of Joyeux Noël , but this actually came three years before . Both are based upon true stories , proving that everyone in the world is not evil , and that we can get along if we try . American and German soldiers together in Linda Hamilton's ( A Mother's Prayer , " Beauty and the Beast " ) cabin . Seeing " Sarah Connor " in a dramatic role like this was a testament to her ability . Rodney Gibbons directed a film that was tense and sweet . A true Christmas miracle . Hamilton was supported by Romano Orzari ( Burnt Eden ) , Alain Goulem , Martin Neufeld , and Mark Antony Krupa in this touching film of a mother trying to protect her son .
Heed the warning	The best thing about this film was the fact that it did not focus on the Earth's destruction , but on man's eventual demise as a species . The earth with survive our rape and plunder . It has been here for 4 . 5 billion years , while we have been here but 150 , 000 . We will eventually join the 99 . 999 % of the species that have lived on this planet and who are now extinct . How quickly we join them is up to us , but we will eventually go the way of the dinosaur . Through our heavy consumption and trash creation , we are rapidly stripping all of the resources from the Earth and polluting what we don't consume . Soon , we will be faced with the inevitable - it's all gone . If you haven't seen " A Crude Awakening : The Oil Crash , " then it should be on your list as a " must see . " Along with " An Inconvenient Truth , " this film tells us what will happen if we stay the course . The only fault I found in the film was the rapidity with which it presented information . This stuff needs to be digested slowly , and we got it rapid fire . Still , it is an important addition to the story of humankind and how we are planning our own destruction .
My job requires a certain . . . moral flexibility .	Jason Reitman has a long and brilliant career ahead as a director and writer if he keeps putting out films like this . Aaron Eckhart ( In the Company of Men ) was simply brilliant as a lobbyist that tries to balance his client's interests with the need for his son to understand him . The son was played by Cameron Bright ( Birth , Running Scared ) , who is definitely an up and coming star . Although she has a small part , the chance to see Maria Bello is never to be missed . With William H . Macy , Robert Duvall , J . K . Simmons , Sam Eliiott and Rob Lowe , there is something for everyone here . It is hard not to like Nick Naylor ( Eckhart ) , who comes up smelling like a rose despite major difficulties . This guy could even make Bush look good !
Yes , I am . But I'm your dirty old pervert .	I really liked " Before Sunrise , " and this film is similar , but with an interesting twist that I cannot reveal or it will spoil it for you . Hans Canosa took Gabrielle Zevin's excellent screenplay and made a picture that seemed weird at first , but ultimately becomes interesting . I am . , of course , referring to the fact that there are two cameras on screen constantly . At the wedding , you see one camera on the wedding , while the other is on the conversation between Aaron Eckhart and Helena Bonham Carter , in what I consider her best role to date . The split screen is used later to great effect to show two different stories . Yeah , it's different , but it doesn't spoil the outstanding conversation the two are having . It is a super romantic movie that I want to watch again .
Baptism ! You two're just dumber'n a bag of hammers .	This Oscar-nominated film is my favorite Coen-Brother's film after Fargo . George Clooney is just hilarious as the leader of misfit escapees . I had to put off cutting my grass just to see it again . Yes , I am still cutting grass the last week of November . The cinematography and music in this film is a delight in itself , but the characters are just a thrill to watch . John Goodman . a Coen Brother's favorite , Holly Hunter as the wife , Charles Durning as the Governor and his crazy crew , and , of course , Mia Tyler , Musetta Vander , and Christy Taylor as the Sirens . Baby Face Nelson , the KKK , and Mississippi politics all rolled into a fun movie .
Real men don't cry ; their tears are brought by the wind .	Chechnya's struggle for independence has been going on since 1994 . It probably escaped the attention of most people until the rebels struck inside Russia in Beslan , where 300 people , mainly children , were murdered on the first day of school . The 2006 film , Beslan : Three Days in September , shows that tragedy . The thing that grabs you about this film is the fact that is seems so much a home movie . One of the three individuals , Ramzan , has a video camera that is with him always . He uses it to film Ruslan's family when he is not working . It is something that we can all relate to . But , under the surface is an ominous portent . It seems that most of the time they are talking about people in the past . And they are . Watching Ramzan film from his Aunt's apartment during the invasion , there are moments of levity when they are three hours from New Year's Day ( 1995 ) , and they are talking of the fireworks outside . But , such levity is rare as a depression creeps in over the people when they realize that war will not end . Most Americans have no concept of war . This film brings it home and shows what a terrible tragedy the world faces .
It was a time when we made bold moves .	I was just a lad of 19 when we accomplished one of the greatest feats of all time - putting a man on another body in space . This is the story of that magnificent accomplishment and the eight subsequent trips to the moon told by those who made the trips . These men are the only ones who have been to the moon , as we have made no trips back since the Apollo program . I loved Tom Wolf's story , The Right Stuff about these astronauts , but to see them tell their own story was awesome . These are the guys who really ventured where no man has gone before . What was amazing to them and to me is the fact that the whole world was part of our ventures and we were , for a brief time , one world united . We sure blew that .
A house without love is a living death .	One can watch this film and learn a lot . The philosophy woven throughout , mainly by the Priest Takuan ( Kuroemon Onoe ) , about what it means to be a man and honor your family ( community ) is the hidden jewel of this film . Takezo ( Toshirô Mifune ) represents all the rebellious youth that only think of themselves . He cares nothing for the damage he does . To the entire village , he is a dangerous animal . But , the Priest finds that he is worthy of rehabilitation and proceeds to make him into a Samurai warrior in service to the castle . This is a slow and thoughtful film , full of swordplay for those looking for that , but it is so much more for those who take the time to discover it . Kaoru Yachigusa plays Otsu , who is abandoned by her fiancé ( Rentaro Mikuni ) and falls in love with Takezo . Unfortunately , his training , after she waits for him for three years , has only begun as he begins a journey across Japan to get in touch with the people . I can't wait to see the next installment of this trilogy , which is cinematically brilliant , as one would expect from a Criterion disk , and features outstanding acting from all concerned .
False advertising	I looked this up on Comcast and the title suggested it might be interesting with a title that smacks of sexual symbolism . The description talked about cattle barons and a hard time , so I thought it might be another Brokeback Mountain . Well , it wasn't that at all It was about evil and out of control cowpokes . Joel McCrea ( the ramrod ) 1s the honest cowpoke who comes out of his drunken stupor after losing his family to find his own way . But his costar , Veronica Lake as Connie Dickason , steals the film as a strong-willed butch-type , who goes against the wishes of her rancher father Ben Dickason ( Charles Ruggles ) and refuses to marry his choice - - the evil Frank Ivey ( Preston Foster ) and goes for a sheep man . GASP ! Evidently , she wants someone she can whip . Well , somehow sheep boy skedaddles out of town and leaves his sheep ranch to his fiancée , who proceeds to fight daddy and Ivey . This is NOT a misogynist Bond movie ! It is a western done by a Hungarian director , which had an interesting script with a lot more than you usually see in a cowboy movie .
De Palma is a master craftsman	I'm sorry . . . You look so familiar . Haven't we met before , somewhere ? That sounds like a tired pickup line , but it is significant to this movie in a way that cannot be explained without giving away the plot . I watched this to see Rie Rasmussen's ( Angel-A ) debut film . She had a small role , but oh , so , delicious to watch ! This was Rebecca Romijn's and Antonio Banderas ' film , and they did a great job of keeping me interested throughout . But , it is really Brian De Palma's film . A neo-noir masterpiece that was so deep on so many levels that it could be a whole semester in film school . It all seemed so simple , but that is the deception that De Palma uses to drag you in before he blows you away . It is an homage to so many great films and great directors , notably Hitchcock . If you love film , it is one you should not miss . If nothing else , there is Rie Rasmussen to keep you interested .
Not your daddy's nunsploitation	There is so much that can be said about this film . It is not your typical nunsploitation . Of course , there is nudity and sex with nuns , but that is almost incidental to the story . It is set in 15th Century Italy , at the time of the martyrdom of 800 Christians at Otranto . The battle between the Muslims and the Christians takes up a good part of the film . It was interesting when everyone was running from the Muslim hoards , that the mother superior would ask , " Why do you fear the Muslims , ; they will not do anything that the Christians have done to you ? " Certainly , there was enough torture on both sides . Sister Flavia ( Florinda Bolkan ) is sent to a convent for defying her father . In the process , she witnesses and endures many things : the gelding of a stallion , the rape of a local woman by a new Duke , the torture of a nun who was overcome during a visit by the Tarantula Sect , and a whipping herself when she ran off with a Jew . The torture was particularly gruesome with hot wax being poured on the nun , and her nipples cut off . Sister Flavia is bound to continue to get into trouble as she questions the male-dominated society in which she lives . She even asks Jesus , why the father , son and holy ghost are all men . Eventually , she joins the leader of the Muslims as his lover and they sack the convent . Here is where you see more flesh than you can possible enjoy at one time . But , tragedy is to come . She manages to exact sweet revenge on all , including the Duke and her father , but finds that the Muslim lover treats her exactly the same . She is a woman and that is all there is to it . I won't describe what the holy men of the church did to this heretic at the end , but it predates the torture of Saw or Hostel by decades . Nunsploitation fans will be satisfied with the treats , but movie lovers will find plenty of meat to digest .
Where is Howard ? Who is Howard ?	On thing you can be certain of when you watch a Wim Wenders ( Buena Vista Social Club , Paris , Texas , The End of Violence ) is stunning cinematography , a great soundtrack , and an emotional story . Franz Lustig's cinematography in Montana , Utah and Nevada was breathtaking . The shot inside the casino was surreal . I could watch the film with the sound off just to see the pictures . The soundtrack by Bono and T-Bone Burnett was thrilling . Wenders always has great music in his films . Then there is the story . I know exactly what Sam Shepard was feeling . Jessica Lange was super , as she always is . Sarah Polley was a thrill and really made the story . Fairuza Balk was an interesting character that I want to see again . I just like Wim Wenders and he did a great job with this Sam Shepard story .
Don't do it , Daddy ! You'll hit me once too often , and then they'll hang yer .	Cheng Huan ( Richard Barthelmess , who became a star with this film and would go on to earn two Oscar nominations ) comes to London to make his fortune , but soon finds himself in the drudgery of everyday life . Lucy ( Oscar nominee Lillian Gish ) is a 15-year-old girl who is used as a punching bag by her father , a boxer , Battling Burrows ( Oscar winner Donald Crisp ) . East meets West and flowers bloom . Lucy smiles for the first time in her life , and is treated like a Princess . But things don't last , as they are found out by Battling Burrows . Hatred in his heart , Burrows strikes out with disastrous consequence . D . W . Griffith manages to bring out the best in Gish and Crisp and in a beautifully tinted film gives us a tragic love story .
Happy birthday to the head rabbit	Who would have guessed that 81-year-old Hugh Hefner actually acted in a movie that didn't have Playboy in the title ? I think it is also appropriate that Hef has a birthday right after Easter . But he was in this Mel Brooks classic . If you like Young Frankenstein or the The Producers , then you will absolutely love this movie . It is a rollicking roller coaster ride of sight gags , double entendres , laughs and zany fun that characterizes Mel Brooks . It includes the usual cast of characters in addition to Hef : Harvey Korman , Rudy De Luca , Madeline Kahn , and Dom DeLuise , and , of course , Brooks . It is a spoof of the French Revolution , the Inquisition , the Last Supper , the Roman Empire and more .
It's not easy being you , is it ?	I really loved Mike Leigh's Secrets and Lies , so I expected this Oscar and Golden Globe nominated film would be equally good . I was not disappointed . Sally Hawkins got a Golden Globe for her performance along with a shelf full of other awards . She played a girl ( Poppy ) so happy she even smiled at her bike being stolen . Well , her positive manner certainly comes in handy as a primary schoolteacher . Her classes are fun ! She decided not to replace her bike , but to learn to drive . Eddie Marsan was a riot as the driving instructor . He had his work cut out for him . His mood worse and worse as the weeks went on . He certainly had problems relating to others . Karina Fernandez as the flamenco teacher also had her work cut out for her . She was so passionate and hilarious . Poppy tried to stay happy , but she was constantly coming up against negative forces . Still , she carried on . She may seem overly flighty at times , but there is a deepness there as shows with the little boy , with the homeless man , and with her efforts to change Scott ( Marsan ) Leigh hits another home run , and Hawkins is a thrill .
Work is for people who can't play video games .	This was a fascinating incursion into the world of gamers . There were all kinds of interesting characters ; some just plain bizarre . What was most interesting as how people lined up to support their champion and discount any attempt to dethrone him . Any attempt was questioned , and modified as " getting a lucky break , " rather than focusing on the skill of the player . I still can't get over the dude who was running around yelling about the Kill Screen coming up . That was hilarious ! It was with great satisfaction that this David ( Steve Wiebe ) took on the establishment and beat the Goliath ( Billy Mitchell ) . Congrats !
You need me to be sick .	I know that I have commented on Johnny Depp's versatility from Pirates to Sweeney Todd to Before Night falls , but I had my breath taken away from his role in this film . He was a sort of free spirit that came into the life of schizophrenic Joon ( Mary Stuart Masterson ) , and transformed her with love . Until he arrived , her brother Benny ( Aidan Quinn ) ran her life for her . It is not meant to be completely critical , as there are many who run the lives of the mentally ill and developmentally disabled out of love and a misunderstanding that everyone is capable to run their own lives to some degree . After all , he gave up his own chance at freedom and love to care for his sister . But , Sam ( Depp ) showed him that he can grow and let loose and allow Joon to live her own life . It was a funny , tender , and very sweet film , with Depp just blowing me away . It also featured many other great stars as support .
Poor people can't survive , so they have to kill their babies .	It is hard to believe that this film was made in 1974 as it mirrors the circumstances of the US in the last 16 years . The abortion rate under Clinton's Presidency was lower than under the Bush administration . Why the difference ? Read the quote above . If the poor can't buy rice , they don't have more children . This all comes out as Hanzo ( Shintarô Katsu ) is investigating the death of a woman after an abortion . This investigation leads him Monk-style to a Temple where young girls are sold to wealthy businessmen for torture and rape , with an abortion business on the side . He captures the Priestess and tortures her before using the Hanzo technique to get her to talk . His investigation is delayed while he is assigned to find Japan's greatest thief , who rapes and murders his victims . The thief is heading toward Hanzo's village . he hides in the mint to snare him . While there he manages to gather further evidence against the person benefiting from the Temple . A big showdown with many dead at the hands of his sword , and both thieves are captured in fine Hanzo fashion . Can't wait for the next adventure .
Amorality , greed , cynicism , and narcissism .	This is the best of the 43 films that Rainer Werner Fassbinder made ; his most successful at least . He was one of the leading directors in the New Germany after WWII . Hanna Schygulla was magnificent as the cold , calculating Maria Bruan , who lost her husband to the War , found him after she took an American soldier as a lover , lost him again after he went to jail for her , and found him agin at the end . Her day and a half marriage before he disappeared was longer than their time together at the end . Such is life . Things come and go , and you do the best you can . You can give up or adjust you way of thinking to survive . Even though Maria adjusted her thinking and did what she had to do , she never stopped loving Hermann , which makes the end such a tragedy . Excellent drama .
A rollicking great action yarn ( that was true ! )	The first thing you notice about this film is the racist MPAA . Despite it being rated PG for war violence , there was nudity . Breasts were exposed , but they weren't those of Barbara Parkins ( " Peyton Place " , Valley of the Dolls , and her skintastic moment in Breakfast in Paris ) , but of African natives . Seems that black breasts are not taboo for children to see . But , to the film itself . It is actually two films . The first half in 1912 , has Lee Marvin ( Cat Ballou , Paint Your Wagon ) as a drunken ivory poacher who manages to get Roger Moore ( The Spy Who Loved Me , " The Saint " ) to partner up with him . After Moore and Parkins ( Marvin's daughter ) plan to marry , there is a great fight scene reminiscent of many John Wayne pictures . Then the film changes . World War I is declared and the Germans are on the march led by Reinhard Kolldehoff ( Moon Over Parador , " The Winds of War " ) , a big fat German pig whose men slaughter Moore and Parkins baby , and set them on a search for revenge . The film has plenty of action , including what I would call a paper mache bi-plane which almost takes Moore's life , and culminates in the blowing up of a German battleship that had run over Moore and Marvin earlier . Marvin was extremely funny and Moore looked just great painted black to get on the ship . Parkins was radiant throughout , even when consumed with revenge for the murder of her baby . Sir Ian Holm ( Chariots of Fire ) was also fantastic as Marvin's mute servant .
The Japanese David Lynch	The fact that your film is a winner at Venice is evidence enough of your artistry . Shinya Tsukamoto ( Ichi the Killer ) wrote , directed and starred in this weird film that certainly establishes him as and eccentric and extreme cinema pioneer . Saved by Rinko ( Asuka Kurosawa ) , Iguchi ( Tsukamoto ) seeks to return the favor and help her escape her boring , sexless life as a wife of a successful Japanese businessman ( Yuji Kohtari ) , who is all work and no play . He blackmails her into walking around the streets in a very short mini with no underwear , ala Britney Spears and Paris Hilton . He also has her buy a vibrator and some long veggies to use in masturbatory experiences . But it is not all kinky sex , as there is some torture that would make the movie inappropriate for CIA personnel . They don't need any new ideas to replace water-boarding . All of this is done in a sometimes surreal manner with a blue and white color scheme and constant rainfall that makes for an interesting mood . Tsukamoto has never disappointed me , but you certainly have to look at his films with a different eye .
You Never Know Department	I picked up the wife from work last night and sat back to check out Face . Tsotsi was making it's premiere at 10 pm , so I could change if it proved boring . The description was the 2004 Korean horror film , but the movie that came on was the 2002 Chinese Face , starring Ling Bai . Needless to say , I never switched as the story of three generations of Chinese women in Queens was well worth the lost sleep . I'll just have to see Tsotsi later . Definitely recommend this one . I noticed that it was beaten at Sundance by Personal Velocity : Three Portraits , starring the incomparable Kyra Sedgwick . I cannot get enough of her in The Closer , and she was brilliant in The Woodsman .
A thrilling road trip through France	2004 was a good year for foreign films with Feux rouges and Mar adentro and Pedro Almodóvar's La Mala educación . Feux rouges is a great thriller in the style of Hitchcock . Antoine ( Jean-Pierre Darroussin ) and Hélène ( Carole Bouquet ) play husband an wife who bicker with each other on a road trip to pick up their children from Summer camp . I bet that many , if not most , husbands may see a lot of themselves in Antoine ; and many wives will see themselves in Hélène . It makes you really think about marriage . They split up , with one taking the train , and both come in contact with an escaped convict ( Vincent Deniard , in his first film ) . What happens is the second best part of this film and what makes it a Hitchcock thriller . Not to be missed .
Blessed are the forgetful , for they get the better even of their blunders .	I avoided this movie because I thought I would never see anything starring Jim Carrey ( Dumb & Dumber , The Cable Guy , Ace Ventura : When Nature Calls ) that was worth watching . That was my loss . Kate Winslet ( Little Children ) was absolutely brilliant in this film by Oscar-winner Charlie Kaufman . And , of course , one of my very favorites , Kirsten Dunst , also gave a great performance . I have to admit that I have a new appreciation for Carrey after seeing this film . He was perfect for the role and pulled it off spotlessly . No matter how bad it is , there is always something special about that relationship . So , just remember the good times .
I'm sorry I didn't see this on the big screen	I cannot believe that I missed this movie on the big screen . I finally got to see it and I was wowed by the sound , the special effects , and the art of this film . It would have been something to see at the theater . Peter Jacson's direction was incredible , and I cannot say enough about the acting of Naomi Watts . She really made this film and her character was so believable . The fight with the T-Rex's was beyond description . I also enjoyed the skating in the park . It was so tender and really put the relationship between beauty and the beast in context . This movie was outstanding , and I plan to get the DVD to watch it over and over .
The Big Lie	Jeffrey Wigand ( Russel Crowe ) put it all on the line : his family , he reputation , his career , and his life . He had a story to tell about the addictive properties of tobacco and it was eating at him until he got it out . Lowell Bergman ( Al Pacino ) of CBS News went to bat and did everything in his power to get his story out . He ended up walking away from his job also in the effort . The story made it out and Big Tobacco paid billions in the familiar tobacco settlements . This is the story of the man who brought them down . The acting was brilliant and the directing was masterful . Crowe , director Michael Mann and The Insider were all beat out in the 2000 Academy Awards by American Beauty . What a shame as this was clearly the superior film .
You want that gun , pick it up . I wish you would .	If you are looking for top action , you can't go wrong here . Howard Hawks directs John Wayne and Dean Martin in one of the most enjoyably westerns ever made . Quenton Tarantino reported has said , " When I am getting serious about a girls , I show her Rio Bravo . And she better fcking like it . " Wayne projected a balance of swagger and shrewdness , compassion and professionalism as he portrayed a " Real American , " some say as a sop to Congress and The House Un-American Activities Committee . As support for the he-man Wayne , Hawks used Dean Martin , Walter Brennan , and Angie Dickinson . He also cast pre-Roscoe P . Coltane Claude Akins as the villain . He also threw Ozzie and Harriett's son Ricky , into the mix presumably to generate teen interest . Looking for real manly-man cowboys , you'll find it here .
I am just sick !	I have good health insurance and do not worry that I will be treated for any illness that I have . Why is that not the same for every American ? The fact that we treat the prisoners in Gitmo better than we treat the heroes of says it all . We should be ashamed . The tour of the Canadian , British , French , and Cuban system is shocking to those who think that we have it better . The statistics on infant mortality and longevity show that we do not have the best system of health care in the world - far from it . " If we can find money to kill people , you can find money to help people . " It is not a matter of not having the money , it is that the rich want to have it all . Keeping people in debt and afraid of losing what little care they have makes it easier for American businesses . " An educated , healthy and confident nation is harder to govern . " We do not have a democracy , because a democracy would not put up with this system . " They think of ' we first , ' not ' me first ' . " This is what it is all about . The countries mentioned believe that they have an obligation to care for their fellow citizens . Isn't that funny ? The most so-called Christian nation in the world doesn't even follow a basic commandment given to us by Christ himself - when I was hungry , you gave me to eat ; when I was naked , you clothed me : . . . When I was sick , you gave me the care that I needed .
Your Commie has no regard for human life . Not even his own .	I am amazed that I had not seen this Stanley Kubrick classic before yesterday . I may not have appreciated it before , but it certainly is one of the best comedies ever produced . Even the title ranks among the funniest ever written . Beside the outstanding film Stanley Kubrick ( 2001 : A Space Odyssey , A Clockwork Orange , Full Metal Jacket ) has written and directed , there are stars that shine brightly throughout . Peter Sellers ( Being There , The Pink Panther ) was nominated for another Oscar for playing three roles in this film . He was just outstanding . George C . Scott ( Patton ) was over the top as Gen . ' Buck ' Turgidson . Sterling Hayden , Keenan Wynn , and Slim Pickens all turned in outstanding performances . Who will forget that final ride that Pickens made . Yee Haw ! This is the definitive film showing just how ridiculous the cold warriors were . A must see .
My all-time favorite	There is no movie that I enjoy watching over and over . This is absolutely the best film of Hugh Grant's career . Andie MacDowell is stupendous as his American Love interest . These two belong together like butter and jam on toast . There were so many great performances in this film that it is hard to point out anyone without offending another or going on all day . Rowan Atkinson was simply marvelous as a priest . Auden's poem . read at the funeral , had me in tears . This film was such a celebration of life that even death was remembered fondly . I just cannot imagine that anyone would not find this film as funny as I did .
