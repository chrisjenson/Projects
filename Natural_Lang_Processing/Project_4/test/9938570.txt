Ghoulies	Bottom-of-the-barrel film-making has Jonathan ( Peter Liapis ) , the son of a powerful Satan worshiper , possessed by his dead father's spirit after he inherits the man's estate . Everyone , from his girlfriend Rebecca ( Lisa Pelikan ) to his other seven friends . . all will fall prey to the ghoulies , a nasty group of puppet monsters . Jonathan , and his green eyes , will seemingly bring his father's life back through the conjuring of spells and supposed sacrifices , but really figuring out what the hell is going on is anyone's guess since it's obvious the ones behind the making of this so-called film seemed to have no idea . The story itself is stupid , rife with obnoxious , idiotic characters like Jonathan who act incredibly moronic . Jack Nance , oh boy , gets handed one rotten role as the man who somehow rescues Jonathan ( he and the infant's mother who takes his place ) from being sacrificed to Satan by Malcolm , the father . There are two other demonic servants for which Jonathan conjures up that do his bidding as well . The film is loaded with silly death sequences and it's blatantly obvious that the ghoulies are puppets guided around by puppeteers so the film has no scares whatsoever . This film will only apply to those who adore the worst kind of bad cinema . Horrible , horrible horror film . May be of interest to those who watch the long-running detective series LAW & ORDER : SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT since one of this film's victims is Mariska Hargitay . . heck , everyone has to start somewhere even if it's in this hunk of garbage .
Welcome to the Jungle	Vacationing American tourists decide to leave the beautiful , lush locale of Fiji to find some Vice President's son , lost in the jungles of New Guinea where cannibals await them , hoping to make thousands of dollars if they can snag an interview with the man . . if he's still alive that is . With two camcorders , the two couples record their activities leading up to , during , and the aftermath of their expedition . We watch as the relationships between the two couples disintegrate and what occurs when they do indeed encounter the natives . Mandi ( Sandy Gardiner ) invites her old pal Bijou ( Veronica Sywak ) to hang out with her and boyfriend Colby ( Callard Harris ) . Mandi and Colby are those beautiful , privileged kids from wealthy families while Bijou , from a more modest background , has grown into an alcoholic , smoking cigs and weed , without a care in the world . This kind of attitude would be okay in Fiji where Bijou could party hard , but into the heart of the jungle or through the back roads of New Guinea where local village militias and street thugs with guns and rifles are present , her belligerent , care-free nature & drunkenness soon rubs her company the wrong way . Making matters worse is Colby's invite to their jungle excursion for bartender Mikey ( Nick Richey ) , a rowdy , hard-drinking joker , like Bijou ( . . which is why they hit it off almost instantly ) with a short temperament , whose uncontrollable outbursts often almost get the gang into deep trouble . But , Mikey knows where to get the map whose directions lead them to the place the man they're after would be located . Soon , Mandi and Colby find themselves bickering endlessly with Mikey and Bijou regarding keeping with a tact schedule throughout their arduous journey through the jungles of New Guinea . While Mandi and Colby wish to keep a proper schedule in place to save time , Bijou and Mikey wish to drink and smoke , not as serious about the task at hand . Soon Bijou and Mikey take a raft made by natives , and take to the river , while Mandi and Colby discover that their supplies have been removed . Only tragedy awaits when the primitives expose themselves , bodies painted and armed with spears . Before these circumstances , Mikey had removed sacred skulls from a ritualistic shrine of the primitives , and the gang encountered an Aussie who has lived amongst the natives peacefully , forewarning them to leave well enough alone or else . Failed attempt at reviving the cannibal genre , with incredibly stupid characters ( . . even if there is a possibility for making money with an interview , why leave the picturesque fun & sun of Fiji for such a difficult undertaking as an expedition into the heart of a jungle of cannibals ? ! ) who will undoubtedly annoy viewers . If you do not care for these people , how can we possibly attach ourselves to their plight ? And , this film doesn't deliver on the more exploitive elements cannibal fans are accustomed to . The film has little to recommend except some professional camera-work and solid editing , something that's often criticized when a film is mostly shot through the use of camcorders . The violence , by the natives to those who enter their territory , happens out of frame , or shot from such a distance , that they fail to shock you . . . especially if you've seen " Cannibal Holocaust " which is superior in practically every way . You mostly see the aftermath of those who were killed and ripped apart by the natives , discovered by Mandi and Colby's camera . I guess the most shocking portion of the film is Mandi and Colby's discovery of what happened to Christian missionaries " bringing the word " to the New Guinea natives . That and the horrifying outcome of what the natives do to Bijou and Mikey , two characters who are impossibly grating . I think this was an attempt to add a modern take on Ruggero Deodato's " Cannibal Holocaust " without the very things that film had which people look for in this type of sub-genre .
The Scarecrow passes off a few thoughts on HotD 2	Terrible , boring zombie sequel is only marginally better than Uwe's horrible first film . It consists of a group of soldiers going into a zombie plagued college campus to find a certain type of blood which could assist in finding a cure for the infection . These soldiers are your typical lambs to the slaughter and none of them are that drawn out ( or at least aren't very interesting ) so you don't feel a sadness at the pit of your stomach when they are disposed of . The film has the typical zombies biting humans and blood splatter . It even has the same munching on guts . It just doesn't do anything for the zombie genre to give it memory . And , the story's climax is rather anti-climactic and ridiculous . One wonders how two people can submerged in an army of zombies and not get bit ( for they are the main stars who seem to always manage escapability ) while others seem to get bit rather easily . The film sole motivation is to show people getting bit . . nothing else . Just go watch a Romero film for lasting effect .
Unhappy Campers . . Unhappy Movie-watcher	Absolutely putrid slasher film has not one redeeming quality . It has Camp Councellor Angela ( Pamela Anderson . . awful as the killer ; her quips when she wastes people aren't even amusing ) on the warpath slaying teenagers who act the least bit naughty or resist her pleadings for good behavior . We run the gamut of boring , clichéd killings such as the slashing to the throat to one kid looking for his Freddy clawed glove , a kid who gets a chainsaw , one girl who gets drilled , one who gets shoved into the crapper ( filled with leeches ) , one who is roasted , etc . It doesn't have one original idea to offer and is merely a waste of time . That is unless you want to see Valerie Hartmen's ( who plays the slut Ally ) tits . Most of the violence occurs off-screen so even that will not satisfy .
Silent Night , Deadly Night Part1 . . OOps , I mean part 2	Ricky ( Eric Freeman ) , the brother of Billy ( the killer from the first film ) is the psycho donning the Santa outfit . . well , for a moment or two . . this time , explaining to a psychiatrist what occurred to his brother years back . This screen time is merely a shameless excuse to save money while taking cash from paying customers who ventured in to see it . They practically show most of the first film and then we get thirty or so minutes of Ricky killing people . The most inventive kill comes when he attacks bookie with an umbrella that opens after being thrusted through the stomach . He provides us with little snippets of his past while chatting with the psychiatrist ( . . who stupidly insisted that a security guard wait outside the room . . this understanding that he's in the room with a man who shot numerous people for no reason whatsoever ) . We get a little understanding of a possible love-life with Elizabeth Kaitan's Jennifer . There's a confrontation with Jennifer's former boyfriend who has a smart-Aleck mouth and says the wrong thing which sets off Ricky's trigger leading to the use of jumper cables as a weapon ! The film has a truly sickening scene where Ricky goes on a shooting rampage down a suburban street killing as many innocent people as his gun allows him . Even more despicable than that is when Ricky attacks a wheel-chair bound , facially scarred nun with an ax . Eric Freeman is truly awful as the killer of the film . Even worse is how the film tries to turn this putrid slasher into a comedy . Dreadful trash .
Campfire Stories	Two unfortunate college males , heading for a shin-dig with girls , flatten their tire when coming close to hitting a hitcher ( Jamie-Lynn Sigler of " Sopranos " fame ) on some highway surrounded by woods . She leads them into the woods " to find help " and they meet a forest-ranger named Bill ( David Johansen ) around a camp fire who tells them " scary " stories supposedly teaching them lessons about life . The first is about what occurs to some idiot , scumbag jocks who mess around with a school janitor who just happens to be an escaped convict who was able to flee his asylum by murdering the psychotic doctor performing " pain threshold experiments " on him . They get in over their heads when the boys " chase " him into the woods and truly realize just who their up against . Three criminals , leather-jacket punks , and their equally repellent chick that hangs with them , attack and rob a powerful motorcycle-riding ( ! ) Indian with a magic bag . They start smoking his stash of wacky weed and suffer horrifying hallucinations which will effect them physically as it does mentally . Two young couples stay at a country-house for the night for a little game of " truth and dare " , drinking , and sex while a killer begins to pick them off one by one while filming the action on video camera . Poorly produced , gore-less , and about as scary as a Sesame Street episode . The violence almost completely takes place off-screen and it is apparently ( because the whole film seems shot on someone's camcorder ) because of a zero budget . Each story within the film is yawn-inducing instead of gripping and the entire cast elicit little sympathy from the viewer . The second story has horrendous computer effects during the hallucination sequences . David Johansen as the story-teller Ranger Bill is laughable . Jamie-Lynn Sigler as Natalie the hitch-hiker barely registers .
The Hunger	If not for David Bowie's short but strong performance , some good aging make-up effects , three beautiful leads the camera adores , and a token lesbian sequence between major actresses you'd normally not see partaking in this sort of thing ( Scott's lone accomplishment in this film , because it's sure not the terrible editing job ) this hunk of smutty bile , director Scott would hope you'd find a stylish vampire tale , would be less of a discussed cult item . Scott tries to pass this thing off as an erotic European type of vampire horror cinema , but all the doves , windy see-through flowing curtains , and blood trickling in specific arty shapes down skin , can not salvage no content in story or plot . A terrible film . Oh , the synopsis , or lack there of . . a vampire femme , Miriam ( the lovely Catherine Deneuve who brings little depth to this character . . perhaps the script provided little chance to do so ) from Egypt with her pendant always hanging from the neck , watches as her chosen lover John ( David Bowie ) is beginning to rapidly age with no stop in sight . She wishes to put him away up stairs in a casket letting him realize that the whole " you'll live forever " has it's disadvantages . We also see that other caskets join him as she fondly speaks to each love personally . Her next conquest id Dr . Sarah Roberts ( Susan Sarandon ) whose field of study is immortality . . or slowing the aging process down using primates dying of a rare aging disease as guinea pigs . The film shows how Sarah succumbs to Miriam's cold advances ( one of many failures . . this supposed bond comes off unsuccessfully because Scott doesn't allow the plot to grow ; they meet and have sex without much room for small-talk ) and faces " the hunger " . . that yearning for blood that drives the vampire . Cliff De Young portrays Sarandon's lover and colleague at the government funded institute they work .
Poltergeist III	Carol Anne is sent to live with her aunt and uncle ( . . because actor Craig T Nelson & JoBeth Williams knew better than to return for another bad sequel ) , Bruce and Pat Gardner ( Tom Skerritt & Nancy Allen ) in a posh newly built skyscraper , attending a school for gifted students with psychological problems . Her cynical psychiatrist , Dr . Seaton ( Richard Fire ) reawakens the dormant Reverend Kane ( Nathan Davis , taking over for the late Julian Beck ) while putting Carol Anne under hypnosis , and he returns to torment the girl , using mirrors as a method of travel . Soon Bruce's daughter Donna ( Lara Flynn Boyle ) and Donna's boyfriend Scott ( Kipley Wentz ) are captured along with Carol Anne by Kane , held hostage on " the other side " and it will be up to him and Pat , with help from Tangina ( Zelda Rubinstein ) who felt Kane's emergence immediately flying to Chicago to the aide of Carol Anne , in order for their safe recovery . . their love will have to relinquish them from the clutches of Kane , who wishes to find the light . Embarrassing close to the franchise , a soulless exercise in special effects with more mirror gags than I ever want to see again . Most of the film features an endless series of special effects sequences with little care given to the characters , and leads Skerritt and Allen must keep a straight face during attacks by frozen cars in the high rise's parking garage , and their daughter's exit from the petrified corpse of Tangina . You have a watery hole , in the parking garage , with arms pulling Carol Anne into the other side , Pat and Bruce caught in an elevator falling at great speed , evil reflections serving as doppelgangers for those Kane wishes to torment , and lots of dry ice . Kane is little more than a tool used to create goofy special effects , rather than an effectively creepy character produced by Julian Beck . You see Kane pop up from time to time in mirrors ( . . one scene shows a row of Kanes looking out of rooms as characters move down the hall , followed by closed doors ) and he's even beheaded by a shovel , his face melting away . Heather O'Rourke's little shoulders have to sustain the anvil of mediocrity this terrible film places on her . Such a tragedy that such a little girl would die so young and not get an opportunity to better service her career from junk such as this sequel . Rubinstein's Tangina has become a joke , her dialogue no longer substantial , but cringe-inducing . Glossy cinematography and a nice homage to Sampson from the second film ( . . an important necklace around Tangina's neck becomes vital to possibly rescuing those captured ) help a little , but the almost complete reliance on special effects weighs down any positives in the film's favor . And , Scott's whereabouts remain a mystery leaving a gaping hole in the plot ( . . along with how certain effects sequences are stuck together with tape and super glue ) and the character of Seaton , who has a ridiculous theory regarding Carol Anne's ability to cause mass hypnosis , was obviously created as a way of poking fun at know-it-all psychiatrists who think they always have an answer for the unexplained and supernatural , no matter how remarkably asinine their logic sounds . It's simply sad that this would be O'Rourke's last completed film . The pits .
Burial Ground : Nights of Terror	Dinner guests for a professor / archaeologist find out they're on the menu instead when the undead , from a crypt unearthed by their host , come a calling . While this might appeal to zombie fans ( . . and , from what I hear , this flick has quite a following ) , I thought it was rather poor with no real explanation as to why the dead would rise and behave in the fashion of George Romero's zombies eating flesh and innards . Bizarre angle where a " young boy " Michael ( Peter Bark who actually looks older than the actress portraying his mother ) lusts after his mommy Evelyn ( Mariangela Giordano , who really loves to widen her eyes ) groping her sexually in one scene . The zombies are often merely extras wearing Halloween masks . . that's how effective some of them aren't . There are scenes of gut-munching and neck ripping for the fans who desire this sort of thing when they watch their zombie movies . Some nudity and sex . There's no plot to speak of other than one dimensional characters in search of an exit off the grounds of their host's castle with slow zombies lumbering after them . An eerie electronic score ( think " Forbidden Planet " ) does add ambiance where the film often fails to deliver .
Rottweiler	Typically awful Yuzna exercise , this time mining the " monster dog " genre having this human-eating , bloodthirsty mutt chasing convict Dante ( William Miller ) through this totalitarian country . He is bitten twice by it , but somehow , despite how others are torn to shreds , escapes his clutches . This film embarrassingly finds numerous ways , when there shouldn't be none , for Dante to constantly evade dire harm . It's essentially a series of near-death scenarios as he is caught by one prison guard with cowboy boots ( ? ! ) who was in possession of the rottweiler , is pretty much raped by some former-whore named Alyah ( Paulina Gálvez ) , who becomes lunch , with a daughter , runs into three drug-runners who are interested in the boots he stole from the prison guard he blows away , and finally makes it to this metallic city ( which resembles Pittsburgh or Chicago ) where prostitution runs supreme with constant trafficking of drugs and narcotics . Dante's memory has been dodgy since beaten to a pulp by the sickening leader , Kufard ( Paul Naschy out of all people . . inspired casting , I'm sure ) of this country's prison unit , or whatever it is , and he pursues the love he was separated from when circumstances brought them apart . There's this game called Infiltration where certain products of wealth ( Dante and Ula ) see if they can escape dangerous , patrolled waters . . whatever . Dante spends most of his quest searching for Ula ( Irene Montalà ) when he isn't barely surviving the killer dog out for blood . There are certain repressed memories Dante is trying to retrieve and it concerns what happened that night he and Ula were caught by Kufard . This also concerns the reason the rottweiler is beyond mortal . . it had some sort of scrape with Dante resulting in it's skeletal structure ( . . and teeth ) being changed partially into metal which means it can rip people apart for the hell of it without anyone doing much to him . He's pretty much a robotic killing machine . This film contains some graphic neck attacks among other flesh ripping from the killer mutt . Yuzna shows it pulling away vital organs from the torsos of victims , chomping on the skin around the skeletal remains of human meat , etc .
Midnight 2 : Sex , Death & Videotape	A sequel shot on video from director John Russo has a psychopath , Abraham ( Matthew Jason Walsh taking the place of John Amplas from the first film ) , the only survivor of those backwoods Satanist killers from the first film , is hunting victims across Pittsburgh luring females to their doom through the use of a camcorder and his charms ( . . although , the targets must be pretty desperate to fall for this guy who'd give most chicks the creeps ) . In the same methods used by his family in the first film , he bounds his victims to a wooden chair in a confined room ( . . in this film , the basement of a house he's renting ) , torturing them to death . Rebecca ( Jo Norcia ) , a pal of Jane ( Lori Scarlett ) who we see strangled by the film's killer while having sex , decides to risk her life by baiting Abraham , so that a detective , assisting her in the disappearance case of Jane , can ensnare him . But , what Rebecca doesn't realize is that when Abraham studies a potential victim , he keeps tabs on her , and finds that she is spending free time with the detective , concocting a murderous scheme of his own . Extremely low budget feature loses the creepy aesthetic that made the original Midnight so interesting . Perhaps it's the decision to shoot on video that does this film in because the effects used in the sequel are limited , and there's no doubt that Savini's work in the previous Midnight are unmatched in quality . Russo has his killer talking , talking , talking the audience to boredom . Instead of actually performing the torturous methods he has prepared for his victims , he embellishes through dialogue to them how he'll harm them . The film consists of a hell of a lot of footage from the previous film , perhaps in a move to pad this even to 70 or so minutes . I found it incredibly tedious as Abraham can't shut up , with Russo , as writer , having his psycho embracing his audience with the inner-workings of a wickedly sick mind , breathlessly chatting away about his " career " and the pleasures that derive from it . He also dotes on perhaps losing the urge to kill if he could find someone to love . I found lead Walsh rather unconvincing and not the least bit chilling , frightening or effective as the killer . He gave off nothing that would send shivers down my spine . Maybe it's his incessant talking for a great deal of the running time , looking at us the audience with a constant grin , that left me wanting to eject the disc to call it a day . I dunno . The acting , from local Pittsburgh theater types I guess , doesn't knock your socks off , and Rebecca's laughable attempts to escape ( . . where she runs to trying to either hide or get away ) induces groaning . This film has been pretty obscure , a hard-to-find film many fans of the first have been seeking after . I hope it's worth the wait for you , because it left me rather underwhelmed to say the least .
Frankenstein Meets the Spacemonster	Aliens from a planet devastated by an atomic war seek Earth women for new breeding stock to re-populate their nearly extinct species ( . . looking human with costumes reminiscent of the old Flash Gordon serials from long ago ) landing in their little space pod on a stretch of land in San Juan , Puerto Rico . Princess Marcuzan ( Marilyn Hanold , wearing a funny hat ) & her lieutenant Dr . Nadir ( Lou Cutell , with an applied dome and pointy ears ) have their men interrupting NASA's series of take-offs by blowing their space vehicles to pieces . One such interruption messes up scientist Adam Steele's ( a young James Karen of " Return of the Living Dead " fame ) mandroid operating the vessel , creating a fusion of hysteria , confusion , and mania , while also badly damaging one side of Frank's ( Robert Reilly ) face . Frank comes across several innocent bi-standers trying to defend themselves , killing the folks by strangulation or machete ( . . one fellow was chopping wood , attempting to defend himself and being hacked to death in the process , off-screen ) while traveling incoherently from one place to the next with seriously troubled programming that needs repairing . Steele and his assistant Karen ( Nancy Marshall , who cares for Frank ) travel with military man , General Bowers ( David Kerman ) to San Juan where Frank was located . . the exact same place where the alien ship had landed . While kidnapping bikini-clad hotties touring the beaches or go-go dancing , Princess and Nadir test their captive women for " purification " while Steele and Karen find Frank really in a worsening state . Karen is told to go for help while Steele works on his creation but she is kidnapped by Pricess ' men and caged near their pet furry monster Mull . Seeking information from Karen , soon Steele and Frank find the whereabouts of the alien ship . Steele will have Frank stay near the ship as he goes to call Bowers to cease firing on the aliens for fear of killing innocent women inside . But , Princess ' men drag Frank inside ( why ? ) and leave him on a table unguarded while they plan to blast off in fear of suffering major damage . But , Frank has other plans and a battle with the beasty Mull will commence with hopes of Karen and the other captured girls hoping to escape . Terrible make-up effects , cheap sets , badly inserted archival footage , clumsy dubbing , and hilarious monster are either a glutton of punishment or amusement for the viewer . Hanold and Cutell seem to know what kind of movie they're stuck in , and , as the evil alien leaders , play their roles with a sense of fun . . a tongue-in-cheek attitude by them , with Hanold stuck in a funny costume and Cutell in silly alien make-up , they are able to chew scenery . I especially enjoy the homo-erotic sequence where Hanold's Princess is getting a good look at one of her collected specimens as Nadir grins widely . Reilly walks around in a stooper , with a silly-putty face disfigurement for a large portion of the film , when he isn't attacking some poor soul . His fight with the monster is a real hoot . Fans of Ed Wood and Grade-Z schlock will get a kick out of this more than anyone else . There's no reason why Frankenstein's name should even be mentioned in this movie or it's title . Used probably to sucker viewers to the drive-ins to see it . Some 60's songs and odd musical arrangements are layered throughout this disaster of a film . This is indeed a turkey sure to delight fans of rancid cinema .
Slaughter of the Vampires	A vampire ( a hammy Dieter Eppler who moves as fast as lightning with little to no dialogue ) terrorizes Aristocrat married couple Wolfgang ( Walter Brandi ) and large-chested Louise ( the ravishing Graziella Granata ) in an old granite castle where he rests his coffin in the wine cellar . The vampire also eyes the other females ( including the little girl of a gardener as well ) . . he just wishes to infect as many of the ladies as possible . It will be up to Dr . Nietzsche , vampire slayer ( Luigi Batzella , always puffing a cigar ) to stop the bloodthirsty menace or else . Despite lavish castle setting and the ruins around it , good fluid camera-work , and attractive lighting , this flick suffers from really bad dialogue and dubbing that's hard to shake off . It has too many dull patches and often feels a lot longer than 80 minutes . Eppler isn't very impressive as the vamp despite having a towering presence . . something's wrong with that . Granata as the fetching Louise makes delicious eye candy . Bloodless bite sequences and we never see puncture wounds where the vampire bites his victims despite those neckless gowns Granata wears ( and with such an enticing neck , wounds should certainly show ) only adds to the problems of the film .
Mansion of the Living Dead	Four strippers are sent by their travel agent to a supposed paradise which turns out to be an empty , but gorgeous location with a hotel without guests and a creepy manager , Carlos ( Antonio Mayans ; a frequent Franco collaborator ) who keeps a naked woman , Olivia ( Eva León ) chained in a room , tormenting her by keeping food just out of reach . He also has a loony gardener , Marleno ( Albino Graziani ) who likes to pester the girls , when he's not whistling or singing to his beautiful flowers outside the hotel . But , outside the hotel , the girls notice that there are no tourists . Just the oddball Carlos and his nutty gardener . But , the girls , one by one , will soon discover who awaits them not too far from the hotel , restless spirits of accursed Inquisition dressed in monk robes , chanting from within their abbey sacrificing each female soul to Lucifer , condemned to worship him thanks to the power of a witch , Irina burnt at the stake who cast a spell on them . One of the strippers , Candy ( Lina Romay , who barely ever wears clothes , I don't think I've ever seen a more uninhibited woman in all my life ) could very well be the reincarnated spirit of Irina and Carlos is actually a limbotic spirit , real and yet unreal . When he's within the abbey walls , he's seen in a rotted form ( . . his face is covered in a type of waxy substance ) underneath his robe , watching as his brethren takes turns sexually molesting each female victim , serving their Prince of Darkness before plunging a dagger in them . Carlos believes that if Candy is in fact Irina , her kiss to him can set their souls free , no longer to serve their dark lord . Well , that's what I got out this Franco flick . When he sets up the first scene as we see these " undead " monks chanting a rather harmonic tune , the wind ever present , you kind of get an idea that something within the atmosphere of this place in unstable . He is able to display this by showing the wind as it generates a type of rage , also arranging the furious sound of wind on the soundtrack . It only happens when the girls make the unfortunate mistake of nearing and entering the abbey . This is a place of unrest and , I felt , not of our realm . I was a bit miffed with the sub-plot regarding Olivia , but I think she's kept by Carlos as a reminder of what causes such discomfort , the desires of the flesh , and a longing for lustful embrace . Maybe , that's why he mistreats her . She's an outward expression of what torments him from the inside . I love the location and the desolation . Something about the absence of people creates a sense of foreboding . Where is everybody ? Such a beautiful place remains so unoccupied . What gives ? That worked well for me , as did the way Jess creates the atmosphere around the abbey . Many might find some of the Inquisition monks very similar to the Blind Dead Templars . There's lots of naked flesh , drooping breasts which hardly ever remain covered , and lesbian activity ( Lina is a wild cat in this one , even proclaiming how she likes " tree-hugging " , at one time spitting out a hair caught in her teeth ) . If you do not like Jess ' camera work , or the way his female characters walk around naked desiring sex , stay far away .
Blade in the Dark	Film composer Bruno ( Andrea Occhipinti ) has the misfortune of adding his score to a horror film inspiring a sadistic killer to butcher various women who have a specific relationship with the mysterious Linda who resided in the place before he began leasing it from the owner ( Michelle Soavi ) for a short stay . Sandra ( Anny Papa ) is the female horror director and Julia ( Lara Naszinsky ) is his jealous girlfriend . The film will open doors for both ladies to possibly be suspects . But , if you are keen enough ( . . and really care enough ) , you might see , and hear , a few winks from the filmmakers who it actually might be . That's up for you to decide because it was awfully hard making it past the horrendous dubbing ( some of the sorriest , no-account dubbing ever applied to layer Italian actors . . so bad one actor's voice often interrupts or overlaps another's ) and numbingly dumb dialogue . The film does have a visual flourish and the score ( both the electronic , pulsing beat and loud sound effects within such as increasing heart beats , breathing , etc ) is terrific . It has some stunningly sadistic violence ( the oft-mentioned bathroom sequence which is brutal and the choking of a victim with missing film strip ! ) , but labors along far too long holding the viewer at bay tediously . Instead of packing a punch in pacing the flick , it just goes on and on and on . . It lacks the frenetic energy Lamberto Bava would later inhibit in the far superior DEMONS . BLADE IN THE DARK just has too many numerous problems to overcome .
See No Evil	Pro wrestler Kane stars as Jacob Goodnight , a humongous psychopath , who was the victim of a nasty religious fanatical mother during childhood ( . . we see in his recollecting memories , as a child being locked in an animal cage as a result of looking at dirty mags ) , venting his anger on a group of correctional kids from male and female facilities , hoping to remove a year from their various prison sentences by cleaning up a dilapidated old hotel , reeking of rats , roaches , rust , and garbage . Goodnight knows all the rumoured secret passages throughout the hotel and spies on the kids and their guardians , a cop who shot the psycho in the head four years previous after losing his arm by an ax chop , and the female corrections officer , contemplating a marriage proposal . Over an extended night of horror the characters will meet their gruesome fates one by one as Goodnight removes their eyes from the sockets , placing them in jars of water . One female , though , Kira ( Samantha Noble ) is spared from being killed because she has a large tattoo of a cross marking down her back . In his previous murderous rampage , a young woman was also spared because she had a cross tattoo . . although her eyes were removed . In order for any of the kids to survive , they must work together to stop Goodnight who wields a mean axe and often whips a chained hook which catches his prey from quite a length . The hotel has penthouse floors gutted by fire from long ago which killed the owner of the hotel and his wife and sent the place into ruin . Hobos made the hotel their home , before meeting Goodnight sealing their fates . . this is why you'll see numerous dead homeless folks lying all over the place . There's also a hidden room rumoured to carry a safe holding the former hotel owners private holdings in a safe . Standard slasher fare has plenty of ultra-violence to feed the gorehounds . One rich bitch , put in prison for shoplifting , meets her end as Goodnight finds a unique way of shutting her up through a ringing cell phone . Goodnight often likes to lift his victims in the air , clutching their throats with his monstrous grip , slamming them against walls . One victim is hoisted in the air with her head crushing the ceiling of an elevator leaving part of her scalp . Another receives the chained hook thrusted into his throat . Another victim receives the shock of a taser in his throat and safe which crushes his ribs . In a sense of grim irony , one girl , sent to prison for an act to save animals , meets her end by the ones she cares deeply for . I think Kane is an ideal psycho and meets the requirements of hulking monster who really looks the part as he stalks his prey . And , the setting really works as the characters run for their lives trying to outsmart their adversary any way they can . But , director Gregory Dark is like a kid with a brand new toy as his camera speeds up while often shaking obnoxiously , with the lens either shuttering or at different angles . There are quick cuts which break the action that I found rather tiresome , to be honest . I felt Dark really wanted to bring a specific style to this film so that he could make up for it's rather derivative premise . But , Dark's film is a run-of-the-mill slasher and no matter what he tries to do with his camera ( . . and through the editing process ) , he can not mask what SEE NO EVIL is . I'm sure this will satisfy those blood-thirsty slasher fans who merely want death and carnage . Speaking for myself , I'll probably forget it by tomorrow . Oh , and the characters couldn't die fast enough , and what is funny about this film is that the most loathsome character , a real cruel prick named Michael ( Luke Pegler ) , becomes the savior for the chosen " final girls " of the screenplay . Go figure . Goodnight's fate is pretty neat , though . . and what a dog does as it urinates , breaking the closing credits for a moment , is grotesquely amusing .
Graduation Day	High school female track star dies of a blood clot after winning a race with the community in an uproar against Coach George Michaels ( Christopher George playing him as a major butt-head who is VERY demanding of the athletes under his watch ) . He'll be canned after school lets out providing the flick with his motive as a possible killer . Some twisted psychopath in sweats ( much the same as what Michaels is often seen wearing ) , using a stop watch to time his executions , murders the members of the track team the dead female runner was a part of . Soon disturbed parents call Principal Guglione ( Michael Pataki ) wondering why their children didn't come home after a prom party . Inspector Halliday ( Carmen Argenziano ) begins snooping around campus at worried parents ' request . Instantly a beleaguered Michaels becomes a prime suspect after the body of a gymnast is found in a locker . Ensign Anne ( Patch Mackenzie ) returned home from her base in Guam to receive her dead track sister's diploma and soon confronts the killer herself in the climactic chase scene . Kevin Badger ( E Danny Murphy ) is the weary boyfriend of the lost track star . Rather leisurely paced slasher spreads out the death sequences quite a bit trying to mix humor within and rather failing miserably . Low-quality kill sequences only increase the laughter such as a sword embedded within a football thrown into the stomach of a football player or a pair of garden shears used to behead a poor soul taking a leak . Linnea Quigley has an amusing role as horny student Dolores who sleeps with her music teacher for a higher grade and always chases after a male stud ( the recipient of the garden shears before he has a chance to bed Dolores outside of the prom party ) . Vanna White has an early role here as a ditsy blonde who discovers the dead gymnast's body in the locker . Virgil Frye has a silly role as an inept officer .
Kaw	Ravens , infected by Mad Cow Disease when they ate from the dead cows of an Amish-like Minnonites community farm , lead a mass revolt descending upon a snowy , small town hungry for any type of flesh that can satisfy their appetites . On the final day of his job as sheriff , Wayne ( Sean Patrick Flanery ) encounters a crisis that affects his whole town as huge , menacing ravens attack in packs leaving several citizens and passersby dead and their flesh torn to pieces . He must find a way to defend his people against these deadly ravens or else perish in the process . There's an army of these birds and they return in waves , always ready for human flesh . Stephen McHattie is Clyde , an alcoholic school bus driver trying to stay sober for love-interest Betty ( Michelle Suquet ) , who runs a little gas station / diner . Kristin Booth is Wayne's photographer wife , Cynthia , for whom he's giving up his sheriff's position so she can have a career as a teacher of anthropology . Veteran Rod Taylor ( the hero in Hitchcock's The Birds ) stars as the town doctor / coroner . Vladimir Bondarenko is Jacob , the religiously fanatical Minnonite who blames the curse of their cows and rampaging predatory birds on the English for he feels their people joining amongst them in activities was against God's will . He is able to hold his son Oskar ( John Ralston ) to silence over the cows keeping the disease a secret from the town . Megan Park is Oskar's daughter Gretchen who , along with Doris ( Ashley Newbrough ) and Connie ( Emma Knight ) , become trapped on a bus when the ravens attack as Clyde attempts to fix his engine while their coach Emma ( Amanda Brugel ) tries to assist him . I watched the R-rated version which contains some pretty gory flesh eating such as when a couple , lost on a road near the town , are under attack swerving upside down into a ditch . . while the car explodes , a bird is shown tearing away at the flesh wound of a gash on the leg of the woman slung from the vehicle . After an attack on Clyde's dog , Wayne stops by the man's house finding the poor canine being fed from by a raven chewing away . Another great scene , my favorite of the film , has Cynthia stopping off by Jacob's Minnonite farm to bring a picture-book and falling into a well containing the skinned carcass of a cow ! Another suspenseful scene has this poor child , off his bicycle , surrounded by a circle of ravens around him . Most of the attacks are shown from afar as birds form a massive attack covering their victims . . we see their destruction afterward as nasty flesh wounds are shown on the dead victims . The ending is a bit too much , however . Has a nifty attack on the main characters as they try to survive a final major swarm upon them in Betty's diner . There's an obvious influence from Hitchcock's The Birds ( I mean Rod Taylor's presence in the film assures at least that ) , but " Kaw " gives an explanation to the devastation that occurs by the ravens . The film is basically " The Birds " using modern movie techniques like CGI . We see birds flying towards ( . . and in waves around ) the screen , into the sky , going into / flying out of trees , and on top of buildings . The cast is okay . . not as interesting as the one in " The Birds " , but they are really in " Kaw " to elicit fear and anxiety as the ravens come after them . Great to see Rod Taylor show up in this film , though . Might be of interest for fans of the " animals run amok " horror sub-genre . The ending is a bit too much , however . And , that one sequence when the ravens attack the school bus by throwing stones they gather in their claws is just ridiculous .
Gargoyle-Wings of Darkness	Underneath a Romanian Catholic church's graveyard lies a breeding ground of eggs containing gargoyles an evil priest is harvesting for Armegeddon as the mother creature is out flying the skies looking for victims to munch on . Michael Paré and Sandra Hess are American agents working on a case regarding a criminal who was snatched away by the mother gargoyle monster , trying to determine what had caused his death , among a string of attacks concerning the beast . Kate Orsini is an art curator helping to restore and modernize the Catholic church where creepy corrupt priest Fintan McKeown is secretly working against his clergy hoping to unleash an army of hatched gargoyles on an unsuspecting public . Petri Roega is a priest sent by the Vatican to replace McKeown and indeed knows what his plans are . Paré will hook up with Orsini after reporting to her after learning about her missing co-workers . . in their search for truth regarding bizarre crime scenes and elaborate pictures of gargoyles found in a book of study on McKeown's desk ( . . not to mention Orsini's discovery of a missing painting hidden in the Catholic church she is working on containing a gargoyle ) they will soon learn about a special crossbow and blood-blessed arrows meant to use on the mother gargoyle sweeping down and snatching human food . Tim Abell , a Wynorski regular , has a supporting role as Lex , a showman who passes himself off as a cult leader of vampirism finding a devoted following of goth-obsessed flunkies who frequent his club for kicks . Abell sees himself what the gargoyle can do when it swoops down taking out a gang of thugs who wish to take over Bucharest's streets . Another Wynorski regular Arthur Roberts has a small role as a Bishop who lives within the ruins of a castle on the outskirts of Bucharest who holds the special crossbow and gives knowledge to Paré and Orsini regarding the gargoyle on the loose . Serious creature feature from Wynorski plays it completely straight unlike his usual efforts , certainly relies heavily on computer generated monsters which look more like giant bats when cloaked in the darkness of night or within the catacombs underneath the graveyard . Wynorski does , when given a chance , direct films geared towards fans of sci-fi / horror / action , but rarely has sufficient funds to finance a feature with superior special effects . When the gargoyle charges towards the camera , that's when the computer generated effects are truly exposed . Wynorski actually focuses more on plot than usual with a cast keeping a straight face with Paré coasting on his charisma . I think fans of Sci-fi channel monster movies will find this better than most of their usual fare , but I'm not sure that's an insult or a compliment for Wynorski's movie . I love gargoyles , but even the finest CGI monster would pale in comparison to the animatronic wonders created by the ingenuity and artistic skill of the crew for the " Lover's Vow " tale in Tales from the Darkside-The Movie ( 1990 ) . Like other directors who wish not to give their correct name in the directorial credit , Wynorski uses the alias of Jay Andrews . The movie doesn't really separate itself from the gluttony of monster movies that have populated Sci-fi channel over the years so don't expect any really big surprises .
Shredder	A group of snowboarders take up lodging at closed ski resort Rocky Summit , have their hands full with a psychopathic skier . It seems this skier has a major problem with snowboarders and it may or may not have something to do with the accidental death of a little girl . . who died thanks to drunken snowboarders . Lots of " dude-speak " with this cast of stereotypical clichéd characters ( especially Billy O'Sullivan's Skyler who , if he didn't look human , would pass for a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle ) who love to drink and party . You have Scott Weinger as the hunky Cole , being led around like a puppy by the manipulative hottie bitch Kimberly ( Lindsey McKeon , playing the kind of blonde product of wealth you just want to see die horribly ) . You have Holly Towne as the horny Robyn ready for just about anyone to mount her , Brad Hawkins as Christophe , a young supposed Frenchman with a direct link to the dead girl of legend at the slopes , Juleah Weikel as Pike , who is believed lesbian but is actually head-over-heels for Cole & Peter Riggs as a star of snowboarding who loves the weed . The locals around the lodge dislike snowboarders and there's a beautiful chick named Shelly ( Candace Moon ) who likes to ski in the nude . Okay slasher , could've been better , could've been worse . Somewhat more entertaining than the usual modern slashers of it's ilk . The film is helped a great deal by it's setting and there are quite a few bloody , gory bits to keep fans of the genre satisfied . The title of the film is a term to describe a snowboarder .
Man's Best Friend	From the " killer canine cannon " comes this mediocre horror outing , Man's Best Friend , regarding a genetically enhanced mutt with DNA of many dangerous animals injected into it making the dog particularly lethal towards those that tick it off . A journalist looking for her big break , is invited by a nervous employee at a scientific institute run by Dr . Jarret ( Lance Henriksen ) to peek inside the corrupt practices regarding the horrifying mistreatment on animal test subjects . This employee is attacked and killed by the powerful and unpredictable canine , Max 3000 , who has been supplied a drug suppressing it's violent tendencies , but thanks in part to snooping kind-hearted journalist , Lori Tanner ( Ally Sheedy , just adorable in the movie ) , it is released from the institute and Jarret is unable to coerce it back into the cage . Hopping into Lori's vehicle , Max will soon infiltrate her life , their bond keeping her temporarily alive as it poses a threat to suburbia and everything within it . Lori's beau , Perry ( Fredric Lehne ) doesn't find Max very comforting , particularly due to the canine's jealousy of anyone coming between dog and owner . Meanwhile , a very worried Jarret , who knows that the drug he administered to the dog will only last for a certain amount of time , confides reluctantly with police detectives in finding Max before it loses control and becomes completely volatile towards everyone / everything in it's path . I imagine writer / director John Lafia had a field day coming up with ideas regarding Max and the damage he could inflict on people and animals . It actually climbs a tree after a cat and eats it . It can actually adapt to it's environment and blend in like a chameleon , doing so and frightening a couple of goofy dog-catchers away . After being sprayed in the eyes with pepper spray , Max actually hunts down and bites into the ankle and throat of a postal worker who had delivered mail to a home . A sadistic mechanic ( . . played by the surprisingly imposing William Sanderson , who rarely acts so cruel ) assaults Max with a shovel across the head , even taking to it's face with a lit blow torch , before the canine clamps down ferociously onto his crotch ! Max pisses acid into the face of a victim it doesn't like , and pretty much sexually molests a collie who attempts futilely to escape from the canine . Even an insulting parrot ( . . actually taught such naughty , inflammatory words by a neighborhood kid ) makes the wrong gesture towards Max , getting eaten ! I think Lafia , though , establishes right away that Max is a product of man's own engineering . . it would in all likelihood be a very hospitable and loving pooch if Jarret hadn't injected the DNA of a rattlesnake and tiger into it . And , we are privy to what Jarret does to his animal test subjects with the footage recorded by Lori and her camerawoman , Annie ( Trula M Marcus ) , so Max is a victim of unhealthy scientific experimentation . Henriksen , as Jarret , is often presented as desperate and scared , sweating and always urgent because he know what kind of killing machine has been released on the city . His whole career and well-being is centered on Max's protection and capture . Like many films of this nature in the 90's , punches are pulled ( . . we don't even get to see how Max killed a despicable thief who attempts to mug Lori's purse ) , with the scenes where Max attacks animals and humans not that gory as the camera immediately pulls away as it bites down or inflicts harm . This kind of film would probably be rated PG-13 and transition easily to cable television . Certainly maintains the Hollywood polish , often featuring cute comic scenes concerning Max's behavior within a normal suburban environment ( . . and it's reactions towards people and situations ) where it doesn't truly belong .
The Hills Have Eyes Part 2	A group of motorcyclists , including Ruby ( Janus Blythe ) , formerly a cannibal of the hills now reformed since leaving with the two survivors of the first film , get stranded out on the desert hills where two cannibals wreak havoc on them . The group find a compound that seems deserted , but a hidden room inside what appeared to be a refrigerator houses a place that might explain who is out there in the darkness causing so much terror . Blind Cass ( Tamara Stafford ) and others await the return of her boyfriend Roy ( Kevin Spirtas , the hero hunting down Jason Voorhies in Friday THE 13TH THE NEW BLOOD ) and Harry ( Peter Frechette ) who are chasing a cannibal survivor from the first film , Pluto ( Michael Berryman ) after he steals one of their motorbikes . This leads to both possibly being killed while the others having no idea of their condition . Slowly , each fall prey to a much more menacing cannibal , the dead Jupiter's larger brother , The Reaper ( John Bloom ) while Pluto tangles with Ruby and that blasted dog that messed him up the previous time , Beast . At night , things get really scary because those who await the return of their two men , believe they are playing a practical joke which is not unlike them ( we see both several times pulling stunts on various characters ) . In the darkness , The Reaper and Pluto have a distinct advantage . . how will a blind woman and her friends defend themselves in a place they have no knowledge of ? The film is more of a slasher flick than the great original Craven effort . This one is VERY low budget , but doesn't pack the same punch as the brutal superior original . I felt this sequel resembles the Friday THE 13Th films , not just because of the familiar Harry Manfredini score , but the methods of the killers . Like those victims of Friday THE 13TH , those who are killed normally separate themselves from the group making themselves vulnerable to attack . The film has a dirt-poor grungy quality that hearkens back to the original film , but lacks bite . This one offers some flashbacks from Bobby , the male survivor & Ruby from the previous film . . and the notorious one by the dog , Beast . I feel like this was intentional comedy on Craven's part that many just couldn't giggle at . I rather found it amusing . But , why a blind woman isn't killed immediately and instead allowed to last throughout the film ( . . and how The Reaper couldn't just escape a circle-of-fire at the end by jumping a little ) is just too ridiculous to accept .
Beyond Evil	Newly married couple , Larry and Barbara Andrews ( John Saxon & Lynda Day George ) move to a reputedly haunted mansion , Casa Fortuna , which yields a vengeful witch's spirit with strong powers . Poor Barbara's body and soul are slowly taken over by the spirit , Alma Martin ( Janice Lynde , under various wigs ) , and those Larry works with during the construction of a major hotel , such as pal Del Giorgio ( Michael Dante ) and Dr . Frank Albanos ( Mario Milano ) both men with a lot riding on the job and it's business potential , are in danger of her wrath . A worried Larry , whose own life is threatened when a crane , operated by Alma's spirit , carrying heavy material used for construction which nearly falls on top of him ( . . killing a co-worker by him ) , will seek help from a faith healer Doctor Solomon ( David Opatoshu ) . But , as Alma slowly gains control of Barbara her powers emerge , such as green laser blasts from the eyes , superhuman abilities to lift and throw men in the air , pulling a car apart before exploding it down a cliff , etc . Larry and Solomon will have to work together to somehow stop Alma from totally taking control . From the director of " Graduation Day " ( . . another Troma release ) , Herb Freed tries his hand in the demonic thriller genre . I think the cast gives it their best shot , but the budget is just too small and so many scenes show signs of post production tinkering where one scene doesn't transition smoothly to the next and the special effects ( . . particularly when Alma uses her powers , with green tint often appearing like a halo around Day George's head before she blasts somebody ) are rather cheap . I think one often needs an appropriate budget when approaching a film about demonic possession and a lot of the special effects undermine a decent effort from the director . I must also admit that there are some lighting issues , with a lot of scenes so dark you could barely see the actors , especially at night . I'm certainly not against low-budget film-making , and I think setting your film on an island inside a mansion which carries a certain flavor of it's surroundings certainly helps . I think the leads are fine . Saxon is the concerned husband , often playing him as conflicted and confused . Day George shows the battle of personalities raging inside , the sweet innocent Babs , and the evil Alma starting to take over . Lynde as Alma is actually pretty creepy with how she widens her mad eyes , opening her fingers exposing those long nails as she shoots green light . I think if Herb just had some more money , and decidedly remained away from using special effects concerning colors , he'd had a better film . But , it's assured that people will watch this with uncontrollable laughter , certainly at the special effects and perhaps hold a feeling of embarrassment for Saxon and Day George who deserve a better film . There are some make-up effects concerning Solomon's faith healing rituals where he slices open the stomach of " patients " removing the problems plaguing them ( . . one case goes wrong , to a child no less , when Alma interferes ) that work well .
Secret of the Red Orchid	The lieutenant of a Chicago crime syndicate shot down by rival gangster boss Kerkie Minelli's ( Eric Pohlmann ) hoods , Gunner Steve ( Klaus Kinski ) sets up new roots in London and is suspected of blackmailing wealthy aristocrats threatening through the use of mailed letters written in block newspaper / magazine clippings not to report to the police or else . Minelli himself , along with his gangster clan , decide to take up residence in London themselves splitting the city in two . Scotland Yard Inspector Weston ( Adrian Hoven ) convinces his superiors to join forces with American ( ! ) FBI agent Captain Allerman ( Christopher Lee ) , a cunning investigator who understands the methods of these Chicago crime families and their history offering a brand of expertise needed to take down these hoodlums who have possibly led to the murder of several wealthy citizens already . But , are these crime families really responsible for the blackmailing and murders of those aristocrats ? Or , are they merely the perfect cover for another schemer ? In an important sub-plot , Lilian Ranger ( Marisa Mell ) watches with her buffoon butler , Parker ( Eddi Aren't , the comedy relief of this crime thriller . . a running gag has him labeled the " death butler " for he winds up under the employ of every single aristocrat murdered by the blackmailing killer ) as her employer , Elias Tanner ( Fritz Rasp ) is gunned down by hoods in his own home passing themselves off as Scotland Yard guards . His bachelor nephew , Edwin ( Pinkas Braun ) , one known for being quite the playboy and ne'er-do-well , comes home supposedly from Brazil to hopefully receive an inheritance from his uncle's will . Edwin is known as an orchid hunter / enthusiast and often drops by to see Lilian , even after he finds out that his uncle has left the entire inheritance to her . Can Edwin be trusted ? Or , is he possibly secretly plotting something ? He always brings a unique orchid for Lilian when he visits her . To be honest , this crime / gangster thriller is only notable for it's cast , particularly Lee and Kinski . But , they can not save themselves from the rather dull plot or the atrocious dubbing which causes one to wince . . whoever was responsible for the voice-work , which is indeed a travesty to listen to , shouldn't have been paid a dime . It's interesting seeing Mell in this before she'd go on to become an icon in Italian cinema . One thing that just drove me bonkers was the way hoods would shoot people and the camera would close in to show that the victims of bullet-fire had no wounds or even a hint of blood . . the effect of Minelli's fate , for instance , is ruined because of a close-up showing not the slightest hint of bodily damage . The film itself is rather a bore , I must admit . But , seeing Lee and Kinski opposite each other , even if for just one scene , is quite a thrill . The film's main mystery is practically ruined by the title !
Severed : Forest of the Dead	A genetic breakthrough which can produce large trees at a quicker rate has an unfortunate side-effect . . the sap , once entered into the human bloodstream , turns humans into flesh-eating zombies , whose bite produces the same effect . Tyler ( Paul Campbell ) doesn't wish to follow in his Chairman father's footsteps , but is coerced into going to a logging site whose production has grown silent . Once there , Tyler finds that the workers , and environmentalist protesters , are raving zombies munching on mutilated bodies . Finding a logger , Luke ( Michael Teigen ) , who saves his life , they make for a makeshift shack of temporary safety containing a small motley group of frightened survivors . Rita ( Sarah Lind ) , the mastermind of the major protest against the logging company's cutting down trees , is one of the few who made it to shack , along with fellow protester Stacey ( Leanne Adachi ) . Mac ( Julian Christopher , a fatherly , trustworthy , wise , & heroic presence ) is the foreman whose men were plagued by the zombie virus thanks to a horrifying chainsaw mishap , caused by a spiked tree ( . . planted by the protesters ) , which mixes the genetically enhanced sap into a worker's wounded shoulder . Carter ( JR Bourne ) , is a wimpy , pathetic scientist , working for the company taking samples of the sap , testing it for possible dangers with the results , good or bad , sent back to the research center . Carter perhaps knows what is causing the zombie plague . Together , on foot , Tyler will lead the motley group to his truck hoping to escape with their lives intact . Rita , however , has plans to save her boyfriend , Greg ( John Reardon ) which separates them temporarily . Problems arise even when they make it to the truck , and the group find themselves , thanks to the board who forces Tyler's father to sign a decree for confinement , trapped in the camp with only a back road as a possible escape route . Things get even worse when those who somehow survive multiple zombie attacks , find themselves in the camp of another logging company , led by the massive , imposing Anderson ( Patrick Gallagher ) whose presence over the men offers just as much a threat to them as the bloodthirsty undead . This zombie film is rife with stupid human behavior , particularly by the cowardly scientist Carter , played by JR Bourne as if he were Dr . Smith of LOST IN SPACE . He quivers like a little scared child , always cowering and shaking . He is the type who doesn't help others in need , despite the rescuing he receives ( . . like when Luke saves him from an attack only to be left by Carter to fend for himself ) . Tyler makes two really dumb decisions ( . . one , obviously because without making it there wouldn't be a movie , his leaving the truck as zombies come toward him , opting instead to flee into the forest , and a second , instead of leaving with Rita when escape is possible , decides to try and help Carter who was completely surrounded by zombies with no hope , it seems , of escaping a sinister fate ) which will have you screaming at the screen . The film is shot in a frenzy , using grainy stock it seems , never keeping the camera still when the zombies make their appearances . Blood spurts in slow motion , but rarely is the true violence ( . . like our characters bludgeoning the zombies with weapons ) ever shown on screen . The zombie virus works like in the 28 DAYS / WEEKS LATER with those infected convulsing not too long after being bit . They rampage their victims just as feverishly as in Zack Snyder's DAWN OF THE DEAD remake . Actually , this film is shot very similar to Snyder's film , giving those infected little time on screen , instead almost completely focusing on the characters and their plight . This film , despite how the zombie virus starts , isn't really any different than the films that have came before it . I do think many zombie fans will like it . . many will be game for zombies in a forest , even if we rarely see true carnage ( . . there is some flesh-eating , but most of it is more implied than shown in depth ) . The cast , for the exception of Bourne , who I thought was dreadful , is actually pretty decent . I really thought Christopher , as the foreman who becomes the rock everyone leans on to stay alive , was especially good .
Last House on the Left	I can just imagine LHotL purists balking in disgust as the new remake unfolds , how the horrifying rape of a beautiful , sweet-hearted virginal teenager at the hands of the muscular , intimidating brute Krug is " tamed down " and how her pot-smoking friend is stabbed only once in the back and once in the stomach ( . . compared to the multiple stabbings in the original ) , left to die , how the camera work and lead performances of her parents , Tony Goldwyn and Monica Potter , are of a higher quality , how the violence is ratcheted up in extreme fashion at the end when revenge is sought against the thugs , how John Collingwood is made a knowledgeable surgeon whose expertise come into use to save his daughter , how the character of Mari Collingwood is a talented swimmer appropriate especially when she escapes her attackers . It's all in the details . The idea that Goldwyn's John Collingwood is a surgeon is a plot point specifically designed to save his daughter . His daughter's swimming ability is a plot point to save herself even when she's shot by Krug . The rape is carefully shot where you see no penetration , mostly just poor Sara Paxton's face as her Mari is molested and mistreated . The film allows her to get shots at the female member of Krug's brood , Sadie ( Riki Lindhome ; HACK ! ) a car cigarette lighter and a heavy stone . The brood themselves are rather colorless , not as " white trash " or ugly as the original film's nasty villains . Garret Dillahunt is nowhere even close to as imposing as David Hess in the original as Krug ( . . but those shoes couldn't be filled by anyone ) with the actor ( . . despite being athletically built , tall , and handsome ) lacking that extra edge and presence needed for this particular role . Aaron Paul , as Krug's wild-eyed , explosive brother Francis , looks the part of an unhinged thug , but lacks the quiet intimidating presence of Fred J Lincoln's Fred ' Weasel ' Podowski ( . . just the way Weasel toyed with his knife , is more creepy than anything Aaron Paul does in the entire movie ) . Riki Lindhome is simply a bitch , not the " anything goes " Sadie , Jeramie Rain portrayed with chilling realism in the original . But , there's no doubt that Potter and Goldwyn are far and away superior in the roles of the devastated and deeply wounded parents in the remake . Their breakdown in realizing that they had just provided comfort to the very thugs who raped and harmed their daughter runs rings around the performances of Richard Towers and Cynthia Carr in the original . The grisly rampage of violence is the major difference between the two . The protracted revenge lasts quite a bit longer in the remake , with superior effects and nastier attacks ( . . the use of a garbage disposal and microwave provide rather interestingly brutal results ) where a fireplace poker , hammer , butcher knife , and handgun all play important roles in how people are punished . I do believe director Dennis Iliadis does , at times , attempt to shoot the actions of characters in ways similar to how Craven did in his film , but there's certainly a polish and accomplished look that the remake has due to the much larger budget ( . . a luxury Crave didn't have when making his little exploitation shocker ) . And , this film adheres to the criticisms often made towards Craven's version . . NO COMEDY . This film is dead serious from start to finish and his straight forward , full steam ahead . Actions are in place , choices are made , and the carnage ensues . This wasn't made in the 70's and feels every bit the modern slasher variation Craven's film wasn't . . this will be a problem for LHotL faithful . The depth is removed and there's no hostile Vietnam era undercurrents at the heart . . Iliadis ' film is set in the now and simply displays two teenagers going along with the wrong young man , even though he's a baby-faced gentle lamb ( Spencer Treat Clark , as Krug's oft-abused son , Justin , a handsome kid who looks positively nothing like the freakish Marc Sheffler ) , paying the price when the kid's dangerous family arrives on them unannounced . I think a modern audience might just enjoy this remake , but I do feel that the unabashed vocal supporters of the original will hate it . I was quite surprised to see Paxton in this film , having noticed her in Disney fare before , because the poor girl goes through hell . The survival of Paxton's Mari is quite a change from the original ( . . how she could still swim back home with an embedded and bleeding bullet wound , also serves as a reason to lament ) and might provide even more disgust with purists who stand by the power of a murdered daughter and how that kind of emotional loss would properly engage such a negative reaction towards revenge . My favorite scene would probably be when Francis ' nose is reset and stitched by John , only to be broken again later .
The Scarecrow reviews " Happy Birthday to Me "	Students from an elite group of rich young adults in this private school are picked off in various bloody ways by a deranged psycho wearing leather gloves . Virginia ( Melissa Sue Anderson ) is a troubled young woman , suffering from brain trauma after a car crash , is one of " the ten " the film focuses on . The link between the repressed memories Virginia is slowly seeing and the murders unravels in the climax . . or so you think . This film is tricky , as directed by J . Lee Thompson ( the original " Cape Fear " and " 10 to Midnight " ) , and there lots of clues that lead us to at least four possible suspects . The film is slippery in how it cancels out one clue after another , but , I have to admit , the ending seems a bit tacked on as if the writers ran out of tricky gags . It is an interesting ride , however , as the bodies piles up . The film seems to want us believing it is Virginia , but the ending left me a little disappointed . Glenn Ford plays Virginia's genial doctor . . and the only one that keeps her from shifting into a complete nutcase . Her brain trauma causes hallucinations and the flashbacks that occur seem to be all part of a trick for the viewer . That's essentially what this film is to be honest . . a bag of tricks to keep you guessing . The music is perhaps the film's main weakness , particularly in the early going . That perhaps , along with the early 80's slasher mentalities , makes this film quite dated . . which can hurt or not depending on the one watching it . There is a specific angle this film constantly pokes at . . this birthday party . It's obvious really because of the film's title , but there is a repressed memory in the back of Virginia's memory hidden away under lock and key that will provide possible answers to why the kids are being killed . . and also the reason for the car crash over one of those splitting bridges { you know those that open so barges and ships on the river can cross to the other side } that caused the death of Virginia's mother . That may've worked if the writers weren't trying so hard to come up with ample doses of twists . If they would've stayed with the linking angle of the birthday instead of the final revelation of the killer . . this film could've actually been quite nifty . But , one too many twists makes this film merely an exercise .
Saw IV	If you thought the tests were over after seeing both Jigsaw and his accomplice Amanda dead by the third film's end . . nope , think again . A third accomplice is now putting several people through a test , and a black cop wanting to find his partner , will hold the lives of others in his hands , as he follows the guidance of Jigsaw ( ? ) in order to do so . This fourth film in the series further explores the evolutionary process in what motivated Jigsaw John into setting up his method for testing those who do not appreciate life in a positive way . . a philosophy that developed primarily from a series of factors we see happen in this film such as meeting John's wife , a self-help psychologist who runs a clinic designed to assist people with emotional problems , how her disrupted pregnancy at the hands of a vile petty thief ( . . and John's cancer diagnosis ) provoked his mad design , and her interrogation by Agent Strahm ( Scott Patterson ) needing answers as to how to find Jigsaw's workshop / factory . The black cop , Rigg ( Lyriq Bent ) , told by his superior , Hoffman ( Costas Mandylor ) , to step away from the case ( . . attempting to find Eric Matthews ( Donnie Wahlberg ) , a returning character from the second film ) , is provided with a chance to help " others save themselves " , in an ambiguous lesson he has yet to learn . . he's the " hero who wishes to save everybody " while his personal life has been ignored during such an impossible quest . Meanwhile , a lawyer , Art ( Justin Louis ) survives a grueling test , only ( . . it seems ) to be working for Jigsaw looking on as Hoffman ( . . who , it seems , was kidnapped as well ) and Matthews are caught in a trap designed to keep both of them alive until Rigg reaches them . Agent Strahm and his partner Perez ( Athena Karkanis ) are investigating crime scenes once Rigg has been there believing the cop could possibly be seeking a vendetta with criminals he's been associated with in the past . Betsy Russell is Jill , John's ex-wife , who relates her former husband's story to Strahm , threatening to prosecute her if she doesn't help him find Jigsaw's whereabouts . The story also coincides with what took place at the end of SAW III as Jeff ( Angus Macfadyen ) runs into a detective , while attempting to find his daughter , after executing Jigsaw John , failing his test . Convoluting as ever , SAW IV has several alternating story-lines , keeping you plenty busy . The camera work and editing process will be certain to give you a headache sometimes , particularly during Rigg's ( . . and others ) tests where director Darren Lynn Bousman can not keep the action still long enough for you to see anything clearly . There's a really nasty autopsy at the very beginning where a tape recorder is found in Jigsaw's body relating yet another message from the mastermind , even after death . The traps are just as elaborate and painstakingly designed as ever before , and I stand amazed at Jigsaw's ability to plan so well in advance just exactly how characters would react to their tests . And , the revelation of Jigsaw's second ( ? ) accomplice is a nice touch no matter how ridiculous it might seem . Let's be honest , it's highly unlikely that anyone could create such a fool-proof design where characters would precisely follow every step without fail , and end exactly as he has planned . I find it hard to believe anyone , no matter how brilliant , could create such a design so perfectly , setting up the process without one wrong detail . But , the SAW series has always operated this way . . characters are kidnapped , provided options to escape certain death , while concealed in a trap of some sort , reawakening their abandoned appreciation for life , tested concerning personal weaknesses that prevent them from living a better , more fulfilling time on earth . Rarely do any of these characters survive due to their own moral / emotional inadequacies and imperfections . And , as often is the case , those assigned to catch Jigsaw ( . . and his partners ) wind up trapped as well . Just prepare for a lot of plots interconnecting . . many viewers will perhaps become so frustrated , they'll throw their hands up . It can become tiresome after a while , and this sequel , as the others in the past , demand a lot out of the viewer because we are asked to believe that Jigsaw's scheme could operate so incredibly well , depending on peoples ' predictably due to their flaws in character . I think the series is starting to loose steam , and implausibility stands out more than ever before .
Lips of Blood	A man finds memories about a vampiress he met as a child rekindled when he sees a beautiful poster of ruins at a party . He is inspired to seek out those ruins as he sees visions of the vampiress while others try to thwart his mission to find her , such as his mother , a supposed girl he knew from childhood , a hit-man , psychiatric doctor , etc . Yet , anytime someone tries to halt the man's search for the ruins , vampire girls kill them allowing him to continue . No matter what his mother tries to accomplish , this man desires to find this vampiress and will do whatever it takes to find her . It'll come to a head at the Sauveterre Castle where the vampiress is buried . . will the man , Frederic find Jenifer ? Or , will Frederic finally listen to his mother's pleas at allowing Jenifer , the vampiress responsible for his own father's death , to roam free from the tomb of her coffin ? With limited dialogue , it seems director Jean Rollin wishes to capture you with visuals . The problem I had is the visuals are so coldly ( . . and oddly ) displayed , I had a hard time getting involved in the film . Jean-Loup Philippe bored me to tears as Frederic , the young man on his search . He barely registers as the protagonist . . actually , his method of acting blends itself well within Rollin's quiet , unenergetic direction which holds silence as things occur on screen at a snail's pace . Annie Belle ( The House on the Edge of the Park ) is a stunning beauty as the vampiress , but she , like Philippe , often stares blankly towards the screen . The film , quite honestly , has some pretty terrible vampire-bite sequences because the vampire girls simply nookie on their victims . The film is beautiful , with some haunting location work and fluid camera-movement . That alone helps , but I had a hard time staying awake through it .
Driller Killer	Unpleasant , depressing ( . . and ultimately very sick ) portrait of a mentally disturbed artist's plight and how various factors ( . . a rock band's non-stop practicing ; his gay art dealer's nasty , negative reaction to a long-waiting artistic rendering of a buffalo ; ever-growing supply of homeless living near his gloomy , smallish , yet rather ridiculously expensive flat ) lead to his psychopathic reign of terror , murdering numerous street people with a power drill . The film only sporadically ( . . but effectively ) highlights Reno's ( Abel Ferrara ) attacks on the homeless , penetrating their bodies ( . . and , in one instance , a forehead ) with a spinning drill as they shake and quiver . The meat of the film shows the grind and misery of Reno as he attempts to finish the buffalo portrait which has been a long-suffering chore which may just be why it lends to the later ridicule . His girlfriend , Carol ( Carolyn Marz ) takes a great deal of abuse , despite being quite supportive of him , even using the alimony payments from her ex-husband to pay the rent . For pleasure , a druggie , Pam ( Baybi Day ) lives in the flat with them , supplying Carol with a lover and pal . Meanwhile , the punk band , always jamming and rehearsing , are a camera mainstay , their sessions a constant in the film . Ferrara's Reno is a crude , vile jerk with little redeeming value , but perhaps he has formed into such a creature thanks to his bleak , immodest surroundings . Ferrara makes it a priority to display not only his lead character's plight but New York's as well . There's nothing remotely pretty about this film , it's an ugly , urban hell we see and the photography and characters represent this . Fans of Lustig's Maniac might embrace Driller Killer since the same kind of New York is projected in that film as well , with Spinell a mentally disturbed killer ( . . except his victims of choice are pretty women while Reno's are hobos and alley-cats ) who scowers the streets seeking fresh victims to slay . There's a really warped scene where Reno chops up a skinned rabbit . Some may consider this an accurate representation of a gritty , unglamorous city dwelling place where the undesirables go to die and innocence has no place of refuge . Ferrara's later films would definitely have better production values , be far more narratively strong , and certainly contain better casts . This film shows the signs of a new filmmaker ( . . stylistically wise , with a plodding pace that drags ) , but one willing to take daring , provocative risks .
The Strangers	Well , I finally watched it and can easily say that some decisions made really ticked me off . They just have to go and spoil the entire film ( . . the " Dark City " syndrome if you will ) by announcing not only in the narration but the opening scene displaying the " morning after " . Talk about shooting yourself in the foot . This was the same problem I had with Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE THE BEGINNING . . If you already know the victimized characters ' fates how can you really get into a film ? I wasn't drawn in because I knew it couldn't possibly go well for the couple thanks to the opening minutes summoning up their fates . And , as usual the female victim twists her ankle , makes so much racket stumbling into things people miles down the road could hear her , and she's constantly screaming . She might as well stood out in the yard with a GIANT bullseye and said " hit me with your best shot " . I will say that I thought that the filmmakers took pointers from Dean Cundy on how to lens their masked villains . . because the whole time they'd show up , Michael Myers came to mind immediately . This I liked really well , although I think the murderess in INSIDE was even better a menace , appearing from the shadows . Speaking of INSIDE , I immediately thought of a certain accidental murder that occurred in that movie and saw the surprise death in THE STRANGERS coming before it even happened . Horror has come full circle really . Used to filmmakers preyed on your fears in regards to being caught in an unfamiliar territory where no one could save you ( . . whether it be in the shower of the Bates Motel , out in the water as the Great White draws ever so close , in the farmhouse of a maniac wearing a mask made of human skin , wielding a chainsaw , in the space ship Nostromo where the alien hunts for victims or in the dark torture rooms of a faraway third-world country ) , but now there's really no escape because even in the comforts of your own home ( . . or a close relative's summer home ) the predators are around somewhere to cause terror to victims . The movie goes out of it's way to make the couple , Tyler and Speedman , stumble , trip and fall all over themselves as the kid killers , under creepy masks , stalk them quietly and methodically . It calls Columbine back to your attention and as of late , those kids haven't quite killing . THE STRANGERS , in that regard ( . . although , I'm one of those who considers ILS ( THEM ) a better candidate ) taps into something truly vital , that impacts . Too bad , the filmmakers clue us into how the whole situation will end right at the start .
The Scarecrow reviews " Crash and Burn "	Well , unlike others on here who really didn't like this film , I have to say I rather enjoyed it . It's a B-picture all the way and lifts ideas from other films ( the checking for blood is from John Carpenter's " The Thing " and the synthoid is clearly an imitation of the monster android in " The Terminator " ) , but has a capable cast who bring much to the film . It's also a rather short 80 minutes so the film doesn't outlast it's time . The plot is set in the future where the ozone layer has depleted badly and " thermo-storms " often cause havoc . The ultra-violet rays keep everyone from enjoying life outside and this totalitarian government called Unicorp runs the society of the United States . There is a secret organization called ILU which plan to overthrow this government so the Unicorp has sent out synthoids as watchdogs to keep an eye on possible suspects . On a television station ran by Ralph Waite's Lathan Hooks ( I liked Waite so much I wish he had more screen time ) . His granddaughter Arren ( a fine Megan Ward who had done some really good work for Full Moon ) knows that Lathan is secretly a part of ILU and uses the TV station as a quiet cover for the group's activities . A motorcycle courier for Unicorp named Tyson ( Paul Ganus ) brings Lathan a supply of freon and decides to stay until a thermo-storm passes the night . He and Arren bond as friends while Tyson is physically attracted to a schoolteacher named Parice ( the foxy soap opera star Eva LaRue Callahan ) . Jack McGee , a fine character actor who often plays leeches , is Winston Wickett . . a relative of a Unicorp rep which is the reason he has a sleazy talk show at Lathan's station . He has invited two porn stars , Sandra and Christie ( Elizabeth Maclellan , who is quite good in this movie , and Katherine Armstrong ) to shack up with him until the thermo-storm passes . Then there's Quinn , a handyman and electrician , played by " The Devil's Rejects " Bill Moseley . During the night someone kills Lathan and it is told that there's a synthoid loose amongst the group ( this occurs when Arren hides from the pack , finds Tyson , cuts him to see if his blood is red , and tells him about that very fact ) . Will Tyson and Arren find the synthoid before it kills the entire group ? This film actually has a decent pace and the robot effects at the end by David Allen are solid but don't last near as long as I'd have liked . Anybody that has indeed seen the low budget films , " Robot Jox " and " Robot Wars " should recognize the robot in " Crash and Burn . " Many have sided against it for being unoriginal which is a fair argument , but I have to say I enjoyed it for the cast who do bring it up more than a notch . I was entertained and this is the type of movie that might go over for genre fans with low expectations .
The Giant Claw	A giant extra-terrestrial buzzard with an anti-matter forcefield ( . . I'm not making this up ! ) is terrorizing the world , flying at intense speeds , downing vehicles in flight , chomping on parachuting innocents attempting to escape , and swooping down to cause death and destruction . It's up to our brave government and scientists to figure out how to penetrate it's forcefield so that the rockets and bullets we fire from our artillery can end it's reign of terror for good . Directed by Fred F Sears ( The Werewolf ; Earth vs The Flying Saucers ) and starring Jeff Morrow ( This Island Earth ; The Creature Walks Among Us ) as an " electronics wiz " , Mitch MacAfee who works with the military to solve the crisis regarding the anti-matter forcefield , hoping to find a flaw , creating a weapon of some sort to remove this shield used to protect itself from invading hostile threats towards it's body . Mara Corday is Sally , a mathematics genius and Mitch's love-interest who helps keep him centered and focused . The dialogue is full of delightfully dated and cornball ( . . terms like " we'll throw everything but the kitchen sink at ' im " or " Holy Toledo " or " I must've lost my marbles " ) , with much fun derived from the inner arguments between this civilian Mitch and the government assigned to find answers to a terrifying crisis where time is limited and martial law is declared as the giant killer bird causes nothing but problems with the public in cities or across the country . It swoops down to grab a moving locomotive train from it's tracks , lands upon the United Nations building , smashing it to smithereens . Falling debris has city folk running for their lives . The blasted alien buzzard even has an egg for which Mitch and Sally destroy . The film will cause much amusement as the characters carry on with grave expressions , many at each other's throats due to the crisis at hand . Good stuff . The puppet buzzard is a hoot . Many will find it rather embarrassing as I'm sure those who starred in this did , but I couldn't stop giggling at what the characters were forced to say , the cast attempting with dignity to bring an authenticity to such a rubbish , outrageous plot . Like in a lot of these B-movies , a dark , brooding narrative voice speaks about the job of our men and women , also foretelling danger regarding the monster in the sky .
Dracula-The Satanic Rites	I seem to be in the minority regarding this Dracula feature which I think is satirical in many ways . Think about it . . England's finest worshipping Satan , following the leadership of Count Dracula for ultimate mad power . The idea that Dracula has moved up the corporate ladder , a powerful businessman who has his own corporation , and a criminal organization planning to threaten global catastrophe by way of a newly created Bubonic plague . Lee even speaking Hungarian ( ! ) , obviously paying homage to Lugosi , using an alias , DD Dunham to carry out his underhanded dastardly deeds . Unlike other films , Dracula only bites one female victim in this one , threatening the life of Lorrimer Van Helsing's daughter ( . . this time played by stunning Joanna Lumley ) who are together working with detectives to infiltrate a den of vampires , led by Dracula . There's a great use of a hawthorn bush ( . . from such a bush was the crown of thorns placed on Christ's head which is why such a thing can inflict harm to the Devil's disciple ) to weaken Dracula . There's a place of Satan worship where Dracula's agents and disciples use for their amoral activities with a cellar containing his " brides . " You have Gibson's exciting camera-work , some nicely vicious stake-in-the-heart stabbings , and , while a bit dated , it's not a kooky as the previous Gibson vehicle , actually incorporating spy elements . . Dracula is kind of like a Bond villain with Cushing infiltrating his organization . Check it out if you would like to see a different type of Hammer Dracula movie . Includes a bit of nudity as a disciple of Dracula lays upon a table naked as kind of a sacrificial lamb as English political giants grin lasciviously at the idea of attaining global power and eternal life thanks to their new master . It seems Hammer fans resist Dracula in modern London , but , like the previous film Dracula AD 1972 , the vampire rarely circulates with society , using others to assist him in his activities . I think the office meeting between Lee and Cushing hearkens wonderfully back to Horror of Dracula and the we see a fabulous dissolve sequence at the end where a murdered vampire deteriorates before our eyes , from the flesh withering into bones , finally turning the remains into dust . To be honest , unlike others , I didn't mind the film not explaining how Dracula returns . I think , like previous films have shown , someone used blood or something to resurrect him . Look , films in the past came up with far-fetched , but imaginative , ways to bring him back to life and dispatch Dracula again , so not displaying his resurrection this time perhaps saves haters from rolling their eyes in disbelief .
The Forsaken	Prolific director JS Cardone ( Alien Hunter ; Shadowzone ; Outside Ozona ) brings us this profane Midwestern vampire tale with attitude starring Kerr Smith as , Sean , a young editor of trailers for a low-budget movie company who takes a car delivery job from Cali to Florida , but his journey is disrupted when he unfortunately picks up a hitchhiker , Nick ( Brendan Fehr ) who just so happens to hunt bloodsuckers . The head vampire , Kit ( Johnathon Schaech ) he's looking for is of a specific number called " The Forsaken " , a clan who accepted an offering from a demon and hence were cursed to only walk the earth at night . Sean and Nick come across a young woman , Megan ( Izabella Miko ) who has been bitten by Kit and is slowly going through the process of " turning " as the vampire who left the virus in her continues to live . While trying to cool her body ( . . Nick , who has been bitten and must also find a member of " The Forsaken " before he himself becomes one of the undead , notifies Sean that Megan's blood is " burning " so her body temperature must be cooled ) Megan bites Sean's hand leaving Kit's virus in him . So now Kit's death is of major importance because not only does Megan suffer as long as he remains alive , but Sean also is threatened to become a vampire . Nick , appropriately enough , encountered a doctor who had been bitten and was given knowledge of certain drugs which can slow down the process of turning into a vampire . But , the drugs can only last so long so finding Kit and exterminating the source of the blood disease is of utmost importance . But , Kit as his own brood , two female bloodsuckers and a dim-witted subservient day-driver ( Simon Rex ) , who travel with him so Sean and Nick , with Megan used as bait , will need to find holy ground for a legitimate stand-off . Ina Hamm ( Carrie Snodgress , rather wasted ) just so happens to live in the middle of nowhere with her house stands on top of a Spanish graveyard . . perhaps this is indeed the refuge they need as a base to fight Kit . The film doesn't pretend to be anything else but a horror tale of innocents plunged into a battle against a predator who holds the keys to their salvation . It's too bad this was made in 2001 because Cardone's trashy little vampire film would make perfect drive-in fodder . Schaech's presence as a charismatic and sexy male vampire really adds a great deal to this particular film as does Phina Oruche as his black sex slave Cym who attacks bloody throats with ferocity . Rex will earn chuckles as a rather simple-minded human watcher often saying " Okeydokey " when ordered by his boss to commit murderous deeds to those who threaten them . Particularly memorable is the murder of a cop who pulls Rex's Pen over for speeding , insists on seeing what was in their truck , receiving a shot-gun blast to the chest , and subsequently is burned alive on top of the hood of his police car . The attractive cast is headlined by Smith as the young hot-shot stud with a big bright future in the movie industry whose life is changed by a fateful drive into a most dangerous situation , and Izabella Miko as the doe-eyed innocent whose family was obliterated by the evil clan and bitten by Kit who must settle " unfinished business " when one of his vampire chicks didn't follow his command of killing her . Fehr was a bit too young , I felt , for the part of vampire hunter who knows an awful lot about the history of this breed of bloodsuckers . . I often wondered just how he received all this information . But , I guess Cardone was perhaps motivated by the studio to fill his cast with beautiful people so Fehr was selected . The opening of Cardone's film sure sets the tone of this flick , a zombie-like Miko showering the blood from her gorgeous naked body . She's later undressed by Nick attempting to find the vampire bite as Megan lies comatose from the virus raging inside her . Miko is either asleep or mute for a good portion of the film but Cardone utilizes her vulnerability , youth , and beauty quite well . . very photogenic . There's a very nifty image of Miko's Megan with her hands pressed up against the back window of Sean's car as they drive away from a scene which nearly killed them . This film isn't all that original and seems to evoke the spirit of " Near Dark " , but I thought Cardone uses the setting at night really well and there's a nasty streak this film has that worked for me . There are some unnecessary images propelled into the action from past scenarios which distracted me a bit , but certain gory bits are effective like how vampire bodies explode when in contact with sunlight too long , and a shot-gun blast to the face which does some serious damage . " The Forsaken " would probably make an appropriate double feature with John Carpenter's " Vampires . "
The Scarecrow reviews " Split Second "	The London of 2008 is buried under much water thanks to man's not fixing the global warming problem . Hauer plays a cop who is after a carnivorous creature who rips out the hearts of victims and eats them believing that it'll possess their souls . Hauer is linked to the creature for it sliced him across the arm after killing his partner . Hauer can sense when the creature is nearby as the viewer watches his agony ( not to mention we hear the thudding of heartbeats in the soundtrack ) . Duncan plays Hauer's partner , a young psychologist who is a college grad well studied in the understanding of psychopaths and their natures . The film also has a sub-ploy concerning Cattral , as Hauer's dead partner's wife who came to visit her late husband's grave stand . Hauer and Cattral had a thing at one time , but his alcoholism and decline in mental health ( the obsession in finding his partner's killer ) ended that partnership . Though , we see in their meeting ( Hauer came also to honor his best friend's tomb ) and the fire is rekindled . The creature is often hidden in darkness , with our point of view coming from the shooting of our characters . The camera often camouflages the creature through smoke and often placing the camera right on Hauer and company . The London we see has that cool neo-noir future . . wet , damp , and ugly . Hauer plays his cop half-crazed , and pretty unkempt . He drinks bad coffee , chain smokes cigars , and is quite profane . But , he's tough as nails and cagey . . a cop that isn't afraid to face the ugliness of evil and does so against the creature . The creature itself is basically a likeness to the essential HR Geiger design . It is about 10 ft tall , black , with a long head and nasty serpentine teeth . The violence is mostly is how we view the creature's aftermath . . bloody scenes of the crime where the victim's chest lays open and heart missing . Duncan is a hoot as the much more intelligent , green , and tidy partner who Hauer resists at offset , but accepts once he sees that creature himself . The film does nothing with Cattral who is simply in the film because she's very attractive .
Nightmare Sisters	Three sorority sisters from Tri Eta Pi , buckteeth , frazzle headed Melody ( Linnea Quigley ) , geeky Marci ( Brinke Stevens ) who often frequents flea markets for trinkets , and plump Mickey ( Michelle Bauer ) always in big clothes and snacking on whatever junk food is in sight , invite three dorks to a shindig of their own making . The three nerds are constantly abused by three jocks in their fraternity . The jocks threaten , through some made-up rule in a pledge book , to expel the nerds from the fraternity if they go to this party . But , the dorks sneak away anyway , and the jocks find out , hot in pursuit . Awakening a demonic spirit in a crystal ball Marci found at a flea market during a séance with the nerds , the three sisters are turned from geeky broads to delectable babes . There's a catch . . these babes are possessed by evil making them succubus yearning to bite young eager horny males in the crotch , turning them into ash , and removing their souls . Will the nerds be able to save their gals from the evil driving them ? Perhaps with the help of an expert in exorcism , found right in the phone book no less , they can . . Look , when I rented NIGHTMARE SISTERS I knew exactly what I was in for . . and I got what I expected . I rented it for titillation and tongue-in-cheek humor and got exactly that . I didn't really find the opening , where a fortune telling con-artist is looking into his crystal ball as a naive , rather dunderheaded ( . . quite wealthy ) widow falls for his theatrical antics regarding the summoning of her husband , that funny , but I chuckled quite a bit just at the three female leads in nerdy disguise . It was quite obvious that they were having a good time playing against type . The film is indeed a light-hearted romp , a sex comedy which delivers the nudity expected as Quigley , Stevens & Bauer give their male ( . . and perhaps , female ? ) audience what they pined for . The special highlight is their bath tub scene where all three partake in soaping and washing each other with glowing smiles . Once the gals become succubus , they practically remain top-less trying to seduce any male in close proximity . The film certainly shows it's low budget in the photography , sound , & choice few locations . A great deal of the picture takes place at the house of our sorority sisters . A demon monster , behind the possession of our unfortunate sorority sisters , shows up at the end , as Perrin ( Jim Culver ) the exorcist who wants time and a half working such late hours , goes to battle in a spiritual warfare for the ages .
The Legend of Bigfoot	Critically panned " in search of . . " Bigfoot faux documentary about an expert tracker / adventurer Ivan Marx , who feels deeply motivated to seek out " the missing link " throughout North America . When Marx captured evidence of what he claims was a Sasquatch , he was met with scrutiny and jeers from " experts " ( . . when Ivan says this word , it's richly conveyed in his voice his general loathing for those who consider themselves experts critical of his " evidence " of a photographed Bigfoot ) and this reaction would haunt him , driving the tracker to search endlessly for further truth no matter what dangers and inclement weather awaited him . The film is more of a document of Marx's journey to find Bigfoot and what he encounters along the way , such as the laws of nature , how the old ways are dying ( . . he is considered an old breed of what man once was , living off the land , remaining true and honest towards nature and the environment ) with modern civilization taking over ( progress ) , and how mankind effects nature in a negative way ( . . like their poaching , oil drilling , and lumber-jacking slowly destroying the environment and nature ) . While I realize and understand that many find Marx a bit pretentious in how he constantly reminds viewers of his talents , skills and capabilities as an everyman , I must admit that found " The Legend of Bigfoot " a rather pleasant experience . I think many aspects discussed as Ivan moves from location to the next ( . . he's quite the naturalist , giving us information of the areas he travels , the folklore and history of Eskimos , Native Americans , miners , and animals ) are truly fascinating and informative . Sure these are distractions from what we are hoping to see , general proof of a live Bigfoot specimen , but Ivan makes an account of what he encounters while hoping to find the creature always eluding him . I don't for a solitary minute believe those furry things we see are Bigfoot creatures ( . . and the sequence featuring lights in the distance of a Yukon valley are very unconvincing and rather awful ) , but I thought director Harry Winer and narrator / star Marx are good story-tellers , giving us a travelogue of the life and land of a tracker and his journeys . But , as other naysayers have pointed out , this is supposed to be about the Bigfoot , not nature and it's habits , hunting and mating rituals , so I must agree that this documentary isn't exactly focused on the specific subject of the title . But , I won't dismiss what the film does feature because even if this does belong on the National Geographic channel , I still found it an informative and worthwhile experience . Marx himself comes off a bit theatrical , and certainly praises his abilities throughout , but he's sincere about his subjects ( . . animals and nature ) and seems to know quite a bit about them . I will admit , however , that I have an affinity for films which photograph nature within various potential hostile environments and settings , and for Bigfoot as well ( . . no matter how imagined and created he is for our amusement , by those seeking to earn an extra buck ) . It's clear that " Legend of Bigfoot " attempts , woefully according to 99 % of those who have watched this , to ride the success of " The Legend of Boggy Creek " , since this features a narrator and a subject similar to that hit from director Pierce . Many will find this incredibly boring and misguided . I can only say I was entertained for the most part .
The Package	Complex , intelligent , but at times possibly implausible Cold War thriller with brass at the top of US government , General Hopkins ( Chelcie Ross ) and his second Col . Glen Whitacre ( John Heard ) , along with renegade Soviets , who have forged a plan to assassinate Soviet Press Secretary so that a Nuclear Arms Disarmament Treaty will be terminated between United States and the Soviet Union . They set up Sgt Gallagher ( Gene Hackman , who could play this kind of charismatic hero in his sleep ) to take the fall regarding the accidental release of a Walter Henke . In actuality , it isn't Walter but an expert sniper , Thomas Boyette ( Tommy Lee Jones ) taking his identity with the real man playing a patsy in Chicago supposedly running an operation against allowing Commies to come over here dictating policy . Unfortunately , Gallagher needs some info regarding the identity of Boyette ( he does go to the wife's home and realizes the " package " he was suppose to carry across to the US wasn't the man in his custody ; in a tragic turn of events some of Hopkins ' goons kill Walter's wife setting up Gallagher as the murderer ) and goes to his wife Eileen ( Joanna Cassidy ) who has recently made it up the ranks in the Army . In lending assistance , Eileen will be put in danger as evident by the murder of her confident Ruth ( Pam Grier ) who had the info she needed regarding Boyette . So Sgt . Johnny and ex-wife Eileen hit the road to Chicago to bust the assassination sting operation wide open with help by a Chicago cop named Lt . Milan ( Dennis Franz ) .
Nightmare	The vengeful spirit of Kyung-ah ( Ji-won Ha ) , a young woman who supposedly leaped from the balcony of a building to her death on top of a car's roof below , murders a group of friends , it seems , for no reason . Hye-jin ( Gyu-ri Kim ) was an unfortunate eye-witness to Kyung-ah's death from the street and finds that one of her friends , Seon-ae ( Jeong-yun Choi ) has returned from her stay in America . It's been two years since Kyung-ah's demise and Hye-jin is still burdened by troubling nightmares regarding her friend . Seon-ae claims that Kyung-ah follows her everywhere , tormenting her . Soon , a new friend enters Hye-jin's life , a mysterious young woman named Eun-ju . . but is this new relationship real or imagined because Eun-ju eerily resembles Kyung-ah . As her friends are found dead by grisly means , Hye-jin must question whether or not Seon-ae is the culprit or perhaps Kyung-ah herself . A major sub-plot concerns a hot-shot lawyer and his lover , both part of the group being slaughtered one at a time . What Hye-jin doesn't know is that her friends hide a horrifying secret which might explain the gruesome events transpiring . Despite being visually arresting ( I thought the camera-work was dazzling and the use of light effective ) , this film still utilizes the basic " ghostly revenge " supernatural slasher sub-plot . And , the ghostly haunts resemble the Asian horror hits populating the marketplace at the time , such as RINGU & JU-ON : THE GRUDGE . Still , there are enough unpleasant images and some nasty violence to keep one off-guard . There's an overhead shot of a victim lying in her bathtub bleeding as the shower rains upon her and one graphic attack on one male victim in a phone booth after his eye is gouged out . I thought " Nightmare " felt very reminiscent to I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER regarding how a secret kept within a small group leads to their being murdered . Slasher fans might just enjoy this one , but I don't think director Byeong-ki Ahn's film stands out from the pack of Asian horror flicks streaming today . Though , saying that , I do believe his visual eye is beneficial to the horror genre , as is cinematographer Seok-hyeon Lee . . they craft a good looking product here , even if the material feels rather deja vu .
Hack !	A class trip to an island turns into a nightmare as the college students hoping for a high grade to boost their GPA fall prey to their hosts , a married couple , obsessed film buffs , who record those they murder in ways associated with horror movies . This , at first , appears to be just another formula slasher . You have a check list of stereotypes that normally appear in slashers and can pretty much mark an X by the characters who will die as the film continues . But , what sets it apart from the fray of the usual is the wicked sense of humor , expert casting of genre veterans , and some perverse acts by a bizarre couple of psychos . But , also important is that HACK ! actually plays against norm in that a guy actually is the one at the end fleeing from killers . And , a specific twist regarding a third ( . . and possibly fourth ) party perhaps involved with the psychotic duo certainly adds to the terror for our hero , Jay Kenneth Johnson ( . . as the hunk Johnny ) as he must find a way out a very sticky situation as his friends are dead and his options of escape are limited . Danica McKellar ( . . the cutie from Wonder Years ) is " nerded " up as the unflappable , scholarly Emily , but we all know that a pair of glasses and braided hair can not mask the babe underneath the disguise . Emily is google-eyed for Johnny , who , in a change of pace for a slasher film , actually takes up for her when fellow classmates poke fun at her supposed dorky nature . . yet , Johnny is still able to gain rapport with his fellow students because he's just a cool dude . The rest of cast are merely supplying cultural stereotypes bound for violent death . . a dumb , impolite jock quarterback needing a high grade to make his football team , a sexpot , a foul-mouthed , weed-smoking skank , an Asian homosexual whose sexual orientation is the butt of many jokes and gags , and the token black character who supplies the pot , talks ghetto and is always trying to dial up someone on his cellphone that doesn't work ( . . imagine that ) . Most of these characters service the film as victims running through the island woods as the predators give chase . There's a dungeon the loonies have , a chamber of horrors where destroyed victims , grisly corpses , are used as set-pieces for memorable images in movies like Hellraiser & Texas Chainsaw Massacre , and one captured character is held in a large bird cage over a piranha-infested water hole ! Surprising number of recognizable faces pop up in minor parts such as Kane Hodder ( . . as the opening victim trying to escape from his pursuers ) , Burt Young ( . . as a crusty boat captain who takes the crew to the island ) , Tony Burton ( . . as nervous Sheriff Stoker , who worries that something dire has happened to the kids when they don't return ; he has a scene with ROCKY co-star Burt Young which might bring a grin to fans ' faces ) , William Forsythe ( . . as a gruff Irish island fisherman who attempts to save the day , and has some memorable exchanges with the psychos ) , and Lochlyn Munro ( . . as Burton's moronic deputy ) . Lots of in-jokes such as the names of the crazies , Vincent King ( Sean Kanan , whose chiseled features and clean-cut looks adds a unique dimension to his nutcase ) and Mary Shelley ( Juliet Landau ; who's always obviously a bit weird , her camera by her side at all times ready to record even the most mundane occurrences for a " new movie " ) . Even the professor , who is to chaperon the students , is named Mr . Argento ( . . nice ! ) . There also an abundance of references to horror classics and iconic characters popping up in the dialogue . This is made by filmmakers who love the genre and try to express that in as many ways as possible . The violence derives from an ax , hand gun ( . . rarely a weapon used in horror ) shot gun ( . . makes a real bloody mess of a victim's skull ) , thrown loose brick , a well ( . . the homage to The Grudge is quite an eye-opener ) , clown's hammer ( ! ) , chainsaw , and a spinning saw blade ( . . decapitating a bound person's leg as he screams in horror ) . A thrown saw blade decapitates a victim whose leaning up against a tree . Lots of gore and viscera . Gabrielle Richens as Sylvia , a foreign exchange student lusting for the quarterback , is quite a looker . Once McKellar is able to shed her geeky disguise . . yummy . Slasher fans might embrace this one . . it's dark heart is in the right place .
Below	The attack on a supposed German sub tender and mysterious death of Captain Winters plague the USS Tiger Shark submarine crew in Atlantic Ocean waters . While trying to return home , the submarine picks up three survivors of an attack on the British Fort James Hospital Ship , while also facing the possible dangers of a German ship which attempt to blast them with depth charges while underwater . But , the German ship is the least of their worries as the film chronicles the hauntings and various mechanical failures the crew faces while some supernatural force is " willing / guiding " the submarine to the location of a past incident where Winters died under rather shady circumstances . Submarine spook film from Twohy , the director of PITCH BLACK . Good number of familiar faces populate the cast including Bruce Greenwood as Captain Brice , an officer who seems , at first , to guide the crew well , handling the command rather effectively , until the hauntings begin . . his unraveling is one of many interesting things that occur in this film . There are some effective hauntings for fans of ghost stories , with some ominous tapping noises that give the crew the creeps , and a most eerie scene when four men reluctantly go outside the sub to repair an oil leak . The conspiracy aspect of the film ( four men know what happened to Winters and why he's dead ) builds as time goes and Winters " seeks his revenge " with the mystery playing out as Olivia Williams ' medical nurse Claire ( . . one of the three survivors from Fort James ) plays snoop , and is used as our guide into the revelations . Matthew Davis is the green , but trustworthy and intelligent , Odell whose on his first big sub mission with Holt McCallany his superior Loomis , often scolding him ( . . or rubbing his face in being a rookie officer with limited experience ) . Loomis , as well as officer Lieutenant Coors ( Scott Foley ) , also know exactly what transpired that fateful night Winters perished . There's an important sequence ( . . the hull leak I mentioned above regarding the oil leak ) where Coors appears on the verge of possibly harming Odell , for he's been curious as to what truly happened to Winters . There's other major sequences in the film , such as a hydrogen disaster that wipes out a good portion of the crew who are burned alive ; nifty climax as the remaining members left , losing oxygen , with the sub slowly growing colder and only flashlights guiding their way in the dark . As in numerous submarine flicks , we get to see the operations of a crew at work and the filmmakers take the opportunity to exploit the claustrophobic confines of such working conditions with the oft-used " walk-through " following an officer spreading the word about survivors picked up ( . . including a woman ) . I was pleasantly surprised as to the polished camera-work and overall production . . the movie looks great , like a million bucks . To be honest , though , the film plays out with a mystery that doesn't exactly surprise . . for the most part , I think viewers can read between the lines and guess how everything will pan out , with predictability being the film's main enemy . Still , the cast is game and the film has enough action with spooks to keep one's attention .
Hellraiser : Hellseeker	As the film opens Trevor ( Dean Winters ) and his wife Kirsty ( Ashley Laurence in a most welcome return to the Hellraiser franchise even if just for a supporting role ) are speaking of getting their marriage back on track when a vehicle nearly hits them with their car going over a bridge and into the river below . Trevor frees himself from the seat belt and car , but Kirsty is unable to escape with the result being drowning . Once Trevor awakens in a hospital , his life . . his reality . . becomes a living nightmare as nothing is what it seems as memories regarding the past before waking up slowly return with the accompaniment of devastating migraine headaches which worsen as time goes by . Detective Lange ( William S Taylor ) informs Trevor that his wife was never found and that the car doors , that were supposed to be locked when he tried to free Kirsty from the vehicle , were open . As memories become available , Trevor realizes that he might not be the doe-eyed innocent he thought he was . . his aggressive female boss brings up a possible past of rough sex , he just might've had a tryst with a female neighbor , worked out a possible partnership with a fellow employee in murdering his wife for her inheritance , and actually purchased the puzzle-box from a creepy seller . As the film continues , Trevor sees disturbing images of outrageous violence and relives sexual experiences with the possible females he committed adultery with behind Kirsty's back . Most importantly , Pinhead . . and his cenobite footmen . . appear to him at times opening up the possibility that Trevor is in for true horror . What is happening to Trevor ? Where is Kirsty's body ? Why is Pinhead emerging in Trevor's " reality " ? Like the last sequel " Inferno " , this film works as a developing mystery with ghastly occurrences frequently hitting the protagonist from all sides . And , we find that perhaps Trevor isn't this heroic angel , but someone quite corrupt even if he doesn't know it . If you haven't seen it and are curious , yes Kirsty and Pinhead face each other . . BUT , it might not be the kind of meeting you'd expect . Trevor plays a heavy hand in their meeting and we see that , despite Pinhead's much minor role in this film , he has his hand in the grand scheme of things just as he did in " Inferno " . I thought this little sequel was fun . It does supply the gore one expects from the HELLRAISER franchise , but delivers quite an unsettling story that develops along nicely . . well , for me at least . I know quite a few who hate it , but I have to say I dug it .
It's a Miserable Life	Freddy becomes more of a host into the nightmares of the characters instead of a major player in them in this second episode . Bryan ( John Cameron Mitchell , the director of SHORTBUS & HEDWIG ) is a young man stuck at a hamburger joint whose father is the owner . He wishes to leave Springwood for a college despite his father's request towards him taking over the family business eventually . He wants to make something of his life , however , and the whole idea of being stuck in the environs of a hamburger joint forever seem horrifying . This comes into play when he is supposedly shot by a psychotic , ominous motorcyclist in the forehead . He has nightmarish visions dealing with his parents who seem to behave anything but rational . He also continues to bleed from his forehead despite no signs of a wound . He still sees the shooter from time - to-time and Karen ( Lar Park-Lincoln ) even shows up now and then seemingly his only ally . But , is he destined to remain in the atmosphere of the grease-spoon or can he escape the never ending hell of the confines of Springwood ? The other victim of the motorcycle sicko is Karen , Brian's girlfriend , coming to meet up with him . She is taken to a hospital where the conditions and staff are anything but normal . This hospital is in many ways disorienting as the nightmares plaguing Brian and it seems Karen can not escape . Karen , like Brian , continues to see the killer while also experiencing bizarre treatment from the doctors and nurses attending to her . Okay combination of stories tries to be morbidly compelling and quirky . I thought the second story featuring Lincoln ( better known to horror fans of the Friday THE 13TH series as the telekinetic arch-nemesis of Jason Voorhies in the seventh film , THE NEW BLOOD ) in the hospital was the more entertaining because of the unusual methods of the staff working on her . They tend to do disturbing things while she lays helpless in horror . Mitchell being in this might be an interesting curio for fans of his highly popular HEDWIG AND THE ANGRY INCH . His is the one geared more towards comedy with how weird his parents behave and the play on his never escaping the dead-in job of flipping burgers . Since the budget is low , the director had to be creative with the effects he had , but Tom McLoughlin ( the man who helmed Friday THE 13TH : JASON LIVES ) aims more for bizarre imagery and black humor .
Cabin by the Lake	A horror screenplay writer , Stanley Kaldwell ( Judd Nelson , perfectly cast ) , works on his scripts in a cabin near a lake on the outskirts of Los Angeles , actually committing the murders authored for films ! While a series of these murders are indeed successful ( . . he kidnaps the girls , placing them in a van , using the barking sounds of dogs recorded on a cassette to lure them closer , latches their foot to a chain locked in the center bolt of a basement room with a sink and mattress , with a wall and marker available to address your feelings to the captor , receiving food , before being blindfolded , curried by boat to a place in the middle of the lake , chained to a stone weight , and dropped into the water to drown , finally , after death , taken to a properly prepared underwater garden ) , a final female victim , Mallory ( Hedy Burress ) , selected because of a phobia towards water , is rescued thanks to underwater divers , two special effects artists testing equipment and a deputy , Boone ( Michael Weatherly ) helping them . Mallory knows his face , is quite a tough , less intimidated adversary , and agrees to assist Boone and the effects technicians which work at the lake in a workshop to capture the killer / kidnapper on a camera hidden behind the eye of a prosthetic likeness of herself , planted underwater where she was spotted . . but the plan is less than successful due to Stanley's finding their camera and escaping their clutches as police couldn't secure his location in time . Even worse , Stanley kidnaps Mallory a second time , from her hotel room , returning the poor girl to his hidden lair where she was the first time ! Can she escape certain doom a second time or will Boone be able to save her from Stanley who has special plans for his nagging agent as well ? Not a graphically violent thriller , but featuring rather disturbing , macabre subject matter , directed with tongue firmly in cheek . You couldn't choose a better candidate for a cold and calculating psychopath than Judd Nelson who is completely able to provide that icy detached black void of humanity as he pushes victims into the water without flinching . Nelson's eyes express a chilling darkness , and he's suitably able to convey a dark soul , who is clever and cunning . The film's sick humor derives from the fact that a film's screenplay writer is an actual killer who acts out the material , using the victims themselves as inspiration . The underwater garden is really a twisted visual image , the way he goes about tending to the bodies of the girls he murdered . . all part of the work , and it's authenticity . Also , the filmmakers take shots at how the production process strips away a writer's integrity by altering his work , as his agent and director often make suggestions and lament about what's wrong with the screenplay . . their fates after confronting Nelson at his cabin was probably a fantasy many writers for movies have had over the years . Again , the violence is tame , it's the process with which Stanley operates that produces impact . Far fetched fate of Nelson at the end is a liability because it removed realism from the movie .
Mosquito	Thanks to the alien dead , mosquitoes grow to alarming sizes , with an insatiable blood-thirst that puts any human being in their path in danger . A park is threatened as the swarm of mosquitoes , whose droning can be heard afar off , head straight towards them . Wiping out campers , who had pitched tents or were out fishing , a motley group of survivors , a meteorologist , Parks ( Steve Dixon ) notices strange readings on his Geiger counter and soon meets a couple , Megan ( Rachel Loiselle ) soon to be a park ranger and her lame boyfriend Ray ( Tim Lovelace , handed a lot of goofy one-liners which only add to the fun ) as they soon encounter the camping grounds covered in shriveled corpses , their blood drained dry . Hiding underneath a boat is cowardly Hendricks ( Ron Asheton ) who informs the group of what caused the slaughter . The four of them , take a RV from a deceased victim , hitting the road where they come across a duo of bumbling criminals , having lost a third member to the mosquitoes . Bankrobber Earl ( Gunnar Hansen , Leatherface of Hooper's TCM ) , a grumbling , not-so-pleasant sort , and his inept brother Junior wish to commandeer the group's RV escalating into a brawl which soon has them all working as a collective when the mosquitoes attack the vehicle as Parks drives down the road . The film follows the group as the mosquitoes lead them to an abandoned farmhouse with special guests whose " epi-center " is in the basement . Look , I knew exactly what I was getting myself into . I clearly expected this to be a 90's variant on the " giant insect " creature features from the 50's and was pleased with the result . There's a charm , to be sure , with a film of non-names and mosquitoes which often look like puppets guided by handlers with sticks just off-screen . The farm house stand-off , which I felt was a homage to Romero's NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD , is particularly a treat where Hansen has an inspired moment with a certain log-cutting tool that sounds off as it rips apart constructed mosquitoes . There's a ton of emphasis on acting , but I didn't think the cast was nowhere near as horrendous as others . If anything , they were a likable , spirited brood I could easily root for . But , I can't , for the life of me , help but wonder what viewers expect when they start up a movie like this . . you didn't know this was about giant created mosquitoes , made with quite a less-than-thrilling budget , attacking an unknown cast ( . . only a low budget and a title like " Mosquito " could afford ) ? I think , if anything , there's a joy and enthusiasm quite present as the film plays out , with some good and mediocre effects of the mosquitoes . I thought the director kept a solid pace , and the plot is what it is , and there's not a lick of pretension , which I especially found rewarding . I enjoyed how the mosquitoes would thrust into the bodies of victims with their proboscis , draining the blood and how they exploded when fired upon by guns while in flight . The house explosion at the end left me quite amused , particularly with how a central character cheats death thanks in part to a refrigerator . I also felt that what lies within the basement was a homage , of sorts , to ALIEN . There is plenty of silly dialogue , delivered straightly , that works beautifully within the hokey confines of this film . My favorite scene actually doesn't have the mosquitoes in it at all . . our heroic meteorologist finds a camp site riddled with corpses left in the wake of a mosquito attack .
Feast	Basic monster massacre creature feature has a group of unfortunates trapped in a beer joint as feasters await outside ready to strike ferociously . Character development isn't an issue here to be bothered with for these victims are merely clichés ( every character has their own title card for pete-sake ) to be slaughtered at random in various gruesome ways . Absurd humorous flourishes abound ( monster sex , Clu Galagher sporting a long earring ; the hero dying immediately after introducing himself ; Henry Rollins as a motivational speaker { ! } ) assist a tad bit , but it's still your typical bloody mess of people being dispatched . Do we who venture into a viewing of a monster film like this expect anything otherwise , though ? Balthazar Getty plays a prick who gets to be hero of the day while hottie Krista Allen is the unlikely heroine whose son becomes swallowed lunch in one long gulp . Notable for being the third Project Greenlight production with Wes Craven assisting the team as a guiding teacher . Outrageous to the extreme with the use of the new breed of Hollywood film-making consisting of hyperkinetic camera-work / editing and exhausting breakneck pace . You have a hard time catching your breath as those beasties can move some kind of fast ( with those razor-sharp teeth and claws that take off limbs and penetrate torsos in quite a hurry ) .
Do You Like Hitchcock ?	A young film student named Giulio ( Elio Germano ) , with a classic unhinged case of " peeping tom " disease , believes a woman named Sasha ( Elisabetta Rocchetti ) that he spies on from across the street may've formed a " Strangers on a Train " partnership with another young woman , Federica ( Chiara Conti ) . His belief only heightens when Sasha's overbearing ( . . but wealthy ! ! white flag , maybe ? ) mother is viciously murdered . His increased desire to find out if what he believes is true , Giulio will inevitably face possible harm or worse death . Yet , he continues on to find a killer . . Marginal Argento effort doesn't come anywhere near his greater gialli , and is surprisingly predictable . It's underwhelmingly non-violent ( only one death , believe it or not ) , and has very little in the way of thrills . It does have some nudity and Argento's camera longingly strokes their flesh , but it is more to do with Giulio's lifestyle and obsession for spying on them . That may be one of a few true characterizations of Giulio for he pretty much spies on someone the entire picture and is lucky to escape several near moments of real danger ( . . even as a child , as Argento opens the film , he narrowly escapes spying on two older women slicing a bird ) . The homage to Hitchcock is a wonderful reason to watch the film and Argento also has moments of praise for Fritz Lang , David Lynch , & " Nosferatu . " He often shows Giulio visiting a video store so that is kind of cool to see Argento even given himself the treatment ( check out the poster of his recent " The Card Player " ) , and has him researching several films . You always feel , though , that Hitchcock is to be praised in this film and " Rear Window " especially gets a lot of love . If you want Argento with bite . . look elsewhere . This is an uninspired thriller which does have good pacing even if the ending is lackluster .
Freeze Me	Some kinda warped film from Takashi Ishii which represents female retaliation at it's strangest . Chihiro ( Harumi Inoue ) has made a warm existence for herself since being horribly raped by three thugs five years prior , including her own Childhood friend , Hirokawa ( Kazuki Kitamura ) . She has a promising future with Nogami ( Shunsuke Matsuoka ) and works with him . But , Chihiro's life will swing into an unexpected nightmare when Hirokawa finds her and brutalizes her both physically and mentally . He tells her the other two , Baba ( Naoto Takenaka , a formidable presence that is quite scary ) & Kojima ( Shingo Tsurumi ) are wanting to re-unite with Chihiro as well . One by one will damage her in one way or another and each will pay the price for their sins because through all the mistreatment creates a monster . Chihiro's comfortable life that was changes when Nogami finds out about Hirokawa and her past rape . She will descend slowly into madness as the awful circumstances shape her into a cold-blooded killer . . and then some . The film's main power derives from how she treats those three after exacting revenge for their wrong-doing towards her . Potent , haunting , and unrelenting . In a sense , the film holds a grip on you as you wonder how anyone could ever survive from what Chihiro is put through . She's certainly put through the ringer as Chihiro is pretty much assaulted in every imaginable way . . her very humanity taken away as she is forced into difficult positions by cruel men with only one thing in mind . The title provides us with an irony that's all too tragic . One thing Takashi Ishii doesn't do is submerge us into the horrible details of what happens to her . He does it through smoke and mirrors setting the camera up in proper places where we get a general idea of what is taking place without rubbing our nose in it . No doubt , Ishii cares for this character and the tragedy leaves a sadness despite Chihiro getting her retribution .
Unrest-Formaldehyde & Death	" You disrespect the body . . you enrage the soul . " Alison Blanchard ( Corri English , who is quite a hottie ) is an agnostic first-year in " Gross Anatomy " who " senses " a presence that is not quite right when her student group of four lift open the sheet over the body of a Brazilian woman ( . . the woman we see in the opening cutting herself with a piece of broken glass from her mirror ) . She almost immediately breaks the cardinal rule of the profession regarding examining the body for cause of death . . don't personalize the body . She begins to search for clues regarding the corpse's identity and soon anyone who has come in direct contact with the mysterious dead woman winds up dead in various gruesome ways ( . . but most victims wind up in " the tank " , a specific tank for storing certain bodies no longer in use ) . Along with her new lover / anatomy partner Brian ( Scot Davis ) , Alison will find out various unusual things such as the woman's being a archaeologist with the major find of an Aztek burial ground of over 5 , 000 bodies sacrificed for the God Tlazolteotl , the god of fertility ( . . and prostitution ) . Also , her lab partner Carlos ( Joshua Alba ) digs up certain tapes containing recordings of this woman's changes in human condition as she descended into pregnancy and prostitution actually sacrificing her own unborn child . Told by her psychiatrist that " corporeal manifestations " don't exist , Alison will still remain on her dogged pursuit to end the madness by destroying the body for which might put the soul at rest and end the bloodshed . Okay , the wacky premise might not suit you because it is about some restless spirit essentially wiping out those who touched her corpse . Why Alison is allowed to live longer than others is anyone's guess , but she is the heroine so that's how screenplays work . Obviously Brian is her love-interest so he's perhaps saved by the screenplay as well . I know some have complained about the performances but I thought English was fine in the lead . . it's quite a crazy situation so I do expect anyone in her spot to react with all sorts of emotion . I question her judgment , but she's effected by the dead woman so irrational behavior does seem . . umm . rational in this case . My beef is more towards the investigations regarding the case of several dead murdered bodies and how a lab could continue to run ( . . and how Alison would ever be able to continue working in the lab after her various illegal acts such as the retrieval of a photograph considered off-limits , or her prying into the anatomy room tank ) . It's built for entertainment only and takes leaps in logic , but at least it's original , eh ?
The Ghost of Yotsuya Part II	Picking up where the story left off in part 1 , Lemon Tamiya and Naosuke coerce Tukuetsu , the masseur , into helping them get rid of the dead bodies of Oiwa and Kohei . As planned , Tamiya marries Oume and Naosuke seeks blackmailing profit . But , we witness the perfect crime fall apart thanks to Yomoshichi and Osode's search for Oiwa while Kohei's mother yearns to find her son , with a troubling feeling that he's dead . Also escalating is Tamiya's guilt and madness , plagued by hallucinations and nightmares of the image of Oiwa , eventually frightening Oume for whom he believes she is at times . Meanwhile , Naosuke becomes a major nuisance , demanding money from Tamiya , mistreating Omaki who he used to gain influence within the Ichimonji-ya family , and threatening Osode & Yomoshichi to put aside their investigation into a potential murder of Oiwa . Tukuetsu doesn't make Naosuke's life any easier , asking for " hush money " thanks to concealing his knowledge regarding the whereabouts of Kohei and Oiwa . . the elder masseur doesn't know what evil intent Naosuke has in store for him . Also developing is an ex-husband of Omaki looking for Naosuke for his involvement in the interruption of the jailbreak . Lots going on in this close to the two-part melodrama about the repercussions of murder for personal gain . Those involved must answer for their misdeeds and , unfortunately for Tamiya , he will realize Naosuke's treachery , not to mention , face the horrors of his own transgressions , his errors psychologically manifesting , endangering those women who even remotely resemble Oiwa . Director Keisuke Kinoshita's style is certainly crude , at times , but he establishes some impressive set-pieces such as the fiery Inchimonji-ya family's estate in the climax as Tamiya chases after Oume , and eventually Naosuke , as a giant inferno erupts . The camera work can be a bit sloppy and certain scenes could've been set up more effectively ( . . some chases , consisting of Naosuke either attempting to kill someone , or avoiding a foe coming toward him with a sword , are pulled back so far you can barely see the action ) , but I felt that Japanese film-making in it's early stages was just developing and can accept that the process was evolving . . certain inadequacies were bound to emerge as filmmakers grew familiar with the medium . But , the story itself I found gripping even though I expected the outcome because crime doesn't pay and those who participate in such an act must suffer persecution for their involvement . Deceptively classified as horror , but THE GHOST OF YOTSUYA PART II is more of a morality tale without the single use of a ghost ( . . in the literal sense ) at all . That was indeed disappointing because I was expecting to see Tamiya tormented by Oiwa's ghost , and instead he was tortured by the manifestations of his own psyche ( . . you rarely see Oiwa's face , just Tamiya's terrified expressions ) .
Maléfique	This film centers on four criminals , locked away in a prison who desire escape from their cell , hoping that a mysterious book of black magic , penned by a former inmate around 1920 , named Danvers who wanted to use spells to keep his skin young . Carrère's ( Gérald Laroche ) criminal business tactics ( shortcuts ) have landed him in prison with three oddball cell-mates . . a transsexual brute Marcus ( Clovis Cornillac ) , Marcus ' love-toy Pâquerette ( Dimitri Rataud ) who eats objects he touches ( . . and is in prison for eating his six-month old sister ) and obeys his charge as if " he " were his mother , and the scholarly Lassalle ( Philippe Laudenbach ) who doesn't read , or eat breakfast ( . . the latter being that he murdered his wife during that time of the day ) . The film follows Carrère as he reads from the book , attempting to understand it's meanings hoping to find an exit from his prison . Carrère loves his child , and for a while believes his wife will get him out early on bail . When she betrays him , Carrère begins to slowly seethe with hate , and longing to see and hold his beloved son . Carrère's toughest critic is Marcus , who longs to be fully female , while still folding to several masculine traits , such as working out and taking a leak standing up . He talks tough and uses his muscle as a type of fear tactic , although deep inside is a world of vulnerability . Pâquerette is completely under Marcus ' control and behaves like a canine to it's master . . there's even an alarming scene where Pâquerette breast-feeds from Marcus ! Lassalle is an unraveling mystery , opening up for us to slowly understand his ulterior motives and what lies within his possibly sinister brain . Clearly intellectual , and holding possible secrets from the others , Lassalle is actually the one who keeps the motivation of pursuing the secrets of the book going . Soon , those who aren't a threat to the book seek their " true " escape , not as much from the cell of four walls , but the cell that imprisons their true desires . After a certain murder , the book is thrown from the room with a very fascinating character entering the film with a camcorder as if he were a new occupant . . who is this person and how does he understand the power of a book tosses away , and better yet , how to use it ? A constant in this film is each of the prisoners often seen throughout looking out their window into the world just out of reach . I'm glad I had a chance to watch this film . It does play out like " Monkey's Paw " , the characters get what they desire , but a price must be met . There's gore in the film , startling moments of graphic violence , but , in my opinion , this is first and foremost a story-driven tale . The gore is a product of what the book unleashes . One of the group gets his limbs twisted while suspended in the air , while a grisly opening act displays the carnage left in the wake of one man's desire . We see Danver's fate at the end , with a magnificent special effects sequence regarding an infant melting away . Lassalle's fate is a masterful effects sequence . I will say that Maléfique , through Eric Valette's well paced direction , always kept my attention , and , for being such an isolated movie ( . . about 95 % of the film takes place in a singular location , the prison cell ) it never seems to drag . I guess that's a testament to interesting actors and fascinating characterizations , not to mention a compelling story using the supernatural to drive them .
Vampyr	Journeyman Allan Grey , a morbid fellow , with special interests in the occult such as devil worship and vampirism , finds himself in a place eerily similar in tone to the supernaturally evil subjects he studies . . a creepy inn nearby a castle housing a family haunted by a vampire and a sinister doctor who could be doing it's bidding . While , the film does indeed have a story , master director Dreyer is clearly more interested in building an atmosphere with weird goings-on where shadows live and breathe and our gloomy hero becomes a part of a plot by a vampire to take over an innocent family using a doctor and his accomplice as slaves for it's bidding . The film contains shadows dancing , a man's shadow moving on it's own , Allan's " out-of-body " spirit witnessing the doctor and his accomplice closing a casket containing his body ( . . with Dreyer shooting Allan within the coffin , through Allan's eyes looking out the coffin window , and Allan's dead face from behind the coffin glass ; each image is quite spooky and effective ) , the Lord of the Manor , whose home Allan finds himself , shot by a shadowy figure's rifle , a skeletal hand with a bottle of poison appearing in Allan's dream among other sequences providing the viewer with lots to remember . I thought it was a bit slow-moving and methodical , certainly a product of cinema just releasing as sound was being introduced on the outskirts of silent film . An odd collection of characters with very interesting faces . Dreyer's camera moves as methodically as his film's pace . Certainly an interesting companion with something like Murnau's Nosferatu which would make an ideal double feature . Great dissolve from corpse face to skull after a vampire is staked through the heart . Ideal location for filming such a Gothic horror tale with the low-quality transfer actually surprisingly enhancing the experience , for me at least . Thankfully , I watched this on Turner Classics in about as pristine a form as I could ever expect . Really , the film feels and looks like a silent picture and really doesn't need any sound at all . All you'd need are title cards and music and it'd be an ideal silent film . Seems to feature heavily religious undertones where the power of evil can overtake the good unless instructions are followed properly through the use of a guide provided to Allan by the Lord of the Manor , who left orders for the " vampire book " to be read after his death .
Eraser	Bottom line : This is a preposterous , ridiculous , and absolutely unrealistic action film . Bottom line : It's VERY , VERY entertaining action film which never lets you catch a breath . If you try and read the realism of an action film which has Arnold just dodge a damaged wing propeller of an airplane , will himself to a falling parachute pack , shoot out the windshield of said airplane while it is flying towards him , dodge hitting the plane again as it drifts away when bullets blow holes and intense air into the pilots ' face , get his parachute all tangled around his legs , unwind the tangled parachute , loose that parachute , but unearth the emergency parachute , and finally land on a junkyard car bending the entire top , yet barely bat an eyelash . Okay , have I made that pretty clear . The film takes . . umm . . liberties with the limits of what one man is able to do . Arnold Schwarzenegger plays US Marshal John Kruger . . a man who " erases " the identities of people under the special witness program . We see his impressive work early as he rescues Johnny Castelone ( Robert Pastorelli , who is very funny ) and his wife from certain death at the hands of gangsters working for a mob boss he plan to squeal on . We watch him defuse the situation rather easily . He's good at his job and shows that this kind of operation , if placed in the trustworthy hands of Kruger , that a person can escape possible doom . He receives a new person to relocate . . Lee Cullen ( the always beautiful Vanessa Williams ) , a woman who uncovers the plans of her company , Cyrez , in the possible sell of military hi-tech weaponry ) . Kruger's boss , Chief Beller ( James Coburn ) , informs him that there are some high-level people that will be effected greatly by Lee's witnessing at a trial in regards to her Defense Corporation , Cyrez . We soon discover that even the Undersecretary of Defense Daniel Harper ( Andy Romano ) is a major player in arms selling . But , nothing would prepare Kruger for the ultimate betrayal of his mentor , US Marshal Robert Deguerin ( James Caan ) , who is behind the works of getting the operation all set up and balanced without complications . Deguerin , unfortunately , isn't able to finish off Kruger in the plane ( he needed him to guide them to Lee ) and creates some real trouble to his almost too smooth plans in setting up the selling of a major load of state-of-the-art , electromagnetic rifles for $52 million . The problem Kruger faces is not only keeping Lee alive but convincing Beller that Deguerin is the mole of WITSEC ( the official name of the witness protection program Kruger works for ) . The film shows countless scenarios where by all true rights , Kruger would never make it out alive . Every time the screenplay stacks the deck , Kruger superhumanly brings himself out safely . The film provides some real humdingers in the way of complications . . there is an unlimited supply of dead meat for Deguerin to send into the grinder to kill Kruger . Check out the most famous scene , in the zoo sequence where Kruger shoots out the alligator tank and these reptiles eat several men trying to kill them . In a ball-busting escape from an alligator , Kruger shoots it in the mouth and proclaims , " You're luggage . " The film has lots of fast-moving chases where we ponder momentarily how Kruger and Lee will ever accomplish their mountainous goals of taking down the evil corruption of those willing to sell weaponry to a dangerous terrorist . I liked how Kruger uses Castelone to get into the Cyrez building to access information about what is on the disc that she copied at the beginning of the film that got her into such trouble to start with . I thought the entire sequence was unbelievable , but so is the rest of the film so why quarrel with such things . Ultimately , the film is a cat-and-mouse between teacher and student . Kruger has to find ways to outsmart the man that taught him all the ways of being an Eraser . So it's up to the two of them in understanding how each others ' mind works to determine how thee whole difficult situation will be played out . The film is never boring , always on the run with few chances to unleash those horrible moments of characterization . All we need is the non-stop , jaw dropping , exhausting action to keep out heads from towering over in sleepy slumber . This delivers , though , what it sets out for . . it is a blast to watch even if you don't believe a bit of it .
The Scarecrow reviews " The Desperadoes "	This is simply a good ole fashioned western . . not overly complex or long . It doesn't deceive itself in thinking that it was made but for entertainment . Still , it is one of those westerns you can watch once and be done with without returning . It features former partners Randolph Scott and Glenn Ford whose friendship is strong despite the fact that Ford's Cheyenne Rogers has been part of bank robbing ( he even steals Scott's Sheriff Steve Upton's horse without knowing it his good friend for which he is thieving ) . In Red valley , Upton is under heavy scrutiny for a bank robbing that ended with several dead . Claire Trvor portrays Countess Maletta , a friend of Cheyenne's who gives he and buddy " Nitro " ( Guinn ' Big Boy ' Williams ) a place to stay for the time being . Cheyenne desires to go straight , but finds that hard when Jack Lester ( Bernard Nedell ) and his bad bunch want to rob Red Valley's bank . It is actually Jack who is behind the murders , but Cheyenne's troubled past is hard to get away from . He and Nitro will be charged with the murders they didn't commit ( the robbery was one Cheyenne didn't commit ) and it will be Upton who must somehow save the day before Lester gets away with murder . There are sub-plots which include Cheyenne's falling in love with Alison McLeod { Evelyn Keyes ; the irony of the story is that Alison's father , Uncle Willie , is actually in cahoots with Banker Stanley Clanton ( Porter Hall ) in a planned united theft with Lester to steal the town of Red Valley's loot } . Will Upton uncover Uncle Willie and Banker Clanton's treacherous scheme ? Will Uncle Willie be able to go through it without his conscience always bothering him ? This film has a terrific barroom brawl and a dandy of a climactic shootout . Columbia couldn't have picked a better genre to begin the coloring process as this film has some fine mountainous shots as men give chase on horseback and such . Don't expect to get your socks blown off , but the film is simple and well paced .
The Shadow	The Shadow ( Alec Baldwyn ) , that great crime-fighter based on the popular radio serials , must contend with Shiwan Khan ( John Lone ) . . an old acquaintance who wishes to - - yep , you guessed it - - rule the world ! Scientist Dr . Reinhardt Lane ( Ian McKellen , surprisingly quite hammy ) has almost put together a major atomic bomb for the government's war department , but a specific component must be used for it to be fully operational . This bomb is Khan's ticket at complete rule so he will enlist Lane's assistant Farley Claymore ( Tim Curry , chewing the scenery as always ) who is only happy to be a partner that might see him as a King over a world at their feet . Khan has the ability , much like The Shadow , to control weak-minded individuals , and through that will become a successful nemesis to the crime-fighter trying to stop him . Penelope Ann Miller plays the cool , sassy babe Margo , who is Reinhardt's daughter and The Shadow Lamont Cranston's love-interest . The Late Peter Boyle has an amusing turn as Cranston's cabby , always on call when the crime-fighter needs him . Thanks to good production design and beautiful photography , the film is certainly great to look at , but the style has a hard time masking the cartoony theatrics of the characters and story premise . Baldwyn seems , to me anyway , to fit the role of crime-fighter extraordinaire The Shadow . The film has quality visual effects specifically in how The Shadow operates supernaturally . Still , the story itself , not to mention the development of The Shadow himself , left me a tad disappointed . There's a feeling of the film lacking something . . perhaps a stronger villain who is laughable where he should be ominous .
Sole Survivor	Denise Watson ( Anita Skinner ) , an up and coming producer for a television studio , remarkably survives an airplane crash . It seems Denise has even found a new man in her life , the physician who nursed her back to health , Dr . Brian Richardson ( Kurt Johnson ) . Yet , there's this state of unease that exists and Denise notices strange individuals standing from afar . An older actress , Karla Davis ( Caren L Larkey ) , returning from 6 years of obscurity living pretty much as a recluse , is supposed to be starring in a series of coffee commercials for Denise's company . Karla claims that she has psychic premonitions and attempts to warn Denise of potential danger she envisions in her nightmares . Through Karla we discover that Denise was not suppose to survive ( . . this is presented in a very subtle way ) her plane crash , and , in fact , those unusual folks that seem to follow Denise are in fact undead corpses , perhaps used to reclaim the one who got away from the clutches of death . When an unfortunate series of violent circumstances arise as others encounter those undead corpses " assigned " to " retrieve " Denise , she will have to depend on Brian for help , reluctant and unconvinced , at first , until his own personal investigations turn up some really odd information ( . . certain corpses moved into a coroner's lab show signs of blood collection in their legs as if they had died standing ; and a particular corpse , which kills someone close to Denise , shown as to have died of a coronary , actually was muddy and wet and lying in his car seat in a way not associated with the forensic evidence ) . Can Denise escape from death that is stalking her ? Will Brian be able to save her ? This was a nice surprise . Pretty spooky little movie , with limited violence ( . . the zombies of the film attack humans who pose a threat to their mission ) . Director Thom Eberhardt is more concerned with building that state of unrest and that terror towards the heroine intensifies as the zombies of the film gradually become more of a threat . At first , the undead watch from afar , lifeless and emotionless , as if they had moved from the slab to spy on her . Then with each appearance , they are more and more threatening ( . . the parking garage scene where Denise narrowly escapes in an elevator as a zombie closes in from behind is an effectively suspenseful sequence ) , until those who aren't particularly targets fall prey to them for being in the wrong place at the wrong time . A quite interesting twist develops regarding those who are killed by the zombies , themselves pose a threat to Denise's life . I really liked how Eberhardt establishes the undead predators , often shooting them from far away . . kind of reminds me of Michael Myers , who looks on at a target before setting in for the kill . The eerie shots of the silent city at night with the streets practically empty ( . . with his camera particularly interested in store window mannequins ) are quite effective , and I thought Eberhardt produces a great sense of hopelessness as Denise slowly descends from a confident and calm working woman into a nervous wreck popping pills , downing booze , and smoking because of her supernatural stalkers . I also appreciated the ambiguity behind the whole film , using dialogue and performance to convey the truth at what is transpiring to the tragic character of Denise and those in her inner circle attempting to run from her own mortality , death never ceasing to stop until it can secure her soul . Big thanks to Code Red for releasing this on DVD so that a new audience can appreciate it ( . . like a lot of cases , those behind the making of the film received no rewards for their labor due to the distributors ) . Eberhardt would go on to direct the cult hit , NIGHT OF THE COMET . As others have mentioned , SOLE SURVIVOR is quite reminiscent of CARNIVAL OF SOULS , although the films have very different types of female leads being pursued by very different types of ghoulish predators . Robinson Davidson also stars as Denise's reliable teenage neighbor , Kristy . Brinke Stevens has an early role as one of Kristy's school chums , who must remove her bra during a game of strip poker . My favorite sequence would have to be the chilling nightmare where Karla sees the aftermath of the plane crash as bodies lay dead amongst the debris with Denise seated alone in a dazed state .
Dementia 13	Well , I finally had a chance to watch this public domain classic , an infamous early feature from an ambitious and talented young director Francis Ford Coppola , shot in creepy black and white photography with some chilling underwater sequences , concerning a series of ax murders around the estate of a troubled matriarch's Irish castle . What haunts Lady Haloran ( Eithne Dunne ) is the drowning of her daughter under mysterious circumstances several years ago and how she annually has the family gather to visit her grave . Her sons , sculptor Richard ( William Campbell ) , planning to wed visiting fiancé Kane ( Mary Mitchel ) , and tormented Billy ( Bart Patton ) , plagued with nightmares concerning the dead sister when they were children , suffer under the gloomy shadow of their mother's deteriorating mental state . After burying her husband underwater ( . . along with some things , setting up a fake scenario regarding a business trip ) , who had tied of a heart-attack while rowing a boat , Louise Haloran ( Luana Anders ) sets her sights on her mother-in-law's inheritance , concocting a plan to gain an advantage by tricking her using the idea of the daughter's ghost returning from the grave . While in the midst of setting up the scheme , someone , cloaked in darkness , attacks her with an ax , which sets up the rest of the film . . who is the ax-wielding psycho , and does it have to do with the dead girl ? Patrick Magee is the family head-shrinker , Justin Caleb , not regarded highly for his acidic , biting comments and sharp wit towards them . He becomes amateur sleuth when unusual occurrences begin to take place , such as the missing Louise , Lady Haloran's near death at the hands of the psycho who destroys the playhouse containing her dead daughter's wax corpse , discovering a make-shift grave for the girl after draining the estate's lake ( . . motivating the lake's draining was when dolls from the dead girl's room surface ; put there by Louise before she was butchered ) , while also happening upon a grisly sight which sets in motion his plot to catch the killer . While I found a bit sluggish , pacing wise , it has some atmospheric moments and a striking setting regarding the castle . The story is actually strong despite some familiar themes , such as greed and guilt . I thought the effects on the family due to a devastating loss was well executed , and the attacks ( . . while nowhere even close to as gory as reputed to be ) are rather impressive thanks to how Coppola frames his ax-murder . . the less is more approach . The unveiling of Louise's corpse is an obvious painting , but effective enough , I guess , to at least draw a gasp from some viewers , shocked at her bloody body hanging from a meat hook . The underwater scenes where a body is dumped , slowly sinking to the bottom , the wax corpse of the girl is discovered at her grave , and a victim is attacked as she's about to exit the lake , are among my personal favorite sequences because of their eerie presentations . Magee is superb as the deducing psycho-therapist attempting to unlock the psychological answers plaguing his patient's disturbed family . Luana Anders , as the scheming daughter-in-law , makes the most of her time on screen , and is quite alluring ( . . particularly when she disrobes down to her bra and panties , diving underwater to plant toys to spook the Lady of the castle ) when she isn't plotting how to swindle inheritance from her late husband's mother .
The saw is what we live by .	A direct reverse of the original , this sequel is a comedy ( albeit a twisted one ) masquerading as a horror film . There's never really a moment where you experience true horror . This film , thanks to a much larger budget , is too polished to get under the skin ( . . unless you are easily offended by cannibal jokes ) . I don't recall one genuine moment that haunts you or even scare you . Despite what happens to heroine Williams , you never feel like she'll not survive . Several of those key ingredients this film lacks is what gave the original it's punch and long-lasting status as a film that must be experienced by every horror fan . The film really boasts having Hopper in it . . though , to be honest , he's coasting here . It's Williams who gets the camera time . . well , her and Leatherface ( . . which can be a good and bad thing ) . Leatherface has all the aura of terror stripped from him here and he's more of a laughing-stock . His brothers torment him and we get an understanding of why he's so strange . The film has a tour-de-nuts performance from Moseley as the brother with a silver plate on his skull ( . . to add dimension , he often takes a hanger and peels off dead skin from his head , around the silver dome , to munch on ) and tendency to use a dead corpse as a puppet to speak through . Poor Williams just gets a raw deal as she tries being heroic , going to ex-Texas ranger Hopper with a recorded taping of a murder by Leatherface and Moseley of two college partiers . Hopper seeks vengeance for the murder of a relative at the hands of the Sawyer family . Using poor Williams , he finds their creepy lair . . an abandoned amusement park . Williams goes through pretty much the same as the original version's heroine . Her head is stuck over a bucket for great grandpa to beat over with a hammer . She gets her own friend's skinned face placed on there by Leatherface . . and is made to dance with him ! She has to fight through all kinds of hell to escape their lair after falling through a hole in the ground . This film is loaded with gore , lots of chainsaw stabbings ( . . we see Leatherface's guts hanging out as Hopper hacks away with his own chainsaw ) , and demented humor . It's overkill , but the blasted movie is so enthusiastic and over-the-top , the sequel becomes entertaining within all the madness .
Day of the Evil Gun	Not bad little western starring Glenn Ford as Lorne Warfield , a gunfighter who has had his belly-full of killing and just wishes to carve out a new life with his wife and two daughters . When he finds they have been kidnapped by Apaches , Warfield will have quite a few obstacles in his path before he can rescue them . Arthur Kennedy has the best role of the film as Owen Forbes , a man in love with Warfield's wife and resents the man for walking out on his family . Forbes is slowly growing accustomed to killing as many will die by his gun along the way . Warfield is always looking over his shoulder in regards to Forbes but will have to form a partnership with him in order to somehow survive an accompaniment of ordeals along the way such as Army deserters wishing to make a trade with those Apaches who have kidnapped Warfield's family . They'll have to contend with Mexicans , also . The film is excellently photographed by cinematographer W Wallace Kelley , especially many numerous long shots which really open wide the hot desert landscape Warfield must ride ( . . and walk ) along the way . But Kelley's marvelous camera-work during the Apache attack on the small town filled with betrayed Army deserters led by John Anderson's Jefferson Addis , is wonderful to behold . Probably my favorite sequence is when Warfield and Forbes have been tied up to be meat for the buzzards as we watch and wonder in horror how they'll ever escape this ordeal . When you have Glenn Ford and Arthur Kennedy as your leads , a film would be hard to dislike . This one does have a rather routine plot , but as I mention above the cast and photography is first-rate .
The Hound of the Baskervilles	The Baker Street detective team of Sherlock Holmes ( Peter Cushing , in fine form as the studious , sophisticated , unflappable intellectual with a nose that knows ) and Dr . John Watson ( André Morell as the always-surprised good physician who often inspires the answers Holmes needs through out-loud observation ) are called on by Doctor Richard Mortimer ( Francis De Wolff ) to protect the well being of the last remaining relative of the Baskerville family line , the tall & dashing Sir Henry ( Christopher Lee , with not much to do except for looking like a wealthy aristocrat ) . It seems that an old family curse has taken Henry's uncle Charles through a hereditary heart ailment causing failure at what seems like something that elicited shocking fright . Henry also has a weak heart so it provides Holmes and Watson with an opportunity to not only cease the death of the last aristocrat left while also solving a mystery of what has taken the lives of several of the Baskervilles . Various sub-plots develop which may provide a key to the mystery's being solved , father and daughter poverty-stricken farmers , Mr . Stapleton ( Ewen Solon ) and Cecile ( Marla Landi ) who live on the moors near the Baskerville Hall , a tarantula that was stolen from Bishop Frankland ( Miles Malleson whose priest really loves his sherry ) a renowned entomologist whose stolen spider was placed in Henry's boot to possibly kill him , an escaped convict who was found butchered and mutilated wearing some of Henry's clothes , and a dagger used by Sir Hugo to kill a servant girl which has been found by Holmes at the sight where the convict's body was first found . As Holmes and Watson pursue the answers that unravel as the case develops clues , the howling of the moors enhances as does the possible love affair between Sir Henry and Cecile . Important aspect in the tale has Holmes finding an abandoned old mineshaft where a bone , important to the mystery of what it howling , lies inside . While looking and finding the bone ( with Mortimer and Mr . Stapleton guiding him inside ) , a cave-in collapses almost killing our sleuth begging the question . . who would want to silence Holmes ? Is Holmes finding a specific bone in this mine detrimental to a certain discovery someone wants kept hidden ? Hammer studios provides fans of atmospheric horror another colorful , flavorful flick with the Moors an exciting setting for a Holmes / Watson mystery . With Cushing and Morell a fun team , and the fog shrouded moors providing an eerie mood , this is a ton of fun for fans of Conan Doyle and Hammer horror .
The Black Cat	One thing I often have a problem with when watching Fulci is not his gifted , truly blessed stylish touch , particularly how well he can film faces and use the dark so ominously and effectively . . it's his unfocused , often incredibly pee-brained plots . This plot has this bizarre idea that a man named Robert Miles , fueling with a repressed hatred for others such as a past lady-love , can force a cat , through hypnotic suggestion to attack others ( while , as we see in the opening kill , the cat itself possesses a driver to send his car straight into a parked vehicle . . which means that Miles possesses the cat which possesses another man . Alrighty then . ) . Then , the story shifts where the cat can make Miles do it's bidding after the ex-professor attempts to kill it . Now , I didn't understand how this mumbo jumbo works so maybe you can tell me . Anyway , various victims fall prey to the cat such as a local drunk who falls on a pitchfork , a woman ( Miles lady-love ) who gets burned alive in her house , a young couple who are seen on the floor with foam coming out of their mouth ( ? ! ) , and Inspector Gorley ( David Warbeck ) of Scotland Yard who is forced by the cat to walk in front of a moving car ( ! ) . Jill ( Mimsy Farmer ) , a top-notch photographer , is in the village to lense old ruins . She comes in contact with both Miles and the cat when she hears men chatting about the mad psychic professor in a pub . Immediately her life is in great danger , especially after she's asked to take crime-scene photos and notices several cat claw gashes on a victim's hand ( the drunkard who receives the pitchfork in his torso ) . And , the young couple found dead ( due to information Miles provides his former lady-love begging for his assistance in finding her missing daughter ) had locked their door from the inside of the shack where they were found leaving only a tiny duct as the only entrance in ( . . for which Jill sees cat footprints in sand within that duct exit ) . So , the cat's identity is threatened . But , as Jill seeks after the truth , will she be able to survive Miles ' wrath or be trapped within a mortared wall never to be seen again ? In this film , Fulci uses a really cool camera trick by lensing from the eyes of the cat as it heads for a particular destination suggesting to the viewer that possible death was imminent . Fulci also loves to focus the camera in on the crazed ( . . and , at times , focused ) eyes of Patrick Magee , a really intense actor who has the ability to show facets of madness so incredibly and convincingly . Fulci creates some really foreboding shots of his mad face within the dark . The film is quite Gothic with Fulci very dependent on fog as a mood piece . Not overtly violent , but gets it's point across . There are some nasty moments when the cat attacks the hands and face of certain victims . But , this is at it's best an exercise in style . . which Fulci can give to us in abundance .
Trauma	A serial killer , who collects heads from the victims he / she decapitates , " murders " a troubled anorexic teen's " medium " mother ( Piper Laurie ) and Romanian father ( Dominique Serand ) . David ( Chris Rydell ) , an artist , assists Aura ( Asia Argento ) in her quest to find out the butcher who claimed the lives of her parents while also trying desperately to remain distant from the clutches of Dr . Judd ( Frederic Forrest ) who wants to put her back in the Farraday Clinic so that she can get the proper treatment from her illness . Meanwhile , the killer continues killing selected people as David and Aura find out that each person was acquainted with one another and it deals with a tragic accident one rainy night with a Dr . Lloyd ( Brad Dourif ) playing a major part . As they search for answers , the motive for the headhunter will become clear . The killer lives next door to a boy who studies and collects butterflies . That boy notices the wire-machine that the killer uses to collect his / her head-trophies and will play a specific part at the end . A decent Argento effort is better than a lot of horror directors ' really good work and TRAUMA has a visual polish and style ( . . not to mention ghoulish , sometimes humorous , beheadings ) that makes up for a rather tacky ending . . an ending I just didn't really buy into . I thought the one beheading , from a female victim David finds out about Lloyd from , is quite inspired as is a head-removal using an elevator shaft . Argento uses POV shots mostly with the camera acting as the eyes of the killer . Perhaps the melodrama concerning anorexia is a tad heavy-handed ( . . this is a slasher flick after all ) , but Argento admitted the story regarding the disease was personal ( concerning a niece he has that was suffering with it at the time he decided on making a film with a female lead character suffering with the problem ) . It brings a uniqueness to the character so I have no real qualms with it .
The Toxic Avenger	When I was a teenager , the only available place to watch trash was on USA's Up All Night which showed their movies cut with just enough on screen to tease and tantalize . A trio of films appeared on USA which caught my attention , the Toxic Avenger series , and I was introduced to Troma . This was their flagship series , and it was rare that you'd find any other item as entertainingly zany , sick , and cheap as these films . Even close to these films were the Class of Nuke ' Em High movies which dealt with high school kids introduced to what toxic waste could do . But , in The Toxic Avenger , a geeky , buck-teethed janitor whose trusty mop was always by his side , ogling the bikini-clad aerobics gals who'd come to the gym he was employed to maintain their impressive bods , is the subject of what toxic waste can do to your anatomy when the skin and body are immersed in such chemicals . . it can turn you into a grotesque superhero with amazing physique and martial arts skills , not to mention you can rip arms off and propel men in the air with ease . It all starts when four psychopaths , Slug ( Robert Prichard ) , maniac Bozo ( Gary Schneider ) , and their girlfriends , Wanda ( Jennifer Prichard ) and Julie ( Cindy Manion ) who frequent a gym wish to cause " mop boy " Melvin Junko ( Mark Torgle ) as much harm and humiliation as possible just for the hell of it . During their past time , these four enjoy driving over innocent people with Bozo's car , adding up points kind of like in the movie Death Race 2000 . We see this when the four single out a kind little kid with a helmet riding his bike as they run him over before crushing his head under their back tire ! They take Polaroids , for which gets the girls hot and bothered . Yep , this is not for the squeamish or those who demand films of good taste . Anyway , Julie prompts Melvin to slip on a pink tutu so that she can get all worked up for a little sex , setting the poor kid up for a cruel practical joke , concerning a lamb , with all the customers of the gym laughing their asses off at his expense . Tormented and crazed , Melvin throws himself through a window . What Melvin doesn't expect is to fall into a barrel of toxic waste placed inside a parked truck hauling the stuff to a nearby landfill . The toxic waste in turn transforms Melvin into a ghastly monster with a homing beacon towards evil . Anyone corrupt , gangsters , hoodlums , and crooked city officials , are targets of the Toxic Avenger . Three slimy thieves with weapons attempting to rob a taco store with an innocent bi-stander getting a shot-gun blast to the chest , a blind beauty's seeing-eye-dog also getting it right in the stomach , with our toxic superhero coming to save the day . He rips the leader's arm off before stuffing him into a stove , makes an ice-cream sundae out of another's face before driving a drill into his eye , and boiling the last criminal's hands in grease ! A gang of mobster's thugs beating up a beat cop get their heads caved in by crushing blows while the third gets away momentarily before attempting to retaliate with more hoods carrying arsenal . This all takes place before Melvin can get his revenge against the four who ultimately wronged him the most . There's a loopy sub-plot featuring the love-affair between Toxie and a blind babe who talks with eyes WIDE open ( . . she's the one with the dog who got shot by the hoods in the taco store ) . And , the actual chief villain of the film is the corrupt mayor of Tromaville ( . . the humongous Pat Ryan ) who works behind the scenes with the villainous scum behind the crime of the city . He wants Toxie dead for the heroic monster is bad for business . Obviously , this includes far more gratuitous material than was shown on USA many years ago , including boobs , gory violence , and ample profanity . There's a photo of the aftermath of the bicycle kid's brains all over the pavement , a crooked underling of the mayor gets his head smashed by a set of weights , and Toxie thrusts his fist into a stomach removing the guts . As you'd expect with a Troma film , the acting is ( . . intentionally ) so rotten it's hostile to the eyes , the camera-work & editing are ( . . purposely ) unprofessional , and the characters are ( . . obviously ) written as farcical ( . . and dimwitted ) as possible . Everything in the film is heightened to a great degree crying aloud . . this is supposed to be as loud and warped and sophomoric as possible for the viewing enjoyment of those with an appreciation for trash . There's this little part of me that embraces a film like Toxic Avenger because I think it succeeds in what it sets out to do , and the crowd catered to get their money's worth . The film is basically a vehicle to shock and disgust and does so unabashedly .
Diary of the Dead	I remember seeing a very uncomfortable George Romero being interviewed by one of his stars John Leguisamo on the DVD for " Land of the Dead " and realized that this director is always in a better place when he can make the zombie films his way , not under the tyrannical eye of studio bosses who wish to add their two cents to how he should do this and that . I later watched the DVD document on " Diary of the Dead " and George appeared spirited and relaxed . . he was making the film with a much smaller budget , independently without the pressures that plagued his previous undead picture . Saying that , the new undead film I felt was a heavy-handed but ultimately satisfying excursion into the Blair Witch territory of what the camera eyeballs in real time with an obsessed starving student filmmaker wishing to capture their experiences for a misinformed public to see . I think the heavy-handedness is in the narration from Debra ( Michelle Morgan ) who is our voice into the aftermath of a zombie plague that has slowly swept across the United States and world , and how our government in America is trying to keep the truth from us , telling the story of her boyfriend Jason Creed , a starving student filmmaker who often aggravates his peers with how he drives them to participate in the live emotions they feel while capturing the situations they face . The experiences as the group moves from one place to the next include coming across zombies , a town group who have formed a society using goods abandoned by a frightened public seeking shelter elsewhere , nasty National Guardmen who want their food , a kindly mute Amish farmer who offers a barn refuge when the zombie close in , a hospital when one of the students shoots herself in desperation after driving through people , Debra's parents ' house , and a fellow student's parents ' mansion equipped with a safe room . There is a limited amount of zombies which will undoubtedly disappoint those fans wanting non-stop grue . The flesh eating is at a minimum and , unlike the previous four in the undead series , there isn't a " feeding frenzy " where a large group are overrun and rip to pieces by hungry zombies . The cast is mostly young college movie career types with cell phones and egos , wishing to remain alive not knowing what lies ahead , by forging forward anyway with Jason capturing everything he can , even putting his life in great danger . For me , I felt what hurts Romero's film is that so many zombie films have flooded the market over the years , not much of what takes place feels fresh . The technique used for the plot of this undead film has been applied by dozens of other filmmakers over the years . And , sadly , there's nothing fresh about our government's methods at concealing the truth from a terrified and confused public . These will factor into , I'm sure , why many will side against " Diary . . " although , I enjoyed Romero's attempts at something different , in his undead series . The novelty of this modern age's media overload , with the internet & cell phones , used as a device to tell his story , I think Romero's social satire might just be laid on a bit thick , but I understood what he was trying to do . Romero has admitted that each zombie film is meant to make statements on the life of civilization in the world ( . . or town in the US ) at each specific time , so the facts that he explores how our nation might react to such an undead plague has potential for exploration . Now that I found out a sequel is in the works , perhaps as a series , this film will work better once it's companion is made . The use of cell phones , the internet & regular steadicams does provide some affective scenes along the way ( . . as does security cameras ) . Romero injects dark humor in the film , as well , and I like the little mummy gag . Romero uses a combination of practical effects with computer graphics . But , the film is ultimately about the effects of a zombie outbreak overtaking a nation through the eyes ( . . and camera ) of a group of would-be student filmmakers . The violent bits include : what one victim , bitten , does with a scythe when a zombie is tearing into his neck , putting the curved blade through two heads in one strike . A zombie's skull disintegrates from acid . A zombie nurse's eyes explode ( . . yet , it continues to pursue humans after the fact ) after electric jolts from a defibrillator machine thanks to paddles applied to her head by one of the scared students seeking help for their friend who had just shot herself .
The Devil's Rejects	A trio of sadistic psychopaths escape from the law , retreating to the hooker ranch of a relative pimp , as a determined , hostile sheriff ( . . out to avenge his slain cop brother , a victim of theirs ) is out to find them , with wicked plans to make the group suffer in store . Rob Zombie's mosaic of 70's Grindhouse amidst a western motif , features a gallery of unpleasant characters , committing horrendous acts towards innocent people . It's simple . . if you do not have the willingness to operate on the same level as the evil hoodlums you are pursuing , then you're dead . The Firefly clan have no moral constraints or are they bound by the laws of appropriate decency . . they love terrorizing the weak-willed and positively embrace wickedness of all types . Obviously modeled somewhat after the Manson family , The Firefly clan thumb their nose at conventional behavior , in favor of raising as much hell as humanly possible . Kidnapping , sexual molestation , mind games , torture , and murder . . the Firefly family have no qualms in harming and brutalizing those with the misfortune of entering their orbit . Zombie produces an adversary in Sheriff Sheriff John Quincy Wydell ( . . played with intensity and ferocity by William Forsythe , in perhaps his finest role to date ) who goes beyond the law in order to apprehend and inflict his own brand of justice against these fiends . It's clear that Zombie wants to produce a subtext in this war . . is Wydell any different than those he's hunting ? I think this film really goes into a dark place despite the black humor , where we watch a man , hired by his citizens to uphold the law , progressively going mad , believing he is God's " arm of vengeance " , willing to hire vicious bounty hunters ( . . portrayed by pro-wrestler Diamond Dallas Page and Danny Trejo , who call themselves the " Unholy Two " , I call them the " White Trash Duo " ) to find them for him . You know , Zombie doesn't let either the Firfly Trio or Wydell off the hook . We witness Otis and Baby ( Bill Moseley & Sheri Moon Zombie ) hold a traveling blue-grass group hostage at gun point , slowly terrorizing them in various ways before disposing of them . So Rob exposes in detail their willingness to hurt others , absolutely enjoying their handiwork . This film has Captain Spaulding ( Sid Haig ) in on the action this time , as the three gather at the western whorehouse town of his " brother from another mother " , Charlie Altamont ( Ken Foree ) . Zombie's style of the film has lots of action shot from several perspectives and the camera-work is never still . . the film is always moving , with Rob insisting on a documentary kind of feel ( . . He even hired a documentary cinematographer , Phil Pharmet of HARLIN COUNTY USA fame ) placing the viewer right into the center of the action as the tale of the criminals and their hunter unfolds . Those that decide to commit crime pay a hefty price , even if Zombie's film likes to paint a heroic picture of the Firefly clan , unabashed serial killers lovingly cruel , doing so for kicks and giggles . They even get to go out to the beautiful ballad of FREEBIRD . . very much outlaws going out on their own terms , not Wydell's . But , just like we watched Otis and Baby prey upon the family of Banjo and Sullivan , Wydell gets his chance to make them suffer as well . Neither brutal attack is fun to watch , both , at times , explicit in violence , performed with relish and damaging intent . I remember having a hard time sitting through the attack on Roy Sullivan ( Geoffrey Lewis ) , his wife Gloria ( Priscilla Barnes ) , Adam Banjo ( Lew Temple ) , his wife Wendy ( Kate Norby ) and their roadie , Jimmy ( Brian Posehn ) with Otis and Baby often deriding them waving their guns around , ordering them around , using threats as an advantage , controlling their every move thanks to possessing weapons . I must say that Norby and Barnes are real troopers for allowing such awful things to take place to their characters , willing to subject themselves to offensive acts committed by Otis towards them . There are times , such as when the camera shoots from the ground into Otis ' face as he prepares to crush Roy's skull with a large stick , that he looks exactly like a young Charles Manson . . makes the scene even more powerful and creepy , particularly when he proclaims he's the Devil , doing the Devil's work . Actually , Zombie shows less violence than you realize , effectively using sound effects as the camera moves around the acts themselves ( . . such as when Wydell uses a stapler one Otis and Baby , puncturing pictures of victims to their chests or when he jabs Spaudling with a cattle prod ) . There are some effective uses of the camera capturing poor Wendy attempting to escape one time , another running around , completely insane seeking help , wearing her husband's facial " skin mask " that echoes THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE ( . . Marlyn Burns running in terror as Leatherface follows with his chainsaw ) , finding herself in the middle of the road as a semi hits her head on . Superb soundtrack impressively accompanies the movie , adding a little extra to Zombie's intentions of presenting us a realistic 70's atmosphere . His influences , like in his first film , are present for us to see . . Zombie doesn't hide from the fact that certain kinds of directors ' works inspired him and that is ever present in THE DEVIL'S REJECTS . Hiliarious scene where Wydell is enraged by a Groucho Marx-loving movie critic who makes derogatory remarks about The King . . and the " chicken f # cking " scene where a furious Michael Berryman ( . . as Charlie's employee ) gets all tore up about a poultry farmer's insults towards his possibly humping a chicken , due to his " sexually frustrated looks . " The cast seem to be enjoying themselves , but the subject matter can be quite grueling and disturbing at times , especially if the viewer ( s ) isn't in the right state of mind .
Rocky Balboa	For those who have a place in your heart for this beloved character perhaps will hold this film to high esteem . To be honest , I was holding back the tears in the very first few moments because The Rock was visiting his darling wife's grave . He is quietly enigmatic as he frequents the old Philly streets of his youth pulling the memories that flow deep down in his heart . . just reminiscing those cherished times between him and his Adrian . I believe the film is not just a final decisive close for the old champ , but a loving ode to Philly where the man is an icon . Stallone pours his heart and soul into this character making him so vivid and real . You love him because The Rock is a representation of old school hard work , guts and determination . The film itself has a nearly 60-year old arthritic restaurateur Rocky , who shares experiences in the ring with those who visit his food establishment , contemplating a return to the ring . He doesn't know that the " money-people " behind Boxing Champ " The Line " Dixon want The Rock to have an exhibition bout with their champ for charity . It all spurns from an outcry at a very simple little experiment ESPN ran regarding a computer simulated fight between Rocky , in his youth , and the now-Champ Dixon . When buzz circulates regarding The Rock getting cleared by the boxing commission to fight , Dixon's people definitely see the dollar-signs this fight would fork in . The film is ultimately about Rocky having one last chance to prove to himself , he can go one last fight with a real competitor . Like the film itself , Stallone allows the character to go out with a sterling close . The fight itself is often been criticized , but I felt it had enough action to satisfy those looking for action . It is heavily edited , but we see lots of impacting blows and Stallone shows how great his physique is at such an older age . The only major character returning to this film is Paulie ( Burt Young ) , Talia Shire's Adrian is viewed through Rocky's eyes in haunting ghostly flashbacks when he frequents areas where they bonded as love-partners . Milo Ventimigilia plays Rocky's son . Geraldine Hughes is really good as Rocky's possible love-interest Marie ( this growing relationship makes up a good portion of the film as Rocky bonds with Marie's son " Steps " ) . Tony Burton makes a surprising turn as Duke , the man who reshapes Rocky's work-out regimen .
Clan of the Cave Bear	Ayla , a Cro-Magnon ( Daryl Hannah ) tries her damnedest to become a part of the Neanderthal " Clan of the Cave Bear " tribe , but is met with constant resistance because many are secretly afraid of her . The film clearly dictates that Ayla is superior in many ways to the Neanderthals for she can indeed depend on her own abilities while the women of the tribe often are subservient in every way . She tries to adapt , but her greatest foe is Broud ( Thomas G . Waites ) , a warrior of the clan who may be groomed as leader one day . Broud seems threatened by Ayla and uses his clout in the clan ( mainly his being male ) to often force her into unfortunately uncomfortable situations . Ayla , though , is gutsy and determined . She isn't dumb and is able to learn how to use hunter's tools even though if she is indeed caught even touching them it means certain death . We see that the Neanderthal tribe live by their belief in spirits in every conceivable way . The spirits determine their course of action in many arenas of life including specific choices they desire for the group . Creb ( James Remar ) is a scar-faced " Mag-or " who becomes quite fond of Ayla and Iza ( Pamela Reed ) becomes her surrogate mother . Ayla lost her mother to a hideous earthquake and was scratched on the leg by a lion while hiding in a small crack in stone . Ayla , if left to her own devices , probably would've perished if Iza hadn't pitied her . The film's theme is quite adjacent to the thinking of today . A woman can change the ways men often believe should stay as they are . Ayla plays such an archetypal role as Ayla . What she does over the course of the film is challenge an inferior way of life and in the end comes off as being very right . In the opening paragraph ( . . and throughout Salome Jens ' narration ) we understand that Ayla's memory would remain long past the declining Neanderthals that would soon vanish . If you can not change then you're sure to vanish away with the dust in the wind . . I guess that is how I perceive John Sayles's script from the novel being in a round-about way . Sayles seems , to me , to be using the Clan as a metaphor for us in modern society . The mores and ways of the tribe are challenged and considered fodder for certain extinction because they could not change and grow . Ayla was the way of doing just that and in ways her upending of Broud proves that the Clan could've improved if they had followed her path . The film can probably be seen two different ways . Those who approach it seriously understanding that Sayles and Chapman wanted to create something unique and interesting or as a laughable exercise . It is not at all a critics ' darling . . anything but . I have to say though that I enjoyed it and found it interesting to watch . I liked the approach at having the clan speak this native talk with us following along in subtitles . . and yet this could be found laughable if the person can not accept it . I think the film is flawed in how the clan is portrayed . I myself do not believe this could happen . I certainly can not envision a young woman getting away with what Ayla does , but I didn't mind it because I felt I could see Sayles ' reason for doing so ( . . that is if he was using the Clan as a metaphor for our more intelligent modern society and how we and many other countries still have our resistance against change ) . Many complain about Hannah being in this film , but I liked her myself . It's also wonderfully shot by cinematographer Jan de Bont . I think the movie's acceptance will come down to each individual viewer . What one is willing to accept in regards to how the film portrays this people and their confrontations with Ayla .
Alligator	Scientific hormone testing to enlarge animals so that the world can reap the benefits of a wider food market , leads to the massive size of an alligator resting in the Chicago sewers ready to munch on anyone who dares venture into his lair . A pet store operator / veterinarian brings a major scientific company abandoned puppies for hormone testing with the remains of the dead animals dumped in the sewers . Chicago detective David Madison ( . . an engagingly likable Robert Forster , good as always ) , reeling from a partner's death when he was a cop in St . Louis , is the man who must stop the alligator before it threatens an entire city . His superiors , Chief Clark ( Michael V Gazzo , of " Fingers " fame ) and the mayor ( Jack Carter ) make it hard on Madison after his investigation leads to the hormone testing company whose chairman has major political ties and the power to wield the detective's way . He enlists the aide , and soon falls in love with , reptile expert Marisa Kendall ( Robin Riker ) whose expertise come in handy as he pursues the location of the alligator . Madison's task proves very difficult as the gator , despite it's massive size , is often able to elude police officers searching for it . Soon the alligator surfaces above ground roaming the streets of the city looking for fresh meat . One of the major effects of the hormones that increase the size of those experimented on is an insatiable appetite and the alligator is always on the prowl for fresh victims . When the gator continues to kill , Madison is removed from the case and a respected , egomaniacal " Great White Hunter " , Colonel Brock ( Henry Silva , who steals the film when he appears in one of his signature roles ) is called in to get the beast . But , can anyone stop the alligator ? It was a lot of fun re-visiting the wonderful creature feature from the early 80's . What doesn't this movie have ? Great cast full of very likable and established characters , a very witty script , alligator carnage ( . . you get the gory goods as the beast munches down on humans ) , and a brisk pace . The alligator feasts everywhere in this film . There's a scary scene where Madison loses a policeman to the gator when the manhole cover wouldn't budge . There's a great sequence where the gator explodes from a concrete onto a street as kids with wide-eyes playing run in fear as a policeman's car crashes with the officer inside getting his leg bitten off . There's one harrowing scene where the gator is resting in a neighborhood pool when a child falls in accidentally and is eaten ! Of course , those responsible for the gator's creation are attacked at a wedding reception where the hired help , and others , get chewed up and spit out ( . . not to mention , one getting smashed in his limo ) , and , equally memorable is Silva's fate in a street alley . Oh , and there's a great homage to Jaws where one man is trying to swim to a boat and gets both his legs ripped away by the gator . Silva has a marvelous scene where he finds gator poop . And , even a homage to " The Third Man " is thrown in for laughs . Suspenseful , smart , gory & funny . . ALLIGATOR delivers the goods on all levels . I give a lot of love to Blue Underground and Lionsgate for a high-quality DVD transfer and very good interview with screenplay writer John Sayles . Monster movie fans should not be disappointed with this one .
The Scarecrow reviews " Piranha "	I want anyone reading this to know that my review is full of spoilers for to explain my opinions on why Dante's film so good depends on many plot points being exploited to make my point . One of the most important aspects of the film that I feel made Dante's film better than many of the horror pictures that would splatter on screens in the 80's , 90's , & even today is his depiction of the characters in the film . Unlike many horror films where the characters are so one sided ( most of the time simply unlikable ) where we just don't really care if they live or die thanks to the writers and direction , it's quite clear that Dante does . The children at the camp and their female counselors who are attacked are not bad people . One camp counselor who perishes is a good , warm hearted person who doesn't deserve to die . That specific scene is built unrelentingly by Dante . Throughout the film , Dante builds in our eyes the fact that piranha fish a heading to munch on unsuspected people who venture into waters they have no right believing are dangerous . That tension that Dante builds works because we know that if no one warns them in time , people will die quite horribly . I can only speak with the heart of a parent when I say that the moment the piranha fish begin to attack the children my heart beat 90 miles an hour . The film had been up to that point one of those very funny spoofs which uses clever humorous wit within it's shots at government's hidden secrets at developing war weaponry ( in this case piranha to " poison " the waters of Vietnam , but the project was halted when the conflict was deemed over ) that could have an aftereffect on Americans . But , once sweet innocent children ( just simply having water competitions ) are beginning to be attacked , the film carries a much more serious tone . The build up to a feeding is hauntingly done with a few actually paying the price for what their government ( who was suppose to protect not destroy ) did to them . But , things are even more grim when tourists are viciously attacked during a water festival . We see an explosion of horror as innocents out in the water are being torn to shreds . Body parts are shown throughout and much blood . The fun from the opening turns grisly as we see what can happen when a government goes to far , and in their ineptitude don't finish a clean-up job eradicating something they created in a lab . But , in returning to my position above , Dante's treatment of his characters is essential , I believe , to how I was impacted . Dante cloaks his female camp counselors with sweet music . We hear them talk and see how good they are to the children . They aren't like the sex-crazed counselors you might see in other films . Their language isn't obscene . They never gesture that dislike their jobs or those kids they are assigned to . When we see one of them trying to escape into a raft during the attack on the children , there was a realization that this woman was in trouble of dying . We see her helplessly try to grab hold to her friend's hand , but the vicious attack from those monsters in the water just won't release her . In a moment that just won't leave me , Dante shows the piranha carry her into the darkened emptiness of the water and she's lost to us all . It's a scene that devastates me because she's not a stupid ingrate that we often see in horror films , but a very likable human being who is taken away to be slaughtered . The final closing scene shows the aftermath of many dead because the man in charge of the festival wouldn't heed the warning of a woman who knew that the piranha were heading their way . The film shows that in not at least taking a warning seriously could lead to such horror . Dante won't let the viewer off the hook . He lets us see the piranha swimming in a pack heading for people who do not know what is coming . Dante could let our heroes get to the children in time and the tourists in time , but many will meet their doom . Dante delivers on the gore . He achieves both levels . The impact of the building up of the attack and subsequent violence that will certainly occur . We see heads eating , legs bitten off , blood soaking with shards of meat in the water , and the aftermath . In the final scene , the festival owner ( as the camp head looks over the sheeted body of a child he'd been warned to protect ahead of time ) looks over the sheet-covered bodies of victims , those who simply came to the beach to swim and have a good time . Sure , perhaps our heroes were able ( ? ) to poison the piranha with waste , but the aftermath is what leaves the viewer knowing that it is little too late to save those who weren't warned that it was quite possible that they could've been attacked . Yet , even then Dante gives them reason . They hear a call ( both the head of the camp and the festival head ) from a person that tells them deadly piranha fish are heading their direction . It would perhaps elicit laughter ( or disbelief ) from you to , wouldn't it ? You see Dante and writer John Sayles cover all bases . The film , I feel , is really good because it builds up and then delivers .
Phenomena	You get your money's worth with this journey into the bizarre world of Dario Argento . You get a heroic chimp who uses a razor to avenge the murder of her beloved owner , a girl with a telepathic ability to communicate and control insects ( . . who also assist in helping her find clues in the search for a killer ) , and a psychotic killer monster boy . The striking beauty of teenager Jennifer Connelly is used to the utmost effect as she sees female girls being stalked , a specific hall which will become very important later on , and the horrified faces of victims , as she sleepwalks . Her father is a popular actor , and she is sent to a very highly regarded Swiss school for wealthy female girls . Treated with disrespect by everyone , Jennifer finds a friend in a gentle , soft-spoken , wheel-chair bound entomologist , Professor John McGregor ( Donald Pleasence ) , who keeps a lab devoted to insects of all kinds , and has assisted the police in determining the time of death for corpses . John finds Jennifer's unique telepathic gift intriguing and useful in perhaps finding and catching a killer who is murdering young female teens in the area . But , both will find themselves in danger as someone will do whatever it takes to keep the killer's identity safe . We see in the opening a young foreign girl , who missed her tour bus , brutally slain by someone who was able to break free from chains nailed into a wall . This event would lead to the string of murders afterward . Daria Nicolodi resembles Norman Bates ' mother in a very creepy performance . Dario is unrestrained in this film , embracing the supernatural to tell his story . Violent use of a spear is how the killer often murders his / her victims , such as the girl stabbed through the head , resulting in the blade protruding out of the mouth . A pair of scissors is stabbed into a hand . A head is severed as the victim is attempting to greet Jennifer . A man , to free himself from chains binding him , must smash his broken hand to remove the shackles . A face is sliced repeatedly by the vengeful monkey . My favorite sequence has Jennifer discovering the watery pit containing various skulls and body parts , kept by the killer as tokens ( . . she actually falls in , attempting to drag herself out of it with heavy resistance by the guardian of the psycho ) . I think less discriminating viewers will lap this crazy little horror flick up , while others will find it hogwash . I thought it was fun . I guess you could call this a supernatural giallo . Odd mixture of musical score and rock ( . . Iron Maidan & Motorhead ) layered throughout . It was neat seeing Pleasence working in an Argento film . He has a really strong supporting role , very sympathetic character and extremely likable .
Volver	Raimunda ( Penélope Cruz ) has a difficult series of complications plaguing her life . A dead beat husband who doesn't exactly go out of his way looking for work . He's not really her daughter Sole's ( Lola Dueñas ) father ( . . that is complicated , and , as typical of director Almodóvar , is a shocking revelation ) , and we get a scene where he stares at her removing her clothes . Later Raimunda gets off a bus at the street near home and finds that Sole has murdered her husband . It was an accident of tragic proportions , but actually improves their lives ! Raimunda's husband desired Sole for sex lunging at her with a butcher knife getting between them . A restaurant being closed seems like the perfect place to keep her husband's corpse . Tossing his body in the restaurant's basement freezer , she is startled to find a member of a film crew needing a place which could cook for 30 people . Raimunda seizes the opportunity and responds by cooking for them during the entire filming schedule . Meanwhile , her sister , Paula ( Yohana Cobo ) receives visits from the " ghost " of her mother , Irene ( Carmen Maura , delightful as always ) who has " returned from the grave to ask forgiveness for past sins . " Agustina ( Blanca Portillo , really good ) who has been looking after their aunt during her illness , believes in returning spirits and recalls to them how she has overheard voices at night which she thought could've been Irene's ghost . Agustina wants an answer that has remained secret for four years . . what happened to her hippy mother , who vanished , perhaps a victim of a fire . Agustina feels that Irene has the answer to that . Agustina greatly desires to know that answer for she's dying of cancer . Themes brewing in " Volver " include incest , murder , covering up the murder , familial strife due to a past act , adultery which would yield devastating consequences , potential rape , and hiding from the eventual confrontation , and this is one of his more lighter efforts ! The film , in my opinion , is mostly a showcase for his female stars . The characters of course have meat to them , but Almodóvar's blessed with actresses of such talent , that I think " Volver " rises above a " been there-done that " type of screenplay . Covering up a murder and trouble within families trying to hold secrets which will eventually surface is the thing of soapy melodramas , but he has such strong personalities , and witty dialogue they bring to life , I for one couldn't take my eyes away from the screen . When my eyes weren't gravitating towards Penélope Cruz's impressive chest , I noticed that she gave one of her finest performances to date leaving behind Hollywood for a director who can mine those great gifts she has in spades . Cruz's character is faced with a multitude of problems , yet , one by one she overcomes them . And Maura's motherly figure lights up the screen , she's simply so easy to love , it's a testament to the actress how wonderful she presents this resurfacing woman , hoping to reconcile differences that have caused such pain to various women so dear to her . Portillo as the woman wanting to know about her long lost mother , is a revelation . This rock everyone can lean on , Portillo gives Agustina depth . She seems a bit , um , eccentric in how she talks about visiting spirits needing closure for past mistakes , smokes marijuana she grows in her yard , looks after the ancient aunt the world has practically forgotten about , and remains dedicated to her mother's memory . I think the idea of Raimunda's landing the restaurant duties , having been caught in the basement by a customer shortly after disposing of a body , to be just a brilliant twist of fate . . through something horrible came something life-changing and life-affirming . But , ultimately , I think " Volver " is about closure . Here's a chance to finish unresolved issues that have been hanging around far too long .
The Hitcher	Taut , tight , tense terror tale about young Jim Halsey ( C Thomas Howell ) driving a car from a company in Chicago across country to San Diego to it's owner when he has to misfortune of picking up psychotic hitchhiker John Rider ( a quietly menacing Rutger Hauer ) . Able to push Ryder from his car , Jim believes he's seen the last of John , but doesn't know that this is just the beginning of what he'll be up against . Anyone Jim comes in contact with , including local police or a family in a station wagon , perish at the bloodthirsty hands of sicko Ryder . Ryder frames Jim , however , placing the murderous knife he has been using to slash victims in his coat pocket . Local police send out a massive manhunt when , while Jim is imprisoned , John kills all the police officers in the station setting up the poor young man as the one responsible . The mystery in question is why doesn't Ryder just kill Halsey ? Why all the cat-and-mouse that ensues ? Perhaps John wishes for the murderous impulses to stop and believes Jim is the one able enough to succeed ? Jennifer Jason Leigh has a supporting role as Nash , a waitress on her way to California who saves Jim from possible death at the hands of a cop seeking retribution for the murder of two deputies he believed were killed by him ( . . yet , we know that it was committed by John ; it's a pattern in this flick where Jim seemingly has no hope as Ryder is much more good and prepared in this game than him ) . Will Jim be able to protect Nash when he himself could've easily been dispatched numerous times by John ? And , will Jim ever be able to clear his muddied name and just survive the carnage lying in the wake of John's murderous rampage ? They just don't make movies like this anymore . There has to be numerous twists and surprises instead of a straight , tense roller-coaster such as this dark , violent road thriller where surviving seems impossible . Sure , the flick has some moments where logic seems to be in question , but the flick is so well made and the suspense and style so ratcheted up , I could forgive momentary lapses of realism . I'm not sure Hauer's killer could get away with the things he does against the police , and I'm pretty sure Howell's tormented hero would have a hard to eluding police . But , those questions merely entered my mind briefly as I just sat back and enjoyed the ride .
Vampyres	Two female bloodsuckers , seen murdered by a mysterious figure in black whose identity is never explained at the opening of the film , seduce travelers on a road that passes near their abode-of-the-moment , a decadent castle , isolated from the outside world thanks to a heavy presence of green ( trees and bushes ) resting at it's opening with only a path giving anyone an idea that something lives within . The castle is the very definition of secluded , and an ideal place for a vampire couple's lair . . particularly when they look as gorgeous as Fran ( Marianne Morris ) and Miriam ( Anulka Dziubinska ) . Ted ( Murray Brown ) , a mysterious man himself , who rudely shakes off a hotel employee who claims he's seen him before , becomes Fran's slave of lust . . unlike other males who follow the femme vamps to the castle , Fran spares Ted's life because she's perhaps in love with him . After rambunctious sex , Ted awakens the next morning , weakened hardly able to balance himself realizing a long gash on his arm , not to mention blood on the bed sheets . The gaping wound will be a small supply for Fran ( . . and sometimes Miriam ) for Ted finds himself unable to pull away from her . He's bewitched by Fran and remains a blood-drinking source for the vampires giving them nourishment when other horny males do not pass by their road . We are voyeurs into the world of Fran and Miriam and their selection process watching as they wrangle men with their feminine wiles and promises of sex . We are also eyes into their attacks on the victims , like rabid dogs as they stab and drink while the tortured souls succumb to blood loss and death . The film also follows a married couple , John ( Brian Deacon ) and Harriet ( Sally Faulkner ) who are on vacation , deciding the rest their camper within the castle's grounds not knowing what horrors lie in wait for them . One thing's for certain , as directed by José Ramón Larraz , the film doesn't go skimpy on what fans for erotic Euro-horror crave for , ultra-violence , nudity , and sex are in abundance . I felt the gaping wound on Ted's arm began to take the form of a female vagina as the vampires , over a period of time , feed from it . The castle setting really enriches the film and thanks to the splendid use of candlelight , many night time sequences ( . . of course , around Midnight is when the vampires bounce on their male victims , who are often overcome by drunkenness ) are particularly chilling . I love the claustrophobic confines of a wine cellar where the vampires house their Carpathian vintage , underneath the castle , led to by a long tunnel . My favorite scene , beside the shower Fran and Miriam take together , is the vampires attack on the wine connoisseur in the wine cellar . . it's quite a lengthily established sequence as they set him up by leading him to their special volume of wine . The attacks themselves are drenched in blood . . the victims covered in the red stuff as Fran and Miriam have at them passionately . The female leads really get into their vampire roles . The final twenty or so minutes become particularly blood-thirsty as Fran and Miriam go on a rampage slicing and drinking from several unfortunates . I'm not sure I understood how they become vampires , though . . their affliction and violent deaths by gunshots at the opening really doesn't get a necessarily good explanation as to how they became what they are . This is a film , though , that's more on style and image than substance . José Ramón Larraz certainly has talent and brings together some spooky exterior shots at night of the castle and the setting reeks of death and decay . Lots of lesbian activity not to mention some sexual interludes between Fran and Ted . And , Marianne Morris loves to remove her clothes slowly . . the camera loves her mysterious dark dark brown eyes . One might ponder why John and Harriet remain on the grounds for such a long period of time . . particularly when Harriet suspects Fran and Miriam of something as they stroll off into the distance before dawn . There's a really strange meeting that occurs between Fran and Harriet where the female bloodsucker speaks as if they had met before . . yet , this is never addressed in the film again . Some of these holes bothered me a bit but the overall experience was quite noteworthy . Fans of lesbian vampire flicks , in particular , should enjoy this one .
The Scarecrow reviews " The Frighteners "	Frank Bannister ( Michael J . Fox . . great as always ) has a good thing going with his partnership with two ghosts as they con poor innocents to " exorcise " and replenish homes of ghoulish forces . What Frank doesn't see coming is a grim reaper type taking should from humans . He can see what victims will be chosen next by way of a number that forms on their foreheads . The reason behind Frank's unique ability to see and communicate with ghosts who didn't " go into the light " is that he went through a devastatingly traumatic experience when his wife was killed in a car crash caused by something he can't recall . She was found with a number cut into her forehead for which Frank can not recall . Frank's life will change forever when he " exorcises " the home of Ray and Lucy Lynskey . He sees a number appear on Ray's forehead and Lucy remembers this when her husband is taken from her thanks to a cardiac arrest . Frank can now communicate with Ray and this brings him to Lucy . Her belief in Frank is his anchor when all hell breaks loose as death stalks his next victim . . Lucy ! The film might be very interesting for Peter Jackson completists desiring to sample earlier works before his " Lord of the Rings " films . This film marks his American debut and you can see Peter's ability to use computer visual effects in such harrowing and awe-inspiring ways . The ghosts and how they move { well , particularly death as he " moves " through walls and such within the house of a woman named Patricia who was the partner-in-crime with serial killer Johnny Charles Bartlett ( Jake Busey ) } are especially impressive . There's a major twist towards the end that is excellent and it deals with the identity of Death , the soul sucking reaper . Death's mission and a particular partner of his bring much suspense to the climax as Frank and Lucy must stop him at all costs . We watch as Frank tries to rescue humans before Death takes their souls and that also provides some thrilling moments . The whole film is one long wild roller-coaster as problems arise worse for Frank as he has a nemesis in an agent for the FBI named Milton Dammers . Dammers is at the brink of complete breakdown and we can see in how he approaches people & is effected by certain behaviors ( such as women screaming . . it ails him ) . Dammers has been a part of varying cults , working for the FBI , all his career and we see the horrors of this job etched in his entire being . Dammers has this will so strong it's boundless to put an end to Frank's practices . He uses Lucy in many ways to do just that . I feel Dammers is in this film mainly as a fork in the road to Frank and Lucy's quest to stop Death and there are many moments where he causes complete conflict . Combs plays him quite freakish and he's memorable in every scene he's in . Dee Wallace as Patricia stretches madness and terror , but this particular character is much more to the inner story of Death's quest than meets the eye . Jake has that sinister , twisted chagrin that works well in his scenes as Johnny , the killer . But , the film's dynamic is Fox's energy and Trini Alvarado's ( Lucy . . I couldn't take my eyes off her she's so beautiful ) serene face . . they gel so well in their scenes together . I do feel that many might look too hard at the angles regarding the abilities for people to jump in and out of death by unusual ways ( particularly Fox's hero . . his ability to do this might be a bit of a stretch ) , and one might could dissect how Death does what he does and how he does it . But , if you just go with it , I'm sure many horror fans will be very entertained .
Delirium	Psychosexual madness from director Renato Polselli regarding a psychotic impotent psychiatrist and his equally nutty wife who obsessively loves him to the point that she allows him to nearly strangle her to death ! Mickey Hargitay stars as Herbert Lyutak who preys on young women , his demented eyes crawling up their legs , crotches and necks until the urge to strangle them proves too great to resist . We see in an opening scene where he offers a young woman , barely past her teenage years , a ride home , stopping on the way , pursuing her as she runs for her life . Catching up to her , he bashes her with a branch , while gripping her throat tightly , ripping away her clothes , with a look of sheer rage on his face . . the inability to have sexual contact has created a madness beyond his control . We know right away what he's capable of . After this , he nearly murders his wife , Marcia ( . . the ridiculously sexy Rita Calderoni ) , who knows about his activities . Attempting to set himself up by tipping the police on alert for the perpetrator , someone else stabs a young woman in a telephone booth . Then , a whore , who was to be Herbert's target , gathers the knife used as the murder weapon wishing to talk to him , is drowned in the bathtub of her flat after being flogged repeatedly with a whip across the body . A suspect is a voyeuristic parking lot attendant , but he's merely an obvious red herring who actually eyewitnesses the Lyutaks ' maid being put to sleep by a suspect off-camera . Living with the Lyutaks is relative Joaquine ( Christa Barrymore ) who may in fact be Marcia's lover . All sorts of sleazy , sordid shenanigans are on display in this crazy , violent giallo with a cast who lets it all hang out , holding nothing back , their wacky characters unrestrained . Bulging eyes , rough sexual violence , and harsh behavior using all sorts of tools add to the devious fun . To enjoy this , you need to have a degree of tolerance towards tasteless acts and outbursts of insanity . Hargitay's eyes , how they chillingly stare down potential young victims , are certainly hard to forget , as are his treatments towards those unlucky ones he treats harshly . The real star is Calderoni , whose love-crazed wife harbours an unhinged passion for her man , and the film highlights certain bizarre sadomasochistic fantasies she has regarding her husband and those who live within their home . The violence isn't gory but uncomfortable to watch at times because it deals mostly with naked ( . . or skimpily clothed ) women being mistreated . Calderoni has quite a marvelous seductive presence and I couldn't take my eyes off of her . The mystery of who else , besides Hargitay , was killing , shouldn't be that hard to figure out . It's the outrageous behavior of the central characters which dominate this film . I watched the Italian version not the American one ( . . which alters the story regarding a violent tour through Vietnam which shaped Hargitay's dementia ) .
The Sniper	Eddie Miller ( Arthur Franz ) is a deeply disturbed man , whose psychiatrist was away for two weeks , can not control the urges pulsating inside him . After a self-inflicted hand burn on a stove eye , Eddie is the ultimate example of a cry for help . He himself wishes to be locked away before the drive to kill is realized yet when this doesn't happen many female victims will suffer for it . That uncontrollable monster inside springs forth meticulously as Eddie chooses women who fit the type that represents his mother , ambiguously hinted at briefly . When Jean Darr ( the great Marie Windsor ) , a bar pianist is assassinated , two San Francisco detectives , Lt . Frank Kafka ( Adolphe Menjou ) and Sgt Joe Ferris ( Gerald Mohr ) face the pressure of catching Eddie before more killings arise . Yet , this task isn't easy and when a third victim is a prominent society woman , the press and frightened public is breathing down the police's back to catch the sniper , who sits on top of buildings patiently awaiting the perfect shot . Eddie has a harsh criminal record including a nasty attack on a woman with a baseball bat . But , bit by bit Eddie makes little mistakes that will inevitably feed the police leads in catching up to him including an incident at a carnival . Surprisingly frank in a professional manner , addresses sexual deviancy preaching the word against allowing sex offenders and predators ( . . peeping toms , etc . ) on the streets so easily . The film is handled with kid gloves thanks to good direction by the reliable Edward Dmytryk and intelligent writing . We see how the public can not get enough of the case as people always rush to crime scenes and such trying to see for themselves Eddie's handiwork . Arthur Franz is quite good as the killer , showing the agony tormenting him . . that festering desire to kill etched on his face and in how he carries himself . We also see how the case takes it's toll on the detectives really mounted with pressure to find the assassin .
It's not a story , Alex . It's a corpse	Three flatmates offer a room to a dangerous thief who has ran off with a pair of gangsters ' loot . When they find this guy ( whose name is Hugo , claiming to be a writer ) dead from , I'm guessing , overdose , they chop up his body and bury it so they can share the money . Juliet ( Kerry Fox ) is a doctor whose uses her feminine whiles to pit " chartered accountant " David ( Christopher Eccleston ) & newspaper reporter Alex ( Ewan McGregor ) against each other as greed becomes a seducing emotion overwhelming all three . When Alex and Juliet go on a mild spending spree , David goes berserk , hiding the remainder of the cash up in the attic and hermits himself up there drilling holes in the ceiling so he can watch the other two intently . Soon , the gangsters find their flat , but David has completely turned a bit wacko awaiting them to enter his lair . What will ultimately push these three into complete turmoil is when the police start fishing . The film gets really grim as David never quite recovers from chopping up and burying Hugo's body ( he lost a " drawing of straws " ) . We see three people plotting against each other until certain violence erupts as paranoia and corruption come to the surface . We see right from the very beginning as these three are interviewing possible candidates for their flat how crude and rude they can be . It doesn't surprise that these supposed friends could harm each other over A LOT of mullah . I say that if you don't like dark , dark comedies where people turn on each other or change twistingly into a different person then stay away . It's visually exciting thanks to Boyles ' impressive camera-work and the writing is a psychologically nasty piece of work . One question that did poke around in my brain was why they just didn't divide the loot amongst themselves and remove any form of angst or aggression .
Almost Human	Sensational Poliziotteschi from Umberto Lenzi , set in Milan ( Italy ) stars Tomas Milian , in a terrific ( . . and terrifying ) performance as a sadistic homicidal thug who is the mastermind behind the kidnapping of a politician's daughter for a major ransom . His scheme seems to be going without a hitch , but his psychopathic tendencies can only continue for so long before he eventually hangs himself at some point . Henry Silva , intense and smooth as ever , is the detective out to catch him . Ray Lovelock and Gino Santercole are Milian's accomplices . The delectable Anita Strinberg has a small role as Milian's doomed lover , whose vehicle and sexual favors are used on a regular basis . The beautiful Laura Belli is the innocent kidnapped by Milian whose fate doesn't have a very promising outlook . Luciano Catenacci makes the most of a secondary role as a dangerous Milan mobster for whom Milian has worked for . . Milian's dealings with Catenacci have been worrisome affairs due to his violent and unpredictable nature ( . . not to mention Milian's screw-up during a planned heist when he murders a street cop in cold blood ) . Guido Alberti is the politician Milian wishes to milk for half a billion . Strinberg was an employee of Alberti , and Milian's idea just came about out of sheer desperation for some cash . Milian creates quite a frightening persona in his unhinged hood , always tearing into his bubble gum , twitchy and unstable . . the kind of character that is spontaneous and destructive . The opening car chase through Milan is riveting as the police chase after Catenacci's hoods with Milian in tow , when a bank robbery goes awry . Those that consider Lenzi an unaccomplished director should take a gander at ALMOST HUMAN , because the pacing is incredible as is the emphasis on moving the story along without unnecessary set-backs . Ernesto Gastaldi's unpretentious screenplay focuses on the plot while also providing the cast ( . . particularly Milian , Silva , and Lovelock ) with chances to further expand their characterizations . The film is ultimately a showcase for Milian because the story itself derives from his impulsive and criminal activity . . he is the source for all the horror that takes place throughout , the lightning rod if you will . The aftermath , once the money drop takes place , is certainly shocking , perhaps leaving a bad taste in your mouth , but it shows that Milian's scumbag is devoid of humanity , with no moral compass other than his own goal of attaining wealth through any means necessary without being caught . Following the DIRTY HARRY model , Silva soon realizes that he must take the law into his own hands since going by the book hasn't helped keep a murderer off the streets . . appropriately downbeat ending even after revenge was served because so many were left dead by Milian's deeds . The most unsettling sequence would have to be the result of a massacre at the hands of Milian who attacks a bourgeoisie gathering , with even a little girl being shot and killed ( . . the " roulette by chandelier " with two women hanging , with their breasts exposed , as Milian opens fire is rather horrifying ) .
Matango : Attack of the Mushroom People	Now this was quite a pleasant surprise . If you read the title , " Matango : Attack of the Mushroom People " , the idea of a film legitimately creeping you out with it's " under the skin " effectiveness probably wasn't as expected as a cheesy monster movie . This film's premise is simple . . a group of Japanese friends are on a yachting trip when their boat is viciously damaged by a major storm . They find , through a heavy fog , this island which has no known forms of life except growing mushrooms thereabouts and a massive derelict oceanographic ship overcome by moss and rot . There are some food rations and booze within that derelict ship , but a couple of the group steal more than their share . Soon , the relationships of these unfortunate souls deteriorate as hunger , jealousy , fear , and insanity overcome them . But , the deck becomes even more stacked when , one by one , each individual succumbs to the delicious mushrooms nearby the derelict and face the horrifying fact that in doing so , like a plague , their human bodies become ravaged internally which soon shows externally . . they , like others whose ships were caught in the current that affected our protagonists stranding them on the island , steadily grow into mushroom people ! The final climax as our hero , the professor , is trying to escape the clutches of these mushroom monstrosities ( . . the sound effects of echoing sinister laughter is eerie ) after his love-interest , a weak school clerk , is trapped within the lair of these creatures , is quite unsettling . Along with " Gojira " , this has to be considered director Ishirô Honda's finest hour . . he creates this incredibly disturbing experience that is hard to shake . I tried just to imagine the terrifying ordeal that would be if I were in that professor's shoes , trying to forge his way through the scary mushroom monsters closing in from every corner . I think the film , besides the mushroom monsters that rear their ugly heads at the end , works well at building the suspense thanks to this practically hopeless situation the characters find themselves in . . coupling that hopeless situation with a growing mistrust , anger & hidden feelings which come up to the surface away from their civilized world of modern Tokyo , as tension becomes so thick you can cut it with a knife and tempers flare quite often as pressure for survival squeezes them dry .
Nightmare	A teenage girl has an awful recurring nightmare of being trapped in an insane asylum cell with her sick mother who murdered dear old daddy on the poor child's birthday . Janet deeply fears of not only winding up at an asylum like in her nightmares , but the possibility of inheriting mother's murdering ways . Wishing to return home after staying at an all-girls private school , Janet ( Jennie Linden , who is indeed excellent as the traumatized girl ) is haunted by this woman with a slight scar on her face . Always trying to get away from her , this constant image of the woman laid on her back with a knife protruding from the chest lies at the heart of Janet's slow descent into madness . It all leads to the death of Janet's doctor , Henry's ( David Knight ) wife when she is a spitting image of the woman that haunts her nightmares . There's much more to this story than meets the eye , however , as we see that someone close to Janet was using her trauma as a weapon . Through Freddie Francis ' startlingly eerie , moody B & W photography , we see the nightmarish realm Janet's trapped in . It doesn't end there as the film takes a detour that can be a bit jarring at first , but comes together by the end . " Nightmare " is one of those films which starts out one place then takes the viewer into a totally different direction . This film is a lot of fun .
Rogue Cop	Cop-on-the-take Sgt Chris Kelvaney ( Robert Taylor ) vows to take down the two mob bosses , Dan Beaumonte ( George Raft ) & Ackerman ( Robert F Simon ) responsible for the death of his straight-arrow beat cop brother Eddie ( Steve Forrest ) . The drama starts when a lowlife named ' Wrinkles ' Fallon ( Peter Brocco ) kills a man in this gaming place . The man responsible for placing the ID on Fallon was Eddie who would receive a commendation for his work in bringing a killer to justice . But , Fallon is a photographer / blackmailer who captured Beaumonte and Ackerman snuffing someone out and he needs to be freed from jail or they take the fall . Beaumonte puts pressure on Chris to convince Eddie it's best not to keep his story on Fallon legit or else . But , Eddie is an honest product of his pop's raising and will not follow in his crooked brother's footsteps . Chris finds out that Eddie's new squeeze Karen ( Janet Leigh ) was once a mobster's moll from Florida and tries to convince her to talk sense into him against remaining loyal to keeping Fallon in prison . With Beaumonte and Ackerman squirmy and nervous about being taken down , they bring a foreign hit-man in to put away Eddie . Beaumonte has a lovely alcoholic moll Nancy ( Anne Francis ) who embarrasses him with her stumbling around and little jokes and cans her out on the street to another gangster for which she opens her mouth about certain things she knows . . Beaumonte now sets his sights on wringing her neck as well . Through it all , Chris will go rogue as his own as his superiors will desire his badge and resignation for his being under the mob's payroll , but not before he finds the man responsible for Eddie's death . He plans to not only take out the hit-man , but the two mob bosses as well in a climactic shootout with assistance of good cop Sidney ( Robert Ellenstein ) who feels resentment from the sergeant for not going the crooked route . Taylor gets a really juicy role as a crooked cop certainly a bit responsible for his brother's death . He has to face the music when it comes to his activities with the mob and this film puts it to him , but Taylor is good at getting sympathy from the viewer despite his nose-thumbing at being the honest , hard-working cop instead of getting paid , no matter who is forking over the extra salary lining your pockets . George Raft also is quite effective as a real scumbag mobster who says what he means , to the point with little in the way of small talk . Janet Leigh doesn't have to stretch too much . . it's her looks this film is aiming for . . that and to poke away at Chris ' heart . She's the one who he can speak to as the world caves in around him . . when both the police and the mob turn their cold shoulders to him . Sure , it's of his own making , but that's what makes the role so juicy for Taylor . . it's not black & white at all , but all sorts of shades of grey . The film is ultimately about redemption , setting things straight , and accepting the life you've lived with all the problems that capsize because of it . Anne Francis gets one of her best roles as a moll who genuinely loved her man and seems damned for pushing him too far .
The French Connection	Narcotics cops Popeye Doyle ( Gene Hackman ) and Buddy Russo ( Roy Scheider ) find themselves in a major sting operation of a major drug shakedown when it's discovered Sal Bocca ( Tony Lo Bianco ) , a drug-dealing virgin has formed a major coup with French drug-lord Alain Charnier ( Fernando Rey ) . In a sneaky trick , Charnier suckers a struggling actor , Henri Devereaux ( Frédéric de Pasquale ) into smuggling the heroine load in his car into New York . The film shows the extremely hard work Popeye and Buddy put in taking down this big operation . Yet , despite all the intense hard work and constant running around the city , Popeye sees the one he really wants , Chanier , slipping through his fingers . Powerful acting from Hackman with fine support by Scheider as his partner . Known , ad nauseum , for the car chase as Popeye drives through traffic ( . . and almost through innocent people , like a woman pushing a baby carriage ) to catch up with Charnier's right-hand assassin who almost sniper-kills him from a rooftop . The assassin takes over a subway car which Popeye must catch up to if he will not let the killer get away without paying for the death of an innocent woman standing in the way of a bullet meant for him . The location work in NYC gives the film a terrific authenticity that goes well with the narcotics sting taking place within .
Death Rides a Horse	Bill ( John Phillip Law , fashioned in a Clint Eastwood type of role ) watched as his father , mother and daughter were killed by a nasty band of vile criminals led by Walcott ( . . giallo and spaghetti western veteran , Luigi Pistilli ) . Ryan ( Lee Van Cleef ) has served a fifteen year prison sentence and is finally released , vowing revenge against his former partners in crime who betrayed him . Walcott and Burt Cavanaugh ( Anthony Dawson ) had sent paid guns to kill Ryan , but he was prepared for them . Seeking monetary funds for their betrayal , Ryan's plans are thwarted by Bill , now a skilled young gunslinger , who discovers where his enemies are . A reluctant partnership is forged between the two , each with their own agenda , often getting in the other's way , both with the same goal in mind . . making Walcott and his posse pay , and dearly . Of course , it won't be easy because Walcott is a wily , cunning bastard who has reborn himself a popular political figure in a small town , a ruse to steal a million dollars from their bank . One by one , Bill stares down his foes ( . . recognizing certain signs from memory , each member carrying something identifiable : a familiar face , a scar , an earring , a skull necklace , chest tattoo of four aces ) , the painful memory of his family's attack burning bright , the result being a gunfight which often doesn't end well for the opponents . Ryan , however , is the type of gunslinger with eyes in the back of his head , and understands the behavior of thieves and murderers . . his knowledge also derives from a life of crime . Before it's all said and done , Ryan can redeem himself for the part his gang played in the murders of Bill's family by helping the man square off with Walcott and the remaining hired guns in a showdown within the confines of Spanish village , engulfed in a dust storm . Lee Van Cleef , the western icon Hollywood gave up on , rides tall in the saddle once again , as the wise sharpshooting gunfighter who never misses and almost always outwits his foes . DEATH RIDES A HORSE is tailor made for Van Cleef , his squinty eyes always focused all around him . John Phillip Law receives a star-making role similar to Franco Nero , but his dubbed voice sounds as if he's attempting to evoke John Wayne . . to me , it never worked , and came off as very stiff . He's a talented gunfighter with marksman skill , but Bill often plays the patsy to Ryan whose experience gives him an edge . Director Giulio Petroni often mimics Sergio Leone's style , pulling the camera tight into faces , with accurately timed edits during shootouts . The zoom lens is used marvelously during the open slaughter of Bill's family , and the way Petroni's camera captures the items that he memorizes splendidly sets up the eventual showdowns with his enemies . The climactic gun battle between Bill and Ryan against Walcott and his men is well staged and action packed . The revenge story isn't anything new , but the vibrant direction makes up for any familiarity regarding a young man avenging the senseless murder of his entire family . And , the chemistry of Van Cleef and John Phillip Law is a valuable asset to the film , as they always seem to save the other's hide during key moments in the film . Leone standout Luigi Pistilli makes a memorable villain with his menacing face , a treacherous scoundrel you love to hate . Ennio Morricone provides yet another rousing , harmonious score that builds action / dramatic scenes majestically .
I'm 33 years old . . and I'm dying .	The Earl of Rochester ( Johnny Depp , in his finest performance I believe ) is invited back from being banished in the country by Charles II ( Malkovich , very effective as the long-nosed King ) to London where he begins where he left off . . embellishing himself with women , wine , and the theater . Charles allows the burden of such a troubled genius because of his intellect and amusing banter when it doesn't sink it's fangs too deep . Unfortunately , his willingness to submerge himself into depravity will destroy him . He really isn't a very happy man and his pleasuring purge is a way of drowning out such sorrow . When he takes on an understudy , Lizzy ( Samantha Morton , a bit too theatrical ) to show her the proper way to exude her true talents in her performances on stage , Earl falls madly in love with her . It awakens something within , a passion for life that isn't there when he is home with his gorgeous wife , Elizabeth ( Rosamund Pike ) . When he pulls one prank too many ( a hilariously perverse play for a French man of great importance that Charles wishes to impress for money his country has a lack of consisting of dildo's and the Earl himself dressed to the nines exactly as his King in a form of mockery ) his life descends into disease and poverty . His body ravaged with pox and his face overwhelmed with horrible diseased scarring . . his nose needs a silver covering while he can barely walk , hobbling everywhere he goes . He would lie dead , a shell of what he once was , at age 33 . The film doesn't judge John Wilmot , but certainly shows who he was and the film is frank in dialogue how he spoke . He followed the wants of the flesh despite the feelings of his God-fearing mother or his dutiful wife who took and took without anything given back to her . Wilmot was kept by Charles because of his abilities , but even those become futile as he slowly washes out reality with the alcohol he consumes . Though , the film is fascinating to me because of Johnny Depp's performance . Depp is enigmatic and Rochester . . he held my interest the entire time . The film is directed by a hand-held which may drive purists batty who are used to period pieces being lensed in a slick pattern . The director here seems to what to bring an ugliness and poverty-stricken feel to Charles ' land at this point and time . . by having the camera move , even at times where the camera seems to be held by some amateur using his camcorder taping live events from the 1800's , we feel like we're actually nearby watching Rochester ruin his life as a voyeur . I always felt that is why directors of today like to binge on the hand-helds . They want to bring a personal feel to the viewer as if we are placed right within the action of that moment . I liked the use of this device in this film , not to mention the " dirty " cinematography so many critics fussed about . I like that the film shows the period as ugly and deformed as Rochester becomes . But , without Depp's giving his all to this character , showing him with all the faults and loss , the film wouldn't be as successful as I thought it was .
He Walked by Night	A thief and psychopath named Martin ( portrayed with diabolical accuracy by an excellent Richard Basehart ) , murders a cop without compassion when caught breaking into a store . This sets off a massive investigation to find Martin and it hits pitfalls along the way as their suspect is crafty and intelligent . What makes it especially hard for police and detectives is Martin hasn't any prior convictions and has a keen ability to stay very well to himself . His mistake was trying to sell a certain specific piece of equipment to an electronics man and then his attempt to exhort moneys from him later on . After paralyzing a detective who was staking out the electronic man's place of business , Martin begins holding up several establishments such as liquor stores for cash . Despite various disguises , the police assemble the people robbed together and are able to put their suspect's face to paper which helps the investigative team search more properly . Sgt . Marty Brennan ( Scott Brady ) is removed from the case by his Captain , but begins working undercover to sniff out the possible past of his suspect trying to find that key lead that will cause a domino effect leading to the capture of the murderer . The film is a matter-of-fact thriller , shot is gritty black and white , very dependent on narration for supplying us with questions on why this man would commit his evil crimes and how he could react with such little remorse for those he harmed . The narrative device also serves as a tool for explaining key elements in the plot . We get both sides : the point of view from both Martin and how he prepares & the law enforcement procedure at trying to get him . I believe a key to the film's success is the " boy-next-door " youthfulness of Basehart who doesn't have a face of a cold blooded killer until it twists in rage and we the unmasking of the true monster . But , the film is most importantly a study in how to catch a man who is so elusive that it takes much heartache and headache to catch him . The film's presentation is as cold as ice , like the killer , but is fascinating to see unfold over the duration . The final chase through the sewers is very reminiscent of Carol Reed's " The Third Man " , but was actually made a year prior to that famous film . " He Walked by Night " is a fine film brought to life by a good filmmaker .
Short Night of Glass Dolls	American journalist , Gregory Moore ( Jean Sorel ) is found supposedly dead and when taken to the hospital is pronounced just that . No sign of life is shown , but we the viewer hear his thoughts as he wonders why he can not move . As his body is moved to the morgue , his memory unravels bit by bit , as we often see fragments of unknown faces followed by long passages which show his life before this nightmare of paralysis . Gregory is an unpopular journalist in Prague who finds contempt ( . . and vice versa ) for the police there . When his beloved Mira ( the stunning Barbara Bach ) disappears when he leaves to visit his partner , Gregory decides to investigate and uncovers some sordid , scary things along the way . His former lover , and journalist , Jessica ( Ingrid Thulin ) wishes he would cease his persistent search for the truth as he often finds himself with problems concerning the police who wishes him to halt so that they can do their jobs . Soon , contacts who might have information concerning a certain Klub 99 , ran by Dr . Valinski ( José Quaglio ) the director of the prestigious establishment consisting of old politicians and doctors , are being killed and the police suspect Gregory was behind it . Perhaps something sinister lies within the curtained rooms of Klub 99 , but how can Gregory expose it if laying with the appearance of death on a gurney ? Will Gregory be able to receive any motory function within his body and limbs in time or become a specimen of study for students in an anatomy class ? Well developed , mystery-driven giallo with stunning use of locations . It seems politically motivated as well perhaps making a statement against secret societies doing harm to others . Gialli fans expecting the usual stabbings and ultra-violence may find this dull because it's more story-oriented as we watch a creepy situation unfold . But , the idea of our protagonist's not being able to speak out as his body is being examined because of rigormortis not setting ( nifty idea so that the story can progress also providing hope to the viewer that he might be saved from the mortician's scalpel ) also adds suspense to the already plot-heavy story in Gregory's memory . Add the piercing score which also weighs the extra tension on the viewer and you have an effective thriller .
Funeral Home	Teenager Heather ( Lesleh Donaldson ) moves in with her devoutly religious grandmother Maude Chalmers ( Kay Hawtrey in a terrific performance ) who , along with her absent husband , once ran their place as a funeral home , now starting up a tourist bed'n'breakfast for visitors in town . Heather soon discovers her grandma chatting it up with someone in the cellar , or so she believes . Maude forbids her passionately to stay out of the cellar , and has it's door pad-locked . Heather begins dating a local , Rick ( Dean Garbett ) who informs her of sordid details regarding her grandfather which she initially rejects angrily , but , over time , begins to question her grandmother's story of what happened to him . Rick's brother , newly hired Deputy Joe ( Alf Humphreys ) has been investigating a rash of disappearances plaguing his small town , against his sheriff's ( Robert Warner ) wishes , and soon realizes that those missing connect to Maude's tourist locale . A customer of Maude's , Mr . Davis ( Barry Morse ) , is also pursuing the disappearance of his wife , who was rumored to be the lover of the missing Mr . Chalmers , as he often reports to Joe on any information which might become available . When a visiting salesman and his mistress , using Maude's place as a refuge for their affair , wind up dead thanks to a mysterious truck driver who pushes their car over a cliff surrounding a watering hole , and Davis , whose snooping leads to a difficult confrontation with Mrs . Chalmers , suffers himself a grim fate , it's only a matter of time before the secret of the cellar becomes known . Through the developing mystery of director William Fruet and writer Ida Nelson , the film gives us subtle hints over time as to who might be behind the murders / disappearances . Throughout , we get facts about the main character unseen , the missing husband , and bit by bit everything falls in place leading to quite a suspenseful conclusion as Heather and Rick find themselves in danger as the ax-wielding nutcase in the cellar rears his / her face for the first time . The ending might not be a major surprise to those familiar with Psycho as the twist is eerily similar in psychological content to Hitchcock's masterpiece . It's still a doozy and I wish I could define how neat it is regarding the performance of the cellar psychopath , but I wouldn't dare spoil how it unfolds . Kay Hawtry is the whole show and displays with her face and demeanor a wealth of various emotions , especially when anyone approaches the subject of her husband and the cellar . Besides the ending , her reaction to Morse's amateur sleuth is a definite highlight . Donaldson was a perfect protagonist , the teenager blossoming into a woman , displaying her as mature , conflicted ( . . because she loves her grandmother and worries about her , not at all responding well to the supposed gossip regarding her grandfather ) , and scared . Stephen E Miller is memorable as a lurking handyman peeping tom , rather dumb and creepy , often spying on people in the bushes around Mrs . Chalmers ' place , or popping up on Heather as she snoops around trying to uncover mysteries that are bothering her concerning a history uncertain to her . The house at night and where it's located ( . . in the boonies surrounded by rural wilderness with country roads leading to a minor little town with people who have known each other forever ) are used rather well . And , the black cat Heather is frightened of is of major importance to the plot . . it's a clever plot-device who sees a great deal and will lead others to the film's secret . Great scene where a body is discovered by a local girl swimming underwater in the watering hole nearby Mrs . Chalmer's place .
Frankenhooker	A employee of a New Jersey power company plays mad scientist in his spare time . At his future father-in-law's birthday barbecue , his newly invented remote-control lawnmower chops his girlfriend to bits spreading her throughout the yard like a " salad . " You have to see the news report and hear their colorful description of the girl's demise ( . . as a gag , director Henelotter had actress Patty Mullen dress in a fat suit that made her hips wide ) ! Anyway Jeffrey Franken wink ( played by James Lorinz , whose cracking wise in " Street Trash " put him in hot water with his mobster employers ) keeps the remaining parts of what was his lady , Liz , in a special solution he created in a freezer ( . . including her head , for which he often communicates with , while also placing photos of her face on all types of inanimate objects like naked girl photos and model skeletons ) . . he needs to form a plan to return his lady-love to life .

When the hookers go berserk after finding some unusual bagged crack in Jeff's doctor case , and subsequently smoke his entire stash , they explode with fireworks going off ! Zorro , growing restless , moves upstairs to see why his ladies have stayed past their amounted time , and gets knocked unconscious by a flying head ! No sh ! t ! I think you can guess what follows . . it plays off the FRANKENSTEIN formula , but this " bride " turns tricks with a vagina that sends bolts through her clientèle ! Patty Mullen is a hoot as Liz , certainly as she walks down those Jersey streets , with her head and face jerking into ugly contortions as the limbs placed on her have a will / desire of their own ! To some it's crap , for others it's gold . . Henenlotter has proved that there's no boundaries he isn't willing to cross . The prosthetic body parts are never convincing . . I felt that Henenlotter probably said , " Screw it . I'm working with peanuts , and those who like this film won't care about that anyway . " I would say my favorite scene has nothing to do with Liz or the hookers , but a small one containing a scene-stealing Louise Lasser ( I loved her in Woody Allen's Bananas ) as Jeff's mom . I love the way she timidly knocks on his door and enters his room . She carries this worried look of concern on her face and is completely oblivious of the fact that mama's little boy is a wacko . When he informs her that he might have fallen into a moral abyss , unable to distinguish right from wrong , good from evil , she dead-pans , " Would you like a sandwich ? " The ending , where the hooker body parts " revolt " against their pimp Zorro and how Liz " rescues " Jeff from certain oblivion , must be seen to be believed . There's a strange place Henenlotter taps into . . a crazy-house inside him , if you will . . where a plethora of twisted ideas spring from . You just can't straight-jacket such a director whose resume includes a tale of " brotherly love " ( . . between a young man and his deformed " twin " brother he keeps in a wicker basket ) and a " drug parable " regarding a young man's descent when a creature offers him a hallucinogenic fluid directly fed into his brain . Demented , perverse , crude & absurd . . yep , I dug " Frankenhooker . "
The Naked City	How stolen jewelry leads to murder of a blond model named Jean in The Big Apple . The film is an exciting step-by-step methodical police procedural with Det Lt . Dan Muldoon ( the simply wonderful Barry Fitzgerald ) and Det Jimmy Halloran ( Don Taylor ) on the case . They find this particular case , however , quite a pain as many leads go sour as they search for the truth regarding the unfortunate death of such a beautiful young woman . It all leads to Frank Niles ( Howard Duff ) , quite the hunky ladies ' man who has secrets that Muldoon and Halloran have to find out . While it does lay the melodrama a bit thick at times , with hammy narrative by the film's producer ( perhaps worked well at that time , but really annoyed me ) , the exciting cinematography of NYC , captures the immediacy of solving a case lead-to-lead . I loved the use of New York City in how director Dassin captures time and place with the flowing of public . It's fun seeing the detective work in such a vast steel jungle where there are plenty of places to hide . I love the way the film shows chases amongst crowds of people . Stunning to behold with solid pacing . One can't help but look at this as the perfect model for how cop movies and shows have worked for so long .
Tale of a Vampire	Alex ( Julian Sands ) , a vampire who often frequents a library , finds that a newly hired clerk , Anne ( Suzanna Hamilton ) resembles a long lost love , Virginia , sparking up a desire for relations with her . A mysterious intruder named Edgar ( Kenneth Cranham ) who persuasively ignites dinner conversations with Anne , attempts to warn her of Alex , because she indeed is attracted to him . There are unresolved deaths plaguing the London streets , and we watch as Alex pursues his victims , unable to halt the blood thirst his nature so requires . More of a doomed Gothic romance set in gloomy modern London where the fog still lives and breathes at night as Alex stalks the streets for his prey , and his feeding can be quite messy . I fell in love with how director Shimako Sato builds the mood of this tale , using blue , the way light is reflected and produced , rain , graffiti walls , the crumbling walls of Alex's dilapidated dwelling , & various other London locales which seem the perfect background of our vampire's existence and anguish . Sands , who facial features and hanging shoulders has him resembling a droopy lost puppy seeking refuge and a kind heart , I thought was perfect in the lead as Alex . I also liked how Sato often captures Sands , quietly emerging from a dark corner . . while quite a sympathetic figure thanks in part to Sands work , he's also a brooding menace . I've always liked those vampire tales which display a lonely figure , melancholy , yearning for someone taken away , whose craving for human blood is so insatiable he's almost beast-like . I think that works well in this film . . showing how Sato's camera seductively captures Sands ' , a handsome smallish man , whose not all that imposing , turn savage when it's time to feed , such as one scene where he throws a victim up against a wall , crushing his skull , lifting the poor soul above him with blood scattering throughout his face and lips . Another scene shows Alex caressing a wayward cat before sinking his teeth into it's furry neck . We even get a dream sequence where Alex is drinking the blood from Anne's cut finger , as he plunges on top of her , biting into her neck , drinking her blood . Cranham as Edgar is scholarly while quite imposing and straight-forward , often abrupt while also , at the same time , keeping secrets with a darkness behind his eyes . Even when Edgar informs Anne of who Alex really is , it seems like an agenda is always present as if this air of animosity drives / motivates him . Who Edgar really is heightens the despair and angst of Alex's loneliness . I felt Hamilton provides a moving performance as Anne ( . . and Virginia ) using subtlety instead of melodramatics . Like Alex , Anne is a lonely-heart as well , having lost someone dear to her as well . The idea of having someone you love snatched away and the fear of dying , yet living all alone are themes I felt really make this film work well . Not critically acclaimed , I think it's one hell of a vampire film .
Rambo	The synopsis is simple . A repulsive , completely evil militant group of Burmese soldiers are wiping out innocent Karen villages with Christian leanings . A small group of missionaries desire to boat to a specific village to help the lives of the people there . Rambo , now a snake wrangler and boatman , is asked to take them to the village . He reluctantly does . The village is attacked by the Burmese hyenas who take the missionaries prisoner . The Colorado pastor finds that his missionaries haven't returned , commissions mercenaries to find them . Rambo agrees to take the mercenaries to where the missionaries were dropped off . With resistance , at first by the mercenaries , Rambo soon ( . . thanks to his impressive use of a bow and arrows ) is leading a charge into the jungle to save the missionaries that are under capture . Doing so , a battle begins with Rambo and the mercenaries shooting it out with the Burmese scum . Bodies are blown to smithereens by constant weapon-fire , with Rambo getting to use a new blade fashioned through fire . Truly one of the most violent films I've ever seen , and I watch a lot of horror movies . I had read previously about how violent this was , but seeing it with my own eyes brings truth to what has been written and spoken . The machine guns used do serious damage to bodies in this movie . Bodies are literally blown to pieces with limbs flying skyward and blood splattering . The climactic battle even shows heads being taken off and a man's stomach torn open with the guts spilling out . But , bullet-riddled bodies are a constant in this actioner . Not for the faint of heart . The film attempts somewhat , when people aren't getting annihilated , to shed light on the Burmese situation . The massacre / slaughter of the Karen village is horrifying . . women and children are shot point-blank and Sly as director rarely pulls a punch . The rapes and humiliation of innocent young women aren't as elaborated on , but we get an idea of what the Burmese soldiers do to them . Like in Rambo-First Blood Part II , this film has rainy night scenes where John , and his mercenaries sneak into the village to retrieve captured prisoners . During this , Rambo actually rips a soldier's throat out . Pure bloody carnage , once the violence begins , it hardly lets up . The film even has Rambo igniting an old WWII dummy bomb with a major explosion taking out a large portion of jungle with John barely escaping . And , we get to see what mines do to both innocent Karen prisoners and soldiers ' bodies . This is not a film for critics . The film is mostly a pure action film where there isn't any gray area . . it's good vs . evil and we have identifiable heroes to root for and villains to boo . And , the violence is gratuitous and startlingly realistic . I recommend watching the behind the scenes special features on the newly released DVD just to see how painstakingly difficult it was to make this film .
The Resurrected	Private detective John March ( John Terry ) is hired by a beautiful client , Claire ( Jane Sibbett ) concerned about her husband Charles Dexter Ward ( Chris Sarandon , yet again perfectly cast ) who has removed himself from her life almost completely , secluding himself from their cottage miles away in his ancestral home of Joseph Curwen , a person known for toying with witchcraft . Encountering a curiously declining Charles , speaking with an unusual grammar and an unusual Asian who speaks no English , within the Curwen home , March and Claire know something is amiss . Claire , truly worried about her husband's mental health , agrees to have Charles committed . Searching through the underground catacombs beneath Curwen's home , the mysteries regarding bringing the dead back to life are discovered . But , not just notes and written papers acknowledging this , but pits containing " failed experiments " revealing a monstrous secret hidden away from civilization . Yet , something is on the rampage throughout Rhode Island eating residents . When a suitcase carrying bones is opened by March , he truly understands who Charles really is . . . or , more importantly , who is carrying on a charade pretending to be Charles . Shamefully neglected ( . . I myself only found out about it thanks to an Internet pal from Belgium ) gem has to be considered one of the best horror films adapted from a Lovecraft tale . The gore effects of the monsters in the pits within the catacombs , bodies " re-birthed " , and two bodies being " spliced together " are amazing to behold thanks to good ole fashioned make-up wizardry . Old school special effects , made by the hands of craftsman , are certainly appreciated by yours truly , and director Dan O'Bannon brings to life quite a stunning horror film . Not just the effects , but how he photographs the film through his energetic camera-work , smooth story-telling , and a wonderful unveiling of the mystery as it builds ( . . what " Charles " was up to , hidden away as a private dick learns of the horrifying details unfolding everything to the viewer ) inside the darkened tunnels where you never know what lurks around the corner or in the next room , O'Bannon deserves more respect from fans . . this is a film that should be re-discovered and appreciated . Great finale in a padded cell where March confronts " Charles " and faces grave danger , just adds to the grisly goodies of this superb thriller . And , Richard Band's score only adds to the film's many attributes . For once , I don't think Lovecraft wasn't spinning in his grave . .
Alice , Sweet Alice	The tragic murder of a little girl , Karen ( Brooke Shields , who was just an adorable child ) before receiving her communion powerfully opens this horror film about a killer donning a yellow raincoat and children's mask . The film immediately points towards Alice ( Paula Sheppard , who is quite creepy . . her image in the closing frame gave me goosebumps ) who was quite jealousy of Karen's attention regarding her communion . We see Alice mistreating her in various ways like locking Karen up in the room of an abandoned , condemned building . Alice clearly loathes Karen for she's the beautiful one others gravitate towards . We see Alice's really dark side particularly around the obese , disgusting landlord , Alphonso ( Alphonso DeNoble ) with a number of cats in his apartment while also sporting a urine stain on his undies . She explodes with these rude , crude , often bluntly profane comments that show this nasty side . Obviously , Alice's mother , Catherine ( the lovely Linda Miller ) can not believe her daughter would commit such an act such as killing Karen . But , when someone attacks Cat's sister Annie ( Jane Lowry in a memorable , short role ) quite an overbearing wretch who orders her meek husband around , Alice really becomes the prime suspect . She was in the general area where Annie was brutally stabbed , has a yellow raincoat and mask that matches the description the psychopath wears . Even worse is the fact that Annie believes Alice did it . But , when Alice is currently being under observation by psychiatric help , the killer strikes Dominick ( Niles McMaster ) . . Cat's estranged husband and Alice's father in a terrifying , but truly unforgettable sequence . When we get a look at who is behind the killings , the film notches up the suspense for this person has masked his ( her ) self quite well within the Catholic community . Fantastic low-budget slasher flick grips from the moment it starts thanks to an ominous build that doesn't let go . The creepy performance from Sheppard , the authentic , excellent use of New Jersey locations , the magnificent photography , and disturbing knife attacks create such a chilling experience . Mildred Clinton has a haunting role as Mrs . Tredoni , the housekeeper of Priest Father Tom ( Rudolph Willrich ) who plays a crucial part in the story . Elements such as the sins of a mother , Catholic guilt , the loss of a child , communion , & just the way Catholicism plays a heavy symbolic hand are important to the reasons behind the sadistic killer's motives . The image of the yellow raincoat and children's mask really only adds to unsettling kill-sequences of the psycho .
The Dark	I got existential with this film . It reminded me greatly of " The Blair Witch Project " where we see these characters unknowingly entering certain horror . . we know what will happen , but they have no idea what certain doom they willingly will be entering . You can not fault anyone but one and that is the guide who takes them into an " undiscovered " tavern ; that would be Juno ( Natalie Jackson Mendoza ) . The others believe they are taking a trip into a known cavern , and the fun of entering is very lively on their faces . These thrill-seekers have did all sorts of wild things such as rafting down rough currents over dangerous rocks . . but those experiences won't even compare to what waits for them in the dark . We see these young women leaving their off-road vehicles just like those three documentarians about to enter in the woods of Burkettsville , but they will enter a whole other territory where you can not see the sky above . Sarah ( Shauna Macdonald ) is the main character of the film for we see what has occurred to her already . Sarah is indeed a tragic character we can latch onto for her husband and daughter were taken from her in an awful car crash . We see the dreams of watching Sarah's daughter blowing out the candles of a birthday cake . . this would never happen , but it provides peace when there isn't much in reality . One might ask what the point of this is , but it matters more when one views director Marshall's bleak ending to this film . Sarah follows her supposed guide into what she believes to be a friendly cavern , but never realizes what she will become during that very trip inside a completely different cavern than she was led to believe . This film shows a sign mid-way as the girls encounter a major problem . They follow a small passageway further into the cavern . When that hole caves in , the girls must find another exit . Once they discover Juno's secret of being closed in a supposedly uncharted cavern , that's when the terror of being trapped starts to swim deep in their minds . That feeling of hopelessness increases when they discover something sinister awaits them as they continue . They will find that this cavern has lots of paths that stop at deep drop-offs where they will have to rope-climb to get from one place in the tavern to another . . it's the only way if they seek to find an exit . Once they begin to rope across from one place to get to the other side , there's a grave discovery . . someone had once been in the cave when they find a rope-locking device attached in the rock ! They are not the first to have been in this cave and the device they find is over 100 years old ! Soon , the true horror begins as they travel inside this portion of the tavern and encounter creatures that seem human , but act anything but . They have the appearance of a possible species of bat . They can only detect movement with sound . They don't seem to have the ability to smell or see . That may be any of the women's only way of combating the evil that longs for their flesh . Yes , these creatures are meat eaters ! And , when they eat , they enjoy it with a feverish intensity . Marshall's film is as grim as grim can be . If one group of climbers couldn't make it out , why should the ones we watch escape ? There's a glimmering hope when Juno , amongst any that survive the initial carnage that occurs as the creatures run amok on them out of nowhere , finds markings perhaps telling them a possible way out . But , they would have to make it past those creatures which may not have certain senses available , but do move fast and seem to know how to climb all around the tavern . I started thinking about these women who are not victims by choice because they trusted Juno for whom seemed somewhat trustworthy before this situation . I tried to understand their terror . That hopelessness ran deep within me because these unfortunates have been placed in a dire state with little chance of survival .
School of the Holy Beast	Boy , this sure doesn't hold back when casting a scathing view of the Catholic church . No stone is unturned . Everything is in this film . Duck for that kitchen sink because the hypocrisy and secrets hidden within the abbey of the church of nuns examined here is riddled with sin and deprivation . The kick is that , through Norifumi Suzuki's magnificent direction , this isn't just a cheapo exploit flick , but a legit art film . The film's protagonist , Maya , to me isn't very different that Nami , the Scorpion in the Female Prisoner film , except she infiltrates a dirty convent seeking answers regarding her mother's fate within the confines of what was supposed to be a religious community of believers . Where a dirty cop is behind the ills of Nami , a bitter priest , Father Kakinuma ( Fumio Watanabe ) is the man responsible for what ails Maya . The Priest and the Vice Abbess , a woman seething with lust running through very loins . The fact is this flick exposes the ugly truth of what could occur behind the closed walls of a hidden place secretively inactive from the outside world . Here's this modern girl , Maya ( the yummy Yumi Takigawa ) who we see enjoying the pleasantries of life before entering the repressed innards of a community harboring hidden immorality under a cloak of righteousness . She is the offspring of that very lust and sin that lies quietly buried underneath the cloak , and through her , will those iniquities be exposed . Though , when you threaten to expose hidden dirty old secrets , there are bound to be consequences . Her very life will be threatened by not only the Vice Abbess , but a " witch-finding nun " sent into the convent by Kakinuma to put an end to a thorn in his flesh which could finally awaken the monster he really is . Kakinuma is quite a character . . hidden underneath bushy long hair and thick mustache , not to mention this cloak which removes our eyes from a horrifying act that occurred from the past , is this menacing quiet beast who seems to be a loving man of God who any nun or God-fearing Christian could confide in when dealing with problems of the flesh , is , himself , holding rather unpleasant feelings toward everyone including the Lord he serves . He seeks answers from God ( " Where is God when man needs him ? " ) while constantly bedding nuns who revere him . What sins are hidden within this convent : lesbian lovers keeping their love-making secret from everyone , a Mother Superior who confiscates sex photos she masturbates to , nuns who enjoy the sight of women being whipped ( director Suzuki often pulls his camera in on their faces as they look on wide-eyed with enthusiasm ) , the persecution room ( readily used such as the case when Maya is being tortured with thorny vines twisting around her body , piercing her flesh as a nun on each side pulls with all their might ) , a nun who stole money from the Vice Abbess so that she could pay for her father's hospital bills for which she receives a rape from Kakinuma , etc . The torture scene where Maya is being treated to thorny rose vines is rather hard to watch as director Suzuki tightens the camera on how they slide back and forth underneath her breasts . But , what follows is actually both unpleasant and beautiful . . the nuns collectively slap Maya across the face with bouquets of roses as Suzuki shows her face whipping to and fro in slow motion as petals fall poetically like snow around her body . It's quite a feat to create such a scene which can alternately compel and repel . And , that whipping scene , the first one inside the infamous persecution room , is amazingly photographed as Suzuki's camera goes berserk following the action as the two nuns , caught by a spy , eating sausages . The most horrific sequence in the film , the witch-trial of a pregnant nun , who was raped by Kakinuma , is quite a dazzling moment in the film . We see her agonizingly put through the ringer , whipped with blood stripes opening on her skin , salt water poured in her mouth ( . . forced to swallow an entire pail ) , and held inside a chair as the clock ticks with this container under her legs ( with a gold crucifix at it's center ) ready for urine to flow . If she urinates , this poor soul will be condemned as a witch . Not just your run-of-the-mill nunsploit , although I'm not an expert in the subversive sub-genre , I'd be hard-pressed to expect another to be any better than this one . Lots of breasts exposed as well as unceasing stabs at Catholicism . . . there's a vehement anti-Catholic attitude that permeates throughout and use of Christian iconography ( the use of a crucifix to kill , the destruction of a Virgin Mary statuette , blood puddling down a portrait of THE LAST SUPPER ) in exploitive ways . Certainly not for all tastes . . some will find this film very offensive . Maya , an unshakable force to be reckoned with , will unleash her revenge on those responsible for her mother's demise .
Violent Cop	How apt the film's title really is ! A blood feud enrages when a detective and drug lord's assassin lock horns . Corruption is plaguing the police force as Azuma's ( Beat Yakeshi ) colleague , Iwaki ( Sei Hiraizumi ) , is helping deal drugs for a drug lord , Nito ( Ittoku Kishibe ) Nito's assassin , Kiyohiro ( Hakuryu ) is targeted by Azuma because Iwaki is found hanging from a bridge by his neck through a noose . Azuma soon frames him with planted drugs , locks him in a room at the police station where he batters the man , even almost putting a bullet in him . Losing his job as a cop , Azuma is attacked from behind by the assassin with a cat-and-mouse ensuing with the result being an obvious bloody showdown . Director Kitano's amazing debut certainly echoes Dirty Harry in Azuma's unorthodox methods of handing out justice . Except Kitano's detective often obtains information through beating those he interrogates senseless . Usually , though , the ones he smacks around deserve a bit of punishment for their thuggish behavior & criminal activities . In one scene , Iwaki is trying to smooth things over between a gigolo and a girl he got pregnant ( . . for whom he also physically abuses ) . . in typical Azuma fashion , the detective beats the gigolo up right in the hallway of the police precinct ! One of my favorite scenes concerns a drug pusher with info Azuma needs regarding who he's selling dope for , in the bathroom of a discotheque . . Azuma continues to repeatedly slap this joker until the guy finally cracks revealing the drug lord as a restaurateur named Nito . What I found most fascinating was just how the assassin Kiyohiro and Azuma are similar . They are actually , in my opinion , cut from the same cloth , just on opposing sides of the law . Both carry themselves without fear of what lies in front of them . . with a cold , steely expression , the two exact punishment to those that oppose them . One , Azuma , uses violent methods to extract the information he needs or to put a person in their place . The killer , Kiyohiro , dutifully removes the thorns from his employer's side . Neither flinches when facing an obstacle or opponent and will hurt you bad if need be . But , both men have a hair trigger and are easily willing to wipe somebody out . It's appropriate that the cop will lose his job and go vigilante as it seems both he and the assassin are fated to meet in a gunfight to the death . Almost like the OK Coral is the vehicle lot where these two stare down each other before the shooting begins . The film has moments of startling violence interspersed with subtle humorous touches of Azuma and his faithfully law-abiding , naive partner , Kikuchi ( Makoto Ashikawa ) . Kikuchi , appears anyway , to be very by-the-book , patiently dealing with his often unhinged partner who can uncork at any moment stomping a suspect or insider who knows something of importance regarding their case . One particularly breathtaking sequence involves the chase of a criminal with information on drugs running throughout the city , after bashing and killing a police officer over the head with a baseball bat . Azuma , unflinchingly , runs him over with the car he's driving ! If you are familiar with Beat's characters in films , his cop is the same . A stone face hiding the obvious emotions present inside , unshakably like an impenetrable rock , his cop uses blunt force to speak for him . Sure a smile cracks every once in a while , mostly at his partner's ways , but Azuma buries most of what other cops wear on their sleeve . There's a scene I found amusing where Azuma is told he's fired as the detective stares down his chief without batting an eyelash with the camera lingering on him seemingly forever . The opening of the film really sets the tone for how our " hero " works as a police officer . . a group of mean kids harm a beggar on a street corner minding his own business . Azuma follows one of them to his home . He invites himself in to the kid's house to his mom's bewilderment . And , Azuma subsequently smacks the kid around telling the brat to turn himself in ! Something I also found amusing was how Azuma almost always walks . . everywhere , it seems , in this film he's trotting to this or that destination on foot . The film also shows another problem Azuma has to deal with . . a mentally retarded sister who doesn't turn away from men wanting sex , and we see what her brother does to one fellow who took advantage of her , getting thrown down the steps , his body pouring into the street as Azuma slaps the back of his head , kicking his shin as both men walk to a bus stop . When Kiyohiro kidnaps her , getting the poor girl hooked on heroine , Azuma's decision regarding her need for a fix is truly haunting . Like most of Kitano's future characters , whose lives revolve around crime , his violent cop here is a doomed character fated for only one certain outcome . Also , this film cleverly shows that even if one major crime lord is removed by deadly means , there's always another waiting to take his position . . and that goes for corrupt cops as well .
The Face of Another	Disturbing portrait of a disfigured man graveling in self-loathing at the circumstances presented to him wearing bandages covering his face severely burned after a disastrous fire . Mr . Okuyama ( the great Kurosawa regular Tatsuya Nakadai ) is a client of psychiatrist ( Mikijiro Hira ) who offers the troubled man a chance at a new face thanks to an elastic procedure used from the mold of another's facial features . Okuyama is a melancholic pity-party who dwells on his unfortunate condition to the point where he polarizes everyone around him . When he experiences what it's like to have a human face replacing the monster everyone was rejecting ( the film shows the creeped-out expressions of others at the sight of Okuyama in bandages ) , Okuyama " allows the mask to take over " as his doctor begins to worry about how this new found freedom will effect his patient psychologically . Okuyama makes it clear to his doctor that he keeps the mask on as a way of attempting to unmask his wife's betrayal . There's this running commentary that has Okuyama constantly berating his wife feeling she'll leave him for someone who still has their looks . . their face . His scathing views on her every move clearly shows the wear any wife might have trouble enduring . As the new man , Okuyama will set out to seduce his wife seeing if she'll in fact betray him . Meanwhile , a scarred beauty ( Miki Irie ) who hides that bad side with her hair tries desperately to provoke response from her brother who seems uncomfortable with much interaction . A hint of an incestuous relationship between these two is at the forefront of their story as she , much the same way as Okuyama , is quite self-conscious of the scar that labels her a monster . Boy , there are those certain few films that completely overwhelm me . I just can't shake this powerful work of film-making from director Hiroshi Teshigahara regarding the masks we all wear and how , if given a chance , we might react when given an opportunity to experience another life separated from the one we currently live . It takes a deep , penetrating look at identity as well according to how we as a public respond towards others who are burdened with imperfection that shows outwardly . I felt it also looks at the scars inwardly . . no matter how attractive the mask might appear outwardly , if the soul is scarred then the person will still be ugly . So many themes , though , such as trust ( Okuyama's mistrust in his spouse , played by Machiko Kyô , who appeared in such classics as " Rashômon " , " Ugetsu " & " Floating Weeds " ) and dissatisfaction with your existence in this world are touched on . Extremely well acted with thought-provoking , intelligent , rich dialogue that remain with you after the film's haunting ending . The mask make-up work , and how the procedure is played out , is astounding .
Pit and Pendulum	A nobleman from England , Francis ( John Kerr ) comes to an old castle once occupied by a torturer of the Spanish Inquisition , now lived in by his son Nicholas ( Vincent Price ) . Francis is at the castle to find out about how his sister , Elizabeth ( Barbara Steele ) died and to visit her final resting place . It seems that Francis was informed of his sister's death months after the fact . Nicholas is still grieving in his heart over his wife's untimely demise , but seems to be hiding something and Francis is too intuitive a fellow not to notice . Nicholas tells Francis that his sister died of a " blood illness " , but once her attending physician arrives , Doctor Leon ( Antony Carbone ) , he says otherwise . Leon tells Francis that his sister died of shocking fright with her heart stopping . There is a torture chamber in the castle once used readily by Nicholas ' father Sebastian and he believes that the malignant , benevolent atmosphere took hold of Elizabeth eventually killing her . Nicholas is ashamed and burdened by his father's . . and the castle's . . past . Before the moment Elizabeth died , she uttered the name Sebastian for which shook poor Nicholas ' fragile state to the core . Early in Nicholas ' young life ( . . when he was merely 10 years old ) he curiously made his way into father's torture chamber . Hiding in a dark corner when his father enters in with his mother and uncle , young Nicholas witnesses a horrifying sight it has haunted him since . But , to add to Nicholas ' misery is some freaky occurrences which offer the possibility that Elizabeth's ghost has manifested itself within the house . Harpsicord playing ( her specialty ) , her voice heard by the maid who was cleaning , Liz's room ram shackled after much noise , etc . Soon , Nicholas will hear his name being beckoned by the voice he believes to be Elizabeth's . But , what Nicholas doesn't know is that there is more than meets the eye and his mental state , which has been severely torn apart slowly over a tormented time , might not can take it . The pendulum sequence when Nicholas has been lost and another identity / personality takes his place placing poor Francis in certain peril is incredibly tense and accomplished with craftsman skill . Corman's lavish , flavorful sets and unique use of color only add to the overall effect of the film . I love how Corman orchestrates flashback sequences . He closes the camera's eye in on a character retelling a past occurrence . The eye opens on the memory as Corman , acknowledging to us that it is of a different time , tints the screen a unique cloudy blue . The film has atmosphere to spare and Price & company are fun to watch . I love the twist at the end , but the pendulum sequence ( as I already mentioned above ) is the real knock-out of the film . I'd say TPatP has one of the greatest final 20 minutes in horror history . In my opinion , it just doesn't get much better than this .
Lizard in a Woman's Skin	Lucio Fulci's " Schizoid " pulls you in so many directions you know you are watch a filmmaker at his finest point of his career . While I feel other later films were shoddily plotted and illogically unbalanced , this film is right on the mark in every moment . It takes a unique premise using dream logic , the mind's subconscious , blackmail , adultery , lesbianism , and a murder of a hippie socialite and Fulci weaves a web of unpredictability any giallo or horror fan would dream of . The film opens with a dream from Carol Hammond ( Florinda Bolkan ) concerning her delirious trip through an orgy of naked people standing trying to flee but finding herself in the arms of a woman ( the always luscious Anita Strindberg ) . As she tells this to her psychoanalyst , Carol seems to be ridding herself of buried desires in an attempt to " free " herself from the bondage of depravity . But , one such dream shows Carol murdering the woman and it turns out that this occurrence actually happens to the very next door neighbor for whom she speaks of . Soon Carol is the main suspect when the police and detectives find her fingerprints all over the weapon used ( . . not to mention , her fur was by the dead woman's bed ) . Little elements emerge , however , that might save Carol such as these notes she took moments after her awakening from the dreams . Another development shows that her husband Frank ( Jean Sorel ) had access to her notes , understood a point of entrance into the dead woman's pad , could place certain things in the dead woman's room that belong to Carol , and had a motive for seeing his wife put away for murder . . he was having a two year passionate love affair with another woman . Another major development has two possible witnesses at the scene of the crime , one of whom actually chases Carol twice in attempt to kill her with a knife ( in one inspired sequence , Carol raises the ire of a nest of bats in an organ loft as she hid from the one chasing her ) . Is or is not Carol the killer . . that is the main question at the heart of this marvelously deranged , colorful , and thoughtfully designed giallo . I'm a big fan of the use of dream logic and what lies within the human mind as it pertains to a murder mystery . Loving Hitchcock's " Spellbound " about an amnesiac trying to unlock key memories that will answer a puzzling mystery , Fulci uses the same general idea regarding dream logic but moving it in a bizarre , lurid direction . This great movie yields one surprise after another as so many possibilities seem to unfold from what felt like a forgone conclusion . Thanks to Fulci and his collaborators , this film will shock you right up until the end . In my opinion , Fulci's finest film .
