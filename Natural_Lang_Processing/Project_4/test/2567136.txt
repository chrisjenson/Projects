This Is One Secret You Can Keep	Now we know why Godard and Truffaut made such crud movies . They began as critics on Cahiers du Cinema and that magazine rated THIS piece of cheese one of the Best 10 films of 2002 . It is to laugh . Let me pitch a story to you . Two young girls in Paris , passable looking but nothing to write home about . One strips and openly masturbates for customers at a strip club , the other tends bar there . When one refuses to put out after the show the owner fires them both . The bartender moves in with the stripper , who encourages her to shed her inhibitions . Then a light bulb ignites over the stripper's head . ' Why don't we sleep our way to the top ' . This is SO original . I shudder to think how far Nell Gywnne or Lola Montez might have gone if they'd have come up with an idea like this . Thing is , that's IT . End of story . Okay , there are always going to be youngsters who have never seen a naked girl masturbating but in the 21st century they are going to be few and far between . If you like sub-Catherine Breillat then run , don't walk to the box office . Otherwise check out Matrix # 9 .
Booby Prize	This film makes as good a case as I know against dubbing rather than using subtitles ; clearly it would have been dire even with the actor's own voices but equally clearly the dubbing was supervised by someone who instructed the speakers to scrupulously remove all colour and nuance from their voices and maintain an even , monotonous tone throughout . As if that plus a washed-out underlit print weren't enough there is absolutely zero chemistry between every single actor in the cast and every other actor . Alain Delon plays a lawyer - we know that because that's how he is introduced but as he is never shown in a courtroom or even a law office and behaves nothing like a lawyer , we have to take it on trust . Would a lawyer , for example , who has just heard a woman he is representing , invited to the police station to give a statement merely ASK the Inspector if he , the lawyer , could go along or would he as a lawyer , be aware of the law and INSIST on going along . While we're on the subject why do lawyer and inspector - who have been Mr Rilson and Inspector throughout - suddenly and for no apparent reason become Mark and Eric . This is a movie littered with if not indeed punctuated by loose ends and does credit to no one associated with it . One to avoid .
Versailles Cake-walk	Sophia Coppola is clearly a disciple of the Baz Lurhman school of Sloppy Film-making in which the main purpose is to reinvent an actual historical period complete with real characters , some of whom have entered the history / reference books and impose upon it a juvenile ego which is blithely indifferent to facts and marches to the beat of a different drummer , preferably one immersed in Rock . Add a touch of nepotism - male lead Jason Schwartzman is her cousin - and in terms of self-centered insularity Coppola has hit one out of the park . There are some nice visuals but even those have a touch of fakery inasmuch as the existing furniture at Versailles was replaced with Set Designer Blue Plate Special so the best we can say is if you have absolutely no interest in French Culture / History and find nothing wrong with 21st century pop music informing 18th century France then chances are you'll have a ball .
Barnum & Bailey Won't You Please Come Home	It's a truth universally acknowledged that to bring out star quality you need star opposition ; put Roger Federer in with Rafael Nadal and he'll pull out that little something extra , put him in with Tim Henman and he'll phone it in . As it is with athletes so it is with actors , put Joan Crawford up against Bette Davis and she'll raise her game but surround her with the cream of second and third rate British film actors and she can hardly be bothered to offer a Masterclass in how the Big Girls do it . Throw in a plot that would give Morons From Outer Space a run for its money and ain't nobody from this production gonna be looking for the mailman come Oscar nomination time - let's face it , this one is gonna have a tough time getting nominated for the Golden Turkey . This is the kind of film where a guy who travels with a circus wears a suit and tie and given this dress sense it's not so surprising that this guy ( Michael Gough if anyone asks you ) not only wanders into the Big Top in the middle of the night for no apparent reason other than to smoke a cigarette and THEN chooses to lean nonchalantly against the very spot where a VERY NASTY person is waiting to drive a spike right through his head , quite a trick given the strength required and ludicrous when the killer turns out to be someone who weighs about two ounces less than a lemon soufflé ' . Crawford is watchable , just about , but the likes of Diana Dors and Ted - who - told - him - he - could - act - Lune are frankly embarrassing . Definitely one to miss .
Ten New Ways To Grow Old	Like the earlier version of Agatha Christie's novel this remake takes similar liberties with the ' perfect ' crime . Writing , Directing and Acting are all undistinguished and the cast is typical of low-budget product at the time ; a couple of one-time leading men on the way down , a couple of excellent character actors , a couple of recent flavour-of-the-month ephemerals and the obligatory ' pop ' singer . If any of them include this drek on the CVs they are indeed desperate . The story is familiar both to Christie readers and film buffs who saw the first version so basically all that is new is the setting , now a château reachable only by cable car in place of an island off the English coast . Ten wooden indians congregate in reel # 1 , two wooden indians are left at the end . There will be a paint-drying watch at Tuesday's matinée . Be there , it has this beat six ways from the middle .
Nothing Bard	Okay , it's well documented ( a contradiction in terms surely ) that next to nothing is known about Shakespeare the man but to cover his life in EIGHT minutes ! As it turns out the most interesting thing by far about this PR for the soon-to-be-released Romeo and Juliet is the name Jacques Tourneur on the credits and you have to hand it to him for allowing it to remain there . Even in Dickens ' time England / London was down and dirty , sleazy and sinful but THIS England / London . . . remember the way Venice looked in Top Hat , or the ship's engine room in Shall We Dance ? Well that's how MGM saw Stratford and London . Pristine . Legoland . A lovely touch is the name over the arch of a snow-white bridge : Blackfriars . Wanna know about Shakespeare ? Go to the Globe in London and buy a coaster from the souvenir shop . It'll tell you more than this eight-minute movie in two or three sentences .
Fight The Good Fight	One is tempted to give this a high grade just for surfacing in what is apparently a severely abridged print . By some miracle what survives is a story that has a clearly definable beginning , middle and end and the initial conclusion is that anything up to one hour's superfluous ' padding ' has been jettisoned / lost . The main thrust of the plot - the conflict between Catholics and Protestants in a France presided over by Catherine de Medici - is a sort of La Reine Margot-lite without the benefit of a Daniele Thompson screenplay . If it were possible to judge it according to 1928 standards it's not unlikely that it would score a higher rating but other than that the main interest is as an early work of Jean Renoir .
Beautiful Empty Days	I've just been reading several of the comments on this film - as I invariably do before adding my own - and the thing that comes across most strongly is a need for deep analysis that I am unable to share because frankly I don't CARE enough about the characters , plot , etc , to waste good analysis on it . Yes , it was pleasant to watch , some of the set-ups had their moments but all in all it was like the box that the Asian punter had with him . We never find out what was in it and we never will and the chances are it was as empty as this film and the buzzing sound existed only on the sound track just as any ultimate meaning exists only in Bunuel's head . If you've got 100 minutes to spare check it out but if it's a choice between this and Batman go with the guy in the cape .
Role Model	If they were handing out gongs for Best Movie Made For A Stick Of Gum this would at least make the short list ; in other words any criticism needs to take into account the problems encountered by the Writer , Director , and Chief Bottle Washer . We are told that the movie was shot in dribs and drabs over a three year period for a total cost of 3 , 000 euros , that no one wanted the then unknown Kruger who was obliged to more or less steal time in between lucrative modelling engagements to come to the other shoot . This makes it hard to pan but at least we can speculate on what possible target audience it was aimed at . The very people who would perhaps learn a salutory lesson - the pre-teen and teenage girls who choose the Kate Moss's of this world as role models - will be highly unlikely to see it and presumably the rest of us are already aware that modelling isn't a bed of roses . On the plus side Brigitte Cataillon is in it .
Suspense , Drama , Great Acting . . .	. . . are all sadly lacking from what has to be one of the most overrated films that ever came down the pike . Having considered both Hitchcock and Olivier vastly overrated almost all my life I had no problem avoiding this one when it occasionally surfaced on television but recently it was given away with a newspaper and so eventually I stuck it in the DVD and tried to give it a fighting chance to justify the hype surrounding it . I've seen about 90-95 % of Larry Olivier's films and found them mostly ho hum but here he hits a new low worthy of Emil Jannings or Charles Laughton at their worst . Displaying neither charisma nor charm he is nevertheless able to sweep an ultra naive Joan Fontaine off her feet and repair with her to his Gothic manse where the memory of his first wife , Rebecca , is all-pervasive not least with the Gale Sondergaard-lite housekeeper Mrs Danvers ( Judith Anderson ) . About half the ' English Colony ' - UK actors domiciled in Hollywood - pop up in an attempt at ' local color ' so trivia buffs can have a field day looking out for C . Aubrey Smith , Gladys Cooper , Nigel Bruce et al . Keeping up the Hollywood end Florence Bates weighs in with a well-observed harridan in the opening reel and Joan Fontaine walks away with the ' acting ' honors just by being herself . The pseuds love it so who am I to cry ' the king has no clothes on ' .
The Pratfall That Lost The Cream	This played for something like three performances in London a couple of years ago and is now on DVD at ' remainder ' prices both of which suggest white elephant which was the spirit in which I paid the modest freight and viewed it . What it is , in fact , is more of an off-white elephant with period , settings , etc , captured reasonably well and a hybrid of acting styles tending to clash more than they blend , the whole melange in aid of an unsolved crime dating back 80 years in which only any surviving relatives of the principals and the odd film buff and / or scholar could work up much of a sweat about . The facts are that in 1924 William Randolph Hearst hosted a cruise on his yacht on which gathered , in addition to Hearst himself and his mistress Marion Davies , Charles Chaplin , Elinor Glyn and William Ince , a well-known figure in the film circles of the time and who was to prove the victim of a bullet . Hearst had long been suspected of the homicide his motive being his obsessive jealousy in connection with the much younger Davies , fuelled by rumours that she and Chaplin were cuckolding Hearst . At this remove who cares but it does make for an entertaining story and Bogdanovich knows which end of the camera to point at the actors but that's about it . In their own ways most of the principals act well enough but , as noted earlier , they act IN their own individual ways rather than as an ensemble . Worth watching . Once .
Blurb For The ' Burbs	I bought this on DVD knowing next to nothing about it simply on the strength of the leading player , Ginny Ledoyen , about the best young actress of her generation . Having watched it I find I don't have a great deal to say about it . We're in L'Esquive territory here as the film takes place in La Zone , those multi-ethnic high rises surrounding Paris . Apart from the police Maria ( Ledoyen ) is the only white person in the movie and her relationship with her best friend , her boyfriend and his best friend , all Algerian is at the heart of the film so that really it's about four young people in modern France . The four principals do their best but it's downbeat subject matter does it no favours . As a fan of Ledoyen I'm glad I saw it but I'm even happier I only paid 5 euros for it .
Hi Lili Hi LOW	At university I was once obliged to reply in the form of an essay to the question ' Would Moby Dick be a better or worse book if the scientific sections were omitted ' . My reply was along the lines of ' If the scientific parts were omitted Moby Dick would be a shorter bad book ' and that's how I often feel about Rivette who seems incapable of shooting anything less than three hours - nothing wrong with that , witness Gone With The Wind - which is okay EXCEPT his ideas are usually worth no more than forty minutes . He exemplifies most of the things wrong with the New Wave , the abrupt cutting in the middle of a scene , characters appearing on the other side of town moments after walking out of frame , insufficient ' back story ' and / or information . A typical example in this film . Roland confronts Ninon in her apartment and accuses her of stealing a set of documents ( which we have in fact seen her do ) . She tells him to close his eyes , he obliges , she retrieves the documents from where she had hidden them , tells him to remain seated with his eyes closed and - wait for it - LEAVES the apartment , goes across town and gives the papers to Louise after which they go to a night club and dance . In the next shot Ninon enters her apartment Where , incredibly , Roland is STILL sitting with his eyes closed ; in real time this would have to be several hours but Rivette shoots it in such a way as to give the impression of just a few minutes . Okay , call this high Art if you will but Me , I call it SLOPPY film making . The film is full of such sloppiness ; it's billed as a Musical yet the first number occurs more than an hour into the story and such music as there is is banal in the extreme . The plot , or what passes for one , is our old friend the three disparate lives who somehow contrive to interweave ; the three leading actresses are certainly competent or even slightly better than competent as are the males but there are too many dead ends like the faux suicide club which amounts to little more than a twenty minute self-contained set piece inside a three hour movie and serves no discernible purpose . Ironically I thoroughly enjoyed Rivette's Va Savoir and there are certainly echoes of that movie here in the library scenes and the dormer window utilised by Jeanne Balibar in the latter . On balance this is one to be endured rather than enjoyed .
Leak Soup	For a one-idea plot this is reasonably entertaining if you're prepared to overlook the dubious morality of the eponymous character who not only had unprotected sex with three different men in three weeks but cynically accepted monthly checques from each of them for 20 years which by extension depended on convincing and / or allowing each of the three men to think he was the father of her daughter . Having invented , for the benefit of her neighbors to say nothing of her daughter , a dead husband whose name she took from a can of soup the only suspense element is how and when the truth will leak out . With a premise like this the only way to go is to contrive a way for all three men to be in the same place at the same time and once that happens it's just a matter of how long it takes for them to wise up . Given that the three were all with the USAF during World War II the idea of a twentieth reunion sets the ball rolling on what has the makings of a deft farce in the best Feydeau style but turns out to be club-footed . People like Lee Grant and Phil Silvers are basically slumming here whilst Peter Lawford turns in his usual wooden performance and Shelly Winters does her strident bit . Gina Lollobrigida is good to look at but that's about the best you can give it .
This One Won't Go Super Nova	Another freebie , one of six given away last week with The Times . It's marginally less hard to take than some of the others and the story - man accused falsely of murder , goes on the run , meets a nubile girl who , for no reason whatsoever , decides to help him - was creaking even in 1937 yet even Mank would use it in Escape several years later . Like most of the stuff Hitch was churning out at this period it has its share of notable actors , in this case Mary Clare in a quasi sympathetic role , Basil Radford playing himself again and the two leads Derrick de Marney and Nova Pilbeam . As is often the case with Hitch it is shot through with improbabilities - the scene for instance where De Marney nonchalantly flips a wrapper through the window of the mill in which he and Pilbeam are hiding , at the EXACT moment that a local plod happens to glance in that direction , but the best moment of all is when we discover the real murderer ( about which we have been told nothing other than that he killed his wife ) playing drums in an orchestra in which everyone with the exception of the leader is working in ' blackface ' , with the burnt cork reaching only as far as the neck and the hands completely untouched . Okay , Hitch needed a gimmick to make it tough for the only witness to recognise the villain but this was ridiculous .
A Myth Is As Good As A Mille	Other than good , bad or indifferent it's difficult to classify this one . Okay , it's based on a Myth so the director needs to find modern equivalents but this still leaves unanswered questions . Number one must be why Laurent Lucas picked this particular hooker to kidnap . There's no indication that they had met previously and by extension that Laurent would know Tiresia was a pre-op transsexual . Number two , why do none of her hooker colleagues come looking for her and / or report her missing ; given the precarious nature of sex-with-strangers it's reasonable to suppose that hookers write down and / or memorise the numbers of the cars they and their colleagues get into . Number three , where does Lucas get his money ? He appears to have no job yet lives in a large several storey house - albeit dilapidated - and drives a car without a visible source of income . To these can be added others such as what , if any symbolic meaning has the hedgehog in Laurent's garden which he is constantly feeding and why - other than the fact that it fits the original myth - does he opt to blind Tiresia rather than killing her outright or breaking say an arm or a leg . Then we can throw in why does Laurent double the role of a priest in the second half of the film . Though I kept watching til the end these and other questions punctuated the viewing throughout , not the best sign for a filmmaker whose objective surely is to make you forget you're watching a film .
All I Want For Christmas . . .	. . is not to have to watch Gilbert Becaud trying to play ONE role let alone two , and that's before he starts to sing . There were , of course , only two male singers of popular song in twentieth century France ; Yves Montand and all the rest and Montand could have acted Becaud off the screen with one gesture tied behind his back . That leaves Marcel Carne , a giant in French cinema and co-inventor , with seven-time colleague Jacques Prevert , of poetic realism . Alas , here he is a shadow of his former self and one wonders what he saw in this heavily diluted take on A Comedy Of Errors in the first place . On the plus side there are some pleasant visuals but that's about it .
Wagon Wealds	Alas , this is another victim of over hype . It was shown as part of the London Film Festival and the brochure talked a great game . Any film with Richard Widmark is , by definition , never a total loss but even actors of his calibre can't work miracles . Likewise helmer Delmer Daves has some fine credits yet somehow these two A-listers managed to concoct something ho-hum . It was probably daring at the time ( 1956 ) to have Widmark shoot a man in the back in the very first scene - by this time Widmark had graduated from the psychopathic killers ( Kiss Of Death , No Way Out ) that had made his name to four-square heroes so we know there has to be a damn good reason for what he did . There is , but we have to wait til the final reel which sees Comanche Todd ( Widmark ) on trial for murder to discover that three brothers raped his Comanche wife then killed her and his two sons . For his trouble in the opening scene Widmark is ' captured ' by brutal ' sheriff ' Bull Harper ( George Matthews ) and winds up tied to a wagon wheel , part of a wagon train of pioneers heading West , yet is still able to bury an axe in Harper's head . When a group of the younger people sneak off for a midnight swim they return to find that Apaches have killed everyone except Widmark who is halfway down a cliff still tied to the wagon . There's really only one way for the story to go from here ; Widmark must lead the survivors to safety through Apache territory and they are evenly divided between those who like him and those who hate him . Given that it's a ' journey ' movie everyone learns something about themselves . It's watchable because it revolves around Widmark but there isn't half as much chemistry as there should be between him and leading lady Felicia Farr ( on the other hand that was the year she married Jack Lemmon so maybe she had other things on her mind ) and of the three prominent females Susan Kohner walks away with the acting honours .
According To Hoyle	Those who love to detract female directors will probably opine that it is just as well that Nicole Garcia is still acting ( her latest movie is in the Cutting Room even as I write ) and though I confess , as a fan of Garcia the realisateuse , to being a tad disappointed with this entry I can't go along with that lobby who think she should turn in her bullhorn ; she's given us some fine movies in the past and clearly has more fine ones in her . Jean-Pierre Bacri is always going to be an asset to anybody's movie and not just those of his long-time partner Agnes Jaoui , which he also co-writes and here he delivers his best-known persona the miserable grouch which now fits him like a glove . I've never been much of a Benoit Magimal booster in fact the best I can normally give him is that he's the least objectionable of three current French heart throbs the other two being Vincent Cassell and Romain Duris but here he turns in a half decent and sympathetic performance whilst the usually reliable Vincent Lindon seems to be having an off day . Part of the problem is that the film has nothing new to say but insists on saying it anyway ; the plot is our old friend the intersecting lives in a small town where no one is having much fun least of all the audience . On the other hand Garcia really is incapable of making a completely bad film and there are just enough touches to make it tolerable if not memorable .
Mills Bomb	It may well have passed muster at the tail end of the war but seen today the flaws are there for all to see . Stewart Granger's working class accent is a joke and his wooden , over-the-top acting little better . John Mills phones it in as the ' decent ' man who goes AWOL when he hears that wife , Joy Shelton , is stepping out with Granger's spiv whilst he , Mills , is doing his bit . The two best performances by a mile are turned in by Beatrice Varley and Alison Leggatt as Mills ' mother and sister and Jean Kent weighs in with a passable cameo but the climactic fist fight between Purvis ( Granger ) and Colter ( Mills ) is embarrassing . Definitely a Waterloo sunset .
If The Spirit Moves You	The DVD release has an ' extra ' in the shape of Bryan Forbes talking about the film in the course of which he takes full credit for ' inventing ' the child that died at birth - a revelation withheld until the closing stages ; until then Kim Stanley has given the impression that it lived for some years . This raises the interesting speculation that Edward Albee ' stole ' this from Forbes for his own highly successful play ( which has been revived consistently , unlike Seance ) Who's Afraid Of Viginia Woolf , in which , again , a dead male child is referred to throughout the three acts by ' parents ' George and Martha until George ( again it is the husband that forces the wife to accept the truth ) reveals that the child never in fact existed and was a fantasy . Virginia Woolf opened on Broadway in October , 1962 , and played in London at the Piccadilly Theatre the following year whilst Seance was released in 1964 . In a line from the screenplay the leading lady says ' . . . brightness falls from the air . . . ' . In 1941 Nigel Balchin published a very fine novel set during the Blitz and entitled Darkness Falls From The Air . Bryan Forbes owned a bookshop for many years in Virginia Water . As for the film itself , seen in 2008 , it's fairly ho hum though doubtless finding its audience at the time , never one to be afraid of nepotism Forbes again cast his wife , Nanette Newman , and Richard Attenborough's brother-in-law , Gerald Sim , in supporting roles . Kim Stanley has the flashier role and acquits herself well whilst Dickie tends to phone it in . Interesting as a curio .
Russian Lullaby	This is very much the Mixture As Before which wheels out the Usual Suspects , Bannen , Elliott , Calder , etc , and lets them meander through ten reels of Is He , Isn't He , Was He , Wasn't He , Will He , Won't he til it figures the punters have had it up to here at which time it throws in an ambiguous ending . It was a good twenty years since the ' Profumo ' affair so the Producers were fairly safe in recycling the idea of a Government Minister and a KGB Officer sharing the sexual favours of the same hooker as the tip of an increasingly larger iceberg . Gabriel Byrne is the ' investigative ' journo who discovers , surprise , surprise , that there's more to the story than romps in the hay and minor cover-ups and the whole thing is fairly undemanding for Multiplex regulars who can swallow it whole without missing a beat of their popcorn mastication .
Sign Of The Times	Released in 1959 between Godard's Brainless and Truffaut's The Four Hundred Yawns this entry from Rohmer was right there as the first lappings of the New Wavelet dampened the feet of Real French Directors . Within three years the New Wave was washed up ; eventually Truffaut joined the opposition and made Le Dernier Metro completely in a style he had affected to despise and upon which he had poured vitriolic scorn but Godard never did find out how the Big Boys do it . Le Signe du Lion holds up much better than either Brainless or The Four Hundred Yawns and seen today - as it was , literally hours ago - it is valuable as a chronicle of Paris as it was on the edge of the 60s . The location shooting was , of course , dictated by the budget or lack of one but unlike Godard who allowed his camera to follow a Belmondo walking aimlessly and rapidly up and down the same thoroughfare Rohmer opts for a much more leisurely pace as befits his central character , who began by living from hand to mouth and slowly degenerates to fully paid-up bum . American expatriate Jess Hahn is effective as an essentially foolish man who lives for the moment , a grasshopper in a world of ants , happy to splash out all his borrowed money on fair-weather friends on the strength of a misinterpreted telegram and then paying the price as the real friends who may well have come through for him leave Paris on vacation and / or business . People born under Leo do , of course , have a predilection for being the centre of attention which serves as both an explanation and / or justification for Rohmer's camera being fixated on Hahn for something like one and three quarter hours . Along the way the likes of Paul Crauchet and Stephane Audran offer glimpses of the fine actors they would become whilst Godard , significantly , plays an idiot . For a director with a reputation for making ' talky ' movies Rohmer plays down his loquacity this time around and turns in an animated postcard of Paris .
Chess Pie	Asked by his wife , Susan Clark , if he'd like to take in an Eric Rohmer movie ( Ma Nuit chez Maud ) , Harry Moseby , Gene Hackman , replies , ' I saw a Rohmer movie once , it was like watching paint dry ' . This observation by writer Alan Sharp is , of course , right on the money , but Sharp's own movie ( this one ) is like watching an ' action ' painter at work ; first ; place a canvas on the floor , second ; throw a pot of paint at it , letting the paint fall where it will and create whatever random patterns , or none at all , it has a mind to . This is one of those movies that keep academics who ' teach ' film in jobs ; deliberately vague , deliberately open to any and every interpretation you want to impose upon it ; a sterile intellectual mind game masquerading as a private eye movie , or a private eye movie with ideas above its station . You tell me , I wouldn't know a diegetic from a mimetic , if I stump it up at the box office I just want to be entertained and / or diverted for a couple of hours not watch a movie whilst simultaneously taking a Mensa entrance exam . The acting is adequate all round , the plot is as simple as Einstein's Theory of Relativity and about as engrossing . Boy ! am I gonna be popular in Pseud's Corner .
I'm An Indian Too ?	Towards the end of this film much is made of an extended sequence where Henry Fonda sneaks out of a beleaguered fort to get help and in doing so TOTALLY outruns the three indians on his trail . This would have been more believable if we had been provided with any previous proof of or even reference to Fonda's skill in this area . As it is he merely says he can outrun any Indian on earth yet up to now we've seen him driving a team , scything corn and chopping trees . If you don't have a problem with sloppy writing like this - the film opens , for instance , with the wedding of Fonda and Claudette Colbert in an urban setting prior to them settling in the backwoods of upstate New York where Fonda has a cabin . We're never told how a backwoodsman like Fonda came to meet a townie like Colbert in the first place or what they could possibly have in common on which to base a marriage . Colbert herself is something of a fish out of water in a rural setting , her metier was Park Avenue rather than National Park and without a wisecrack on her lips and a martini in her hand she's unfairly handicapped . On the credit side there's some nice photography and Edna May Oliver watchers will welcome another sighting and an Orcar-winning one at that . See it once and move on to later Ford .
And A Little Child Shall Read Them	Although the credits make it clear that this is an adaptation of a novel ( which I've never heard of or read ) it has all fingermarks of something designed by a committee ; flying monkeys as in The Wizard Of Oz ( which is utilised in another context ) , a James Bond-type villain bent on world domination , a device for entering another world like The Lion , The Witch And The Wardrobe and so on . The problem is it's something of a one-trick pony - the trick in this case being books that ' come to life ' under certain readers voices - and ultimately it's not that different and / or better than all the other ' fantasies ' out there , not that it's worse either but it needs more of a voice if it is to be anything more than a diversion on a wet Wednesday .
Diving Bella	This is little more than a programmer designed for the undemanding and very much a product of its time . Take the casting , for example , Fox knew they had a good thing in Widmark and seemed bent on keeping him working - this was his nineteenth movie in eight years - as long as he was solid marquee product . He was a much finer actor than that but this was the tail-end of the Studio System . As for the female lead , Darryl Zanuck was a noted swordsman with a penchant for putting his girlfriends in his productions ( next up would be Juliette Greco ) and who knows , in Polish born Bella Darvi he may have been thinking of a brunette version of Kim Novak though why anyone would want a brunette non-actress as well as a blonde non-actress is one for the Professors . The next factor is the period , this was the era of The Woman On Pier 13 , I Was A Communist For The FBI and so on , the Reds under the bed syndrome . Here we have a gang of Reds bent on dropping an atomic bomb on Korea from a B29 thus leaving America with egg on its face . Not to worry , Widmark and his merry men SHOOT it out of the sky from a sub . Say no more .
Crappy Families	When I saw this in a Multiplex the audience were falling about with laughter so it must be doing something right . Three couples each with kids or , to put it another way , three couples each with the kids from hell . It's a simple premise ; once they get through fantasizing about killing their respective kids the adults decide to play the kids at their own game and show them how it feels : in a typical example a boy who consistently makes farting noises and pretends they emanate from the maid is slipped an ultra strong laxative by his mother and then finds his father has nailed the lid on the toilet seat . Subtle it's not but funny . . . yes , that example is about the most off-color in the whole movie . It's not going to win any prizes except one for passing the time entertainingly and at least it isn't Matrix # 19
Hope Of Haven	John O'Hara ( 1905 - 1970 ) was the finest American Short Story writer of the 20th century and one of the finest novelists . Virtually all of his novels were best-sellers but of the four ( Butterfield 8 , A Rage To Live , From The Terrace , Ten North Frederick ) adapted for the screen only the latter - which won the National Book Award - was anything like satisfactory , whilst Pal Joey - adapted initially by O'Hara himself into the Book of a Broadway Musical with words and music by Rodgers and Hart , from his collection of stories written for The New Yorker - which appeared in an emasculated version of the Broadway musical in 1957 was a major hit mainly due to Frank Sinatra as the eponymous Joey Evans . Like most writers who came to prominence in the thirties O'Hara had several spells in Hollywood and though he only received a sole screenplay credit twice - this film and The Best Things In Life Are Free - he drew on his time there for some of his finest short stories , one Novella , Hope Of Heaven , and one novel , The Big Laugh . Fox paid him $1 , 250 a week to adapt Willard Robertson's novel for the screen and he worked on it from May through July of 1941 . What emerged was a mixture of several elements ; San Pablo an inlet in Southern California is Steinbeck country and its denizens are akin to those inhabiting Cannery Row but without the humour ; top-billed French star Jean Gabin enjoyed one of his biggest successes in the Carne-Prevert Quai des Brumes , also set in a foggy port and involving violent death , and there's also something of Irwin Shaw's The Gentle People about it ( After O'Hara Shaw was the second finest American short story writer of the 20th century but he wrote The Gentle People as a stage play ) . Lawyer-turned-actor Robertson appeared in more than 100 movies but put pen to paper only three times and Moontide was his only novel . It's a simple premise ; gentle giant Bobo ( Gabin ) , a drifter , is prone to getting drunk and blacking out and relies on ' minder ' Thomas Mitchell , to keep him out of trouble and find him work ( shades of Lennie and George in Steinbeck's Of Mice And Men ) . In the past he had strangled a man ( a nod to La Bete Humaine , another Gabin movie ) and Mitchell was privy to this and uses it as a lever to live off Gabin's labour . In the first reel a minor character , Pop Kelly , is strangled whilst Bobo is drunk and Mitchell allows him to fear the worst . The fly in the ointment is Anna ( Ida Lupino ) who Bobo rescues when she tries to drown herself . They fall in love , marry , and Mitchell attempts to destroy them . Robertson wrote a realistically tragic ending but Fox weren't buying that for birdseed in 1941 so it's a case of all's well that ends well as two dysfunctional people find hope in the haven of a bait-shack on the California coast . All O'Hara fans will want to see it but probably not all of them will enjoy it .
Plane And Fancy	I've been gradually working my way through a Boxed Set of eight of the nine movies that Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers made at RKO between 1933 and 1939 - saving the studio from bankruptcy in the process - and I saved the first til last ( Roberta is the missing title ) on the grounds that it wasn't technically a Rogers / Astaire movie at all - top billing went to Gene Raymond ( who he ? ) and Dolores Del Rio with Fred and Ginger billed below them . Seeing it today it's crystal clear why the powers that be at RKO ( still known as Radio Pictures at the time of this release ) took one look and immediately lined up a vehicle to showcase the team . The dance they do to The Carioca is literally light years ahead of any terpsichore to be seen on Stage or Screen and in addition they were both experienced troupers , Fred had been in vaudeville and then Musical theatre from childhood and Ginger had already made a modest mark in a handful of movies and handled the occasional wisecracks allotted to her character with aplomb . The plot is neither here nor there and typical Depression escapist fare but Vincent Youmans turned in a fine score including the badly neglected ballad Orchids In The Moonlight , the title song and , of course , The Carioca . I'm guessing that at the time the film was built around the title number which may well have been subtitled Eat Your Heart Out , Busby Berkley , which featured a bra-less chorus line strapped on to the wings of a half dozen planes as they fly over Rio de Janeiro but probably even then this spectacle was forced to share top honors with the sensational dancing of Fred and Ginger . It's badly dated , of course , but even after 70 odd years it entertains .
An Affair To Forget	As an admirer of Tonie Marshall I was disappointed with this effort and of the four Marshall films I've seen ( and own ) , Venus Beaute , France Boutique , Les enfants du salauds I have to relegate this to fourth place . Yet again Leo McCary's ' An Affair To Remember ' crops up in someone else's movie . Maybe Noel Coward should have said in Private Lives ' strange how potent cheap MOVIES can be ' and not ' cheap music ' . Catherine Deneuve adores An Affair To Remember and sits through it time after time even going so far as to arrange a rendezvous of her own atop the Empire State Building . This doesn't gibe with her overall coldness not least to her own daughter but go to New York she does and there she meets William Hurt with not a shred of chemistry between them . It ends ambiguously but it's difficult to respond to on any level .
Paris When It Sizzles	Mank didn't write the screenplay for this , his penultimate movie but elected instead for a script from the team responsible for Bonnie and Clyde . The plot itself , a melange of Western meets Big House was also something of a departure though given his proved eclecticism no one was really surprised . Curate's Egg is as good a description as any for while it is definitely good in parts ultimately it fails to satisfy . Hume Cronyn , working for a third and final time with Mank may well have relished the return to at least half the genre where he made his name - at least as a film actor - as the brutal warder in Brute Force playing someone diametrically opposite in the form of a gay con . I didn't note that much chemistry between the two leads , Douglas and Fonda , unlike say , Douglas and Lancaster but the film does benefit from a rich assortment of support in the shape of John Randolph , Warren Oates , Arthur O'Connell , Burgess Meredith and Lee Grant . Douglas ' exotically named Paris Pitman seems out of place in the Arizona desert but charms his way through . Interesting rather than memorable .
Actor Proof	It was , perhaps , inevitable that Sacha Guitry would eventually get round to writing about his father , Lucien , a star of Le Comedy Francaise and a couple of Silent films ( he died in 1925 ) and an actor of the school that included Jack Barrymore , Bransby Williams and others of that ilk . Never one to hide his light under a bushel Sacha plays a dual role of father and son and clearly has a lot of fun panning from himself to himself as if to challenge the audience to hold its collective breath . He limns his father economically as in the scene where Lucien is in his study declaiming aloud from a favorite text only to be interrupted by the telephone : ' Pardon , Moliere ' cries the thespian to the playwright as he answers it . Elsewhere Guitry shoots a scene almost entirely in a mirror , a schtick he had used in other films . A fine addition to the Guitry canon .
Cometh the hour . . .	In 2005 Pascal Thomas adapted an Agatha Christie story for the screen , signed up Catherine Frot and Andre Dussollier for the leads and enjoyed the minor success which prompted him to do it again ergo Zero Hour . In my case top-billed Danielle Darrieux - still acting in her ninety first year - was all the inducement I needed to get it up at the box office and the fact that Thomas has made another competent film is a bonus . If you like movies in which the actors wear timeless , well-cut clothes , move in a well-appointed château with a seascape thrown in for good measure and behave in obligatory mysterious ways so that an eventual murder has been long anticipated then you won't be disappointed . Chiara Mastroianni , looking more like her father every day is also on hand to remind us what we lost when her father died and if she bears only a passing resemblance to her mother that's not so important because mum Catherine Deneuve is still very much with us . It's doubtful if Chiara will ever achieve the iconic status of her parents but she gets acting jobs because casting directors and producers know she can deliver rather than because of her genes . An enjoyable romp .
What's Up , Doc ?	It's difficult to know what Benoit Cohen had in mind here . Mid-life crises are not exactly new but they usually involve dressing younger , buying a sports car and generally making a fool of oneself ; seldom does someone in the grip of MLC abandon a highly successful career to become a full-time rock musician as in this case . Theoretically if one DID abandon a job as a Senior Consultant in a large hospital to pursue a career in rock one would , by definition , need to find enough people undergoing crises of their own and have them be 1 ) sufficiently talented and 2 ) equally prepared to abandon careers in which they have established themselves ; in short , unrealistic . Nevertheless that's what our intrepid hero does , to the chagrin of both his father , who suffers a heart attack on hearing the news , and his Avocat wife . Cohen seems to want it both ways ; on one hand the Doctor succeeds in living his dream , on the other it all ends in tears . It's certainly interesting and pleasant to watch but little more .
Heathcliffhangers	Q . How do you confuse a Multiplex Moppet . A . Put Ewan McGregor on the marquee and then have him kiss Douglas Hodge . They're gonna love this in the UGCs but the rest of us can bask in a strangely old-fashioned portmanteau entry with no fancy angles - in fact hardly Any Angles at all to speak of ; Long Shot , Medium Shot , Close Shot and . . . er . . that's about it . Made for a stick of gum and looking like it was made for at least a pack it offers a sort of clear CCTV footage of an afternoon on Hampstead Heath in which seven couples muse on the nature of love and / or perhaps more accurately , relationships . Whilst it's unlikely that you'd encounter quite so many variants in a single afternoon you would almost certainly come across three or four including the obligatory gay duo , McGregor and Hodge , not so long after they co-starred on stage in Guys and Dolls and now , after a fifteen year relationship addressing the question of adopting a child . Elsewhere Eileen Atkins and Benjamin Whitrow stretch credulity by meeting again after half a century and marriage to other people , Sophie Okenado is dumped , Hugh Bonneville undergoes an uneasy blind date , Catherine Tate and Adrien Lester meet up in the wake of their divorce and so on . It's a gentle , nonthreatening afternoon , well acted , competently written and shot but it may not be enough though I hope it is .
Put Your Dreams Away	This is one of several British films dating back to the 1950s / 60s that were recently given away by a National newspaper and for me at least it's the one that seems to hold up the best , not least due to the fine performance by Tom Courteney . The dreamer has , of course been with us since James Thurber's Walter Mitty if not earlier so we don't go in expecting originality which is just as well . In retrospect the supporting cast come across a a matched set of clichéd cardboard characters and it's a little disconcerting that Billy Fisher had somehow contrived to get himself engaged to such a pair of diametrically opposed girls ; one almost a Sunday-School teacher in the making the other virtually a tart , I've heard of the Madonna / Whore philosophy but this is ridiculous . Essentially if you take Tom Courteney out of the mix you've got no film but with him in situ it's certainly worth watching .
Spectre At The Feast	I don't as a rule ' do ' James Bond though I did see most of the Sean Connery titles on television where this one , the second in the franchise , surfaced again last night on the BBC . What it has going for it is a lack of OTT special effects and a reasonably credible plot . There's also a nice touch in the opening pre-credit sequence in which Bond is stalked and successfully garotted by Robert Shaw . This has to be a gag , of course , because otherwise you have a Bond film without a Bond and it turns out that Bond was in fact , a stooge wearing a Bond mask and S . P . E . C . T . R . E . were merely ' training ' Shaw to kill the real thing . Shaw was , of course , a fine actor - as well as a novelist - and the film also offers ' classy ' support in the shape of Lotte Lenya as Rosa Kleb sporting a nice line in orthopedic footwear . Daniela Bianchi is the girl this time around and is no better or worse than any of the others . All in all a pleasant diversion .
Class of 1975	Some 27 years after its Broadway opening the movie adaptation of Chicago finally made it to the screen albeit with a couple of ' alterations ' - at least one number , ' Class ' was jettisoned after shooting and this time around Mary Sunshine is actually played by a female rather than a guy in drag , which scored heavily as a shock ' revelation ' in the stage version . In either format Chicago is a collection of great showtunes in search of a Book . Sure , the satire and social comment is biting and a deadly accurate portrayal of life that is as relevant today as it was in the twenties where celebrity is everything and real talent counts for naught . The cast are competent but about the best you can say for them is that they don't embarrass themselves with ideas above their station . The easily pleased will revel whilst the truly discerning will sigh for what might have been .
The Small Dipper	There's a lot of irony here whether intentional or not . For instance the protagonist , Michel , makes a living as a dip yet he NEVER seems to lock the door of his apartment which is in what is more or less a tenement . Not only does he not lock the door but times he leaves it ajar to boot . By now I've seen enough Bresson to recognize the trademarks ; the ' players ' , invariably amateurs who act as if on valium seldom straying from the middle of the spectrum , no hysterics whether comedy or tragedy is the springboard ; the camera dwelling on a scene long after the actors have left it , the gaps in chronology , etc . If you like and / or admire Bresson then this won't matter , in fact it may even enhance the proceedings , but if you're indifferent and / or actively dislike him then these schticks will only add fuel to your critical fire . I saw this within 24 hours of watching The Umbrellas Of Cherbourg which made it easier to notice that in both films the guardian figure - respectively aunt and mother - of the protagonist has a companion in the shape of a young girl who is , it seems , there only to supply an eventual love-interest for the protagonist , in this case she is played by Marika Green whose own niece , Eva , is now acting in French films herself . This is certainly worth seeing and there's an outside chance it could grow on you .
That Towering Feeling	One Hundred Ways To Lose Your Lover ? Forget the Black Widow and the Praying Mantis they're SO Paleolithic , take a leaf out of Marguerite's book , boff them , have them thrown from the eponymous tower into the Seine with an archer standing by to place an arrow where it will do the most good when they surface . Alexander Dumas was something of a Graham Greene in the number of times his work has been adapted for the screen and / or theatre and television - the figure is now approaching 200 with no end in sight - and Gance himself had a crack at La Reine Margot but alas , Daniele Thompson wasn't around to whip up a screenplay . As someone familiar with the Rue de Nesle , where it's small theatre often stages the works of Agnes Jaoui and Jean-Pierre Bacri , I had an extra interest in this late work from Gance and I have to say that it fascinates on several levels notably the use of colour which the French cinema had not explored in great detail at the time ; if it isn't just a faded print I saw then Gance's use of muted pastels where others would have used bold oils is to be applauded as his eye for filling the frame with detail and achieving a fine blend of gentry and peasant . The principal setting would not be out of place in a Robin Hood movie and indeed with all the lingering shots of stone staircases punctuated by burning torches mounted on wall brackets one half expects to come upon Errol Flynn striking sparks of Basil Rathbone . The plot itself is a heady brew of over-heated intrigue , passion , lust , betrayal which is so much poppycock but Michel Bouquet throws in a nice cameo as a slightly ditsy Louis X and it's interesting to know that not only did the French invent tennis but squash as well . One for connoisseurs .
Legionnaire's Disease	Duvivier , Gabin , what's to be bad , right . W - e - e - ll , I have to say right off that this could have been better ; Gabin had already appeared in an earlier Duvivier entry , Maria Chapledaine and within a couple of years he would score really heavily in Duvivier's Le Belle equipe and Pepe Le Moko - in fact you could argue that this is something of a dress rehearsal for Pepe given that in both films Gabin winds up in North Africa escaping a criminal past in France . Most of the faults are in the script . After a brief opening sequence in Paris - which anticipates Le Jour se leve with Gabin starting the film by ending a life - we switch abruptly - and for no satisfactory reason - to Barcelona where Gabin has his pocket picked with nothing more made of it . Then he enlists in the Spanish Foreign Legion and this is where the story really starts - again there is a foretaste of Pepe Le Moko in that a relentless cop , Robert Le Vigan , clearly mistaking Gabin for Jean Valjean , hounds him as he would be hounded in the Casbah . Top-billed Annabella doesn't really convince as an Arab dancing girl anymore than the instant attraction and marriage between her and Gabin . Another poster has pointed out the ludicrousness of having a well OUTSIDE the fort which makes it that much easier for the enemy to pick off the Legionnaires as they venture outside lest they dehydrate . On the other hand this IS a Duvivier film and Duvivier WAS a genius so there are moments to savour and as I've said before even an off-form Duvivier is light years better than Godard on the best day he ever had .
A Walk On The Tame Side	I was invited to view and comment on this movie by the makers and I'm happy to oblige . The idea of showing a situation from two points of view is not , of course , new , but then what is . The most recent example that springs to mind is A la folie . . . pas du tout , Audrey Tatou's follow-up to Amelie but that of course was a full-length drama which changed perspective half way through . In Nightwalking the premise couldn't be simpler ; a woman walking alone late ( presumably ) at night finds a man walking behind her . Both fear the worst ; she that he is a violent criminal and / or rapist , he , that she will THINK he is one or both of these things when he knows he is a pussycat . So far so good but the question that arises of course is WHAT , in this day and age , would persuade a lone female - who is not a hooker - to walk alone down an extremely quiet / lonely thoroughfare - for that matter what would induce a harmless lone male to do the same thing . At under three minutes there is little climax possible so perhaps the cop-out ending was the only game in town . This is extremely well made , shot and acted .
With Friends Like These . . .	At a superficial level this is Beauty And The Beast with spin . The Beast isn't really handsome and Beauty doesn't really fall in love with him but he is unprepossessing to say the least and she is attractive and maybe even beautiful in the right light . The Beast , Geremia is a tailor by profession who does a little loan sharking on the side and loses no opportunity to waive repayments in return for sexual favours reaching a new low on the day he sleeps with a young bride minutes before her wedding . As if to emphasize the fairytale source the director allows no chance to point up the squalor in which Geremia lives with his bedridden mother to go unexploited whilst contrasting this with a succession of comely young girls . Woven inextricably into all this is a Sting perpetrated by Geremia's best friend , Gino . It's an interesting movie to say the least and a notable follow-up to the same directors The Consequences Of Love but I'm not sure if it will stand subsequent viewings .
Top Banana	As a student of irony it pleases me immensely to know that even as Jacques Prevert was inventing the concept of poetic realism with director Marcel Carne - Quai des Brumes was written back to back with Ernest le Rebelle - he was also writing Ernest le Rebelle which is about as far from realism , poetic or otherwise , as you can get . Fernandel was a great comic actor who made 150 films all told none of which had more than a nodding acquaintance with reality ; this time around he is an accordionist ( note : in England we distinguish between a concertina which does not have keys and an accordion which does , ergo in Englnd he would be playing a concertina ) on a cruise ship and already in Dutch with at least one irate husband . In port he spends the night in a hotel and is ' rolled ' for his trouble , waking to find both his passport and the liner long gone . You don't really need to know how he winds up in a banana republic with a group of what today we would call ' freedom fighters ' , all you do need to know is the formula : Jacques Prevert + Christian Jacques + Fernandel = Escapism .
Lives Of A Senegal Lancer	It's difficult to guess the target audience the producers were aiming for here . The only ' marquee ' name is Michel Serrault and though his CV is as impressive as any he is way up in the paint cards and it's asking a lot to expect him to carry a film as offbeat as this . It's May , 1940 and the Germans are coming . In Etienne's ( Serrault ) small village in rural France everyone has left leaving just him and a granddaughter Camille and grandson . Then a small - some six or seven - troop of Senagalese soldiers turn up more or less just in time to prevent Camille getting a bad dose of cabin fever . Not a lot happens ; she plays the victrola , dances with one of the soldiers and that's about it . Then the Germans finally ARRIVE and blow the village off the map with their panzers . Camille and her brother take to the river leaving the others to do the best they can . There's a certain amount of charm / nostalgia on display here but it's going to have to work hard to find its audience .
Term Of Trial	I finally got around to seeing this in a London with unseen good films thin on the ground . Whilst I found it less than riveting it did keep me watching and I was able to wallow in Caroline Keener's fantastic support as Harper Lee . Hoffman is just as brilliant in the eponymous role as everyone said he was yet nevertheless it was difficult to become engrossed in the story and I found myself wondering why - when a caption announces the time as November , 1956 , the leaves on the trees are not being stirred by a wind whilst Capote and Lee are definitely dressed for winter , which is hardly the sign of a gripping movie . In my case I was equally , if not more so , interested in William Shawn and Harper Lee as they figured in Capote's life as the two killers . Like I said interesting but not memorable .
Allan Key	This is all mood and none the worse for it . Trivia buffs will seek it out because Abel Gance had a supporting role ( to say nothing of Marguerite Gance as Madeleine Usher ) , Luis Bunuel adapted Poe and quit as co-director when he failed to see eye to eye with Epstein . Several posters have praised the music which I found totally inapposite but then what do I know . Jean Debucourt ( Roderick ) has a long and distinguished career and appeared in some of my favorite French movies - Douce , La Ciel est a vous , Marguerite de la nuite , Madame de , etc - and is suitable restrained for a silent film when ' emoting ' was de riguer . Anyone who has read anything of Poe let alone the original story will feel at home with this adaptation despite Epstein's cavalier treatment of the story . Photography , atmos , etc , are right on the money and it's well worth seeking out .
Old Hat	For some reason I've never seen this movie on television though it's reasonable to assume it's been shown over the years so when it surfaced as part of an 8 Fox Musicals boxed set at a silly price ( £30 , which works out at £3 . 75 a throw ) I snapped it up , especially since 1 ) it was selling elsewhere at £50 and 2 ) out of 8 titles I only owned one ( Daddy Longlegs ) . You can't copyright a title , of course , and this was the third movie since 1939 ( the second appeared in 1941 ) called The Gang's All Here and since the other two seem to have sunk without trace this is probably the most substantial . I doubt if anyone went to see this , either at the time or subsequently , looking for a solid plot ; chances are they went to see Alice Faye who was just about to abdicate as ' Queen ' of the Fox lot , and hear the score though in 1943 they wouldn't necessarily have been aware of Harry Warren and Leo Robin . What Faye did was warmth - as opposed to glamor laced with cynicism ( Betty Grable , her immediate successor as ' Queen ' ) or dumb ( Marilyn Monroe , who succeeded Grable ) - which is not to say she was chopped liver , in fact she was lovely rather than beautiful and the warmth embraced not only her personality but also her voice which she put to good use in her nine-year musical career at Fox during which time she introduced 23 ' hits ' , in fact in the same year ( 1943 ) as The Gang's All Here she had already introduced another Harry Warren hit song , You'll Never Know in Hello , Frisco , Hello , a song which , of course , went on to win the Best Song Oscar . She supplemented ' Know ' with two more fine ballads in this movie , A Journey To A Star and No Love , No Nothing and the score also included Paducah , Minnie's In The Money - a solo vocal for Benny Goodman ? and two typical Busby Berkeley Production Numbers , Carmen Miranda's The Lady In The Tutti-Frutti Hat and Faye's Polka-Dot Polka in which everyone joined in as a grand finale . June Haver popped up as a hat-check girl and Jeanne Crain had one line but the support included - apart from Benny Goodman and his band - Charlotte Greenwood , Eugene Palette and Edward Everett Horton all of whom contributed to a pleasant diversion . Faye , who was pregnant at the time , made one more film two years later , it was a ' straight ' role in Otto Preminger's Fallen Angel and in the wake of what she considered Darrell Zanuck's inept editing of what Faye herself considered a fine acting performance she retired from the screen resurfacing some twenty years later in the remake of State Fair . As swan songs go The Gang's All Here isn't bad at all .
The Art Of Falling Down In Darkness	Here we have on one level a Burke hareing about , ironically someone has snatched his body and attached it to a mind that is spinning out of control . For the referential it's possible to read it as Mamet's take on Heart of Darkness and / or Falling Down ; for those who wouldn't know Joseph Conrad from Lefty Grove it's William H . Macey giving yet another outstanding performance in something that is probably not worth his time and talent . Make no mistake , if we don't buy Macey retrogressing from an ' average ' businessman , in a long-standing marriage to brutal killer in a matter of hours then the whole thing becomes risible . Perhaps a central flaw is just this time element ; lots of people suffer breakdowns in middle years but not overnight ; it creeps up on them imperceptibly til one day they run into that final straw and snap . In this case we can only suppose that Macey had been slipping away for years and we caught up with him just as his malaise peaked , but that's a lot to ask of an audience and lots of people won't be bothered to work at it . The acting is uniformly good but Macey is , as stated , outstanding but this will definitely divide opinion .
Cruel Yule	Clearly in one respect at least a disciple of Jacques Rivette , Arnaud Desplechin doesn't do brief . Presumably he sees anything under two hours as a one-reeler and tends to deliver around two and a half hours as a mean average . He also has a tendency to use actors over and over - for example Manu Devos , Mathieu Amlaric and Catherine Deneuve all appeared in Kings and Queen , albeit Deneuve was little more than a cameo there whilst she here she gets centre stage as the matriarch of a dysfunctional family that makes Gene O'Neill's haunted Tyrones look like the Waltons . Whatever you may think of the plot and length you can't fault the acting and Anne Consigny is especially effective as the elder sister metaphorically wearing Masha Black in mourning for her life . It's a great big roller-coaster ride of a movie and ultimately rewarding .
The Final Tattoo ?	In retrospect this was ideal fodder for the masses on the brink of war ; sight gags , songs , comedy AND Fernandel , one of THE comic icons of French Cinema . The plot is just something that permits Fernandel to strut his stuff - his boss catches him at a funfair when he should be working in his capacity as night watchman , but that wasn't HIM , no , of course not , it was his brother . From there you can write it yourself , but why bother , instead enjoy the one that's already been written and directed with just the right touch by Christian Jacque . If you already know Fernandel from other movies - or Christian Jacque for that matter - then you won't need any urging from me to check this one out , if you don't know Fernandel or Jacque it's time that you did . Another winner from France via Norway .
Yentl Come Home	Don't see this if there are no subtitles and your French is sketchy at best to non-existent otherwise you'll drive yourself crazy trying to figure out if it's a fantasy or what . It's 1917 and the war is in full spate . In the North East of the country Sylvie Testud gets a Dear Jean letter and instead of murmuring philosophically , c'est la vie , c'est l'amour she chops off her hair , finds a pair of pants and lights out for the front to ask the guy who done her wrong just what he thinks he's doing . Before long she runs across a raggle-taggle unit led by Pascal Greggory , tags along and winds up with a uniform - they just happened to have a spare in her size as you do - but no gun and becomes part of the group . They march , and march and march some more but strangely enough in the middle of a major war they never run into any actual fighting though they do hear gunfire on one occasion . Even more bizarrely they keep breaking into song , complete with an quintet / sextet of soldier / musicians at a time when one would have thought discretion would dictate silence . Eventually Testud's errant mate shows up , they put in some sack time - in pajamas yet , presumably from the same quartermaster's stores that laid the uniform on Testud - and the group moves on leaving them to it . It's actually a beautifully shot and engrossing film a sort of hybrid of Yentl , Victor Victoria and A Very Long Engagement . Sylvie Testud is clearly brave enough to play a role in which she is seen as androgynous whereas she is actually a very lovely and very feminine actress and she works well with Greggory although virtually all the actors turn in fine performances . Not really multiplex fodder but no worse for that so if there's an Art House near you lobby them to book this .
All In The Mind	Over and above everything else this is a superb chamber piece , a string quartet in which each voice complements the others and the whole is equal to its parts . Clearly written originally for the stage the opening out though skilfully done is academic as is any moral , ethical stance given that writer director Shanley ( who also wrote the original play ) deliberately offers no solution other than that in the mind of the viewer . Perhaps because her role is so small compared to the other three Viola Davis tends to make the most impact so that it is her performance as the mother of a son who may or may not have been abused by a priest , that tends to stay with you . This isn't the same as saying that those of Meryl Streep as the principal of the Catholic school who confronts Philip Seymour Hoffman's Father Flynn or Amy Adams as the go-between Sister Jane are chopped liver . All four performances should be celebrated with gongs and should be seen by aspiring actors and connoisseurs of fine screen acting .
Major League	Let's hear it for the NFT . At LAST they're mounting a season of well-made , sophisticated , accessible films that appeal to a WIDE audience and not the usual half dozen academics augmented by the best of Rent-A-Pseud . During November and December it will be possible to view every film that Billy Wilder directed but not , bizarrely , those he only wrote - like Ninotchka , Midnight , Bluebeard's Eighth Wife , Arise , My Love , Ball Of Fire , Hold Back The Dawn for openers . Lest I seem a tad critical of the NFT I must hasten to add that they HAVE screened a Wilder retrospectively previously , something like THIRTY years ago , in the interim members have been able to slake their unquenchable thirst for Inuit Subculture , New Voices from New Guinea , The Best Lottery Money Disasters and / or anything else the selection committee feel will alienate the most fans of REAL cinema . Be that as it may we do have a chance to wallow , albeit briefly , in some of the Best cinema extant beginning with this , the first movie that Wilder directed at what had become his home studio , Paramount . Even today it holds up remarkably well and the screening I attended was punctuated with appreciative laughter throughout so in 1942 it's reasonable to assume that it was spellbinding . Ray Milland had starred in Arise , My Love , written by Wilder and would appear to great advantage in The Lost Weekend in which he had considerably more to do than display a respectable profile and a modicum of charm . In retrospect it's easy to credit Wilder with making Lolita while Nabakov was little more than a child himself but such is the skill and professionalism involved that paedophilic subtexts would barely have risen their uncomfortable heads in 1942 . All hands acquit themselves superbly not least Diana Lynn as a real precocious teenager who sees through Rogers in nothing flat . Roll on the DVD .
Nice Little Film , Shame About The Title	This is the kind of title that in most cases I wouldn't even bother reading reviews for but in this case several people actually told me it was worth seeing so I checked the reviews and figured there may be something in it . All I can say is I'm glad I did . I notice that the bulk of the reviews on the first page of this site concentrate on the leading character and his three male buddies and whilst they were all more than competent / amusing for me the best thing about it was the warmth , not to say gorgeousness , of Catherine Keener who I've seen only in The Interpreter . If you ARE a virgin at 40 - or 14 for that matter - then I can think of no one better than Keener to initiate you into the the pleasures of sexual love . Having said that I have a feeling that this is one of those films that exert a peculiar charm as you watch them - once . I may be wrong but I have the feeling that a second visit may prove disappointing .
Danish Blue	It seems that France isn't the only country in Europe where female directors turn out classy movies . Susanne Bier , a new name to me , hits one out of the park with this Art House entry . It takes its time in getting where it's going and there are those who may find the top-and-tail Indian sequences superfluous and leading man Mads Mikkelsen - the heavy in Casino Royale - doesn't do expression , which means that if you don't dig The Great Stone Face you'll be disappointed but against this is some top-drawer thesping from the likes of Rolf Lassgard as a millionaire businessman , Sidste Babett Knudsen as his wife and Stine Fisher Christensen as their daughter . Mikkelsen is a transplanted Dane now living in India , running an orphanage and possibly atoning for a mis-spent youth on the side . A Danish philanthropist shows interest in making a bequest but for reasons best known as Plot # 4a ; Subsection 5 , he has to go to Copenhagen and cosy up to the fairy godfather . Reluctantly he agrees and when he gets there it coincides with the wedding of the businessman's daughter , to which he is invited . You could have knocked me down with a fender ( thanks to Dorothy Parker , from whom I stole that ) when it turns out that the businessman's wife is Mikkelsen's ex-girl friend which makes her daughter . . . well , I won't spoil it for you ( and if you haven't guessed WHAT it makes her then I COULDN'T spoil it for you . From then on it's angst , tears , sturm , drang , the whole nine yards but it's also Class and Style . It's not everybody's cup of schnapps by a long way but if you enjoy Quality you'll enjoy this one .
Chance Is A Fine Thing	This movie is a loving valentine to the wonderful Danielle Darrieux who will turn 90 on May 1st of this year and already has two further films in the can . Those who have seen Darrieux - who has been in show business for 75 years - in her youth ( she appeared in Billy Wilder's first directorial effort , Mauvaise Graine , in 1934 ) and prime ( the films she made with her husband Henri Decoin ; Mank's Five Fingers with James Mason , Marie Octobre etc , will perhaps feel a faint sadness at the tricks Time plays or else , like me , they will rejoice to see a consummate artiste still able to carry a film and even end it with a song . Ostensibly this is a third ' Augustin ' movie in which Fontaine has chronicled the ups and downs of a slightly eccentric character played by her own brother , Jean-Chretien Sibertin Blanc , but Darrieux steals it effortlessly from under his nose and that of Arielle Dombasle . No one will accuse this of being a great movie but it is definitely a WARM movie and Fontaine is to be applauded for celebrating a great actress . Roll on the DVD .
Here's Looking At You , Kids	On paper this shouldn't have survived the Pitch but on celluloid it metamorphoses into a fine almost folksy film which , like the central cattle drive , succeeds against all the odds . The central premise is simplicity personified ; ageing rancher Duke Wayne needs to get his cattle to market , normally this is no problem but he needs to do it NOW and it's only days since gold fever struck with a vengeance leaving no one available for the drive . Necessity being the mother of invention Duke is more or less forced to recruit some genuine cowBOYS inasmuch as he turns literally to a group of schoolboys who know absolutely nothing about driving cattle long distances and have even less experience . Throw in a Black cook cum philosopher cum fount-of-all-wisdom , a peripatetic troupe of hookers and a Very , Very BAD man in the shape of Bruce Dern , leading a gang of rustlers and we're talking one of the most entertaining Westerns that ever came down the pike .
Anti Everything	Looking rather similar to Ruth Gordon Tsilla Chelton who takes the eponymous role here gives us a Master Class in Mischief if stopping short of downright evil . She is an amalgam of every irascible curmudgeon you've ever met and wished you hadn't and although it's difficult to discern a secondary meaning other than a Case History of the worst aspects of old age this is a film to be enjoyed as one enjoys a pile-up in a motor race safe in the knowledge that we don't indulge in Formula 1 so will never experience those thrills other than vicariously but most of us , on the other hand , will grow old and God forbid we run across a Tatie Danielle of our own . It's also good to see Karin Viard and Isabelle Nanty in early appearances displaying the promise we have now seen fulfilled . One to see again .
First Tango In Paris	This tale of a crook who is rumbled and then blackmailed to off a third party also served Patrice Leconte years later when he fashioned Tango out of it . This time around it's the great Carette - established brilliantly as an inept robber in the first sequence where his intended victim easily disarms him and then , adding insult to injury , returns his wallet which she has lifted skillfully without his knowledge . His next job is opening a safe in the home of Pierre Brasseur and to which , a la Runyon's Butch Minds The Baby , he takes along a brace of juves . Naturally he is caught in flagrante by Brasseur who then puts it to him that if he were to consider topping his ( Brasseur's ) wealthy cousin they'll say no more about the bungled robbery . Inevitably the cousin , Ludovic , ostensibly the village idiot , turns out to be a nice guy who Leonard can't help liking . Written by Jacques this was directed by his kid brother Pierre Prevert who wasn't best pleased at having Charles Trenet more or less thrust upon him in the key role of Ludovic . Better known at the time as a singer songwriter Trenet was woefully inferior to Yves Montand as both a singer and an actor though he was a superior songwriter but all he has to do here is look cute and fill his house with gypsies and livestock which he manages to pull off without tripping over the kleigs and in the event turned in what would turn out to be his best screen performance by far . With Prevert on quill the puns come thick and fast and the writing is as polished as we have come to expect from him . One to savour .
Let's Party	Tavernier hit one out of the park with this , his second At-Bat . With the not inconsiderable help of Jean Aurenche , his co-writer , he offers one of the most accurate and dazzling evocations of French History ever put on film . The trio of heavy-hitters , Philippe Noiret , Jean-Paul Marielle and Jean Rochefort are outstanding as Regent , Rebel and Abbe respectively and it's interesting to find Thierry Lhermitte making an early appearance as a Nobleman which is more or less casting against type . The Sun King is dead but the intrigues with which his Court was riddled lives on and it is the nuances which delight rather than any set-pieces . This is definitely one to savour and will surely stand up to repeat viewings .
Loaded For Baer	This is a slightly uneven entry with one standout sequence involving an over-the-hill gang reminiscing in the diner that once - thirty years previously - was their hideout ; one ho-hum duologue between two ageing rock musos ; a noirish kidnap turned on its head and an opening sequence ( plus epilogue ) involving heist artist wannabe Edward Baer and current ' hot ' property Anna Magloulis which has its moments . No movie in which Jean Rochefort appears can be dismissed lightly and here he shines as one of the over-the-hill quintet , indeed the film is worth seeing for Rochefort alone but each of the sequences has something to offer and it's definitely worth a look .
Wails Of Loneliness	I have a feeling - though I hope I'm wrong - that this is one of those films that are hugely enjoyable on an initial viewing but somehow don't always hold up if seen later . I'd include in this group Ordinary People , The Station Agent , Garden State and Sideways . Apparently this movie is seriously autobiographical , indeed one person writing here was actually a student of Baumbach senior and has vouched for the authenticity of the portrait painted by his son . It's a classic combination of laughter and tears and it would be churlish to praise any of the four principals above another ; the highest praise I can give is to say that I had the feeling I was watching a sophisticated documentary starring a real dysfunctional family rather than scripted fiction albeit autobiographical fiction and that if I snuck back into the movie theatre at three in the morning the family would still be up there dysfunctioning for America . An excellent film .
Best Of The Badmen	It is a fact universally acknowledged that a movie that makes a noise at the box-office is apt to beget a sequel whether it originates in England ( Carry On , Sergeant ) or The US ( Police Academy ) , sequels which in turn beget sequels ( Carry On . . . , Halloween . . . ) growing progressively inferior . Occasionally , however ( French Connection II ) a sequel will stand comparison with the original and this is the case here . Les Ripoux was a runaway smash on its release not least by virtue of the quirky pairing of Philippe Noiret and Thierry Thermitte and the twisteroo of an old hand guiding a rookie not through the path of righteousness but that of corruption . This time around they are undone when they carry greed a tad too far but there is another twist in store ; they are suspended , natch , but their replacements are worse then they ever were so what we have is , as the title suggest , garbage versus garbage . There can , of course , be only one ( technically two , for the benefit of pedants ) winner but it is the journey that provides the fun and it does no harm at all that Michel Aumont has a supporting role as their immediate boss .
Small Talk	We've been in this adult - thrown - together - with - child territory before and not that long ago with Le Papillon and La Belle Marthe , both excellent examples of the genre . This has elements of both but is closer in locale and for want of a better expression meet-cute to Le Papillon inasmuch as the protagonists in Marthe were not only related but also the same sex , Aunt and Niece , whilst in Le Papillon the child was more or less neglected by her single-parent mother and so latched on to Michel Serrault and here a similar set-up obtains albeit one with a slight twist . We establish that Etienne Vollard ( Olivier Gourmet ) is both a mountaineer and a used-book seller , not the most credible combination but hey , this is a movie , right , and similarly establish that Pascal Blanchot ( Marie-Josee Croze ) is a single mother with a genuine affection for her daughter Eva ( Bertille-Noel Bruneau ) but not much of a clue about motherhood itself ergo she falls asleep in front of TV when she should be collecting Eva from school . Eva subsequently attempts to make her own way home , panics when she gets lost and runs in front of Etienne's van . For a while she is comatose in hospital and the doctors urge Pascal to talk to her constantly but little more than a child herself - at one point she describes herself to Etienne as a child with a daughter - Pascal opts out and it is left to Etienne , a part-time savant who retains every word he's ever read , to do the honours . In time Eva recovers consciousness but will only walk if Etienne holds her hand . Pascal finds work in another town and prevails upon Etienne to maintain visits to Eva as he is , in effect , the only game in town . When Eva's condition deteriorates he drives to the town where Pascal is working and takes her to the hospital but halfway there she asks him to stop the car and promptly seduces him . Employing what is perhaps an unorthodox form of therapy Etienne wraps Eva in a blanket and takes her mountain climbing in a snowstorm . He himself freezes to death but Eva makes a full recovery . This is actually a very fine film and the acting is top class so that it holds your attention despite the questions that demand answers like why no mention of Eva's natural father , how can Pascal run a car and a reasonable apartment with no visible means of support and why is there apparently no man or men in the life of a 28 year old woman who may not be a raving beauty but is neither a graduate of the Kennel Club . Reference is made to Etienne being an ex-alcoholic and wife-beater but only enough to tantalize and make us wonder at these contradictions in one persona - mountaineer-bookseller may give us pause but VIOLENT bookseller ? As I said both the acting and technical credits are first rate and I'd certainly see it again .
Summertime And The Livin ' Is Easy	Looking at the reviews already posted it appears that some of the negatives are from purists looking for the perfect jazz film which , by definition , doesn't exist . As someone who tends to favour ' modern ' as opposed to ' trad ' jazz I can live without the Big Maybelles and Mahalia Jacksons of this world thank you very much but this wasn't sold as ' Modern ' Jazz On A Summer's Day or even ' Trad ' Jazz On A Summer's Day but simply Jazz On A Summer's Day with Across The Spectrum being tacitly understood so if I have a problem with Big Maybelle , Chuck Berry , Mahalia Jackson etc I can , on the DVD , fast forward , certainly on any subsequent viewings but initially I was happy to watch it all and get the most from the wide selection of styles . The film was made two years after MGM utilised the Newport Jazz Festival as the background to High Society and in that film Louis Armstrong and his All Stars were meant to be appearing at that year's festival and here Life Imitates Art as Armstong and his All Stars are featured performers . For me the cutaways which include the Americas Cup work well and the whole is an aural and visual delight .
Scent Of A Woman	Alain Chabat is a fine actor , writer and director but maybe a trifle misguided to take an ' idea ' credit for a story that probably had them rolling in the aisles when Aristophanes was still learning that it's ' i ' before ' e ' except after ' c ' . But , like I said , Chabat is a fine actor and he can do charm when he needs to . I'm also gradually overcoming an aversion to Charlotte Gainsbourg who also turns in an accomplished performance . If you absolutely insist on knowing , the ' plot ' is the one about the guy well into his forties and more than content to be single . This doesn't sit well with his mother and five sisters and to get them off his back he makes an ' arrangement ' with the sister of a colleague to pose - for fifteen thousand euros - as his new girlfriend , allow the romance to come to fruition with a wedding and then jilt him , thus getting him off the hook . Naturally they wind up together but along the way there's some sub-Benedek and Beatrice duelling and all things considered it's a pretty painless ninety minutes and performing so well at the French box office that a sequel may not be out of the question .
The Pleasure's All Ours	Max Ophuls is rightly regarded as a major filmmaker and this is a major work . If you'd heard of his fluid camera-work but hadn't seen a film bearing his signature this film would illustrate perfectly what people mean by his fluid camera-work . In 1952 the portmanteau film was hardly new ; in England we had seen both Quartet and Trio ( a joke in the early fifties had two hippies walking down Broadway and passing in turn cinemas where these titles were playing : One says ' Man , we better dig this crazy combo , it's fading fast ' ) followed by Encore , all featuring short stories by Somerset Maugham but it's fair to say that all three liked the visual style and sheer sumptuousness that Ophuls brings to DeMaupassant . Framed by The Mask and The Model the piece de resistance is The House of Madame Tellier , a four-reel examination of the role of the bordel in the provincial town - when they close for a day the whole sub-social life of the town is disturbed . If the lion's share of the plaudits go to the middle segment the others have more than their own individual moments and staples of French cinema like Jean Gabin , Danielle Darrieux and Simone Simon get to strut their stuff and pay their dues . A visual delight .
Still In A Fair State	Rodgers and Hammerstein were nothing if not shrewd and though they have often been spoken of as innovators they were not averse from ' borrowing ' from other sources . In 1944 , one year BEFORE State Fair , MGM released ' Meet Me In St Louis ' a wonderful ' family ' oriented movie which starts by introducing the cast as they sing the title song ; a little later there is a scene in which most of the family ' taste ' a soup being prepared by mother ( Mary Astor ) and pass comments on it . So : in this movie we begin by introducing neighbour Percy Kilbride as he drives along singing the title song , soon taken up by ' Pa ' Charles Winninger ; within minutes we have a scene in which mom ( Fay Bainter ) is seen making the mincemeat she will enter at the State Fair . Pa comes in , tastes it and declares it needs ' flavoring ' with brandy . In both cases the State Fair action is truncated possibly to avoid embarrassing comparisons with St Louis but otherwise this remains a charming film , redolent of a lost era with four competent leads - though none , of course , comes even near the magic of Judy Garland - and no less than six excellent and familiar supporting players - in addition to the aforementioned Bainter , Kilbride and Winninger there are Henry Morgan , Donald Meek and Frank McHugh . The story is soap-bubble fragile and the songs for once from this duo are ALMOST schmaltz-free though frustrated poet Hammerstein was unable to resist having a bird ' throwing his heart at the sky ' . Dick Haymes has the best voice in the movie by a country mile - with both Jeanne Crain and Dana Andrews being dubbed and Vivian Blaine sounding no better and no worse than dozens of other ' band ' singers of the time - whilst It Might As Well Be Spring is arguably the best song Rodgers and Hammerstein ever wrote . All in all it's a very pleasant nostalgic revel .
DeKlein And Fail	Losey's early Hollywood work included The Dividing Line and The Boy With Green Hair and Mr Klein contains elements of both inasmuch as he is still saying that if you're ' different ' you'll wind up paying the price . He seems to have taken a leaf out of Jean-Pierre Melville's book and shot the film in muted , autumnal color which lends an ironic touch of austerity to the story of a man who deals in fine Art and lives a sumptuous lifestyle . Other posters have dealt both with the plot and its Kafkaesque overtones so it would be superfluous to repeat that here . Like the majority I found it an excellent effort and for a French film buff like me the pleasure was enhanced by a glimpse of Gerard Jugnot , a great cameo by Louis Seigner , a telling appearance by Michel Aumont , an all-too brief couple of appearances by the wonderful Suzanne Flon and Michael Lonsdale in fine form as Klein's lawyer . The Biter Bit element MAY be a tad obvious and overdone , true , but Delon's central performance plus the contributions already mentioned help take the edge of this whilst the startlingly effective opening of a naked woman submitting to an examination in order to prove her non-Jewishness is somewhat wasted by not being effectively linked to the main story but these are minor quibbles from one who has always found Losey somewhat overrated but who thoroughly enjoyed this late offering .
The Wheat From The Chaff	We're definitely on the fringe of ' classic ' country here . A screenplay by those two masters Jean Aurenche and Pierre Bost adapting in turn a novel by Colette , direction by Claude Autant-Lara and in the lead role the legendary Edwige Feuillere , a combination just made to upset Francois Truffaut and needle him into throwing his toys out of his pram . Tough , Francois ; too bad you didn't take a closer look at how the big boys do it before inflicting your juvenilia on us . But enough of poseurs let's get down to the nitty-gritty . Watching today it seems incredible that at the time ( 1954 ) this caused something of a scandal dealing as it does with love , to say nothing of sex , between a callow teenager and the effortlessly elegant , chic , sophisticated and dare I say it , beautiful and luminescent Feuillere . Questions do occur , mostly why , when she is all these things , is Feuillere actually available for teenage initiation , why isn't she fending off at least a dozen admirers , and why does she pick on someone as unprepossessing , gauche and scrawny as Philippe ( Pierre-Michel Beck ) and , if it comes to that , how come someone as nerdish as Beck has a delectable girlfriend of more or less his own age in the shape of Vinca ( Nicole Berger ) . Ultimately it doesn't matter because the combination of great writing , direction and acting from ' the lady in white ' make this a movie to treasure .
Auclair de la lune	Henri Decoin and Danielle Darrieux made some wonderful movies together whilst they were married ( 1935 - 41 ) and Bonnes a tuer shows that divorce did nothing to destroy their peculiar magic . Top-billed Darrieux has only marginally the lion's share of screen time and for reasons best known to himself - or the Front Office - Decoin used one French Actress ( Corinne Calvet ) who had been resident in Hollywood since 1949 and made the bulk of her films there and two Italians ( Miriam de San Servolo , the real life sister of Claretta Petacci who was hanged with her lover Mussolini at the end of the war ) and Lila Rocco as the three other women in the life of Michel Auclair , who has gathered them together for dinner in his penthouse overlooking the Champs Elysee and thoughtfully weakened the safety barrier . The suspense comes from knowing , via the opening scene , that SOMEONE is lying on the sidewalk wondering who has the oxygen concession and we want to know who , natch . Master that he is Decoin begins as the camera dollys in to the empty dining room of the penthouse resplendent with crisp napery , cutlery and glassware and ends the film with a dolly OUT of the same scene . Within this main flashback are others as three of the four women remember incidents from their past with Auclair and Decoin skillfully racks up the tension throughout but more so after Darrieux discovers that the safety barrier has been tampered with . This has everything the discerning viewer wants from a film and the mystery is why , with films as good as this being turned out in the mid fifties those cowboys from Cahiers were ever allowed to perpetrate their ANTI-films a couple of years later but the good news is that the new wavelet soon became merely a trickle and lives on today only in the work of Erich - come - and - let's - watch - paint - dry Rohmer .
Bye , Bye , Blackbird	It's a real joy to see this on the big screen again in the correct aspect ratio as part of the Bogie season at the NFT . Apart from the occasional dated slang - ' gunsel ' for example , a word that was probably clumsy even at the time - the snappy dialogue holds up well and feels as though it may have been ahead of its time in 1941 . A typical early exchange comes in the wake of Archer's murder when , after ascertaining that Archer was following Floyd Thursby Barton MacLane's cop asks Bogie ' Why was he tailing him ? ' to which Bogie replies ' He wanted to find out where he lived ' in that laconic way he practically patented . The plot itself is fast moving and reasonably intriguing but watching it today most of the fun is in the ensemble playing and spotting Hollyood regulars like MacLane , Ward Bond , Gail Patrick , Elisha Cooke , etc plus the finest threesome since the Nat King Cole trio in Bogie , Lorre and Greenstreet . This was Huston's first stint as writer-director and arguably he never eclipsed it .
Shop Talk	Having recently watched Duvivier's 1925 ' Silent ' Poil de Carrotte I was more than prepared for the mastery on display here , some five years later . The very first shot of a train bringing Denise from the provinces is worthy of Renoir's La Bete Humaine and trains don't really figure in the story so this was merely Duvivier flaunting his skill , as well he might . By coincidence the Zola novel on which this is based is part of the sequence containing La Bete Humaine so who's to say that it wasn't Renoir - working several years later - who sought to link the two via locomotives . I tend to agree with other notices here regarding the acting though we have to remember that back then acting was , of necessity , what today we would describe as ' hammy ' or over the top . This does not apply to the lead , Dita Parlo , so unforgettable in La Grande Illusion , who was a fine actress with relatively few credits . The story - big business versus the Little Man - is , of course time-honoured and Duvivier tells it splendidly in fluid camera-work laced liberally with opticals . A must-see .
Humble Pie	It's difficult - though not impossible - to be critical of a film when you know going in that the writer / director was murdereed shortly before its release . Essentially this is the kind of film you're able to enjoy even whilst notching up its flaws . Essentially Adrienne Shelley's mantra is ' aren't men beasts ' and there's nothing wrong with that as a point of view , indeed , there is even more than a grain of truth in it but we part company in the way she stacks the deck by creating an Angelic character verging on the Saintly and saddling her with a Neanderthal husband . A girl as attractive and intelligent as Jenna wouldn't stay with a control freak like Earl for five minutes in the real world , let alone rushing to prostrate herself beneath his foot every time he yells ' heel ' , and a guy like Earl , who shows no sign of having anything resembling an IQ couldn't possibly earn enough money ( significantly we are never told what he actually DOES for a living ) to own such a well-appointed house , car , etc , at a relatively early age . As noted , however , these flaws don't get in the way of the simple pleasures of an undemanding chick flick in which ( almost ) everybody lives happily ever after .
Green Cards	The protagonist of Irwin Shaw's second and sadly neglected novel , The Troubled Air , is a liberal radio producer at the time of the McCarthy witch-hunts who draws flak from both the Right and Left because of his stance on the actors , writers and technicians he employs . In some ways Roger Richebe ' was similar ; a fine writer , director , producer , he came under fire from both the New Wavers and the Old Guard . It's not difficult to understand why he upset the Godard set given that they detested anyone with more talent than themselves - and in Godard's case , of course , that meant everyone - but I for one am frankly bewildered by the Old Masters who should have embraced him as one of their own . In L'Habit Vert he takes on the Acacemy Francaise , that august body who , for centuries , have guarded the French Language as fiercely as Sicilian brothers guard a sister's virginity . They are cards to a man and Richebe has lots of fun showing them in all their petty vanities . Jules Berry seldom ventured into comedy - at least in my experience - and it is a joy to see him do so here in a ' camp ' performance that may well have been used by Peter Lorre as a template for his Joel Cairo in The Maltese Falcon . Pierre Larquey is also on hand and delivers one of his more than reliable performances as does Bernard Blier in a much smaller role . A gem .
Perchance To Dream	Along with the original ( Dick Powell ) version of Farewell , My Lovely this initial adaptation of The Big Sleep is light years ahead of subsequent adaptations of Chandler novels - and it's highly debatable if the Michael Winner travesty of The Big Sleep should even be included in the set . Only those who have read and delighted in the book would perhaps take exception to the changes , not all of which can be excused on grounds of censorship - for example in the book the elder Sternwood daughter had been married to Sean Regan and Marlow learned at first hand that Carmen had shot Regan when she tries the same stunt on him - whilst viewers who lack the comparison will find much to enjoy in the crisp writing , directing and acting . Too much has been written already here for me to need to replicate it so suffice it to say that this movie's reputation as a Classic is well deserved .
KeepIt Under Your Hat . . .	' ' ' but Tell No One is quite an effective policier . It was made more enjoyable for me when the likes of Nathalie Baye , Jean Rochefort and Brigitte Caitillon popped up seemingly out of the blue but playing slightly more than cameos . Francois Cluzot carries the bulk of the movie as the pediatrician whose childhood sweetheart turned wife is the victim of a serial killer . He copes after a fashion with the help of Kristin Scott-Thomas until eight years later when he begins to think his wife may still be alive . This is just the start of a labyrinthine series of events that rack up the tension . Andre Dussollier is also on hand as is the director himself . Though it differs in plot this is the best French policier since 36 , Quai des Orfevres ( Olivier Marchal who directed the former is also in this as an actor ) and highly recommended .
The Price Is Right	Trivia buffs may find it interesting or even ironic that this film is set in 1844 and stars Vincent Price who , though a fine all-round actor achieved perhaps his greatest fame in a series of film adaptations of the stories of Edgar Allan Poe made in the 1960s , stories that Poe was writing around the time that Dragonwyck takes place . By the mid forties Mank had written and / or produced dozens of films but had only only one obscure title under his directorial belt but following the death of Ernst Lubitsch who was contracted to direct Dragonwyck Mank stepped in and never looked back . Arguably more at ease with contemporary stories - A Letter To Three Wives , All About Eve , The Barefoot Contessa etc - he tried ' period ' once more - if we don't count Julius Caesar and Cleopatra - and again with Gene Tierney in The Ghost and Mrs Muir and pulled it off both times . Tierney and Price had been engaged to be married in Laura and this time they actually make it to the altar which is not the same as saying it ends happily . Gothic is , by definition , formulaic and most of the elements are present and correct , rugged setting , large , mysterious house , wide-eyed ingenue , ambiguous leading man by turns charming and sinister . For good measure we also touch on social history in the shape of the ' patroons ' of whom Price is a representative . A strong supporting cast does no harm at all ; Ann Revere trots out her stoic mother , Walter Huston weighs in with a bible-reading farmer , Harry Morgan attempts to incite rebellion against the patroon system - which was abolished four years later anyway - and Spring Byington and Jessica Tandy ( literally only months away from creating the role of Blanche DuBois on Broadway ) complete an excellent cast . For Mank completists this is an essential movie .
I Liked It ; That's The Gospel Truth	There's something nicely symmetrical in the fact that this movie was adapted from a play by Maxwell Anderson . Almost forgotten today Anderson began his career with the Broadway hit play What Price Glory ( c0-written with Lawrence Stallings ) . Produced in 1924 and twice filmed it was , of course , set in World War One and was a comedy about the love-hate relationship between Flagg and Quirt , sergeant and private . Twenty years on Anderson was more philosophical as perhaps befits someone with a penchant for writing in blank verse . He also turned his hand to writing lyrics and collaborated twice with composer Kurt Weill on Knickerbocker Holiday and Lost In The Stars , neither exactly laff riots though the former did produce the evergreen September Song . By 1944 the was was definitely swinging in the favour of the Allies but this didn't guarantee that no blood was spilled . Farmboy William Eythe is the main protagonist but both his family , sweetheart , and his platoon get plenty of screen time and equit themselves well , not least Ray Collins , usually a belligerent banker / politician but here subdued as Eythe's farmer father . Ann Baxter may be wasted as Eythe's girl back home but there is a nice ensemble feel to the whole thing . Dated , perhaps , but still worth a look . . )
If The Slipper Fits . . .	This is yet another Depression Era take on Cinderella - not for nothing is is the David Niven character named Merlin - designed to take people's minds off both the recent austerity and the global war waiting in the wings . What comes across strongly is the sheer professionalism from all Departments , Script , Directing , Acting , that almost succeeds in preventing awkward questions - the film begins on what Americans insist on referring to as ' the day before Christmas ' , known to the rest of the world as Christmas Eve , with Ginger Rogers being made redundant from her temporary salesperson position at Merlin's Department Store ; due to plot machinations the son of the owner of the store ( David Niven ) is moved to reinstate her and the continuity implies that she goes back to work the next day ( Christmas ) - etc . The character played by the reliable and prolific Frank Albertson ( so memorable in It's A Wonderful Life ) fluctuates between up and down like a dysfunctional yo-yo but it's a safe bet that no one in 1939 noticed any of this and were content to bask in the high Enjoyment factor . Even today it holds up pretty well if only perhaps for one first-time viewing .
Vale Of Tears	Despite credits on several ' important ' feature films gay director Irving Rapper ( or , if you will , Puff Daddy ) was never much more than a journeyman but with Bette Davis , Claude Rains and Gladys Cooper on set it would have been difficult to screw up and Casey Robinson's script includes a worthy contender ( along with Some Like It Hot ) for number # 1 spot in the Last-Line Hall Of Fame in the shape of Davis's ' don't ask for the moon , we have the stars ' . At the time Rapper probably won brownie points for the before-and-after complementary shots of Charlotte's ( Bette Davis ) feet ; first , in our initial introduction to her , they are clad in ' sensible ' shoes and she is soon revealed in a dowwdy ' spinster ' dress which tells us all we need to know about her character ; later , after a lightning transformation at the hands and in the clinic of Claude Rains Rapper gives us another shot of her feet , descending a staircase on a cruise liner and this time they are encased in fashionable pumps just as she herself , when we see her a moment later , is dressed in the height of sophistication . This whole business is accomplished in little more than two reels or twenty minutes or so of screen time and though it would have been difficult to actually show the miraculous treatment she received it would also , especially when seen today , sixty years later , have given a little more credibility to a plot whose target audience is the average Redbook reader . Like most films of the period ( it was released in 1942 ) it was ' meaty ' , plot-heavy with lots of opportunities for a large supporting cast , notably the ever reliable Mary Wickes , to shine . It's the kind of film that could have ended at several points - Charlotte's triumphant homecoming for example - but keeps on extracting extra mileage . If we feel today slightly cheated by the omission of the treatment in the clinic this also applies to the huge potential of the clash of personalities between the born-again Charlotte and her mother the cold , ruthless martinet , played to a fare-thee-well by Gladys Cooper , but with other , more romantic fish to fry , Cooper is killed off after just one exchange of caustic dialogue which promises an interesting power-struggle it fails to deliver . We need look no further than Charlotte Vale and her mother for Terence Rattigan's models for Sybil Railton-Bell and HER domineering mother in ' Separate Tables ' . Perhaps best remembered for the ' two-cigarette trick , where Paul Henreid places two cigarettes in his mouth , lights them both then gives one to Davis , this is yet another outstanding example of Hollywood's Golden Age and distributors are to be applauded for issuing a Boxed Set of Four Davis movies with not one dog amongst them - for the record these are : The letter , Now , Voyager , Dark Victory and Mr Skeffington , a real bargain in any currency .
Badger Game	It's superficially easy to ' read ' this 1941 entry centering on greed as a metaphor for the Teutonic hunger / greed for power but I'll leave that to the academic pseuds . This is simply a brilliant filmic interpretation of a classic play - Ben Johnson was writing out of London around the same time as Shakespeare - and features a director , Maurice Tourneur and two leading players , Harry Baur and Louis Jouvet , at the top of their games . For good measure there's also strong support from Fernand Ledoux and a great time is had by all . Tourneur switches effortlessly from crowd scenes to duos and trios and Armand Thirard's camera-work is exemplary which may explain why Tourneur took him to Continental that same year . This is a going away .
Natural Selection	In 1935 writer-director Henri Decoin married actress Danielle Darrieux and they celebrated by offering the public their first film together La Domino Vert . In 1941 in the wake of their sixth film together , Premiere Rendez-vous , they divorced and Darrieux subsequently married Porfirio Rubirosa but between 1935 and 1941 they made some of the finest films in French cinema including Battement de coeur , Retour a l'aube , Mademoiselle , ma mere and this one , Abuse de confiance which sees Darrieux's studies for the Bar languishing in the wake of her grandmother's death . Unable to find work that doesn't involve putting out for the boss she finally follows the advice of a friend and claims to be the natural daughter of celebrated novelist Charles Vanel . Plot-wise that's about it but Darrieux lit up any screen she was on as well as being a great actress and Vanel was not exactly chopped liver if anybody asks you and as icing on the cake Darrieux is finally called to the Bar and gets to make an impassioned speech in court . Now available on DVD this is not to be missed .
Two Days , Five Stars	We have yet another great French female triple-threat as Julie Delpy hits one out of the park in her first At Bat . We knew of course that she was a first-rate actress and a worthy Oscar winner for her screenplay of Before Sunset but now she shows that she's an equally talented director as well ( and for good measure she also cut the film , composed the background music and sang over the end credits ) . She now takes her place in the distinguished company of Danielle Thompson ( writer-director ) , Toni Marshall and Ann Fontaine ( both of whom have seemingly abandoned acting to concentrate on writing-directing ) , Nicole Garcia , who still continues to act albeit for other directors rather than herself , Valerie Lemercier , who acted in two of the three films she has written and directed to date , and last but very far from least Sophie Marceau and Valerie Bruni-Tedeschi , both of whom have second films on release ( Marceau ) and awaiting release ( Bruni-Tedeschi ) and she fully deserves her place in that brilliant pantheon . 2 Days In Paris is a wonderful melange of comedy that rivals Lemercier and drama the equal of Garcia , Marshall , Fontaine , which makes it heady wine indeed . Delpy does not shy away from satiric digs at both French and Americans and makes herself the butt of several negative points . Her real life parents Marie Pillet and Albert Delpy contribute sterling support as well they may with something like 150 movies between them including Lucie Aubrac , Ridicule , Tandem , Mon Meilleur Ami , Le Colonel Chabert and Le Mari de la coiffeuse so that something considerably more than nepotism is at work here . These are REAL people as opposed to the cardboard cutouts that populate so much Hollywood dross , and their problems are equally real and not the sort that can be solved with a quick sentence or two in the final moments but rather those that will persist long after the characters ' screen lives have faded to black . This is an auspicious debut any way you care to look at it and I await the DVD release impatiently .
Get Me To The Church On Time	This is yet another of those films set in an England in which no one I have ever met actually lived in or remembers and which all of us should be allowed to live in just once in a lifetime . Esther McCrachan's original play was a hit at Wyndham's in the late thirties and a revival starring Sarah Churchill closed at the Colisium on Saturday , September 2nd , 1939 and that pre-war spirit is captured to a fare-thee-well by Terence Rattigan's adaptation and Puffin Asquith's direction . The cast , led by Margaret Lockwood and Derek Farr includes Marjorie Reynolds reprising her stage role as the mother of the bride and if Wally Patch is a trifle suspect as a magistrate that's about the only jarring note in what remains a charming quintessential English film . Only a tad short of a perfect .
In A Lonely Place	As first feature films by French Female Directors go this is right up there with La Buche , Il Est plus facile pour une chameau , Parlez-moi d'amour , Se Souvenirs des belles choses and Le Gout des autres and it may be no coincidence that Anne Le Ny acted in the last three and clearly kept her eyes and ears open . This is a very assured debut with traces of Brief Encounter and Rien a Faire and just as Noel Coward provided interesting and solid support for the protagonists of Brief Encounter so Le Ny surrounds her German teacher and graphic artist with the proprietress of a magazine-stand and her assistant and a sister and step-daughter for the male protagonist . Le Ny herself plays Nathalie , the caring sister of Betrand and throws in a lovely moment involving Nathalie's baby son and a second involving her older daughter that illustrate just how firm is her grasp of this ultimately bittersweet love story . Manu Devos and Vincent Lindon do everything asked of them and more and the whole thing has the feel of a labour of love from all concerned . Try not to miss it .
Cold War Thriller	Henri Decoin , a great unsung French director , was never better than when directing Danielle Darrieux and the proof lies in the nine top-class movies they made together both during and after their six-year marriage ( six during , three after ) ; indeed if one were seeking a new definition of ' civilized ' you could do a lot worse than cite this working relationship . With a nice touch of irony Francois Donge ( Jean Gabin ) lying in a hospital bed after wife Elizabeth ' Bebe ' ( Danielle Darrieux ) has slipped a little mercury where it will do the most good and forgiven her instructs her to continue planning their tenth wedding anniversary , whereas in real life Decoin and Darrieux were celebrating the tenth anniversary of their divorce . At 34 Darrieux was at the height of her powers and as radiant as any actress on any screen in any world . The script requires her to progress from wide-eyed idealist to bruised maturity and she takes it in her stride . They could have saved a mint on the budget because Darrieux wears Balmain throughout and this is rank extravagance on an actress who can make a Woolworth's dress look like Balmain . In the cold war aspects of the relationship Gabin turns in a prototype of the relationship he would enjoy with Simone Signoret in Le Chat although that relationship lacked light relief . Everyone is on top of their game here , Decoin , Gabin , Darrieux and Gabrielle Dorziat who punctuates the action like a good fairy who's been nobbled . I can't praise this one too highly . A gem .
Moor , Moor , PLEASE !	If you would seek some kind of perspective on the Motion Picture industry you could do worse than study the career of old Awesome ; a string of masterpieces - Kane , Chimes At Midnight , Touch Of Evil - and nearasdammit masterpieces - Ambersons , Mr . Arkadin , Journey Into Fear - which he either wrote , directed and appeared in , sometimes all three , liberally laced with the trash in which he deigned to act - The Black Fox , Ferry To Hong Kong etc - in order to finance projects like this one , which belongs right up there with the masterpieces . I note that much verbiage has been spilled under this title on IMDb debating and disputing the pros and cons of the ' restored ' version and whether or not it was indeed ever ' lost ' . This is surely academic at best ; what matters is that we now HAVE a close approximation of what Awesome intended and frankly if it were any closer I couldn't stand it . The pre-credit sequence alone is worthy of one of the great Silent masters , Gance , Dreyer and like that and the first shot proper is magisterial . Time and time again Welles uses the landscape to compose startling images only to contrast this with key speeches like ' farewell the tranquil mind . . . ' which he shoots more or less straight and who else but Awesome could make such a virtue out of necessity as in the scene slated for conventional filming until the costumes failed to turn up ; his solution , stage it in a bath-house with the actors wearing towels which were themselves borrowed from their hotel . It was Welles himself who made the finest Shakespearean film of all time in Chimes At Midnight and with Othello he runs it a close second . Unmissable .
Killing Mockingbirds	It's difficult to believe that the Robert Enrico who made Les Aventuriers also made Au Couer de la vie a decade previously because the two are chalk and cheese having only directorial talent in common . A cynic may remark that Enrico had been frightened by Max Ophuls after noting the way his camera is seldom if ever static , circling the action constantly , creeping through the woods like a Comanche war party surrounding settlers but fluid camera-work is only one of the stylistic strings on Enrico's bow . He has taken three stories by Ambrose Bierce all illuminating some aspect of The War Between The States ( 1861-64 ) , often erroneously labelled the American Civil War , and melded them into a powerful - all the more so because it is largely silent - anti-War statement . All three stories blur the boundaries between reality and the supernatural and the first segment ' Mockingbird ' is the ideal introduction to the concept when a soldier , rewarded for bravery with a furlough , falls asleep and dreams of a Past that is still in the Future and all too soon becomes the Present . The second segment ' Chickamauga ' is a tour de force in which the actual battle is unseen but ' felt ' by a deaf-mute child who subsequently plays among the dead victims and induces them to rise and follow his reverse Pied Piper in a danse macabre . The last segment ' An Incident At Owl Creek Bridge ' was widely shown in the 1960s as a ' short ' and is arguably the most lyrical of the three ; a condemned man is hanged from the eponymous bridge and dropped into the river where , miraculously , he is able to free himself and out-swim the bullets of the hanging detail . Joyously he runs all the way home to the arms of his waiting wife but then . . . This is yet another neglected masterpiece that separates the men of Real French Cinema from the boys of the new wavelet which , by 1963 , was barely a trickle and as dbmonteuil has said in his own perceptive review another one or two films of this quality around 1958-61 and the nouvelle vague wouldn't even have been a joke .
To The Victor . . . The Spoils	Anyone who loves French cinema is likely to salivate just reading the Opening Credits of this entry . Despite propaganda to the contrary films begin with SCREENPLAYS - show me the ' auteur ' who can shoot a ream of Blank paper and I'll show you someone who doesn't exist - and here we have not only Charles Spaak , one of the four ( together with Jean Aurenche , Henri Jeanson and Jacques Prevert ) Outstanding writers of the early Sound-to-post-War French cinema but also Albert Valentin whose work on Boudu Saved From Drowning was uncredited but went on to write ' La ciel est a vous ' ( also with Spaak ) , ' La vie de plaisir ' and ' Le Mouton a cinq pattes ' and directed three of the finest films in French cinema , ' L'Entraineuse ' , ' Marie-Martine ' and ' La Vie de plaisir ' . Behind the camera was Jean Gremillon , often consigned to footnote status in the reference books but a very fine director indeed who had already released ' Dainah Le Metisse ' and ' Guele d'amour ' and would go on to shoot ' Remorques ' , ' Lumiere d'ete ' and ' Le Ciel est a vous ' among others . Towering above the cast was Raimu ; outside France it was Jean Gabin who received all the attention and this was not undeserved as he was an exceptional actor but WITHIN France Raimu was the ' man ' . An accomplished stage actor he had already made a handful of silent films when he replicated his stage performance in Marius , the first episode of the great Marcel Pagnol trilogy and from then on his career as a star of the screen was assured . Closely associated with Pagnol he worked also with many of the top French directors running the gamut from tragedy to comedy . Playing his wife here was Madeleine Renaud , also an accomplished stage actress who would become Gremillon's favorite actress and appear in three more of his finest films , Remorques , Lumiere d'ete and Le Ciel est a vous . If the opening credits activated the taste-buds the film itself delivers a banquet with Raimu as the essentially mild businessman who allows himself to become tainted by organized crime but attempts to extricate himself when his much younger wife ( Renaud ) presents him with a son . Inadvertently he kills the mobster who is leaning on him but a totally innocent man , Bastien ( Pierre Blancher ) is found guilty and draws ten years in the slammer . The film then becomes an early psychological study of a good man dealing with guilt and growing apart from family and friends . In a wonderful twist Blancher escapes after serving just over half of his sentence and Raimu takes him in thus forming an unwitting menage a trois ( Blancher's own wife , Viviane Romance , had quickly divorced him following his incarceration , leaving him free to fall for Renaud ) . In 1938 this was a very sophisticated screenplay which is acted to the hilt and remains one of the most satisfying accomplishments of thirties French cinema . Once again my thanks to the Norwegian guy without whom . . .
What's Up , Doc	Seeing this movie for the first time yesterday I was struck by the commanalities it shares with Philippe Lioret's L'Equipier ; both share a location , Ouessant , both feature a lighthouse and both deal with outsiders coming in to close-knit communities . Indeed if Academics ever contemplated abandoning their lofty Ivory Towers temporarily and risk an attack of the Bends by putting a tentative gilded toe in the waters of Popular film they may even discover that Gremillon also made Remorques in which the sea figured prominently and that Lioret used a lighthouse motif in Mademoiselle but let's leave the Academics ensconced in their Spatial Relationships and return to the real world of craftsmen built movies . This entry came when Gremillon's career was coming to an end and it's a lovely swansong infused with delicate melancholy set in a close-knit community in which ironically no one is really happy or even content . There's a lovely moment when Marie ( Micheline Presle ) has toiled for hours through the night at the bedside of a sick girl who has finally , with the doctor's help , turned the corner . Her reward is more than money ' I take my hat off to you , doctor ' says one of the bystanders thus sealing her acceptance at last into the community ; as she walks home through the deserted streets the beam from the unseen lighthouse keeps playing over the walls and we think subconsciously of the hundreds of prison and prison-camp movies we have seen where a similar light seeks out those attempting to Escape but THIS light is celebrating Marie's acceptance INTO the community . Later she will travel in a rough sea to that same lighthouse and operate successfully on one of the keepers reinforcing her role in the community and Gremillon shoots the scene masterfully ; with a camera fixed in the cabin of the lifeboat we see only what the helmsman would see and initially this is only the sea washing over the deck as the ship pitches and tosses but gradually we are able to discern the lighthouse itself moving in and out of shot and slowly growing larger . In 1954 Gremillon probably found it prudent to cut from this scene to Marie safely inside the lighthouse and climbing the stairs but some 50 years later Lioret was able to show the transition from ship to rock in detail . One of the strengths of the film is that Marie has a secondary problem to cope with in the shape of an engineer , Andre Lorenzi ( Massimo Girotti ) , with whom she falls in love but who as a macho Italian takes it for granted that once married Marie will be happy to give up this foolish idea of work and be more than happy to devote herself to the chores of the housewife and to her shame there is a moment when she accepts this but after the exhilaration of the operation in the lighthouse Ordinary Housewife is no longer an option . The film is rich in observation of human nature with a nod to Jeux Interdits in the sequence where two children , both of whom were loved by the spinster schoolteacher who had devoted a lifetime to the local school , ignore her funeral in favour of a sick pet sheep . This is a wonderful slightly Chekhovian film that has been unjustly neglected .
Red Sails In The Sunset	I've just been reading some of the comments posted here and I couldn't find a single pan which makes me very pleased because I can only add my voice to those others who have heaped praise on this remarkable and truly wonderful film . This is one of those films that works no matter which angle you approach it from ; as multi-layered as an onion , as absorbing as a Mozart quartet , as fluid as quicksilver and as unforgettable as Citizen Kane . Kieslowski was clearly a genius at pegging the Human Condition and it is fitting that this turned out to be his final film because he'd have had a hell of a time topping perfection . For reasons best known to himself it's also the only one of the three to feature a genuine heavyweight male actor in Jean-Louis Trintignant and the males among us surely owe him a vote of thanks for showcasing three of the most beautiful as well as talented French film actresses - respectively Juliette Binoche , Julie Delpy and Irene Jacob - in his three colours trilogy . Much has been written here about the story , technique etc and it would be superfluous to repeat it , suffice it to say this is a masterpiece and leave it at that .
They Won't Take THIS Away From Me	This is undoubtedly one of the best that Fred and Giner made at RKO in glorious black and white and it's singular inasmuch that one is able to wallow in the melodic melodies and literate lyrics whilst simultaneously marvelling at what Depression audiences would sit still for in terms of credibility . All three writers - Lee Loeb , Harold Buchman ' story ' and Ernest Pagano ' screenplay ' - racked up dozens of other credits - Pagano worked on four other Astaire movies , Carefree , again with Ginger , A Damsel In Distress , You Were Never Lovlier and You'll Never Get Rich - and presumably wrote all five screenplays in the same colander . Consider : The story opens in Paris ; Astaire , dancing star of a Russian ballet troupe , is happy to stay there where he hopes to meet Linda Keene ( Rogers ) an American entertainer with whom he has fallen in love . Impresario Jeffrey Baird ( Edward Everett Horton ) wants Petrov ( Astaire ) to return to New York and dance at the Met but Petrov is adamant . Then , he meets Keene and learns she is sailing the very next day ( from Paris , mind you , on a Liner , yet ) on the Queen Ann so without further ado he informs Baird that he ( Petrov ) will sail to NY the next day . Just like that . No advance booking necessary , just turn up with your troupe of Russian dancers and yes , of course , you can have a couple of dozen staterooms at a couple of hours notice . More ? Halfway across the Atlantic , Ginger , teed off with Fred , persuades the captain to allow her to leave on the plane that comes to collect air mail for New York . Yes , you heard . A plane lands on a liner in the middle of the Atlantic as a matter of course to collect mail . More ? Gee , you're tough to please , but okay . The first real song and dance number occurs in the engine room of the ship and this is an engine room where you could eat off the highly POLISHED floor even as you marvel at the pristine art-deco pistons and other paraphernalia . Forget Gene O'Neill and the realistic engine rooms he was putting on stage a decade earlier in such plays as The Long Voyage Home , The Hairy Ape , etc , THIS is an engine room where grease , oil and dirt are strictly forbidden . More ? Listen , there IS more , lots more but enough already . I only mention these little things so I can now say they don't MATTER . This is escapism , pure and simple . A great , great score boasting , in addition to the title song , Slap That Bass , Let's Call The Whole Thing Off , They All Laughed , I've Got Beginner's Luck and the immortal They Can't Take That Away From Me . Eric ' Slow Burn ' Blore divvies up the laughs with Horton and a wonderful ( but , alas , now lost ) time is had by all .
Black And Blue Red	Julien Duvivier had been directing for five years during which he'd turned out ten titles before this , his eleventh in 1925 and though I shouldn't be surprised - I have , after all , seen and / or own the majority of his Sound films - at the sheer craftsmanship and quality that permeates every frame I'm lost in admiration for a true Master . Stunning visuals abound and the title-cards are spare and to the point , Redtop's mother is shown , crone-like and a title card says it all , nasty gossip . Soon we are introduced to the eponymous Carrot Top , her youngest son , and here Duvivier superimposes stunning images of his tormentors onto the sheet of writing paper in front of him as he sits at his desk in school . The use of Opticals throughout is breathtaking for the time and enhance what is basically a Cinderella story with a happy ending . The novel was clearly close to Duvivier's heart because he filmed it again in 1932 with a cast that was more well-known , Harry Baur , Margaret Fontenay and Robert Lynen but apart from Sound there is little to choose between two brilliant films .
Well-Met By Starlight	Anyone who saw this on its initial release in 1952 would not have been surprised when Sinatra unveiled his considerable ' acting ' chops in his very next movie , From Here To Eternity for Meet Danny Wilson is a perfect Halfway House between the gauche Clarence in Anchors Aweigh ( typical of all Sinatra's roles in the 40s , with the possible exception of Miracle Of The Bells which extended his range only to the extent of putting him in a dog-collar ) and Maggio in Eternity . Here is the Sinatra the real fans knew and admired , primarily a great singer but also a flawed human being , volatile , arrogant , brash . Don McGuire weighs in with a tasty script with some great zingers and uses just enough material from Sinatra's real life to please the cognoscenti . A rare title today but one central to the Sinatra collection and unmissable .
Peck's Bad Boys	It's often a mistake to revisit a film that one has enjoyed , admired or even loved in one's youth as so many times a second visit makes you wonder what you ever saw in it first time around and if , in the meantime , a film has achieved cult status the odds against it holding up grow progressively slimmer . What a relief , nay , what a JOY to find that this film has , if anything , grown in stature moving me once again to tears . Having always admired Gregory Peck and been bemused by how underrated he was I was delighted when this magisterial performance was rewarded with an Oscar , one that he could have picked up for Twelve O'Clock High , The Gunfighter , Roman Holiday and post-Mockingbird Captain Newman , MD . Like Jack Lemmon and Alan Ladd - who , it has to be said , was an actor with a limited range - Peck embodied decency so that in many ways Atticus Finch , the father everybody wishes he had and / or SHOULD have had , WAS Gregory Peck in period costume . Like all great films the strength begins with the writing and here a perfect novel that belongs up there with The Great Gatsby becomes a perfect film , transposed from one medium to another with great finesse by Horton Foote . Not since Mickey Rooney learned the major lessons of life at the knee of Judge Hardy in another small town has moral education been so easy to take ; it's difficult if not impossible to find anything negative to say about this masterpiece which glitters and gleams from the opening credits and first bars of its haunting theme . Beyond praise .
Beyond Sunset	Although I long ago taped every Billy Wilder movie off TV I can't resist seeing them again on the Big Screen as part of the Wilder retrospective running at the NFT in November and December . Every movie Wilder wrote and directed was on the Great side of Good but seeing all the titles in print in a brochure reinforces just how many GREAT movies he made . Somehow he contrived to make two back to back just as the forties gave way to the fifties and then damned if he didn't do the very same thing as the fifties in turn became the sixties . The first two were Ace In The Hole and Sunset Boulevard , the second Some Like It Hot and The Apartment and I've yet to mention Double Indemnity ( only his THIRD At Bat as a writer-director in America ) , The Lost Weekend , Stalag 17 , Sabrina , A Foreign Affair , One , Two , Three , etc . If ever a film NOT made by Orson Welles had ' masterpiece ' written all over it Sunset Boulevard is that movie . Every frame is touched with genius and in this film Wilder elevates Biting The Hand That Feeds You to an Art Form . Everyone and his Uncle Max knows by now the story of how third-rate writer Joe Gillis ( William Holden ) fetches up in the Gothic manse of has-been Screen Goddess Norma Desmond ( Gloria Swanson ) and winds up as a gigolo and ultimately a dead gigolo but over and above the storyline it is the ' touches ' that make this so great both in dialogue ( Betty : How've you been keeping yourself lately ? Joe : Actually I haven't been keeping myself lately ) and visuals : Norma Desmond represents a bygone era and ironically it is Cecil B DeMille ( playing himself ) who tells Norma how far pictures have progressed and is THEN revealed to be directing wearing the riding breeches which were de riguer for movie directors IN THE SILENT ERA , a wonderful , typical and classic Wilder statement . It would be superfluous to merely repeat what other posters have said here but we can never repeat the word Masterpiece too often in connection with this movie .
At The End Of The Day . . .	. . . this has to be ranked as one of the finest films about Acting as a Profession and Actors as human beings . Noel Coward gave us his own take on the subject in his 1960 play Waiting In The Wings and whilst he may have got more mileage out of his multi-layered title - " The Wings " is the name of the theatrical Retirement Home where Coward's actors wait to die and , of course , actors wait in the ' wings ' of a theatre for their cue to enter - he didn't eclipse this great Duvivier-Spaak collaboration shot in the shadow of World War II which gives it yet another strata . Duvivier was at his best with large ensembles and here he excels once again with a cast largely unknown outside France with the obvious exception of Michel Simon , outstanding as the joker of the establishment but living a lie inasmuch as he spent his entire career as an understudy rather than an actual performer , and Louis Jouvet , the Errol Flynn-lite ageing swordsman . Whilst the ensemble may be relatively unknown to non-vintage French film buffs they will be a revelation to anyone stumbling on this movie by chance ; Spaak and Duvivier chronicle all the minutiae of egos trapped by age and condemned to live out their days together like members of a Touring company in Blossom Time , back-biting , fighting over scraps of food , reliving their triumphs , boring others and being bored BY others . A barrel of laffs it's not but it IS a masterpiece . ( Once again I am hugely indebted to the guy from Norway who is so generous with his massive film library .
