HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD ( Bruno Mattei , 1980 ) BOM	I knew I was in for a laugh-riot with this one , but the film had the unenviable distinction besides of boasting a narrative which paired what are perhaps my least favorite horror / exploitation subgenres ? the flesh-eating zombie and jungle / cannibal variety ! Watching it , then , I couldn't decide what was more revolting ? the gore , the abundance of ( often irrelevant ) stock footage , or the ineptness of it all ! Director Mattei is often compared to Ed Wood ; this has been my first film from him , and I can't say that opinion is too far off the mark ! Despite Goblin soundtrack ( albeit sub-standard and reportedly recycled from their 1978 ZOMBI score ) and a pathetic attempt at a political message , this is as close to the nadir of " Euro-Cult " as I've ever come across ; there may have been others just as laughable and bad , but the emetic splatter factor here really does it no favors at all ( much as I admire Romero's NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD [ 1968 ] ? though not so much the sequels ? I sincerely lament the determining influence it had in taking the horror genre towards visceral , indeed voyeuristic , excess which we've had to suffer from for the last 40 years or so ! ) . Anyway , here we get much the usual ingredients ( pardon the pun ) : a virus outbreak contaminating a Third World country unleashes apparently unlimited legions of the living dead in no time at all ? with only a quartet of stereotyped gung-ho soldiers ( including lone-wolf captain , ladies ' man second-in-command , blood-thirsty badass and nervous comic relief ) to fight them off , though they're eventually joined by a female star reporter and the inevitable tagalong cameraman ( sporting a full head of hair as if he's just stepped out of some rock concert ) . At 101 mins . , it doesn't take long for this relentlessly dull ride to become unbearable ; besides , a lot of the running-time is devoted to nauseating rituals by the natives in an attempt to ward off the zombie plague ! The heroes , in fact , have to pass through a jungle crammed with the pesky creatures in order to reach the factory from where the virus originated , only to meet more of the same and their own demises ? the girl's fate is dealt with in particularly excruciating detail , which is the kind of scene to justify accusations of misogyny that are leveled at the horror genre from time to time ( yeah , the ending of this one is pretty bleak ? but who cares ? ! ) . I could go on about how indescribably awful this flick was , but I figure I've wasted enough of my time ( and yours ) over it already . . .
THE BODY STEALERS ( Gerry Levy , 1969 )	Abysmal sci-fi ( an unwise change of pace for Tigon ) which , up to this point , had been the low point of Anchor Bay UK's " The Tigon Collection " - not that there were any particular highs ! Michael Armstrong , director of THE HAUNTED HOUSE OF HORROR ( 1969 ) - and who was eventually replaced by Levy - compared it to Ed Wood in his Audio Commentary for that film , and I can't say that he was too far off the mark ! A competent cast flounders in the face of an inane premise and lackluster handling : veterans George Sanders , Maurice Evans ( as the chief villain / alien ) and Robert Flemyng ; heroes Patrick Allen and Neil Connery ( yes , Sean's younger sibling ! ) ; starlets Hilary Dwyer ( better suited to period pieces like her three films with Vincent Price - WITCHFINDER GENERAL [ 1968 ] , THE OBLONG BOX [ 1969 ] and CRY OF THE BANSHEE [ 1970 ] ) and Sally Faulkner ( I was impressed by her in VAMPYRES [ 1974 ] and PREY [ 1977 ] , and here looks lovely if nothing else ! ) . However , Lorna Wilde is terrible as an alien temptress ( ! ) - and the ( mercifully brief ) contribution of Shelagh Fraser as Mrs . Thatcher ( ! ) , an ageing nymphomaniac barmaid with a shrill voice , is positively embarrassing ! ! One of its most hilarious - and dated - aspects is the way it presents Allen and Minister's aide Allan Cuthbertson ( ! ) as a couple of would-be studs , in obvious imitation of the James Bond extravaganzas ; the cheesy score ( by Reg Tilsley , who fared better with THE HAUNTED HOUSE OF HORROR ) doesn't help , either . A measure of the film's sloppiness is the fact that Hilary Dwyer's name has been mysteriously omitted from the cast list at the end of the picture , though I doubt she voiced her complaint about it to the production company ! Patrick Allen's Audio Commentary is actually quite engaging though , understandably , he offers little insight into the film itself - given also that he doesn't remember much at all about its making , and had never even watched the damn thing until now !
TARZAN , THE APE MAN ( John Derek , 1981 )	Surely one of the most ill-advised remakes of a classic in film history – especially since the promise of its tag-line , " The most beautiful woman of our time in the most erotic adventure of all time " , isn’t even properly exploited ! Although this film was regularly shown on TV in my neck of the woods since my childhood days , its notoriety ( for awfulness not erotic content , mind you ) kept me away from it until now – and I only relented because I have recently enjoyed Bo Derek’s previous film , 10 ( 1979 ) , and have been watching a lot of fantasy stuff as well over the Christmas period . Lead actress / producer Bo Derek is rather ridiculous playing the schoolgirl-ish sexual innocent ( witness the inept banana scene ) and , as was to be expected , she is made to get her clothes off a few times but , as welcome as these scenes were , she came off as far more sensual in 10 than she does here ; Richard Harris , then , chews the scenery incessantly as Jane’s obsessed explorer father , but John Philip Law barely registers as his aide who meekly shows some initial interest in Jane herself ; newcomer Miles O’Keeffe has the title role and he only makes his entrance 45 minutes into the movie , is completely silent throughout except for his famous yodel ( which is probably lifted from Johnny Weissmuller anyway ! ) and , furthermore , is as inexpressive as one of the trees he dangles from at regular intervals throughout the film’s second half ! ; for the record , he later starred in two ATOR movies ( or would-be CONAN imitators ) for Joe D’Amato and the King Arthur-era set , SWORD OF THE VALIANT ( 1984 ) . When still an actor , director John Derek ( who also serves as his own cinematographer here ) had worked with some good film-makers ( Cecil B . De Mille , William Dieterle and Robert Rossen ) and a few great ones ( Otto Preminger , Nicholas Ray and Don Siegel ) but he clearly learned zilch from them as his direction of this one is a major liability : appallingly pretentious at times ( witness the perfectly horrid python attack sequence ) with a senseless overuse of the slow motion technique and cheesy transitions ; this was Derek’s seventh film as a director ( and his second of four with wife Bo ) and , eventually , he would only get to make two more . The film’s utter failure only needs to be gauged by the fact that the Tarzan legend was tackled once more on film – in GREYSTOKE : THE LEGEND OF TARZAN , LORD OF THE APES ( which , surprisingly enough , I haven’t watched myself yet ) – a mere three years later ! ! Nominated for six Razzie Awards ( including John Derek , Richard Harris and Miles O’Keeffe ) and winning one for Bo Derek herself , TARZAN , THE APE MAN was co-written by Gary Goddard , the future director of another highly anticipated but ultimately disappointing transposition to the silver screen of a ( this time animated ) heroic figure , MASTER OF THE UNIVERSE ( 1987 ) which I will be revisiting presently as well ( yay ) ! Despite a charming closing credit sequence showing Tarzan and Jane playing with around with an orang-utan and a music score that is not half bad actually and quite rousing on occasion , any belated good intentions are defeated by an extremely silly climax involving natives painting Bo completely white and , fatally , John Derek’s clear disinterest in the character of Tarzan himself which makes him come off as an unimportant supporting character in his own self-titled movie ! !
THE ICE PIRATES ( Stewart Raffill , 1984 )	After missing out on this innumerable times on TCM UK , I decided to check it out given its sci-fi / adventure / camp pedigree : I knew I’d be in for a thoroughly silly ride – but it was also astoundingly bad ! Anyway , perhaps appropriately given the characters involved , the script rips off many sci-fi titles then of recent vintage – SOYLENT GREEN ( 1973 ) , ZARDOZ ( 1974 ) , LOGAN’S RUN ( 1976 ; to the extent that it was filmed on some of the self-same sets ! ) , STAR WARS ( 1977 ) , ALIEN ( 1979 ) and MAD MAX 2 : THE ROAD WARRIOR ( 1981 ) ! The plot is simple but not exactly engaging : from the title one can deduce that water has become scarce on the planet where all of this takes place – so our ragtag buccaneer heroes take it upon themselves to steal ice blocks from the tyrannical Templar ( ! ) rulers . Also involved is a beautiful princess ( Mary Crosby , daughter of Bing ! ) in search of her father , the deposed king ; by the way , the cast includes another famous offspring : Anjelica Huston ( daughter of John ) as one of the pirate band – thankfully , the actress’ mistake in accepting such a role would soon be forgotten in the wake of her winning an Oscar ( under her father’s guidance , no less ) for PRIZZI’S HONOR ( 1985 ) . Since STAR WARS had Peter Cushing as the " Supreme Commander " , the film-makers opted to have a screen legend of their own – 78-year old John Carradine ( who’s seen strapped to a sort of operating table during his one brief scene ! ) . The most notable bits ( for all the wrong reasons ) are : the alien using the toilet ; the castration machine ; the clumsy antics ( including karate-style combat ! ) of the inevitable robot companions ; the goofy slave / eunuch make-up worn at one point by the heroes ; the recurring attacks by the " space herpies " ( whatever that is ) ; the climax in which the characters are made to age when going through a time-warp ( Crosby becomes pregnant , gives birth , and sees her son grow up in the space of 30 seconds , while leading man Robert Urich himself is replaced by John Ford stalwart Hank Worden for this scene ! ) – incidentally , the jump-cuts adopted here ( intending to denote the rapid passage of time ) are not only unsuccessful but downright irritating .
JAIL BAIT ( Edward D . Wood Jr . , 1954 )	Not as well-known as Wood's notorious ' horror ' output but this truly lamentable attempt at a film noir - demonstrating , if only in its ramshackle production values , an affinity with the cinema of Orson Welles and Edgar G . Ulmer - is at least equally inept and hilarious , if still emerging as perhaps his most tolerable effort ! It's practically a manual on how NOT to make a noir : despite a generous dose of hard-boiled - yet godawful - dialogue ( particularly in the scenes depicting the gangster's constant bickering with his moll ) , the film has absolutely no sense of atmosphere , a headache-inducing and inappropriate score , an irrelevant musical number ( in blackface , to boot ! ) and some of the worst , most amateurish acting you're ever likely to see ! Perhaps the main culprit in this regard is elderly Herbert Rawlinson ( who , amazingly , kept working on such rubbish when he was dying of lung cancer and , in fact , kicked the bucket a day after production wrapped ! ) as an eminent surgeon who has to contend with a delinquent son ; the latter gets embroiled in armed robbery and murder and is subsequently killed by his associate , after the surgeon persuades him to give himself up to the Police . However , the gangster blackmails the old man into doing a makeshift job of plastic surgery in order to avoid capture - but , in perhaps the most uproarious scene of the entire film , the doctor discovers his son's corpse in the gangster's kitchen , without so much as a reaction , and decides to turn the tables on him . While not unpredictable , I must say that the twist ending works . . . but , unfortunately , the TV reception got screwed up during the last few minutes of the film , so I missed out on some of the details ! By the way , the younger of two cops who tail Rawlison's son throughout the film is none other than future peplum icon Steve Reeves in his film debut - and he looks as uncomfortable in a suit and tie as Chuck Heston ! !
Charlie Chan And The Curse Of The Dragon Queen ( Clive Donner , 1981 )	Abysmal would-be spoof of the well-loved series of films featuring the Oriental detective , possibly made in the wake of ( and a very long way from ) the runaway box-office success of Neil Simon's MURDER BY DEATH ( 1976 ) . The few bright moments provided by Chan's old flame Lee Grant and befuddled cop Brian Keith are completely sunk by the fatal miscasting of Peter Ustinov ( who is truly terrible here and should have stuck to portraying Hercule Poirot ) , the painfully unfunny antics of his accident-prone son Richard Hatch and the absurd histrionics of Grant's faithful maid Rachel Roberts . The cast also features Angie Dickinson ( underused as the Dragon Queen of the title ) , Roddy McDowall ( as a wheelchair-bound and vaguely sinister butler ) , Michelle Pfeiffer as Hatch's fiancée and Johnny Sekka . Ironically , the film's story writer / producer Jerry Sherlock currently runs the Hollywood branch of The New York Film Academy ; thankfully , I hadn't watched this mess before I embarked on their eight-week film-making program late last year ! Besides , I suppose the fact that director Clive Donner had previously helmed the uncontrollable WHAT'S NEW PUSSYCAT ? ( 1965 ) should have been fair warning against this one . . .
ZETA ONE ( Michael Cort , 1969 )	I believe I first became aware of this sci-fi / sexploitationer via the biography for actress Valerie Leon included among the extras on the Anchor Bay DVD of Hammer's superior BLOOD FROM THE MUMMY'S TOMB ( 1971 ) ; incidentally , the film under review was made by rival company Tigon . To begin with , the script was apparently inspired by a comic strip ( such cinematic adaptations were all the rage at the time ? no doubt , the makers were encouraged by the success of BARBARELLA [ 1968 ] ) . Still , even reading through the cast list , I knew not to raise my ' artistic ' hopes too highly ? given that it featured both James Robertson-Justice and Charles Hawtrey , stalwarts of ( respectively ) the popular " Doctor " and " Carry On " comedy franchises ? who actually turn out to be the villains of the piece ! ! The narrative drew heavily on another then-current fad i . e . espionage ? in fact , the hero is a stud-like albeit laid-back secret agent who naturally proves irresistible to the alien women ( actually , an alternate moniker for the film ) the titular figure ( played by veteran Dawn Addams ) sends his way in order to derail his investigation into the abduction of several earth girls . That said , the plot is barely there and becomes especially confusing ? not to say silly ? during the latter stages ; for what it's worth , the film culminates in a chase wherein the otherworldly gals kill virtually all of their male pursuers simply by pointing their fingers at them ( accompanied by the incongruous noise of gunshots ) ! ! Needless to say , ZETA ONE's raison d'etre and prime asset is its relentless parade of innumerable but anonymous starlets of the era in the nude or otherwise scantily-clad : the above-mentioned Valerie Leon herself is underused , but fellow future Hammer lead Yutte Stensgaard ? who engages the hero ( to whom he's recounting his non-exploits ) in a lengthy and decidedly irrelevant game of strip-poker ? comes off quite well ( no pun intended ) . Also worth mentioning are the low-budget but appropriately psychedelic sets and the title tune ( featuring a reasonably effective guitar riff ) .
TRENCHCOAT ( Michael Tuchner , 1983 ) 1 / 2	The only reason I decided to check this one out was because it’s set in Malta ; the result , however , was an exceedingly feeble comedy-thriller from , of all people , the Disney stable and , needless to say , a long way behind Hitchcock . Incidentally , this was the film which forced the studio to open a parallel label – Touchstone – so that they could make more adult-oriented fare : its few moments of violence and the appearance of a man in drag , presumably , were the offending elements in this regard ! The title is the typical outfit worn by the detective hero of 1940s film noirs : here , it’s incongruously donned by the irritating would-be thriller novelist Margot Kidder ( ! ) – while the boyish-looking Robert Hays is the typical undercover agent ( whose mission is to catch a ring of plutonium-traffickers ) . I can’t say the script-writers / film-makers were particularly inspired by the Maltese locations – so much so that it could have been set practically anywhere else to much the same dismal effect ( it’s simply not thrilling and certainly not funny ) ! Most of the other characters are seen either aiding or harassing the two leads – sometimes they seem to be doing one when their intention is actually the opposite ; these include clumsy assassin Leopoldo Trieste , laid-back police chief David Suchet ( TV’s future Hercule Poirot ! ) , a couple of sweet old lodgers at Kidder’s hotel , a German mystery woman , and a Sicilian stud . A notable appearance is put in by John Justin ( yes , the hero of the classic Michael Powell / Alexander Korda THE THIEF OF BAGDAD [ 1940 ] in what amounted to his last feature-film role ! ) as the long-suffering aristocratic owner of the hotel , whose place is turned upside-down by the end of the film . By the way , I only spotted two Maltese actors of stature in bit roles – one played a guide at a museum , and the other a fishmonger who helped Kidder evade her pursuers in one scene . For what it’s worth , the identity of the villains is ingenious ( if not exactly original ) ; in the end , though , in spite of a number of chases , the film is never as engaging ( or enjoyable ) as it should have been . . . and only manages to give a bad name to the genre it’s playing at , not to mention the people and country involved !
HANDS OF STEEL ( Sergio Martino , 1986 )	This is typically low-grade , silly sci-fi fare with unconvincing special effects and a particularly wooden lead ( Daniel Greene ) . The supporting cast features three Euro-Cult regulars : John Saxon , George Eastman and Claudio Cassinelli ( whose last film this turned out to be as , unfortunately , he was killed in a helicopter crash during shooting . . . but , at least , he manages to preserve his dignity ! ) . With a script in which a female scientist is hilariously named Dr . Peckinpah , the would-be dystopian elements of the plot ( amusingly , the old popular leader is both blind and wheelchair-bound and his fate is even neglected by the film's end ! ) are jettisoned early on in favor of mostly tepid action sequences ( including several irrelevant arm-wrestling bouts and bar-room brawls , a duel of cyborgs in which Greene fights a big blonde bimbo draped in a plastic bag [ ! ] and an interminable climax capped by chief villain Saxon handling a huge laser gun ! ) . Furthermore , the film's attempts to humanize the cyborg lead ( anticipating , amazingly enough , ROBOCOP [ 1987 ] ! ) are pretty dire . . . but , at least , it's slightly better than Martino's own 2019 : AFTER THE FALL OF NEW YORK ( 1983 ) - in which , similar to this , the desert location-shooting provided a cheap way of enhancing the film's production values !
THE DEVIL'S WEDDING NIGHT ( Luigi Batzella , 1973 )	This is another disreputable " Euro-Cult " item of the Horror / Erotica variety : its director , in fact , is likened to Renato Polselli ? whose vaguely similar THE REINCARNATION OF ISABEL ( 1973 ) I recently watched . Mind you , this is nowhere near the incomprehensible mess that ISABEL was ? but the plot also concerns vampires , sacrificial victims and lookalike protagonists ( in this case , Mark Damon as twin brothers ) . It all starts with the search for the mythic Ring of the Nibelungens , currently residing in Transylvania ( ! ) ? which , of course , is the home of Count Dracula . When one of the Damons goes there , he finds a Countess ( " Euro-Cult " starlet Rosalba Neri ) living in Castle Dracula ; having lost his protective amulet , he soon falls under her spell and is himself turned into a bloodsucker . Soon after , though , his twin turns up at the castle but , being the more studious of the two , he resists Neri's advances and , thinking something's not right with the place , spends a good part of the running-time roaming its various corridors and , naturally , the crypt ( virtually a given for Gothic chillers ) ! As it turned out , the brothers happened to pick the time when five local virgins are to be sacrificed ( presumably for the reincarnation of Dracula ) ; the film's most erotic yet visually impressive sequence , as a matter of fact , shows the blood of a freshly-slain girl being spilled on the naked Countess ? residing in one of the crypts ? by her zombie-like black maid ( yes , various horror myths are thrown in for no very good reason and with little real impact ! ) . Anyway , it all ends with the afflicted Damon being initiated into the ways of the vampire ? but he's actually been disposed of and replaced by his heroic sibling who , in no time at all , manages to disarm the various diabolists ( who turn up out of nowhere ) at the ceremony . Meanwhile , Neri retreats to the castle tower and , with the aid of the ring , draws the intended sacrificial victims to her ? but Damon disturbs her plans even here , and she eventually perishes thanks to some providential lightning . The hero leaves the castle with a local girl he had befriended but , in a clichéd downbeat conclusion , she has been turned into a vampire ( off-screen ) as well ? given that the driver of the coach is none other than the sinister-looking character occasionally seen prowling the castle grounds ? To be fair , the tone of the piece is characteristically dream-like and it all looks pretty good for the little budget the director must have had at his disposal ; on the other hand , being at once insufficiently-plotted and highly derivative , it's not memorable enough to live in the memory .
WHAT'S GOOD FOR THE GOOSE ( Menahem Golan , 1969 )	Norman Wisdom's final starring vehicle was a departure from his previous outings ? bringing his accident-prone milquetoast up-to-date , this being a product of the Swinging Sixties ! The end result is an uneasy and occasionally embarrassing comedy which mixes the star's typical slapstick ( and sentimentality ) with mild sexuality and even milder satire ; the plot has to do with an executive on a trip for a banking conference falling for teenager Sally Geeson ( who doesn't mind getting involved with him but doesn't take their relationship all that seriously either ) ; Sarah Atkinson appears as Geeson's friend who warns Norman of her fickle character . The film is nowhere near as bad as Leonard Maltin's BOMB rating would have it and , if anything , is interesting for its treatment of mid-life crisis ( being in many ways similar to Hoffman [ 1970 ] and 10 [ 1979 ] ? both of which , incidentally , I've only just watched ) ; towards the end , Norman even tries to bring his wife round to his new way of thinking ! The Pretty Things appear as themselves performing a number of good tunes in a nightclub and Norm himself sings the catchy title track !
Critique de La Separation ( Guy Debord , 1961 )	Documentarian Guy Debord is an avant-garde film-maker whose work , on exposure , has left little personal impact : this short is a tortuously didactic treatise on the conflicting relationship between film and reality . Initially , his ‘poetic’ narration and haphazard ( at times , even subliminal ) juxtaposition of images – a blend of stock footage ( most of it , predictably , of a topical / political nature ) and stills ( one of which , amusingly , derives from Fox’s juvenile swashbuckling romp PRINCE VALIANT [ 1954 ] ! ) – proves arresting , being vaguely in the style of contemporaries such as Resnais and Godard . However , the film eventually overstays its welcome ( despite only running 17 minutes ) because the director seems to think that pretentiousness will carry itself ! ; for the record , this broadcast of CRITIQUE DE LA SEPARATION was preceded by an over-hyped trailer for it .
The Heart Is deceitful Above All Things ( Asia Argento , 2004 )	Argento's second directing effort is as self-indulgent as the first but , at least , the American setting and some surprise cameos give it a more ' professional ' look . With regards to her personal contribution , she would perhaps have done better to give the role she eventually played to another actress ? so that she would have concentrated on the directing ? but , at least , her tenure in the U . S . has undoubtedly improved her English ! Still , as was the case with SCARLET DIVA ( 2000 ) , the film is basically a compendium of social and sexual disorders : the leading character is actually the son of the woman played by Argento ? incarnated in its various stages of growing-up by three different actors ! ? and he goes through parental neglect , bad influence ( from his free-spirited ? make that hooker ? mum and the various low-lifes she brings home or meets on the road ) and abuse ( of both the physical and sexual kind ) ! Perhaps its most excessive ? and would-be provocative ? episode is that featuring notorious rocker Marilyn Manson ( sans make-up ) when he seduces the boy who , having been ' transformed ' into a girl by his mother for no reason at all , he imagines to be Argento herself ! ! Then again , the film is extreme in its viewpoint : apparently , the only alternative to the unwholesome background provided by the boy's mother is that of a group of fanatical Evangelists ( headed by Peter Fonda and Ornella Muti , playing his grandparents ) ; there's a funny scene here , though : asked what psalms he knows , he says that he can't recite any but has learned the words of a few songs , promptly bursting into the Sex Pistols ' " Anarchy In The UK " ! Another hilarious moment ( perhaps unintentional ) comes with the obscene country song heard on the radio at one point . After 90 minutes of this , with the boy taken out of Argento's custody a number of times , they are re-united at the end and take once more to the road ? thus resolving nothing definitively , and making the whole venture more pointless than penetrating into the bargain ! Argento's interview on the R2 DVD I watched was a lucid and informative talk , but the accompanying one by the author of the book on which the film was based ? J . T . Leroy ? was a rambling piece which rather demonstrates that she is more adept ( and comfortable ) at communicating her thoughts via the printed page !
3 RING CIRCUS ( Joseph Pevney , 1954 )	As some of you may be aware , I’m no longer that much of a fan of Jerry Lewis – though I did acquire the Paramount 10-disc set of his vehicles recently ; growing up I watched a number of them ( and also a lot of his teamings with Dean Martin ) on Italian TV – and , not having checked out the latter in ages , I was wondering how they held up . Since I can easily lay my hands on the films released on DVD , I opted to give another look to one which , for some reason , has yet to appear on the format and which had certainly been among the first I became acquainted with all those years ago . I’ve watched scores of films over the years set inside a circus ( and should be getting to one more , THE BIG CIRCUS [ 1959 ] , presently ) ; many comic stars had tried their hand at this exciting and evocative milieu – so it was natural for Lewis ( and Martin ) to get in on the act as well . Jerry , of course , wants to be a clown but has to go through the ropes first – therefore , we see him as a lion-tamer ( ! ) and , with Martin in tow , sweeping the tents , washing the elephants and as an ice-cream vendor , etc . – inadvertently , he even does a tightrope routine on a bike ( ! ) . Soon enough , his antics are getting more laughs than those of the company’s star clown who , naturally , is jealous of all this attention – thus becoming mean in Jerry’s regard , and is generally so soused that he becomes unfit for work ! Another clichéd turn-of-events is the fact that the circus ( owned by Joanne Dru ) would be impoverished if it weren’t for a star attraction in the form of trapeze artist Zsa Zsa Gabor ; for this reason , she acts like a diva and , worse for Dru ( who , surprise surprise , is attracted to Martin ) , holds him under her thumb ! Helping Dru out is old-timer Wallace Ford – who purports to give the boys a hard time but , predictably , emerges to have a heart of gold underneath ; also on hand are Sig Ruman as the veteran lion-tamer and Elsa Lanchester as The Bearded Lady ! Martin ( and Lewis ) gets to sing a couple of resistible tunes , one of them to a bunch of caged animals ! ; the soundtrack , then , includes his hit from the previous year " That’s Amore " ( first heard in THE CADDY [ 1953 ] ) and the Paramount standard " Lover " ( from the superb Maurice Chevalier / Jeanette MacDonald musical LOVE ME TONIGHT [ 1932 ] ) . Anyway , at the bat of an eyelid , Lewis is awarded the spotlight of star clown ( without having really demonstrated any outstanding comedic skills ) , while Martin – who introduces a spot of gambling to aid the circus – takes over the joint when Dru decides to call it a day . Eventually , Lewis and Martin also quarrel over the circus’ customary show at an orphanage – which Dru returns to compere . . . but , all’s well that ends well , as Dino has a change of heart and turns up to sing for the finale ( following Jerry’s attempts to put a smile on a crippled girl’s face ) . As can be seen , the formula is typical Martin & Lewis : songs , girls , sentiment and Lewis’ love-it-or-hate-it shtick ; if anything , it’s certainly colorful and mildly entertaining along the way – but hardly a classic of screen comedy and , while clearly a popular title in the Lewis canon because he gets to don the clown make-up ( the film , in fact , was re-issued in a shortened version entitled JERRICO , THE WONDER CLOWN ! ) , not one of the better outings from the team .
BILLY TWO HATS ( Ted Kotcheff , 1974 )	Given the fact that it doesn’t have much of a reputation , I had missed out on this Western countless times on Italian TV ; however , since the film stars Gregory Peck , I was interested in it regardless – and , having last year caught up with SHOOT OUT ( 1971 ) , another minor genre outing from him , it was high time that I got round to this one as well . Most Westerns made during this time were Revisionist and elegiac in tone ; in this respect , screenwriter Alan Sharp seemed like the ideal choice ( having had already contributed THE HIRED HAND [ 1971 ] and ULZANA’S RAID [ 1972 ] ) : however , the end result is merely a pleasant-looking and oddly pointless affair ! The plot develops into one long chase as an elderly Scottish bank-robber ( Peck ) and his young half-breed companion / associate ( Desi Arnaz Jr . playing the titular character ) are doggedly pursued by Sheriff Jack Warden . Along the way , they meet up with a reformed criminal and his squaw ( the former , seemingly indebted to Warden , willingly joins him on the trail of the fugitive Scotsman – while the latter has compassion for the boy , who’s been caught but subsequently freed by Peck ) , a band of renegade Apaches , and an unhappy prairie couple ( having been wounded , the star requires the man’s help to procure a buck-board to travel in – while Arnaz stays behind to look after the farm and the owner’s nervous mail-order bride ) . The latter relationship is quite movingly handled : the two innocents fall in love , a situation which Warden can’t bring himself to understand when he turns up ; eventually , the trio take off to reach Peck – whose journey has been beleaguered with a raid by the traditionally hostile Apaches , and which has left him for dead . Ultimately , only the young couple survive : the woman pleads with the half-breed to be taken along , in spite of the intolerance this will undoubtedly provoke . Old-fashioned and essentially dreary , the film is nonetheless fairly tolerable while it’s on . Incidentally , Norman Jewison served as co-producer on this one : curiously enough , he would never tackle the genre in his more regular capacity as director !
MACHORKA-MUFF ( Jean-Marie Straub and Daniele Huillet , 1963 )	I’ve somehow never been drawn towards pursuing the work of these art-house film-makers ( even if a good many of them have turned up over the years on a specialized programme on late-night Italian TV ) ; having now , at long last , stumbled upon one of them I can understand why ! The premise of the 17-minute short , in itself , isn’t too bad – a number of former Nazi officials reconvene years later in order to bestow an honor upon a former colleague – but the treatment is so austere as to be alienating , resulting in a largely unappetizing film ! Intermittently , however , there’s an agreeable irreverence at work here : to begin with , all the Nazis have two surnames ( and always starting with the same letter , such as the titular figure ) ; a dream sequence in which the protagonist enters a museum and uncovers a statue atop a balcony of himself ; the illusion that military men can do no wrong because at no point in the Bible does Christ judge them ! ; the recipient of the tribute – a Major who had suffered dishonor , and subsequently died in exile , because his company suffered losses in combat amounting to a mere 8 , 500 men – has his reputation restored in the wake of an investigation which has firmly established that the death toll was actually in excess of 14 , 500 ! !
THE LAST HARD MEN ( Andrew V . McLaglen , 1976 )	This one came out during the Western genre’s last gasp ; unfortunately , it emerges to be a very minor and altogether unsatisfactory effort – even if made by and with veterans in the field ! To begin with , the plot offers nothing remotely new : James Coburn escapes from a chain gang , intent on killing the man ( now retired ) who put him there – Charlton Heston . While the latter lays a trap for him , Coburn outwits Heston by kidnapping his daughter ( Barbara Hershey ) . Naturally , the former lawman – accompanied by Hershey’s greenhorn fiancé ( Chris Mitchum ) – sets out in pursuit of Coburn and his followers , all of whom broke jail along with him . Rather than handling the proceedings in his customary sub-Fordian style , McLaglen goes for a Sam Peckinpah approach – with which he’s never fully at ease : repellent characters , plenty of violence , and the sexual tension generated by Hershey’s presence among Coburn’s lusty bunch . Incidentally , Heston and Coburn had previously appeared together in a Sam Peckinpah Western – the troubled MAJOR DUNDEE ( 1965 ; I really need to pick up the restored edition of this one on DVD , though I recently taped the theatrical version in pan-and-scan format off TCM UK ) . Anyway , the film is too generic to yield the elegiac mood it clearly strives for ( suggested also by the title ) : then again , both stars had already paid a fitting valediction to this most American of genres – WILL PENNY ( 1968 ) for Heston and Coburn with PAT GARRETT & BILLY THE KID ( 1973 ) ! At least , though , Heston maintains a modicum of dignity here – his ageing character attempting to stay ahead of half-breed Coburn by anticipating what his next move will be ; the latter , however , tackles an uncommonly brutish role and only really comes into his own at the climax ( relishing his moment of vengeance by sadistically forcing Heston to witness his associates’ gang-rape of Hershey ) . Apart from the latter , this lengthy sequence sees Heston try to fool Coburn with a trick borrowed from his own EL CID ( 1961 ) , the villainous gang is then trapped inside a bushfire ignited by the practiced Heston and the violent death of the two ‘obsolete’ protagonists ( as was his fashion , Heston’s demise takes the form of a gratuitous sacrifice ! ) . The supporting cast includes Michael Parks as the ineffectual town sheriff , Jorge Rivero as Coburn’s Mexican lieutenant , and Larry Wilcox – of the TV series CHiPs ! – as the youngest member of Coburn’s gang who’s assigned the task of watching over Hershey ( while doing his best to keep his drooling mates away ! ) . Jerry Goldsmith contributes a flavorful but , at the same time , unremarkable score .
SAMSON AND DELILAH ( TV ) ( Nicolas Roeg , 1996 )	This is the third version of the Biblical tale that I've watched - or fourth , if you include the peplum SAMSON ( 1961 ) ; the best of the lot , clearly , remains Cecil B . De Mille's 1949 spectacular . Since this is part of a series of made-for-TV films highlighting famous stories from the Bible , one is surprised to find a celebrated and talented director such as Nicolas Roeg involved - though they all managed to attract a vast array of international and upcoming stars . That said , Roeg's career has been steadily on a downhill slide ever since the mid-80s - surely one of the saddest declines in recent memory ! This film was actually written by the director's frequent collaborator Allan Scott ( including the masterpiece DON'T LOOK NOW [ 1973 ] ) , but the magic is seldom in evidence on this particular occasion - and the end result is as bland as its TV origins suggest . . . Even so , it's not entirely worthless if clearly overly-padded at a length of nearly 3 hours : while the look of the film is curiously drab , the star cast offers compensations - best of all , perhaps , are Dennis Hopper ( as a prescient Philistine General ) , Michael Gambon ( the Philistine ruler ) and Daniel Massey ( as a learned Jewish elder ) . Still , though Liz Hurley is ideally cast as Delilah , her performance is too modern - and , consequently , the character's ultimate redemption lacks conviction ; as for Eric Thal's Samson , the script may have made him more conflicted than Victor Mature's take in the De Mille version - but again , rather than evoke the traits one should associate with this Biblical character , the actor's boyish looks merely bring to mind the pumped-up heroes of juvenile sword-and-sorcery films and TV series of recent vintage . . . Incidentally , I only rented this because my father had been whining about " The Bible Collection " on DVD for months ( I brought him MOSES [ 1995 ] at the same time but , even if it featured Ben Kingsley , Frank Langella and Christopher Lee , opted not to watch it myself ) ; eventually , he too - who had caught many of Hollywood's classic historical epics when new - was ultimately unimpressed , and readily admitted that these newer incarnations offered no competition !
THE ROVER ( Terence Young , 1967 )	Given a very limited distribution ( despite the people involved ) this international production remains , even now , an obscure ( and unappetizing ) historical piece ; not all that much of a surprise , however , since it just isn't very good ? either as drama , adventure , or as an adaptation of the Joseph Conrad novel . Director Young was an expert at action ( having pretty much cemented the style of the James Bond extravaganzas ) ; however , this is a largely talky and stodgy affair ? which , perhaps in keeping with the film's very title , doesn't seem to know where it's headed ! Ennio Morricone provides the suitably melancholic music ; the main cast seems impressive on paper but , for the most part , it has very little to work with here ? resulting in generally awkward performances . The titular seafaring character is played by Anthony Quinn ? a veteran of ( much better ) pirate sagas , such as the prime THE BLACK SWAN ( 1942 ) , the vintage AGAINST ALL FLAGS ( 1952 ; with which I should be re-acquainting myself over the next week-end , incidentally ) and the similarly meaningful but more successful A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA ( 1965 ) ? whose exploits , typically for the larger-than-life actor , end in self-sacrifice ( albeit a recurring motif in the author's fatalistic work as well , as can be judged from the likes of " Heart Of Darkness " and " Lord Jim " ) . Rosanna Schiaffino has the most difficult ? and self-conscious ? part as the unstable yet voluptuous woman ( whose odd behavior is eventually explained in a brief flashback ) protected by Quinn from harassment by the locals and the lustful attentions of her ageing ' guardian ' . For an actress who had been the personification of allure and glamour , Rita Hayworth is here saddled with an unenviable frumpy look and , even worse , a thankless characterization ( by the way , she and Quinn had last appeared together 26 years previously in BLOOD AND SAND [ 1941 ] ) ! Richard Johnson's earnest officer , then , supplies belated antagonism to Quinn in the fields of both romance and patriotic duty ( the setting is post-Revolutionary France ) .
MURDERERS’ ROW ( Henry Levin , 1966 )	Having managed to acquire this one soon after THE SILENCERS ( 1966 ) and THE WRECKING CREW ( 1969 ) , I can say that , while a definite comedown from those two Matt Helm adventures directed by Phil Karlson , it’s fairly enjoyable in itself and far from the " uncontrolled disaster area " the late eminent critic Leslie Halliwell took the sequels to be ( though I haven’t been able to get my hands yet on THE AMBUSHERS [ 1967 ] , considered the worst in the series ) . Things start off nicely enough with the elimination of all the top I . C . E . agents : Helm’s photo has him taken from the back – thus making his undercover activity later within the enemy ranks seem more plausible – but , amusingly , amply displaying his fondness for booze and broads . The villain this time around is played by Karl Malden , while Helm’s women include Ann-Margret ( as the daughter of an inventor of a deadly ray being held captive by Malden ) and the latter’s assistant Camilla Sparv ; the girls both look good but aren’t given a lot to do – besides , Ann-Margret relies too much on the energetic dancing style she had displayed in the Elvis Presley vehicle VIVA LAS VEGAS ( 1964 ) . . . though this does result in a funny scene inside a nightclub where Martin has a hard time trying to ape ( and keep up with ) her irrepressible moves ! Incidentally , despite the set-up at the end of THE SILENCERS with respect to the upcoming contribution of Beverly Adams’ Lovey Kravezit , it’s still too brief ( to say nothing of secondary ) here ! The film also features an imposing henchman fitted with an iron plate over his bald head – appropriately dubbed " Metalhead " – who may or may not have inspired the " Jaws " character from a couple of much-later James Bond adventures ; the hovercraft chase ( starting at sea , continuing on dry land , and ending in a crowded street ) also anticipates the one from the 007 flick MOONRAKER ( 1979 ) . As for preposterous gadgets , here we get a gun programmed to delay shooting for a few seconds – so that , if it were to fall into enemy hands , the holder will invariably point the gun at himself ( believing it to be empty ) with fatal consequences ! Martin , of course , gets to sing as well – and there’s another jibe at Frank Sinatra ; however , a rather blatant goof went unnoticed by the film-makers : Martin and Ann-Margret flee a scene in the latter’s car ( with the top uncovered ) but , somewhere down the line , the vehicle turns into that usually driven by Martin ( complete with specially-fitted equipment to thwart the pursuers ) ! Once again , then , the final scene paves the way for the next entry in the series .
SECRET OF THE INCAS ( Jerry Hopper , 1954 )	Despite the intriguing title , this is a tedious potboiler with very little to commend it save the evocative Peruvian locations . A stiff , pre-stardom Charlton Heston is an arrogant opportunist whose dress code might well have inspired Indiana Jones but his adventures , unfortunately for the viewer , are nowhere near as exciting . Robert Young ( unconvinging as a belatedly introduced archaeologist ) , Thomas Mitchell ( as Heston's double-crossing partner ) and Michael Pate ( ridiculously decked out in a Rumpelstiltskin hat as the Inca High Priest or something ) are on hand to lend the film some much needed support but the female cast is very weak : Nicole Maurey tries too hard as the damsel-in-distress heroine , Glenda Farrell is wasted as an American tourist with an eye on Heston , and Peruvian singer Yma Sumac almost sinks the film with her embarrassing over-the-top chanting !
AIRPORT 1975 ( Jack Smight , 1974 )	The first of three official sequels to the blockbuster AIRPORT ( 1970 ) was already a big comedown from the original ; as a matter of fact , I almost gave this – not even being up to the level of SKYJACKED ( 1972 ) , a variant on the airborne disaster theme I’ve just watched ( despite employing the same lead , Charlton Heston ) but potentially even campier still ! That said , this type of old-fashioned entertainment has , with time , attained a certain cult status – which , however , shouldn’t exclude criticism because some of the people involved should have known better ! As ever with this type of film , an all-star cast has been assembled but , in their vast majority , these are given nothing of substance to do . Heston’s role is generally similar to the one he played in SKYJACKED ( having romantic issues with a stewardess , taking it upon himself to save the day in spite of the danger involved , etc . ) ; Karen Black is Heston’s love interest , who has to take control of a Boeing 747 when it collides in mid-air with a private plane and the whole cockpit crew is disabled . George Kennedy reprises his signature role of Joe Patroni ( which he would do one more time for the least of the series , THE CONCORDE . . . AIRPORT ’79 [ 1979 ] ) ; Susan Clark is his wife , who happens to be traveling on the Boeing with their son ! Efrem Zimbalist Jr . is the pilot blinded during the accident ; an ageing Dana Andrews is the ill-fated pilot of the second plane , and former B-movie starlet Beverly Garland his concerned spouse . Gloria Swanson turns up as herself , still playing at being a diva ! ; Myrna Loy – standing in for Helen Hayes’ Oscar-winning turn as a chronic stowaway in the original – plays an eccentric , alcoholic old lady ( perhaps as a nod to her signature role of Nora Charles in THE THIN MAN series ) ; Sid Caesar offers up mild comic relief as a cowardly passenger who admires Loy’s coolness in the face of crisis . Linda Blair – the sensation of THE EXORCIST ( 1973 ) – is still the sick child , here desperately in need of a kidney transplant , and Nancy Olson ( Swanson’s co-star / rival in SUNSET BOULEVARD [ 1950 ] ! ) her mother ; Helen Reddy , then , cheers up Blair’s spirits as a singing nun , while Martha Scott ( BEN-HUR [ 1959 ] ’s own mother – though she and Heston share no scenes ! ) is the latter’s disapproving Mother Superior , etc . I don’t know if it’s as a result of the terrific parody in AIRPLANE ! ( 1980 ) but I seemed to recall there being a lot more singing stuff here and , when the interest waned during the film’s earlier expository stages , I imagined Blair getting possessed all over again and telling Reddy what she could do with her guitar ! ! Anyway , once disaster hits , the film notches up reasonable suspense – culminating in the daring rescue mission ( a first attempt – where an air ace brought in especially for the job is killed – fails horribly ) . As I inferred before , the general tone of the film tends towards camp – what with Heston’s stoicism , Kennedy’s temperament ( at one point , forcibly throwing a dogged but insensitive TV reporter down the stairs of the control tower ! ) , Swanson’s self-aggrandizing monologues , Loy’s tipsy antics and Reddy’s saccharine contribution – so that the end result is undeniably fun but , at the same time , entirely predictable i . e . strictly formula stuff but done on a grand scale .
SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL ( Jean-Luc Godard , 1968 )	This " meeting " of two of the finest artists of the 20th Century - Jean-Luc Godard and The Rolling Stones - is truly a missed opportunity . The footage of the band recording their landmark song ( probably my favorite Stones track ) is certainly fascinating , as we watch the initially slow musical accompaniment for the song taking shape and metamorphose into the energetic , percussion-heavy final version we're familiar with . Sadly , it's also quite apparent here that Brian Jones ( who sits in his booth playing his acoustic guitar , rarely communicating with his bandmates except to ask for a cigarette and eventually disappearing altogether in the second half of the film ) was slipping away fast . Unfortunately for us viewers , Godard ( in full-blown " political activist " mode ) unwisely intersperses the recording sessions with lots of boring stuff featuring militant black people spouting " Black Power " philosophy in a junkyard , white political activists reading their " sacred " texts in a book shop while members of the general public are made to slap two of their comrades and give the Nazi salute and , most embarrassingly of all perhaps , Godard's current wife , Anne Wiazemsky ( playing Eve Democracy ! ) is seen being followed by a camera crew in a field and asked the most obtuse " topical " questions imaginable to which she merely answers in the affirmative or the negative ! As if this wasn't enough , the film has undoubtedly the murkiest soundtrack I've ever had the misfortune to hear ( so that I often had to rely on the forced Italian subtitles present on the VHS copy I was watching ) and I'd bet that even Robert Altman would have objected to Godard's occasional overlapping on the soundtrack of the Stones recording , the Black Power spoutings , an anonymous narrator reading a ( mercifully ) hilarious pulp novel , etc . For some inexplicable reason then , the film ends on a beach where an unidentified film crew is filming a battle sequence ! ! Godard's original intention was to not include the song " Sympathy For The Devil " in its entirety and when producer Ian Quarrier overruled him , he jumped up on London's National Film Theater stage following a screening of the film and knocked him out ! Godard's version , entitled ONE PLUS ONE , is also available on a double-feature R2 DVD including both cuts of the film but it's highly unlikely that I'll be bothering with it any time soon . . .
THE GIANT OF MARATHON ( Jacques Tourneur and , uncredited , Mario Bava , 1959 )	A momentous collaboration between two ( past and future ) masters of the horror genre which should perhaps have been made in that particular field , especially since the overall effect ( as with most Italian low-grade epics ) is somewhat juvenile - unlike either's best work - but also because there are no monsters involved ( unlike , say , THE GIANTS OF THESSALY [ 1960 ] ) ! Steve Reeves and Sergio Fantoni make for an above-average hero and villain ; Daniela Rocca fares a lot better here than she would do in COLOSSUS AND THE AMAZON QUEEN ( 1960 ) ; and Mylene Demongeot is one of the loveliest heroines in all peplums , evoking memories of the early Brigitte Bardot - who had herself appeared in a supporting role in HELEN OF TROY ( 1955 ) , one of many film versions centering around another legendary Greek battle ( among them THE Trojan HORSE [ 1961 ] , starring Reeves himself and which I watched later on in my peplum marathon ! ) . The slow-starting film ( which , thankfully , features no intrusive comic relief ) eventually picks up with the impressive battle sequence , which occupies about half its length ! Bava's camera-work is exemplary and his special effects are apparent in the over-the-top violence , particularly towards the end .
THREE ( James Salter , 1969 )	I became aware of this one fairly recently via a thread on the " Criterion Forum " , where several people were asking about it ; I happened to recollect that the film was turning up regularly on Cable TV and , so , made it a point to check it out the next time it was on ! Well , it emerges as nothing really special : a ménage-a'-trois romance on the lines of JULES AND JIM ( 1962 ) , filmed in a fragmentary but not unattractive style . The script makes the occasional perceptive comment about its central theme ( especially through the contribution of Sam Waterston as the shy prospective lawyer ) but , given that the three friends / lovers agree on the fickle nature of the relationship beforehand , the romantic element isn’t particularly stressed – so that there’s little character growth and , consequently , none of the potential jealousy and heartache inherent in such a situation ! Frankly , the film is more valuable as a travelogue : the narrative ( based on a story by Irwin Shaw ! ) denotes the adventures of a couple of vacationing American students in Europe – with Florence ( Italy’s art mecca ) , provincial France and Spain for backdrops – falling under the spell of a sophisticated but free-spirited girl of British and French descent ( played by Charlotte Rampling ) . Along the way , however , the two boys meet and hitch up with a number of other girls – one of these is Gillian Hills , whom I recently watched perform the notorious-but-now-very-mild nude scenes in Michelangelo Antonioni’s BLOWUP ( 1966 ) ; the film also boasts a pleasant score by Laurence Rosenthal . Apparently , James Salter ( whose only directorial effort this proved to be ) is a highly respected author but I’d never heard of him personally ; looking at his filmography on the IMDb , I notice that I’d already watched a film he scripted – Sidney Lumet’s THE APPOINTMENT ( 1969 ) – and I’ve got another one in my " To Watch " pile ( recorded off Italian TV ) that was based on a novel he wrote – the aviation drama THE HUNTERS ( 1958 ) , starring Robert Mitchum !
The Phantom Of The Opera ( 1962 )	A relatively lush , if ultimately modest , version by Hammer of the venerable classic which , to me , seems unjustly maligned by fans as it certainly offers consistent entertainment value throughout and an effective shock moment or two typical of director Terence Fisher . Herbert Lom makes for a fine tragic figure ( virtually reprised a decade later for AIP's MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE [ 1971 ] ) and Michael Gough provides delicious villainy as always . The leads are a matter of taste , particularly Heather Sears , but the film's handsome production design is the film's real star anyway ; as for the operatic sequences , they are sufficiently baroque to avoid being an intrusion to the unfolding drama ( as was definitely the case with the 1943 Universal version ) . I also wasn't bothered by the liberties taken with the plot line and , in fact , quite liked the ending with the hero aiding in the Phantom's ' cause ' and the latter's final sacrifice ; here , too , the Phantom eschews the overt romanticism of earlier ( and later ) versions by only wanting to turn Christine into a great star rather than falling for her and try to compete with her true love .
SERGEANTS 3 ( John Sturges , 1962 )	Ever since my childhood , the Rat Pack films have been staples on Italian TV – but , curiously enough , not this one ! ; still , as often happens , its long absence doesn’t necessarily make it a lost gem and , actually , it can now be seen as the least of them ! In any case , a legitimate DVD edition of it has just been released in time for the 10th anniversary of Frank Sinatra’s passing – though I had to make do myself with a barely adequate VHS-to-DVD dub for this viewing . . . but which , surprisingly ran for 117 minutes when the film’s official length is given as 112 ! Anyway , personally produced by Sinatra , this emerges as the third version of a Rudyard Kipling story : a sort of GUNGA DIN ( 1939 ) parody in Western garb – except that the original already contained strong doses of humor ! Old hand W . R . Burnett wrote the script and the necessity here to follow a proper plot renders this less freewheeling than other Rat Peck outings ; however , this then results in jarring bouts of violence played alongside revue-style comic sketches ! The film’s major set-piece is an extended shootout between the boys and some renegade Indians in a ghost town which culminates in an outburst of fireworks and the shooting of dynamite a ' la RIO BRAVO ( 1959 ) ; by the way , Sinatra and Dean Martin had already proved themselves in the genre – most notably with JOHNNY CONCHO ( 1956 ) and RIO BRAVO itself respectively ( Martin actually became a staple of the gun-and-saddle tradition between 1956 and 1973 ) . With this in mind , the repartee among the stars is par for the course : Martin has the old Cary Grant role , Peter Lawford fills in for Douglas Fairbanks Jr . and Sammy Davis Jr . , naturally , is Din ; as for Joey Bishop’s character , he usually finds himself the brunt of the boys’ jokes . Sinatra himself seems constrained by the martinet role played in GUNGA DIN by Victor McLaglen but , typically , Dino and Davis have fun with their roles . Michael Pate and Henry Silva ( as father and son ) feature as the rebelling Indians ; incidentally , Sinatra and Silva’s next confrontation – later that year in THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE – proved far more memorable . It’s also worth pointing out that three of Bing Crosby’s sons appear here as bumbling privates . Director Sturges was himself a Western expert and had already collaborated with Sinatra on the war adventure NEVER SO FEW ( 1959 ) ; he also did a number of Cavalry vs . Indians-type efforts such as ESCAPE FROM FORT BRAVO ( 1953 ) and THE HALLELUJAH TRAIL ( 1965 ; which was also largely played for laughs ) . P . S . Shortly after this film’s release , Sinatra fell out badly with Lawford ( even throwing him down a flight of stairs ! ) after President Kennedy – who was Lawford’s brother-in-law – choose to stay over at Bing Crosby’s house rather than his ( due to recent allegations of Sinatra’s connection with the Mafia being uncovered ) and which explains Lawford’s disappearance from subsequent Rat Pack efforts . . .
Fritz Lang's Indian Epic	I was wary of purchasing Fantoma's 2-Disc Set of " Fritz Lang's Indian Epic " after being somewhat let down by the 1921 Silent original ( co-scripted by Lang himself ) and also its less-than-stellar reputation . For this reason , when the second part of the saga turned up on Italian TV a couple of years ago , I decided to check it out just the same so as to get an inkling of what to expect ! I recall thinking it pretty kitschy and unworthy of Lang's enormous talent , but Fantoma's sale ( through their website ) of their entire DVD catalog a few months back made it an irresistible acquisition ! Well , having now watched the entire saga ( with dialogue and in color , as opposed to the rather static Silent version directed by Joe May - although hearing the Indian-garbed characters talking in German took some getting used to ) , I was pleasantly surprised by how genuinely engaging and sheerly enjoyable it all was ! Though it was sold as an epic production ( to the point of concluding ESCHNAPUR with the promise that Part II would feature greater thrills and even more spectacle ) at a time when such films were all the rage , the saga was actually a pretty modest undertaking by eclectic ( and prolific ) German producer Artur Brauner . Despite the two films ' exotic , handsome look ( not least in the provocative dances of Debra Paget ) , the budgetary constraints were painfully obvious in the special effects department , especially the hilarious appearance of a ' ropey ' cobra which is intended to ' test ' ( the scantily-clad ) Miss Paget's faithfulness to the Maharajah ! ! All in all , even if these films hardly constitute Lang's greatest work ( though he harbored an evident affection throughout his life for this particular tale , which was originally conceived by his former wife Thea von Harbou ) , they have great - and enduring - appeal for aficionados of old-fashioned , serial-like adventure stories tinged with romance and mysticism . Even so , while I don't subscribe to that school of thought myself , there are some film critics ( Tom Gunning , Jean Douchet and Pierre Rissient among them ) who think very highly of Lang's Indian diptych - the first considering it one of Lang's towering achievements and the last two numbering it among the ten greatest films of all time ! !
THE FAR HORIZONS ( Rudolph Mate ' , 1955 )	A crucial event in American history is rendered dull and unexciting by Hollywood convention ; the story of the Lewis and Clark expedition which in the early 1800s conquered unclaimed territory for the ever-growing United States . Production values are glossy and there are a few action highlights , but the handling is uninspired and the slowly-paced film emerges an undistinguished effort overall . Casting is variable : Fred MacMurray makes for a staid Lewis but Charlton Heston's Clark is , as ever , at home in such larger-than-life surroundings ; Donna Reed ( as an Indian squaw ! ) and Barbara Hale provide the none-too-convincing romantic interest - which actually takes up a good deal of the running-time ( before the expedition , both men love Hale but she prefers Heston ; when the latter meets up with Reed , they fall for each other - but complications of the boring variety arise when it's revealed that she's been promised by the tribe which has abducted her to a villainous French trapper / guide and , even when she finally escapes and goes back to her people , she's spoken for by a rash young Indian brave ! ) . This allows Heston to engage in fisticuffs and he even falls out with MacMurray , but the audience's interest is never more than dimly aroused ; however , veteran William Demarest is on hand as a level-headed sergeant who actually keeps the company together during such trying times . Anyway , the film is watchable enough in itself - though it's better approached , perhaps , as a Western rather than a widescreen spectacular ( with which Heston would soon come to be identified ) . . . and , in any case , it's miles behind such celebrated ' epics ' of American colonialism as John Ford's DRUMS ALONG THE MOHAWK ( 1939 ) and King Vidor's NORTHWEST PASSAGE ( 1940 ) .
BURY ME DEAD ( Bernard Vorhaus , 1947 ) ; DEATH BY PROXY	Little-known Poverty Row noir which is fairly complex and interesting , but unbalanced by its humor . The best things about it are the cinematography ( courtesy of the legendary John Alton ) and the participation of the two female leads : June Lockhart ( her role is not too dissimilar from that of SHE-WOLF OF London [ 1946 ] ? she was on the point of being driven mad in the latter film , while here she's the object of murder , and the reason for both is her inheritance ) and Cathy O'Donnell ( actually top-billed but her role is subsidiary to Lockhart's ? from what little I've read about it , her character has been played up as a femme fatale but she's really just a mixed-up kid , recalling the Martha Vickers of THE BIG SLEEP [ 1946 ] ) . Having mentioned THE BIG SLEEP , Sonia Darrin ( who played the sharp-tongued bookstore clerk with whom private detective Elisha Cook Jr . was enamored ) appears in BURY ME DEAD as an ill-fated schemer . On the other hand , the male lead ( Hugh Beaumont ) is pretty bland ? despite being deceived , beaten up and accused of murder , he keeps an incongruous jovial countenance throughout ! Nonetheless , the suspense sequences towards the end are moderately well-handled ( though the patronizing , thick-headed police inspector character is decidedly overbearing ) . With regards to the renamed TV version , it runs a mere 27 minutes against the original 68 : whole subplots are omitted , as well as most of the flashback sequences ; consequently , it makes little sense ? and , really , is only worth watching once for the sake of curiosity . Unfortunately , the print on the VCI DVD left a lot to be desired ( the company's output over the years , while undeniably earnest , has also been alarmingly sloppy ! ) : the audio was especially problematic with the presence of excessive pops and crackles ( ironically , these didn't plague the Condensed Version as much ) and , most bafflingly , a complete audio drop-out for a few seconds of dialogue ! !
THE FROGMEN ( Lloyd Bacon , 1951 )	As would be the case with DESTINATION GOBI ( 1953 ) , which I’ve just watched , this unusual war film about a specialized outfit also happens to be a starring vehicle for Richard Widmark ( and , similarly , featured no prominent female roles ) . Fox were noted for the documentary-style approach to their films for the first few years of the post-war era ; this was a typical example , mixing realistic detail ( while the underwater photography in itself is well done , the film tends to drag during these sequences ) with a number of established Hollywood conventions . Widmark begins by rubbing his men the wrong way because of their devotion to his predecessor , with Dana Andrews as his chief antagonist ( especially after the former opts to leave the latter behind during a reconnaissance operation ) . At one point , however , Andrews has to take over a mission when Widmark becomes indisposed ( where the former’s lack of responsibility leads to serious injuries sustained by one of the men ) ; eventually , the two acquire a mutual respect – which occurs when a torpedo fired at the ship by the enemy fails to explode and has to be delicately dismantled . The latter sequence is one of four suspense / action set-pieces in the film : the others being the two underwater missions themselves and the trial run for the first operation mentioned above . The supporting cast is led by Gary Merrill ( acting as , more or less , the voice of conscience ) and Jeffrey Hunter ( as a brash young member of the team ) ; also appearing , in unbilled roles , are subsequent favorite character actors James Gregory and Jack Warden .
TWO EVIL EYES ( George A . Romero and Dario Argento , 1990 )	This two-part film was a project initiated by Argento , who invited Romero to make an anthology together in which each would direct his favorite story from the celebrated horror author's work . Incidentally , the fact that both these stories had already been incorporated into Roger Corman's own Poe compendium , TALES OF TERROR ( 1962 ) , renders this a semi-remake of that film ! The resulting mélange is tolerable but rather unsatisfying as a whole ? it must be said , however , that both directors ' careers had already started slacking by this point . Romero's decision to adapt " The Facts In The Case Of Mr . Valdemar " reveals perhaps why he feels such a strong affinity with the zombie subgenre ; still , the results here are pedestrian and curiously uninvolving ? though the zombie moans are decidedly creepy . The cast includes Adrienne Barbeau ( ex-wife of John Carpenter , a contemporaneous genre exponent ) and E . G . Marshall ( who , memorably , had played an insect-hating businessman in a previous anthology Romero had directed by himself ? CREEPSHOW [ 1982 ] ) . Even if it's an image of the undead Mr . Valdemar which made this film's poster , Argento's segment ? yet another adaptation of " The Black Cat " ? is actually more highly regarded ; still , despite boasting some of the director's trademark visual flair , the segment is generally heavy-handed and overlong . Harvey Keitel brings his method training to the characteristically expressionist Poe landscape ; this clash of styles lends the proceedings a welcome air of black comedy ? especially in the star's openly hostile relationship with the ill-fated titular creature . It also provides irrelevant inserts of gory detail since Keitel is a crime-scene photographer named Rod Usher ( Argento must have had his Poe stories mixed-up at this point ! ) where the murder victims , appropriately enough , have expired in the sadistic fashion typical of the author's work ? including an unlikely and cumbersome pendulum device . There's a nightmare sequence , too , in which Keitel finds himself in medieval times and suffers an excruciating death lifted from the notorious CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST ( 1979 ) ? and , needless to say , we're treated here to the usual cat - meowing - revealing - a - body - hidden - behind - the - wall ending ! Martin Balsam appears as an elderly nosy neighbor of Keitel's , but his contribution doesn't amount to much . Pino Donaggio's score is most effective during the closing credits sequence ; responsible for the gruesome effects in both segments is Tom Savini , a Romero regular ( with the half-putrefied kitten at the end being a particularly inspired creation ) .
MAROONED ( John Sturges , 1969 )	Amazingly , this was begun by none other than Frank Capra but the Hollywood veteran – who would subsequently make no more films – was replaced when his requested budget could not be met by Columbia ( though the services of his son as Associate Producer were somehow retained ) ; however , the studio then seemed more acquiescent when John Sturges came on board – given that the picture ended up exceeding the initially proposed budget by some $5 million ! Actually , Sturges had just come from another epic where the protagonists spend much of the time in a cramped environment , i . e . the submarine in ICE STATION ZEBRA ( 1968 ) ; this one , being based on real events and revolving around the novel space program rather than the tired Cold War formula of the Alistair MacLean adventure thriller , was a more significant undertaking – but the end result is nowhere near as entertaining ! The film is both solemn and cold : as expected , it’s meticulously detailed – down to the irritating over-use of up-to-date jargon such as ‘So-and-so systems Are Go’ , ‘Roger’ , ‘Wilco’ , etc . Incidentally , while the presence of an all-star cast may have boosted its box-office potential ( for the record MAROONED came hot on the heels of Stanley Kubrick’s even more bewildering but , ultimately , far more entrancing 2001 : A SPACE ODYSSEY [ 1968 ] ) , it distracts from the unfolding drama : Gregory Peck’s constricted role of the seasoned but stoic overseer would become a staple of 1970s disaster epics – here , he’s the head of the program who has to decide what to do when a shuttle’s re-entry fire malfunctions and the three-man astronaut crew is stranded in space ( MAROONED can then be seen as the APOLLO 13 [ 1995 ] of its day , though the particular mission that film depicts would only occur in 1970 ! ) . An ex-colleague of theirs now employed in the Control Room ( David Janssen ) is the only one who believes that a rescue mission is possible in the restricted time-frame before the oxygen supply runs out ; in fact , Peck has to be prodded by the U . S . President himself to take the challenge during a fairly risible sequence in which , distraught by the precarious situation he’s facing , Peck’s also pulled over on a highway by a couple of cops for over-speeding – even so , this remote chance is almost lost when the launch site is beset by a hurricane ! The astronauts are well enough played by Richard Crenna , a hysterical Gene Hackman and James Franciscus – all of whom have wives and kids back home anxiously awaiting the resolution of their fate ; when they’re given the chance to talk to them towards the end , the conversations are predictably awkward and touching . In fact , this latter section is the one that generates the most interest and suspense – especially when a Russian spacecraft turns up during the delicate transfer of two of the men ( one has opted to sacrifice himself for the sake of the others ) to the rescue vessel . Unfortunately , one of the film’s trump cards back in 1969 – its Oscar-winning special effects – haven’t worn well the passage of time , being exposed by the extra clarity of the DVD transfer ; however , this takes nothing away from the splendid cinematography by Sturges regular Daniel Fapp . One final thing : while the movie’s official length is given as 134 minutes , the version I watched ran for only 124 ( in PAL mode ) ; taking into consideration the different frame-rate when played in NTSC , it would still leave about five minutes unaccounted for – which I take to be an " Intermission " card , or some such addendum during its theatrical run , which wasn’t included here .
THE CIMARRON KID ( Budd Boetticher , 1952 )	This emerges as a pretty good example of the typical Audie Murphy Western vehicle ? though of lesser quality to the only one I had previously watched , NO NAME ON THE BULLET ( 1959 ) and , being Budd Boetticher's first Western , clearly a minor effort in his canon . Many films of this era treated ( in a heavily romanticized manner ) the exploits of famous outlaws of the Old West : Murphy appears as Bill Doolin and , at one point , he is told by the leader of The Dalton Gang that " They'll be writing ballads about us " and , sure enough , their exploits were later immortalized in music by the Country Rock band Eagles in " Doolin-Dalton " , a song off of their second album " Desperado " ( 1973 ) . Typically , Murphy is seen forced into a life of crime by circumstances or , more precisely , the persecution of a law-enforcement officer ( while another , played by Leif Erickson , is more sympathetic to his plight ) . As ever , the gang is an eclectic assortment of characters : affable Noah Beery Jr . is their leader , Hugh O'Brian the red-headed hot-tempered challenger , James Best the ladies ' man , Frank Silvera the half-breed , etc . ; interestingly , we get a couple of romances going on ( Murphy with the daughter of a man who shelters them and Best with a fiery Mexican girl ) and the female characters are surprisingly strong for this type of film . Reassembling themselves in the wake of a bank hold-up gone awry ( the film's best action sequence , climaxing in Beery's memorable come-uppance with the spilling coins a graphic substitution for blood ) , the gang is subsequently betrayed by the ' inside man ' in a train robbery they try to pull off . Murphy is eventually persuaded to give himself up , with Erickson promising him a fair trial this time around . Shot in pleasant Technicolor , the generically-titled THE CIMARRON KID serves up compact , pacy and unpretentious entertainment ? perfect viewing after a hard day's work .
DISPERATAMENTE L'ESTATE SCORSA ( Silvio Amadio , 1970 )	Having recently watched Amadio's lesbian drama ISLAND OF THE SWEDES ( 1969 ) , I checked out another of his films but , alas , it turned out not to be erotic at all ( he also made the giallo AMUCK ! [ 1972 ] with Euro-Cult starlets Barbara Bouchet and Rosalba Neri , and which I may get to fairly soon ) . Still , I found this to be fairly engaging for what it is : the budding romance on a remote island between young Italian widow Paola Pitagora ( accompanied by her son ) and mysterious foreigner Nino Segurini takes a hazardous turn when a couple of sinister-looking men arrive on the scene and it becomes apparent that they've come for Segurini and won't take no for an answer ! The first half is pretty slow and rather uneventful as we're shown in flashback how the couple first met ( they happen to be neighbors ) , the man's friendship with the woman's inquisitive offspring ( who comes to consider the former as a surrogate father and calls him " Uncle " ) and also her slow realization that , in spite of how little she knows about his past , she has fallen in love with him . Eventually , it transpires that Segurini had fled East Germany in possession of a state secret ( for which his sister had already given her life ) ; this we see in another ( rather quaint ) flashback which is presented in monochrome . The latter stages of the film generate some measure of suspense as Segurini attempts to elude his dogged pursuers - with Pitagora and son in between ; in fact , he only gives himself up when they threaten the boy . The woman , however , doesn't stay put and , in a scene which might well have been inspired by a similar one in POINT BLANK ( 1967 ) , she bumps her car repeatedly into that of the Germans just as they're about to board the ship that will take them ( and her lover ) off the island for good . Still , Segurini flees once again and even fakes his own death - but decides to keep away from his loved ones so as not to endanger their lives any longer ! Not a bad film overall , therefore , but it's also true that its raisons d'etre are Pitagora's excellent performance ( I haven't seen her in that many films - but , hopefully , should be adding REVOLVER [ 1973 ] to these fairly soon - recalling above all her turns as a member of the dysfunctional family in FISTS IN THE POCKET [ 1965 ] and as the quietly seductive murderess of SENZA SAPERE NIENTE DI LEI [ 1969 ] ) and an equally fine score by the ever-reliable Riz Ortolani . By the way , the film's long title translates to DESPERATELY LAST SUMMER ; curiously , I couldn't determine whether this was ever released outside Italy - and yet , other than the title itself , all the credits on the print I watched were in English . . . ! !
Those Daring Young Men In Their Jaunty Jalopies ( Ken Annakin , 1969 )	The U . S . theatrical release of this follow-up to the highly popular epic comedy THOSE MAGNIFICENT MEN IN THEIR FLYING MACHINES ( 1965 ) was decidedly ill-timed ? coming as it did just three days after that of MIDNIGHT COWBOY ! ? and must have made an already inferior product ( in comparison to the original ) seem quaint and redundant . Perhaps this even explains the film's hacking down to 93 minutes ( from an original length of 125 ! ) over there , not to mention its sheer invisibility on TV and home video ( in my neck of the woods at least ) until now , via Legend Films ' no-frills but full-length DVD ? albeit under its more recognizable alternate title rather than the original one of MONTE CARLO OR BUST ! Perhaps inevitably , several of the same cast and crew from the predecessor are involved here as well : producer-director-co-writer Annakin , screenwriter Jack Davies , composer Ron Goodwin , actors Terry-Thomas ( in a way , actually reprising his signature role by playing the son of the character he had portrayed in FLYING MACHINES ) , Eric Sykes ( again as the latter's valet ) and Gert Frobe ( as , obviously , the German representative ) , etc . Also like its prototype , several international stars were roped in to fill out the roles of the other contestants : from the USA , Tony Curtis ( who , sadly , is a long way from his winsome characterization in THE GREAT RACE [ 1965 ] ) ; from Britain , Peter Cook , Dudley Moore ( amusing as , respectively , an Army Major-cum-amateur inventor and his sidekick ) and , later , Susan Hampshire ( who initially tries to detour Curtis but eventually joins him ) ; from Italy , a level-headed Walter Chiari and a typically hot-blooded Lando Buzzanca ; from France , a group of three girls ( played by Mireille Darc , Marie Dubois and Nicoletta Macchiavelli ) who , prior to the start of the race , have a run-in with their compatriot organizer of the Monte Carlo Rally , Bourvil . There are other stars or recognizable faces making guest appearances for no real reason except to add to the fun ( and expense ) : Jack Hawkins and Derren Nesbitt ( as jewel thieves that have hid their booty inside one of Frobe's spare tyres ! ) , Hattie Jacques ( as an emancipated lady journalist ) , Richard Wattis and , according to the IMDb , even Paul Muller ( but I didn't recognize him ) . In this talented company and with the lavish budget accorded , there can't fail to be enjoyable stretches ( particularly with every new contraption Cook and Moore come up with after the last one had unsurprisingly failed ) and other sundry compensations ( not least Jimmy Durante's grizzled intonation of the title song and the accompanying animated credits sequence ) ; however , as I said earlier , the film is not up to the levels of inspiration that permeated its memorable predecessor . Tony Curtis only had one or two major films left before slipping into TV roles and the occasional big-screen cameo , while Annakin wouldn't really be allowed to handle another such stellar cast before a decade's time had elapsed ? including the umpteenth cinematic version of " The Man In The Iron Mask " in THE FIFTH MUSKETEER ( 1979 ) .
CHUCK AMUCK : THE MOVIE ( TV ) ( John Needham , 1989 )	Ostensibly a documentary about legendary animator Chuck Jones ( made for British TV at the time of the opening of the Museum Of The Moving Image - which I visited in 1999 , when it was about to be closed down ! ) , the film is something of a mixed bag as , despite the title , it isn't really an exhaustive biography of the man but a generic documentary about the art of animation . Having said that , his explanations into the design of the various classic cartoon characters was undeniably illuminating but it deals only intermittently with his career and his numerous collaborators - spending too much time on childhood recollections and an over-extended introductory sequence , which serves as an advert to the Museum more than anything else ! - though we do get to see some shining samples from his celebrated work for the Warner Bros . studio during their 1940s and 1950s heyday ( mainly from DUCK AMUCK [ 1953 ] , appropriately enough ) . Therefore there is , perhaps unsurprisingly , no mention of Jones ' rather disastrous move to MGM in the next decade - where he was involved with the substandard latter-day Tom & Jerry cartoons ( though he also contrived to make THE PHANTOM TOLLBOOTH [ 1970 ] , a quite good intellectual animated feature in the vein of " Alice In Wonderland " and " The Wizard Of Oz " ) .
THE LAST PISTOLERO ( Alessandro Dominici , 2002 )	Franco Nero is a gunslinger , per the film's title the last of his breed ; he goes to an abandoned warehouse - the setting , presumably , is the present - and commits ritual suicide . An 8-minute short that's clearly an ode to the Spaghetti Western subgenre ( though shot in black-and-white ) and featuring one of its more durable stars . Even if very little actually happens - and , rather than utilizing music from Nero's own Westerns , the soundtrack draws on the instantly-recognizable scores composed by maestro Ennio Morricone for the Clint Eastwood / Sergio Leone films - it manages , in its limited duration , to be oddly elegiac and , indeed , is quite nicely done in every department .
THE FROZEN DEAD ( Herbert J . Leder , 1966 )	The creator of IT ! ( 1966 ) also made this preposterous but slightly more enjoyable precursor to the " Nazi Zombie " sub-genre earlier that same year and , funnily enough , I came across both these hitherto rare movies almost simultaneously from different sources ? which is why I ended up watching them back-to-back . Actually , THE FROZEN DEAD had previously been available on a low budget DVD double-feature with the similar ( but clearly crazier ) THEY SAVED HITLER'S BRAIN ( 1963 ) that soon went out-of-print ? so I am certainly glad to have stumbled upon the former via alternative channels that , curiously ( since I have no recollection of it ever being shown on Italian TV in the past 25 years ) , sports a second audio track in Italian ( which , ironically , is much cleaner than the garbled original ) ! ! Anyway , THE FROZEN DEAD stars waning Hollywood star Dana Andrews ( sporting an inadvertently amusing German accent that , together with his silent ' r ' pronounciation , makes him sound as if he is slurring his lines ? and , being aware of his past battles with alcohol , I wonder ! ) as a former Nazi scientist who has , since the end of WWII , relocated to a large estate in the English countryside to conduct revivification experiments on 12 cryogenically frozen top Nazi officials ( including his own brother Edward Fox ) ! In fact , the latter's anguished cries open the film as 8 of these subjects are shown to have failed in regaining their normal mental capacities and , consequently , are treated much like unwanted pets , taken out for their daily stroll by Andrews ' whip-wielding assistant Karl ( Alan Tilvern ) . Karl's own zeal and blind faith in the Party has made him ( unwisely , as it turns out ) invite his impatient superiors to witness Andrews ' non-existent breakthrough with his first ' success ' : a hulking , bald manservant named Joseph . To complicate matters further , 3 innocent bystanders ( Andrews ' niece , her ill-fated best friend , and Andrews ' younger colleague ) soon take up residence in Andrews ' mansion , obviously unaware of the sinister goings-on beneath in his secret laboratory or his past political affiliations . Ever eager-to-please , Karl impulsively injects the visiting friend with a mortal substance ? and has Fox strangle her for good measure ! ? so as to provide the disillusioned Andrews with a live brain specimen for him to study ( in an attempt not to muck up any more of the remaining frozen dead ) ! A complex charade ? that also involves Karl's facially-scarred secret female relative who lives nearby ? is set in motion to appease Andrews ' niece from worrying for ( or delving deeper into ) her friend's sudden disappearance ? but this does not stop the niece from finding out about the former within hours ! The young scientist ? who , naturally , has fallen for the niece on first sight ? is in on the friend's murder ( since he was brought here specifically to help Andrews successfully complete his experiments ) but only decides to do something about it following a couple of failed murder attempts ( courtesy of the increasingly demented Karl ) on the niece's person ! Ever the dedicated sadists , the 2 Nazi superiors ( who seemingly appear and disappear at the mansion at random ) torture Karl for his clumsiness and force Andrews to throw him in with the frozen dead for the ultimate punishment ! The last ( and most outlandish ) pieces of the jigsaw puzzle to be found in this lurid shocker are ' the living head ' ? belonging to the niece's friend , of course , within which resides the all-important live brain ? although Andrews is never shown doing much with it ? apparently dreading her scowling countenance ! ? and the remarkably Cocteauesque wall of severed arms ? whose real use is never fully explained ( unless some of the frozen dead had been maimed or something ) but their potential is certainly not wasted when , in the film's climax , the head telepathically ( don't ask ) fatally wraps them around the necks of Andrews and the older of the Nazi superiors ( Karel Stepanek ) ! The very last shot of the film , then , has the head pleading with the surviving niece and her doctor companion to give it that much-denied burial ! 2 final things : director Leder must have seen the works of horror maestro Tod Browning one time too many because , both here and and IT ! , he displays the latter's frustrating knack of cutting away at the most inopportune moments and having much of the key action take place offscreen ! ; besides , while the version I acquired came from an open-matte color print ( making the boom mike clearly visible a couple of times ! ) , the film was apparently originally released to theaters in black-and-white ? which , I suppose , must have robbed the living head of her creepy bluish pallor !
THE GUMBALL RALLY ( Chuck Bail , 1976 )	Car chases were the centerpiece of several popular and well-made thrillers-cum-road movies of the early 1970s ? chief among them VANISHING POINT ( 1971 ) , DIRTY MARY CRAZY LARRY and THE SUGARLAND EXPRESS ( both 1974 ) . THE GUMBALL RALLY , however , decided to up the ante by having several cars involved in an illegal cross-country race ( as did the contemporaneous CANNONBALL [ 1976 ] , which I watched on Italian TV as a kid and might revisit soon ) ? but , while the latter had a satirical tone to it , this is straightforward , light-hearted fare ( the star-studded THE CANNONBALL RUN [ 1981 ] , then , was an even broader variation ) . That GUMBALL has not acquired the cult reputation of the others may have something to do with the fact that many of the characters here are stereotypes : bored young businessman Michael Sarrazin ( who masterminds the covert event ) , Italian Raul Julia ( his prowess behind the wheel being continually sidetracked by his Latin Lover ways ! ) , yokel Gary Busey , a couple of tipsy old English gentlemen , the obligatory girl drivers , the ethnic hopeful with his reluctant but star-struck girlfriend in tow , and even a wild-eyed eccentric motorcyclist who invariably gets into various scrapes throughout ( however , even more flustered than he is the seasoned cop on the racers ' tail ) . Needless to say , the real stars of the film are the stunt people who relentlessly engage in gratuitous ( albeit meticulously-choreographed ) mayhem ; these scenes ? along with the comically deceptive aspect of the race vis-a'-vis the law ( though it is rarely laugh-out-loud funny ) ? make the whole worth viewing once ? since the rest is thin , over-familiar and even kind of dreary ! ; thankfully , Dominic Frontiere's bouncy score makes everything that little bit more palatable .
THE UNDYING MONSTER ( John Brahm , 1942 )	Along with MAN MADE MONSTER ( 1941 ; also very recently released on DVD ) , this has been my most-wanted horror film of the 1940s for many years ; previously , I only had a huge still of John Howard in full werewolf make-up found in one of my father's film books to whet my appetite ! I was aware that this film is not generally considered to be in the same league as Universal's THE WOLF MAN ( 1941 ) ? with which it was originally intended to compete ? and , in hindsight , I certainly concur with that opinion ? which is a pity because this is a much-better directed film : witness that stunning , long tracking shot at the very beginning with the camera prowling through the Hammond mansion or the first attack seen , via jerky camera movement , from the werewolf's POV ( subsequently much copied not least in the definitive werewolf movie , John Landis ' AN American WEREWOLF IN London [ 1981 ] ) . The cast is quite decent ( if still unspectacular when compared to the star-studded line-up roped in for THE WOLF MAN ! ) : James Ellison ? later of I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE ( 1943 ) ? as the bemused detective hero , John Howard as the troubled current head of the Hammond family , Bramwell Fletcher ? best-known for going mad after witnessing THE MUMMY ( 1932 ) ' s " little walk " and who gives the best performance in this film ? as the mysterious Hammond family doctor , Halliwell Hobbes as the Hammonds ' superstitious butler , Aubrey Mather as Ellison's boss and an uncredited Charles McGraw as the Hammonds ' gamekeeper . The female cast is much less impressive , and Ellison's ditzy partner is a particular liability ! On the other hand , Lucien Ballard's atmospheric black-and-white cinematography is the film's best quality . The werewolf make-up is not bad in itself but , again , falls rather short of Jack Pierce's famous Larry Talbot look ; the script even copies THE WOLF MAN's legendary ditty but in this version , it is a distinctly lame one ! Disappointingly , though , the monster only really comes to prominence in the last ten minutes of the film and is far from being immortal like the title says : in fact , it is briskly dealt with by a couple of close range gunshots from the unusually efficient police force ! The fact that the curse of lycanthropy is passed on from one generation to another not through a bite but rather as punishment for an ancestor of Howard's having sold his soul to the devil is ingenious ? but the potential of this interesting subplot is hampered by the film's own briefness and , consequently , is never treated in any significant way ; similarly , Fletcher's budding romance with Howard's sister is intimated very early on and that's it ? making these people somewhat less than three-dimensional characters .
GRINDHOUSE ( Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino , 2007 )	Yesterday's whining about missing out on these discussions proved premature , because I eventually managed to get hold of a DivX copy of the film in a matter of hours ! It may not be the ideal medium to fully appreciate the GRINDHOUSE experience ? especially in view of the cropped picture and muffled audio ? but , for the moment , it was enough to tide me over ; at least , I was able to get an inkling of what the film is like since , as I said before , there's no announced local release date as yet . Anyway , I have to say that on the whole I was underwhelmed by it all : like Joe Karlosi , individually I'd rate the Rodriguez segment and Tarantino's . Still , I'm sure it's better to watch them as a double-feature because neither of the two parts really add up to much on their own . After all , that is the whole nostalgic spirit of grindhouse it is trying to celebrate complete with cheesy trailers , two 90 minute B-movies back-to-back , scratched prints , audio drop-outs , missing reels , etc . I have only watched a handful of grindhouse movies myself ? 4 of which were introduced by Tarantino himself ( together with Joe Dante ) during a marathon midnight screening at the 2004 Venice Film Festival . To get to the film ( s ) proper now : I've watched little of Robert Rodriguez's movies so far and I wasn't that much taken by them and his " Planet Terror " is an extremely gory zombie flick which , as mindlessly enjoyable as it is while it's on , essentially brings nothing new to the table . It's as much a virtual retread of his own FROM DUSK TILL DAWN ( 1996 ) as a nod to the zombie films of George Romero , Lucio Fulci et al . The cast is a mix of young actors and grindhouse / action-movie veterans : Rose McGowan is ideally cast as the heroine who finds inspired use for her leg when it's amputated after being bitten off and Marley Shelton leaves a good impression as a harassed needle-sporting doctor ? but then Freddy Rodriguez is a non-entity as McGowan's ex-boyfriend ; the rest include Josh Brolin as Shelton's crazed surgeon husband , Tom Savini as a distraught cop , Michael Biehn as his superior , Jeff Fahey as a bartender , Michael Parks ( reprising his sheriff role from the KILL BILL [ ] films ! ) , Bruce Willis as a shady military official and Tarantino himself ( who keeps inflicting his imaginary thespian skills on moviegoers despite the resulting sabotage of his appearances ) as an obnoxious orderly of Willis ' ? so his stomach-turning demise was particularly welcome ! Quentin " Look , I'm an artist , alright " Tarantino's " Death Proof " is potentially intriguing : while Rodriguez's aim seems to have been to merely replicate the dumb thrills of typical grindhouse efforts , Tarantino's segment ? frustrating though it is ? comes off more like a reflection on this particular style of film-making ( and the road movie / car chase variety in particular ) , with little plot and a lot of mood-setting . But , unfortunately , Tarantino is too much in love with his own dialogue and there are reams of utterly uninteresting chick chatter between the two sets of girls which makes for a rather dull ride ( no pun intended ) and I pretty much gave up on listening to the actual banter after vainly trying to sort out any substance from all the expletives ! Some of the girls ( Vanessa Ferlito and Sydney Tamiia Poitier ) look good , thankfully , but I have to ask what they were doing mouthing off would-be hip references to cult ' car ' films of the 1970s or wondering what turn Pete Townshend's career would have taken had he left The Who ? ! All of which makes Tarantino's claims that " Death Proof " contains his best dialogue exchanges ever and that he is in the same league as Preston Sturges and Mark Twain as a writer ludicrously egomaniacal . Luckily , Kurt Russell is on hand to lend some much-needed gravitas to the proceedings ; interestingly , his character goes through quite a surprising change throughout the course of " Death Proof " ( and I agree wholeheartedly with Michael Elliott that the two halves of this section actually happened in reverse ) . However , where this segment really scores is in the action sequences ? alternately shocking ( the repeated collision sequence and McGowan's vicious murder ) , thrilling ( the car chase ) and crowd-pleasing ( Russell's come-uppance ) rather than merely pure slam-bang as in " Planet Terror " ( in spite of all its purposeful political incorrectness ) - which really elevates Tarantino's piece above that of Rodriguez . Having said that , it's still not quite up to the level of his earlier work ( for instance , the KILL BILL saga ? which is the closest to it in feel and approach ? is much better ) and I'd say this is Tarantino's weakest effort to date . In conclusion , another head-scratcher for me was that , in spite of all the admirable effort ( mentioned above ) on the part of the film-makers to replicate the grindhouse ' feel ' , the stories themselves were then set in modern-day America ( cue the needlessly regular use of CGI effects in Rodriguez's section and that of mobile phones in Tarantino's ) which , for me , rather defeated the purpose . The eclectic bunch of trailers ( contributed by Eli Roth , Edgar Wright , Rob Zombie and Rodriguez himself ) are campy fun and an inspired addition to this decidedly mixed bag .
JANE EYRE ( TV ) ( Delbert Mann , 1970 )	I had previously watched the classic 1944 version with Orson Welles and Joan Fontaine ; this later adaptation is well enough done and acted as TV movies go , but can't really be compared artistically ( especially with respect to the narrative's Gothic trappings , much more vividly captured in atmospheric black-and-white ) . It was surprising to find George C . Scott in a romantic melodrama , but it's he who gives the film life ; in any case , this seemed to start him off tackling the classics for TV ? following JANE EYRE with BEAUTY AND THE BEAST ( 1976 ) , OLIVER TWIST ( 1982 ) , A Christmas CAROL ( 1984 ) and even MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE ( 1986 ) ! Susannah York is a good match for him and brings reasonable passion to the title character . The supporting cast , then , is peppered with veteran character actors such as Jack Hawkins , Kenneth Griffith and , best of all , Ian Bannen ( as the religious fanatic who proposes to Jane ) . I own but have never read the Charlotte Bronte novel ; still , from what I recall of the earlier version , this one's pretty faithful ? and it has suitably literate dialogue to boot . John Williams , then , delivers a sweeping and heavily romantic score .
House Of Wax ( 2005 )	As much as I hate remakes , I always try to keep up with any modern horror movie which revisits classic territory . Still , although I knew beforehand that this film wasn't going to be a direct remake of either MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM ( 1933 ) or HOUSE OF WAX ( 1953 ) and despite the fact that its very title is even more appropriate to its content than it was for the Andre ' De Toth / Vincent Price version , I'd still would have preferred that it had been given a different title . But maybe that's too much of a hassle for today's breed of Hollywood screenwriters ? Anyhow , I'll say outright that this film has no reason to be this enjoyable . Frankly , I was expecting it to be pretty dull and lifeless , a by-the-numbers slasher pic made solely to pick up a few big bucks at the box office . However , it turned out to be a decently made , reasonably interesting and clever addition to the genre . Of course , the worst bits in the movie were the parts dealing exclusively with the teenagers ' antics and , in fact , only Elisha Cuthbert and Chad Michael Murray elicited any sympathy from me while the clichéd characterizations of the black guy and the geek could have been entirely dispensed with . Paris Hilton does nothing here to dispel in any way her image of a fun-loving , dumb blonde bimbo but , at least , she delivered the goods during her gory comeuppance and the chase sequence which preceded it . On the other hand , the best element in the film was the throwback to that 1960's Grand Guignolesque atmosphere prevalent in films like Robert Aldrich's WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE ? ( 1962 ) which , as it happens , is currently being revived theatrically at the local cinema in the Town Of Wax , complete with an opening detailing past events involving skeletons in a famous person's closet which turn out to have a huge bearing on what is happening to the teenagers whose exploits we are currently following . I didn't realize until I saw the final cast roll that Brian Van Holt actually played the role of both Sinclair brothers but he gives a good performance in both cases ? menacing and moving as the occasion requires . Of course , a film of this type rises or falls depending on the effectiveness of its scares and gore ; I would also add the cleverness with which the villain is exposed : in the case of HOUSE OF WAX , while it's not particularly scary , it is creepy , especially when it is revealed that the whole town is made of wax figures and clever when Elisha Cuthbert realizes that the kindly mechanic could well be the villain of the piece , or the twist ending when we learn that the dim-witted woodsman is another Sinclair sibling . The climactic fight sequence in which the House Of Wax melts away is very effective and exciting . Also , some of the gore ? the cutting off of Cuthbert's finger , the peeling away of the face of her boyfriend turned to wax , the geek's decapitation , Paris Hilton's impalement , etc . ? is an enthusiastic throwback to the grindhouse quality of 1970s American horror film and 1980s Italian / Spanish genre fare . All in all , quite a surprisingly watchable and pleasant diversion .
CARRY ON GIRLS ( Gerald Thomas , 1973 )	This latter-day " Carry On " entry doesn't feature such series stalwarts as Kenneth Williams , Hattie Jacques or Charles Hawtrey , but still manages to be great fun ? if , in no way , a classic . Council member Sid James ( tied up with hotel manageress Joan Sims ) decides to drum up business for their modest town by organizing a beauty contest . Kenneth Connor ( sporting a funny accent and fuzzy hair-do ) is the long-suffering Mayor ? who , apart from his office duties , has to contend on a daily basis with openly contemptuous wife Patsy Rowlands ( theirs is inspired mismatch casting indeed ) . Another couple is James ' best pal Bernard Bresslaw and his young wife Valerie Leon ( initially made to appear frumpy-looking but who eventually undergoes a make-over when , unbeknownst to her spouse , she determines to enter the contest herself out of jealousy ) . Barbara Windsor is " Miss Easy Rider " ( ! ) and she's involved in rivalry throughout ? erupting soon enough into a catfight in Sims ' hotel lobby ? with ex-roommate Sally Geeson . June Whitfield is the feminist council member who opposes the contest ; to this end , she engages photographer nephew Robin Askwith ( later star of several naughty " Confessions " films ? I've never watched any , but am on the point of acquiring a few ) to cover the preparations in order to uncover some misdeed which would allow her to put a stop to the whole ' debasing ' event . Jack Douglas as the hotel concierge incorporates his hilarious twitching routine ( also seen in CARRY ON ABROAD [ 1972 ] and " Lamp-Posts Of The Empire " , an episode from the CARRY ON LAUGHING [ 1975 ] TV series ) . The finale ? in which the contest is systematically sabotaged by the puritanical female townfolk ( including the Mayor's own wife ! ) is an undeniable highlight of the film but is , essentially , a direct lift from a much earlier entry in the series ? the superior CARRY ON TEACHER ( 1959 ) !
BODYGUARD ( Richard Fleischer , 1948 )	Up until a few weeks ago , I only knew cult 40s tough guy Lawrence Tierney from his role in Tarantino's RESERVOIR DOGS ( 1991 ) ; recently , however , I managed to watch his 2 vehicles released on DVD by Warners as part of their " Film Noir Collection Vol . 2 " , namely DILLINGER ( 1945 ) and BORN TO KILL ( 1947 ) . This Richard Fleischer film , then , would be my third from Tierney's short period of glory . Actually , the actor is the best thing about the whole movie - whose story , amazingly , was co-written by a very young Robert Altman ! - as it's certainly a minor noir , albeit an enjoyable one ; indeed , Tierney's cynical , no-nonsense attitude ( reminiscent of Bogart , Mitchum and Robert Ryan ) provides a good deal of amusement throughout . Still , the plot - a discredited cop uncovering corruption in a meat-packing company , when appointed to protect the elderly female proprietor - is nothing special and also kind of dreary ; besides , the jovial personality of leading lady Priscilla Lane is as much unsuited to Tierney's hard-boiled façade as she is to the inherent bleakness of the genre !
MUTINY ( Edward Dmytryk , 1952 )	This low-budget swashbuckler ( albeit filmed in murky color ) proved somewhat better than anticipated ? given that the Leonard Maltin Film Guide deemed to slap it with a measly rating ! To begin with , it's bolstered by such imposing credentials as scriptwriter Philip Yordan , composer Dmitri Tiomkin and , of course , director Dmytryk . Incidentally , this was the latter's first American film after his unfortunate stint as one of " The Hollywood Ten " ? which saw him imprisoned and then exiled for non-collaboration in the McCarthy witch-hunts ; however , within two years Dmytryk would renounce Communism and turn friendly witness , which is how he got back into Hollywood's A-list and eventually helmed such high-profile titles as THE CAINE MUTINY ( 1954 ) and THE YOUNG LIONS ( 1958 ) . With this in mind , the political subtext regarding the character of Patrick Knowles ? aping his frequent co-star Errol Flynn as a disgraced naval captain who's forced to serve as First Mate to a younger officer ( an unlikely yet effectively cast Mark Stevens ) ? can hardly be a coincidence ! Interestingly , the only woman involved ( played by Angela Lansbury ) is depicted as a femme fatale and Knowles ' opportunistic lover ? who goads him into usurping Stevens ' leadership , and even connives with the crew ( led by hook-handed Gene Evans and Rhys Williams ) to steal the ship's cargo , a camouflaged ' treasure ' intended for the U . S . A . ' s 1812 war effort ! At only 77 minutes , there's more talk than action ? but the latter does come in at the climax , where it's both efficient and versatile : following the mutiny itself , we get the expected sea battle culminating in the deployment of an archaic form of submarine ( which , in turn , leads to Knowles ' self-sacrifice ) . In the end , I would have liked to add MUTINY to my collection ? but had to forego any such intention due to the substandard quality ( typified by intermittent picture fuzziness ) of the print utilized for Platinum's budget DVD release .
AU SECOURS ! ( Abel Gance , 1924 )	Typical haunted house comedy with neglected French comic Max Linder ( who recalls both Terry-Thomas and Raul Julia ! ) , in which the hero – a dapper member of a social club – is dared to spend an hour in such a place by its current owner . Incidentally , the film itself seems to have been made as a bet between Gance and Linder ( of whose films this is my first sample ) ; given its inclusion in the Scary Movie Challenge , it’s ironic that Linder and his wife committed ritual suicide on Halloween Day , 1925 ! Anyhow , the ghouls that terrify the hero aren’t just the usual gimmicks such as skeletons or headless / monstrous figures – but also an assortment of reptiles ( snakes , crocodiles ) and wild animals ( tigers , lions ) ! Despite the obvious danger to his life , Max holds firm . . . but is finally deterred from keeping up the bet to the very last when his wife calls at the house and tells him she’s being menaced ( which is , of course , a nasty trick pulled by the owner to ensure his triumph in the matter ! ) . While it’s not exactly remarkable in the horror / comedy stakes – and repetitive to boot , not least because it has Max mostly stuck in one room ( incidentally , I watched the 23-minute version and not the reportedly longer ‘restored’ one at 40 ) ! – Gance once again lays on the technique ( though the image unfortunately suffered from distracting jitters all the way through ) : especially creative is the scene in which Max is hanging on to a chandelier which , declining under his weight , literally pulls the picture down with it !
THE PHANTOM ( Simon Wincer , 1996 )	I've been on a roll watching adventure / comic-strip films since Christmas , so I decided to check this one out as well : curiously enough , though , I don't recall it coming out back in the day ? unlike , say , THE SHADOW ( 1994 ) ? which , incidentally , followed in quick succession . For the record , I read Roger Ebert's surprisingly enthusiastic appraisal of THE PHANTOM ( which he called one of the most handsome films ever made ! ) prior to watching the DVD . While it's certainly enjoyable and remarkably evocative of Saturday matinée ' serials ( the character was actually brought to the screen in this form in the 1940s ? incidentally , this version is available on DVD through VCI ) , however , I found this particular film to be too low-key for its own good . Billy Zane is ideally cast as the athletic Phantom ( his alter ego gets surprisingly little exposure ) , Treat Williams is the suave bordering-on-camp villain ( being set in the turbulent late 1930s , he's depicted as having dictatorial ambitions which he intends to achieve with any means possible ) , Kristy Swanson provides Zane's love interest ( in both his guises ) , Catherine Zeta-Jones is one of Williams ' associates who competes with Swanson for The Phantom's attention and eventually has a change of heart , Patrick McGoohan is Zane's father and an earlier incarnation of the seemingly undying Phantom ( he's dubbed " The Ghost Who Walks " ) . Action sequences are well enough handled ( particularly when he jumps from an aircraft onto his galloping faithful steed ) , and modest special effects come into play where the magical skulls ( Williams ' ultimate goal ) are involved .
Texas , ADIOS ( Ferdinando Baldi , 1966 )	The first and , presumably , best of director Baldi's six Spaghetti Westerns ( I'd watched his last ? BLINDMAN [ 1971 ] co-starring Ringo Starr [ ! ] ? as part of the Italian B-movie retrospective during the 2004 Venice Film Festival ) finds genre icon Franco Nero in good stoic form as a man out to avenge his father's death ( incidentally , it was the star's own first genre outing ? to be followed that same year by two even better efforts in Sergio Corbucci's star-making DJANGO and Lucio Fulci's MASSACRE TIME ) . Against his better judgement , he's accompanied on the peril-fraught odyssey ( which takes him from Texas to Mexico ) by his younger sibling ? played by Alberto Dell'Acqua ( using the hilarious pseudonym Cole Kitosch ! ) . However , this turns out to have a strong bearing on the plot ? despite typical scenes in which the inexperienced and impulsive kid has to be rescued within an inch of his life by big brother ? since the man they're after results in being Kitosch's real father ( having raped Nero's mother immediately after bumping off her outlaw hubby , an event seen in a rather limp flashback ) . In the meantime , the villain has been lording it over a poor Mexican province ( as much at ease casually picking off rebelling peones with his prize pistol as when playing the pipe organ in his living-room ! ) ? aided by uncouth and alcoholic Alcalde Livio Lorenzon ( even if it's later established that the latter's more human , and bitter , than he lets on ) . With this in mind , the script demonstrates atypical care towards characterization ? in fact , another figure who's given his due is that of the lawyer played by Luigi Pistilli ( a versatile " Euro-Cult " stalwart ) who secretly hopes to organize an uprising against the tyrant , and constantly pleads with Nero to join their ranks . By the way , one further twist on the Spaghetti Western scenario is that , at one point , it's the villainous hordes who are ambushed by the good guys ! The action throughout , then , is pretty good ( including some quite vigorous fistfights ) ? starting off with the credit sequence involving a lengthy shoot-out , eventually stopped by cool sheriff Nero , between a bounty hunter and his quarry ; the latter is accompanied by the evocative and melancholy theme tune ( the work of Spanish composer Anton Abril ) , which can be heard several times during the course of the film without overstaying its welcome . For the record , I'd first gotten hold of this one in Italian ? which is always the preferred language for me with this type of film ? but it kept skipping over a good part of that opening confrontation due to some glitch ( the same fate , albeit to an ever greater extent , had actually befallen another Spaghetti Western with Nero that I acquired in the past but subsequently couldn't watch as a result i . e . Luigi Bazzoni's MAN , PRIDE AND VENGEANCE [ 1968 ] ) ; in the case of Texas , ADIOS I had to make do with the next best thing ? an English-dubbed edition ( even if Nero himself , who usually re-records his own dialogue parts on the English soundtracks of his films , is dubbed , too ) . At the end of the day , this is a minor genre offering but a reasonably effective and enjoyable one nevertheless .
Borat : Cultural Learnings Of America For Make Benefit Glorious Nation Of Kazakhstan ( Larry Charles , 2006 )	I wasn't into Sacha Baron Cohen's previous alter ego , rapper Ali G , at all ; I didn't think I'd be drawn to this character ( who has garnered as much admiration as contempt either ) , given his sexist nature ? but , at least , it provides a wider range of targets and opportunities for controversy . Incidentally , the head-shaking reaction which usually greets Borat is ultimately more of a comment on his ostensibly cultured ' victims ' than the unsophisticated hero himself . The film itself is patchy but mercifully short ? and , surprisingly , I found it to be genuinely inspired at times ( even if its brand of savage no-holds barred satire has been more stylishly explored by Monty Python 35 years ago ) ; besides , the dinner-table defecation was much better done by Luis Bunuel in an unforgettable scene from THE PHANTOM OF LIBERTY ( 1974 ) ! Anyway , it generally plays like a live-action version of " South Park " ( that series ' creators , in fact , receive a special thanks during the end credits here ) . Some scenes are undeniably uproarious ? his rendition of the national anthem of Kazakhstan at a rodeo ; the dinner sequence in a Southern household ( mentioned above ) ; the mayhem at an antique shop ; and the lengthy nude fisticuff between Borat and his heavy-set manager ( which is where the film really oversteps the threshold of grossness ) . However , other ' sketches ' fall miserably flat ? in particular , the entire Pamela Anderson episode ( which actually takes about half the running-time ! ) is an embarrassment : this section includes Borat's meeting with a group of wasted kids in a trailer ( which is how the hero gets wise to Anderson's marital status ) and his eventual brush with a community of revivalist Christians .
MESSIAH OF EVIL ( Willard Huyck and , uncredited , Gloria Katz , 1973 )	I watched this via a 9-movie budget set entitled " The Living Dead " which also contained KING OF THE ZOMBIES ( 1941 ) and the upcoming I EAT YOUR SKIN ( 1964 ) and THE THIRSTY DEAD ( 1974 ) ; actually , I had originally planned to rent this for the Halloween challenge but it didn’t pan out . Although I have been vaguely aware of the film , I was prompted to actively seek this out after learning a few days ago about it being among Mario Bava biographer Tim Lucas’ 10 all-time favorite horror films ! Still , I was surprised to find out that the bland , generic title DEAD PEOPLE ( rather than the more evocative , not to mention popular , MESSIAH OF EVIL ) was the film’s original one . For the record , Huyck and Katz later that same year went on to work with George Lucas on American GRAFFITI ( 1973 ) and , a decade later , with Steven Spielberg on INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM ( 1984 ) – but are perhaps still best-known for the notorious guilty pleasure HOWARD THE DUCK ( 1986 ) ! The film features a surprisingly decent and eclectic cast of newcomers ( Marianna Hill – from MEDIUM COOL [ 1969 ] – and Anitra Ford – from INVASION OF THE BEE GIRLS [ 1973 ] , another cult horror offering she made that year ) and veterans ( Elisha Cook Jr . – a memorable bit as a wide-eyed madman – and Royal Dano – as Hill’s haunted artist father ) . Hero Michael Greer shares an ambiguous , libertine relationship with two girls ( sultry Ford and spunky Joy Bangs ) which is reminiscent of PERFORMANCE ( 1970 ) – even down to the ( milder ) bathtub stuff . Apparently , directors Walter Hill and Bill L . Norton also feature in the film but I wouldn’t really know ! Much like LET’S SCARE JESSICA TO DEATH ( 1971 ) , this is a wildly offbeat and low-key horror piece that’s surprisingly accomplished ( if still highly uneven ) . Apart from an unsettling synthesizer score by Phillan Bishop , it features several creepily effective shock moments : Ford’s entrapment in a supermarket by the zombies ( anticipating DAWN OF THE DEAD [ 1978 ] ! ) ; Bangs being enclosed by zombies in a cinema ( inspiring DEMONS [ 1985 ] perhaps ? ) – amusingly , the program being advertised at that time was " Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye " ; and the zombies’ vicious climactic assault on Hill’s home ( bursting through the ceiling , door and windows ) . Eerily , the first sign of oncoming zombification here is blood trickling from the eye ; a creepy-looking , rat-eating albino trucker who appears intermittently emerges , ultimately , to be a prominent figure among the army of the living dead . The film’s historical / mystical explanation of mass hysteria – involving a dark stranger emerging from the sea and a prophecy wherein the moon turns blood-red – is intriguing but too muddled to really satisfy ( though I concede that , at least , it tries to do something original with this popular theme ) . Unfortunately , for MESSIAH OF EVIL , it appears that this Public Domain print – hazy , worn-out , panned-and-scanned – is the only one widely available . . .
THE DRILLER KILLER { Edited Version } ( Abel Ferrara , 1979 )	With this , I've watched 11 films from this director : I can't say I'm a fan , though , because I didn't like many of them ! This , however , is one of his most discussed efforts ? having acquired notoriety due to its being singled out during the UK's " Video Nasties " case of the early 1980s . Ferrara made a couple more horror films ? namely the OK but unnecessary BODY SNATCHERS ( 1993 ) reworking and THE ADDICTION ( 1995 ) , his depressing equation of vampire and junkie ? but this is most certainly the one that leaves the greatest impact . It's far from entirely successful , but its unflinching look at New York low-life is quite unnerving and rivals that seen in TAXI DRIVER ( 1976 ) ! Interestingly , the director himself plays the protagonist ( under the alias Jimmy Laine ) ? he's a painter frustrated by his heritage ( the first scene has him meeting his bum father in church but failing to acknowledge their connection ) and his surroundings ( he lives in a dingy flat with his bisexual girlfriend and her dazed lover ) . He's further aggravated by the demands of his employer and a punk band's occupation of the apartment underneath ( their scenes are fairly annoying and , given that none of them subsequently figure among the fatalities , this subplot tends to come across as just padding ) . Eventually , the hero snaps and goes out on the streets at night attacking tramps and bystanders with an electric drill ? but this is no mere exploitation flick a ' la THE TOOLBOX MURDERS ( 1978 ) , and it must have confused audiences back in the day expecting just those kind of cheap thrills ! Incidentally , the director's trademark self-indulgence is most evident here in the flashes to his character's nightmare visions and the open-ended finale in which the entire screen unaccountably turns to blood-red . Unfortunately , the R2 DVD I watched was trimmed by 1 minute due to its graphic content ; I don't know whether the confusion felt at the end is smoothed over in the full-length version , particularly with respect to the fate of the lesbian / junkie ' lodger ' . The film , therefore , exudes an undeniable raw power throughout which ? ironically ? could only be possible thanks to its very amateurishness . Interestingly , while I was somewhat let down by a number of cult 1980s horror titles , I find those emanating from the previous decade generally deserving of their reputation ( a ' classic ' I've been postponing for what seems like forever is Wes Craven's THE HILLS HAVE EYES [ 1977 ] ) ?
THE CLIMAX ( George Waggner , 1944 )	This much-maligned Boris Karloff vehicle is actually not too bad ; then again , the 1943 version of PHANTOM OF THE OPERA - for which this was a follow-up , conveniently filmed on the same expensive sets - isn't very popular with horror fans either . Many have stated that Karloff sleepwalks through his role here : true , it doesn't really extend his range but , given that he was headlining a super-production and being the consummate professional that he was , I hardly believe he could afford to be indifferent about it ( and , in any case , it returned him to territory he had already covered in CHARLIE CHAN AT THE OPERA [ 1936 ] ) ! It's fairly enjoyable in itself , if not a little silly ( Karloff demanding that his sweetheart stop her glorious singing career merely because he's jealous of all the admiration she's getting , his hypnotic control over the Susanna Foster character being exercised by means of a flask of atomizer { throat spray } ! ) , and the lavishly colorful production is certainly attractive . The musical numbers are more ' modern ' than those in PHANTOM , though there are still too many of them ( remaining , in any case , a matter of taste ! ) . Foster does okay by her role but I agree that Turhan Bey is totally miscast and almost sinks the film ; however , the supporting cast is pretty good - above all Gale Sondergaard ( in a surprisingly sympathetic role ) , Thomas Gomez and Ludwig Stossel . The film's best sequences would have to be the murder of Karloff's wife , the hypnotism sessions ( highlighting Karloff's glaring eyes in close-up ) and the fiery climax { sic } ( as in THE BLACK CAT [ 1934 ] , Karloff keeps the body of his dead wife embalmed in a secret room ) - in essence , all the horrific elements there are . P . S . According to the " Classic Horror Film Board " , as was the case with Universal's initial DVD release of Dracula ( 1931 ) , this film is missing the underscoring during the opening sequence ( not having watched THE CLIMAX previously , I couldn't have known about this ) - how the hell does something like this happen . . . ? !
HEIDI ( Allan Dwan , 1937 )	This , along with several other Shirley Temple vehicles , has been an Italian TV perennial for years ? particularly over the Christmas period ? but I never bothered with it , despite the involvement of director Dwan . Just a couple of weeks ago , it turned up again and I even recorded it ? despite being both dubbed and colorized ! However , since I managed to find it on DVD , I opted to watch HEIDI ' as intended ' . Incidentally , not only have I recently acquired ? or watched ? a number of the director's later efforts , but I've even watched a later TV adaptation of the Johanna Spyri novel . As it turned out , the film is an utterly professional ( and typically handsome ) Darryl F . Zanuck production but I think that the story was tailored far too much to suit the ebullient child star's usual formula : not only do we get Arthur Treacher ( receiving unwarranted third billing ! ) as a typically bemused butler , but Temple is made to act as cupid between the new parson and the local schoolmarm ; besides , we're treated to a totally irrelevant fantasy song-and-dance number , two separate antagonists in the shape of her aunt and jealous governess ? not to mention the apparently requisite corny final close-up ! Among the differences I noticed from the 1968 version ( which is probably more faithful to the source material ) is the fact that Temple befriends the invalid child immediately and even gets to be the one who cures her psychosomatic ailment ! Besides , the incidents which climax the later version i . e . Grandfather's religious redemption and Clara's ' cure ' itself occur earlier here , whereas the highlight of the film is taken up by a sleigh-chase in the snow with the Police pursuing the hysterical Grandfather ! The overly made-up Jean Hersholt is fine as the latter , while the supporting cast also includes Mary Nash as the overbearing Governess , Sidney Blackmer as Clara's father ( whose role is much reduced here ) and Sig Rumann in a bit part as a police official . All in all , then , I found the 1968 TV adaptation to be the superior effort .
Masters Of Horror : Valerie On The Stairs ( Mick Garris , 2006 ) ( TV )	This isn't well-regarded on the IMDb , but I personally liked it well enough . While the plot ( based , as were the recently-viewed " Candyman " films , on a story by Clive Barker ) features several well-worn elements , the mix proves intriguing and reasonably compelling : failed author , eccentric household , ghostly damsel-in-distress , literary characters coming to life , etc . Even if there were only two noted performers ? the ever-reliable ( and quirky ) Christopher Lloyd and the Candyman himself , Tony Todd ( once again , playing a figure of mystery and menace , a rather effectively made-up demon ) ? the rest of the cast does well enough by their roles as well , especially the hero and heroine ( the entrancing Clare Grant ) and the two older women in the boarding-house . As was the case with the two previous " Masters Of Horror " episodes I've watched ? both , incidentally , helmed by Dario Argento ? this too confirms that TV has finally achieved maturity ( with its graphic display of sexuality and violence , and the tackling of subjects previously considered taboo , in this case , a dash of lesbianism ) . In fact , not being into modern TV series at all , I'd only previously encountered such explicitness ? where , however , it was mostly gratuitous and even off-putting ? in ROME ( 2005 ) . . .
CARRY ON AT YOUR CONVENIENCE ( Gerald Thomas , 1971 )	Considered by many the best ever " Carry On " film , I think I still prefer CARRY ON . . . UP THE KHYBER ( 1968 ) to it , but it's certainly one of the more tolerable entries in the series . Essentially an update of I'M ALL RIGHT , JACK ! ( 1959 ) in its concern over working conditions in a factory and the frequent strikes ordered by the union's representative ( usually over a trifle , or even a technicality in the regulations ! ) , the fact that the manufacture involved is toiletware , the lavatorial humor associated with this team is quite appropriate here - though it never descends to the grossness which seems to be the norm for today's would-be comedies . Most of the regulars of the series can be seen strutting their stuff ( though perhaps the most notable contribution is given by newcomer Kenneth Cope as the shop steward ) and there's no shortage of lewd remarks but , as I said , it's all done in fun ( while these films may have been restricted to adult audiences back in the day , they're quite PG stuff today ! ) . There's still a bit of padding involved - such as Sid James ' winnings at the races ( following the predictions of his wife's pet bird ! ) , the love triangle involving Cope , Jacki Piper ( as James ' daughter ) and Richard O'Callaghan ( as the son of factory boss Kenneth Williams ) and especially the lengthy outing in Brighton ; all things considered , however , an enjoyable vintage comedy which is ideal viewing for the festive season .
THE SECRET OF CONVICT LAKE ( Michael Gordon , 1951 )	Unusual Western which creates a wonderful atmosphere throughout with the gleaming black-and-white cinematography of the snowy setting ; the narrative is set in motion with the appearance of five escaped prisoners ( hungry , tired and with the law on their tails ) at a small backwoods village , which they presently find inhabited only by the womenfolk . The former are led by Zachary Scott and , in their majority , expect to have a run of the place ? but have reckoned without the resilience of the women , who have learned to defend themselves from outsiders . Besides , Scott is constantly at loggerheads with Glenn Ford : the latter had been convicted by the false evidence given at the trial by a local ( the intended of heroine Gene Tierney ) , and Ford has come there expressly for the purpose of revenge ? while Scott is eager to lay his hands on the fortune he believes Ford stole and , consequently , is hidden there ! Due to a raging blizzard , the women are forced to extend their hospitality to the prisoners ; however , the two groups live in isolation from one another , until the barn is accidentally set on fire and the men lend a helping hand ? which breaks down the barrier if only for a little while . Two other important female roles are those of Ann Dvorak as Tierney's prospective sister-in-law ( a shrewish spinster who's subsequently given the runaround by the slimy Scott ? only so that he can get her to reveal the location of the weapons , which the women have hidden away ) and Ethel Barrymore as , naturally , the matriarch of the settlement ( bearing a strong will to make up for her fading health ) . Among the convicts are Cyril Cusack ( the philosopher in the group ) and Jack Lambert ( the equally unavoidable brutish thug ) ; another is a harmless-looking young man who goes into blackouts when contradicted and is then gripped by a homicidal fury ? he strikes a friendship with the youngest in the place ( Barbara Bates ) but is soon forcing himself on the girl when he gets her alone ? which leads him to a fight with Ford and then has to contend with the wrath of the other women , who promptly attack him with their pitch-forks ! Of course , Ford and Tierney themselves develop feelings for one another ? and , ultimately , the latter confesses that she doesn't love her fiancée ( having accepted him only out of gratitude for the attentions he gave Tierney when down on her luck ) . Eventually , the menfolk of the village turn up and the convicts have to shoot it out with them ( minutes only after Dvorak has disclosed the hiding-place of the money ? stolen by her brother ? and which Tierney has given to Scott so that he and his companions could leave ! ) ; amid all this hubbub , Ford has a showdown with his old nemesis ( witnessed by Tierney ) . The finale is quite splendid : with the weather now calm , the posse has resumed the chase ? arriving on the scene just as the townsfolk are holding services over five graves ( whose occupants the former take to be the fugitives ) ; at first , the locals were divided over whether to give Ford away or not but , after Tierney has pleaded his case , Barrymore's authority over the community ensures that everyone is of the same mind . Though essentially modest ( running for a mere 83 minutes ) , the film is both good-looking and well-acted ? very much an under-appreciated genre effort , evoking memories of such classics as THE OX-BOW INCIDENT ( 1943 ) and YELLOW SKY ( 1948 ) , which ought to be on DVD ( God knows Fox have done well by their vintage catalogue ) . By the way , I've got two more exotic Glenn Ford titles from this same era to catch up with ? namely APPOINTMENT IN HONDURAS ( 1953 ) and PLUNDER OF THE SUN ( 1953 ) which thankfully , are on DVD ?
THE WRONG BOX ( Bryan Forbes , 1966 )	A typical all-star extravaganza of the 1960s ( which I had also first caught on Italian TV ) based on a novel by Robert Louis Stevenson , this black comedy perhaps aspires to be a zany updating of KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS ( 1949 ) as it revolves around the assorted mishaps of various people on the way to gaining the proceeds of a lottery . However , being patchy overall ? insufficiently witty and often resorting to heavy-handed comedy which outstays its welcome ? it fails to achieve that film's level of artistic merit ( culminating in a fracas at a graveyard , then , it also brings to mind the contemporaneous THE LOVED ONE [ 1965 ] ) ; however , we do begin promisingly enough with a number of nice skits wherein the long line of candidates to the fortune is severely diminished ( there's even a gag involving an accident-prone Queen Victoria ! ) . As for the remarkable cast , it's led by Ralph Richardson ( amusingly bugging everybody with his pomposity ? a coachman whispers to himself " God save us ! " at Richardson's hope that they meet again ) and John Mills ( atypically involved in pratfalls , especially when attempting to do in brother Richardson : the two live next door to each other and , yet , haven't spoken in 40 years ! ) as the last survivors of the deadly tontine . Also on hand are Michael Caine ( as Mills ' grandson ) who shares a rather boring , and unnecessarily flashily-presented , romance with Nanette Newman ( Richardson's ward and director Forbes ' real-life wife ) , Peter Cook and Dudley Moore ( making for a characteristically unscrupulous albeit bumbling duo ? incidentally , I should get to their maligned spoof rendition of THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES [ 1978 ] presently ) , Wilfrid Lawson ( who's fun as Mills ' doddering butler ) and Thorley Walters ( the lawyer charged with handing over the money to the eventual winner ) . Besides , we also get guest spots by Peter Sellers and Tony Hancock in decidedly ill-advised character turns as eccentric doctor and befuddled Police Inspector respectively . The evocative period detail ( courtesy of cinematographer Gerry Turpin and production designer Ray Simm ) and John Barry's lovely score are flawless , however . For the record , the Spanish ( ! ) DVD edition I acquired is hardly optimal ? being not only regrettably panned-and-scanned but even going out-of-synch during the climax ? yet it will have to suffice for the moment .
QUATERMASS ( TV ) { Episodes 1-4 } ( Piers Haggard , 1979 )	I viewed this as part of a two-film retrospective of John Mills titles ( the other being THE SINGER NOT THE SONG [ 1961 ] ) to commemorate the centenary of his birth on the 22nd of February . Incidentally , I'd purchased the R4 DVD edition ? and two other Nigel Kneale-scripted made-for-TV efforts , THE YEAR OF THE SEX OLYMPICS ( 1968 ) and BEASTS ( 1976 ) ? following the death last year of that noted sci-fi literary figure , one of my favorite exponents of the genre , but hadn't yet gotten around to watching it until now ! Of course , this is the fourth ( and last ) of Kneale's serials revolving around Professor Bernard Quatermass ? submitting yet another scary ( but totally persuasive ) scenario to challenge our established notions of humanity , the world and beyond . Interestingly , the protagonist was played by a different actor each time : here , Mills turns in a typically excellent ( albeit low-key ) performance . However , the muddled apocalyptic plot ? in which space missions go horribly wrong , Britain is reduced to a wasteland , a mass of fanatical but deluded youth is " harvested " ( read exterminated ) , senior citizens are forced to literally live underground , etc . ? is somehow insufficient for the film's 200-minute length ; this eventually gives rise to a fair bit of repetitiveness throughout ( particularly with respect to the gibberish chants of the Planet People ) . The serial does culminate in an intense and moving finale in which Quatermass meets up with his missing granddaughter , who has joined the ranks of the Planet People , just as he's set to fire a nuclear missile at the death ray from outer space ; about to perish himself ( from a heart attack ! ) , it's she who guides his movements in saving the world . One of the definite assets here is the effectively moody synthesizer score ; besides , the supporting cast is led by Simon MacCorkindale ( from JAWS 3-D [ 1983 ] and the MANIMAL [ 1983 ] TV series ) ? who's good in his role of the young scientist aiding Quatermass understand the extraterrestrial phenomenon ; a histrionic Barbara Kellerman appears as his wife , who soon falls victim to the devastation ; Margaret Tyzack ( 2001 : A SPACE ODYSSEY [ 1968 ] ) , Brenda Fricker ( future Oscar winner for MY LEFT FOOT [ 1989 ] ) and actress / rocker Toyah Willcox also appear . While not up to Kneale's earlier QUATERMASS scripts in the long run , this is still quite good ? with the 20-year gap since that character's last TV appearance enabling a far smoother production . In fact , there was no need to adapt it for the cinema as Hammer had done with the first three ; rather , the serial was probably made with this in mind ( director Haggard had made another cult-based supernatural horror piece ? THE BLOOD ON SATAN'S CLAW [ 1971 ] ) and subsequently got reduced to about half its length for theatrical exhibition . Originally shot in Panavision , the four episodes are however presented here open-matte so as to preserve the standard TV format ; the Australian 3-Disc Set I purchased , then , thoughtfully includes both versions .
THE YAKUZA ( Sydney Pollack , 1974 )	During the 1980s , our national TV channel used to show vintage Hollywood movies every weekend and Saturday night fare generally consisted of 1970s action flicks . This had been one of them and , although my father did tape it , I didn't catch the film back then and no tangible opportunity to watch it had presented itself over the years until now ( the film is included in Warners ' " Robert Mitchum : The Signature Collection " 6-Disc Box Set ) . For this reason alone , therefore – but also in view of Mitchum's involvement , the noir trappings of the plot and the exotic locale – THE YAKUZA is a title which has long intrigued me . Sydney Pollack may seem a very odd choice for director here , especially considering how in the last 30 years or so , he has become more than anything else renowned as a director of glossy , conventional dramas ; as a matter of fact , Robert Aldrich was first intended to direct Lee Marvin in it and , at some point , even Martin Scorsese's name was banded about . Even so , Pollack was much more adventurous as he was starting out – never more so than when making the eccentric , existentialist war movie CASTLE KEEP ( 1969 ; another film I caught up with fairly recently ) , with THE YAKUZA itself coming pretty close in terms of stretching his talent . For the record , he quickly followed the latter with his finest movie of the decade , the superb espionage thriller THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR ( 1975 ) – which I really ought to acquire on DVD despite its being a bare-bones disc . The enthusiastic DVD Savant review of THE YAKUZA mentions how co-writer Paul Schrader was inspired by the latter-day John Ford Western masterpiece THE SEARCHERS ( 1956 ) dealing as it does with a similar kidnapping of a girl and the perilous odyssey to retrieve her . The hand of Robert Towne , the other scriptwriter , is most evident in the final revelation ( which is as jaw-dropping as the one for his previous work – coincidentally also a noir with allusions to the Orient , CHINATOWN [ 1974 ] , and which eventually won him an Oscar ) . By this time , Western audiences had become well-versed in the Samurai and their code – but The Yakuza was a novel concept , which was perhaps seen as topical vis-a'-vis the re-emergence of gangland dramas in the wake of THE GODFATHER ( 1972 ) . The film , in fact , has profound things to say about Honor , Obligation and Family ( with a remarkably harsh way of demonstrating one's penance ) . On top of it all , then , is a magnificent lyrical score by Dave Grusin . For an action movie , it is very deliberately paced but this only serves to make the handful of fight sequences all the more electrifying . Pollack's direction is admirably stylish throughout the film's 112 minutes ( though the Japanese version is said to be even longer and , in fact , the promotional featurette which is part of the DVD supplements does depict the shooting of a couple of scenes which aren't in the finished film as presented here ! ) and remarkably balances superbly choreographed action sequences with thoughtful passages – particularly concerning Mitchum's place in this environment ( while typically understated , the performance by the star in this case allows emotion to seep through his bulky exterior and tough persona ) . It's worth mentioning here that Mitchum's career was going through a renaissance itself around thus time , primarily through such films as THE FRIENDS OF EDDIE COYLE ( 1973 ) and FAREWELL , MY LOVELY ( 1975 ) , but subsequently he also got to kick some ass in Hong Kong for THE AMSTERDAM KILL ( 1977 ; which I'd love to get a chance to watch now ) . The rest of the American cast is compact but carefully chosen : Brian Keith ( as an opportunistic businessman , the father of the girl abducted for his having slighted The Yakuza , as well as Mitchum's best friend and old war buddy ) , Richard Jordan ( quite good as Keith's young underling who tags along with Mitchum to Japan , ostensibly to keep an eye on him , but who didn't count on the pull of the Orient and , more specifically , the presence of a beguiling young girl – daughter of Mitchum's old flame ) and Herb Edelman ( as another war veteran who has stayed on and cultivated his knowledge of weaponry , extending to a fascination for Japanese swords ) . The ' native ' actors are equally impressive , especially Ken Takakura ( as the enigmatic but proficient ex-Yakuza drawn back into the underworld as a favor to Mitchum – the actor was apparently a fixture of this type of violent entertainment ) and Eiji Okada ( suitably authoritative and menacing as the unscrupulous Yakuza boss – he's best-known for playing Emmanuelle Riva's Japanese lover in Alain Resnais ' landmark film Hiroshima MON AMOUR [ 1959 ] and the entomologist hero of the award-winning erotic drama WOMAN IN THE DUNES [ 1964 ] ) . Finally , it's worth noting that I recently acquired on VHS Kinji Fukasaku's BATTLES WITHOUT HONOR AND HUMANITY ( 1973 ) – the first of several entries in a series of films collectively known as THE YAKUZA PAPERS , though I doubt I'll have time to check it out presently . Ironically enough , over the Christmas period an Italian TV channel presented a rare screening of " the ultimate in Japanese Yakuza movies " according to Paul Schrader himself – RED PEONY GAMBLER : FLOWER CARDS MATCH ( 1969 ) – but given that my mother broke a leg that very night , I was decidedly in no mood to watch subtitled fare . . .
CHARLIE CHAN IN Egypt ( Louis King , 1935 )	After CHARLIE CHAN AT THE OPERA ( 1936 ) , this is the best entry in the series I've watched so far : it plays almost like a " Mummy " horror film with its ancient - curse - causing - several - deaths plot ( though the climax reveals them to have been committed by human hands ) , augmented by the shadowy style typical of those films and even some genuine frissons of its own . By this time , Warner Oland had grown very nicely into the role and the supporting cast is filled with many familiar faces of the era including Jameson Thomas , Frank Conroy , Nigel de Brulier and even the young Rita Hayworth ( as an Egyptian maid , a role that promises to have some involvement in the unraveling of the mystery but which , alas , proves fairly insignificant ) .
THE LAST KING OF Scotland ( Kevin MacDonald , 2006 )	Forest Whitaker deservedly won the Best Actor Oscar for his vivid portrayal of Ugandan dictator , General Idi Amin ( even though newsreel footage at the end shows there is not that much of a facial resemblance ) , who starts out as being fairly benign but gradually turns to mass-murdering tyranny through his paranoia and mood swings . Showing the events from the viewpoint of his out-of-his-league Scottish physician was an innovation but , eventually , this drags the film into dreary melodramatics when the doc impregnates one of Amin's wives and , ultimately , serves to render the film unfocused and overlong . The film is certainly very well done and generally compelling but , once one realizes that the Scottish doctor is a fictional character , the viewer is left wondering whether the director ( or the author of the book on which the script was based ) opted to take a foreigner's eye-view of this turbulent period in South African history because otherwise the project would have had no commercial momentum ! Not much barbarity is shown but , when it is , the results are quite chilling - such as the vivisected body of Amin's duplicitous wife and his hideous torture of the doctor practically in full view of the Entebbe hostages , scenes which wouldn't have been amiss in a horror film !
RATATOUILLE ( Brad Bird and Jan Pinkava , 2007 )	Surprising exploring rodents in the kitchen is every restaurateur's ( or housewife's ) nightmare but the makers of this amiable animated movie turn that situation nicely on its head by making their protagonist a first-class gourmet that conveniently guides his artless master to fame and fortune in the culinary arts . Despite being the secret son of a famous ( but subsequently ) disgraced chef , he is engaged as a caretaker in his late father's bistro and mistreated by just everybody , especially the ambitious Head Chef who has his own designs on the place . However , his biggest nemesis is the fearsome food critic ( splendidly voiced by Peter O'Toole ) whose scathing review had sent his own father to an early grave and is intent on finding out just what the fuss of the revamped restaurant is all about . Aiding him in ditching his persecutors ( including the belated appearance of a sanitary official ) are a tough but conventional female cook , the friendly and constantly inventive mouse and , at the climax ? just when everything seems lost after his employees quit him en masse upon discovering who the true gastronomical genius really is ? the rat's entire family who find themselves engaged as impromptu cooks ! RATATOUILLE won the Best Animated Feature Oscar and received a handful of other nominations including Best Screenplay and Best Music Score .
TRANS-EUROP-EXPRESS ( Alain Robbe-Grillet , 1966 )	Given that TRANS-EUROP-EXPRESS is the only movie directed by Alain Robbe-Grillet which the late conservative British film critic Leslie Halliwell reviewed in his celebrated " Film Guide " , one would think that it was more accessible than his usual reportedly impenetrable stuff and , in a way , it is – but still , the end result is hardly straightforward and almost as cerebral ! Jean-Louis Trintignant , in the first of four films he made with Robbe-Grillet , plays a novice drug courier tested by his future employers in carrying a stash of cocaine ( which is actually sugar ) by train and depositing it into a train station locker – but this simple task is fraught with any number of unexpected complications including police interrogation and night-time chases . Marie-France Pisier is a very beguiling presence here as a whore / double agent with whom Trintignant has several S & M encounters in a hotel room until her ‘double face’ drives him to murder . . . or does it ? Although I was aware that the actress had played Colette in Francois Truffaut’s Antoine Doinel series and had the leading role in the trashy THE OTHER SIDE OF MIDNIGHT ( 1977 ) , looking at her filmography just now I was surprised to learn that she was also in one of my favorite films , Luis Bunuel’s THE PHANTOM OF LIBERTY ( 1974 ) , as well as Jacques Rivette’s ambitious fantasy CELINE AND JULIE GO BOATING ( 1974 ; which I’ve just acquired via the BFI’s 2-Disc edition ) ! What this film has that the other Robbe-Grillet titles I’ve watched ( including THE IMMORTAL ONE [ 1963 ] ) don’t , is a surprisingly substantial dose of humor : in fact , the writer-director himself appears as a train passenger who is contemplating a film about drug-trafficking which ( given that he happens to be on the train himself ) would be an ideal vehicle for Jean-Louis Trintignant ! ; similarly , when Trintignant and Pisier go to a café he tells her that the waiter who had just served them was not a waiter at all but an actor playing a waiter ! ; during one of the various meetings with his shady employers , Trintignant is asked to repeat where he is supposed to meet his contact – implying a very complicated route – he simply replies " Where " ( at which his employer doesn’t even bat an eyelid ! ) , etc . At one point , Robbe-Grillet’s fellow passengers complain that drug-trafficking is no longer hip and that diamond-smuggling is the current criminal fad ; therefore , Trintignant & Co . exchange costumes and settings accordingly . . . before the director decides to stick to his original idea ( whim ? ) after all ! Incidentally , this ‘screenplay-in-the-making’ structure reminds one of the contemporaneous Hollywood comedy , Paris WHEN IT SIZZLES ( 1964 ) , which was itself a remake of an earlier French original – Julien Duvivier’s LA FETE A ' HENRIETTE ( 1952 ) . In fact , the whole self-referential element in the film and its heady spoof on the thriller genre recalls the Jean-Luc Godard of BREATHLESS ( 1960 ) , BAND OF OUTSIDERS ( 1964 ) , ALPHAVILLE ( 1965 ) and PIERROT LE FOU ( 1965 ) more than anything else . . . Unfortunately , what I said about the poor video quality of EDEN AND AFTER ( 1970 ) applies to an even greater extent here – since this one looked distinctly like a tenth-generation dupe ( with actors’ features being quite blurred at times and especially , alas , during the S & M striptease act towards the end ) . That said , the film itself is let down somewhat by sluggish pacing – even if the version I watched ran for a mere 88 minutes , when all sources I know of give its running-time as 105 ! As it is , I’d welcome a legitimate DVD release of TRANS-EUROP-EXPRESS and one hopes that the recent passing of its creator will inspire adventurous labels to pursue its rights .
Morgan - A Suitable Case For Treatment ( Karel Reisz , 1966 )	I've always had something of an ambivalent attitude towards the British " Swinging London " films of the 1960s : sometimes I enjoy their creative technique and anything-goes approach , while other times I find their brashness exasperating and extremely dated . Actually , MORGAN is now among the films I've revisited the most among them ( more by accident than design ) which has led me to toy with the idea of compiling a list of titles from that era - comprising above all films I've watched only once , or not at all , but also those which I haven't checked out in ages ( some of which are in my endless " DVDs To Watch " pile ) . Anyway , the film itself is certainly one of the most engaging of the lot : basically an update of the typical Hollywood ' screwball comedy ' formula , with one member of a divorced couple disrupting the new marriage plans of the other , though here we don't get the conventional happy ending . Reisz was , along with Lindsay Anderson and Tony Richardson , one of the founding members of the " Free Cinema " movement ; though he started at the very top with Saturday NIGHT AND Sunday MORNING ( 1960 ) , the rest of his career was rather spotty with MORGAN being perhaps its closest in quality - even if the unflinching realism of the former had , by this time , given way to irreverent comic fantasy ! While the plot is somewhat thin and the lead character's pranks to reclaim his wife become repetitive , the film's hectic pace never wavers ; stylish , amusing ( particularly when dealing with Morgan's Communist background and his obsession with gorillas ! ) and bolstered by John Dankworth's playful score , it's delightfully enacted by the three principals - David Warner ( the role of his life ) , Vanessa Redgrave ( the recipient of many accolades , including a surprising Best Actress Oscar nomination ) and Robert Stephens - none of whom are typically associated with slapstick ( though David Mercer's script also offers perceptive comments about the painful consequences of a broken marriage ) .
COAL BLACK AND THE SEBBEN DWARFS ( Robert Clampett , 1943 )	This is a notorious Looney Tunes cartoon from celebrated exponent Robert Clampett , one of a handful of ' outrageous ' efforts from The Golden Age Of Animation which were subsequently banned . Of course , as can be gleaned immediately from its altered title , it's a modernized all-black retelling of the Snow White fairy-tale with rampant ( but not really offensive ) racist ? and even sexual ? attitudes that were prevalent during the wartime era . As ever with the classic Warners style of animation , the short moves at breakneck speed ? throwing in a plethora of visual and verbal gags along the way , while being held firmly together by a constant and wholly agreeable jazz soundtrack ( complete with half-sung and rhyming dialogue ) . All in all , however , given its reputation and prolonged suppression , I wouldn't count it among the best or even funniest shorts that Warners produced under the " Looney Tunes / Merrie Melodies " banner .
4 FOR Texas ( Robert Aldrich , 1963 )	Like SERGEANTS 3 ( 1962 ) , the actual running time ( 115 minutes ) of this 1963 Christmas attraction differs from the official one ( 124 minutes ) – although , in this case , it could well be the result of the lopping off of the Prelude , Intermission , Entr’ Acte and Exit Music pieces . While still in essence an overblown and thinly-plotted ego-trip , it’s certainly more entertaining than the Rat Pack’s previous Western outing . Frank Sinatra’s pampered tycoon character is annoyingly narcissistic at times and Anita Ekberg is just there to abet him and as an added scenery attraction ; by contrast , Dean Martin and a sultry Ursula Andress ( a role originally intended for Gina Lollobrigida ! ! ) thoroughly enjoy themselves . Director Aldrich also allows two of his previous collaborators free rein : a constantly burping banker ( Victor Buono ) and Martin’s diminutive bodyguard ( Nick Dennis ) ham it up mercilessly but result in being definite assets to the proceedings ; Charles Bronson is the straight villain and other familiar faces appearing here include Mike Mazurki ( as Sinatra’s own dim-witted bodyguard ) , Richard Jaeckel , Abraham Sofaer , Grady Sutton , etc . The guest appearance by The Three Stooges is cute but hardly outstanding ( though Martin does get to slap all three at once ! ) , emerging as a sure sign of the film’s anything-goes attitude ! Again , Aldrich ( who apparently intensely disliked Sinatra ! ) had tackled Westerns that were both terse and significant before – but , here , he seems to have purposely taken a back seat to the stars’ antics ( albeit with the occasional inventive visual touch ) . By the way , none other than Bette Davis declined a part in the film in order to star in yet another horror piece ( a phase in her career which , coincidentally , Aldrich himself had spearheaded ) – DEAD RINGER ( 1964 ; which I own on DVD but have yet to watch ) – though it’s hard to see now where she would have fitted in . All things considered , the film is a colorful and easy-going romp – culminating in a fistfight between the stars , which is followed by them burying the hatchet in order to rout Bronson ( whose riverboat demise is a highlight ) and Buono , and ending with a double wedding . The Warners DVD contains a short ‘making of " featurette which shows the cast and crew doing their stuff on the set .
I'M COLD ( Tex Avery , 1954 )	This Chilly Willy cartoon was included on Universal's 3-Disc THE WOODY WOODPECKER COLLECTION ; I hadn't yet checked out this set but decided to watch three entries from it regardless , given that they were directed by Tex Avery . The amiable penguin is feeling cold in his igloo and decides to raid a fur warehouse close by ? but , with the place guarded by a smart ( yet laid-back ) bear , it's not going to be an easy task . This may not be one of Avery's best efforts , but the constant gag invention in the central battle-of-wills situation ensures a delightful seven minutes or so .
Carry On Laughing : Short Knight , Long Daze ( TV ) ( Alan Tarrant , 1975 )	This one's a good entry in the alternate " Carry On " series , once again revolving around a medieval theme . Kenneth Connor is an unlikely , pint-sized King Arthur ( he's possibly my favorite actor from the gang and perhaps the most underrated ) , Peter Butterworth is a bumbling Merlin , Joan Sims a flirtatious Guinevere , Jack Douglas ( a late but welcome addition to the " Carry On " team ) is the effeminate Sir Gay ( ! ) , Bernard Bresslaw the imposing knight who's supposed to defend the King's valor but prefers to spend time with the Queen ! A jousting tournament intending to showcase the cowardly Bresslaw's prowess sees Connor and Butterworth ? with the dubious help of Douglas ? cheat by devising a concoction capable of rendering the latter invisible to slay the proposed challengers ; on the day of the event , however , the effect wears off and they have to resort to a different weapon ! Incidentally , that same year , the Monty Python gang ? who started out in TV and then went into features ? made a big-screen ( and obviously superior ) lampoon of Arthurian times with the classic MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL ( 1975 ) .
THE TRIPLETS OF BELLEVILLE ( Sylvain Chomet , 2003 )	This unexpected and highly-acclaimed piece of animation is sufficiently different in style and design to make a good impression but the overall effect is hindered by a dreary plot ( competitors in the Tour De France are being abducted by the underworld and forced to take part in clandestine races ) and some sagging spots in the script . The main characters , especially the resourceful grandmother , her overgrown dog and the frog-eating titular characters themselves , however , more than make up for these flaws ; having said that , the best part of the film are the black-and-white prologue ( featuring the sisters ' bouncy Oscar-nominated number and a clever Fred Astaire caricature ) and the exuberant theater finale capped by a car chase in which our victorious heroes are pursued by a horde of homogeneous henchmen .
THE FLESH AND THE FIENDS { U . K . and Continental Versions } ( John Gilling , 1959 )	Solid , well-crafted but rather patchy cinematic treatment of the saga of notorious 19th Century " Resurrectionists " Burke and Hare and their unorthodox employer Dr . Robert Knox ; in the vein of Hammer horror ( featuring two of their most notable participants in Cushing and Gilling ) though the lack of color makes it seem a half-hearted attempt ( even if , with an eye on the low-budget , it was probably a conscious choice by the film-makers as the intentions were clearly of a serious undertaking ) ! Anyway , the best thing about the film - apart from the vivid recreation of the era - are the performances of Peter Cushing ( as the cold Dr . Knox , not unlike Baron Frankenstein ) , Donald Pleasance ( an impressive early performance as the oily but quick-thinking Hare - his come-uppance is especially eerie ) and Billie Whitelaw ( as the proverbial " tart with a heart of gold " who ends up as one of the victims ) ; Burke is played as a scurrilous but jovial brute ( but who murders with the apparent complicity of his own wife ) by character actor George Rose . Dr . Knox's condescending attitude towards his fellow colleagues also provides a number of entertaining confrontation scenes ( my favorite line is during their face-off at his house , when he brusquely terminates the discussion by instructing them to " incline their heads slightly to the left . . . { in order to } observe the door . . . { and could they } please use it ! " ) ; Cushing , of course , is equally commanding while addressing his lectures or when scrutinizing the newest corpse . The film makes a fine , though essentially unpleasant , companion piece to the more literate and subtle THE BODY SNATCHER ( 1945 ) ; the theme was again handled ( by another horror veteran , Freddie Francis ) a quarter of a century later in THE DOCTOR AND THE DEVILS ( 1985 ) - while Gilling himself had contributed to the script of an earlier variation , THE GREED OF WILLIAM HART ( 1948 ) , starring Tod Slaughter ! By the way , the producing team of Robert S . Baker and Monty Berman ( who doubled as cinematographer ) also brought to the screen the nefarious deeds of other historical figures such as JACK THE RIPPER ( 1959 ) and THE HELLFIRE CLUB ( 1961 ; upcoming on DVD from Dark Sky Films ) . Image's DVD also includes the " Continental Version " which contains about a minute of more explicit violence and nudity ( in the many tavern sequences ) - though this only helps render it even more unsavory than it already is ! The prints are distractingly soft throughout , and the severe widescreen ratio ( 2 . 35 : 1 ) hampers somewhat the viewer's complete involvement ( at least on a normal T . V . screen ) ; the " Continental Version " fares even worse , showing more damage and having rather scratched audio to boot ! Unfortunately , the liner notes by Jonathan Sothcott were not available with my copy : it's probable that the disc was initially released as a snapper-case ( with the essay on the inner sleeve ) but was then dropped when re-issued in the more manageable keep-case !
The Wooden Horse ( Jack Lee and , uncredited , Ian Dalrymple , 1950 )	Excellent P . O . W . adventure , adapted by Eric Williams from his own book ( a paperback copy of which forms part of my father's library ) that was inspired by true events ; it may well be the first film of its kind and , therefore , has a lot to answer for ? not just similarly stiff-upper-lipped examples such as ALBERT , R . N . ( 1953 ; which I'll be watching presently ) , THE COLDITZ STORY ( 1955 ) and DANGER WITHIN ( 1959 ) but higher-profile releases from the other side of the Atlantic , namely STALAG 17 ( 1953 ) and THE GREAT ESCAPE ( 1963 ) . This , then , sets the basis pretty solidly : British soldiers interned in a German camp devise an ingenious plan of escape , borrowing a page from Greek legend ? burrowing from under a vaulting horse used during physical exercise and in full view of their captors ! Actually , the film is neatly split into two halves : the first deals with the slow process of digging the tunnel , culminating in the escape itself , while the latter stages depict their fortunes outside the camp as they try to make it to neutral Sweden . Typically of these British films , the cast showcases several established ( Leo Genn ) , current ( Anthony Steel ) and up-and-coming ( Peter Finch , David Tomlinson and Bill Travers ) stars , to say nothing of innumerable reliable character actors ( Anthony Dawson , Bryan Forbes , Michael Goodliffe and Walter Gotell ) . The three leads / escapees are Genn , Steel and Tomlinson : while the first two stick together , the latter goes his own way ? only to run into the others on reaching safety . As can be expected , the narrative involves plenty of suspense and excitement ; as with most male-centered P . O . W . sagas , too , female interest is kept to the barest minimum . Director Lee didn't have a lengthy career ? with this and the somewhat similar ( albeit with a change of both setting and viewpoint ) A TOWN LIKE ALICE ( 1956 ) his most noteworthy achievements ? but he certainly milked every gripping situation in this case ( even if , reportedly , delays in filming saw Lee quitting his post prematurely ? leaving producer Ian Dalrymple with the task of tying up loose ends ! ) . Anyway , worth special mention is the exquisite lighting ( particularly during night-time sequences ) throughout .
Wake Island ( 1942 )	While nowadays this may seem quite indistinguishable from the many flagwavers rushed into production in its day , at the time WAKE ISLAND was very well received garnering 4 major Academy Award nominations ( Best Film , Best Direction , Best Original Screenplay , Best Supporting Actor - William Bendix ) ; true , the characters and situations are pretty stereotypical but even so , it is certainly well enough made and well-cast ( Brian Donlevy , Macdonald Carey , Albert Dekker , Robert Preston , Walter Abel ) to be remembered when WWII films are discussed . Once the Pearl Harbor attack gets underway , it becomes an engrossing and poignant depiction of men-in-war facing insurmountable odds ; the downbeat ending was quite fresh at the time and seems to have led to a spate of similarly pessimistic WWII movies like BATAAN ( 1943 ) , SAHARA ( 1943 ) , THEY WERE EXPENDABLE ( 1945 ) , etc .
WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS ( Otto Preminger , 1950 )	The director and two stars of LAURA ( 1944 ) were reteamed for this solid policier : Dana Andrews is the son of a criminal who becomes a cop to cut all ties with the past but cannot keep his inherited violent ways in check while interrogating suspects and , one night , he goes too far ; Gene Tierney is the estranged wife of his victim , a decorated war hero who has become involved with the town's leading racketeer and Andrews ' No . 1 nemesis , Gary Merrill ( who had himself been the protégé of Andrews Snr . ) ! As usual with Preminger , this is a well-crafted movie with a notable opening credits sequence and enlivened by a good cast that also includes Karl Malden ( as Andrews ' incumbent superior ) , Tom Tully ( as Tierney's motor-mouth taxi driver dad ) and Neville Brand ( as Merrill's chief thug ) , with notable support also coming from Craig Stevens ( as the slimy , wife-beating victim ) , Bert Freed ( as Andrews ' sympathetic partner ) and Robert F . Nolan ( as Andrews ' stern outgoing superior ) . Having already been warned by the latter to mend his ways or else , Andrews panics and impersonates Stevens for a couple of hours following his murder to put the police on the ( in this case ) wrong tracks of Merrill ; however , after Tully becomes the prime suspect ( by which time Andrews and Tierney are romantically involved ) , the cop goes by himself in Merrill's lair fully intending to get bumped off and ' frame ' the racketeer for his own murder ! Clearly , the protagonist is a complex character and Andrews rises to the challenge with a first-rate characterization that is typically complemented by the in-house Fox noir style .
OLIVER AND COMPANY ( George Scribner , 1988 )	Curiously endearing Disney animated feature inspired by " Oliver Twist " , transposing the Dickensian favorite fairly successfully to a modern-day New York setting - with the villainous Bill Sykes as a mobster ( flanked by a couple of vicious mastiffs ) . Stylistically , it lies somewhere between LADY AND THE TRAMP ( 1955 ) and the adult-oriented films of Ralph Bakshi ( without the sex and violence , naturally ) ; as such , it stands oddly alongside the studio's usual fare from this rather lame era - and its vitality can now be seen to have foreshadowed the renaissance in quality ( and critical appraisal ) which they witnessed soon after , beginning with THE LITTLE MERMAID ( 1989 ) . The anthropomorphic characters ( which generally swamp the humans - Fagin is very much a good guy here , if still pitiful ) are quite nicely fitted to class stereotypes : hence , we get a Hispanic chihauha ( with an eye for the ladies ) and a posh bulldog , among others , while Dodger is basically an updated version of Tramp and Oliver himself a cute but very brave kitten . The familiar and involved plot is all but jettisoned ( especially in its second half ) in favor of boisterous action and character comedy , with a bouncy score and rapid pace to match . In the end , it proved surprisingly good - and , at just 74 minutes , short enough not to overstay its welcome .
CARRY ON ABROAD ( Gerald Thomas , 1972 )	To begin with , I had previously caught a bit from this one on TV while channel-surfing when in London in September 1999 ! Like CARRY ON DOCTOR ( 1967 ) , this is another multi-title offering : CARRY ON ABROAD , OR WHAT A PACKAGE , OR IT'S ALL IN OR , SWISS HOLS IN THE SNOW ! While this is essentially a second-tier " Carry On " , it proved to be consistently enjoyable ? which is why I went for a higher rating than I had myself anticipated ; even so , there are a bit too many gay stereotypes here and it's marred somewhat by the flat TV-style look . Incidentally the hotel shenanigans which take up most of the running-time anticipate the FAWLTY TOWERS ( 1975 ) TV series . By the way , this turned out to be Charles Hawtrey's final " Carry On " ? unfortunately , he doesn't get to do much ? but , then , neither does Kenneth Williams as the tour leader ( he's even given an unconvincing romance with a pretty young colleague ) . On the other hand , Peter Butterworth is at his best as the multi-purpose hotel manager who speaks in broken English ( with Hattie Jacques as his massive and grumpy backwoods wife ) . Among the guests are Sidney James , who's married to Joan Sims but his eyes are constantly on Barbara Windsor ! ; Sims herself draws the attention of gallant but henpecked Kenneth Connor . There are also a number of youngsters thrown into the fray , as well as a manly Scot , and a group of monks ( one of whom , Bernard Bresslaw , is allowed to strike a friendship with one of the girls ? her companion , incidentally , is played by Sally Geeson from Norman Wisdom's WHAT'S GOOD FOR THE GOOSE [ 1969 ] , which I watched recently ) . As I said , many hilarious gags revolve around the run-down condition of the unfinished hotel ? but the scene shifts halfway through to an outing in town ( which turns into a massive scuffle and lands the group in jail ) ; the climactic farewell party , then , sees the hotel ? literally on its last legs ? as it's flooded and crumbling around them . CARRY ON ABROAD ( on which a certain Sun Tan Lo Tion served as technical adviser ) is one of the more satisfying latter-day efforts from the gang ? but , ultimately , it's a notch below classic series titles such as CARRY ON COWBOY ( 1965 ) , CARRY ON SCREAMING ! ( 1966 ) and CARRY ON . . . UP THE KHYBER ( 1968 ) .
HANDS OF THE RIPPER ( Peter Sasdy , 1971 )	This is one of four Peter Sasdy films shown on local TV in the early 1980s when we still owned a black-and-white set and I was too young to be allowed to see them ! Over the years , I managed to catch with three of them : the film under review itself while in London in September 2002 , TASTE THE BLOOD OF Dracula ( 1970 ) fairly recently on DivX and NOTHING BUT THE NIGHT ( 1972 ) just last week on DVD-R ; the only one still eluding me is , reportedly , also the weakest of the bunch , I DON'T WANT TO BE BORN aka MONSTER ( 1975 ) ? This is arguably Sasdy's best work for Hammer and I guess overall , too ; similarly , Eric Porter's excellent performance is very underrated and among the best given in the studio's entire output . The film contains two very well-directed sequences : the slow build-up to the revelation of the first murder and the very last scene featuring the fatal leap off the balcony at the Whispering Corridors . The sleazy MP character ( Derek Godfrey ) and the opportunistic protector / medium ( Dora Bryan ) are two other well-rounded characterizations ; on the other hand , those of Porter's son and blind fiancée ( a wasted Jane Merrow ) are bland and one-dimensional . In spite of its importance in establishing the girl's true identity , the doctor's second visit to a medium could perhaps have been altered to a different profession so that it does not seem reminiscent of the opening séance . Curiously enough , Hammer visited similar Jack The Ripper territory that same year in Roy Ward Baker's DR . JEKYLL AND SISTER HYDE ; besides , while the murder of the proverbial kind-hearted whore is again well-staged , the generally clichéd portrayal of them borders on caricature . The Network SE DVD features an Audio Commentary ( which I've yet to listen to ) and an episode of the 1970s THRILLER TV series featuring HANDS OF THE RIPPER's co-star Angharad Rees whose good and innocent looks are effectively deployed in the blank stare of the entranced protagonist .
SAHARA ( Zoltan Korda , 1943 )	Though largely unsung , this first-rate war actioner is one of the top of its kind and era : following a well-proved formula ( dating back to THE LOST PATROL [ 1934 ] at least ) and , therefore , predictable to a degree - particularly the irony and self-sacrifice that informs some of the characters ' death scenes - the film remains undeniably compelling throughout by virtue of the tight pacing , excellent Oscar-nominated cinematography by Rudolph Mate ' , Miklos Rozsa's fine score and a most capable cast , all of whom deliver good performances in tackling an international set of characters : Humphrey Bogart , Bruce Bennett ( who , incidentally , died recently a centenarian ! ) , Dan Duryea , J . Carroll Naish ( a deserving Oscar nominee ) , Rex Ingram , etc . The film - Bogart's first away from Warners since STAND-IN ( 1937 ) and named after its one-word desert location a ' la the star's recent success , CASABLANCA ( 1942 ) - isn't as heavy on propaganda as other contemporary efforts and , at the time , Bogie's portrayal was hailed as the most realistic depiction of an American soldier ever seen on the screen . Director Korda later followed this with the inferior COUNTER-ATTACK ( 1945 ) , featuring another of Warner Bros . ' biggest stars - Paul Muni .
AGAINST THE WIND ( Charles Crichton , 1948 )	This unusual but typically low-key product from Ealing Studios ( best-known for a series of classic comedies made between 1946-1955 ) is a semi-documentary depiction of the saboteur training undergone by a band of hand-picked civilians and their subsequent missions behind enemy lines ; therefore , in both theme and quality , it anticipates the later , more acclaimed Hollywood offering DECISION BEFORE DAWN ( 1951 ) which , incidentally , I just caught up with a couple of weeks ago . The cast is mostly made up of the usual familiar British faces ( James Robertson Justice , Gordon Jackson , Jack Warner , Robert Beatty , etc . ) but 2 major roles are , very effectively , portrayed respectively by French and Canadian actors : Simone Signoret ( appearing in her first English-speaking film when on the verge of attaining stardom on her home ground ) and Paul Dupuis . Being in this company , there cannot fail to be lighter moments ? especially during an early sequence where our heroes are being shown the tools of their trade i . e . booby-trapped dead rats , manure and even sausages ! ? among the continuous perils and occasional tragedies they have to face away from home ( including being forced to cold-bloodedly execute a compromised companion and swallow the omnipresent suicide pill to escape torture at the enemy's hands ) .
THE ASSASSINATION BUREAU ( Basil Dearden , 1969 )	Typical 1960s big-budget all-star entertainment with an unlikely but intriguing backdrop ( the political turmoil in Europe at the beginning of the 20th century ) and agreeably treated as black comedy . As can be surmised , the titular organization ? headed by Oliver Reed and numbering among its members Telly Savalas , Curt Jurgens , Philippe Noiret , Clive Revill and Kenneth Griffith ? disposes of people it deems criminal but which the law apparently can't reach ? until some of them start to get too big for their boots , while Reed accepts lady journalist Diana Rigg's offer of a contract on himself ! Stylish and colorful ( shot on a variety of stunning European locations and with great care given to sets , costumes and props ) , the film is vastly entertaining along the way ? gleefully poking fun at politics and murder at every turn . Reed and Rigg make a very appealing couple , while Savalas , Jurgens et al have fun sending up their respective images ; of course , Rigg and Savalas would be re-teamed that same year for the James Bond outing ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE . The script , therefore , delivers plenty of suspense and surprise ( including numerous disguises and near-escapes for the hero ) and is capped by a spectacular climax in which a bomb attack via zeppelin ? targeting a castle where all the rulers of Europe have convened for a peace conference ? is thwarted .
TRANCERS ( Charles Band , 1985 )	This sci-fi entry comes across as a charmingly trashy amalgam of BLADE RUNNER ( 1982 ) and THE TERMINATOR ( 1984 ) ? not as good as either , sure , but arguably more entertaining . It involves an unshaven , raincoat-clad police detective from the 23rd century ( the film , in fact , was re-issued as FUTURE COP ) chasing the leader of a group of Trancers ( gullible " squibs " who turn vicious and expire fluorescently in a pile of ashes ) back to the present day , where the latter intends to exterminate the ancestors of the three council members who brought about his downfall . Except for a young Helen Hunt , I was unfamiliar with the main cast ? though craggy-faced lead Tim Thomerson evokes the perfect blend of machismo , world-weariness and bewilderment the role requires . The film is also refreshingly tongue-in-cheek ? with the funniest bits being the hard-boiled hero lighting a match against his own teeth and when , on entering a discotheque frequented by punk rockers , he deadpans " It looks like a room full of Trancers to me " . As a matter of fact , the sharply-written script has a fair amount of amusing one-liners : when Thomerson complains about the implausibility of a name like Peter Gunn upon catching an episode of the vintage series on TV , Hunt quips , " What kind of a name is Jack Deth ? " ( i . e . the character played by Thomerson himself ) . While the special effects afforded by the modest budget could best be described as quaint , the action sequences are adequate enough ? including a couple in which the hero manages to halt time ( via a James Bond-like gadget wrist-watch ) in order to flee the presence of Trancers who have him cornered and , then , to save the heroine from certain death . Though perhaps too low-key for its own good and somewhat under-developed at 76 minutes , the film seems to be deserving of a cult reputation ( for what it's worth , it was followed by two sequels also featuring Thomerson ) ? but , alas , hasn't been served at all well by the DVD format so far ( this viewing came by way of the no-frills fullscreen R2 edition from a budget label ) . I , for one , wouldn't be averse to a more exhaustively packaged and properly framed re-issue . . .
UNTAMED ( Henry King , 1955 )	This is surely one of the Tyrone Power vehicles that's most shown on Italian TV ( in fact , it was re-proposed just last week ) ? but I'd somehow never bothered to watch it . Having had a recording of the film for some time , I now opted to check it out as part of my brief tribute to the popular matinée idol on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of his untimely demise . Well , I must say that I really enjoyed the film for reasons I'll get to later ? which makes its absence on DVD more than a little baffling ; incidentally , it was the tenth of Power's eleven collaborations with director King ( the following effort , THE SUN ALSO RISES [ 1957 ] , is perhaps the one I'd love to watch most of the star's remaining titles ) as well as the second and last in which Power is co-starred with Susan Hayward ( after the excellent suspense Western RAWHIDE [ 1951 ] ) . Anyway , the film is an interesting ( and mainly successful ) mishmash of genres : part offbeat Western ( with a wagon train beset by Zulus rather than Indians ! ) , part epic adventure ( even if the widescreen aspect ratio in the edition I watched wasn't quite the full 2 . 55 : 1 format of its original presentation ) , and part ' woman's picture ' ( despite Power's top billing , he's off-screen for long stretches at a time , so that Hayward emerges as the real protagonist ? given also that she's involved with three men and undergoes many a hardship during the course of the film ) . While the plot is thoroughly predictable ( and , yet , therein lies part of its appeal ) , it's made with the customary professionalism one associates with the golden age of Hollywood ; thus , we're treated to a handsomely-shot large-scale entertainment ? complemented by a fine Franz Waxman score which goes from lush to emphatic or rousing , depending on the mood of any given scene . Among the undeniable highlights in the episodic narrative ( which spans several years ) are : the opening fox hunt in Ireland , which sees hero and heroine alternating between squabbling and loving ; the afore-mentioned ambush of the ' pioneers ' in which Hayward's staid husband John Justin is killed ; Power ( who neglects Hayward through his struggle for the Boers ' independence ) engaging in a whip-wielding duel with his romantic rival and former best friend Richard Egan ( himself lusted after by a young Rita Moreno ) ; Egan having his leg crushed by a tree he's trying to fell ( symbolizing Hayward's affair with Power ) during a thunderstorm ; and the climactic clash between bitter , peg-legged Egan's outlaws and the natives led by the obviously virtuous and rugged Power . The finale , then , has the hero relinquishing ( not without a certain remorse ) his political career to make up to the long-suffering heroine ? especially since their past dalliance had borne him a son ( with whom he also shares his name ) he was unaware of .
HE WALKED BY NIGHT ( Alfred L . Werker and , uncredited , Anthony Mann , 1948 )	One wonders what Werker's contribution to this title is ? as it just feels like a Mann film through and through . with its semi-documentary approach likening it to the latter's T-MEN ( 1947 ) in particular . On its own , the film is said to have served as a virtual template for the DRAGNET TV series ( whose creator , Jack Webb , appears here as a police lab technician ) . Richard Basehart's characterization of the coldly calculating criminal was possibly the most compelling to be depicted on the screen since the time of Fritz Lang's M ( 1931 ) . His resourcefulness and devious nature clearly foreshadowed the more obviously maniacal villains of much later films , such as Scorpio in DIRTY HARRY ( 1971 ; as in that picture , the hero's sidekick eventually ends up in a wheelchair ) and even Hannibal Lecter . Incidentally , the episode of the criminal operating on himself when wounded has since become a cliché ( this was probably the first such instance in cinema ) ? but the numerous shootouts were similarly potent . Also influential is the use of storm drains as both a haven and a conveniently invisible means of travel for the killer ? the most notable example , of course , being THE THIRD MAN ( 1949 ) . Terse and suspenseful , the film is given an added sheen by virtue of John Alton's peerless cinematography ( evident in the MGM DVD I watched , but not the various Public Domain prints in circulation ; see the DVD Beaver comparison for confirmation ) .
Betty Blue : Director's Cut	Again , I've heard a lot about the alleged steaminess of this film and , after finally catching up with it , I certainly am not disappointed in this respect . Sure , there are a few longueurs during the 185 minutes it takes to unfold but how can one complain when its radiant star , Beatrice Dalle whose first film this was , is seen stark naked practically every five minutes ? Dalle is excellent as the alluring Betty , a manic depressive whose volatile relationship with her long-suffering boyfriend Zorg ( Jean-Hugues Anglade ) is put to the ultimate test when she discovers a long-forgotten manuscript penned by him many years ago and convinces him to do whatever it takes to get it published . As the film progresses , however , so does Betty's mental deterioration which involves , among others , child kidnapping ( after a failed pregnancy test ) and self-mutilation . But , even though the film takes a tragic turn in its latter stages , it is nonetheless full of the quirkiness and irony one has come to expect from the maker of DIVA ( 1981 ) . Even Dominique Pinon makes an appearance here as a dopey drug-dealer who gets conned out of his own supply ! Gabriel Yared's melancholic score , then , beautifully captures every nuance of Beineix's emotional , rambling but compelling narrative . When BETTY BLUE was originally released in the U . S . , it was severely cut down to 120 minutes although this did not hinder it from getting nominated for an Academy Award as Best Foreign-Language Film ! Having now watched 3 films from this inventive film-maker - including the charming circus fantasy , ROSELYNE ET LES LIONS ( 1989 ) - I look forward to catching the rest of his filmography , especially LA LUNE DANS LES CANIVEAU ( 1983 ; with Gerard Depardieu and Nastassja Kinski ) , IP5 : L'ILE AUX PACHYDERMES ( 1992 ; which was Yves Montand's last film ) and MORTEL TRANSFERT ( 2001 ; again with Jean-Hugues Anglade ) .
MARY , QUEEN OF SCOTS ( Charles Jarrott , 1971 )	A follow-up to the prestigious historical epic ANNE OF THE THOUSAND DAYS ( 1969 ) which reunites several crew members ( producer Hal Wallis , director Jarrott , screenwriter John Hale , costume designer Margaret Furse , etc . ) and resumes the bloody Tudor saga . The same events had been previously filmed in Hollywood by John Ford as MARY OF Scotland ( 1936 ) with Katharine Hepburn ( as Mary Stuart ) , Fredric March ( as Bothwell ) and his real-life actress wife Florence Eldridge ( as Queen Elizabeth I ) ; here these same roles are played by Vanessa Redgrave ? who had already appeared ( as Elizabeth's mother , Anne Boleyn ) in the magnificent A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS ( 1966 ) , Nigel Davenport ( ditto ) and Glenda Jackson ( who was currently starring as the same English monarch on British TV ) and , like its above-mentioned predecessor ( albeit to a lesser extent ) , the film found favor at awards ceremonies of the day with both Redgrave and Jackson being up for Oscar ( the former ) and Golden Globes ( both ) . Also singled out was composer John Barry for his beautiful score , the somewhat disjointed script and , inevitably , the lavish costumes and sets . Still , where the film impresses most is in the performances of the ensemble cast : apart from those already pointed out , we also have Patrick McGoohan ( who just died at 80 as Mary's devious half-brother James ) , Trevor Howard ( as the English Queen's wily chief adviser ) , Timothy Dalton ( as Mary's second and tyrannical husband ) , Daniel Massey ( as Elizabeth's ambitious lover ) , Ian Holm ( as Mary's link to the Vatican ) and Andrew Keir ( as a Scottish lord ) . As befits the time in which it was made , I suppose , side by side with the classiness on display , we have to contend with tastelessly ' accurate ' portrayals of everybody's bed-hopping and histrionic antics ? from a red-headed Dalton's seduction of minstrel man-spy Holm to Redgrave's elopement with newly-married lord Davenport to Jackson's long-term and tempestuous relationship with the equally married Massey . For the record , I have a handful of other films dealing with the Tudors on my " To Watch " list but I decided to get to this sooner rather than later in view of McGoohan's passing .
Viva Maria ! ( 1965 )	This vastly enjoyable romp features Brigitte Bardot and Jeanne Moreau at their loveliest as two saloon entertainers who ( inadvertently ) not only find themselves in the middle of the Mexican Revolution , but also invent striptease in the process ! VIVA MARIA ! sees Louis Malle return to the " anything goes " territory of his earlier success , ZAZIE DANS LE METRO ( 1960 ) ; here he is aided immeasurably by an engaging cast ( which also includes Luis Bunuel regular , Claudio Brook and an understandably daunted George Hamilton ! ) and an impeccable crew ( co-screenwriter Jean-Claude Carriere , cinematographer Henri Decae , composer Georges Delerue , assistant directors Juan Bunuel and Volker Schlondorff ) ! While the film is uneven in spots , the last half hour is a succession of hilarious sight gags which border at times , perhaps unsurprisingly given its credentials , on the surreal and the anti-clerical .
ROCKY BALBOA ( Sylvester Stallone , 2006 )	The sixth ROCKY entry comes tiptoeing out of retirement after a 16-year hiatus and , against all expectations , practically revitalizes the initially highly-successful but subsequently maligned franchise . Sylvester Stallone takes complete control once again by starring in , writing , directing and serving as executive producer of this flawed but well-crafted and solidly entertaining audience-pleaser . I say flawed because of several ( mostly plot-related ) factors : firstly , Stallone is 60 years old and while not especially looking it , his physique has taken an undeniably flabby appearance ( particularly the face ) which does not exactly lend credence to the fact that the Boxing Commission eventually permits him to ply his past trade once more ; the brain damage implications which arose in ROCKY V ( 1990 ) are completely omitted here ; Rocky is now a widower and , although we see him sitting by his wife's grave several times throughout the film , Stallone could not resist giving in to convention and minority groups by introducing an unlikely - and saccharine - love interest in the figure of an old acquaintance ( Geraldine Hughes ) and her half-Jamaican son ; his ringside opponent here ( Antonio Tarver ) , while still colored as had been Rocky's most formidable nemesis Apollo Creed , sports none of Carl Weathers ' charisma or panache ( which made one care for the character if not exactly cheer for him ) , even if this could constitute a sarcastic jab by Stallone at today's utterly colorless { sic } celebrities in most entertainment spectrums . Even so , the film has other assets in Stallone's own determined , even moving performance , the presence of the grouchy ( but always welcome ) Burt Young and , most surprisingly , a well-written , perceptive script which highlights not only the plight of an ex-World Champion prize-fighter in today's disrespectful age dominated by computers and the search for increase of wealth over the old-fashioned values of dignity and pride but also , in the film's emotional highlight , the strained father-son relationship which arises when the younger generation has to regretfully live under the old one's ( however pale ) shadow . One cannot review a ROCKY film without mentioning the climactic boxing match and the one we have here , while understandably ( and judiciously ) more muted than the ones we had in the first four entries in the series , is still quite satisfying and invigorating . All in all , while I can't really join in the " Oscar buzz " chorus which was bandied about by a few here , Stallone would surely be in the running had there been an Academy Award for Best Comeback of the Year .
EDMOND ( Stuart Gordon , 2005 )	Playing like a more philosophical version of FALLING DOWN ( 1993 ) but done on a more intimate scale , this character drama resolves itself into a series of interesting vignettes where a good cast is allowed to leave its mark : David Mamet ( who wrote the script , based on his own play ) regular Joe Mantegna and a surprising amount of female roles ( including , as is his fashion , one for Mamet's wife Rebecca Pidgeon ) - with the most impressive , perhaps , being Mena Suvari ( as a high-class hooker ) and Julia Stiles ( as an aspiring actress doubling as a waitress ) . But , of course , it's William H . Macy's show all the way and he delivers a terrific performance - vulnerable and generally perplexed , yet capable of incredible and unexpected violent outbursts ( even the subway scene , in which he verbally lashes out at a black woman who is unwilling to engage in a conversation with him , is priceless ) . Mamet deals with Fate and how it shapes someone's future in spite of oneself - as the motif of number 115 proves ; still , the film's suggestion that Macy's character ultimately finds contentedness behind bars as a homosexual is baffling and somewhat alienating ! All things considered , however , a good film - surprisingly but well handled by gore-meister Gordon - focused on telling its story vividly ( the sleazy L . A . nightlife , which I saw a bit of while in Hollywood late last year { ! } , providing an overpowering backdrop ) , concisely and , occasionally , with great power . The jazzy score is quite nice , too .
ALVAREZ KELLY ( Edward Dmytryk , 1966 )	This is another film I decided to re-acquaint myself with in order to pay a well-deserved tribute to the late , great Richard Widmark . It’s one of the last Westerns he did and , in fact , it came at a time when the old-style Hollywood approach to the genre was coming to an end ; actually , Widmark’s co-star from ALVAREZ KELLY – William Holden ( here playing the title character ) – would only a few years later feature in the film that gave the Western new-fangled maturity and an equally potent elegiac tone i . e . Sam Peckinpah’s THE WILD BUNCH ( 1969 ) ! Anyway , to get back to the matter at hand , ALVAREZ KELLY seems to me to be unjustly neglected when it comes to discussing large-scale Westerns of the era . It may be because there is little action per se – though the climactic skirmish / chase ( culminating in the blowing-up of a bridge : let’s not forget that Holden was one of the leads in two big-budget , star-studded war adventures , namely THE BRIDGES AT TOKO-RI [ 1954 ] and THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI [ 1957 ] ) is exciting enough – or the fact that the plot is atypical ( inspired by a true incident in which a herd of cattle , sold to the Yanks by neutral Holden during the American Civil War , is stolen en masse from under their very noses by the opposing Confederate side , led by Widmark and who has abducted Holden to this end ! ) . With respect to this curious narrative , the film opens with a nice animated sequence depicting the importance of securing food at a time of war throughout the ages . The two stars’ respective parts have been tailor-made for their established screen personas . Holden is cynical , opportunistic and charming ( ironically , I’ve just recalled that I used these exact same words to describe Widmark’s younger character in GARDEN OF EVIL [ 1954 ] ! ) . Widmark , on the other hand , is here a tough army man whose commitment to the Southern cause makes him ruthless above all else – alienating him from fiancée Janice Rule , and even considering drowning the entire herd in a swamp if it’s to fall back into the hands of the Yanks ; sensing his unreasonable outlook early on , Holden quips : " God save me from dedicated men " ! They’re at their best in a couple of major confrontation scenes : the first in which a one-eyed Widmark shoots off one of Holden’s fingers ( while the latter is in prison ) because of his lack of co-operation , and when Holden coolly explains to an aghast – and subsequently furious – Widmark that the clandestine passage he arranged for ( on a steamboat which has just sailed ) was not for himself but rather the disenchanted Rule ! Predictably , but believably , the two men’s relationship ends in mutual respect – with Widmark even saving Holden’s life towards the end . The supporting cast is led by the afore-mentioned Rule , who does quite well by her Southern belle role ( another lady – played by Victoria Shaw – proves more responsive and loyal to Widmark’s exploits ) , and Patrick O’Neal in the part of the Unionist Major who negotiated the initial deal with Holden , is having a hard time convincing his superiors of the enemy’s incredible plan , and who can’t fathom how the black slaves are unwilling to emancipate themselves ( but rather shield those who want to keep them under their thumb ! ) . By the way , surely one of the film’s main assets is John Green’s cheerful and memorable score ( complete with a hackneyed yet agreeable title tune sung by The Brothers Four , an obscure folk group which seems to have remained active to this day ) . This unusual Western , then , is more than just a pleasant diversion ( an epithet by which it’s often dismissed ) : good-looking , engaging , and certainly never boring – despite a not inconsiderable length of 110 minutes ( though it’s listed officially on most sources at my disposal as being 116 ! ) .
The Career Of A Chambermaid ( Dino Risi , 1976 )	This homage to Italy’s " White Telephone " films ( sophisticated comedy-dramas revolving around working-class girls ) of the 1930s gives Agostina Belli her best role – going from chambermaid to prostitute to singer to film-star to mistress of ‘Il Duce’ ! – for which she received a special David Di Donatello award , the Italian equivalent of the Oscar . Incidentally , the English title evokes memories of Octave Mirbeau’s ‘scandalous’ novel " Diary Of A Chambermaid " – thrice brought to the screen ( in Hollywood in 1946 by Frenchman Jean Renoir , in France in 1964 by Spaniard Luis Bunuel and in 1974 , typically as a sexploitationer , by prolific " Euro-Cult " exponent Jess Franco : the latter being the only one I haven’t watched and don’t own in any form ) . At other points in the narrative , the film also reminded me of A STAR IS BORN ( itself filmed several times ) and BELLE DE JOUR ( 1967 ) , Bunuel’s celebrated classy treatment of prostitution . . . The rest of the cast here is interesting : Cochi Ponzoni is Belli’s unlucky boyfriend , sent to various war-fronts but always turning up to curse and / or embarrass the heroine ; Vittorio Gassman as an ageing matinée idol of the silver screen whose speech impediment forces him to be dubbed ( a character inspired perhaps by John Gilbert ) ; Renato Pozzetto is a Fascist who lands Belli into a bordello run by is own mother ! ; Lino Toffolo is a musician she meets at the whorehouse with a peculiar idiosyncrasy which sees him dressed in a baby outfit and asking Belli to bottle-feed him ! ; Alvaro Vitali ( future protagonist of the low-brow " Pierino " sex-comedy series ) is also taken to the joint – by his own father , who’s blissfully unaware of the boy’s homosexual tendencies ; and Ugo Tognazzi as a hunchbacked scavenger whose specialty is turning over Jews to the Fascists ! Its meticulous recreation ( especially the Venice locations , which include the Palazzo del Cinema , as well as the Excelsior Hotel my brother and I visited a number of times – clandestinely , I hasten to add – in September 2004 ! ) makes for a good-looking movie further blessed with a typically nice Armando Trovajoli score . However , despite its generally comic tone , the film is also effective as an expose ' of Fascism : at its most outrageous when Gassman plays a prank on his industrialist guests by faking a news flash in which it’s stated that the Government will be taking over all private enterprises – only to have one of them asking to be excused and proceeds to shoot himself in the next room ! ; Gassman’s own fortunes are dissipated with a spell in a private clinic ( due to substance abuse ) , and he turns up to Belli’s chagrin during a party inaugurating the coalition of German and Italian Fascists ; his own demise is poignant as , while playing a Fascist in a comeback role , he is mistaken for the genuine article by a band of partisans – they play at executing him via firing squad , but he actually expires out of sheer fright ! Finally , I should point out that the picture features a remarkably profane script which renders it particularly hilarious to those fluent in the language ( and are of the Catholic faith to boot ) !
DEATH SENTENCE ( Mario Lanfranchi , 1968 )	Like THE PRICE OF POWER ( 1969 ) , which I watched a couple of years back , I’ve found this to be a hidden Spaghetti Western gem of which I was completely unaware until just a few days prior to purchasing on R2 DVD ! Though , ultimately , not quite as weird as DJANGO , KILL . . . IF YOU LIVE , SHOOT ! ( 1967 ) , as arty as MATALO ! ( 1970 ) , or as extreme as CUT-THROATS NINE ( 1972 ) – which seemed to be the case judging by the few online reviews that I came across in the interim – the film is certainly one of the most unusually-styled outings in this most prolific of " Euro-Cult " genres . With its frequent use of ellipses ( notably a shock cut to the mangled body of a young woman ) and even audaciously moving away from crucial moments ( for instance , in the course of a duel ) , the choice I made to blind-buy DEATH SENTENCE proved to be entirely justified . The revenge plot is actually quite typical , though reminiscent – in particular – of DEATH RIDES A HORSE ( 1967 ) : even the curiously milksop hero ( played by the anonymous Robin Clarke and , thus , making for a good contrast with his famous adversaries ) looks more than a bit like John Philip Law from that film ! Given its episodic structure , the formidable quartet of villains are introduced one by one : Richard Conte ( the most sympathetic of the lot as an aging farmer aspiring for stability – even if it’s coming via the proceeds from a robbery which ends in cold-blooded murder ! ) , Enrico Maria Salerno ( as a compulsive gambler who likes to humiliate his opponents – but , obviously , finds his match in Clarke ) , Adolfo Celi ( whose unscrupulous gang boss-cum-fanatical preacher may well have influenced Samuel L . Jackson’s character in Quentin Tarantino’s PULP FICTION ( 1994 ) – incidentally , he’s ingeniously dispatched by way of an ostensibly empty gun which actually contains an extracted bullet that had previously been lodged in Clarke’s own thigh ! ) and Tomas Milian ( an especially memorable role for him as an epileptic albino with a taste for anything golden , be it money or women – his inherently campy qualities here anticipated some of the star’s outlandish later roles in various poliziotteschi ! ) . Though not figuring prominently in the narrative , the three attractive female presences of the film are nonetheless given reasonable characterizations – enough to provide the whole with some much-needed humanity , serving as respite from the general bleakness and dominant feeling of machismo . Characteristic of the Spaghetti Western genre , one of the undeniable assets of DEATH SENTENCE lies in the excellent score by " Euro-Cult " stalwart Gianni Ferrio ( highlighted by an especially haunting theme tune ) . Mario Lanfranchi was a distinguished stage director who worked only fitfully for the cinema ; an opera enthusiast , he brought a number of these to the screen – but , apart from the film under review , he also made such genre efforts as the erotic drama IL BACIO ( 1974 ) and the poliziottesco MERCILESS MAN ( 1977 ) . In the amusingly theatrical interview included on the Koch Media DVD , he comes across as something of a self-promoter but remains nonetheless a most affable host throughout ( and remarkably fluent in English ) . He mentions a number of interesting anecdotes pertaining to the shooting of the film : the fact that Milian bore him a grudge because he considered Lanfranchi too intellectual ; Salerno would only work for a specified number of hours each day and often left the set in mid-sequence ( ! ) ; Lanfranchi felt that the presence on set of Clarke’s current girlfriend ( Ali MacGraw ) was proving an intrusion , so he had her fly back home to New York unbeknownst to Clarke – the actor’s subsequent fury at this affront came through in his performance , thus effectively achieving just what the director wanted for the character ! ; the writer / director also hilariously mentions a surreal incident involving a cow that took place at composer Ferrio’s house , and which seems to come straight out of Luis Bunuel’s L’AGE D’OR ( 1930 ) ! After viewing this delightful and informative reminiscence ( lasting nearly half-an-hour ) , I look forward now to listening to Lanfranchi’s Audio Commentary . One final note : the DVD , unfortunately , was plagued with a couple of playback glitches – freezing at the disc’s layer change and occasional audio dropouts during the interview ; these were quite glaring on my Pioneer model but , thankfully , proved less conspicuous when I tried the DVD on my other ( cheaper ) brand of player !
THE RETURN OF Dracula ( Paul Landres , 1958 )	I had always been interested in this one due to a couple of stills from its climax ( thus spoiling Dracula's come-uppance for me all those many years ago ! ? in retrospect , his eventual demise is beautifully set up early on in the cave sequence with the stranded kitten ) and the carping about its unavailability on DVD by fans ? particularly from one HTF member ( you know who you are ) . This is clearly a low-budget horror effort , but rather splendid overall : well-handled , commendably fast-paced , and with effective genre trappings ( special effects depicting mist , Dracula's lack of reflection in a mirror , and his reverting to a skeleton at the end ) and a nice , typically American small-town atmosphere . Francis Lederer is commanding as the Count , at once sinister and magnetic ? even if his demeanor throughout seems merely to alternate between arrogance and contempt ( unexpectedly , he changes into a wolf dog for one attack ) ! ; I had previously been impressed by the actor when he played the ambitious and malevolent manservant in Jean Renoir's THE DIARY OF A CHAMBERMAID ( 1946 ) . Being a film from the late 1950s , it comes as no surprise to find that the heroes are a teenage couple : still , Dracula's interest in the girl is understandable and creates some compelling tension ? she is just as stuck on him in her own way , since he's posing as a visiting uncle from a far-away country with a sophisticated / artistic bent ! ? in a relationship that's comparable to the one between Joseph Cotten and Teresa Wright in Alfred Hitchcock's favorite among his own films , SHADOW OF A DOUBT ( 1943 ) . However , this also means that the young couple are the ones to dispatch Lederer ? rather than the vampire hunter who followed him all the way from his homeland ! The latter gets saddled with the next best thing , though ? the staking of the Count's blind ( ! ) vampire bride , which employs a striking color insert as the blood starts spurting from her wound ( incidentally , the woman's hysterical first death scene also constitutes one of the film's highlights ) . By the way , the religious overtones in the script are rather unusual for the time ? with Dracula offering the heroine the opportunity to " be reborn in me " ! The film has other interesting credentials to its name : independent producers Arthur Gardner and Jules V . Levy , composer Gerald Fried ( PATHS OF GLORY [ 1957 ] ? even if the soundtrack makes particularly inspired use throughout of the brooding medieval hymn " Dies Irae " ) , cinematographer Jack MacKenzie ( ISLE OF THE DEAD [ 1945 ] ) and assistant director Bernard McEveety ( THE BROTHERHOOD OF Satan [ 1971 ] ) . Incidentally , the silly British title given to the film ? THE FANTASTIC DISAPPEARING MAN ? makes the whole sound like a Harry Houdini biopic ( ! ) . . . though the change is certainly understandable , in view of its potentially being mistaken for a follow-up to the current Hammer remake of Dracula ( 1958 ) . Disappointingly , no extras at all are included on the MGM / Fox DVD ; still , THE RETURN OF Dracula has been ideally paired with the same film-makers ' previous ( and even more radical ) bloodsucking effort ? called , simply , THE VAMPIRE ( 1957 ) .
CEMETERY WITHOUT CROSSES ( Robert Hossein , 1969 )	The qualities inherent in this Spaghetti Western have more to do with its uniqueness rather than for any outstanding merit : the film , in fact , is a French-Italian co-production ( albeit co-scripted by none other than Dario Argento ! ) . Also unusual is the fact that the movie was helmed by its own leading man ? incidentally , the two stars ( Hossein and Michele Mercier ) had just finished the 5-picture " Angelique " series , which is currently being re-proposed on Italian TV ( I've recorded four of them so far but have yet to watch any ) . Of the remaining cast members , I was mainly familiar with Michel Lemoine ( perhaps best-known for playing the Mephistophelean figure in Jess Franco's SUCCUBUS [ 1967 ] and who would himself graduate to direction with the likes of SEVEN WOMEN FOR Satan [ 1974 ] ) ; though his character isn't given any distinguishing features , the actor's odd looks are enough to give an offbeat tone to the traditional Western garb and settings . The plot ? a running feud between two factions , with each of whom the laid-back and detached ex-gunfighter Hossein becomes involved ? is quite typical and straightforward ; actually , the hero had been Mercier's flame but the latter eventually married another man , who turned out to be no good ? though she's determined that the perpetrators of his death be punished , which is why she now turns once more to Hossein ( living a hermitic existence in a nearby ghost town ! ) . In direct opposition to the " Angelique " films mentioned above ? where the sensuality of Mercier , one of the loveliest starlets of her time , was given center-stage ? here , she deliberately chose to be deglamorized ( not only forced to bury her husband all by herself but being physically manhandled by the villains at the end ) . Anyway , Hossein joins the other side ? ostensibly as a rustler ? but subsequently kidnaps the patriarch's daughter for purposes of ransom ; on the other hand , they retaliate by beating up the two brothers ( Lemoine among them ) of Mercier's husband . By the time it's all over , unsurprisingly , there are bodies lying everywhere ? even the stars get it ( with Hossein giving himself a particularly ironic demise ) ! Much of what's admirable in the genre at its best is evident here as well : laconic dialogue , good action ( ominously donning a glove before engaging in shoot-outs , Hossein's gunplay is so quick as to border on the invisible ! ) , terrific score ( by the director's father Andre ' ! ) and an evocatively grubby look ( the opening and closing moments , then , are given an added dimension by being presented in sepia ) ; interestingly , Hossein dedicated the film to his friend ( and undisputed master of the genre ) Sergio Leone !
ILLEGAL ( Lewis Allen , 1955 )	Due to his brush with HUAC , Edward G . Robinson's career suffered throughout the 1950s ; I hadn't watched that much of his work from this period myself ? but have now managed to catch two ( coincidentally , both semi-noirs made for the same director ) in one day . Though actually the second one , this was the superior effort : in fact , I found it to be quite an underrated genre outing ? whose courtroom milieu supplies an added treat ; for the record , it was the third screen version of a popular play of the 1920s ( the others were THE MOUTHPIECE [ 1932 ] , the best-regarded one , and THE MAN WHO TALKED TOO MUCH [ 1940 ] ) . Robinson is perfectly in his element here as a crusading D . A . who hits the skids after he sends an innocent man ( STAR TREK's DeForrest Kelley ! ) to the electric chair ? trying to pick up the pieces as a common civil lawyer , he falls in with a powerful gangster but is ultimately redeemed ( in both senses of the word ) . At this point , the actor must have relished such a meaty part ? particularly one that so vividly recalled some of his earlier vintage work ( but most of all BULLETS OR BALLOTS [ 1936 ] , a Robinson vehicle I watched for the first time only recently and greatly enjoyed , and which also sees him playing on either side of the law ) . The play was here adapted for the screen by two notable scriptwriters , W . R . Burnett ( author of LITTLE CAESAR [ 1930 ] , which had made the star's name in the first place ) and James R . Webb . The supporting cast is also well chosen : Nina Foch as Robinson's diligent assistant and surrogate daughter , who stays on with the D . A . ' s office once the hero is disgraced ; Hugh Marlowe as another Robinson aide who loves and subsequently marries Foch ; Ellen Corby , one more member of Robinson's staff but who devotedly sticks with her boss ; Albert Dekker as the gangster figure ; and a debuting Jayne Mansfield as Dekker's ' talented ' moll ( her role reminded me of Marilyn Monroe's celebrated bit in THE ASPHALT JUNGLE [ 1950 ] , coincidentally drawn from another popular W . R . Burnett novel ) . Eventually , the mole in the D . A . ' s office ? suspected to be Foch due to her ties with Robinson ? is discovered to be Marlowe who , when confronted by Foch , she ends up killing him in self-defense ; Robinson defies his boss by taking up her case ( protecting himself by secreting evidence that would point the finger at Dekker in the event that something happens to him ) . Though the film is an atypical noir and contains just one action sequence , Robinson's unconventional courtroom tactics are at least as entertaining and arresting : knocking out a burly witness to a brawl so as to prove his unreliability ; drinking a dose of slow-acting poison himself in order to smash the new D . A . ' s case against his client ( an associate of Dekker's ) ; at the end turning up in court mortally wounded to acquit Foch . By the way , a handful of paintings from Robinson's personal renowned art collection are passed off as Dekker's in the film ! Warners ' exemplary DVD ? issued as a double-feature , as part of their " Film Noir Collection Vol . 4 " , with Don Siegel's even better THE BIG STEAL ( 1949 ) featuring the great team of Robert Mitchum and Jane Greer ? contains the trailer , an Audio Commentary ( an extra I used to lap up in the past but haven't listened to one in a long time ? chiefly due to time constraints and a huge backlog of films ! ) as well as two featurettes . One discusses the film proper ( all-too briefly ) and the other a vintage TV piece in black-and-white , hosted by the ubiquitous Gig Young , about courtroomers produced by Warners ( with clips from the Oscar-winning THE LIFE OF EMILE ZOLA [ 1937 ] and two ' brand-new ' efforts ? Otto Preminger's THE COURT-MARTIAL OF BILLY MITCHELL [ 1955 ] , which I haven't watched , and , of course , ILLEGAL itself with even a brief contribution from Edward G . Robinson ) .
The Curse Of The Were-Rabbit ( 2005 )	I hadn't watched CHICKEN RUN ( 2001 ) or the " Wallace & Gromit " TV series , so I didn't quite know how I would take this feature-length effort ; I must say that I was very surprised with the results . The film was a delight : very funny , clever and with any number of wonderful sight gags that ought to shame the makers of what passes for comedy nowadays ! Wallace and Gromit turned out to be a very likable pair after all , as were the " villainous " dog and the flock of bunnies who , obviously , play a pivotal role in the proceedings . Besides , its take on werewolf films is quite nicely done . The form of clay animation adopted here is somewhat crude ( when compared to the standard Disney style ) . . . but I vastly prefer it to CGI !
The Working Class Goes To Heaven ( Elio Petri , 1971 )	The Spirit of Social Justice of the May ' 68 uprisings is still very much alive in this heavy-going but compelling parable of the rise and fall in the fortunes of an Italian factory worker dubbed Lulu ( Gian Maria Volonte ' ) : starting out as the Boss ' darling for being the exemplary employee and pacesetter of the company , the loathing of his co-workers ( who despise him for how his excessive zeal makes their own lackluster performance look bad in the eyes of the manager ) and his female companion Mariangela Melato ( who never gets any piece of the action at night because of his constant fatigue ) eventually gets to him one day ? with the result that he loses his concentration at work and suffers the loss of a finger in an accident . This changes his whole outlook on life as he becomes engrossed in an extremist workers ' union , finally makes love in his car to a virginal female co-worker / union member he is obsessed with , is quitted by his consumerist hairdresser companion and his surrogate son and , when he is given the sack at work and is on the point of selling off his belongings , another more moderate workers ' union comes to his aid by winning him his old job back . Although there is obviously much footage here of socio-political discussions , scenes of picketing and police riots , confrontations between diverse unions , etc . , the film also has that winning whimsical streak promised by its title and exemplified by amusing episodes in a mental institution ( where Volonte ' visits his cracked-up ex-colleague Salvo Randone ) , the quasi-surreal sequence of Volonte ' taking it out on all his useless possessions ( including a giant inflatable doll of Scrooge McDuck ! ) , and the concluding description at the assembly line of the titular incident itself which Volonte ' had in a dream the previous night . Ennio Morricone's inventively ' metallic ' music underscores the robotic gestures of the factory workers who , despite slaving eight hours a day at their machines , are not even aware what becomes of the parts they produce ! While the film may seem overdone and dated in today's apathetic age , it clearly hit a nerve at the time of its release winning a handful of international awards including the Palme D'Or at the Cannes Film Festival .
CONFLAGRATION ( Kon Ichikawa , 1958 )	Director Ichikawa passed away in mid-February ; having no unwatched films of his in my collection , I decided to pay him tribute with this ( which I only recently acquired and was , reportedly , his own personal favorite among his films ) and the anti-war drama THE BURMESE HARP ( 1956 ; via the Criterion DVD ) ? both of which are among his most renowned works . I had attended part of an Ichikawa retrospective at London's National Film Theater in 2002 , where I watched eight of his movies ? comprising both well-known and more obscure titles ; incidentally , I first watched CONFLAGRATION itself in a specialized local theater during a 2005 Japanese-film week ? along with Akira Kurosawa's minor SCANDAL ( 1950 ) . By the way , the lead actor here is also called Ichikawa ? and , funnily enough , he plays a character named Mizoguchi ( one wonders whether it was a deliberate nod to famed Japanese film-maker Kenji Mizoguchi , who had died two years before and also happens to be the Asian exponent I admire above all myself ! ) ; Tatsuya Nakadai , then , provides solid support as an opportunistic cripple ? he was a star in the making at this point . While the subject matter ( based on a story by the celebrated but controversial Yukio Mishima ) ? involving a meek and stuttering monk's schooling and who has an unlimited devotion to a Japanese temple , may not be exactly enticing ? there's no denying the emotional power inherent in the unfolding drama , or the beauty of the images themselves ( the film was shot in monochrome and widescreen ) . Besides , the director utilizes a simple and seamless transition between present and past events in the boy's life ; incidentally , the story is told in flashback as the young monk is being interrogated by the baffled and angry police for having willfully destroyed a national shrine ( he eventually burns down his beloved temple in a symbolic gesture when subjected to the hypocrisies of the world ) . Aside from the exploits of rebellious buddy Nakadai , the hero's religious doubt is triggered by the fact that his otherwise firm superior turns out to be a womanizer , and that his outwardly submissive yet overbearing mother is also an adulteress ? while in his own eagerness not to have the temple defiled by ' unworthy subjects ' , he mistreats a local girl who wants to take refuge inside ? thus effectively solving her dilemma , since she miscarries the baby due from an illicit affair with a American G . I . ( the time in which the narrative is set , presumably , being the immediate post-war era ) .
Warning Shadows - A Nocturnal Hallucination ( Arthur Robison , 1923 )	This had been something of a holy grail for me : while there's very little that's actually written about it ( even following this DVD release from Kino - I came across only 1 online review ! ) , its reputation as a highpoint of the German Expressionist movement had always preceded it and I had personally been intrigued for years by a single still from the film in the British periodical from the early 80s , " The Movie " . Well , having at long last watched the film ( thanks , Kino , also the ' rescuers ' of another rare Silent classic - Paul Leni's THE MAN WHO LAUGHS [ 1928 ] ) , I can say that it's a genuine masterwork which well and truly belongs with the other classics of the early German cinema ( particularly the Expressionist horror films , even if WARNING SHADOWS is not a genre effort per se ) . Still , there are undeniable macabre overtones in the story about a dinner party comprising a jealous man , his flirtatious wife and her four suitors that's ' invaded ' by the owner of a traveling puppet-show who may or may not be a magician as well . Actually , the film looks forward to several others in its theme and approach : first of all , its complete lack of intertitles ( this is a purely visual film ) precedes F . W . Murnau's more celebrated THE LAST LAUGH ( 1924 ) , the silhouetted puppet show anticipates Lotte Reiniger's THE ADVENTURES OF PRINCE ACHMED ( 1926 ; the first ' animated ' film ) and the ' film-within-a-film ' scenario ( where we have the magician ' borrowing ' the shadows of the guests in order to allow them to see for themselves what is to be the tragic outcome of the night ) also looks forward to a similar ' morality play ' performance at the centre of another Murnau film , TARTUFFE ( 1925 ) ! As I said , the film's look - sets by Albin Grau and camera-work by Fritz Arno Wagner ( both of whom had worked on Murnau's NOSFERATU [ 1922 ] ) - and the techniques deployed - particular attention is given to the lighting scheme as , in the absence of dialogue , this functions as much as an illumination of the various characters and what they may be thinking as the actors interpreting them ! - are incredible ( even after all these years ) : the plot itself is very simple and , in fact , if the film has a fault it's that it takes this a bit too slowly ; all the various characters are introduced at the very start in a prologue which occupies the first five minutes of the picture ! Then again , by the time the magician's terrifying and murderous visions had reached their crescendo ( this here is , by far , the best section of the film ) , I had become so completely absorbed that I was actually surprised when the picture shifted back to the main narrative , indicating that it was nearing conclusion ! As befits an Expressionist film , the acting style ( but also the make-up ) is slightly exaggerated with the result that some of it may seem awkward today ( the leading lady and the three elderly suitors , for instance ) . Much better are the three more notable names in the cast - Fritz Kortner as the husband , Gustav von Wangeheim ( who had been Jonathan Harker in NOSFERATU ) as the infatuated youth and especially Alexander Granach ( yet another NOSFERATU alumnus , where he had made a creepy Renfield ) as the scruffy-looking and somewhat unhinged magician ; indeed , the latter makes for a truly memorable character - and I could just imagine him going to the next house or the next village after the end of our story to provide some more of his specialized ' entertainment ' ! The figure of director Arthur Robison , then , is something of an enigma : he was an American who ended up working in Germany ; I haven't seen any of his other work and doubt how much of it actually survives at this juncture - but he did contrive to make the original version of THE INFORMER ( featuring , apart from a very young Ray Milland , German actors Lars Hanson and Lya De Putti ! ) in Britain in 1929 , while in 1935 came his remake of the oft-filmed German folktale THE STUDENT OF PRAGUE , starring the great Anton Walbrook in the famous dual role . . .
Pickpocket ( 1959 )	" PICKPOCKET is Bresson's first film . Those he made beforehand were nothing but rough drafts . In fact , for those who appreciate the merits of this film-maker , the opening of PICKPOCKET is one of the four or five great dates in the history of the cinema . " These wildly enthusiastic ( if not a little hyperbolic ) comments , written by fellow film director Louis Malle at the time of its original release , seem to belie critic Richard Roud's assertion that PICKPOCKET was " almost universally disliked " back in 1959 , even if this did not prevent him from naming it Bresson's masterpiece . Over the years , for some inexplicable reason , I missed out on it a couple of times on late-night Italian TV so I was ecstatic when Criterion released a typically exhaustive SE DVD of it in late 2005 ; even though I purchased PICKPOCKET while I was in Hollywood , I preferred to wait for the ' right ' time to watch it . . . and that time was a week ago today ! Even if I haven't exactly been watching much challenging fare lately , I have to say that I haven't stopped thinking about the film in all of that time . The basic story is , as with most of Bresson's films , deceptively simple : a compulsive pickpocket who seems unable to mend his erring ways despite all the goodwill shown him from a friend and a police inspector , finally sees the light and redeems himself through the love of a saintly young girl . Although it seems that this basic story-line shares more than a passing resemblance to Dostoyevsky's " Crime and Punishment " - hardly surprising given Bresson's future cinematic adaptations of Dostoyevsky in A GENTLE CREATURE ( 1969 ) and FOUR NIGHTS OF A DREAMER ( 1971 ) - as usual with Bresson , the substance of the work under scrutiny is in the microscopic curiosity with which he studies his subjects or " models " as he used to call his performers . In this instance , the models he utilizes are even more ' distant ' than in his previous films : Martin Lassalle as the pickpocket Michel has a great , blank face which perfectly encapsulates a character who cannot help himself from flirting with danger by accosting perfect strangers in trains , racetracks and the like and furtively proceed to strip them of their valuables ; the angelic visage of Marika Green ( the aunt of the equally scrumptious Eva Green ) as a neighbor of Michel's sickly mother who secretly harbors an unrequited love for him but who will eventually be his unwitting road to salvation ; and Pierre Leymarie as Michel's well-meaning but gutless friend Jacques . Bresson , as is his fashion , prefers to watch the proceedings from a distance and fails to pass any kind of moral judgment on Michel's relentless plying of his anti-social trade . This may not sit in well with mainstream film-goers in search of an exciting thriller - although Bresson did admit that the germ of the idea that became PICKPOCKET was sown after a viewing of Samuel Fuller's terrific Cold War noir , PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET ( 1953 ) - or a moralistic tale with a neat resolution . Having said that , PICKPOCKET is at its best during the positively enthralling ( and , in retrospect , chilling ) pickpocketing sequences in which wallets are seen performing incredibly acrobatic acts as they pass from one thief's deft hand to the other's and back again to its snug original position inside the pockets of its blissfully unsuspecting owner ! Michel's companions in crime are played by the film's " technical adviser " ( and future sleight-of-hand cabaret performer ) Kassagi and Pierre Etaix ( who would subsequently become a multi-talented film comic of the Keaton school ) . Bresson's powers of film editing , which due to his films ' deliberate solemnity are not immediately apparent , reach an intoxicating level of precision in these scenes which leave one breathless and improbably rooting for the pickpockets . Even so , their luck does run out along the course of the film and all three ( although Michel seems to openly invite it ) are eventually apprehended and brought to justice . Some critics have tried to attach a sexual ( even homosexual ) subtext to , among other things , Michel's " orgasmic " elation as he transfixes his victims with his stare while skillfully rummaging through their personal belongings . . . but , from this one viewing , I can't seriously buy into that . Bresson strips away all unnecessary sentiment and rhetorical explanation for Michel's immoral actions and his unflinchingly uncompromising cinematic viewpoint extends to dismissing the death of Michel's mother and a narrow escape to London - two events which would have been expounded upon unnecessarily by lesser film-makers - in a couple of short shots which barely register if one is not sufficiently attentive : the mother's demise is particularly ironic in that Michel is seen exclaiming assuredly to her that she will live through this current ordeal but the very next shot takes us to her wake during which the brash , arrogant Michel - he who " believed in God . . . for three minutes " - cannot help but let a lone tear stream down his cheeks . On the other hand , however , Bresson occasionally deems it fit to repeat things ( sometime three times over ) as when , for example , the events of a pickpocketing incident inside a bank are seen written in Michel's diary - although whether this is part of Michel's jail-term memoirs a ' la Dennis Price's in KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS ( 1949 ) is unclear - narrated over the soundtrack by Michel himself and actually enacted out visually as well ! As you can see PICKPOCKET is a subtly complex and sublimely rewarding film experience and the fact that it runs for a mere 76 minutes makes that rare achievement all the more remarkable . The film also boasts what has now become one of my favorite closing lines in all of cinema : " Oh , Jeanne , what a strange path I had to take to find you ! " So , what is the final verdict : is PICKPOCKET Bresson's greatest film ? Debatable . Is it one of the greatest films ever made ? Undoubtedly .
