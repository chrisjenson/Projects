Unbelievably bad ?	I had never heard of Dead Man's Bounty when I saw it at the DVD store a few weeks ago , and I thought I had stumbled upon an unrecognized gem , since it had Val Kilmer in it in a truly unique role . Sadly , it wasn't more than ten or fifteen minutes into the movie that I realized that this is a disaster of epic proportions . The first clue you will see of how genuinely awful this movie is comes near the beginning , when you have a bunch of dirtbags in an old saloon laughing like a bunch of hyenas in a scene that goes on about five times too long . It's unbelievable how bad it is . And sadly , it doesn't get any better . Val Kilmer is featured prominently on the movie's cover box , maybe to trick you into thinking that he has a role in the film , but unfortunately his bizarre role as a dead man is overlooked in favor of focusing on a bunch of half-wit crooks and the most inept conceptualization of a unique town sheriff that I've ever seen in a movie . He's played by Boguslaw Linda , who is unable to or uninterested in covering his Polish accent , immediately making it impossible that the movie is meant to take place in the American old west . Does Poland have this type of frontier past ? I don't know . My knowledge of Polish history is not my strong point , but I can tell you this , The Sheriff , as he is known in the movie , is the worst representation of law enforcement that I can ever remember seeing in a movie . He is introduced in a truly ridiculous scene where he is wearing some kind of blindfold and a roomful of men take turns punching him in the face . Before they start hitting him , he explains that they can each hit him once , and then , after the first round , they will each hit him again , and if he can identify who is throwing the punches , they lose . What the hell is this crap ? I am completely at a loss to explain why a scene like this would ever be put into any movie . Throughout the movie , the Sheriff continues to appear more and more beaten and bruised and drunk and battered , until ultimately he does nothing but show up occasionally , stumbling on screen and mumbling " not ? without . . . the law ? " You see , there is a lot of talk and preparation for a hanging , the details of which are as meaningless as the rest of the movie . It takes place , by the way , in a town that consists of nothing more than two ramshackle wooden buildings facing each other across a flattened bit of dirt that is more of a path than a road . My understanding is that it is a part of Poland that is supposed to look acceptably enough like the American southwest , where none of the characters , except maybe the dead guy , could possibly have come from . I have heard that Val Kilmer accepted the role because he was intrigued by his unique role , and also by director Uklanski's minimal use of dialogue in favor of a reliance on cleverly timed juxtaposition of images in unique visual montages . Yeah , whatever . Seems to me that Kilimer was unable to overcome what must have been the truly satisfying feeling that he must have gotten when he was offered the role . Personally , I would really feel that I had reached quite some level of success if someone approached me and offered me probably a few hundred thousand dollars to come and lay still for a while . I like to think that he didn't even read the script for this mess , because if he did I am at a total loss to understand why he accepted the role . At any rate , the movie opens with a man bringing in the corpse of a man , played by Kilmer , seeking the reward . Soon he finds himself embroiled in a ludicrous love story involving the town prostitute , the alcoholic Sheriff , and lots of mayhem involving a series of stupid , stupid characters . There is also a extensive and preposterous lack of understanding of American rituals . In one scene , a man cuts a cherry tomato in half and squishes the halves into Kilmer's eyes ( for what reason , I can't imagine ) , and then later , a man makes a short speech over Kilmer's corpse , in which he explains that he was " one of the finest men we ever had , " and then he proceeds to lop his head off with a shovel . What the HELL ? ? Not convinced yet ? Here are some more reasons not to watch it . In one scene the Sheriff appears to be covered with ash , except for the perfectly clean areas around his eyes and what can only possibly be described as bright red lipstick . A man gets a head wound that drenches his head and body in blood . In a daze , he cauterizes it with gunpowder . Smart . Near the end , the Sheriff appears to have a broken arm . Sitting at the bar , he puts a rope around his neck and connects it to his injured arm , and uses his good arm to pull on the rope , lifting his shaking beer glass in his bad arm to his mouth , rather than using his good arm to drink . Also smart . Why doesn't he just use his good arm ? I have no idea . That , like everything else in the movie , makes no sense whatsoever , like the title . Summer Love ? Are you kidding me ? Avoid this mess at all costs . In the meantime , here's something for the IMDb Goofs page ? Errors made by characters ( possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers ) : This movie got made . HA !
Orgy of the Dead ? Orgy of the DEAD ? ? What's dead in this movie ? NOTHING !	Except for the obvious , of course , like the acting , directing , the script , the tremendously awful set , startlingly bad editing , etc . This massively bad film is supposedly based on a novel , although there is about enough going on in the film to fill a paragraph at most . It amazes me that this mess was actually at some point stretched out into an entire novel . So some guy named Bob takes his nervous girlfriend out to a cemetery in the middle of the night , sure that the trip will provide him with the necessary inspiration to come up with his next great horror story . I am reminded of just about every interview of Stephen King that I've ever seen or read as Bob explains to his girlfriend why he writes about that stuff instead of something happier and more joyful . As Bob explains , horror sells better than flowers and daisies . Maybe Ed Wood should have taken his own advice . Obviously written under a severe writer's block , Orgy of the Dead starts off with literally the worst editing that I have ever seen in a film of any kind ( student films included ) . At the beginning of the film , Bob's girlfriend is complaining to him that she's nervous to be out in the mountains driving around when it's pitch black outside , except they keep cutting to exterior shots of the car driving down mountain roads in BROAD DAYLIGHT . They didn't even bother to use day for night photography even a LITTLE bit . This may as well have been two in the afternoon in July , yet whenever we see a close-up of them , it's inky blackness outside . Outstanding ! The rest of the film is nothing but a variety of women dancing to awful , awful music , and in most cases performing awful , awful dances , while ' The Emperor ' looks on and decides their ultimate fate based on how pleased he is with their performances ( which please him regardless of how terrible they are ) . There is absolutely nothing here that even slightly resembles a horror film , except for a couple of total idiots in ridiculous K-Mart costumes , and a lot of terrible acting . And terrible , by the way , is an enormous understatement . At one point , while they're tied up and forced to watch the ladies do their dances ( ahh ! ! The torture ! ! ! ) , Bob's girlfriend closes her eyes and grows silent , to which Bob responds , ' Don't panic ! ' Every single shot must have been the first take , I guarantee the film was filmed and edited in less than a day . What a total waste of an afternoon that must have been .
The Rock has become a tourist attraction ? ! ?	Yeah , a long time ago it turned into a tourist attraction . Now it's a prison again . Kind of . Well , it's more like an airport mixed together with a junior high school but there are lots of guys running around wearing orange jumpsuits , so I guess in that way it's like a prison . Not really though . When Sasha , Steven Seagal's character , is being admitted into prison , he's standing shackled in line and wanders over to a different line so he can talk to his friend , like he's in line for the security check at the airport . Then before too long he and his friend are throwing punches , smacking around a couple of security guards . Let me tell you something . You assault a corrections officer in a federal prison , they'll shoot you on the spot . Ja Rule would have been shot about 30 times before he threw his second punch . Oh , and there are guys wearing beanies and bandanas and whatnot . In prison . Federal prison . You can't dress like that at most high schools in America . Speaking of Ja Rule , I have to say that the person who probably enjoyed his performance more than anyone else on earth , including Ja Rule himself , had to have been 50 Cent . Just before I watched this movie I saw one of those shows on TV about the greatest celebrity feuds ever , and like number 7 or 8 was this rivalry between 50 Cent , who had lived the thug life for real , and Ja Rule . Who had not . Every time I saw Ja Rule on screen the only thing I could picture was 50 Cent laughing his ass off . Ja Rule looks like a rowdy 9-year-old every time he appears on screen . Anyway , getting back to the plot . It's funny . Sasha is an FBI agent working undercover and he agrees to let himself be sentenced to prison so he can get behind the criminal organization . He's sentenced to five years , and that old line between determination and stupidity instantly vanishes . Nothing else in the movie matters after that , it becomes a meaningless string of action sequences , most of which aren't even well choreographed . Oh , how about this , a helicopter crashes through the roof of " New Alcatraz " at one point , accidentally freeing all of the inmates . And what do they do ? They all run out of their cells and play basketball in the middle of the cell block . Without so much as a basket . They had a ball , but it doesn't matter . The scene is so stupid they might as well have been playing hopscotch . So some guy is being sentenced to be the first person ever to be executed in Alcatraz's state of the art execution chamber , evidently not for stealing $200 million dollars in gold , but for not telling where it was hidden once he was caught . Hey , good thinking , people . If you can't get information out of someone , kill them . That's a great way to learn the truth ! So some gang breaks into the prison planning to stop the execution and get the location of the $200 million for themselves . Oh and the $200 million is in gold bricks . I doubt they thought ahead to how difficult it would be to turn that into exchangeable currency . There's also the issue of the warden at the prison . He's some tough-talking vato who thinks he's a hardcore chollo from the barrio , which reminds me of a joke . I saw this comedian once talking about people in California who talk all tough calling each other ese and homes and all kinds of other such nonsense . These people go to Mexico , the comedian says , and they're like , " Oh my god ! People LIVE there ? That's like , a total shack ! " The best is when the United States Supreme Court Justice arrives and this guy tells her that her men can't carry their guns inside his prison , " I don't care if she IS a United States Supreme Court Justice ! " This woman could squish him like a grape and he thinks he's in charge . Ha . And by the way , the Supreme Court Justice that gets taken as a hostage in the movie tells the bad guy that she is 53 . That's a year younger than Steven Seagal . I just thought that was funny . The only good scene in the movie is the one in the prison where Ja Rule is getting slapped around the prison like a sack of cotton balls by this little Asian woman . That was the funniest thing I've seen in a movie in a long , long time . You know , I work for the company that produced this film ( which I why I watched it ) , and I still don't have a single positive thing to say about it , except , of course , for that one scene with Ja Rule getting spanked by that Asian woman . So read my review of Malena and you will see how strongly I sometimes disagree with professional film critics like Roger Ebert , but in his review of this movie Ebert wrote something that I agreed with as much as anything else he's ever written : " I imagine the flywheels at the MPAA congratulating each other on a good day's work as they rated ' Half Past Dead ' PG-13 , after giving the anti-gun movie ' Bowling for Columbine ' an R . " Way to go , guys .
f .	Remember that movie Wild Wild West ? Will Smith has said that that movie is one of his biggest regrets , because it opened at # 1 even though it sucked , and he said he hated knowing that so many people were spending their money to watch a movie that wasn't good . At the time I'm writing this , Obsessed is the # 1 movie in the American box office , and I'm wondering if , for example , Beyonce feels as guilty as Will Smith did , because Wild Wild West is about ten times better than this snoozefest . Personally I doubt she has the acting chops to even realize how god-awful this thing is . I've seen some backwards thrillers in my time but THIS ? I care hardly think of where to start . My first question is for Beyonce . I'm wondering if , when she signed on to play the wife of a man stalked by a psychotic blonde , if she knew that her character would ultimately turn out to be just as psychotic as the psychotic one . I'm guessing yes , because here's a direct quote from her character late in the movie ? " You think you're crazy ? I'll show you crazy ! " Wow . If you want to watch Ali Larter squeezing her limited talents into the form of a badly written blonde with some relationship issues and Beyonce talking all tough to her ( and to her husband ) , you might enjoy this movie . Every once in a while a movie comes along that is so flawlessly terrible that the perfection of the way the badness fits together becomes a fascinating area of study . This is one of those times . Sharon is married to Derek who has a new employee at his work , a crazy hot blonde named Lisa who was recently hired on from a temp agency . She falls in love with Derek and forms a fantasy in her head that she and Derek are together , blah blah blah blah . The movie is called Obsessed and stars two women and one man . You don't really need to know anything else in order to know everything there is to know about the movie , except how bad it is . Sadly , you have to watch it to find that out . One of my favorite things was that the movie is as suspenseless as any movie I've ever seen , and yet the suspense music kicks up constantly and I guess we're supposed to scoot forward to the edge of our seats and get all worried and whatnot . There's a scene when Lisa e-mails a picture of herself to Derek which opens itself in a dozen windows as soon as he opens the e-mail , and the orchestra kicks in frantically as Derek slowly clicks them each closed , his wife only seconds away . Did anyone else laugh at this ? First of all , why would you slowly click them closed one by one ? Does he know nothing about computers ? ALT-F4 , man ! ! Or if it's a Mac , Command-W ! ! But of course , if he knew how to close windows like that then we would have missed out on the sheer tension of watching this guy about to suffer the wrath of Beyonce . They actually tried to generate TENSION by having a guy struggling to close windows on his computer before his wife sees it ! ! HAHAHAHAHAHAAA ! ! ! Then again , with a wife as horrific as Beyonce's character , maybe it's a good idea to fear her hysterical wrath . She does , after all , kick him out of HIS OWN HOUSE for three months because she thinks . Not KNOWS , mind you . She SUSPECTS that he had an affair . And when I say his own house , I mean the beautiful , multi-million dollar mansion that they live in , with the sleek new Escalade parked out front . This woman , ladies and gentlemen , is a COLLEGE STUDENT . I have trouble relating to a man who would suffer so much ridiculous punishment at the hands of an insecure and violently suspicious woman , and still beg on his hands an knees for her to take him back . In order for a movie like this to work , you have to care about the characters , that's obvious , but it's impossible here . Obsessed has nothing going for it . It's a movie about one poor guy with two psychotic women around him and I'm going to go ahead and suggest that it's just not possible to make a good movie when your basic premise is so overflowing with the yawn-inducing clichés of cheap , no-rent thrillers . It is informative that Obsessed comes from David Loughery , the same screenwriter who gave us the highly disappointing thriller Lakeview Terrace last year . Obsessed is pretty much exactly the same story , except Lakeview Terrace was about a black neighbor angry at his interracial neighbors . Now we have a black wife going crazy at her black husband's white stalker . Set your watch to beep every ten minutes or so to make sure you can stay awake . It was a struggle for me ! Even worse , I'm not sure who the target is . Angry black women who hate skinny , smart-ass blondes ? Maybe . Word has it that the original title was " Oh No She Didn't , " which would at least have been amusing and advertised right away that the whole movie is a joke . If they had made this a parody , I really think it could have been good , but it takes itself super - seriously , even when challenging us not to laugh at Beyonce flinging Ali Larter all over her house , or not to cringe when she viciously berates her boyfriend , for whom she has not the wispiest scrap of trust but who has committed no crime . The most effective thing that the movie does is convince me beyond a shadow of a doubt that if I ever find myself dating Beyonce I will throw myself in front of the nearest train .
Wow , this is incredibly bad .	Knowing that several of the actors in this movie have turned in remarkable roles in other films and television shows , I have come to suspect that the massive performance deficiencies displayed in this film are the result of what appears to be nonexistent direction . When I look at the performances given here , I can only picture director Russell Mulcahy standing behind the camera giving the same direction that Bob MacKenzie ( Rick Moranis ) was given by his brother Doug in Strange Brew ( " PSST ! ! Act ! Act ! ! " ) . I am familiar with a good portion of the work of Jules Verne , as well as the astonishing and disappointing creative liberties that are so often taken with his work ( it still blows my mind completely that they added a DUCK to the 1959 adaptation of Journey to the Center of the Earth ) , but I have not read Mysterious Island so I don't know how faithful the film is to the original story . In any case , there is not a single passable performance in the movie , the direction is completely witless , and the special effects are deplorable . A 15-year-old with an outdated copy of After Effects could do better than this . Besides all that , I will be perfectly happy to live out the rest of my life and never again see a movie in which someone washes up onto a beach , sleeping soundly , and then coughs once or twice before getting up to go exploring . Are the giant insects not enough reason for suspension of disbelief ? And don't even get me started on the pirates , my god what a joke . First of all , not only do our heroes react with hostility and violence when they finally encounter other normal human beings of the non - gigantic - man - eating - insect variety on the island , but after inviting them over to their humble Robinson Crusoe home , complete with dinner table , place settings for ten , goblets , eating utensils , candles , and the like , but once convinced of the defected pirates ' trustworthiness , they give one of them - a caveman looking sort from years surviving on the island ? a total celebrity makeover , shave , haircut , gel , new clothes , etc . I guess they forgot that they are surviving , too . The worst thing that the movie does , besides the deplorable performances and ridiculous screenplay ( I can even forgive awful direction as long as the effort is there ) , is that it tries to create dramatic and intense situations when there is no reason for it . The captain jumps maybe 15 feet into the water to lighten the load on the hot air balloon , and everyone freaks out as though he jumped out of a plane . Other humans are greeted with suspicion as though anyone has any reason to be afraid for their lives . At one point , the eagle-eyed Neb , played by Omar Gooding , uses a telescope to spot a massive , four-masted pirate ship maybe a hundred yards off shore . He calls to the captain and explains that he has spotted a pirate ship and hands him the telescope , somehow intuitively knowing that the captain will not be able to see Old Ironsides blotting out the horizon without it . I'll go right ahead and admit that I had extremely low expectations for the show , it's made-for-TV , first of all , and I've yet to see a single competently made Jules Verne film adaptation , but I've seen better acting in an elementary school drama class , and the script could not possibly be dumber . Who thought it would be a good idea to have the good guys sneak up on the pirate ship behind a floating log , for God's sake ? ? Come on guys , let's just swim right out to the ship , no one will notice ! Wow . Miss this one .
Zzzzzzzzz ?	The story of In the Year 2889 is your standard bad b-movie plot about the end of the world , except there is not a single thing done to make the world look futuristic . I would grant that they managed to pull off a thick , muggy version of the early 70s , so I guess they achieved a few years of a futuristic look , but it's more likely that I just can't tell the difference between 1967 and , say , 1972 or so . The movie is an exercise in ham-handed and clunky story-telling . The sound dubbing is amazingly bad and doesn't even begin to match the action on screen , but no matter . Clearly this is a no-budget production so things like this must be forgiven . Or at least excused . The characters are in a fallout shelter , and wouldn't you just know it , it comes complete with a detailed miniature model of the house and surrounding area so that the inhabitants , mostly people who live in the area , can be informed about how the surrounding mountains will protect them from the radioactive fallout . You see , the mountains are filled with lead , so any radioactivity will pass harmlessly over their heads like radio waves . Pretty convenient , although there is some concern because rain would swiftly deliver nuclear death . There is meant to be some tension about the rising radioactivity in the air , except that any exterior scenes never look like anything other than a beautiful sunny day . So there is this thing about the radioactivity passing overhead and totally changing the world around them , but soon enough they are just fraternizing and grab-assing in the bomb shelter , and before you know it , the old man is instructing all the women , including his own daughter , that they must all bear children ASAP ! What a guy ! Overall this is basically zero-budget nonsense . There is a title that says " The Beginning " when the movie ends , and this might be the most clever thing in the movie , so I'll let you do the math . It might have been fun had it been made as a student film or something , but the amazingly bad costumes and performances just don't belong in a commercial film meant for public viewing .
Another in a long line of inexplicably successful teen slasher movies that would fall flat if people would realize what they were watching .	I have to admit that I enjoyed this movie when I first saw it . I got a lot of good thrills out of it and basically just had a good time . However , when I watched it on video , the larger than life quality was entirely removed and I noticed a lot of things that hadn't occurred to me when I saw it in the theater . The acting , for example , was absolutely awful from everyone involved except for Anne Heche in the few scenes that she was in . And what is the big deal about Jennifer Love Hewitt ? ! She may be moderately attractive but she is one of the worst actresses I've ever seen , and I've seen some horrible acting ( see " Nightmare Weekend " ) . Sarah Michelle Gellar is totally unconvincing and Ryan Phillippe delivers the worst performance of his career . And don't even get me started on Freddie Prinze Jr . His eyebrows say it all every time . Besides that , the story , although theoretically possible , was terribly presented . A bunch of teenagers are partying and driving out in the hills late at night , they accidentally hit a man and , thinking he's dead , dump his body into a river to avoid having their lives needlessly ruined . Did anybody notice that just before the man in question had a little underwater tug-of-war with Barry ( Ryan Phillippe ) for Helen's ( Sarah Michelle Gellar ) princess crown , the man opened his eyes and Barry actually screamed in terror ? Given that , I hope I wasn't the only one laughing every time these morons speculated that " maybe he wasn't really dead . . . " HE GRABBED THE CROWN , HELD IT FIRMLY WHILE IT WAS WRENCHED FROM HIS FINGERS , AND OPENED HIS EYES , YOU IDIOTS ! ! ! How could they have been so stupid ? Of COURSE he wasn't dead . Besides that , why did he torment these poor kids ? They did him a favor ! Because of ' what they did last summer , ' he is now able to perform superhuman acts . Not only can he survive tremendous bodily harm ( in true Michael Myers form ) , but he can also perform menial tasks like loading and unloading a trunk full of crabs ( dead human body optional ) in a matter of seconds , and that includes flawless cleaning ! Think of the market value of a skill like that ! If I were him , I wouldn't be trying to kill anyone , I'd be getting rich ! He can also move with superhuman speed , the lucky guy . Oh wait , you gotta hear about another of my favorite parts . Just after the accident , Barry suggests that they dump the body because it won't do any good for them all to take the fall . Julie then reciprocates by saying that if there is some of the man on the car , then there's some of the car on him and when he's found the police will be able to find out whose car it was . How's that again ? They can do that ? I know that BMWs are nice cars . My uncle owns one , it's an amazing machine . But do they cover those cars with paint which can be used to identify each individual car ? Is that what they are suggesting in this scene ? Or are they just quickly establishing Julie James as a complete moron as early in the film as possible ? She sure was dumb in her cutesy love scene with Ray ( Freddie Prinze Jr . ) at the closing of the film . I never thought I'd say this , but this movie had a love story that was even more clumsily thrown in than your average Jerry Bruckheimer film ( even more than the ridiculous Coyote Ugly , which made an entire film out of one of these goofy romance flops ) . " I wanted you back , Julie . I couldn't lose you again . " " I feel your pain , Ray . " SHUT UP ! ! BOTH OF YOU ! ! I have never seen worse cheese than that in all my life . And yes , she really did say " I feel your pain . " As is obviously the case , I was ultimately not at all impressed by this movie . I liked it when I was in high school and didn't know any better , but now that my head in on straight , I can see that it is clearly a pathetic attempt to cash in on the seemingly endless stream of teen " scream " movies with which the unsuspecting public was bombarded in the late 1990s . If you liked Scream , good for you . It was a good movie . If you want more , stay away from I Know What You Did Last Summer ( as well as its equally awful sequel , I Still Know What You Did Two Summers Ago ) , and also try to avoid the mediocre Scream sequels . Watch something that is at least moderately entertaining , like Urban Legend ( I said entertaining , not original ) or The Blair Witch Project . I Know What you Did Last Summer is an honest attempt , but it is also a dismal failure .
Dee Snider seems to be desperately trying to hold onto the weird persona that he developed as the singer for Twisted Sister .	Strangeland is a terrible horror / technological thriller . Dee Snider plays Carleton Hendricks , a disgusting computer freak who prays on young girls through the chat rooms . His ridiculous philosophies on pain and suffering are both misguided and totally unfounded . There is no tie to reality with the ideas that are presented in this film , it is more like Dee Snider sat down and tried to think up the weirdest stuff possible to impress horror fans and maybe some of his old fans , but the end result is just awful . Unfortunately for me , as a horror fan , the cover of this movie looks very good and it immediately caught my interest , which is the main reason that I was tricked into watching it . I assure you that this is not a quality horror movie . It is a disturbing yet boring attempt to suggest what might go on in the minds of people who treat themselves the way the Carleton Hendricks did in this film . The sad part is that NO one does this stuff to themselves . Marilyn freakin ' Manson doesn't even go that far , and the fact that he had a song on the soundtrack makes it clear that the film wasn't meant to poke fun at his type of music ( that would be a stab at Snider himself ) , it is more like Dee Snider was trying to raise himself from the career-dead and present himself as a sick-minded individual once more . Dee , it seems that the time has come to let it all die . . .
Don't these people realize that time travel IS playing God ?	I have this undying love of movies that have anything to do with time travel , which is why I picked up this rather obscure film that I had heard of from the video store . The problem here is that the movie's intentions are too obvious . Time travel can never work , that much is a given , and it follows then that time travel movies take advantage of a human fascination in the concept , and have an overwhelming tendency , therefore , to be made almost entirely for entertainment purposes . Enter Time Changer , an ultra-religious film whose very title implies that one of it's characters will have the God-like capability of traveling through time . So the movie is pretty straightforward religious propaganda , by definition . That much is pretty obvious , regardless of your own or my own personal religious beliefs . It is a film made to promote a certain religious viewpoint , and I think that this is something to keep in mind before watching it . I certainly didn't expect it , and I can't say that I was very pleasantly surprised . The film starts out in the late 1800s , at a table of men discussing the publication of a new book , which deals with the benefits of adhering to the morals of Christianity , but without an attachment to the names of God or Jesus . The men sit around the table thrilled at the idea , hopeful that it should be able to collectively improve the lives of people who would like to lead moral lives but are not inclined toward believing in Jesus or God . The younger audience are particularly targeted by this idea . There are six or seven or so of these men , all excited to publish the book as soon as possible , but one of them shows up late , vehemently denouncing the novel and fighting against its publication . He says that this belief in the morals of God but without FEAR of God is dangerous , and just so happens to have a time machine that has allowed him to travel 100 years into the future so that he can prove himself right . He urges the author of the book , Russell Carlisle ( an abysmal performance from D . David Morin ) , to use the time machine himself so that he can travel to modern times and see the results of the ideas put forth in his proposed book . He eventually does , and comes face to face with normal modern society , and finds himself appalled at what has become of the church . Personally , I don't believe that someone living a moral life but without the fear of God is doing a thing in the world wrong . The addition of fear , of any kind , into an already moral life in needless and even detrimental . From a technical standpoint , the film is a low-tech mess , coherent but with basal production standards . The acting is absolutely awful across the board , and the idea of a time machine invented in the 1890s ( even if only because the idea of time travel , more than a century later , is so astronomical that it is not even attempted by serious modern scientists ) is childish , at best . I'm willing to accept the premise of a time machine being invented and used in the 1890s in order to travel into the future and see what kind of world a book like the one presented would help to create , but only from a pure entertainment standpoint . I would love to see a movie about Einstein inventing a time machine and traveling to the future and seeing what he thinks of space travel and the Back to the Future movies and whatnot , but Time Changer is trying to take itself and be taken more seriously than it deserves . I will grant credit to the fact that society at large may hold religious beliefs that are certain to be horrifying to the religious community of 110 years ago , but I am not willing to admit that someone who lives a moral life but does not connect their morals with Jesus is living in sin or , even more ludicrous , has any chance of spending an eternity in Hell . I know far too many people who live happily , have wonderful families , and are good and civil to their fellow man to have the ability to believe or ever be convinced that they will spend eternity burning in a lake of fire because they do not attend church regularly or make Jesus or God a significant portion of their lives , and I do not feel obliged to believe in a God who is so self righteous that He would damn people like that . If you do , more power to you . To each his own , I say . But picture this , just hypothetically ? man is living in harmony . There are no gangs , no murders , no wars , no hatred , racism , robberies , or weapons of mass destruction . All of the humans on earth are living happily with themselves and with each other . But none of them attach the morals by which they live their lives to Jesus . Granted , this is a purely hypothetical situation that I don't believe is humanly possible , but just pretend that was how life on earth was at this moment . Do you think that God would condemn every human on earth , the humans described above , because they did not attribute their achievements and morals to Jesus ? I realize that Jesus died for our sins , if that's your belief . But it just seems to me that , if God created humanity and the earth and the heavens , a whole planet full of benevolent humans living in peace might be viewed as something of a success , rather than something to condemn . But hey , if you think all those people's souls should spend eternity in a lake of fire , Time Changer is the movie for you . And ONLY you .
Why the title ? Maybe all the good ones were taken ?	Anyway , the overlying problem with The Scream of the Wolf is that it hints in a certain direction and then goes exactly in that direction , rendering the entire movie a tired exercise in horror movie making which takes you where you knew all along it was going to go . The film starts with a brutal murder , and the cops investigating dance around the solution , which the audience has been yelling at the screen and which would be ridiculously obvious to them if they knew they were in a horror film . The movie is not scary even for a second , but that doesn't really matter because there's exactly a single movie made in the 1970s that's still scary . What matters is that there is a character named Byron , the prime suspect through most of the movie , who does not serve the purpose that it is imperative his character serve . ( spoilers ) Byron is what you might call the obvious answer . The suspect who simply can't be guilty just because of the fact that his guilt is so obvious . That would be like if Shephard was the real killer in Twisted . Byron's purpose in this movie is to distract the audience and , more importantly , the cops , from the real solution by acting cocky and guilty ( which he does every second he's onscreen ) in order to throw us , and the cops , off the right track . What Byron is NOT supposed to do is run around acting guilty because he is . Not only is there no twist whatsoever in this movie ( an absolutely essential element in a horror mystery ) , but the real killer is not even a werewolf , which the title implies , but nothing more than a dog trained to kill by an obsessed hunter . Was THAT the twist ? ? I really hope it wasn't , because it's not the kind of twist that leaves you slapping your forehead because you hadn't already guessed it , it's the kind of twist that leaves you slapping your forehead because you just spent 80 minutes watching this movie .
Mindless comedy . Not worth watching if you are looking for anything other than a cheesy and pointless story about a man's extremely unlikely bad luck .	Jamie Foxx comes forth with another dumbass comedy , but at least in this one he pretends that he can possibly portray a respectable person . Trapped in a tiny town full of rednecks , Michael ( Foxx ) tries to recover from his fiancee ( Nia Long , whose talent was even more wasted than it was in Big Momma's House ) leaving him just after his beloved car was stolen , when he finds himself stuck in the middle of a botched robbery . Yes , this is your stereotypical hick town . They have to have a tremendously fat guy ( remember Billy Bob from Varsity Blues ? ) , the police force winds up running around in their boxer shorts , and the sheriff seems to care more about the local sporting events than he does about saving the hostages in the gas station . This movie may not have been so awful had it not been for the fact that the writers were clearly trying to grab for laughs every second of the way , while ignoring the necessary elements ( even in a slapstick comedy ) of reality and credibility . ( spoilers ) The robbers become likeable , so of course the film has to have a happy ending . That's fine , but what happened ? They got on the bus , rode off into the sunset , and evidently the idiot police force went back to their baseball game , because they ignored the fact that the attempted robbers just drove away . ' Oh well , let's just all go home ! ' Even country police forces aren't that stupid . Held Up is slow paced , it's often boring , and it takes a serious situation and tries to get stupid laughs by making ridiculous efforts to make it all funny . It tries to force a smile on unhappy material , and was therefore doomed from the beginning . Hardcore Jamie Foxx fans may enjoy his cornball antics in this movie , but anyone looking for even the smallest hint of quality in their cinematic entertainment would be best advised to ignore this garbage .
Terrible fun !	I have read that Van Damme has since admitted to being embarrassed by Derailed , which I can understand but at the same time I find to be a little sad . True , the movie is something of a disaster , but I wish people would have a bit of an open mind about movies like this . The movie is almost cartoonishly bad , so I really wonder what the tone was in the air when they were making it ( surely they had to know that they were making a terrible movie ) , but I will venture to say that the badness of a movie like this doesn't at all make it unwatchable . On the contrary , I think it makes it more fun , the way a wildly over-the-top movie like Shoot ' Em Up is more fun than something that is just a little too much , like some of Seagal's movies . As they say , for some reason people often forgive extreme excesses more than mild excess . The Grindhouse team certainly understands this . Also , just like it should have been clear to the production team that they were making a classic bad movie , it is also clear from the minute you see the cover box ( which has one of those direct-to-video appearances that is so thorough that the DVD case itself has an appearance of hollowness ? I almost expected to see a DVD-R in there ) what kind of movie this is . But many people , myself included , are such dedicated Van Damme fans that we will watch anything he makes , even if we are fully aware that the movie is a ? ahem ? train wreck . From the very opening we get an almost home-movie feel , like the kind of weekend video that some kids would make with their friends using their parents video camera and cutting it with something like iMovie . A woman breaks into a highly secured bunker to steal a biological weapon with astonishing capabilities to kill enormous numbers of people , and has so little trouble doing it it's almost funny . She is able to casually beat the crap out of some security guards , maybe because she has some cool yellow sunglasses on . Before long she finds herself being escorted across the border by Jacques Kristoff ( Van Damme ) , an international agent who doesn't know anything about what she's carrying and who's job is so secretive that his own wife and family don't even know the truth about what he does . It's because of this that he soon finds himself suspected by his family of having an affair and soon everyone is against him as he sets out to save the world . The supporting cast of baddies is so bad that it literally is the funniest thing in the entire movie . There is one scene early in the film where a few of the bad guys are filing into one of the train cars full of terrified passengers , and one of them ( the black guy ) looks almost directly at the camera as he passes it , and the expression on his face is so outlandishly goofy that that moment alone made me think that the whole movie is something of an inside joke , like they watched the dailies and laughed hysterically when they saw things like this ( like I did ) , and said " Yeah , put that in ! CLASSIC ! ! " I have to admit that on a certain level I did enjoy the movie . Yes , it's a bad movie and there is no denying that , but it is still enjoyable on a level that truly bad movies are not . Still , I'm trying to come up with something specific that I enjoyed , and it's not an easy task . The performances are horrendous , the writing is worse , and the special effects and the stunts might be the most famously bad parts of the movie . But in that , I think is where you can still enjoy it . When things are so bad that it is almost fascinating to watch the movie unfold before you , it becomes entertaining to see what other failed experiments they managed to come up with , and in that sense they were pretty creative when making this movie . The motorcycling on top of the train , the people being killed and then coming back later , the super-powerful biological weapon that looks like a couple test tubes full of Chem-light fluid , and the ridiculous villain all come together and make something that is morbidly fun to wonder about . I love how the villain is characterized , by the way . It's not enough that he has taken an entire train hostage and is trying to get his hands on a weapon of mass destruction , they have to really let us know how evil he is , so out of absolutely nowhere , he picks up a passenger's violin and curiously muses that it's a French model from around the 1800s and then smashes it on the table . Biological weapons are one thing , but a man who would casually smash a 200-year-old French violin ? Oh , the humanity ! ! Obviously , there have been a lot of comparisons to Under Siege 2 , which also took place on a train , but mostly I think people make this comparison try to really get the point across about how bad this movie it . Yes , it's a bad movie , one of Van Damme's worst , but with the right frame of mind it is still enjoyable on some sad level . But if you can't thoroughly enjoy bad movies , you'll do well to avoid this one !
Bigger , gorier , louder , faster ? and worse .	The new Texas Chainsaw Massacre , which is something of a remake but not in the same vein as simply colorizing the film , as they foolishly did with Psycho in 1998 , is another look into how audiences have changed since the early 1970s . The original Texas Chainsaw film was an instant success because so many people immediately condemned it as a grotesquely violent film that celebrated some of the most vile human behaviors imaginable . They were right about what it was , but as has for centuries been the case with literature , the fastest way for a movie to become a success is to be banned . Texas Chainsaw was never banned in America that I know of , but its reputation clearly generated much of the interest in the film . Today's audiences are obviously not as easily shocked . The film starts out great , with archive footage of a police walkthrough of the crime scene although all we really get is a look at a crime scene investigator walking down the stairs to the basement , noting things like fingernails and hair embedded in the walls . The movie then cuts to a group of kids driving across the Texas desert in the summer of 1973 to go to a Lynyrd Skynyrd concert , all the while rocking out to Sweet Home Alabama , which was released in 1974 . Not that that matters . This is not , after all , The Alabama Chainsaw Massacre , and I haven't heard it , but I doubt that Sweet Home Texas is able to create the tone and mood as well . Besides , it's one of the greatest American songs ever written , although having that song in a movie like this is about as logical as putting $2 , 000 chrome rims on an antique tractor . ( spoilers ) The first turn that this movie takes from the original is that instead of a freaky hitchhiker joining the kids on their drive and giving the audience an idea for why these people are so messed up , there is a girl who has barely escaped from the family that these kids are about to meet . Kind of like what happened in Texas Chainsaw III . This girl has been so tormented by what she has been through that she is incoherent and ultimately tells the startled kids in the van that they're all going to die , then she pulls out a gun and kills herself . Speaking of which , here's an interesting thing to consider . She gets in the van wearing this little sundress , which has no pockets . After a while , she opens her legs , reaches into her crotch , and pulls out a standard issue police handgun . Just out of curiosity , where exactly are we to assume that she pulled the gun from ? I doubt that she had a holster strapped to her inner thigh , and it's even less likely that she pulled it out of some hole in the seat of the van . Maybe they hoped people would forget about this logical oddity immediately , which would explain why we next get a view of the kids ' shocked faces through the newly formed hole in the poor girl's head . The fact that the deranged hitchhiker was replaced by a victim does even more immediate damage to the film than the colorization of Psycho , and given the fact that Hitchcock preceded the original by not one but two films in color , I should have thought it would have been obvious that it was black and white for a reason . There is a duality to everything in that film , including the lack of color . Here , the removal of the hitchhiker shows how eager the film is to get to the blood and guts and skip over bothersome things like an explanation for the cause of the carnage that is to follow . It removes the story completely from any attachment to anything that might once have actually happened , and turns it immediately into a stupid teen slasher movie . The teens involved are gradually introduced to the infamous family as they search for a police officer who is interested enough in the girl's death to come out and check out the situation . The first member of the infamous family that they meet is an invention for this version of the film - a dirty little boy wearing Austin Powers teeth . The teeth are , by the way , so fake and so obviously bought at a cheap Halloween store that I'm still not sure whether they are supposed to be the kid's real teeth or if he just likes wearing them , like how some kids keep wearing their vampire fangs after Halloween's over . I'm not sure if this is in the film's defense or just another sign of its vain attempt to shock like the original did , but it does contain the most horrendous chainsaw death of any of the five Texas Chainsaws so far . I'm referring in this case to the kid who gets hung from the chandelier , although the movie also goes to great length to bring back some of the classic torture methods from the original , reminding me that I just don't like meat hooks . Since I don't work in a slaughterhouse and never will , I would be perfectly happy to live the rest of my life and never set eyes on another meat hook . In the movies or otherwise . By far the worst crime that the movie commits is that it turns Leatherface from a truly disturbed individual and into your basic movie monster . Consider the very end , for example , when we get a close up of his face as Erin is escaping , and not only is he growling , but his eyes have changed color . Earlier he took off his mask and we saw that he has no nose , then we saw him again later with a nose and with brown eyes , now he's got fluorescent blue eyes . I have one thing to say about this and most of this movie . What the hell ?
The first submarine photoplay ever filmed !	When I read during the opening credits of the 1916 adaptation of Jules Verne's " 20 , 000 Leagues Under the Sea , " immediately I assumed the frame of mind that I always do when watching early films , so as not to criticize it's lack of special effects or advanced film techniques . Immediately I was immensely impressed at the transfer from book to film , as the film followed the story closely and faithfully . Unfortunately , this only lasted for about the first ten minutes of the film , which ultimately proved to take Verne's work and butcher it in every way imaginable . Probably the most jarring change to the story is that they decided to not only adapt 20 , 00 Leagues , but also another Verne novel , Mysterious Island , into this film . So the result is that you have two totally different stories taking place that don't at all seem to fit together , until finally they come together in the bizarre conclusion , which makes absolutely no sense in respect to the novel . My current theory is that because so much of the original novel of 20 , 000 Leagues was decades beyond the reach of the filmmakers to be able to put on screen , so they probably had to look to an entirely separate novel just to have enough material to fill a full length film . Sadly , it reminds me of those terrible songs that radio stations sometimes come up with when they combine two popular songs together that have a similar beat , resulting in something that is not quite equal to but definitely less than the originals . One such bizarre hybrid comes to mind involving Closer , by Nine Inch Nails , and Garbage's # 1 Crush . The basic , basic , basic plot structure remains , but literally 95 % of the story is gone . There is rumor of a massive sea monster and the crew of the Abraham Lincoln set off to capture it . Strangely enough , at one point it passes a mere few meters from their ship in broad daylight , and the crew can clearly see the steel plated sides and the rivets holding it together , even the bridge and periscope , and yet they still think it's a sea monster . I'll attribute that to the inability to emulate the Nautilus's movements as described in the novel , but in this way we also have to sacrifice the entirety of the ship's glorious design and function , which is not even described in dialogue . For the most part , we see a single room , which looks like an old Victorian bedroom with one wall that looks like it belongs in a boiler room . Probably the worst crime that the film commits is in the character of Captain Nemo . Granted , Nemo in the novel is not exactly the most charming and charismatic man , but it is as if they set out in this film to create a man as far from the original description as humanly possible . As a result , we get a bizarre spectacle that looks like a disgruntled Santa Clause in blackface . And not only that , throughout the film he gives several displays of compassion that the original Nemo would have scoffed at . Indeed , at one point , he torpedoes a ship , and then afterwards and then almost faints as he worries about the safety of the victims . What the hell ? ? And incidentally , Verne's Nautilus didn't have torpedoes , although he did use it as a ramming weapon . In the film's defense , the underwater photography is truly impressive given the time that it was filmed , and surely knocked 1916 audiences , most of whom had probably never seen the underwater world , out of their seats . This would certainly explain the seemingly endless lingering on these scenes . Their is also an interesting allusion to another Verne novel , as at one point in their underwater tour they come across a decayed shipwreck , which Nemo describes as " the wreck of an old blockade runner . " And the worst thing about the bizarre personification of Nemo in this film is the backstory that was invented for the film which , amazingly , is introduced with this intertitle - " Captain Nemo reveals the tragic secret of his life , which Jules Verne never told . " What follows is the most bizarre story imaginable , which claims that Nemo was previously some kind of empirical royalty who lived in an empire " beyond the sea . " One man wrongs him , which doesn't explain his subsequent disdain , and even hatred , for all of mankind of all nations , nor does anything explain why he took to the sea . And incidentally , Nemo is a man of art , science , biology , history , astronomy , etc . The transition from his old life to the one we see is totally senseless . It may very well be that this was one of the first major films to set the trend of adapting novels to film , and while modern adaptations still make ridiculous changes to story and characters where they don't belong , at least those inexplicable liberties seem to have diminished since 1916 !
The first and only Rocky spin-off ?	So I had been under the impression that the United States Military taught things like respect and honor and loyalty and determination . In Over The Top , we are introduced to the graduating class of what I imagine is something like the Junior Marines , where a trucker named Lincoln Hawk has an estranged son celebrating his successful completion of the program . But just when you might think that this place is turning out honorable and respectful young men , we meet Hawk's son , an arrogant little punk more in need of a smack than Rocky's son in Rocky 5 . And that is BAD . He immediately berates Lincoln for his dirty truck and scruffy appearance , wildly disrespecting him and acting like a snotty rich kid . Do you meant to tell me that this place , representing the United States of America , is churning out little punks that demand club soda with lemon when offered water ? Over The Top was released into theaters just over four months before Full Metal Jacket . This may be part of the reason why so few people remember this movie . At any rate , Lincoln ran out on his family when his son Michael was a baby , so Michael was raised by his wealthy grandfather . Now Lincoln wants to make amends for past mistakes , so he picks up Michael from his military school and takes him on a cross-country road trip home . At first Michael is an insufferable jerk , but ultimately warms up to Lincoln as Lincoln teaches him , through arm-wrestling , that he learned nothing about being a man in his time at the military school , but now Lincoln can teach him all he needs to know about manhood and fatherly responsibility by arm-wrestling a lot of sweaty meatheads . I love the realism in the movie . Lincoln Hawk is a quiet , respectful man who only wants to have a relationship with his son . He honestly regrets his past mistakes and will do anything to make them right . Nevertheless , Michael's grandfather wants him out of Michael's life so badly that , even after Lincoln drives his semi-truck through the man's multi-million dollar mansion , he offers to drop all charges if Lincoln will just leave the state . Really ? That's all ? After what must have been hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage inflicted with a deadly vehicular weapon ? I guess so , because Lincoln has no choice but to accept . So he loses his son , sells his meager truck , and heads off to the arm-wrestling world championships in Vegas . I didn't know there WAS an arm-wrestling world championship , but no matter . Lincoln enters as pretty much an unknown , and bets $7 , 000 on himself with 20 : 1 odds . Soon after entering the contest , we hear a broadcaster announce that each contestant can lose once and still have a second chance , and immediately the rest of the movie is spelled out with such clarity that you may notice a distinct sense of deja-vu permeating the rest of the film . I love the other arm-wrestlers , by the way . They are belligerent , mindless morons who are more like apes than men . Professional wrestlers were hired for the movie , but someone should have told them that they are not doing the soap opera of professional wrestling in this movie , and that maybe they could act a little more human than they are used to . Nope , not in this movie ! We get interviews with some of them where they say things like " My whole body is an engine , and this here's the fireplug . And I'm gonna light him up ! " Interesting thoughts , you knob . Others just scream and roar at each other like hyenas , but not Lincoln , he calmly gets on camera and he's not really in it for the money , he just really needs the brand new semi-truck that they're giving away to the winner . I appreciate that it really gets you to root for him , but a LITTLE bit of realism wouldn't have hurt either . Grandpa , for example , comes back at one point and offers Lincoln a brand new truck with a full-sized trailer AND $500 , 000 in cash just to quit the contest . What is that ? Lincoln must surely have done something much worse than drive through the man's front yard for him to make an offer like that just to get Lincoln out of Michaels ' life , but we're left to wonder what that might have been . The biggest problem is that it's just a little too obvious that the movie is a spin-off of the character of Rocky Balboa , with his charm and honesty at war with the vicious world around him . Here , Lincoln is just a simple man wanting to bring his family back together , and the cruel world doing everything possible to keep them apart . The arm-wrestling competition , and particularly the grand prize , was just a little too tailor-made for Lincoln's particular needs . Overall the movie is about genuine repentance after a terrible mistake , and it delivers the message well and it's even a pretty fun ride for a lot of the time , but while the cheese factor is often the best part of a movie like this , here it is just a little too much for the movie to be good and not quite enough for the movie to be fun .
" Go with God and a bag full of guns ? "	I bought Death Sentence because it looked to me like a genuine , well-made thriller and I've been a fan of Kevin Bacon ever since Tremors , which was one of my favorite films when I was a kid . Unfortunately , it very soon devolved into a boring , by-the-numbers revenge thriller , throwing away Bacon's talent . John Goodman is also a genuine talent that is genuinely wasted here . Bacon stars as Nick Hume , an unremarkable man but a good husband and father , good at his work and good with his family , until a tragedy costs the life of his oldest son , just as he was aspiring to the professional hockey world . One night at a gas station the boy is a the victim of a gang initiation , in which a young gangster kills him to gain entry into the gang . The attack is totally unprovoked , of course , unless you count a moment just earlier when the gangsters were street racing side-by-side and Nick flashes his brights at them to remind them to turn their lights on . I seem to remember seeing a movie where a killer would drive with his lights off and then kill the people that flashed their brights at him . Can't remember what it was , though . Anyway , Hume gets a sleazy , lazy lawyer to take the case against the kid who killed his son . The guy tells him that the most they can hope for is to make a deal where the kid will go to prison for a couple years , so Nick is understandably horrified . This mental giant of an attorney mentioned as one of their difficulties that the murder weapon " magically " disappeared . Maybe he's not used to taking murder cases where the killer doesn't leave the murder weapon , a complete set of fingerprints , and maybe a driver's license or credit card or at least a utility bill for some contact information . Magically . This , by the way , is where the movie first starts to go horribly wrong . When the gangster killed Hume's son , the other gangsters sped off without him , and he ran into the street cursing them , at which point a car slammed into him with enough speed to shatter both legs , to say nothing of the certain spinal injury , broken ribs , organ damage and fractured skull . He didn't get knocked over , that car PLOWED into him . Nevertheless , it doesn't occur to any lawyers later to connect the dots about the fact that Hume saw the murder with his own eyes and then saw the murderer get slammed into by a car . He still had to pick the kid out of a lineup ! ! Then later , the police occasionally come to Hume , begging him not to start a war and please stop what he's doing now ? all the while fully aware that he had murdered one of them because he was not satisfied with the conviction that he would have gotten . At one point , he asks the police for help , and he gets , " God help you . " NICE . Clearly , there's not a scrap of thought put into the script , but we can still hope for a fun ride . Sadly , we don't get that either . I was bothered to see John Goodman in such a stupid and pointless role , Bacon is clearly wasting his time , but he's such a good actor that most of the time it's as if he's struggling to squeeze himself into a movie that's too small for him . But the real problem is the gangsters . It's hard to make this kind of thriller when the antagonists are such clownish caricatures . The gang members are mostly stuntmen who are apparently trying out acting for a while , and it is clear why they don't act . After Hume kills the new kid , Joe , there is a laughable scene at a bar where they all tearfully drink to his memory , talking about how much they loved him and how he was a brother to them . It's hard to watch a lot of guys who are not actors struggling to act like hardened gangsters struggling to act emotional . Soon there's a chase scene where the gang is chasing Hume through a parking garage . He runs up one level after another , setting off car alarms all along the way . Why the car alarms , you may wonder ? I don't know , maybe he knows these aren't the smartest guys in the world and he doesn't want them to get lost . Maybe he just doesn't have a can of paint with him to paint arrows on the ground , so car alarms are the best way to make sure they can keep track of him . The end of the film devolves into stereotypical gunfights and bloodshed , with an unexpected turn at the end of Hume and the head gangster both with multiple gunshot wounds but no bullets sitting next to each other on a bench . Pretty interesting confrontation , I hadn't seen that before . It's too bad it had to come after an hour and a half of garbage ! Death Sentence is a good effort , it just doesn't work . Bacon's heart is in the right place but he isn't given anything interesting to do , Goodman's character is pointless entirely so it's a shame that he also has to dumb himself down for it , and James Wan is directing the movie for no other reason than because he directed Saw and the almost strikingly similar Dead Silence . It's too bad . It could have been so much more .
They got the spider all wrong ?	I have studied Shakespeare , so I understand the value of literature that leaves open veritably endless possibilities for individual interpretation of the original work , so normally I wouldn't say anything about an animated version of Charlotte's Web featuring a Charlotte that doesn't look anything like the one illustrated in E . B . White's classic children's book or the one that I imagined while reading it ( which , surprise surprise , was remarkably like the one illustrated in the book ) . The reason that I point this out here is because I have also studied Charlotte's Web at the University level , and have learned that E . B . White went through several illustrators before finally finding one that got the spider to look the way he wanted her to look . And yes , by the way , there are classes at the University level in which Charlotte's Web is required reading , as is Alice In Wonderland , Through The Looking Glass , Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone ( or Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone , if you're not a stupid American like me ) , Captain Underpants , etc . A small amount of research into the history of Charlotte's Web would surely have revealed White's specific requirement that Charlotte look like a real spider , not a cute Disney spider with a bowl cut , a nice smile , and big blue eyes . Adorable , but her appearance here rather defeats the purpose . There are other discrepancies in the movie that take unnecessary artistic liberties from the book , and while some of them I can understand being changed ( such as the fact that Avery , Fern's brother , is introduced skipping happily down the stairs with a big smile rather than as heavily armed as he is when he's introduced in the book ) , other changes had a serious affect on the story as a whole . Wilbur's maturation , like Fern's , is in fast forward and altered all along the way . As soon as he gets to the farm , he misses Fern so much that he won't eat as soon as he's moved to the farm , because he knows that he's been sold and taken away from Fern . In the book he eats so greedily that he buries his head far enough into his food to get it into his ears , and the narrative presents his thoughts , so we know that Wilbur is at least an intelligent creature , even though he doesn't speak out loud at first . The thing that is lost in the movie version is that , since we can't hear his thoughts , the scene where he learns to speak comes off as contrived and ridiculous . The goose tells him that he has to TRY to speak , so he barely manages to snort out his name , and 15 seconds later he's singing ( with a startling vocabulary ) a song all about how amazing it is that he can talk . Not only can he talk , but he can dance and sing showtunes , too ! The lengthy and complicated words that are thrown in for the benefit of Wilbur's song also take away from the effect of the story as a whole , because despite spouting these huge words and even rhyming them together , he later has no idea what Charlotte is talking about when she says ' Salutations ' ( or , later , ' versatile ' ) , a greeting that is meant to signify her intelligence in the book because no words like it had been used up to that point in the story ( not quite so in the movie , is it ? ) . This problem is compacted by the fact that Charlotte can rattle off two definitions for ' Humble ' but can't think of a single word to describe Wilbur without having Templeton find a piece of paper with writing on it . Another thing that really bothered me was the way the relationship between Fern and Henry Fussy ultimately played out . This was one of the questionable things in the original novel , and not only is this romantic relationship between these two 8-year-olds not subdued in the movie version , it is enhanced . Henry shows up at the fair near the end of the movie ( looking startlingly different from the last time that he is shown ) , and Fern winks at him , he tells her that he has some money and wants to take her on the Ferris-wheel , and they leave hand in hand , talking like 16-year-olds rather than the 8-year-olds that they are . Wilbur then cries to Charlotte that Fern didn't even say goodbye to him when she left , and Charlotte reassures him by telling him that Fern will always love him , but that ' She's growing up . She's suddenly seeing Henry Fussy with new eyes . ' Suddenly is right ! There are a few very important lines from the original story that are placed directly into the movie , such as Fern complaining about the injustice of Wilbur being killed for being small at the beginning , and the very last line of the movie , about Charlotte being both a good friend and a good writer , but this only begins to make up for the things that were added or changed in the movie . The usual musical numbers that are found in every animated Disney movie regardless of content are here , and they aren't ALL completely cutesy and contrived ( although Wilbur's ' I Can Talk ' song is unforgivable ) , but they are definitely typical Disney fodder . The structure of the story is here , but there are some very important things that are changed for the benefit of being a Disney movie . This is , after all , a DISNEY adaptation of a children's literary classic . No less , and , most importantly , no more .
Poor Kid Rock .	A movie like The Adventures of Joe Dirt is not the kind of movie that is going to trick you into thinking that it is something worth watching , the way movies like Armageddon try to . David Spade is almost universally associated with low thought comedies , but like Joe Dirt , these are not always all bad . Joe Dirt is the type of movie that comes across as a goofball comedy that is not likely to be very believable and certainly will not promote much cognitive activity , but I respect it because there is a place in the entertainment industry for movies like Joe Dirt . There is a place for bad comedy in the movies , and the reason that I don't hold Joe Dirt's status as a bad comedy against it is because it doesn't try to be anything else . There are so many movies these days that could so easily have slipped comfortably in with this country's truly great films had it not been for the addition of stupid , stupid love stories or idiot comic relief ( a glaring recent example being Pearl Harbor ) that it's refreshing to see one come along every once in a while that knows where it stands . That being said , I would like to also point out that I certainly have little to no respect for Joe Dirt outside of knowing its place . It is a comedy full of bad jokes that either are looking for a cheap laugh or , in a disturbing amount of occasions , are making jokes about things that really shouldn't be joked about . The movie is about a guy named Joe Dirt who is proudly the most redneck person you could ever hope to meet , whose parents abandoned him at the Grand Canyon when he was 8 years old . It is not that easy in this country for an 8 year old to get through life on his own , but mostly because it would not be too long before he was picked off the streets by a shelter or the police or any number of institutions . I doubt that he lived in the woods until he was old enough to pretend he had enough of an address to get a job , although that would certainly account for many things about his appearance and demeanor . After being noticed by a radio show that badly needed some sucker to laugh at for a few hours , Joe gets a spot on the radio show talking about his life , which at first starts out as a hilarious joke for the DJ ( Dennis Miller ) , but ends up capturing the heart of the DJ and the audience and earning Joe several more days of air time to tell his story . He talks of when he went out in search of his real parents , leaving us already aware that he didn't find them or didn't care to know them once he had met them ( given the fact that he still seemed pretty parentless ) , at first accurately portraying what a pathetic person he is , but ultimately his struggle becomes apparent and he starts to come across as some weird sort of tragic hero . Well , a goofy comedy's version of a tragic hero , anyway . As has been one of Spade's most prevalent skills throughout his career , in Joe Dirt he capitalizes on his weaknesses , making us laugh at how pathetic Joe Dirt is and , at the same time , how easily Spade can portray this kind of person . Kid Rock has a bit part as anther redneck who is trying to steal away from Dirt a stunningly attractive blonde who has probably the most inexplicable attraction to any person in any film in the last 20 or 30 years . This might be considered the point in the film where it switches from the realm of mil romantic comedy and goes full force into the world of science fiction , fantasy , and horror . Kid Rock plays a character that he is familiar with in real life , a tire-squealing redneck with little to no education and the total conviction that he is the coolest thing on earth . Unfortunately , by playing this character , he emphasizes the already prevalent detail that his taking a role in this film is an obvious attempt to switch over to acting and away from his flailing musical career . Overall , Joe Dirt has it positive moments . There were parts of the movie that were genuinely amusing ( although not very many at all ) , but unfortunately there were also an enormous amount of parts that were supposed to be funny but were not even by the furthest stretch of the imagination ( such as anything involving septic tanks shaped like missiles and buried mysteriously in the desert or anything about Joe's exposed brain ) . Someone thought , for example , that it would be amusing to have Joe Dirt say that he was born without the top of his skull , with his brain exposed , which completely mystifies me . This is a completely backwards step in developing the character of Joe Dirt ( who they are trying to present as a normal guy underneath his astonishingly dorky exterior ) , and more importantly , it's not at all amusing , it's a horrible way to try to generate gross out humor . Maybe the writers forgot that people in real life are born like that . Maybe Joe , unlike the writers , sacrificed the top of his skull at birth for some sort of care for his fellow human being , and on top of that ( no pun intended , of course ) , they throw in a hideous mullet wig that Joe has miraculously worn all his life . So let's recap , Joe Dirt was born without the top of his skull , he was fitted with the most repulsive wig that must have fallen out of the 1970s , he was abandoned by his parents at the age of eight , and now spends his life mopping floors and being laughed at by anyone he comes into contact with ( including us ) . When you consider the human side of the movie , the comedy drains away , which is ironic since the human side is exactly the part of Joe Dirt that the movie tries to bring to light . Joe eventually finds his parents , only to discover from them within a matter of minutes and while surrounded by TV cameras that okay , okay , they left him at the Grand Canyon on purpose , leaving us with the feeling that the last hour and a half was a complete waste and the feeling that , had the writers not so obviously been complete morons , Joe Dirt really had the chance to have been a worthwhile comedy . A slim chance , but a chance nonetheless .
Mainstream ?	Strangely enough , I read a review of one IMDb user who asserted that Once Bitten is one of Jim Carrey's best performances since going mainstream . I'm curious as to what this user means by that statement , because Once Bitten was YEARS before Carrey went mainstream . Is this person saying that Carrey's performance here is better than his performances years later , when he did , in fact , get into mainstream films ? If so , I beg to differ . And if not , I still beg to differ . The first thing that struck me about Once Bitten is that it is a teen sex comedy , which is not something that I ever associated with Jim Carrey ( not the least reason for which is because most of his better know movies are not only above such childish comedy but were made long after his teenage years were over ) . Even in Once Bitten he was about 23 years old , but the movie focuses on his inability to communicate very effectively with women , much less pull off any successful sexual encounters . Enter a vampire , surprisingly sexy for her 400 years , who must feed on three virgins or cease to exist . All desperate high school guy in the 80s should have been so lucky . The premise is ridiculous , comparable to those bad movies that feature things like strippers that turn into aliens , or other monsters that feed on humans by taking on the form of sexy naked women in order to seduce men . Where the movie goes right is in the two main characters , Lauren Hutton as the vampiress trying to feed on Mark Kendall , to whom Jim Carrey brings a surprisingly effective level of insecurity and awkward appeal . Carrey obviously remembers similar developmental difficulties in his own youth . Mark's two friends , the obligatory sex-starved geeks who bounce crude humor off of each other , are negligible , put into the movie for no other reason than for some vampire snacks and to have someone for Mark to complain to about his nervousness about sex , while they confidently give him all kinds of advice , momentarily forgetting that they share in at least his same level of cluelessness on the subject . While earlier , and dumber , sex comedies like Porky's made no attempt to be more than they are , dumb sex comedies , Once Bitten successfully tries to present a sort of lesson about the dangers of promiscuity , while at the same time failing ultimately because it tries to be too much than its material allows . Rather than seeking the old jugular , this vampiress prefers to drink from a more southerly location , providing a pretty ham-handed allegory of sexually transmitted diseases . Carrey has been prowling dingy bars in search of an easy first time ( in response to his lack of success with an un-promiscuous girlfriend ) , and ends up placing in grave danger the very parts that he is trying to get some much needed attention . There is a sad story behind the writing of the screenplay . David Hines , a college student desperately avoiding real life , took endless art classes to postpone graduation , and ultimately dropped out when it seemed that his screenplay for Once Bitten , at the time titled Nightlife , seemed to be taking off . The movie was put into production , produced , released , and then six months later sat on the shelves at Sam Goody , where Hines worked as a lowly entry level employee , constantly teased by his coworkers over the spectacular failure of his movie . I really can't say that I found it to be THAT bad , but again , this could be just because I'm a huge fan of Jim Carrey . Maybe the movie was just overshadowed by Fright Night ( also not great but better than Once Bitten ) , released the same year , and The Lost Boys ( vastly superior to both ) , released two years later . Either way , Once Bitten is hardly an underrated gem . The film itself is pretty dismal , but it remains interesting even if for no other reason than because you can so clearly see the budding elements of what would later become Jim Carrey trademarks . Not just his over-the-top comedy performances , but also even slight hints at his more dramatic roles , like when he goes to the Halloween party and is exasperated that he keeps having to explain that he's not dressed as a vampire , he's not even wearing a costume . It's a cheesy teen sex comedy , but Carrey makes it interesting , at least some parts . It's just too bad that he had to develop more of a career before people cared .
Get drunk first .	There are several classic comedies that , at the time of this writing , I've never seen , like Animal House , Groundhog Day , and , until yesterday , Caddyshack . Maybe I just expected more , but I found Caddyshack to be pretty disappointing . The only funny people in the movie are Chevy Chase and Rodney Dangerfield , and the latter only sporadically . Rodney Dangerfield has this style of comedy that is brilliant in stand-up , but in a film it is not very conducive to repeat viewings . His style is too spontaneous to be funny more than once or twice , but was still funnier in this movie by leaps and bounds than Bill Murray , who turned in an astonishingly unamusing performance . A lot of times I find myself unable to sufficiently appreciate these goofball comedies , because when they reach the level of cult classic that this movie has , I really expect them to be side-splittingly hilarious , which Caddyshack simply is not . On the other hand , I think my sense of humor has matured beyond the ability to fully appreciate the crude humor for which 80s comedies are often so well known , so maybe I'm wrong ( note : I'm not wrong ) . Structurally , the movie is very well made . When it ultimately gets around to the real conflict in the movie rather than concentrating on the stupid clash between the drunken teen caddies and the snooty rich folk that populate the curiously named Bushwood Country Club , there is some genuine tension created . Bill Murray plays a groundskeeper caricature ( replacing groundskeeper Willie , who showed up in the beginning of the movie and then promptly and inexplicably disappeared completely ) who is assigned by the club's owner to get rid of the gophers that have somehow made it onto the golf course and proceeded to tear huge ruts into the putting greens . Murray's role for the rest of the movie is to plot huge military vengeance against the offending gopher , who really only wants to listen to good music and get his groove on . I'm not sure whose talent is more wasted , Murray's or the gopher's . I've found recently that watching any documentaries provided with the DVDs almost invariably makes me appreciate the movie more . I liked this movie much more after I watched the cast and crew talking about their experiences in making it , much as my appreciation was lifted by similar documentaries for movies like Willard and Texas Chainsaw III , which had nowhere to go but up anyway . What I can't get over , though , is how funny Caddyshack is not . It's not that the comedy flew below my radar , so to speak , but that there is really not much effort put into making it funny . If the making-of documentary is to be believed ( although I have a feeling that this was said as a joke ) , the screenplay was originally intended to be a drama , but not much of what was in the script ever made it into the final film . If that's true , my theory is that it was the dancing mechanical gopher that turned it from a drama into a comedy . Whatever the case , Caddyshack turned out to be one of the most famous comedies ever made , although in my opinion , not even close to one of the best .
Did you read the book ?	And yes , Mr . Baxley , I'm talking to you . You of all people should have read the book . You did , after all , direct the movie . Before I go on , I should tell you that I actually found Craig Baxley's film rendering of Stephen King's novel to be very entertaining , even though it took place almost a century after the book took place , dealing with almost nothing from the novel . But that's okay , they made a prequel for that . This movie is about a professor who just about stakes her career , and definitely her reputation , on her ability to find actual paranormal phenomena going on at the legendary Rose Red , a big bad haunted house . Rose Red is certainly a bad house . We get enough of the history of the mansion to know that it's a bad house . It seems to actually be alive and in control of its own body , altering its construction and adding entire new wings at will . You might say it's Sarah Winchester and the Winchester Mystery House combined . The story was , obviously , based on the San Jose mansion and almost filmed there . The idea was scrapped for whatever reason , and filmed in Tacoma instead , not that it matters , I suppose , since whatever mansion they used would probably have been augmented tremendously with visual effects anyway . The story concerns the above-mentioned professor bringing together an entire team of what you might call high profile paranormal phenomena experts , some more willing to attend than others , in the hopes that with such a collection of extra-perceptual abilities she might increase her chances of conjuring up genuine paranormal activity in the mansion and thus resuscitate her reputation and perhaps even generate national recognition . As is to be expected , a rival professor has sent along a spy to bring down her plans . So far so good , I guess . This is the premise for what could be a good haunted house movie , but the two most pressing problems are that a haunted house movie has a long haul ahead of it in order to achieve something innovative , and the other problem is that this is not what the book is about upon which the miniseries is based . I suppose that little detail can be overlooked , since the miniseries focuses on the future as a haunted house of the mansion in King's novel , but the movie really has to justify that leap , and this one really doesn'tThe made-for-TV effects are painfully obvious , mostly all of the visual effects and even the very filming itself having that flat and somehow too smooth quality that I can never figure out how but always reveals how cheap it is . And maybe I'm wrong , maybe it's not even cheap , just made for a different medium , but my problem is that it is not nearly as convincing as effects made for the movies . As far as the characters , it's strange that the one who I think is the most widely disliked is probably the only interesting one among the lot of them . Emery Waterman , played by Matt Ross , is the slightly overweight loser stereotype of the group , constantly mumbling and grumbling and complaining and with an overbearing mother and speaking in an almost painfully irritating voice , but at least his character has depth . Not many of the others do . Stephen King himself turns up once , as he does in just about all of the movies based on his work ( my personal favorite is his hilarious cameo in Maximum Overdrive ) , here , as always , playing the tiny part of a character that comes on screen just long enough to get treated badly and then shunned . King's humility is enviable and virtually nonexistent in Hollywood these days . Rose Red , another of Stephen King's lengthy made-for-tv movies , sure to be enjoyed by devoted Stephen King fans , although it's strange that I am a devoted King fan myself and was a little disappointed . I think , however , that I was mainly disappointed because the movie strayed so far from what the book was about , but in retrospect I kind of can appreciate the extra level that that adds to the content of the story . Besides sort of removing from the book and showing the haunted mansion far in the future from the time during which the book takes place , it also creates the possibility of a prequel . It's like they made Rose Red and Rose Red II ( The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer ) in reverse order . I guess you could say that's pretty clever , I guess , bur unfortunately it's among the more clever things about either film . I expected more from Stephen King , who has of late evolved from the cheesy horror films that were adapted from his books ( such as abysmal films like Graveyard Shift and Creepshow ) to intelligent and often amazingly high-quality films like The Shawshank Redemption and Hearts In Atlantis . Rose Red falls just a bit above one of his latest flops , Dreamcatcher . Hopefully his next miniseries , Desperation , will be better . I certainly have high hopes for The Talisman and especially Bag of Bones .
Seagal bleeds his own blood for the first time !	OK , so the IMDb plot synopsis describes Seagal's character Jack Cole as a " soft spoken , mystical , new age New York cop with a checkered past . " So basically that's Seagal playing himself again , except for the New York cop part ? He's been transferred from New York to LA to help the LAPD with the case of a serial killer who has been dubbed " the family man , " due to the fact that he has a tendency to kill whole families . Generally the killer has a very specific method , and the killings that have taken place since Cole came to LA have seemed a little different to him . And since he's Steven Seagal , of course it needs to be personal . Because like it or not , ole ' Steve's just good at revenge , man . The latest murder is Cole's ex-wife and her new husband , so he is brought almost miraculously into a personal involvement in the case ( that he came from New York to help find a serial killer and then that killer managed to kill his ex-wife is what I call a Movie Miracle ) , but luckily his partnership with LA Detective Jim Campbell is interesting an amusing enough to carry us past such small snags . Ad by the way , Campbell is played by Keenan Ivory Wayans who , you may have noticed , is one of the Wayans brothers , but don't let that deter you . He does manage to give a less impressive performance that Seagal in the movie but is leaps and bounds better than his idiot brothers tend to be . At the very least , when he's involved with train wreck movies like White Chicks and Little Man , at least he has the good sense to hide his face . If you ever see Marlon's name anywhere , however , run for the hills ! Of course , in The Glimmer Man , Detective Campbell's only role is to make the LAPD seem at first to be the hardcore precinct , and then immediately afterwards he transforms into nothing but comic relief . And not that he's bad at it . It was moderately amusing when he stumbled across " powdered deer penis " in a Chinese herb store while Taft was at the counter stumbling through some broken Chinese with the store clerks , but I've lived here in China for two years now and I've never seen anyone eat nor have heard anything about anyone eating deer penis , powdered or otherwise . On the other hand , sheep penis is a different story . I've had that myself . It was one of my Chinese friends who explained to me that " the Chinese eat everything that runs along the ground except cars , and everything that flies in the sky except airplanes . " In fact , by far my favorite late night food ( meaning around 4am after a long night of bar-hopping ) is barbecued sheep testicles and eyeballs at a location that my friends and I have lovingly dubbed " the dirty street . " I know it sounds frightening but trust me , those eyeballs are DELICIOUS . Can I just make one suggestion though ? If you ever find yourself with the opportunity to eat sparrow , make sure to eat the head first . It's a small bird , so they serve it with everything but the feathers , and you eat everything , too . Claws , bones , beak , everything . But if you save the head for last , like I did , then by the time you bite into the skull you get cold brains squirting into your mouth , and trust me , that's even a little worse than it sounds ? So anyway , while tracking the serial killer , it seems that Cole's old boss , played with satisfactory menace by Michael Cox ( who you may remember as the movie world's first Hannibal Lecter ) is attempting to enter into a shady deal with the Russians to get super-rich off the black market sales of chemical weapons . Needless to say , Cole comes off as a little nuts when he , the new guy , starts trying to convince people that there is a high-level conspiracy going on involving the Russians . Not a good way to make a first impression . There are some good action sequences ( if not exactly original ) and enough fight scenes to satisfy the Seagal fans ( who will admittedly make up most of the audience , except the film critics who warn everyone else away ) , although it's all made a little goofy by the fact that Lieutenant Cole , at one point , explains that violence is against his religion . Yeah , right . The buddy-cop angle is a clever addition to the Seagal formula and has spotty success here , but the majority of people of course are going to find it a disappointing action movie unless they're a die-hard Seagal fan . Personally , I happen to believe that movies from people like Steven Seagal and Jean Claude Van-Damme speak to a certain adolescent childishness in us that should never really be completely forgotten . No , they're not Oscar winners , nor will they ever be . But if you can't find at least a little fun in some of them , you might think about lightening up a little bit !
Picking up almost exactly where part I left off , Hellraiser II , although also not a great movie in any respect , continues the unlikely but strangely fascinating story started by the original Hellraiser in 19	Hellraiser II , like the rest of the series , requires an extreme suspension of disbelief . Obviously , horror movies are not meant to portray reality , but there was not a single solitary piece of the real world presented here . Not for even one second of film time did anything resembling real life show up in the movie , and this took a lot away from the film's potential . Think about how much more effective the film would have been had Kirsty Cotton ( Ashley Laurence , in her second ridiculous performance in this series alone ) been kept in a psychiatric hospital that even remotely resembled even the most dismal hospital in the real world . I would have been much more interested had she been placed in an atmosphere of normality , beyond which she knows the hellish creatures that are the Cenobites lurk . I mean , a hospital that doesn't seem to have electricity , that has a violent ward that looks more like a medieval torture chamber , and that allows patients to roam the halls doesn't do justice to the film's personality . What this type of thing does is give the entire film a creepy mood , and takes away from the effectiveness of the parts of the film that are really meant to be scary . There just wasn't much creativity in the movie's presentation . Kirsty , a PATIENT in the hospital , wanders down the darkened hall one evening , and she comes upon the room of Tiffany who , as Kirsty's doctor explains to her after finding her ( rather than taking her back to her own room ) , is a complete mystery because she never speaks . She just sits around and solves puzzles ( like little wooden boxes ! ! Kirsty didn't seem bothered by that little detail ? ) . Also , did anybody ever figure out why the hell she touched the blood from her wall ( ' ? I am in Hell help me ? ' ) to her LIPS ? ! Maybe she really does belong in the psych ward . Hellraiser II goes more in depth into some of the things that were presented in part I . For example , the film starts off with a quick scene showing Pinhead's creation , and the film also takes the audience into the world of the Cenobites . It gives an idea of where they come from and how they are made . It is this element of the film that saves it from absolute failure . The script was awful ( ' You have got to destroy that mattress ! You have GOT to destroy that mattress ! ! ' Or how about this , my favorite , ' Kyle , when I think , I hurt . ' That's brilliant , Kirsty ) , the atmosphere was entirely overdone , and the directing was unimaginative and routine . Kirsty and Kyle , her ? doctor , ' momentarily develop a hint of a ridiculous romance , and the film was packed with careless mistakes ( like the fact that , after Julia eats enough women to get her skin back , Dr . Channard cuts her bandages off and she has MAKEUP on . I guess it must have come with the skin ? ) . Then there were trivial things like when Ashley and Tiffany ( whose real name we never learn ) , barely escape one of those Hell tunnels into a room and there are two beams of light showing on the wall , having come through the window . What's this , two suns ? At any rate , the movie itself was clumsily put together , but luckily it went into detail about the things that made the equally poor original so successful . The Cenobites , ironically enough , are given a more human side , and even the thoroughly evil Pinhead shows a bit of compassion at the end of the film ( a lot of good it does him ? ) . The best element of Hellraiser II , like part I , was the convincing makeup done on the skinless people . There were some intricate details there , and the desired gross-out reaction is pretty successfully attained . Some scenes were actually painful to watch ( remember that poor nutcase who tried to get the maggots off himself with the straight razor ? ) , which I think is a mark of at least limited success for this type of horror film . If you are a horror fan , the entire Hellraiser series is obviously mandatory viewing , but I think that other people , before you immediately dismiss the Hellraiser films as complete wastes of time , should realize that they are not meant to be mainstream films . These are made for people who are into this kind of splatter film , and as a splatter film it succeeds on many levels . It creates fascinating characters ( the Cenobites , not the numbingly boring humans ) , tells an unlikely but interesting story about their interaction with the living world , and never fails to throw in buckets and buckets of blood and gore . I'm a pretty devoted horror fan myself , but even though I regard Pinhead as the best villain ever created in film , Hellraiser II ( as well as the rest of them ) was so flawed that I cannot hail this as a great or even a really good film . It's good horror and it's fun to watch , but it probably won't go down in history as a classic horror movie .
Disappointing .	The thing that really makes a good family film is when it appeals to both children and adults . For example , you have Toy Story , Toy Story 2 , Shrek , The Iron Giant , and even , surprisingly enough , lots and lots of Disney films . Unfortunately , the whole thing about technologically advanced domesticated animals who are also experts at tactical warfare is just too silly to be entertaining . It was fun to a degree , but when you see cats parachuting with night vision goggles or that damn underground subway system that the dogs somehow built , it goes too far . In one of Gallagher's stand-up comedy videos ( Stuck In The 60s , I believe ) , he is making fun of those rugs that show a picture of dogs shooting pool or cats playing poker , and he quips , ' You can't get a cat to sht in a box , you don't want him to ante in at your table . ' I wish I could see his reaction to the behavior of the cats and dogs in this movie ! I'm sure that Cats & Dogs is a fun movie for a much younger audience , but the scope of the film is so narrow that it can only really be enjoyed by kids . The movie was obviously not made by cat people , by the way , because of the fact that the cats are obviously the evil antagonists in the film , so if you have and love a cat or two in your household , it may be a good idea not to rent this one for your kids . There is some amusing dialogue and an interesting subplot involving Jeff Goldblum's attempt to come up with a serum to eliminate allergic reactions to dogs , but as a whole , Cats & Dogs just about falls flat .
A drunken Charlie trying to get to bed ?	Chaplin playing drunk characters are his weakest roles , and for much of the time I was watching One A . M . I got the feeling that he went in to work and didn't have any ideas , so just decided to play a drunk guy coming home from a big night on the town . The plot is virtually nonexistent , it really does start with him coming home drunk , and his only purpose from beginning to end is to get upstairs and go to bed . He stumbles out of a taxi and , after accidentally paying the driver with a cigarette butt instead of the fifty cent fare , he climbs through a window to get into his house , stepping in the fishbowl on the way in . There is a series of mildly amusing sight gags involving things like an extremely slippery throw rug , a spinning table ( which was one of the more amusing gags , despite making no sense at all ) , a stuffed cougar ( or some other scary animal of the cat family ) , a coat rack , and a staircase with some insufficiently attached carpeting . The set that the movie is filmed on is a little strange , with two staircases on either side , both leading up to the second floor , which apparently contains just one door to the bedroom and a clock with a wildly over-sized pendulum . I'm struck by how unrealistic the set is , with those two staircases ( it seems like something Sarah Winchester would build in her house ) , but then again , that clock's pendulum swings long and fast , directly across the path of the door to the bedroom , so it's clear that the set was designed with physical comedy in mind , not architectural efficiency . Chaplin does , after all , ultimately decide to climb that coat rack , twice , rather than use either of the staircases . The best part of the movie , however , is definitely the bed , which Charlie has to deal with when he eventually does make it upstairs . The mechanics of the bed make no sense at all , as it flips around every which way and seems to have a personality of it's own . And apparently it doesn't like being slept on ! There is an interesting contraption at the end that I found a little curious . There's a thing that looks like a ladder in the bathroom , but it turns out that it's a shower that sprays water out of all of the rungs . I wonder if this was kind of a new and innovative showering idea that just never really caught on . At any rate , after losing his battle with the bed , Charlie ultimately falls asleep in the bathtub and the movie ends . It's a clever little comedy , but it's basically just physical comedy and nothing else . Even back in 1916 Chaplin was making much better films than this .
Classic that has lost all potency as a horror film , but should be respected because the reason that it has lost all potency is because it started so many trends that it has been endlessly duplicated and , hen	Friday the 13th is one of the most recognizable horror movie titles in movie history , but is not the same powerful film that it was in 1980 . It has been ripped off to no end , leaving it little more than a brittle skeleton of its original self , but it was also a rip off of Halloween , so I suppose in a way it has gotten what it deserves . It is a very basic horror film and has been since the day it was released , where a lot of teenagers go out to some remote location , ignore every possibly sign of danger , and start getting killed in the same order that they start getting naked . It is a curious phenomenon that so many horror films seem determined to punish promiscuity as brutally as possible . Maybe the directors are insecure about their daughters or something . Today , the film has been reduced to little more than a curiosity piece for horror movie fans , but also fills the important slot as the original film in one of the largest horror series ' of all time . Maybe even one of the best , at least considering the fact that most of its competitors are just as bad after the original film . I haven't seen Jason X yet , and have been going back to watch all of the older ones so that I can see it in the right order , but I thought it might be interesting to watch the original film and then watch Jason X right afterward , just to see how far the series has come ( or to see how far the special effects have come , at least . My expectations for Jason X are pretty abysmal ) . As far as being entertaining , I don't think that Friday the 13th has suffered too much , although it has turned into an entirely different kind of entertainment than when it was first released as a horror film . Normally when a horror film comes off as funny , it is a sign of the film's failure , but I don't consider the hilarity of the original Friday the 13th as a mark against it at all as much as a sign of the durability of the film . If it can't scare you anymore , it will entertain you in any way it can . You don't watch a film like the original Friday the 13th to get scared , you watch it to laugh at how stupid teenagers can be , you watch it to wonder if your parents really played such astronomically moronic games as strip Monopoly in the woods in the pouring rain , and more than anything else , you watch it to see a young Kevin Bacon frolic around in some tiny jean shorts . It has not withstood the test of time very well at all , but the film is most certainly a survivor .
In 2003 , the digital effects team behind Independence Day made a worse movie than this one .	I had a pretty positive reaction to this movie , although my opinion is surely biased because I saw it a couple days after watching the 2003 film Coronado and I was still reeling at how staggeringly bad that movie was . Unbelievable , seriously . I'm not going to get over that shock for quite a while , actually . The Giant Gila Monster is an example of a classic b-monster movie with ridiculous dialogue and dismal special effects that still manages to be entertaining . A lot of reviewers have had a lot of really negative things to say about it , which I'm trying to avoid because it's really easy to badmouth a movie like this . I bought a collection of 50 classic horror films and this one was included and , on the inside flap of the box is the following line , presumably meant to generate excitement in seeing the movie , " Marvel at the primitive special effects in Giant Gila Monster ! " This is partly why I try to avoid bashing the movie too much , because it came in a collection of movies called " 50 Horror Classics , " which also includes such gems as Attack of the Giant Leeches , The Killer Shrews ( which was originally released as a double feature with The Giant Gila Monster ) , Swamp Women , and The Amazing Mr . X . Surely I was not expecting a milestone film when I watched this movie , although it should be noted that the collection also features films like Nosferatu , Night of the Living Dead , House on Haunted Hill , Metropolis , The Phantom of the Opera , The Hunchback of Notre Dame , and White Zombie ( which I have yet to watch , but with a title like that it HAS to be good ) . The premise of the movie is that there is so much uncharted land around some suburban town that a monstrous lizard has been living there unnoticed for years . The movie starts out showing normal daily life of a lot of teenagers acting like I assume teenagers really acted back then ( if someone tried it these days , however , they would have to have their wedgies surgically removed ) , until strange things start happening in the form of lots of car crashes that involve skidmarks perpendicular to the direction of travel , resulting in the big question , " What batters a car around like it was a toy ? " For most of the movie the cast dances around the possibility of any unusual life forms until the father of a boy who went missing early in the film insists that there could be a huge lizard out there , giving reasoning which makes absolutely no sense at all . He insists that a giant lizard could easily live out there for years unnoticed , get this , in the " underbrush . " Well , maybe he just didn't understand the scale he was talking about , because given the size of the car that crashes into it at the end of the film , this lizard living in " underbrush " was probably a good 60 feet long . But even without having seen the thing , is " underbrush " the kind place where something big enough to push cars sideways could hide ? The size of the lizard , first of all , is blamed on out of control pituitary growth , then soon afterwards there's something about some river delta country where salts washed into the valley and got absorbed by the plants and then transferred to the animal , causing them to be giant . I don't know if the intention was to throw in some scientific processes and quickly confuse the audience , but I really can't say that I've heard of any salts that cause gigantism . But I'm no scientist , so what do I know . At any rate , yes the special effects are primitive , but so is the movie . This is a special effects film that was made on a tiny budget more than four decades ago , so I'm willing to cut a little slack . The gila monster is never convincing even for a second , but at least there was some genuine thought put into the characters and the script . One of the biggest signposts of low budget science fiction and horror is when you can't tell how big the monster is , but remember that that is a sign of low budget , not low quality . I like to think that The Gian Gila Monster has at least some quality . The movie , for example , contains at least one clever line of dialogue ( " I ask you what time it is and you tell me how to build a clock , just answer the question ! " ) and the singing that one of the main characters is always doing ( as well as his disabled daughter ) were genuine , and successful , in my opinion , efforts at creating three-dimensional characters , which is not something that you see often in these old monster movies . Or new monster movies , as it were . Again , I may be being overly tolerant of this movie because I watched Coronado recently and I remain blown away at how god-awful it was , but while The Giant Gila Monster will never become a classic of any kind ( no matter what kind of movie collection it is included with ) , it is certainly not as bad as so many people would have
Here's a revealing statement , the goofy romance portion of this goofy romantic comedy is probably it's best part .	Now , that's a loaded sentence , if I've ever written one . Ben Affleck's and Jennifer Lopez's relationship is probably the most asinine and nauseating one discussed by supermarket tabloids since Carmen Electra and Dennis Rodman , and yet their romantic relationship in this prescribed failure of a romantic comedy is the most successful part of the whole movie . Keep in mind that you can take that a couple of ways . It could mean that it was done so well that it overshadows the rest of the movie , or it could mean that the rest of the movie is so bad that even the boring romance between these two people was better than everything else . That's all in the eye of the beholder , I guess , but for myself , I have to say that the necessity to watch the entire movie from beginning to end in order for it to be analyzed fairly is unfortunate . If you don't love hearing endlessly about Ben and J-Lo , you may very well have a hard time sitting through this one . For some reason that I don't pretend to understand , Ben and J-Lo each play hardened gangsters in Gigli ( named after Affleck's character , who in turn is named such for no apparent reason ) , with Gigli a slightly younger and cockier thug while Ricki ( Lopez ) is sent along to keep an eye on him . You see , he's been assigned to the kidnapping of the mentally deficient younger brother of a federal prosecutor in the interest of preventing a deserved conviction . This part of the story I won't go into much , since it plays no role in the movie except to have a wispy string of plot along which to string lots of cute scenes with Ben , Jennifer , and , as Gigli charmingly calls him , ' the retard . ' The criminal plot in this movie is completely meaningless , it bobs it's ugly head above the surface briefly every 20 minutes or so just to remind you that it's there , and then disappears so Ben and Jennifer and argue over the superiorities of their respective genitalia . The reason that I say that the romance is the best part of the movie is because this is a film that follows every standard cliché which should lead up to the typical odd-couple forced together by their work , so completely different that they can hardly stand each other , only to grow on and toward each other and ultimately reach some sweet , happy middle ground so they can kiss at the end with the sunset in the background while the orchestra picks up . But the reason that they have an extensive discussion of their genitals is because of Gigli's desperation to prove to Ricki , who makes it clear to him that she's a lesbian ( and eventually , the audience learns that it's true , she's not pretending just because his first advance on her was so jaw-droppingly idiotic ) that she has been missing out on the sheer wonders of the penis . This is a remarkably cleverly written scene , but whether you are male or female , gay or straight , you have to admit that it's hard to look past the fact ( and I use the word fact purposely ) that this is a scene with no other purpose but to have J-Lo gyrate and twist her body for the benefit of the passing camera , ending it with two words and a position that will have everyone in the room sweating . Now , I can hardly complain about this scene , except when you remember that these people are gangsters who have the kidnapped mentally retarded brother of a top federal prosecutor just in the other room ( conveniently leaving them alone whenever the script doesn't need him around ) . The ability of the characters to forget what they're doing for extended periods of time is remarkable . So like I mentioned earlier , the crime portion of this movie is completely pointless except for three things - lots of cute scenes with the three main characters ( I should say the one main character , played by Justin Bartha , and the two supporting characters , Ben and Jen ) , the cameo from Christopher Walken , and the cameo from Al Pacino , both of which are so good that they diminish the rest of the film beneath the weight of their presence . Not that there's much to diminish . You can tell how much thought was put into the film by such things as the fact that Affleck's character has a weird name literally for absolutely no other reason than to provide him a couple of opportunities to explain how to pronounce it ( ' It rhymes with ' really . . . ' ) . Kind of like how that idiot show on MTV Sorority Life derived much of its conflict ( at least in the first episode , I could stand no more after that one ) from the very fact that it was being filmed , Gigli is evidently named just so that the pronunciation will have to be explained . In glancing over the page on the IMDb for Gigli , I've noticed that it has earned itself a place near the top of the bottom 100 films of all time list . Not surprising , although I would not have expected that , even though I knew the film was a critical and popular disaster . Personally , I rated it a , because while the film failed in everything it set out to do , it had some ( 2 ) wonderful cameos from some ( 2 ) wonderful actors , and there were also some genuinely amusing scenes involving Brian , the mentally retarded subject of the botched abduction . One scene , for example , featured Brian singing a song by Sir-Mix-A-Lot , which need not be named , since that guy only recorded one song , didn't he ? Anyway , this scene is NOT one of the amusing ones . Not in the slightest . Who it was that came up with this little brainstorm and thought it might be funny I can not IMAGINE , but some of the other scenes were definitely amusing . See the scene at the end ( unfortunately , you have to make it that far ) , where he first hears the voice of the girl he's about to dance with . The look on his face is priceless . I firmly believe that it's important to watch the really bad movies in order to truly appreciate the really good ones , and it's no secret that Gigli is definitely one of the bad ones . But there are different kinds of bad ones , there are bad movies like old horror films that have inadvertently transformed into comedies ( many of these are sequels to relatively successful films , like Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street ) , there are movies that are made by immature idiots that take bad taste to unimaginably abysmal depths ( such as the Scary Movies - this is the worst type of bad movie , by the way ) , and there are bad movies like the kind that you want to watch just because they are so famously awful that it's entertaining in itself to watch them just to see how bad they are . These are almost like feature-length sequences of outtakes . Battlefield Earth is , of course , at the top of this list , but also included are such crapfests as From Justin to Kelly and , of course , Gigli . That being said , I can't say that I would totally deter you from watching Gigli . It's entertaining , but before you watch it , keep in mind that it's exactly like David Spade - the only entertaining things about it are its weaknesses .
This was an interesting enough story , and even a bit informative , but it seemed to be lacking in its completeness . . .	What you have in Pirates of Silicon Valley is a basic skeletal structure of the formation of Apple Computers and the gigantic Microsoft corporation , but it's not a very detailed account . Sure , it follows the creators from high school age , but the film structure is very blocky and it jumps around a lot . We get no hint about why the names Apple and Microsoft were chosen ( a trivial point , yes , but it would have been a good thing to put in a film about the history of those two companies ) . Also , late in the film the time gets a little confusing . The year is always noted on the bottom of the screen , but the story jumps sporadically from year to year . When you don't jump ahead in time for a while , you begin to lose track of what year you're in . You think you're looking at the early eighties , but the late 90s model Ford Broncos in the background can be very confusing . Pirates of Silicon Valley was a fairly informative look at how Apple and Microsoft came to be , and there were some very interesting looks at what the first personal computers looked like , but the film itself is not nearly as informative as it should be . A movie about one of the biggest corporations the world has ever known ( and it's president , the wealthiest man on the planet ) needs to go into a bit more detail about the subject matter that it is presenting . This film was put together fairly well , but there was just not enough effort and research put into it by the writers and producers .
In a surprisingly disappointing although basically effective action film , Tommy Lee Jones , Benecio del Toro , and the great William Friedkin all team up to prove that not even the greatest amount of star powe	The Hunted is one of those star-studded action films that generates huge amounts of anticipation just because of the people who are involved with it ( and the excellent theatrical trailers ) but is not able to live up to that anticipation . Tommy Lee Jones returns to a role that he knows all too well ( and in which we love him all too much ) , as the relentless pursuer of someone that must be caught at all costs . Benecio del Toro is the fugitive ( no pun intended ) , on the run because his violent military training has become so embedded into his mind that , as one of the men after him says , ' it has become a part of his personality . ' One question that is left unanswered is the one about whether it's true that he really can't tell the sharks from the guppies anymore . Aaron ( del Toro ) is questioned about one of his crimes , which resulted in the deaths of an apparently innocent family , whom Aaron insists were not innocent at all . It is never made very clear whether or not Aaron has really become so saturated with his training that it is the only way he can function , or if , in fact , he is still pursuing and punishing criminals . Either way , as Jones makes clear he can't be left out there running around killing people . Probably the most important thing that prevents The Hunted from becoming a great action film is the fact that there is really not much reason for it other than to make an action film . It is an exercise in making a fugitive movie in which a retired military trainer finds himself faced with the task of stopping one of his former trainees who has gone out of control and who only he can stop since he knows his tactics best . Clearly , all of the necessary ingredients are here , but the unfortunate thing is that you don't realize how little the movie has to say until you've already seen it and find yourself wondering what was the point . I don't like the idea that it was a cash-in on a premise that was sure to result in a commercially successful film , so my best guess is that it is the result of a lot of people joining together in their own most comfortable roles to make an action film . Tommy Lee Jones is more at home than anyone , but his role unfortunately is the one most likely to lead people to think the movie is an imitation . Del Toro is in a role that he is comfortable with but that entails certain psychological aspects that he does not handle very gracefully , such as the fact that Aaron is potentially psychotic . Del Toro speaks many of his lines ( consider , for example , anything that has to do with animal cruelty ) as though he's honestly doing his best ( and his best is pretty damn good ) but can't quite figure out where in his character's psyche these concerns belong . The concerns about animals , by the way , are completely unwarranted and disappear as fast as they appeared on Aaron's miniscule list of concerns about the world . You can almost see the movie seeing itself turning into a proponent of vegetarianism and then hurrying back to being a violent thriller , as though it realized who its target audience was in mid-scene . William Friedkin , director of The Exorcist and , more importantly in this case , the stunningly successful French Connection , takes on the task of sculpting this well-supplied thriller , although the brilliant chase sequences from his 1971 Best Picture do not necessarily transfer very well into this film , in which the chases are often sluggish , jerky , and ineffective . There is at least one point , when Aaron is spotted hiding under a waterfall , where the editing is done so badly that the chase jumps from the waterfall to a completely different location , as though a minute or so of the stock footage was missing . In a fast-paced chase scene like this one , a minute is a lot of time to be missing . As an action film , The Hunted works fairly well , despite being peppered with things like knife-fights which contain countless numbers of those injuries that only seem to effect the person who sustains them while blood is spurting out of them , and then they are immediately forgotten . Both characters sustain an innumerable amount of these in the final knife-fight , which is not very different from exactly the one you expected to see at the end of a movie like this , which is odd since the action is the best part of the film but even that wasn't done so well . The Hunted is not a complete waste of time , but it is something of a shell of the excellent action film that it should have been .
" Small minds breed small-minded superstitions . "	Famous for coming from the same minds as brought us the disturbingly good Saw films , Dead Silence reveals a deeper fascination ( or obsession ) with dolls than those movies initially let on . This time we have another sort of murder mystery , in the sense that we have Donnie Wahlberg as a detective investigating what seems to be an open and shut murder case , albeit an increasingly bizarre one . It takes place is the satisfactorily eerie-named Raven's Fair when a young couple mysteriously receive a frighteningly creepy ventriloquist's doll on their doorstep with no return address . As they try to figure out where it came from , the wife ends up dead and of course , the young husband the prime suspect in her murder , given that he foolishly keeps blaming the doll for her death . Not a real smart move if you want the police to give you some slack , for crying out loud . Wahlberg overdoes the incessant , cynical skepticism about lead character Jamie's story about the killer doll , especially since the movie exists in that horror movie world where even places like police stations and hospitals are either the creepiest places in the world or haven't paid their electricity bills in some months . Doesn't he realize he's in a movie ? Nonetheless , we still expect something big from these guys , after all , Saw burst onto the scene like a freight train and no one saw it coming . Now they go from that to the killer doll sub-genre , which needless to say has been done to death for decades . So we are waiting for something new and exciting and unfortunately it just isn't there . There are numerous plot points that don't make a lot of sense , despite a few rather ambitious branches of the premise , and while some of the sight gags are fairly effective and the creepy atmosphere is undeniable , they shockingly forget the critical horror movie rule that CGI shots are just not scary . I'm going to make a bold statement , there has never once in cinematic history been a horror film that made a CGI shot scary . It's never happened . If you disagree , let me know , I'd love to see it happen , but it definitely doesn't happen here , and if an old woman sticking her foot long tongue through a doll's head is not scary then I don't know what is . The death scenes themselves are effectively creepy , as they have added the little tidbit that victims tongues are torn out . Given the fact that that is one of the selling points should tell you exactly what kind of horror movie this is . Nevertheless , the scares are pretty light . The movie's tagline says , " Whatever you do , don't scream . " I don't think that will be a problem . . .
Mostly for kids , but the best version of Verne'e story ever . . .	In an effort to prove the potential truth of his long-missing brother's research and theories ( and to get along with his smart-ass nephew ) , Anderson sets off on this quest to penetrate the earth's crust through a volcano in Iceland . What follows is a remarkably faithful presentation of Verne's story , which doesn't really matter because most people will be more interested in the 3D anyway . And the 3D is impressive , by the way . We have come a long way since those red and blue sunglasses that just made everything look red and blue , the 3D here is so realistic that the obligatory jump-through-the-screen moments may cause even the most judicious of us to raise our eyebrows . Sadly , that realism is the new novelty , so the movie can't help halting in its tracks every ten minutes or so for a nice 3D wow-moment . I hate that . It should be noted that this is a family film , so don't expect high adventure or danger the likes of which you should expect to find on a journey anywhere where no one has ever been before . As a guide , I have developed a theory that , in a movie like this , the character who doesn't know anything ( Sean , the nephew ) , is about the age of the target audience , because he is the one that needs to have everything explained to him , for the audience's benefit . Sean is 13 . There is , however , an immediate and crippling discrepancy with the story . Before anything happens resembling any journey anywhere , we get a Toyota Prius commercial , a PSP commercial , plugs for Mountain Dew , Tivo , Family Guy , and Iceland Airlines , and the strange revelations that a PSP can " Google at 30 , 000 feet " and a punk teenager can receive calls on his cell phone while trapped miles below the earth's surface . That's news to me ! The problem is that the story of a journey , as Anderson describes it , through the earth's crust and into the mantle , requires a fundamental lack of modern scientific knowledge . So it follows that in a society that has commercial airlines , hybrid vehicles , portable video game devices that can search the internet at cruising altitude , cell phones that work anywhere on or in the planet , and modern computers , should also understand that a journey to the " center of the earth " is , as they say , an exercise in futility . Nonetheless , this could be a great way to spend some time with the kids this weekend and , although there is one emotional moment and one romantic moment in the movie and both fall completely flat , it's not the worst date movie I've ever seen . Even though Prof . Anderson and Sean encounter a creature late in the movie that betrays a stupendous lack of imagination on the part of the digital effects team , there are some clever and amusing scenes ( " We're STILL falling ! " ) but also plenty of cheeseball dialogue and half-assed performances ( Fraser's quivering lip is just too much . . . ) , but despite the roller coaster ride lifted right out of Indiana Jones and the bizarre idea of the magnetic rocks , the movie surpasses expectations . At least if you know what came before it . . .
" A man has to be a little nuts to be a good showman ? "	One of the few things that I really didn't like about the wax film that preceded this one , The Mystery of the House of Wax , was the way Ivan Igor's partner rushed to burn down the museum minutes after an art critic informed Igor that he was going to make his work famous and him a rich man , because he had just received this immense news and then his aggravated partner walked in seconds later and burned the place down for the insurance money . It was just so hard to accept that Igor's partner moved so fast that he was simply unable to utter a word about what new events had so recently transpired . In this film , Ivan Igor is played by Professor Henry Jarrod who is played by Vincent Price , and his partner is in full earshot when he hears the news that an art critic may want to buy into the project and free his own investment for whatever else he has in mind . Other events lead to him being unable to accept the offer , and the idea of cashing in on the insurance money remains on the table without the need for any fast talking or lack of an opportunity to get a word in edgewise about impending success in order for it to come about . Quite a nice little wrinkle that has been ironed out there , I should think . This does , however , render the overzealous investor into more of a villain than he was in the original film , especially when he carelessly tosses kerosene onto Jarrod as he is walking around dousing the sculptures to make them burn faster . It's possible that he is meant to have thought Jarrod was just another realistic statue , but he had to have known that he was still in there when he went around blowing out candles to cause a build-up of gas in the building . Evidently he didn't feel like sharing that insurance money !
" Let's rest our soles and exercise our eyes ! "	A Woman is one of the most sexually charged Chaplin films I've ever seen , and not only because Charlie spends a lot of it dressed as a woman . From the very opening of the film ( " Charlie Chaplin in A Woman " ) to the scene where he's having tea and bagels . He takes a long , phallic knife and skewers the bagels , allowing them to slide down the shaft onto their plates , and then he quips , " I do this trick in my bath - when I have one . " When you have one what , Charlie ? The rest of the film , however , is family friendly fun , even when Charlie is dressed as a woman . Most of the time he is playfully fending off the advances of a man who was furious with him minutes before , but now is completely fooled by the disguise . Charlie slaps and pushes and shoves him , knocking him over backwards and over furniture and whatnot , a lot of the typical slapstick that we have come to expect from Chaplin's short comedies of this era . This is not the only time Chaplin has dressed up as a woman in one of his short films , and once again he is surprisingly , almost disturbingly , convincing in the costume . A lot of the comedy of his silent slapstick comes from the effeminate nature of his mannerisms , and he puts those to good use here . The first half also takes place in a park and therefore resembles countless of his other short films that take place in a park , which used to be Chaplin's favorite place to go and set up the cameras and just let a little comedy happen , and it's clear that that was what was happening in this film . But the second half makes up for the unsurprising first half . Not a bad little film at all .
Fun for security guards and civilians alike !	Shortly into Paul Blart : Mall Cop , I was struck by a sudden realization that I wasn't sure if the movie was making fun of all security guards or just the ones that take their jobs too seriously . In pondering that question , I realized that the fun-poking that the movie does could wreak devastating havoc on the rent-a-cop industry in the United States . Can you imagine the terror if it suddenly became cool for security guards to slack off on the job ? I don't even want to think about it . The next thing I did was mourn the sad fate of the Segway , which was introduced to the public back in 2001 and was intended ( and many people believed it would ) to completely redefine the way we travel within cities and even design the cities themselves . It's easy to have believed that , too . Merely a year into the 21st century , the realization that flying cars remain distantly in the future ( or , more likely , forever limited to fiction ) paves the way for a strong belief that the futuristic vision of 21st century Americans that we have been waiting for might be something as simple as this curious little vehicle on which Americans of the future must soon be zooming around on . 8 years later , however , the Segway remains wildly over-priced and conspicuously absent from the general public . At most it's a curious oddity occasionally glimpsed in public , popping up more often as a sight gag in movies like Paul Blart or Ron Howard's brilliant televisions series " Arrested Development " than as an everyday means of transportation . And it's use on-screen is doing nothing to improve it's public image ! Paul Blart is a mall security guard who believes that his job is not only on par with a police officer , but even a member of the military . He zooms importantly around the mall on his Segway , calling codes and status updates into his shoulder radio even as his superiors sit in the main security office teasing him for being so serious . Paul is a lovable guy but the movie tries so hard to get us to laugh not only at his dead - serious attitude about his low-profile job but also at his weight and hypoglycemia issues that it becomes nearly impossible to accept his budding romance with a local hair-extensions salesgirl . Kevin James , of " King of Queens " fame , is a wonderful comedic actor who brings back fond memories of John Candy , but most of the movie hangs from him like a wet blanket . I do appreciate , however , that the movie attempts to get us to laugh without a single sex joke or body noise or any other such nonsense , and it's not overflowing with pointless profanity like so many other low-brow comedies these days . The action and romance are both thoroughly ridiculous , as are the bad guys who take over the mall ( with an intricate plot to steal , I kid you not , credit card numbers ) and then race around it on skateboards and BMX bikes , , but it's important to realize that the movie is a fun romp around a barricaded mall , sort of like what you would get if you combined Dawn of the Dead , Die Hard , and Home Alone , and removed any possibilities of zombies or bloodshed . Home Alone , for example , was gorier than this movie . And besides , it also features the funniest Indian accent since the 1986 classic Short Circuit . Peanut Blart and jelly !
M : I 2 definitely delivers as far as hard-core action , but some elements were excessive to the point of being cartoonish .	Ethan Hunt is back with another theoretically impossible mission . Tom Cruise once again delivered at least a satisfactory performance , along with all other actors involved , but John Woo's direction was a little bit excessive at some points . I fail to see what made it necessary for Hunt to be riding his motorcycle on the front wheel while firing at an oncoming car . Or how about that gun that was lying in the sand toward the end of the film ? Was that a little too unrealistic , or was it just me ? The story was good , the acting was convincing enough , and the action sequences were well put together , but they were just too much . One of the other things that really saved this film from action-packed obscurity was some very clever and well placed dialogue , particularly on the part of Ving Rhames , back once again as Luther Stickell ( " Ethan ! Nyah is in the building ! Do you copy ! " ) Despite M : I 2's shortcoming's , it will undoubtedly be very satisfying to the true action fan . It has explosions , gun fights , car chases , lethal viruses , Jackie Chan style fight scenes , and even a hint of a few WWF moves in those fights . Mission : Impossible 2 is a good action film . I was not tremendously impressed , but I also didn't feel like I had just wasted two hours . Go watch the movie , just don't expect it to be the phenomenal gift from the action movie gods that it was made out to be .
Not nearly as bad as you would think .	I worked in a video store a few years ago , and in 1998 and 1999 I was on this serious horror movie kick . I would rent them constantly and pretty much whenever a horror movie would go on sale at the store I would buy it . Parents was one of the more obscure horror movies that went on sale ( keep in mind that , in general , the reason they would go on sale would be because they hadn't been rented out in more than a year , so these were unpopular from the outset ) , and it fell into the unfortunate category of being one of the horror movies that I bought when I was in my horror movie kick and then didn't get to before it ended . Hence , I have owned it for almost four years and didn't watch it until yesterday . I would like to start off by commending the cover designer for making this one of the least appealing box covers that I have ever seen ( this may have been a significant factor in the reason that the movie didn't rent out for more than a year ) . But despite the startling cheesiness of the cover box , this is not an entirely incompetent horror film . I have a feeling that at least part of the movie's descent into obscurity may be a result of the fact that it is not at all original and , perhaps more importantly , Randy Quaid went on to a much bigger career in a completely different genre . Unfortunately , one of the movie's biggest strengths is the creepiness that it maintains throughout , which is sadly something that is almost plagiarized from The Shining . It's interesting to consider the similarities between this film and The Shining , and although the latter movie obviously owns the rights to the stolid man and wife with the single creepy son , Parents is far from a failure . I would go as far as to say that , even though the movie borrowed heavily from previous movies , it is able to stand on its own because of its strengths , so I would call the material it borrowed more of an homage than stealing or anything like that . The movie has a lot to say about suburban America in the 1950's , especially with the cute little tract housing and the white picket fence and the American Dream . Everyone wants a nice little house and a front yard and an obedient little kid who does good in school and a nice marriage , a good job , etc . What Parents does is to take that formula and show how much sick and twisted ( i . e . human ) stuff could be going on under the surface without anyone ever realizing it . Humans are animals , which is one of the primary things that 1950's suburban America wanted to hide . ( spoilers ) Where the movie crosses the line ( and thus turns into a horror film ) is when it presents a family that not only is a family of sinners , but cannibals . Bryan Madorsky delivers a startling performance as Michael , the son of Nick and Lily Lamele , a husband and wife with some questionable culinary interests , to say the least . Michael is a quiet and obviously disturbed boy ( for obvious reasons ) and the drama of the film really begins when he begins to question what exactly the ' leftovers ' were before they were leftovers . His parents give him this vague answer ( ' They were . soon to BE leftovers . ' ) , but we have all seen the cover box , so we already know the answer . Where the movie falters is when the creepiness fails to remain interesting on its own . The interactions that go on in the house are some of the creepiest scenes that I've seen in a movie since , well , since The Shining , but eventually the parents descend to typical horror movie villains ( especially the father ) , who ultimately kill each other in the climax , while the horrified ( or , rather , strangely UN-horrified ) son looks on . Despite the weak ending , however , the movie manages to avoid being more of the cheesy crap that you see in the more obscure areas of the horror sections ( and by the way , being an unrecognizable film in the horror or science fiction section at the video store is like being in video limbo - NO one watches these movies ) . I put the movie in to kill some time between class and work and was surprised at how interesting it is . At the very least , if you're going to write this movie off as being just some cheap horror movie , here's something good that it did - I've always been curious about what human meat would taste like . Now I don't think I ever want to know .
At the beginning William H . Macy says that there's nowhere that you can't be reached anymore . Obviously he's never tried making a cell-phone call from my apartment .	Larry Cohen tells an interesting story at the beginning of this documentary about conversations that he had with Alfred Hitchcock about the screenplay for Phone Booth , which gives you an idea of how long he's been kicking that idea around . Also , the theme of extraordinary things happening in ordinary places probably explains why Hitchcock found it interesting . Unlike one of the other documentaries that accompanies Cellular , " Celling Out , " this one is actually about the making of the movie and is pretty impressive . There are interviews with all of the major cast members and plenty of good footage from the set , which I also found particularly interesting because I have been to so many of the locations on which the movie was filmed . It's interesting to watch a movie being made and to know exactly where they are and what that environment is like . At one point in the documentary someone claims that Chris Evans , who plays Ryan , is the next Tom Cruise . He turns in an impressive performance , but I wouldn't go THAT far . Just as I would disagree , despite the fact that director David Ellis says " dude " a lot , that he is " the " dude . David Ellis is NOT the Dude . Jeff Bridges is the Dude . Other than that , this gives a pretty good look at the making of the movie , especially a lot of the stunt scenes and car chases , for which they utilized some pretty impressive film-making techniques . Worth watching .
Okay , but how does this all work ?	I just caught an episode about Brad , the crack cocaine addict who turned to a drug addicted life on the streets after his bicycle racing career went to shambles as fast as it started . I have to say that the story about his biking career was more heart-breaking than his drug addiction . Here's this young guy who is winning bike races left and right and is invited to train with an Olympic training team for two weeks , and immediately upon arriving he insults Lance Armstrong , one of the greatest athletes who ever lived , and is generally callous and unfriendly to everyone in general . Understandably , he is soon asked to leave . Most of the show is about his struggle with addiction and how he got his life back , but what I wanted to know was what was wrong with him in the first place to make his act like such an ass ? At any rate , I was confused about how the show was put together , since it shows Brad at the height of his addiction . We see footage of him pan-handling and sleeping in gutters and ditches and even smoking crack cocaine . I didn't even know that was legal to show , but why would a camera crew just follow him around and film that ? Do they do that in hopes that this guy will turn his life around and give them some material for a good TV episode ? At any rate , it is an enlightening show , because it shows the effects of various addictions and the total control that they can take over people's lives . Sometimes it's hard to watch because you really see how badly the families and friends suffer in the face of the addict's indifference , although I have to admit that at the end it all seems a little too clean-cut . There are times during the episodes when terrible things happen and everything seems lost , but still , and maybe I should warn about spoilers here , everything has a little too much of a happily-ever-after feel at the end , and I have a feeling that that is a very uncommon occurrence in real life . But still , it's a show about people trying to help other people , and you can never complain too much about something like that ?
It wasn't THAT bad ?	I've read some seriously negative reviews of The Art of War . There are IMDb users out there who hated this movie to no end , which leads me to wonder why I rented it in the first place , having read many of these reviews already , and why it was seen as so much worse than anything Wesley Snipes has done up to this point . Snipes has made some good movies , and some bad ones , just like almost every actor out there ( although there are certainly some that only make good ones and some that only make bad ones , but Snipes seems to have about an equal amount of each , maybe leaning slightly in favor of the bad ) , and I don't really think The Art of War is any different . It's a typical action film in which he plays virtually the exact same character that he played in Rising Sun , except here he's been framed as an assassin and , as is always the case with movies in which the good guy has been framed for some crime , he has to set out to prove his innocence with no help from the police and without knowing who he can trust . ( spoilers ) Michael Biehn stars as Robert Bly , Neil Shaw's ( Snipes ) ill-fated partner . Biehn has been largely missing in action ( pun intended ) for several years , his only notable appearances since the spectacular Terminator ( and since being deleted from Terminator 2 ) being an excellent role in The Rock and his thoroughly enjoyable performances in movies like The Abyss , Aliens , and Navy SEALS . Given this iconology , it's strange to consider the role that he was given in The Art of War . Naturally , actors are given roles that go against their iconography all the time ( a recent example would be Tom Hanks in The Road to Perdition ) , but there is generally a reason for that or at least something about that actor's personality or charisma that fits with the role that they are given . In The Art of War , there is little reason to have Biehn play the role that he plays other than to cover up the plot twist near the end of the film . That's just weak writing . Like I said above , I enjoyed The Art of War more than many other reviewers seemed to . The introduction of the conflict is particularly impressive . The chase through the building early in the film is not only exciting , but thoroughly convincing so that you really don't guess what's really happening . Regardless of how the mystery is created ( whether or not it be because of the strange role given to Michael Biehn ) , consider how well the frame was set up . Shaw is running through this building chasing the bad guy , he hears his partner shot twice on the radio , so just as he bursts into the street which is crowded with police , his adrenaline is pumping and his face is contorted with the grief of knowing that his partner has just been killed . It's easy to understand that the police could have mistaken his expression for grief at having been caught trying to escape the scene of the crime that they think he has just committed . I might like to take this opportunity to point out that while I certainly found The Art of War to be at least a mildly entertaining action film , I did not find it to be any more than that . It is most certainly a vehicle for some good Wesley Snipes action , but is there really anything wrong with that ? I personally enjoy watching Steven Seagal movies and Van Damme movies , just because they're entertaining and , quite often , more amusing than anything else . Given that , I would not be being fair if I condemned The Art of War for not having much intellectual content to speak of . I am normally not one to forgive stupidity in the movies , but the thing that allows me to forgive the cheesy action in The Art of War ( as an example of how seriously the movie takes itself , consider the extensive kung-fu fighting scene that takes place during the New Year celebration early in the film , to the grand enjoyment of everyone in attendance , who are all lucky enough to see it close up on the big screen ) is that it doesn't pretend to be anything else . Unlike a Bruckheimer film , it does not throw in all of the necessary ingredients to attract every kind of audience that can be attracted to an audience , which is an unfortunately prevalent tactic that results in a lot of movies that could have been great but instead come out as muddy messes . The Art of War is a straight up action film , and whether you loved it or hated it or anything in between , you have to respect it for allowing itself to be seen as such in a society that more and more seems to condemn purity in the movies .
Little Girl Julia .	Flightplan is a taut psychological thriller that very nearly earns its description as Hitchcockian , there are plenty of similarities and even specific shots that are very Hitchcockian ( the shot of the crows flying away at the beginning of the film , for example ) , but there are times when the movie almost falls apart in the third act . Thrillers have a tendency to fall on their faces as soon as it's revealed what's actually going on , but this movie at least has real reasons for things like why Kyle Pratt ( Jodie Foster ) just happens to be an airline engineer and knows her way around the plane when her daughter turns up missing , it was explained how things were pulled off by those responsible , etc , and not even in the Scooby-Doo ending kind of way . But when you find out what's happening , it almost turns into your standard , run of the mill kidnapping thriller , and even the ones that take place on airplanes have been overdone already . In the movie's defense , however , it is brilliantly cast . Jodie Foster established herself as a parent not to be messed with in Little Man Tate in 1991 and then reiterated in spectacular fashion in Panic Room a decade or so later . Even more importantly , there are also plenty of suspects to keep you guessing ? Sean Bean , no stranger to bad guy roles , Peter Sarsgaard , for the same reason , the terrorists ( whose suspicions were thankfully toned down from earlier versions of the script , but who still exchange mysterious glances with other Arabs when they are first approached ) , any members of the crew , etc . Where the movie really fails is in deliberately leading the audience in one direction simply to hide what's coming . The two guys looking into Julia's room at the beginning of the film ( and Kyle's realization later that the strange Arab guy on the plane was one of them and that's why she though she recognized him ) . More importantly , the movie fails logistically . On paper I'm sure the idea of this kind of story worked really well , but you have to consider the person that would plan out a scheme this meticulously that could hinge on something like the need to get a woman and her daughter onto a plane with more than 400 other passengers , and have not a single person notice her enough to be able to say later that she boarded with a little girl and not alone . Also , they may have been able to avoid deploying the entire Newfoundland police force and military had they checked the surveillance tapes at the airport to see whether or not Kyle actually had a little girl with her when she got on the plane . So while close scrutiny of the story reveals enough plot holes to drive a whole fleet of two - story , E-474's through , it is still a taut thriller that is wildly entertaining for the first half and still remains satisfactory after the mystery element is bluntly removed . Jodie Foster delivers a powerful performance , almost too powerful for the rest of the movie to handle , and six-year - old Marlene Lawston is stunningly convincing as her daughter . Her traumatized performance in the first part of the film is just astonishing . All of that being said , I suppose I look back with some degree of disappointment in the movie because it had so many simple but glaring flaws and plot holes , but while I was watching it I think I went through about five or six pounds of popcorn and I loved it . As for thrillers these days , there are definitely better ones than this , but there are far more worse ones than better .
A surprisingly good drama about the hardships of professional ballet dancing , but unfortunately brought down a bit by a routine romance between the main characters .	Center Stage is a very well thought out film that follows a group of dancers through their trials in a prestigious dancing academy . The acting and directing are both very good , but the film as a whole suffers from the un-creative insertion of a done-to-death love story . The exact same love triangle seen in Center Stage can be seen in countless other films of all kinds , and this is an unfortunate problem with this film , which is otherwise extremely good . Sure , there are plenty of dancing movies out there , but there really aren't that many that deal specifically with ballet . The way that the story is partially acted out while the characters are doing impressive dance scenes is excellent , but a bit of cheesy acting late in the film as well as a disappointingly predictable ending take a lot away from it . Despite its problems , however , Center Stage is a very enjoyable and watch-able film . Not the best , but definitely quality entertainment .
A successful attempt at creating a love-struck dramatic thriller , but Dragonfly goes a little too far with the supernatural element at some points .	Dragonfly is the story of Joe Darrow ( Kevin Costner ) who suddenly loses his wife , and his reaction is to work even harder at the hospital , ' to prevent anyone else from joining her . ' While working virtually nonstop at the hospital , strange things begin to happen with some of the kids who have near death experiences , particularly the ones who were previously looked after by Emily ( Susanna Thompson ) , Joe's wife . This is where the first of the supernatural clichés comes in , as we see a kid flat-lining who is declared dead , only to jerk his head up and look straight at Joe with bulging eyes for a split second , and then drop his head back to the pillow . Nice little spooky moment , but we've seen it about a thousand times before . This kid and another kid begin to tell Joe about their encounters with Emily in their near death experiences , leading him to believe that she is stuck in limbo and desperately trying to reach him . ( spoilers ) There are plenty of cheesy moments in the movie , but as a whole it is an interesting and entertaining supernatural love story . The ending is a complete cop-out , despite being mildly satisfying . It's just too much that his wife survived the crash , made it to the village downriver , and won the hearts of the tribe there ( the one that ' hates outsiders ' ) to the point where they delivered her baby and kept her in a hut ( after Emily's death ) like it was delivered straight from the gods . Kept it there , that is , until Joe arrived to pick her up . I will admit that I loved seeing Joe united with his daughter , but there comes a point when things are happening in the movie just a little too conveniently . For the sake of brevity , I won't go into all such instances , but as another example , let's not overlook the fact that Joe's foot was so jammed on that bus that he drowned , and then when he was pulled from the bus it drifted right out like it had never been stuck at all . I have already complained about the supernatural element of the movie , but not because I don't think that it was creative or that I don't think it was a good addition to the story . On the contrary , thinking back on it after the movie was over , I thought that the supernatural element was one of the most interesting parts of the movie , although I stand by my opinion that it just became goofy at some points . I loved the whole mystery surrounding the crucifixes made out of jell-o , especially when they kept turning up in increasingly strange places and in strange ways , I liked the way that dragonflies kept turning up in unusual places , and I especially liked the scene where the paper-weight finds its way out of the box and back onto the counter , and all of Joe's clothes find their way out of his suitcase and right back into the closet . On the one hand , things like this indicate a more cheesy supernatural thriller ( a lot of this is stuff that you would expect to see in bad horror movies ) . For example , when Joe is selling his house , why does he feel the need to do all of his packing in the middle of the night and in total darkness except for one small bedside lamp ? But on the other hand , there are usually some counterarguments against things like this . Maybe he left all the lights off ( especially after he had run out of the house , at which point everyone in the audience is probably wishing that he would just go inside and turn on the lights ? at least ONE light ) because he was just as desperate to hear from Emily as she supposedly was to contact him . The whole idea of having these kids draw these wiggly crucifixes is one of the main things that keeps your attention captivated throughout the film , and I liked that it turned out to be a way for Emily to tell Joe where she lived the last days of her life , as well as where their daughter was . I was also glad that the movie didn't go the way of Joe making the attempt to have a near-death experience himself so he could see Emily in an experience of his own . I was starting to get afraid that I was about to see a sequel to Flatliners . There were some genuinely scary moments in Dragonfly , such as the scene when Joe hears Big Bird , the talking parrot that never talks to him , calling out ' Honey , I'm home , ' in the middle of the night . This scene involves Joe walking down a long , dark hallway toward a lightly swaying door with a bright light behind it ( probably one of the most tired clichés in the genre ) , but hearing the bird saying that was just like Emily was speaking through it . I was impressed . The light behind the door is followed by the standard scare of an animal shrieking and suddenly interrupting the stone silence ( this is usually done with a cat , so at least they changed SOMEthing ) , but there were definitely some good scares in this scene . I've heard some complaints about the casting in this film , but I can't say that I understand why someone would complain . Kevin Costner , in particular , is a veteran of this exact type of role , and I admit that I have an almost immutable liking for him even if he's in a bad film . Susanna Thompson portrays Emily wonderfully , for the little amount of time that she's in the film , and the rest of the cast adds very nicely to the film , creating a realistic atmosphere , particularly in the hospital setting . Dragonfly has the unfortunate quality of being a film that delivers several new ideas and situations , but these are grouped along with a line of clichés and routine situations . This is not the most memorable film , but it definitely has its shining moments .
Jumanji 2000 ?	The similarities between Zathura and its 1995 counterpart , Jumanji , are so extensive that you will probably end up having exactly the same opinion of the new one as you did of the original . But Zathura is not really a sequel to Jumanji , it's more of a remake . Strange that a remake would come along so soon after the first movie , but there area some definite leaps forward in terms of special effects , although not in terms of the plot , which is pretty much identical to Jumanji . An important difference is that the characters in Zathura are three-dimensional and realistic . The performances of the two boys in the movie , as well as the dialogue written for them , approach a level of flawlessness that I would never have expected to see from such young actors . Clearly , it's not exactly much of a stretch for them to get in character , since they are essentially playing themselves , but these are a couple of the best young performances I've ever seen in a movie . Kristen Stewart , who has appeared more more than 20 movies in her less than 20 years , also nails her lines as their disgusted older sister Lisa . There is a scene mid-way through the movie where , for reasons that should give you an idea of what kind of adventure this is , the family sofa slowly rolls end over end and on fire into the depths of outer space . My immediate reaction was to think ' Hey , fire doesn't burn in space ? ' and then I remembered that the burning sofa was emerging from a charming two - story home which was orbiting Saturn with two young boys standing on the porch . The application of logic will do nothing but aggravate you and totally ruin the experience . Tim Robbins has a limited role of a divorced father of two young boys , Walter and Danny , who are just at that age where they fight over everything imaginable . Frustrations are growing as dad needs time to himself for work , Danny wants to play with his older brother , and Walter wants nothing to do with him . Dad has to leave them alone for a while to go to the office , and Danny finds a game buried in the basement called Zathura . He tries to get Walter to play , but Walter wants to watch ESPN . As is the case in the first movie , the game is started accidentally and then All Hell Breaks Loose . What begins with a harmless indoor meteor shower that completely destroys nothing but the living room soon evolves to the point where the house has been uprooted and put into orbit around Saturn and an armada of space ships piloted by vicious Zorgons are attacking with all manner of alien firepower . Similarities to the first movie get a little too close for comfort when it's revealed that the boys have to finish the game successfully in order to get back to the real world , but it doesn't stop the movie from being a lot of fun . My only real gripe with the movie is that I think they overshot a little bit with the message about the importance of siblings . It's clear that the movie is aimed for a bit of a younger audience due to the heavy reliance on action and special effects and the thinness of the plot , but when the truth is revealed about the astronaut that fulfills the role of Robin Williams ' character in Jumanji it's pretty hard not to roll the eyes at least a little bit . It is , however , an important message , although a little less ham-handedness in the delivery wouldn't have hurt . As a science fiction film the movie works great , especially as a more family-oriented story . The special effects are impressive ( particularly the killer robot , which is probably the most consistently outstanding effect in the entire movie ) and the dangers of space travel and alien encounters are mixed brilliantly with the storybook adventure of two young boys trapped in a dangerous situation and simply trying to , ah , get home . If nothing else , Zathura must surely be the biggest adventure that two young boys have ever had in trying to get home without ever leaving their house . Director Jon Favreau first came to my attention in Swingers in 1996 but has lately been making big waves in the directing department . His previous directing features had been Elf and the hilarious 2001 crime comedy Made , and lately he's been keeping himself busy with the first two Iron Man movies . Zathura seems like a perfect midway point between the amusing comedies of his early directing career and the big-time science fiction that he's working on now . Zathura is not his best work , but it's definitely some of the better family - oriented science fiction to come along recently .
A puzzling addition to the Sergeant York DVD . . .	I'm completely at a loss to explain why this short video is included as an extra feature on the Sergeant York DVD , but it is at least an interesting look at some of the techniques used in training lions . I imagine maybe it has something to do with the training of soldiers , although the two types of training don't have much in common beyond the fact that they are each some sort of training . The lion cubs are impossibly cute , and obviously this is about as diluted a look at animal training as you can imagine , but it's entertaining enough for it's diminutive ten minute running time . Definitely worth checking out if you're into animal training or just watching cute lion kittens pawing desperately for a bottle of milk . . .
What a title !	When I started watching Let's Scare Jessica to Death , with a title like that , I was expecting it to be one of those old , gritty horror movies from the 70s that looks like it was made on a nearly non-existent budget but still has plenty of genuinely disturbing moments . There's one that I can't remember the name of that concerns a family where all the children are sort of trapped in the house , and they are all elderly people that dress and act like children . It costs no money to shoot something like that but there is a definite element of the bizarre that makes it memorable . Either that or one of those cheesy old horror movies with a lot of teenagers getting killed off one by one . Lord knows I've seen plenty of those , and the title of this movie sounds like something a bunch of teenagers would cook up to do to their friend , only to have their plan work out a little too well . About midway through the movie , however , I came to the startling realization that the title has absolutely nothing to do with the story . In fact , the title suggests a completely different story than the one we get , in which Jessica struggles with her own mental instability . If anyone is trying to scare her to death , it's her own mind . Jessica is released from a mental institution early in the film , and almost immediately begins having visual hallucinations , but vows to keep it a secret from he friends , who are all glad to see her on the outside again ( " Don't tell them , act normal ? " ) . Right away the movie comes off like it's going to be another murder-in-the-woods film like the Friday the 13th movies and the endless sequels and imitations . When the group of friends are on a drive up to the mountains , they tell a local where they're going and get a chilly , even suspicious look . For the first 30 minutes or so I was completely engaged . The film hasn't dated very well , but these 70s horror movies are great for a fun Friday night with your friends . They don't make movies like this anymore , and it's a shame . After a while though , the pace gets to be a little too slow , but that at least allows for a unique character development , something uncommon in films like this . The story concerns Jessica's struggle to overcome her mental illness , which is putting a strain on her marriage . Her husband is growing tired or her lapses and begins yearning for a more normal life , and one day he finally cheats on her with a redhead with stunningly beautiful eyes , but who bears a creepy resemblance to one of the Bishop girls , the family that resided in the house where they're staying . Jessica is convinced it's the same girl , but she is in no position to try to convince anyone that the dead girl from the picture is now sleeping with her husband . It's hard to classify Let's Scare Jessica to Death , because it defies so many routine 70s horror clichés and becomes unpredictable just when you think you know exactly what's happening , but it does get a little too campy for its own good by the end of the movie . The music is truly , fittingly bizarre throughout , although the whispering voices in Jessica's head are massively over-used and even become boring by the end , and any disconnected realism that they might have had fades away , leaving me picturing someone whispering the words into a microphone rather than Jessica hearing voices in her head . There was also a brief lesbian moment that came out of nowhere and went nowhere . The end of the movie has a strange but effective scene where everyone has some kind of scar on their body , although I must have missed what the meaning of the scars is supposed to be . They may , however , only be in her mind , but the movie does effectively give a suggestion as to what it might like to be mentally unstable , and I always enjoy movies that do that ( remember In Dreams ? ) . All in all , the movie is nothing like what you might imagine from hearing the title , but still better than the average 70s horror fare ?
One of the earlier , but definitely not one of the best , Pixar animation shorts .	It's wonderful to watch a short animated film like Tin Toy and then watch one like Geri's Game or For The Birds , because you can really see how far Pixar has come over the years . In Toy Story , one of the things that they never got quite right was the look of human faces , but it is clear after watching Tin Toy that they have really improved in that area as well . What you have in Tin Toy is an extremely simple story of a new toy that is at first fascinated but soon understandably horrified by the hideously misshapen baby that he sees terrorizing toys all around him . Besides foreshadowing a huge amount of the plot of the later Toy Story , this short film also contains a lot of symbolism and adheres to a story structure that dates back to medieval literature . This baby is the representation of the horrible monster that can be found in stories around the world , holding people in horrible fear under its control , waiting for some hero to come along and rescue them . The heroic tin toy spends a few minutes fleeing from the horrifying baby ( whose approach is far more fearful than ANY Tyranosaurus Rex ) , but then when the massive baby falls and begins to cry , the toy realizes his purpose and goes out to amuse the baby ( " You're a cool toy ! " ) . Okay , this part never really happened in any of the classic romances where people are held captive by a huge monster , but this is where the film turns from the classic story structure and begins to concentrate on the reality of modern children . One of the more appealing things about this short film is the closeness with which it portrays real children ( although they were horribly far off on the physical appearance ) . Even the child's momentary pause before sneezing is surprisingly realistic , but there are also behavioral things that are captured here , such as the notorious habit of children becoming more interested in the box that their toy came in than they are in the toy itself . Pixar clearly started off early depicting the interests and behaviors of children on screen , and their films have progressed enormously from short films like this one . Tin Toy is not terribly remarkable compared to the later films from Pixar , but from shorts like Tin Toy it can be seen that they have always worked very closely within this particular genre , which is likely a good reason why they are now making children's films that easily rival even the classic Disney masterpieces .
Mr . Bean has a very distinctive and narrow brand of slapstick comedy so his target audience is not that huge , but people who are into his humor should LOVE this movie .	I had never seen any of Rowan Atkinson's performances as Mr . Bean when this movie came out in 1997 , so I knew nothing about it when I went to see it other than that it was about the zany adventures of this strange looking man on the movie poster . He strikes me as one of those comedians that you either completely love or completely hate , because his comedy is so extreme . It's not the kind of thing that you can watch and just sort of like or not really care for . It's one of those movies where it's not surprising to see people walk out in the middle while other people are just about falling out of their chairs laughing so hard . Personally , I was one of the latter . I admit that Bean certainly deals in a very childish sort of humor . This is , by definition , slapstick comedy , and it is certainly not for all tastes . But from the movie's opening scene , which shows Bean gleefully shaving his entire face with an electric razor ( including his forehead and even his tongue ) , you know that this is what the movie is like , so you can't really hold that against it . The story in the film is clearly one of those that is invented for the movie and then manipulated to fit the screenplay and to work nicely into the movie . It's not that hard to realize that such a huge art gallery could be fooled for so long by someone like Mr . Bean , thinking that he's a genius , and certainly no way that he would be left alone with a $50 million painting long enough to remove it from the vault and rub paint thinner into it , but on the other hand , the rest of the comedy fits so nicely into this plot . At the very least , there are relatively realistic situations thrown into an unrealistic plot , which makes the movie enjoyable even though you don't really take it seriously . There is a wonderful scene , for example , where Bean sneezes on the painting of Whistler's Mother , and then he tries to wipe off the spray with his handkerchief , which has been smeared with a leaky pen . So the painting gets smeared with ink , and he grabs the first can he sees off a nearby shelf , which happens to be paint thinner . It cleans the ink off nicely but then causes the paint to boil off , and then Bean frantically tries to save it by wiping it even harder , rubbing the paint off right down to the canvas . Sure , this is not the mark of an intelligent mind , but that's the point of the whole movie . Bean is a film that relies on the fact that humans are so amused by the misfortunes of others . There's something funny about seeing someone else get into a sticky situation , and in movies like this , they do just that and things only get worse and worse . Granted , there are a million ways out of every situation that Bean gets into that would be less painful than the routes that he chooses , but if he took them there would be no movie . Consider , for example , the bathroom scene where a man walks in on Bean as he appears to be getting a little too friendly with a hot air dryer . He quickly grabs a light bulb pretending that he had been examining it , and then the man leaves and Bean drops the hot bulb to break on the ground and when he goes to run cold water over his burnt fingers the water sprays his crotch again . Total slapstick , but that's funny ! Like I said , Bean is not a movie for all tastes . But there is a place for childish humor in movies , and that place is in movies like this . It certainly can be taken too far or simply done wrong , as in the case of movies like the American Pies or the Scary Movies , etc . , but Bean is a movie that knows what kind of comedy it delivers , and it knows how far to go before things just descend into vulgarity and bad taste . It's a comedy that does not pretend to be anything that it's not , and for that it should be respected . It is also , by the way , the kind of a comedy that allows for an almost innumerable amount of sequels . While I can certainly see it being vastly overdone , I would just like to say that if a couple more Bean movies were to be made , I would be among the last to complain !
What is insanity truly like ? Watch In Dreams and you'll find out .	The color red is very significant in In Dreams , in everything from the apples that seem to represent Claire's ( Annette Bening ) fears to the red dress that she is dressed in the numerous times that she ' dies ' to the weird red color of Vivian's ( Robert Downey Jr . ) hair towards the end of the film . The color red is used to constantly remind the audience of the tenseness and fear in the film . Ironically enough , the first thing that went through my mind when I saw Robert Downey Jr . as the psychopath as he approached Claire toward the end of the film was that he was horribly miscast in this film , and that his presence would inevitably lead to the ultimate disappointment that I expected to feel after the movie ended . However , aside from the goofy contact lenses that he wore and the obviously dyed hair , I was surprisingly impressed with his contribution to the film . In the film's closing scene , in particular , he was able to deliver one final performance that left jaws dropped as the credits began . In Dreams is definitely not for everyone . I think that for this particular film , there will be people who loved it , people who hated it , and people who just didn't understand it , with probably not much in between . Unfortunately , it was much more effective on the big screen than on video , but with a healthy twist of the volume knob , it can be made to have virtually the same effect . Just don't watch it alone if you live out in the woods !
A quality re-make , but still not nearly as good as Thunderball .	I'm sick and tired of people complaining that Never Say Never Again is just a weak remake of Thunderball . Yes , that movie's influence is unmistakable , but the tremendous and almost universal inferiority of re-made films is reserved for such thoughtless and unintelligent films like the 1998 re-make of Psycho . While it's true that the opening theme of the twelfth ( and Connery's last ) Bond film is one of the worst of the entire series , the film itself still manages to stand on its own , despite many other weaknesses . Besides that , even the weak title song is made to blend pretty nicely with the closing dialogue in the film . Sure , Sean Connery was getting a little on in age when this movie was filmed ( at least by James Bond standards ) , but there is plenty of evidence in the narrative that makes it clear that this was not exactly unknown to the filmmakers . James Bond is near retirement before he is handed his assignment , having spent most of recent time teaching , not doing , and there is even the tongue in cheek insistence from M that he pay more attention to his health , dieting and training and getting more exercise and whatnot . Besides , this is James Bond , remember ? This guy is supposed to be some kind of super human , and all of his fans are getting all upset because he's got some gray hairs . When this guy retires at the end of the film , M sends poor ' Small-Fawcett ' ( in a hilarious cameo from Rowan Atkinson ) to tell Bond that without him , he worries about the safety of the free world , and all of you people can't get over the fact that he's not a sprightly young man anymore . Come on , Sean Connery could STILL play James Bond just as good as he ever could , or at least better than anyone else ever has been able to . The majority of the film deals with the elaborate plan to steal nuclear missiles and hold the world hostage ( as Dr . Evil would say , ' Oh hell , let's just do what we always do ? ' ) , so there's clearly not much new there , but this is one of the Bond films that had the better one liners . There's the amusing scene where Bond is asked for a urine sample ? ' If you could just fill this beaker for me ? ' ' From here ? ' There are a lot of good one-liners , but the sexual innuendos aimed at Mr . Bond are especially prevalent in this installment . But then later he happens to throw that very urine sample into a villain's face , making him scream as if his face were burning off . Not a very good attempt at comic relief , especially since this guy had been kicking Bond's ass with some sort of super-spring device that could cut through pretty much anything . And of course , Kim Basinger stars in this film as one of the best Bond girls of the entire series . It's no secret that Never Say Never Again has dated badly , and one of the things that has dated the worst is the special effects ? with the one exception of the flying missiles , which were obviously fake but still impressive for 1982 . The colored contact lens at the beginning of the film was totally without effect , and the laser watch was one of the worst things in the entire movie , second only to those damn sharks . Evidently , Fatima Blush put some sort of device on his scuba tank that attracted sharks ( granted , they did have weird guiding mechanisms of their own ) , in a scene that more than likely inspired the classic line , ' I have one simple request . And that is to have sharks with FRICKIN ' laser beams attached to their heads ! ' And then , of course , there is the exploding hotel room scene which was redone in an episode of The Simpsons , and which was obviously followed by another obligatory and overly casual one-liner from James . The domination video game created by Largo , the film's villain , is an especially memorable scene , and the film also boasts what is probably the best motorcycle chase in the entire series ( far to superior to the laughable one in Tomorrow Never Dies ) . But despite many strengths , the film's weaknesses are left clearer in the audience's mind at the end of the film due in large part to the anticlimactic underwater conclusion ( one of the more obvious parts borrowed from Thunderball , and inferiorly recreated ) . Never mind the fact that Largo revealed some crucial information to Bond as he left him in the tower alive ( Dr . Evil's brilliance , once again , ' I'll just leave him there without actually witnessing his death and just assume everything went to plan . What ? ' ) , the climax of what is expected to be a fast-paced action film should never take place in a muted underwater atmosphere . All in all , Never Say Never Again ranks very highly on the James Bond scale , and Connery's wink at the end of the film ( as well as the two closing lines ) suggested at the time that he may still return for another turn as Bond . Clearly , this is no longer very likely , so we can only hope .
Genuinely heartwarming but truly unrealistic . . .	The overarching tendency that I noticed in I Am Sam is that it is so good at making the audience root for Sam and his daughter Lucy to be able to stay together , but the better it is at that , the further it gets from reality . Very little is revealed about Lucy's conception beyond the fact that she was born from a homeless woman who " only wanted a place to sleep . " Granted , we don't need graphic details , but it's pretty hard to imagine Sam being involved in sexual or even romantic situation , much less being in a position to offer someone a place to sleep . The guy literally can't make a cup of coffee . Nevertheless , Lucy comes into the world and , despite having the " mental capacity of a 7 - year-old , " his love for Lucy is real and he desperately doesn't want to lose her . Where the movie really gains sympathy and is heartwarming is in Sam's struggle to understand why she's being taken away . He just wants to spend time with her and play with her and read to her and simply can't grasp what's so bad about that . I Am Sam is an actor's film . It's all about Dakota Fanning's performance as Lucy and Sean Penn's performance as Sam , both of which are astonishing . What is the deal with Dakota Fanning , by the way ? I can't understand that girl at all . She is one of the only actors I've ever seen who so consistently turns in nearly flawless performances , even in the otherwise disappointing Man On Fire , in which the managed to steal the show even from the great Denzel Washington . The girl was born in the mid-90s , for crying out loud ! The main problem with the film is that , while it's tremendously effective as a heartwarming tear-jerker , the bad guys are right . The lawyers fighting to have Lucy taken away and put into a foster home are portrayed almost as movie-villains , when in fact what they are fighting for is , in fact , in Lucy's best interest . It's not a genuine flaw , as I'll explain later , but I can understand the criticisms . It's not the best thing in the eyes of an 8-year-old girl or in the eyes of a movie audience , but in the real world , it's true that a man who struggle to read anything more complex than Dr . Seuss will have significant difficulties raising a daughter more than literally a matter of months after the age we see her in the movie . When Lucy wants to learn to drive or has boyfriend trouble , she will likely be much less interested in , as Ebert pointed out , helping her father with her own homework . But what the movie definitely does right is that , even though it's based on a massive fallacious myth ( " Love is all you need " is not at all true in any kind of relationship , parental , romantic , or otherwise ) , it does show the importance of people coming together to help each other . It's a thin line , but the movie is not about love , it's about caring . It's about everyone doing what is best for everyone else , not everyone doing what is best for Lucy , because that can be the worst thing for other people and , in turn , a terrible thing for Lucy . Laura Dern's character , Randy Carpenter , is introduced as a foster mother for which Lucy has not the slightest hint of affection ( " My dad's coming . Why don't you just go do something . . . " ) , and presents a stern front when Sam arrives . She sees him as a bit of a threat to her , in that he doesn't understand her emotions and needs , but as she begins to understand the relationship between Lucy and her father her tone changes by the end . Sam can't raise Lucy alone , and many people have criticized the movie for this , but it should be noted that the movie also understands this . It ends in the only way that it should ( and the only way that it could , as it were ) , and even though , like As Good As It Gets , it ends with the feeling that more difficulties are just around the corner , we get what we want . It's flawed but it's a huge achievement as well . And it's a great date movie !
Objection ! ! Leading !	I almost didn't watch Murder By Numbers , for two reasons . First , I'm not the biggest Sandra Bullock fan , but second and more importantly , the trailer does not do the movie justice at all . In fact , I would advise against watching the trailer , because it will almost destroy all interest in watching the movie , like it did to me . The problem is that the trailer gives the impression that Murder By Numbers is a murder mystery with no mystery , because it is obvious from the start that there is no question as to who the murderers are . It leaves you with the feeling that if you watch the preview , you've seen the movie . Kind of like what happened with Pleasantville . It is not long before it becomes clear that this is not a murder mystery , it's a murder thriller . True , there is never any question about who the killers are , but the point of the movie is the chess game that they play with the investigators on their trail . It is difficult to accept Sandra Bullock as a CSI , but at least in the second half of the film she pulls it off . In the first half she was going through the motions , for some reason not really seeming to believe what she was saying , or who she was supposed to be in the film . Of course , this is all just my reaction , I could be completely wrong . On the negative side , the movie comes dangerously close to glorifying the Columbine shootings , although it features one rich popular kid and one recluse as the killers , while Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold were both outcasts lashing out against the popular crowd . Richard , the popular kid , displays some odd behavior in his friendship with Justin , the recluse . He seems to think that they're dating and acts like an over-protective , jealous boyfriend , generating much of his rage from times when Justin doesn't pay enough attention to him or , even worse , kisses a girl . Justin is the brains behind the operation , having studied in great detail the investigative practices that would follow their master plan , Richard is the motivation . He really wants to do this , and the only reason that he ever gives in the movie is that he was bored . A true sociopath . On the other hand , maybe it was Richard who felt like the outcast , given his lack of success with the girls . Granted , he didn't seem to have any trouble getting in bed with the girl Justin was interested in in order to turn him against her , but consider the reaction that he always seemed to get from Lisa , which was limited to obscene hand gestures . He was , of course , of the variety of high school kids who thought that the good way to get a girl's attention was to drive up next to her blasting Iron Maiden at full volume and flashing the devil's horns . Charming . Maybe if he had tried some more romantic Iron Maiden than The Number of the Beast , like Seventh Son of a Seventh Son , or Infinite Dreams . Chicks love Infinite Dreams . The movie has a lot to say about the bureaucracy of criminal investigations , as Cassie Mayweather ( Bullock ) struggles to follow the strong leads that she has come across , while her boss attempts to force her to stop investigating the crime , already intent on closing the case with the tentative conclusion already reached . I'm not sure if this is meant to portray him as simply wanting the case over and done with or to show that he really doesn't care whether the real killer ( s ) is / are ever caught , as long as someone goes down for the crime . Either way it's not a very glowing portrayal of authority figures . Then again , Cassie , being the only flaw in their plan , is meant to come across as this sort of reckless independent investigator , in one of the very few weak things about this movie . That's what every movie like this does . There is always someone who is forced to give up on a case because they're too close to it ( the victim was a relative , lover , etc . ) , because they are a liability ( they know the killer , the killer knows them , etc . ) , or because they are too dangerous ( they destroyed half a city block and lost a lot of evidence ) . In this case , Cassie's forced to leave the case because she has found clues that might lead her to the real killers . Nice . Pretty weak way to generate suspense , but overall with some good twists this is still a pretty entertaining thriller .
In a time when horror movies have become direct-to-video crap or cheesy first-run crap , how is it that the Hellraiser movies are among the least noticed and yet probably the most clever and impressive sequel	The beginning of the fifth Hellraiser sequel raises something of a moral dilemma , which is extremely rare for a horror movie . After the car crash , Trevor , our hero , escapes from the car after it sinks to the bottom of the river and he rushes to the surface to get air , then returns to attempt to save his wife . At that point , my immediate reaction was that he deserves any suffering that comes to him , since he left his wife on the bottom of the river to go and try to save himself . On the other hand , it probably wouldn't have done much good had he remained down there and lost consciousness right there with her . I guess that's why they tell you on the airlines to secure your own oxygen mask and THEN help your kid . But while this early scene inspired in me an unusually complex combination of thoughts and emotions , it unfortunately is unable to escape from the destructive presence of reality on the possibility of it happening the way it did . I am willing to suspend disbelief on the premise that the guy was screaming at his wife underwater through the window , watching her drown right in front of his blurred eyes and therefore not necessarily able to think all that clearly , but on the other hand , riverbeds have an overwhelming tendency to be covered with big , round , hard , window-breaking rocks . When the investigation begins , things start to get a little strange and we begin to realize that there is something weird about what happened in that crash . Evidently the car was found with the doors open , which puts some serious holes in the story about not being able to get the doors open to save his wife . It turns out that he has come back with a spotted memory , and that the crash that we saw at the beginning of the movie may not have been exactly how the event unfolded . Things seem to have happened that he doesn't remember . I found it highly amusing that the detective that always gave him a hard time because he didn't believe his story was named Detective Gibbons , just because I recently took an Anthropology class in which I learned what a ' gibbon ' is . I would NOT have been able to keep my cool with this guy though , who was hugely overacting and throwing harsh accusations which were not necessarily unfounded but definitely a little too confident and , if accusations can be this , a little too accusatory . The best thing about this installment in the Hellraiser series is that it works on a psychological level with the main character . Granted , this is nothing new in the horror genre , but it is done very well here . We never know when he is seeing reality , when he's dreaming , when he's having delusions , inaccurate flashbacks , and there is plenty of opportunity for lots of twists and turns , and thankfully these opportunities are not ignored . I hate it when movies do that ( see Hollow Man ) . Because of this , we never expect things like the startlingly effecting scare in the vending machine , one of my favorite scares in the movie . Pinhead has thankfully been given a much more prevalent role than he had in the rather disappointing Hellraiser Inferno , the least Hellraiser movie of all of them , and it's morbidly pleasing to see some of the familiar Cenobites return , like Chatterer . The movie closes with the old ' leave him and take me ' cliché , but as a whole it is a quality entry in the Hellraiser saga . It is well-written , well-thought out ( almost unheard of for a horror movie these days ) , and entertaining , and most importantly , it is more than just another cash in on a successful series . There are a lot of horror series ' that are well past their time to pass away , but as long as they keep putting this much thought and creativity into the Hellraiser films , I say there is infinite opportunity for sequels .
Is this a spoof ?	While Shrek 2 was another great , confectionery romp like the first one , the homages to old fairy tales and other movies are approaching the area of campy spoofs . I was just waiting for Leslie Nielsen to pop up somewhere . Fiona pulls a layer of mud off of Shrek's face , kissing him upside down like Mary Jane Watson in Sam Raimi's Spiderman , The Little Mermaid washes onto shore and Fiona throws her back to the sharks as though she were trying to steal Shrek away from her , she and Shrek enjoy a romantic time lit by the light of lots of little Tinkerbells in jars , Fiona becomes the Lord of the Ring , and Shrek later in the movie cooks up and is helped out by the Stay-Puft Gingerbread Man . This is all great stuff that movie buffs are sure to love , but a lot of the humor has gone downhill , not necessarily in the maturity department ( the first movie was pretty immature at many points ) , but in the tact department ( the first movie was immature , but tactfully so ) . As best as I can remember , for example , there were no loud fart jokes in part 1 that blew Shrek's untucked shirt out behind him from the force of the wind . Shrek has gone from moderate irritation and sarcasm to downright anger , and much of the entire first half of the movie is saved by a masterful performance from Antonio Banderas as the voice of Puss in Boots . Which is too bad , too , because once the movie gets going it goes right back to the same level of animated superiority of its predecessor . In Shrek 2 , Shrek and Fiona are now married , as we saw in the end of the last movie , which necessarily brings the narrative to a slightly higher level of maturity , since the main characters are past a major point in their lives that most of their target audience is not even close to . Donkey has returned , uninvited again , but dearly loved by the audience at least as much as he is for some reason detested by Shrek . I think that the main problem with Shrek 2 is that the conflict is so minimized . Shrek is married now , and the prevailing conflicts in the movie are things like meeting the in-laws and keeping Fiona from being drugged into falling in love with another , more politically correct man , while part 1 was all about the fairy tale quests to slay the fire-breathing dragon and save the beautiful princess . Of course , even though he's married , Shrek is still an ogre and still has the manners and demeanor of an ogre , which are for some reason epitomized at a dinner with his new in-laws in order to create sort of a Meet the Parents type scene , except that the King , who Shrek is supposed to impress , apparently has table manners not too dissimilar from Shrek's . Maybe the movie's trying to say that there's really not much difference between royalty and ogres . In Shrek 1 , Shrek saved the princess and won her heart ( thanks in no small part to the fact that she has a little condition that turned her into a ogre at night ) . Now , in the sequel , the real Prince Charming , who Aesop might dictate should have saved her in the first place , goes to the highest chamber in the storybook castle to rescue her and finds only a gender-confused wolf there reading the latest copy of Pork Illustrated , and is understandably furious . Thus begins his quest to find the princess and win her heart , even though she has already been rescued ( from the imprisonment imposed by the very parents Shrek is out to impress ) and her heart already won . Responding to a summons from Fiona's parents , who want to meet their daughter's new husband , they go on a long journey to reach the kingdom of Far , Far , Away ( with Donkey all the while asking if they're there yet ) , and are met with the expected shock of a kingdom and two parents not ready to welcome back two enormous , hideous ogres , and all manner of hilarious mayhem ensues . Joan Rivers also makes a cameo as Joan Rivers , commentating on the outfits of the stars as they parade down the red carpet . And by the way , who has a grudge against poor Pinocchio ? Not only does he get caught wearing women's underwear , but it's a thong and he lies about it ! And then , to add injury to insult , as it were , he gets turned into a real boy just in time to suffer a fall that would have shattered most of his brand new bones , and then he gets turned back into a puppet again ! What did he ever do to deserve such shabby treatment ? ?
Hellraiser III is by far the best of the series so far . It is the first one that has any decent acting ( although still not great ) , good direction , and even a fairly respectable story .	Pinhead has returned , and again he wants to destroy that pesky puzzle box , the door to Hell , so that he will never have to go back . His return to the world of the living is fascinatingly done with an updated version of that horrific rotating pillar that we're all so familiar with by this point . Kevin Bernhardt plays J . P . Monroe , an arrogant night club owner ( the ' Boiler Room ' ) who is at first persuaded by Pinhead ( still trapped in the stone pillar ) to help him come fully back to life in the traditional Hellraiser manner . As is to be expected , not everything goes perfectly as planned , and the ensuing madness is both sickening and morbidly entertaining . Ashley Laurence has been mercifully removed from the cast ( probably saving the film from failing like the first two did ) , except for a thankfully brief cameo in which her character is referred to in order to learn about the history of the box and to prove its capabilities . Hellraiser III gives the series a much needed jump-start , following a weak but cult classic original , as well as an even weaker first sequel . Unfortunately , the ' Female Cenobite ' ( mysteriously left unnamed ) , ' Chatterer , ' and ' Butterball ' ( both of whom probably SHOULD have been left unnamed ) are gone , but a series of about half a dozen new Cenobites keeps the hellish imagery alive . I think that one of the better elements of this installment in the series is that they show all of the new Cenobites being created . However , when Doc becomes a Cenobite ( ' Camerahead ' ) , some of his dialogue refers to his life as a human , contradicting the previously established characteristic of the Cenobites that they don't remember their human selves . In the anti-religious tradition of the Hellraiser series ( remember ' Jesus Wept , ' from part I ? That was by far my favorite ) , some of Pinhead's antics in the church near the end of the film are great . When the priest holds up the cross to him , Pinhead melts it in the poor guy's hand , which is a terribly cruel thing to do , but at the same time he utters an absolutely brilliant bit of dialogue , ' Thou shalt not bow down to any graven image . ' Words to live by , people . After that , Pinhead's self-crucifixion scene was wonderfully sickening , yet his intentions in doing that were both clearly presented and morbidly farcical . Jesus was crucified , paying for man's sins , thereby saving mankind from damnation and becoming the subject of countless masses of people's unquestioning adoration , inspiring Pinhead to crucify himself and state that ' I am the way . ' This is great stuff . Besides all that , I think that this installment had some of the best death scenes of the series so far , particularly in the nightclub . Some of that was almost physically painful to watch , a sure sign of success for a horror film . Not only was that Boiler Room massacre convincingly portrayed , but writer Peter Atkins also had the excellent idea to have poor Terri walk through the masses of mutilated bodies after the massacre had ended . Pretty uplifting stuff , huh ? A little too gory and bloody ? Don't moan about that , it's not supposed to be good , clean , fun . This is a horror film , and by definition , horror films are supposed to be horrible . And Hellraiser III achieves this horror better than either of the two that preceded it , finally leaving the viewer satisfied . Even when you think you are watching what will be a cheesy ending , a plot twist makes it good again , saving us ( and the film , technically ) from a goofy and patronizing ? happily-ever-after . ' This was a very good horror film . It's almost worth watching the first two just to get to this one , and hopefully this unexpected but very welcome upward trend will continue with the rest of the series .
. and the Star Wars saga makes a massive comeback ! !	It was no small task for George Lucas to make up for that ridiculous mess that bore the title of Episode I . While Episode II : Attack of the Clones was far from unflawed , it is vastly superior to its predecessor , providing for some serious entertainment and a huge relief for Star Wars fans around the world . Sadly , Star Wars has sank to the level at which many people are almost ashamed to like the new films anymore , an unfortunate fact which has come about solely as a result of Episode I , and the failure of Episode I is due in no small part to the abysmally moronic addition of a character like Jar Jar Binks , who is easily one of the most popularly hated characters ever put on screen . On the other hand , Episode II runs a strong campaign as the worst script of any Star Wars film which has ever been or ( hopefully ) ever WILL be made . What you have in Episode II is a spectacular piece of computer animation that presents some spectacular battle scenes , chases , landscapes and settings , new and interesting aliens , etc . This part of the film is just as fascinating as was expected , and the hand to hand combat scenes as well as the aerial maneuvering scenes are wonderfully well-done and entertaining . However , there is the addition of a love scene between Anakin Skywalker and Senator Amidala . Now , the Jedi have long since been know to be forbidden to express the emotions of love , hate , anger , etc . , so it is obvious from the outset that the addition of a love story into the Star Wars world can only have negative results . This awful love story couples with the MASSIVE amount of confusing political dialogue that makes up much of the film , which can do nothing but confuse all but the most dedicated and knowledgeable Star Wars fans . I like that Lucas has placed so much emphasis on expanding the story that he has already created , but at the same time it is disappointing that people who watch the movie for some good entertainment are being alienated in favor of the stereotypical Star Wars geek . When I first saw posters in theaters advertising Episode II , and saw the tagline ' A Jedi Shall Not Know Anger . Nor Hatred . Nor Love , ' along with a romantic picture of Anakin and Amidala , my heart sank . This is exactly the kind of thing that ruins one Bruckheimer film after another , and now it's going to plague the Star Wars saga . Needless to say , my expectations for the film sank even lower than they did as a result of Episode I , because in that poster I saw the makings of a cheesy teenage romance . When I actually saw the film , I found that it far exceeded the disappointing quality of its predecessor , while at the same time being continually brought down by the hideous romance . I always try to keep an open mind about movies , especially ones which have such a dedicated fan base and such a huge reputation as the Star Wars films , but this is by far one of the worst presentations of a love story that I have ever seen . Every bit of dialogue that takes place between Anakin and Amidala is pathetically clichéd , rendering their romance ( or lack thereof ) nothing more than an anchor that held the rest of the film down . There is not a single memorable acting performance throughout the entire film , either . It was good to see Samuel L . Jackson adding his part to the series again , but even his small part was wooden and mechanical , as though he were either reading cue cards or reciting lines that he had rehearsed hundreds of times . Hayden Christensen is the most disappointing addition to Episode II besides the ridiculous Jar Jar ( I'll get to him later ) , mumbling his way through his lines and at some points even sounding like a pouting 10-year-old who's had his toys taken away ( the line ' Someday I'll be the most powerful Jedi ever ' is impressive in a tired cliché kind of way , but he delivers it like a whiny little kid ) . Natalie Portman was never convincing for a second in any of her role in the Star Wars saga as a young Senator , and in Episode II she delivers more of the same childish political mumbo jumbo as in the last movie , but at least she TRIES to take herself seriously , which Christensen doesn't . She's about as right for this role as Denise Richards was for the freaking nuclear physicist in The World Is Not Enough , one of the worst Bond films ever created , and in Episode II her character is made even less convincing as she goofily grins her way through this dumb teen crush . The film ultimately builds to a wildly impressive shot of the Clone armies loading in perfect lineup onto the massive star ships which are to take them to their attack , and then we get a sort of Lord of the Rings ending , in a way , in that the movie ends right where it seems to be beginning . While the beginning of the end credits are accompanied with a bitter sense of disappointment , I can't help thinking that this will wisely add to the expectation of Episode III , and I don't hold this ending against the film as a whole any more than I did that of The Lord of the Rings . With the exception of the astonishingly idiotic romantic subplot , Episode II is a hugely entertaining piece of cinematography with many references to the Star Wars story as a whole , which are sure to delight dedicated fans ( although not all of these allusions are impressive or even necessary ) . Whether you hate the new films just because they don't do justice to the classics or you love them just because they're Star Wars films , there are things here that are just undeniably thrilling ( such as , for example , Obi-Wan's flying leap out the window early in the film to catch the spying droid and , even more , the immensely impressive fight scene where Yoda works his Jedi magic ) . Okay , speaking of Yoda - Yes , he looked completely different than he did in the original series , and YES , he can FIGHT ! His fight scene was by far the most memorable in the film , and it ended in a brilliant way ( in which neither opponent lost , and neither won ) . It was Episode II's version of the hugely impressive fight scene between Qui-Gon Jinn , Obi-Wan Kenobi , and Darth Maul in Episode I , and this year's version hugely improved upon that one in that , instead of the pathetically disappointing end of the fight that we got in Episode I , we have a much more mature and memorable end in Episode II . And , of course , let's not forget Jar Jar Binks . This is a character that was added to the saga in Episode I to the gigantic disappointment to the movie going public in general , and because he has been bashed probably in every review ever written about this film or the last one , I will instead give my theory as to why he was in Episode II at all . George Lucas applied his brilliant imagination ( which , by the way , is FAR superior to his directing skills ) to the creation of Episode I , wanting to come up with a unique character to renew interest in the series . He came up with Jar Jar , put him in the film , and was greeted with massive disgust , even ( and , indeed , ESPECIALLY ) from his most dedicated fans . It was revealed fairly early that he planned to bring the character back in Episode II , which left ME feeling that he didn't care what the public thought if it went against his own preferences . However , when the movie was released , we find that Jar Jar has a hugely down-sized role , which makes it clear that Lucas knew that he is a hated character and should not be in the movie . However , he can't simply take him out entirely because that would be like admitting that he was wrong , so basically I think that Lucas left him in , only a little bit , to avoid making what would essentially be an internal apology . No one wanted to see Jar Jar , but removing him completely would have been too much of a step backwards for Lucas to take and still maintain some cinematic integrity . As a whole , Episode II clearly has its share of positive and negative qualities , and it carries the rare distinction of containing what seems to be more than its share of both . There are thrilling battle and fight scenes delivered in highly impressive digital photography and interspersed with god-awful love scenes and flat , rigid dialogue pretty much throughout . In comparison to the original films , especially the 1977 Star Wars , Episode II is little more than an attempt to pass an inferior story along under the guise of some impressive special effects , but as far as the new films , Episode II comes through to revive the series from the dismal effects of the disappointing Episode I . And it's a good thing , too , because after Episode I , the Star Wars series badly needed a good boost .
A classic crime comedy that evidently can't be updated .	The humor in this movie is not only British , which is notoriously misunderstood by American audiences ( and vice versa ) , which is odd because both the writer and director were American , but it is also now five decades old . Only the best American comedies have lasted anywhere near that long ( consider , for example , the sad fate of many of the movies that people thought were really funny in the 80s ? Police Academy , anyone ? ) . The reason The Ladykillers has not only survived but has now been remade is because the comedy in it is not only effective , but it is intelligent , and it is very difficult not to be impressed by a comedy with a brain . Alec Guinness is in top form as the leader of the gang , whose members reflects criminals of all walks of life . The ingenious plan is to rent out a room from a sweet old lady while they pull off a heist . The comedy , for me , lies in the difference between what is planned and what is played out , particularly in the difficulties that the gang of criminals have in outsmarting a sweet old lady who acts like a grandmother supervising a group of unruly grandchildren . The problem that the movie has is that the pace is very slow and much of the comedy has faded over the years , but structurally and intellectually it remains a respectable film , even more now in comparison to its disastrous remake . What went wrong in the remake is that they did not maintain who the character of Mrs . Wilberforce was , because it was the juxtaposition of her as a frail old woman surrounded by toughened criminals that made it funny when things kept going wrong in their plan . In the remake she is replaced by Mrs . Munson , a tough-talking woman who was to be feared from the outset . There is no irony in being overpowered by someone more powerful than yourself from the outset , which I imagine is why the remake also featured Marlon Wayans and a case of irritable bowel syndrome , which I have never seen used in an even remotely amusing way . While the original film may be a bit too slow for modern audiences , it is indeed charming the way 87-year-old Mrs . Wilberforce continually foils their carefully thought out plans , many times inadvertently . Alec Guinness is wonderful as the band's leader , wearing outrageous false teeth , nearly rivaling Lon Chaney as the man of a thousand faces , and Peter Sellers is one of the criminals as well . I'm no expert about British comedies or Alec Guinness ' early works , but I can certainly tell enough from watching this movie that the Coen Brothers ' remake did nothing to impress the British about Hollywood's respect for the classics .
Goodnight , Clark ?	It's easy to see the elements of this movie that led to its Luke-warm at best public reception . As Julie Ng's wonderful making-of documentary included on the DVD explains , it quietly disappeared from theaters two weeks after its release . I can easily see people being put off by a movie about a guy who raises vast numbers of rats in his basement and then becomes a sort of lord and master of them , teaching them to follow his orders and to do things like climb into briefcases and chew up tires at his command . On the other hand , I can also see a lot of people seeing stuff like that in this movie and then being unable to look past it and see how well made and performed this film is . Crispin Glover is an incredibly impressive actor , and he fits into this role so comfortably that it is amazing to me that it took so many other actors turning the part down before it was offered to him . I think many of the other actors would have been good in the role as well , most notably Doug Hutchison , who played Percy in The Green Mile , but Crispin Glover was just outstanding . My favorite parts of the movie were the scenes at the very beginning , such as the one scene where Willard has just walked up the stairs and his sick mother calls from the other room , asking why he's up so late and what he's been doing . The camera is focused on Willard's face the entire time , and is a great example of how amazingly well Crispin Glover is able to act with his face . Willard has been living with his sick mother , caring for her and working at an office job at a company that his late father owned . He lived a very isolated life , leaving home only to go to work , where his boss is constantly trying to figure out how to get rid of him . His mother insults him with careless but deeply damaging comments like maybe he would be able to find a girl if he had a better name . In one scene she decides that maybe Clark would be a better name , so she's going to call him Clark from now on . It's not hard to see why he's a little " off . " Willard's mother hears rats crawling around in the basement and is always yelling at Willard to go do something about it , so in a monumental act of rebellion he decides to feed and cultivate them rather than killing them . He escapes the dreariness and depression of his everyday life by raising these rats , which are his only real friends , and ultimately uses them to exact his revenge on the world by which he has been so abused . This , of course , is where the movie turns decisively toward cult status . I haven't seen the original Willard at the time of this writing , but this remake has certainly earned itself cult classic status , which it could never transcend but which I think it deserves to . It is very competently made , richly directed and acted , but the subject matter prevents it from being accepted by wider tastes . It's not a movie for all audiences , but is very well made within its genre . Rob Zombie's House of 1000 Corpses is another recent example of a movie that is spectacularly well made but was not accepted well by the public , probably because the majority of movie-going audiences just don't have the appetite for that kind of raw horror anymore . Rob Zombie just doesn't care , he made the kind of movie that he wanted to see , and he deserves respect for that . Similarly , Willard is a movie that believes in itself , which is certainly more than can be said of much of the empty drivel released by Hollywood these days .
Philosophy 101 - Serling style .	There are times when I start thinking about strange possibilities and different experiences of existence , such as whether people with different eye colors see the world exactly the same way . Really , if blue eyed people experienced colors one way and brown eyed people experienced them another way , we would really have no way of knowing , because everything would look normal to everyone . That's a rather childish example , but when I start feeling existential I sometimes wonder if we are all part of someone's imagination or if we are some tiny part of an unimaginably bigger world . The religious implications here are pretty obvious , but Shadow Play has nothing to do with them . The idea that we are all just figments of someone's ( or something's ? ) imagination is not a new proposal , of course , but Serling has taken the premise and turned it into a pretty entertaining half hour story . Dreams and their meanings is an almost endlessly fascinating subject , and has been explored extensively in the annals of psychology , as well as in film , television , and literature . Wes Craven blurred the lines between reality and nightmare in his Nightmare on Elm Street films , and long before that , Serling explored the causes and effects of recurring nightmares more than once here on the outskirts of the Twilight Zone . It doesn't seem that the show is really seeking any answers , but is instead just presenting a situation in which a man is having recurring nightmares in which he has been sentenced to death , and is basically trying to convince the people around him to help themselves by helping him . It is a brilliantly ironclad dilemma he is in . Imagine being on death row and trying to convince the guards and police around you that if they go through with your execution , they will all disappear . " You're all in my imagination ! If you execute me you'll cease to exist ! " The feeling of helplessness that he must be suffering is unimaginable ! Granted , I've had dreams where I sank like a rock to the bottom of the ocean or fell off a building or something , and I always wake up at the point of death , and while it's scary , it's also an enormous relief when I wake up and realize I'm safe in my bed . Still , the nightly anticipation of electrocution's gotta make it hard to get to sleep at night . Although personally , rather than trying to convince the guards to cancel my execution , I would just stick my arm through the bars of my cell and say - " Come on , pinch me ! See what happens ! "
Houston , we have a problem . . .	In one of the simplest and yet most effective twilight zones , a passenger jet full of people unexpectedly accelerates to unheard of speeds and suddenly finds itself transported into the distant past . Time travel is one of the few endlessly entertaining storytelling premises , and although this story is presented almost entirely through dialogue , it is still one of the more vintage twilight episodes that I've seen . The first half of the episode is a little too simplistic , if only because we are trying to believe an airplane is travelling at thousands of knots , and yet there is not the slightest bit of vibration or noise in the cockpit . It looks more like they're sitting on the ground on a movie set , which they are . But when the time travel takes place , I have to think that it had some inspiration on some later time travel movies , most notably the Back to the Future films , given the acceleration to a certain speed and the rather violent shock that accompanies the , uh , temporal displacement , if you will . The payoff of the show is nothing more than a primitive go-motion dinosaur and some stock footage of the World's Fair in New York ( which gives it the feeling that the entire episode was made to fit around that aerial stock footage of the World's Fair like a raindrop around a bit of dust ) , but this is an excellent example of how a simple idea and some quality writing and performances can make for a highly entertaining half hour . Excellent !
The interesting story and the quality performances ( mostly from George Clooney and Ving Rhames ) save Out of Sight from being a run-of-the-mill action film .	( SPOILERS ) In an excellent opening sequence , George Clooney walks out of a large building , roughly yanks his tie off , and throws it to the ground with all his might in a way that only George can . This guy is one of the best actors working right now , and his characteristic performance in Out of Sight is clearly no exception . The unique bank robbery that follow the tie scene is both innovative and surprising , because you just don't expect George to get caught just because his crappy car won't start , especially after such a flawlessly executed robbery . The thing that sets Out of Sight apart from other action romance films is that it's got a sufficiently original love story that is propelled by a uniquely presented storyline . The way that time is twisted around in the presentation of the film makes it more interesting , because it gives the audience a way to go back and see what happens before that hilarious opening sequence . Jennifer Lopez provides the only downfall of the film , horribly miscast in her role but luckily the quality of the rest of the cast makes up for the terrible black mark that she causes . She's just too cutesy and too obviously put in the movie for no other reason than to have a good looking celebrity in her role in the film , despite the fact that she clearly doesn't belong . Casting her in this film parallels the absolute stupidity of casting Denise Richards as a nuclear physicist in The World Is Not Enough , the 19th Bond film which , sadly , was otherwise too weak to survive her laughable performance . Out of Sight not only presents excellent character development but also a very complex plot , which is one of the best parts of the film . The diamond heist that makes up the majority of the latter part of the film is particularly well done , even if the criminals were a little blown out of proportion . But at least the group of criminals presented is fairly diverse . You have a leader , a squirrelly know-it-all guy from whom the entire heist is nearly stolen , and they even threw in a clumsy fat guy who was more interested in the big steaks in the fridge of the house they had broken into than he was in stealing the diamonds . It was particularly amusing the way that that guy died , by shooting himself in the head after tripping on his way up the stairs to get George , who he had at gunpoint ( which is weird , because I could have sworn that that scene was in Suicide Kings ) . At any rate , the thing that really made the romantic element of the film work ( the tired theme of the law officer falling for the con ) was that it was more realistically presented than they usually are . In general , you have the law officer pulling some strings or breaking the law in his or her own clever way to win the con's freedom , legally or not , but this was not the case in Out of Sight , and it's a good thing , too . Instead , in one of the best endings of any film in years , George is given a ride back to jail ( after having been captured by Lopez after the botched diamond heist ) in the back of a van with Samuel L . Jackson , who just happens to be a famous break out artist . It's not long before their brief conversation reveals to George the opportunity that Lopez put in front of him by pairing him up with Sam , and this sure as hell beats a riding-off-into-the-sunset ending . It leaves a huge hole for a sequel , but as much as I loved this film , I hope that they don't make a sequel . First of all , it would have to be DAMN good to do this movie justice , and second of all , a sequel just isn't necessary . Out of Sight leaves you with a smile on your face , because of what you can foresee about George's future as well as the cleverness of the entire film , and there's really no reason to go any further . Enjoy the film as it is , because quality cinema like this doesn't come along very often .
This is weird ? a school comedy with some thought put into it .	( spoilers ) The film Rushmore had a lot to say about relationships and loyalty . It dealt both with romantic relationships as well as friendships , and the importance of honesty in those relationships . Even more than that however , the film was about the depths that people will sink to when they feel cheated out of a romantic relationship , and the massive retaliation that may come to the person who benefited from that person's broken heart . Max Fischer , who was the subject that was deprived of a coveted partner , illustrates this idea with the noteworthy quote , ' War does funny things to men . ' Rushmore is the story of an extremely geeky high school kid who develops an unusually strong crush on a new teacher named Rosemary Cross at Rushmore Academy , the school that he attends . He begins to go to extraordinary lengths to achieve Ms . Cross's attention and to impress her despite their significant age difference , and after a while he begins to become preoccupied with these efforts . He wants to build a huge aquarium on school campus in her honor , and one of his sponsors is a rich businessman named Herman Blume . Unfortunately , Max's infatuation is not returned to him by Ms . Cross , who feels that they are obviously not right for each other . When she begins dating Blume after having denied Max's romantic advances , Max declares war on him . When Ms . Cross and Herman began dating , he had recently had a rough break-up , and is more than likely a little lovesick about it , and possibly feels like a victim . As a result , he seems to want to project his pain onto someone else , and Max is the one that this anger falls on . It seems as though his relationship with Ms . Cross is as much a way for him to lash out at someone else as it is a romantic endeavor . One way that this is shown is when Herman was walking through a playground where a few young kids are playing basketball . One of them shoots the ball for the basket , and for no other apparent reason than just because he was there , Herman blocks the kid's shot . This crudely symbolizes his efforts to block Max's efforts towards Ms . Cross , and also displays Herman's side of the war that love has provoked between himself and Max , who until now had no problem with one another . The other side of this war is Max's retaliation from having the object of his affection taken from him by another man . This is a major turning point in the film , where it switches from containing elements of a romantic comedy to much darker situations of anger and contempt between two people fighting over the same woman . Neither Max nor Herman does anything serious at first that could alter the other person's life ; Herman runs over Max's bicycle with his car , Max delivers bees into Herman's room at one point , etc . However , Max does go as far as to tell Herman's wife that he is involved with this other woman , which may have been overstepping his bounds a little bit . Being younger , Max is not as wary of the consequences of an act like this , he just wants to do anything possible to hurt the person who hurt him . This is an example of the funny things that war does to men . All of the characters in Rushmore do a lot of very effective acting with their faces and body language , and there are also a lot of scenes in which there is little to no dialogue . Max is always dressed very sharply , unless he is dressed up in costume for one of his plays . Also , for a fifteen-year-old boy , Max speaks with surprising maturity . Even though he is a terrible student , he is obviously talented , and seems to feel superior to a lot of the older people around him . One good example is , of course , Herman . It seems that Max feels that he is superior to Herman and this intensifies his anger when Ms . Cross denies his amorous advances and instead dates Herman . The play that Max directed which was shown near the end of the film seems to almost summarize the entire film . The play was about a military war which Max himself had a leading role in , and it represented the war between himself and Herman Blume . At the end of the play , after countless casualties ( i . e . Herman's marriage , any chance Max may ever have had with Ms . Cross , etc ) , Max's character is faced with a woman from the opposing army , and they are pointing rifles at each other . They make a verbal truce with each other , almost romantically . Offstage , this girl seems to be the person that Max may be starting to have feelings for , showing that he has overcome his obsession with Ms . Cross . He has found someone within his reach and looks like he has finally found a way to be happy ? a good ending to a great film .
Every once in a while a film comes along that stands apart from all others made in years . The Matrix did it last year , and The Cell has done it in 2000 .	The last film that provided a vivid and disturbing look at what insanity is probably like was In Dreams . In that movie , you didn't see insanity , you were THERE . Now The Cell comes along with an updated and much more disturbing portrayal of the inside of the mind of a psychotic killer . The opening scene takes you into the seemingly innocent mind of a comatose little boy , and the things that Catherine Deane ( Jennifer Lopez ) sees are first fascinating and then terrifying . The things that she later sees in the mind of Vincent Stargher ( Vincent D'Onofrio ) are amazingly imaginative and fascinating , most of this stuff has never been seen in film before . The story of The Cell is not exactly something that is really groundbreaking . In fact , it is basically the same as the story in The Silence of the Lambs . You have a killer in custody and these people have to enter his mind to find a female victim who is currently in danger of losing her life . The only real difference between the foundation of the plots is that in The Silence of the Lambs , you have to enter the mind of a killer to find a different killer as well as his current victim , while in The Cell , you have to enter the mind of a killer to find his own victim . However , despite the unfortunately weak story , The Cell completely revolutionizes the genre of the psychological thriller . None that have ever been made even come close to it . Also , the film had good direction and was extremely well acted . Vince Vaughn delivers another of his characteristically excellent performances ( he was even good as Norman Bates in the pathetic 1998 re-make of Psycho ) , and even Jennifer Lopez puts forth the second good effort of her career ( the other being the great Out of Sight ) . Nothing can be said of the cinematography in The Cell to give it sufficient credit , it was imaginative and fascinatingly done and is unparalleled by anything ever seen in cinematic history . The Cell is an incredibly well-made film , and it deserves to be recognized .
Outstanding , O-U-T-S-T-A-N-D-I-N-G , outstanding .	Spellbound tells the story of the national spelling bee , showing things that you don't really think of when you think of a contest like that , if you ever do at all . A lot of people think of spelling bees as contests for nerdy introverts with little to no friends and who spend entirely too much time with a dictionary . Well , this movie disproves some preconceptions but also solidifies some other ones , but either way , it tells a fascinating story of eight kids on their way to the national spelling contest . I was a pretty successful spelling bee contestant myself when I was about 11 years old ; nothing near the level seen in this movie , but enough to partly relate to what these kids were going through . The thing that you have to keep in mind is that in the national contest , every single word , seemingly in almost any language , is fair game in this contest . This is what would have killed me . I have an uncanny ability to spell , sometimes even words that I've never heard of ( growing up and going to elementary school , high school , and college , I discovered an odd ability to be able to spell words that I'd never heard and couldn't define ) , but things in other languages , especially with spelling oddities like French , and medical terms will always kill me . That's the thing that impressed me the most about these kids , that they were able to spell words not only that could easily be spelled in several different ways ( given the many sounds of letters like a , e , u , etc . ) , but also words that were scientific or medical terms . At some points , it almost seemed cruel the words that these poor kids were asked to spell . Even more cruel , however , was the way at least one kids parents treated him to prepare him for the upcoming spelling bee . Sure , it's one thing for them to want their kids to be successful , but there is a point where you are pushing too hard and going too far . This poor kid ( the Indian kid , I can't remember his name ) was forced by his father to spell literally thousands of words in preparation for the upcoming spelling bee , literally doing almost nothing else . I can understand a desire to win , even if the grand prize wasn't a cool $10 , 000 , but there comes a point where you are pushing too hard , possibly setting the poor kid up for failure if he / she doesn't win . Every time this kid walked up to the microphone to spell a word , they showed his father in the audience , hands together praying , and maybe it's just me , but I got a feeling , probably from the way he had treated his son like a machine while preparing for the competition , that he was praying for success and not for his son . Sad . I liked the profiles of all the players in preparation for the spelling bee . By taking only eight of the contestants and telling a more complete story of who they are ( there is some debate about how they chose such a small group and managed to get the winner in there ) , because it brings this enormous competition down to a more understandable level , so that we can get an idea for what it's like to compete . When I was a kid , I was the only kid in I think three schools or three counties who never misspelled a word , and I was certainly humbled by these kids competing on a much more massive scale and spelling words that I had then and have no now chance of ever spelling correctly . I would never be able to make it as far as they did . Watching the movie in the state of mind of having been successful in a spelling bee myself , I was expecting to be able to immediately ramble out the spellings that these kids got since I'm older and presumably a better speller , but stopped when I realized that I would have gotten that little ding on just about every word ! Why the one kid was stumbling with something as easy as ' wheedle , ' however , I can't imagine . Is there more than one way to spell that word ? You'd think that sports fans would enjoy a movie like this since it's all about competition , but don't be too sure of it . I have something of a blockhead of a roommate who literally watches sports ( ANY kind of sports ) for 5-6 hours a day , a nauseating amount in my opinion , but refused to even be in the room while this movie was on . Poor guy . This may not be true of all sports fans , but my roommate is a hardcore sports fanatic , claims to love anything that is about competition and proving yourself better than someone else , but apparently not if the competition has any sort of cognitive content . I guess if you have to use your brain the competition is disqualified , as it were . Sad . ( spoilers ) Fans of Spellbound can't really claim that this movie has some edge-of-your-seat suspense , but I think it definitely will have you trying to guess who the winner is and then throwing up your arms when that person spells out . It's a hugely entertaining competition , you just have to accept it on a different level . There are no injuries , no instant replays , and no highlights , but the contestants all take their respective losses remarkably well ( even that Indian kid's jerk father smiled and congratulated his son when he lost , hopefully still acknowledging his son's astronomical accomplishment even after the cameras stopped rolling ) and , while all of the kids were successful , in my opinion , it's still pretty tense watching the numbers dwindle as the kids become increasingly scared as they go up to the microphone . This is probably not for everyone , but it presents a look into an aspect of life that not a lot of people know about , and I think that that is the most important function of a documentary .
One of the fastest moving action films to come out in years , Enemy of the State grabs the audience and holds on until the end .	Enemy of the State is the unlikely story of Robert Clayton Dean ( Will Smith ) who is the unknowing recipient of a tape showing the politically motivated murder of an uncooperative Senator . Even though the premise is a little bit farfetched , the movie as a whole is so relentlessly entertaining an fun that it is possible to overlook things like that . Will Smith is excellent in his role , and the extensive supporting cast also does a very good job . However , I think that the best quality of this film is the way that it was made . The extensive use of surveillance camera cinematography make the spectacular chase even more paranoid and intense , and the technology displayed in the film is also very impressive . Enemy of the State should be noted especially for the fact that it was able to take a very unlikely premise and turn it into a great action thriller . The way the film was put together allowed for the audience's attention to be entirely consumed while the visually intense film whipped through the story of a man being chased by people he doesn't know so that they can get a tape that he doesn't even know he has . Luckily , Dean is a defiant man , otherwise the agents who came to his door early in the film would have had a quick look through his purchases , found the tape , and everyone would have lived happily ever after ( except for the Senator who was killed , of course ) . Enemy of the State is just a good action / thriller . It is well made , well-acted , and very interesting and fun to watch . It presents a chase scenario beaten only by the legendary Fugitive , and later rivaled by the excellent Arlington Road . Definitely a must-see for any action fan .
Wait , you mean all I have to do is become God to solve all my problems ? Why didn't I think of that before ? ? ?	Jim Carrey is back to much the same role that he played in The Mask , a timid guy who is trying to get ahead in the world but who seems to be plagued with bad luck . Even when he tries to help a homeless guy from being harassed by a bunch of hoodlums ( and of course they have to be Mexican , obviously ) , his good will towards his fellow man backfires . In that case , it wasn't too hard to predict that he was about to have a handful of angry hoodlums , but I like that the movie suggests that things like that shouldn't be ignored . I'm reminded of the episode of Michael Moore's brilliant The Awful Truth , when they had a man lay down on the sidewalk and pretend to be dead and see who would actually stop and make sure he was okay . The results were not very promising , so it's nice to see someone in the movies setting a good example . Jim Carrey plays the part of Bruce Nolan , the nice guy mentioned above whose entire life seems to be falling apart . Or even better , it seems to be breaking up by the blows of bad luck like an asteroid entering the atmosphere ( a little metaphor that comes up when Bruce miraculously finds himself a gigantic news story later in the film ) . Bruce is nearly 40 years old and all he has to show for it is a position as a news reporter of the sort that reports on such exciting news as the local bakery that's seeking to bake the world's biggest cookie . He's desperate to obtain the job of head anchor at the TV station , but he loses his cool on live TV when he hears that the job went to his rival colleague . You have to love how they time the revelation of this news to him seconds before his first live report . Needless to say , he loses his temper on live TV in one of the funniest scenes of the entire film . Morgan Freeman delivers a fantastic performance as the Man himself , displaying a God whose infinite wisdom is somewhat reflected through Freeman's massive talent as an actor . He is the kind of God who takes his job very seriously , but in such a way as to advise his followers ( as well as the viewers of this movie ) that there are times when you need to slow down and do some manual labor in life . I love his line that some of the happiest people in the world come home smelling to high heaven at the end of the day . There are a lot of people in the world ( maybe more than our share in America ) who are so absorbed by their money and their possessions and their jobs and everything that they completely lost touch with the natural side of themselves as humans . One of the biggest strengths is that the movie is able to provide great advice to people in general about improving their lives , and this message is clear and acceptable regardless of the viewer's religion . I , for example , tend to reject organized religion in all forms and I see God and Satan to be metaphors for different aspects of nature and human psychology rather than actual figures who ever lived or continue to live . But despite the fact that I don't believe that God exists as an entity overseeing the universe or as a janitor dressed all in white who mops the floors of his downtown office in his spare time , I was able to appreciate the messages that were delivered in this movie . Jim Carrey's movies display this fantastic evolution that ties them all together and makes the newer ones look even better just because you can see how far he's come . If you compare Bruce Almighty with movies like Ace Ventura ( both of which I loved , by the way ) or a lot of what he did before he got into film , it's amazing how far he's come . He has moved from cheesy TV comedy to cheesy comedic films to comedies that are truly intelligent and meaningful like this film as well as others like The Truman Show , Man on the Moon , and The Majestic ( easily one of his greatest films ever ) . Jim Carrey has unmistakably moved from the cheesy comedy of his past to become one of the most important comic actors working today . Jennifer Aniston also once again provides an excellent addition to the movie ( as she did in the side-splitting Office Space ) as Bruce's girlfriend , who becomes increasingly exasperated by Bruce's growing stress about his life as well as his negligence to ask her to marry him . There is definitely some low-brow comedy in the film that doesn't really fit with the importance of the film's meaning or the quality of the delivery , such as the dog reading the newspaper on the toilet and the whole monkey scene , but it was definitely pretty nice to see Ace Ventura's friend Spike make a cameo appearance . As Stephen King very well knows , it's always nice to see familiar characters . It's almost like seeing family again . Bruce is endowed with the powers of God for a given period of time so that he can understand life a bit better , and he says a lot about himself when he uses the powers only for his own purposes rather than to help all of the people who pray to him . The thing I love about this is that , like I said before , religion is absent from my life , but I was able to watch this and learn a lot about myself as well by thinking about what kinds of things I would have done had I been endowed with such powers . The movie allows us to learn vicariously this way , which empowers the message even more . The scenes that involve the news station are easily the funniest in the entire film , such as the scene when Bruce loses his temper about the anchor position , the Jimmy Hoffa scene ( who was conveniently buried with an original birth certificate and a complete set of dental records ) , the scene where Bruce's rival colleague is made to go nuts on camera , and my favorites , the ones at the beginning and the end involving the local bakery's cooking . The movie has plenty of time for Carrey to deliver some excellent jokes , such as when he says to God ( who reveals that he's the janitor , the proprietor , the electrician , etc ) that his Christmas parties must be real bashes , and to be careful about drinking , because on of him might need a ride home ! I also loved the end when he says that behind every great man is a woman rolling her eyes . A little too true , and as Gallagher would add , behind every great man is also an amazed mother-in-law . Bruce Almighty is one of the more memorable comedies to have come out for quite a while , and is probably the only directly religious that I can remember seeing that I am anxious to buy on DVD to add to my personal collection . It is a comedy written and performed in good taste , but with enough relatively low-brow humor to keep the kids entertained . This is a meaningful comedy for the whole family , which is becoming rarer and rarer these days . In a world that is about to be flogged with yet another American Pie film AND another Scary Movie ( which are only scary because of their sheer barbarous idiocy ) , it's nice to see that there are still people making comedies worth watching . Don't miss this one .
Another great Bond film from Sean Connery .	Connery succeeds the great film Dr . No with another exciting action epic with From Russia With Love . The now traditional opening scene consisted of a training exercise that is far superior to that in The Man With The Golden Gun , which also opened with a training exercise . The plot consists of SPECTRE's plan to steal a Russian encryption decoding machine , and while this installment in the Bond series is not quite as good as Goldfinger , the film that follows it , the action and the story are still much higher quality than the belligerent action messes that Pierce Brosnan starred in as the James Bond of the 1990s . The Austin Powers influence is also fairly heavy in From Russia With Love . The hideous henchwoman # 3 is clearly the influence of Frau Farbissina , and luckily Mike Myers decided to leave out the ridiculous coke-bottle glasses that # 3 wore in From Russia With Love . Also , we can see the origin of Dr . Evil's little death buttons on his desk in this film , as well as a probable source of Mr . Bigglesworth , Dr . Evil's cat , and Dr . Evil's insistence that he will ' not tolerate failure . ' From a technical perspective , From Russia With Love is one of the best Bond films of them all . There was some excellent editing on sound involving that prehistoric tape recorder , and the entire scene on the train near the end of the film , especially the fight scene , is some of the best stuff in any Bond film before or since . The story is also very interesting , much more so than is common or maybe even required . There is an unusual prevalence of the question of who is on whose side and who can be trusted , and at one point , Bond is almost forced to decide between the decoding device which he has sought after all along and the girl , who he is not entirely sure if he can trust . Despite being much better than most of the other Bond films , there were a lot of mistakes in From Russia With Love , or at least several scenes that didn't seem to have been given the high degree of thought that was given to the film as a whole . For example , when Bond and the girl are on the train , he says that it is almost six o'clock , but then when they arrive at the station , it is clearly several hours later ( it is nighttime now ) , and the clock says that it's about 5 : 30 . Besides that , we all remember the scene earlier where the man vehemently insisted that Russian clocks are always right . Also , it wasn't very creative the way that Robert Shaw's character , one of the villains in the film , was chosen by a quick walk-round and a good punch in the gut . And then , of course , we have that mysterious scene where Bond is somehow able to watch the goings on at a secret conference of the bad guys with the inexplicable use of a periscope from beneath the building . You'd think that someone would notice a periscope sticking up through the floor in the corner of the room . From Russia With Love definitely has its share of faults , but it remains a high quality Bond film . It continues the tradition started by Dr . No of ending in with James and the Bond girl in a boat , it has the usual god-awful theme song ( though not quite as bad as some of the others , like The Man With The Golden Gun and Never Say Never Again ) , and it even employs brief use of the same awkward day-for-night photography that we saw in Dr . No , but it is still one of the best of the Bond series .
Top Gun may have been blown a little bit out of proportion , but the performances are so good that it doesn't matter .	Top Gun is a fighter pilot training facility designed to pick out the best fighter pilots and turn them into The Best Of The Best - in particular , to teach them to ' dogfight , ' a skill which seems to have been largely lost due to the convenience of missiles and locking mechanisms . It is clearly a formula film in the now-typical Jerry Bruckheimer fashion , but the performances are excellent , as are the majority of the aerial flight sequences . Even the obligatory romantic subplot is fairly believable due to the quality acting , as well as an excellent 80s soundtrack ( oh , admit it ) . Tom Cruise stars as Maverick Mitchell , a superb fighter pilot with a semi-subconscious and potentially dangerous need to live up to the skill of his father , who mysteriously died in battle . The best scenes in the film , needless to say , are those in the air , both in the training sequences as well as the surprisingly effective final battle . Some of those scenes were a little overdone , though , such as the scene with the inverted mid-flight Polaroid . I realize that they were not exactly flying bi-planes , but I still doubt that those fighter planes could be maneuvered to the point where two of them could literally fly a couple of feet apart like that . However , despite that , I think that the scene achieved its desired effect . The main thing that I did not like about Top Gun was its predictability , which is why I'm not sure if what I am about to say could really qualify as a spoiler . But just in case , here's the obligatory notice - ( spoilers ahead ) . First of all , it's a formula film , so you know that Maverick is going to get the girl ( in a scene that nearly ruined the otherwise good ending ) . But there were other , subtler but not much less obvious things . For example , the film starts off with a training sequence in which a pilot referred to as Cougar freezes up in the plane and nearly kills himself and his co-pilot . Maverick ( of course ) goes back to fly him back to the aircraft carrier on his wing , despite the fact that he was nearly out of fuel . Cougar's near-death experience inspires him to quit so he doesn't get killed and leave his wife and kid fatherless and husbandless . After this scene , it's pretty obvious that Maverick would find himself in a similar situation later in the film . Even more predictable than that was the death of Goose , Maverick's long time friend and co-pilot . As soon as you see him with his wife and kid ( particularly the slow-motion shot of him hugging his son ) , it is so clear that he's going to die that they might as well have put it right into the dialogue - ' You know Goose , I'm really gonna miss you when you get killed in the next Act . ' Despite the predictability , I still really liked Top Gun because of the acting as well as the cinematography . Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer , as Maverick and Iceman , work so well on screen that you could almost compare them to Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh . Besides that , ironically , enough , the romantic subplot actually works here . I'm always complaining about this , but the romance in Bruckheimer films almost never works because it's always so manipulative and awkwardly thrown in . But there was actually some thought put into that element of Top Gun . The imagery and atmosphere , for example , greatly enhanced the relationship between Maverick and Charlie , his female instructor . The romance in Bruckheimer films is usually added for the obvious purpose of widening the audience by appealing to women , but the quality of that part of this film overshadows its inherent purpose , so Bravo , Jerry , the romance didn't suck . But wait , then they throw in a scene with the sweaty pilots all playing shirtless volleyball , occasionally flexing for the passing camera . For shame , Jerry ( yeah you too , Tony ) , you canceled out your good romance scene with THAT little addition . On the other hand , there was also some good comic relief , although some of it may have gone a little too far , such as the ' buzzing the tower ' scenes . I would think that a stunt like that would precipitate some serious disciplinary action from Maverick's superiors , but I have to admit that it was funny . I particularly liked it when the guy in the tower who spilled coffee on himself goes out into the hallway and runs into a young guy carrying a tray of coffee mugs ( ' God DAMN it , that's twice ! ' ) . Adding to this better than average film is a pretty good ending , except for the final scene between Maverick and Charlie , which was just dumb . I liked the way that the rivalry between Maverick and Iceman was eliminated by the final battle scene , rather than having one of them ( it would have been Maverick , of course ) come out as the winner as the other sulks away in defeat . That final battle scene was probably the best part of the film , by the way , especially the extremely skilled editing . Despite the fact that Maverick threw Goose's dog tags into the ocean at the end of the film ( a ridiculous move comparable to when the old Rose stupidly threw that jewel in the ocean at the end of Titanic , severely limiting the already limited satisfaction delivered by that film ) , Top Gun still manages to come off as a quality action film .
A huge success from John Carpenter !	In the Mouth of Madness is one of those horror movies that blurs the line between reality and fantasy in order to create a horror film that creeps more than it shocks . There are several instances in the film where sudden shocks are delivered by things jumping onscreen with a nice shrieking sound , but these are really only there because what horror movie doesn't have these ? That's a horror movie staple , but the film as a whole presents plenty of creepy and spooky stuff that goes beyond simply a lot of cheesy scares . In a lot of ways , In the Mouth of Madness is a situational horror film , which throws its characters into situations that are just horribly creepy . ( spoilers ) When John ( Sam Niell ) and Linda ( Julie Carmen ) are driving down a country road late at night on their way to the theoretically fictional town Hobb's End , they pass a young kid ( who you will probably not recognize as a young Hayden Christensen ) riding a bicycle down the middle of the street with no lights . John is asleep when this happens , and then a few seconds later they pass an old man also riding a bike down the middle of the street , this time in the opposite direction and stone-faced forward like a zombie . Linda grows concerned at this point , obviously wondering what the hell is going on , and then the next thing you know the same old man is in front of them and she hits him . So far , the movie seems to be just paying homage to Stephen King , from which it borrows heavily ( what with the Children of the Corn sequence that this is ) , but there is something creepy about being in a strange place in the dark and suddenly seeing a bicyclist outside in the blackness , riding merrily along . The problem , however , is that the movie presents even the most creepy scenes like this , but then turns right around and trips over itself . After they run down the old man , John is obviously jolted out of sleep , they go back to see if the man's dead , and after he tells them that he's trapped and he won't let him out , he gets right up , gets on his bike , and continues on his way . This all fits with the situation and the movie's plot , but then we see John and Linda get back into the car , and not only does John not even offer to drive since Linda just ran someone down , but he gets back in the passenger seat and goes right back to sleep ! What the hell ! The best scenes in the movie are the ones that deal with stuff from the novels of Sutter Cane ( Stephen King Sutter Cane Stephen King Sutter Cane ? get it ? ) and the way that they seem to drive people insane . The man with the axe slowly crossing a crowded street to John and his boss sitting in a café , the later revelation that that man was Cane's agent , the painting in the hotel where they stay in Hobb's End , the way John kept coming right back to the crowded street of zombies when he was trying to leave Hobb's End , etc . The movie succeeds wonderfully with this creepy stuff , but trips a little when it goes too far , as it did with some more graphic parts like that goofy pulsating door in Cane's office in the church and , more than anything else in the film , the ridiculous monster that the little old lady in the hotel turned into whenever she was spending quality time with her husband . But on the whole , In the Mouth of Madness sits comfortably within the top 5 % or 10 % of horror films , even the ending was satisfactory . I have a strange fascination with movies that present insanity this way , first from the point of view of the supposedly insane person , and eventually from the point of view of reality . In Dreams also did this really well . When John walks into the theater with his popcorn ( but no soda , how can you possibly eat popcorn and not have soda ? The guy's definitely insane ! ) and watches the movie that was made out of Cane's new book , he sees himself in the movie doing what we've seen him do throughout this movie , ' This is reality , ' ' I'm not insane , ' etc . Everything that he did that was a little nuts throughout the entire movie is edited together , and John sits there watching fascinated like a child and then slowly goes off into rolling laughter , and you just have to grin . Movies and books are supposed to get into your head , but only the best ones do . Sutter Cane obviously knew how to do it . I'm curious as to what Stephen King thought of this movie ?
In the world of the blind , the one-eyed man is king ?	This is spoken in Minority Report by a drug-dealer on the streets with no eyes at all , so I suppose its free advice for John Anderton , our hero , or a bit of wise-sounding advice meant to get across to the audience but with no other good place for it to fit in the film . This is fine with me , too , because Minority Report is such a taut futuristic thriller that an incongruous little bit of wisdom like this is not to have any negative impact on the film as a whole . John Anderton , played with precision by the great Tom Cruise ( oh shut up , the man's awesome ) , is the chief of the Pre-Crime department in the District of Columbia , which has successfully eradicated murder entirely for the last six years . He works with a group of ' pre-cogs ' that , together , dream of murders that have not yet taken place and project enough information for Anderton and his team to watch the video emanating from their heads to determine where and when the murders are to take place and to get to those locations and stop the murders from happening before they happen . This is obviously a formula for a highly successful action movie , but the thing that really makes Minority Report succeed is that it pays so much amount of attention to things that would occur in this situation in real life . It is explained very early in the film that the invention of Pre-Crime has eradicated premeditated murder , as this is most easily detected by the pre-cogs . The majority of the ' business , ' then , of the Pre-Crime division in the District of Columbia , are crimes of passion . This not only provides the possibility of a lot more tension in that these crimes leave a lot less time for prevention , but also avoids complicating the plot with the details of premeditated murders . We don't care about a guy who wronged another guy five years ago or drug deals gone bad , all we need to hear about are a guy who comes home to find his wife in bed with another man and loses control . Given the fact that the movie involves some sort of time-travel ( even if information is the only thing traveling through time ) , it leaves itself open to criticism about plot holes . This is obvious , because plot holes like this even permeated the unparalleled Back to the Future series , which obviously had plenty of plot holes but handled them spectacularly well . Given the amount of movies that I have seen that involve time travel , I have come up with this equation : Time Travel = Plot Holes . This is a universal equation that is never escaped , but it does not mean that any movie that involves time travel will be brought down by the subsequent and unavoidable plot holes . Minority Report did not suffer from its necessary plot holes and neither did the timeless Back to the Future series ( which has FINALLY been released as a complete set and which no respectable movie collection could possibly be without ) . My esteemed colleague and close friend Christopher Brown ( see his brilliant reviews at http us imdb com CommentsAuthor 625436 ) points out one of these plot holes in his review of Minority Report , but makes the mistake of suggesting that , given the nature of the precognition and of the crime itself , Anderton's murder should never have been predicted since it did not entail premeditation . Sorry , Chris , but you've missed the boat on this one . The only thing that this does is bring up the fact that it's impossible to tell where precognition starts . It could be argued perfectly well that the pre-cogs played a part in their own precognition . They predicted that Anderton would commit the murder under the circumstances that he would have been watching the thoughts of the pre-cogs and seen that he would commit murder , and then obviously sought to find out for himself how he could have been expected to commit a murder against a person he has never heard of . In this case , if he had called in sick that day , all of this would have been avoided . But he's the best at what he does , he has personal reasons for wanting to stop murder , he does not slack off , he does not call in sick . John Anderton was predicted by the pre-cogs to commit murder because he was at work that day . The action in the film comes from the possibility that the whole prediction of Anderton's murder might be what is called a ' minority report , ' where the pre-cogs disagree on something that is going to happen . If he can prove that only one of the pre-cogs came up with the vision that he was going to commit a murder , it might cancel out the entire prediction because it is unreliable . On the way to this goal , we are presented with everything from a tremendously dedicated investigator ( played brilliantly by Colin Farrell ) to some amazingly creepy but strangely accepted identification spiders that scan John's implanted eye in one of the more uncomfortable scenes in the film . Minority Report is one of the best and most unique thrillers to be released in years . It is the conglomeration of such a dizzying array of films that it is difficult to contemplate them all at once . We see elements of action films , futuristic thrillers , crime films , science fiction , and of course , the influence of Stanley Kubrick is never far off . There is even , especially in the later portion of the film , a heavy influence on the soundtrack by Bernard Herrman , who was the composer for most of Alfred Hitchcock's films , among many others . It's always nice to see such a respectful homage like that , and it is only one of the many things that makes Minority Report yet another addition to Steven Spielberg's extensive list of high-end films ( the last of which was the spectacular A . I . ) . The only thing I can think of that holds Minority Report back from joining Spielberg's list of timeless classics is that it does not have the scope as far as its target audience as such films as E . T . and Jurassic Park . However , despite not having quite as large of a target audience , Minority Report stands as a strong entry in Spielberg's growing list of great films .
" We're all just here trying to get some food . Sometimes we bump into each other . "	Having recently watched the amazingly disappointing Step Brothers with John C . Reilly and Will Farrell , I was not expecting much when I watched Reilly star alongside Seann William Scott in what looked to me like your standard rivalry comedy . But it's my job to watch movies so I was forced to sit through it , and I must say I was certainly pleasantly surprised . Scott is Doug Stauber , a regular guy with a regular job at a supermarket and he's looking to get a promotion to store manager . He sees a career and a simple but comfortable life with his young wife and their dream of a small home and a happy family . He's a good guy and he works hard , and we want him to get the job . The simplicity of his character is illustrated in a charming interaction with his wife , where she assures him that things will be okay , she can get a job and help them make money . Doug : " I wanna be the primary breadwinner , Jen . " Jen : " Female lions do the hunting ? " Doug : " I'm not a lion , I'm a guy ? " But then a Richard Wehlner , a charming Canadian transfer , arrives and they each realize that they are both seeking the same position . Richard has more experience than Richard and is probably more qualified for the job , and he also has his own wife and daughter and is also a great guy . Doug and Richard respect and even like each other , which makes their competition genuinely interesting . The movie centers on each man's inability to figure out how they are supposed to respond to and treat each other . They both want to be amiable and friendly , but they each realize that they have to destroy the other's hopes in order to achieve their own . The escalation of their competition and the gradual collapse of their formality is far more than I had expected from the movie , and the best way that the movie succeeds is that it makes us want to root for both of them . I noticed another user said on the IMDb that the movie was like an attempt to " pull a Jim Carrey or Will Farrell . " This person has missed the point of the movie so completely and so ridiculously that it's difficult for me to believe that he actually watched it . The Promotion is a smart movie starring two guys best known for doing not very smart comedy . All have made a step forward here and they should be recognized for it . Bravo !
Excellent Bond film . Possibly even better than the great From Russia With Love .	Never mind the fact that the opening song of Goldfinger rivals that of The Man With The Golden Gun as the worst theme song of the entire series , Goldfinger has one of the best and most interesting stories of all of the Bond films . Goldfinger , the villain , by the way , proves late in the film the HE is the man with the golden gun , not some cheesy actor in a mediocre action film made ten years later . It starts off with a better than average opening sequence , despite the fact that in it , Bond uses a woman to deflect an attack and also has the unlikely ability to see reflections of what's going on behind him in a woman's eye . The main story of the film concerns a man named Goldfinger who wants to contaminate the United States ' gold supply at Fort Knox to create economic chaos in the west and greatly increase the value of his own substantial gold supplies at the same time . It seems that because gold is relatively easy to melt down and remold , it is very easy to smuggle , and it is also the basis of the value of the dollar and pound . More than in either of the preceding two Bond films , we get what has come to be the traditional introduction by Q of all of Bond's new gadgets , most notably his heavily armed and beautiful new car , the Aston Martin DB-5 . Also , under new direction , Bond seems to be decidedly clumsier than usual . He messes up pretty good near the beginning of the film , and then later he messes up again because he does not know entirely what is going on . There was also a badly botched gunfight during the film that involved that car . Someone shoots at James with a machine gun in the car , and even though the windshield is covered all the way across with bullet holes , none of them seemed to have hit him . I can understand someone being a bad aim , but those bullets would have had to turn in mid-flight in order to miss him . Goldfinger calls his plan to detonate an atomic device inside Fort Knox , thereby rendering all of the gold radioactive for almost 60 years , Operation Grand Slam . The movie really starts to get good once this plan starts to get underway , with the exception of the ridiculous way that thousands of people dropped to the ground the second the planes flew overhead , spraying Goldfinger's poisonous gas . You'd think that it would at least take a few seconds for the gas to disperse through the air and get to the ground and into the peoples ' lungs before they started dropping like flies . It is a particularly eyebrow-raising moment when Goldfinger talks about all of the great human accomplishments - climbing Everest , reaching the bottom of the ocean , sending rockets to the moon ( not manned , of course . This IS only 1964 , after all ) ? he talks about all of these achievements ' in every area except crime ! ' Evidently , it is his goal to make his defacing of Fort Knox the major accomplishment in crime . Despite the obvious obsoleteness of most of the technology seen in the entire film , there is some true tension created by the skillfully paced climax , which is one of the main things that places Goldfinger high above most of the other Bond films . ( spoilers ) Another thing that was really impressive was the effectiveness of the laser beam that Goldfinger employed to kill Bond ( even though he decided not to kill him ) , while delivering some of the most famous dialogue in film history ? ' Do you expect me to talk ? ' ' No , I expect you to die ! ' This was especially noteworthy because it was the first laser beam ever used in a film . And speaking of which , the Austin Powers influence can hardly be ignored in this early Bond film . First of all , the above dialogue was hilariously borrowed by Dr . Evil , but it is the names of two of the more prevalent characters that is the most memorable thing in this film . Just as the name of Dr . Evil's cycloptic henchman , # 2 , was more than likely inspired by the goofy character # 3 in From Russia With Love , the names of two of his other sidekicks were obviously taken from Goldfinger . Obviously , any Bond film with a Bond girl named Pussy Galore is sure to be skewered by Mike Myers ' unique sense of humor , and sure enough , we get a character in Austin Powers named Alotta . Alotta Fagina . Another character whose named was parodied in exactly the same way was Dr . Evil's goofy sidekick Random Task , whose name is obviously a parody of Goldfinger's goofy sidekick , Odd Job . And how could Myers possibly avoid making fun of that idiotic hat trick ? There are many things that make Goldfinger a better than average Bond film , despite the fact that it obviously has many weaknesses . Sean Connery was just as great as he ever was before or since as the endlessly charming James Bond , even though this film , like every single other Bond film , was filled to capacity with dozens of idiotic one-liners that serve only to lower the standard of the film series as a whole . But in that sense , you can't really hold the one-liners against this film . On the contrary , maybe it should count in the film's favor that it was able to overcome the stupidity of the one-liners and still deliver an exciting and engaging action film . Now if only Pierce Brosnan would star in a Bond film that's worth watching ?
Bad-ass martial arts in zero gravity !	This is definitely a very unique film , but it clearly went a little too far in some elements . Is the martial art genre so done to death that the only thing left to do is come up with martial artists who are not subject to the laws of gravity ? The whole flying thing was just too much . But on the other , hand , Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon is still a great movie . There are some incredible fight scenes , in particular . This movie had women fighting with swords in scenes that were faster and more impressive than anything that I've ever seen from Jackie Chan or Jet Li . This was by far the best element of the film , by the way - the stunning fight scenes , particularly the ones that were executed while the fighters were on the ground as opposed to flying inexplicably through the atmosphere . Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon is a film that you really have to watch more than once in order to fully understand it , not only because of the complex plot , but also the fact that there is just so much going on that there is a lot that you can miss in only one viewing . Sure , it's subtitled , but is that really such a big deal ? A lot of people complain that they can't really watch the movie because they are always trying to read what's going on in the subtitles . Well , if it takes someone so long to read one line of dialogue at a time that they are unable to pay attention to what is actually happening on screen , then it might be a better idea to stay home and work on reading skills instead of going out to the movies . You can almost always be sure that a foreign film will be good , because foreign countries don't ship out their crappy movies for the world to see . The best ones are weeded out and those are what we get , and Crouching tiger , Hidden Dragon is no exception . ( spoilers ) The incredible martial arts strongly overshadow what would otherwise be the main plot of the film , which is that of a young woman , the daughter of a nobleman , who is being forced to marry against her will , and yearns for a more dangerous and exciting life . Having been sheltered for most of her life , she wants to experience the excitement of a different life , and when she enters into that life , she obviously finds many more problems and troubles than she had anticipated . She encounters a goofy guy who steals her comb ( providing for some good laughs ) , and a rather unlikely but surprisingly effective romance develops between the two . Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon contains a lot of fairly strong feminism . Women are portrayed as being very powerful and independent , which is a refreshing thing to see in the movies . There's nothing worse than seeing a movie where the female characters are just stupid bimbos . That may sound kind of extreme , but my point is that in Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon , the role of women stands out because the difference is so strong that it really grabs your attention . For some , the ending may have been a little too strange or too ambiguous , but it definitely has meaning . Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon is a beautifully photographed and very powerful film that should not be missed .
Oh shut up , you liked it .	EdTV undeservedly acquired a less than enviable reputation for no other reason that the fact that it followed so closely on the heels of The Truman Show , an entirely different movie that had a similar plot foundation . So needless to say , there will be plenty of cynical but superficial comparisons of the two films , but EdTV is more than able to stand on its own . The Truman Show was a drama with some comedic undertones , but mostly because it starred the endlessly amusing Jim Carrey , who is funny whether he is trying to be or not . EdTV , on the other hand , is a romantic comedy in which some regular guy gets his life put on TV because he won the contest that was held to decide who the lucky star would be . The reason that this seems to be so similar to The Truman Show is because both films concern regular people whose lives are broadcast on TV 24 hours a day , but The Truman Show is a bout a guy who doesn't know that his life is a TV show and eventually begins to catch on , while EdTV is about a guy who is given the opportunity to be broadcast on TV , and all of the problems that this causes him . Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson work excellently on screen as Ed , the guy who is put on TV , and Ray , his energetic brother , who WANTS his life to be put on TV . You get a unique love triangle between the two brothers and Shari , the object of both of their affection . Shari is actually one of the better characters in the film , because the viewing audience soon proves to not be very fond of Shari , and Jenna Elfman makes this very believable with her nerve gratingly aggravating performance . Interviews with the public showed that people were fed up with her whole attitude about the whole EdTV spectacle , and I found myself feeling the same way . Every time she was on screen complaining I just wanted her to get lost . It is McConaughey and Harrelson who really made the film work , with their excellent performances ( but what the hell was the deal with the chicken dance ? ) . The film also very effectively evoked some genuine emotion at several points , particularly in the scenes that dealt with Ed's and Ray's torn family life . There area also some very well known actors , particularly Dennis Hopper and Elizabeth Hurley , who show up in EdTV for some relatively small roles . If you still aren't convinced that this is a totally different movie than The Truman Show and that it is hugely entertaining , or if you have seen it already and dismiss it as an unimaginative rip-off of The Truman Show , put EdTV on and sit in the room , do something to occupy yourself , and try not to watch it . I guarantee you that you will sit there and watch the entire movie .
A lot better than you might expect .	The People vs . Larry Flynt is one of those movies that you just expect to be full of tasteless and unnecessary nudity , but that turns out to take itself a lot more serious than that and ends up being a lot more respectable in the end , kind of like Boogie Nights and not like the Howard Stern movie . Of course , Howard Stern's Private Parts is in a whole separate category from movies like Boogie Nights and The People vs . Larry Flynt . You can tell just from the title that the Howard Stern movie does not expect to be taken seriously . Howard wants to tell his story in the same 4th-grade humor way that he runs his radio show , but The People vs . Larry Flynt is a movie that wants to tell the story of Larry Flynt in a way that presents his life and his struggles with the religious and moral right in a much more serious way . Sure , he wears to court everything from diapers made of the American flag to t-shirts that say ' FCK THIS COURT , ' and does everything from spitting water everywhere to throwing oranges at the judge , but at the same time , the movie as a whole takes the story that it's telling very seriously , which is what makes this such a good film . Larry Flynt , as is one of the overall points of the entire film , is not what every American citizen would call an admirable man , but he is protected under the Constitution of the United States just as much as everyone else is . What we get in this film is the story of Flynt's struggle to prove that he has the right to say and do something that another person or group of people might not like or may find offensive . The film argues through the story of Larry Flynt against censorship and for the right to choose for ourselves . That is a fundamental right promised to Americans under the constitution , and Larry Flynt's profession tests the limits of that law . Besides being a look into the true workings and limits of the Constitution , the film presents a much more in-depth look into the life of Larry Flynt himself than just about anyone would otherwise have seen . This is a complex man that has had a rough life , and whether you agree with his lifestyle and his products or not , it sucks to realize that he's been through so much and is still seen by the American public in such a negative way . This man was shot by a sniper and confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life , and the only thing that most people think about him is that he's the biggest pervert in the country because he makes his living selling pornography . I have no sympathy for him being considered a pervert , because if I learned anything about him from this movie , it's that it doesn't bother him in the slightest to be considered a pervert , but no one should have to be stuck in a wheelchair . Just wondering my entire life who did it would be enough to drive me insane . It's not easy to make a good legal thriller . I wouldn't exactly call The People vs . Larry Flynt a legal thriller , but there is definitely a lot of thrilling legal content in the film . Edward Norton's role as Flynt's attorney , Alan Isaacman , doesn't even begin to compare to some of his later roles ( such as his towering performances in movies like American History X and Primal Fear ) , but he successfully captures the young attorney who has found himself involved with an out of control client who behaves like he's above the law throughout much of his legal proceedings . Courtney Love delivers a shockingly convincing performance as Althea Flynt , Larry's increasingly sickly wife , showing the world that she has some talent as an actor and is not just trying to make up for her lack of much talent as a musician . The People vs . Larry Flynt is not a curiosity piece just because it deals with such a powerful and famous pornographer , but is rather a fascinating biography of this man mixed with the presentation of his involvement with American laws and politics . As Flynt states in the film just before the final verdict is released , ' If the First Amendment will protect me , then it will protect all of you . Because I'm the worst . ' Maybe not the most eloquent or noble thing to say , but it's definitely true .
A fascinating journey .	I happened to borrow this movie from a friend knowing nothing about it , and it turned out to be an outstanding documentary about a journey on an ancient vessel across vast expanses of the ocean . Thor Heyerdahl had developed a theory that the ancient Incas in Peru managed to travel thousands of miles across the ocean to Polynesia , based on certain relics that are found in both places , certain types of ancient sea-going vessels that we know they had available , analysis of ocean and wind currents , and the knowledge that the Incas did , in fact , travel in some undetermined amount at sea . In order to test his hypothesis , Heyerdahl and his crew construct a vessel as closely as possible to what the ancient Incas had available , using only balsa wood and other materials available at the time , and set out from Lima , Peru's capital , to try to reach the islands of Polynesia , some 5 , 000 miles away . His theory , like so much about ancient history , is impossible to prove with 100 % certainty , but the coverage of their journey provides for strong support that he is right . The film is really little more than narration of footage taken during the 100 + day expedition , but it is a very detailed description of what it was like and the trials and tribulations that they faced . I often wish that Academy Award winning documentaries were easier to find , and this one from more than 50 years ago is still as interesting and informative as I am sure it was when it was first released .
How did Wes Craven go from this to the Nightmare on Elm Street comedies ? ?	I watched The Last House on the Left having only recently gone back and watched The Texas Chainsaw Massacre again and learning that I simply don't enjoy abrasive horror films like that . They are extremely well-made and very effective , but they are effective to the point that I don't find them all that fun to watch , the way I enjoy watching even the campiest scary movies . I also realized that there is a much more distinct line between horror movies and scary movies than I had previously realized . Horror movies , like Texas Chainsaw and Last House on the Left , are not scary , they're horrible . Conversely , scary movies hopefully are actually scary ( although all too often they're not either ) , but are rarely horrible , mostly because excesses of gore and whatnot often render them campy , separating them from reality and allowing you to laugh while someone is being brutally killed . Last House on the Left is a horror movie , not a scary movie . It is not scary for a second , but the fact that it is presented in this almost documentary-like way and involves very realistic characters make it that much more effective . Given that I was so recently sickened once again by Texas Chainsaw , I was expecting something equally abrasive from Last House on the Left , which I decided to see after seeing an excellent documentary about horror film history called The American Nightmare . The movie was clearly a groundbreaking film at the time of its release , and you can clearly see throughout the film scenes that were influential to popular horror films that have come out over the years . I was reminded of some cheesy backwoods movies that also came out in the 1970s , like ' Gator Bait and the disturbing I Spit on Your Grave , which both have a similar feel to Last House on the Left , but oddly do not have nearly the effect of novice director Wes Craven's early film . I have a feeling that this may be because Craven had significantly less goofy caricatures in his movie than either of the ' Gator Bait films or I Spit on Your Grave , both of which are hugely overshadowed by Last House on the Left , which in turn was eclipsed by the classic Deliverance the same year . In watching the interviews with Wes Craven and producer Sean Cunningham on the DVD , it is clear that the movie turned out to be a lot more than they had expected it to , mostly because it was so disturbing that there were people who didn't want either of them to ever be allowed to work in film again , and it's not hard to see why they were so upset . More than 30 years later , the film remains effectively disturbing and upsetting , simply because it portrays real people doing horrible things to other real people . There are simple situations in the movie where you may find yourself wide-eyed with shock at something that could easily be created by a few people with a home video camera . The success with which Craven and Cunningham were able to make such an effective film with little to no budget ranks Last House on the Left with other low budget classics like Texas Chainsaw and Night of the Living Dead , although it now retains considerably less notoriety , possibly because of the lack of a whole line of sequels . I have to say that I really enjoyed the police officers in the movie , a sheriff and his deputy whose jaw-dropping stupidity surpasses even that of all of the law enforcement in First Blood . The campy gestures like the sheriff slapping his forehead and rubbing his chin helplessly at his inability to commandeer a chicken farmer's truck when their own car ran out of gas , gosh darn it . The comic relief is unusually starkly contrast with the rest of the movie , but it's a good thing it's there , otherwise the movie would be even more difficult to watch . While it's true that it is an uncomfortable experience watching the movie and I've recently decided I don't enjoy things like that , you have to respect the skill with which it was put together . Not just the level of depravity that Craven and Cunningham managed to reach , but the way they were able to come up with ways to put the film together when they had such limited resources . From a technical standpoint , the movie is a huge success because of that . Not quite as much fun as some of his later movies ( and not quite as bad as some of his later movies ) , but Last House on the Left performs some things that remain almost unheard of in the movies , especially horror movies , such as the fact that it contains full frontal nudity and extensive and brutal violence , but glorifies neither . The simple fact that this movie can be as graphic as it is without being exploitative is enough to show that even after three decades there is still something to be learned from it .
Excellent story of a junkie who tries to straighten out his life , only to find out that things aren't much better than they were before .	Matt Dillon delivers one of the best performances of his career in Drugstore Cowboy , a gritty film about the real life of junkies . There is heavy drug content in this film , but in no way is the drug life glorified . We see the more realistic life of drugs on the streets , which is probably what makes this such an aesthetically unpleasing film . No one in the movie looks good , it has just about as much ugliness as a spectacularly ugly movie like Buffalo ' 66 , which enhances the realism of the film . Much of the film is shot in a documentary style , giving it a gritty , realistic feel , almost like a twisted home movie . Dillon plays the part of Bob , a young junkie in the early 1970s who goes around with his group of friends breaking into pharmacies and drug stores and stealing random bottles of prescription bottles looking for their next high . The movie starts at the end of the story , with Bob riding in an ambulance and telling us the story of how he got there , but has the pleasing distinction of not leading you exactly to where you knew you were going to be . Even by showing the end of the story there is nothing given away . This is a powerful drug film that doesn't hold anything back . It is not pretty to look at , but also like Buffalo ' 66 , it's hideously unattractive counterpart , the movie has something to say .
Definitely one of the best thrillers of all time .	I'm normally not one to spend much time concerning myself with who won what Oscar and who didn't win that Oscar , but if anyone but Anthony Hopkins had been awarded the Best Actor Oscar in 1991 I would have been bitterly disappointed . In my opinion , Hopkins ' performance as the deceptively charming Hannibal Lecter is one of the best performances ever caught on film . Especially if you have read the novel by Thomas Harris , Hopkins flawlessly captures all sides of the tremendously complex personality of Hannibal Lecter , providing for one of the main things that made The Silence of the Lambs such a spectacular film . ( possible spoilers ahead ) Another person who performed amazingly well was Ted Levine as the horribly disturbed murderer Jame Gumb . Levine presents a startlingly convincing portrayal of the disgustingness of this character , as well as his psychological isolation from the normal world and other people in general , shown with great effectiveness through the way that he talks to his victims ( ' It rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again . ' ) . Jame Gumb ( whose first name , Jamie , had been misspelled on his birth certificate , but he insisted on leaving it that way ) is the man that the FBI is utilizing Lecter's tremendous intelligence to try to capture . Gumb kidnaps full figured women and cuts portions of their skins off , which he sews together in order to make himself a full body human skin suit . One of the amazing things about this film is that it was able to win a Best Picture Oscar while having such a gory premise , and this obviously has something to do with the tremendous quality of the movie . It was so good because there were so many things going on in the film . I guess you could say the plot was extremely thick . Clarice Starling , played excellently by Jodie Foster , is an FBI trainee who is assigned the emotionally and psychologically dangerous task of trying to get Lecter to talk to her , because he sees right through all of the questionnaires and surveys given to him by countless other , more experienced , personnel . Beyond that , Starling is also fighting her own personal demons ; she's struggling through her training , she has to ward off the amorous advances of at least one of her superiors , and now she is faced with an assignment that dwarfs all of those problems . Then you have the story with Jame Gumb , and on the other side , you have the struggle of dozens of people trying to control Lecter and get him to talk without damaging anyone emotionally or psychologically ( evidently he was able to talk the insane inmate in the cell next to his into swallowing his tongue one night ) . You also have a very detailed subplot about the types of insects that are found on the bodies of Gumb's victims . And , of course , you have Lecter's stunning insights , providing in one very tense scene , the meaning of the title , The Silence of the Lambs . Clearly , Thomas Harris deserves a lot of credit for his outstanding novel , but so do the filmmakers for their efforts at crafting this first rate thriller . This is not exploitative cinema in any way , and it is extremely unique in both its story as well as its presentation . Some scenes really stood out in their originality , particularly Dr . Lecter's escape , although it is never clearly explained how Lecter , while in restraints , was able to get a hold of Dr . Chilton's ballpoint pen , which he had been eyeing as it lay on the desk and which he eventually used to open his handcuffs . Luckily , the quality of the film as a whole overshadows trivial things like this , making them more than excusable . This is a very graphic film , make no mistake about that , but it is so well done that it can be enjoyed by virtually anyone .
Another brilliant performance from the greatest stand-up comedian of all time .	I was able to see a performance by Gallagher at his nearly catastrophic show in Sacramento on February 8th , 2003 , and I would just like to say that Gallagher has gotten the Sledge-O-Matic down to an art . Watching these old videos really shows me how much better he has gotten at it over the years . He had a whole array of different things to smash at his show that I went to this month , and the splatter flew further than I've ever seen it go in his older videos . One of the few things that I didn't like about Gallagher : Over Your Head was the way he threw a couple of things over his shoulder rather than smashed them . Granted , I think he only did this with a couple of items ( a cantaloupe and a pineapple , if I remember correctly ) , but I just didn't see why he would do that instead of smashing them . That's what people want to see ! This show was also slowed down a little bit by The River Poem , which is certainly something that makes a great comment about the environment and shows how concerned Gallagher is with it , but I was a little put off by it simply because the comedy in the rest of the show was so side-splitting that I didn't want him to take a break from it . There was also a tap-dance routine that didn't fit too well with the rest of the show , and which was followed by Gallagher having a guest on stage to hand him items to smash with the Sledge-O-Matic , and I just prefer to see him do it all himself . I guess I've been spoiled a little by Gallagher : The Maddest , inarguably his best video ever , but even with small shortcomings like these , Gallagher : Over Your Head is another great dose of the brilliant comedy that he always delivers .
Astounding .	I studied marine biology for a couple years in college , and this movie has some of the most amazing underwater footage I've ever seen . It's a fascinating journey into the ocean , particularly the parts that most of us will never see , like the arctic regions and the deepest reaches of the deep ocean . Some of the shots themselves are incredible just in the way the camera crew were able to immerse themselves in the biological communities that they were filming , especially the feeding scenes . Anyone with even a passing interest in the ocean and the mysteries of life on this planet should definitely not miss this . This movie is an explanation for why so many people believe that our planet should be called Oceanus rather than Earth .
Carol Reed molds a great mystery that unfolds more and more throughout the course of the film . Wonderfully photographed , acted , written , and directed .	Orson Welles is excellent as Harry Lime , a man who invites his friend Holly Martins to visit him in Vienna from his home in the United States . When Holly arrives , he learns that Harry has been killed in a car accident . When he tries to find out more about the accident that killed his friend , Holly encounters surprisingly strong opposition . The Third Man is put together amazingly well and contains some truly amazing cinematography , including several scenes on the war-torn streets of Vienna . Maybe the most unusual quality of this film is the fact that it is pulled along mostly by the quality of the story , rather than star actors or special effects ( which were , of course , much less common in 1949 than they are today ) . The story is so complex and well-told that it almost overshadows even such stars ( in true " star roles " ) as Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten . The Third Man is a classic post-war film . It is amazingly well done , and should not be missed .
Mumbai Teen Amazed to Discover Corrupt TV Show .	There are two completely different story-lines taking place in Slumdog Millionaire , and they take place simultaneously and involve mostly all of the same people . Director Danny Boyle Has woven the stories together with such precision , such seamless skill that it presents an almost impossibly clear picture of this kid's life up to the point where he is a contestant on the Indian version of " Who Wants To Be A Millionaire . " Jamal Malik grew up in a Mumbai slum and has lived a life of of devastating poverty and drastic heartbreak . As a child , he and his brother Salim formed a close friendship with a young girl named Latika , but the happy times they had together ended with a tragic separation that continued for many years . As an 18-year-old young man , Jamal found his way onto the Millionaire program , and a chaotic reunion with his brother and Latika ensued . The sequence of events that led to Jamal's participation on the program and the reasons that he sought to be a contestant in the first place are major plot points that I don't want to reveal , but it seems a little unnecessary to do that anyway . t's nearly impossible to do justice to a movie like this by explaining plot points , so suffice it to say that Slumdog Millionaire is the intricate work of a master director at the top of his form . He has created a story of ordinary people living in terrible poverty and extraordinary situations . There are no caricatures in the movie , every character is developed with such clarity that it's almost impossible to determine who the good guys and bad guys are because we understand how every character has come to be the person that he or she is . The movie is told in a wildly unchronological order . The timelines are so mixed and blended that it is a spectacular feat in itself that Boyle has managed to craft such a compelling story and that it never becomes confusing . Many people were confused by Christopher Nolan's brilliant film Memento for much the same reason , and while I can't understand much criticism of that movie , I don't think Slumdog Millionaire will receive many of those kinds of complaints . Jumps back and forth in time and from one simultaneous story to another with such ease that it all feels completely natural . It has been said that Danny Boyle has reinvented the crowdpleaser with Slumdog Millionaire , which is a pretty apt statement . It never once panders to anyone , it never compromises its integrity with weak , sugary plot developments , it doesn't even appear to have any influence whatsoever of the Hollywood machine . There is terrific payoff at various times , intertwined with heartbreaking disappointment and struggles . But probably best of all , it provides astonishing insight into the lives of the Indian people . Jamal's young life took place in an slum of such complete destitution that the people almost seemed not to realize it was happening . The people are filthy poor , but its all they've ever known , and the way the kids play with such glee , it makes us understand that they don't view their lifestyle with the same understanding audience that those of us on the outside would . For the full effect , Boyle juxtaposes this level of existence with the polished world of a successful television show , hosted by a man who is so incapable of accepting that a kid who came from this background could possibly know the answers to his questions . In fact , possibly the film's only real weakness , the thing that will be difficult for us to believe , is that every question asked by the show happens to coincide with remarkable accuracy to some traumatic incident in Jamal's life . But that is a good part of the movie's message , as well . About 70 % of India's population , which I believe is nearly 1 . 2 billion people , live in small , poor villages , probably not terribly unlike the one where Jamal and Samir and Latika grew up . Slumdog Millionaire is the story of one kid from one of those villages for whom , after a childhood of unbroken poverty and beggary , all of the stars finally aligned .
In my past life , I was a fat btard !	SPOILERS SPOILERS Shrek sure did exceed the expectations . I was expecting some immature comedy that vainly tried to re-capture the stunning success of Toy Story , but it was much more than that . The computer animation is breath taking , I would even say that it is better than Toy Story's , at least in some elements . The humans ' faces , for example , was something that Toy Story never got quite right , but they look great here . The animals are amazingly realistic , too . They even managed to make a female dragon look sexy ! Now THAT'S an accomplishment in animation science ! ( spoilers ) There are a lot of themes presented in Shrek , the most prevalent of which is that of being yourself , loving yourself for who you are , and there's probably a bit of the old one about there being someone out there for everyone ( Hey , if SHREK can find true love . ) . Sure , these are all clichés ( and , technically , therefore can't officially be themes , I guess , but who's grading this ? No one ! ) , but they are presented in a hilarious and entertaining way , if not exactly original or even entirely inventive . The plot is fairly simple , a bunch of fairy tale creatures are being banished by a prince for some reason , and they all wind up on the swamp property of Shrek , a fearful ogre who lives in the woods and feels too ugly to have contact with any other beings ( much like Frankenstein's poor monster ) . Shrek goes to the prince to get the fairy tale creatures off of his land , who agrees as long as Shrek will travel to a far away kingdom and rescue a princess and bring her back so the prince can marry her . That's about the size of it , but what an adventure ! There is also the excellent addition of a talking donkey ( who is voiced by Eddie Murphy but looks like Chris Rock ) who is Shrek's sidekick and friend throughout the movie . The fairy tale creatures are some of the best parts of the movie , there's something here from EVERYONE'S childhood . We see everything from the talking gingerbread man ( ' Do you know the muffin man . ? ' ) to Snow White and the Seven Dwarves to the talking string puppet who thinks he's a real boy . This is great stuff ! There is even a great scene where they parodied ( to spectacular effect ) some of the shots from The Matrix , and this turns out to be one of the best scenes in the film . You almost want to get up and cheer at the way the princess kicks the asses of all of Robin Hood's men ( how's THAT for irony ! ) . Shrek and the donkey are stunned into hilarious silence . The only scene that didn't seem to have a lot of thought put into it was where the princess is talking to the donkey after having turned into the hideous beast that she transforms into after sunset every night , and she is afraid of what Shrek will think if he finds out that she turns ugly every night . Has she not seen Shrek ? He's an ogre ! He's the loneliest ogre in the world , and she's worried because she turns into one of his species every night . Come on , princess , wake up and smell the pheromones ! You'd think it would be obvious to her that he would be thrilled to learn of her nightly transformation . There is definitely no shortage of hilarious puns regarding the short stature of the prince . Besides that , James Bond could definitely take some serious knowledge from the effectiveness of the one-liners that seem to appear in Mike Meyers ' movies ( remember the succession of hilarious one liners in the head scene in Austin Powers ? ) . I'm still not sure why it was so funny that the prince was such a little squirt , but there seemed to be no end to the laughs . However , the most effective and memorable element of the film is the romance that develops between the princess and Shrek . This romance would be obviously manipulative of the audience and therefore insulting if she had just fallen in love with her rescuer despite his abhorrent appearance , but her nightly transformations make the pair work very well . After Shrek has made it to hers and the prince's wedding just in time to stop her form marrying him , we are entreated to a charming scene ( which includes the donkey riding the dragon and hilariously threatening the crowd with it as though it were a weapon - ' I've got a dragon and I'm not afraid to use it ! ' ) which ends with the princess revealing her condition to Shrek for the first time . As she kisses Shrek , her true love , she lifts into the air , and the spell is lifted from her , as previously explained . I remember sitting there and thinking that the movie was about to be ruined because she would turn into a beautiful princess and Shrek would suddenly become her charming prince , and it was such a relief that this didn't happen ! If they had both turned into beautiful people , the message of the entire film would have been cancelled out , and we would be left with the feeling that poor Shrek could never find true love if he were an ugly ogre , and that no one can truly be happy unless they are beautiful humans . That would have really pied me off . She asks Shrek if he'll love her even if she's not beautiful , and he says , ' You are beautiful . ' There is no way that this movie could have had a more uplifting and satisfactory ending than that , unless of course , it closed with the donkey and all of the fairy tale creatures singing ' I'm a believer ' in an excellent outdoor concert . This is a truly memorable film . It's got its share of childishness , but there can be no mistake about its quality . There is something here for everyone , and the message that it delivers is important in the society that we live in , which is disturbingly concerned with superficiality ( hence the quality and success of American Beauty ) . Bring the kids , the parents , the grandparents , everyone .
Incredible trip back .	Having recently seen Romero's new Land of the Dead I decided to go back and check out some of the extra features included on the massive Ultimate DVD collection of Dawn of the Dead , which I didn't like . I remember being amazed at the sickness of Dawn of the Dead , which I consider to be by far the goriest of the trilogy . I remember being hugely unimpressed by the 1978 version of Dawn of the Dead ( and surprisingly impressed by the 2004 remake ) , so it was great to see the cast and crew talking about making the movie in this wonderful documentary . One of my favorite individual moments in this documentary was when Tom Savini talked about how he had planned to put make-up on all of the zombies to make them look gray but that it turned out to be a bad idea because they came out so many different colors ? green , blue , etc , and just didn't look right . This was , if I remember correctly , one of the things that most bothered me about the 1978 Dawn because , being the first film in the trilogy to be filmed in color , the ineffective make-up was a big problem for me . For a movie that was made nearly three decades ago , I was really surprised at how much detail they were able to get into this documentary , as well as how many of the original cast , many of them almost obscure zombies from the film , they were able to get together for interviews to talk about their experiences in making the movie . It was great to see how the town of Pittsburgh really came together to help make the movie , having been so impressed by the original film , and how much of a fun fiasco the making of the movie was for so many of the extras and for the cast . This entire DVD collection is a wonderful compilation of information about the making of the movie and the movie itself , and even if you didn't love the film itself , as I didn't , this is definitely something to check out . I have often noticed that documentaries and other supplemental materials included with DVDs can vastly improve your opinion of a movie , and this one is no exception . Don't miss this one .
Historic action / crime thriller . A must-see for all film buffs .	The Great Train Robbery was filmed only a couple of years into the 20th century , and when you watch it , its age is quite obvious . However , when you watch movies like this , you need to transport yourself back to the time period in which it was created and kind of watch the film through eyes that haven't been subjected to spectacularly visual films like The Matrix or Terminator 2 . Edwin Porter made a ground-breaking film with The Great Train Robbery . Sure , the scenes were very simple and the film is so blurry that you can't make out a single face ( this is also a result of the total lack of close-up shots ) , but in 1903 people watched this film and were stunned . It was hugely successful because it was one of the first films in the world to be made that actually told a story . Previously , films were made mainly to show off the technology of the " moving picture , " and the public loved them because they had never seen such a thing before . But when Porter came along with The Great Train Robbery , the path of motion pictures changed dramatically because people began to realize that these films could tell stories just as well as they could show water lapping on the beach or factory workers getting off of work or people jumping into a lake . These were the type of films that were made in the 1890s and early 1900s . The Great Train Robbery is an extremely short film , but it is an interesting story that is made even more fascinating because of the fact that everything that happens on the screen happened nearly 100 years ago . It's like looking at a piece of history .
Edward Norton delivers a staggering performance as an extremely intelligent white supremacist who realizes the wrongness of his views and must then try to prevent his younger brother form going down the same	American History X is one of the most powerful movies released in years . Not since Schindler's List has the subject of racism been so potently presented . The use of black and white cinematography to portray painful flashbacks is amazing , and the settings , while not necessarily pretty , fit the story flawlessly . Derek Vineyard's ( Edward Norton ) transition from a white supremacy leader's protege to a gang leader himself to a changed man is shown mainly through a series of flashbacks to the time before he was sent to prison . The character development and story are amazingly well done , and this is largely a factor of the high quality of the acting . Edward Norton especially , but also Edward Furlong , Beverly D'Angelo , and all of the rest of the cast down to Avery Brooks as Bob Sweeney , the African American high school teacher who comes up with the term American History X , and Stacy Keach as the wonderfully hateable Cameron Alexander . Keach , by the way , would have been the perfect choice to play Francis Dolarhyde in Manhunter , the film the precedes The Silence of the Lambs , but oh well . Unfortunately , despite the fact that American History X is one of the best films in years , it is horribly underrated . Much like Norton's last film , Primal Fear , which was also a great movie , this movie did not get nearly the recognition that it deserves .
Another example of an excellent but largely misunderstood movie .	American Beauty is another one of those movies that everyone seems to vote for as the Best Picture of the last ten years or so that did not deserve a Best Picture Oscar ( yeah , you've seen the polls ? ) . This is a perfect example of a widespread misunderstanding of the quality of the film . American Beauty is not a satire of the typical American family , as I've often heard it called . Nor is it a childish comedy on the level with Road Trip or American Pie , as I've also been shocked to hear it compared to . It is a film about America's obsession with superficial beauty and , perhaps even more , the complications and problems that come as a result of trying too hard to conform to the norms of modern society ? associating happiness with financial success and whatnot . Lester Burnham ( Kevin Spacey ) is one of these people who has gotten the supposed cushy office job , he lives in a nice house in a nice neighborhood , has a beautiful and wealthy wife , and appears to be an all-around successful man . When we see closer into his life , however , we see that even though everything looks stable from the outside , his entire life is meaningless and falling apart . His wife does not respect him , she cheats on him , and their sex life is non-existent , his daughter is embarrassed by him , he realizes that he has a pointless job at which he is wasting his life away , and he knows that if he doesn't do something about all of this , he'll die with a healthy bank account and an empty soul . Lester decides to throw away all of the meaningless crap that he has accumulated in his life and have fun . He quits his office job , which he hates , and gets a job at a fast food restaurant , which he surprisingly enjoys , he smokes pot with the neighbor's son , and he fantasizes about his daughter's friend , curiously named Angela . Is any of this wrong ? Clearly , there is some debate about whether or not a 40-year-old man can , in good conscience , fantasize about a high school girl , more than any other of the questionable occurrences in the film . Personally , I think that this moral diversion comes as a result of his poor choices earlier in life which led to his current unhappiness and deviating thoughts . This is just another point that the movie is trying to get across . This is a guy who tried for his whole life to be socially and financially accepted , and look at how miserable and pathetic he is . You can complain all you want about this curious relationship , but keep in mind that at the end of the film , he gets a grip on himself and realizes what he is doing . Clearly , the film revolves around Lester's struggles with himself and his life , but there are several other characters that are not as central but also play significant roles in the film . Lester's neighbor is an ex-marine experiencing anger management problems and difficulty with his sexual orientation , and this man's son Ricky is a strangely observant kid who lives in a difficult household but maintains a clear view of the important thingsin life . Lester's daughter can't stand her family and is struggling with an attraction to Ricky that she initially doesn't understand and doesn't particularly like , and her friend Angela is the blonde cheerleader type who wants nothing more than to be accepted and respected , and she seeks these things through her huge efforts to be sexually attractive . This is a complicated character structure , and it is topped off by the striking character development that takes place in every single character in the movie by the end , and this is really one of the film's strongest points . In American Beauty , we don't see the life of a person as it is changed and affected by the world around him or her , we see the lives of a whole group of people as they interact with each other and change while following the rules set for them by the society that they grew up in . This makes the film much more effective and the message much clearer . ( spoilers ) Clearly , this is something of a worst-case scenario , but nothing in the film is impossible . Everyone ( at least those of us in America , I suppose ) is capable of following the rules of society too closely and ending up miserable like Lester Burnham and his family and friends and neighbors , so watch out . Even Lester's terrible ending is not necessarily tragic . He knew when he quit his job and started working at a fast food restaurant , along with all of his other seemingly reckless behaviors , that he was endangering his future , but he was enjoying himself . He was feeling better than he had in years and years , and that mattered - as it should to all of us , to an extent - more than anything else . The only person left unhappy was the neighbor , who killed Lester because he still doesn't understand himself and is ashamed about something that he has discovered . Each character in the film represents a different lesson that can be learned by everyone . They're not all working together to deliver one big message , they're all giving something of their own , adding to the richness and superiority of the film as a whole . Make no mistake , all you poll voters , American Beauty WAS the Best Picture of 1999 .
Look man , I'm a huge Bill Murray fan . I really am . The guy's hilarious . But I liked Simon & Garfunkel's version better .	While it may at first seem that this is a careless documentary that was thrown together quickly because of its unpolished feel and lack of sit-down interviews , that is one of the things that I liked the most about it . As the title implies , this is an on location documentary , it's a look behind the scenes , not a documentary about the making of Lost in Translation , although you get some of that , too . Whenever I watch these supplemental features that sometimes accompany movies on their DVDs , I am always mindful of the title of the documentaries because I think the title should be indicative of what is in the documentary itself , and in this case the title promises exactly what is delivered . Take , for example , the documentary that accompanies the science fiction classic The Day The Earth Stood Still , which is called " Making the Earth Stand Still and yet has absolutely nothing to do with how the movie was made . It was a mediocre documentary at best even without considering the unsuitable title , especially considering that it was made for the DVD release of such a landmark film , so I was glad to see that what might even be called a crudely made documentary offered exactly what you expect , giving wonderful insight into the experiences that the cast and crew had on location in Tokyo making Lost in Translation . This is what behind the scenes really means , it is someone running around during filming and production with a video camera , shooting basic footage of what goes on during the making of the movie and getting various , impromptu interviews with cast and crew about what they are doing that day and their thoughts about the filming process . It's unscripted , unpolished , and rough , but it's real . And that's what I like . There's a great scene where they all go to an upstairs Starbucks in downtown Tokyo and pretend that they're ordering lattes so they can get a point of view shot from the window . That's the kind of tricks you have to pull to get a relatively low budget film made on a location like that , and I found it very interesting that that was how they captured a lot of their on location footage . There is another good shot of a sequence that is filmed in the subway , with Scarlet Johnassen getting on a real subway in a real subway station with real people going to or from work . This is a very difficult way to film , especially as far as getting people not to look at the camera . Another of the interesting problems that they ran into was a typhoon , which was reportedly the biggest typhoon to hit Japan since World War II , and it was on course to go right through the heart of Tokyo right in the middle of production . The encounter was so close that they were concerned about people being able to get back to their hotels after the day's shooting was finished . I just finished reading Sidney Lumet's wonderful book " Making Movies , " and he talks about all kinds of things like this happening during the filming of some of his movies . Whenever I watch these documentaries I always try to learn something not just about how a specific movie was made , but about film-making in general , and this one is a nuts and bolts tour of at least some parts of the film-making process . There is also a hilarious scene with Bill Murray practicing his Japanese with a book called Making Out in Japanese ( pun intended ? ) , where he calls various crew members over to the table where he is giving his interview , asks them a question , and when they respond he says to them " Who do you think you're talking to ? " in Japanese . You know this guy is just a blast to work with , and it's even funnier when he says it to crew members who can understand what he's saying . I think that one of the things that I really liked about this documentary was the way that it was made , with just some video footage taken on set very simply but effectively edited together , especially because it is something that I could very easily have made myself , and have made similar documentaries before . This entire thing could have been made on the very computer on which I am writing this review . Besides that , I have some good friends who have been getting very involved with drift racing and I'm the official videographer . Recently they were invited to participate in what is called a Touge Showdown , in which two of the best drivers from Japan come to America to race four or five cars against each other and then rate them , so I've been editing a lot of Japanese footage . Not that that matters , but the video that I made was a lot like this , because it was me running around with one of my video cameras shooting the making of the very professional videos that they make for broadcast in Japan . I had one camera , these guys had about 90 , each probably worth as much as my car . It does not come out looking like a Hollywood film , but I really think that this is the most realistic and effective way to look behind the scenes of a movie .
Excellent legal drama ?	In The Insider , Russell Crowe once again proves his versatility as an actor . It's amazing how different he looks in this film from his other roles , particularly Mystery , Alaska and Gladiator . Here , he plays the part of Jeffrey Wigand , a man who is torn between his responsibility to uphold his agreement to keep his mouth shut about happenings with a gigantic tobacco company and his duty to inform the public of potentially harmful products . He was fired from his position as the head of research and development , and as he gingerly begins to speak to Lowell Bergman ( Al Pacino ) , a spokesman from 60 Minutes , he begins receiving death threats aimed at himself and his family . Crowe delivers yet another outstanding performance , as does Al Pacino , who flawlessly creates the type of character that his role calls for . Not only is this a very interesting story , but it also gives a very good look at how big business corporations work , with both the massive cigarette companies as well as the respected television show , 60 Minutes , being presented in a new light . The casting was perfect for this film , everyone delivered excellent performances . The legal thriller is an almost endlessly interesting genre , but The Insider puts a new twist on the almost overdone subject , resulting in an excellent film that should not be missed .
Even the MPAA ratings board loved it ?	I bring up the ratings board because , like the two films that followed it , Raiders of the Lost Ark seems to have been granted almost unprecedented leniency in the rating . People get shot , stabbed , poisoned , murdered , blended up by airplane propellers , a head explodes , another head has the skin melted off of it like candle wax , there are corpses and all manner of other horrible things , and yet the movie gets a PG rating . I watched Raiders of the Lost Ark , The Temple of Doom and The Last Crusade one after the other yesterday , and early on found myself wondering what it was about The Last Crusade that earned it a PG-13 rating when both movies before it were shockingly violent and bloody for PG films . Our introduction to Indiana Jones is much like most of the time that we spend with him , a nonstop roller coaster ride of adventure , where one thrilling situation leads right into the next . He is sort of what every kid fantasizes that adult life is really like , a constant adventure punctuated only by the times when he has to teach class , pretending to be a normal working adult and hiding the fact that he's a world-traveler who constantly risks life and limb in order to get precious artifacts into museums where they belong . This is the kind of thing that makes you want to be an archaeologist . The movies all take us to exotic locations and immerse us completely in thrilling adventure , as Jones gets himself into one dangerous situation after another in search of ancient historical artifacts . It's surprising that it wasn't until the third film that he goes after the Holy Grail , but each film starts off with scenes of adventure that rival even the best opening action sequences from any of the James Bond films . The Ark of the Covenant represents everything that Jones got into archeology for in the first place , as he mentions early in the film , and he has to race against time in order to obtain it before it falls into the hands of the Nazis . The film displays exactly the right amount of comic relief to counteract the viciousness of Jones ' pursuers who , as we know , are not above torturing and killing in order to get what they want . The characters in the movie are wonderful , with Karen Allen portraying Marion Ravenwood , Jones ' ex-girlfriend who ends up his partner on his quest for the Ark and , my favorite , John Rhys-Davies as another helper along the way . Some of the best scenes in the movie involve Rhys-Davies when they're all in the desert , at the site in which the Ark supposedly rests . Speaking of the best scenes , some of them are not the ones that take place when Jones first arrives in Nepal . The fight scenes that take place when he and Marion get separated in the marketplace are heavily over-rehearsed and completely unconvincing , but I'm still willing to accept them because the scene as a whole is so much fun . The scene where Jones casually shoots the swordsman in front of the crowd has been one of my favorite scenes in the movie since I was a kid , although when I watched it yesterday I noticed that every single extra in the scene reacts wrongly except for a single person . One person immediately turns and runs terrified into the crowd away from the shooting , while everyone else throws their hands into the air and dances around as though they're celebrating . I hope someone found that one extra and offered sufficient congratulations . The movie is set against the backdrop of Nazi Germany under the control of Hitler , who wants the Ark recovered for himself at all costs , so it's Indiana Jones and his two partners trying to recover the Ark and survive the onslaught of all of Germany's military might . The movie is put together in the same manner as the old Saturday adventure serials , this time with bigger adventure and more danger . ( spoilers for all three films ahead ! ) What I especially respect about the movies is that they avoid going too far . It's a difficult line that they walk , too , because you can't have a movie like this that delves too deep into the meaning and existence of a lot of the things that Jones searches for without risking failure . Many adventure films seek certain things that , if they are shown , will immediately look fake ( like the aliens in Mission to Mars ) , and if they're not shown they risk failure by giving the feeling of leading the audience on without payoff at the end . All three ( thus far ) Indiana Jones films ultimately end up with Jones ' failure to obtain the artifacts that he is seeking , but he has still been successful in his missions . It's not an easy thing to accomplish in any story , but these movies are more concerned with the thrill of the chase and the knowledge of when success has truly been achieved rather than getting too close to the objects at hand . Bravo .
" Peace is Our Profession . "	Dr . Strangelove is widely considered to be one of Stanley Kubrick's best films , if not THE best , and it's easy to see why . I remember watching it several years ago and not really getting into it , but as I rewatched it a couple nights ago I realized quickly what I had missed back then . It is a remarkably simple film , an actor's film , obviously , but the crackling dialogue and the stunning performances ( most notably from Peter Sellers and George C . Scott , of course ) , are what really make the movie work so well . That is , of course , a pretty powerful statement , to give so much credit to the actors , since the story itself is a compellingly realistic and plausible what-if tale that was released to the public in an atmosphere of frightening tension between the U . S . and Russia . So realistic , in fact , that they felt it necessary to including a disclaimer at the beginning of the film , in which the Air Force would like to assure the public that it has systems in place which would prevent such a thing from ever happening . The film begins with something that was news to me , that America kept a given number of B-52 bombers airborne 24 hours a day , 7 days a week , in the event that their destructive services might be suddenly needed , which itself is a sign of what the times were like back then . The story concerns a General who loses his mind and orders all airborne bombers to attack Russia , unprovoked . The men on board the planes are dumbstruck , of course , because they realize the meaning of this order . A brilliant Slim Pickens is in charge on board one of the planes , and there is a rumor that during the performance , he wasn't told that the film was a comedy , which may be one of the reasons his comic performance is so brilliant , because this is exactly the kind of comedy that Kubrick loves and excels with . As Roger Ebert once noted , a man wearing a funny hat is not funny . But a man who doesn't KNOW he's wearing a funny hat . . . I have three favorite interactions in the film . The first is the isolated interaction between the crazy general and one of Sellers ' performances , Colonel Mandrake , who is stuck with the general and forced to listen with increasing agitation and disbelief to the general's explanations for why it is so imperative to strike the Russians immediately ( " A foreign substance is introduced into our precious bodily fluids without the knowledge of the individual ! " ) . This is funny to me because I have a close friend who's wife is absolutely convinced that the American government is doing this to its own citizens right now as I write this , in early 2008 . She should watch this film . The second performance I love is Sellers ' portrayal of Dr . Strangelove , although I'll admit that I remain a little confused as to why the film ended with his sudden exclamation that he can walk . I know there is something going on there that I'm missing but I just can't think of it . And last but not least , George C . Scott as the fanatical General Buck Turgidson . Scott's performance is so brilliant and in such deep detail that it's impossible to see it all in one viewing . I rewound all of his scenes two or three times and there is always something new . I think his might be the best performance in the movie . Watch , of course , for a young James Earl Jones on board the airplane , and of course Pickens ' exit from the airplane and the movie , which is one of the most famous moments in film history . And of course , since in China I especially appreciated this - listen for Mandrake's hilarious comment about his experience being tortured by the Japanese ! Only Peter Sellers could make something as real and disturbing as Japanese torture this funny !
Scary .	It really is a testament to the power of the story told by this film that it stars the French army and they all speak nothing but English , and yet it is still be incredibly moving and compelling . On the other hand , the movie is not really about war but about the soldiers , kind of like Full Metal Jacket . It is structured almost exactly the opposite , with the first half of the film taking place on the battlefield and the second half off . Kirk Douglas plays Col . Dax , whose platoon is ordered to take a hill called the Anthill against staggering odds , almost surely a suicide mission . As the men rush out of the trenches in an attempt to complete the mission , I was reminded of Gallipoli as they were all mowed down within feet of exiting the trenches . It becomes clear that the mission is , ahem , impossible , and is abandoned . Where the movie is truly great is in its characterizations and the complexity of their relationships with one another . Watch , for example , the roles that certain characters play at the beginning and where they end up near the end of the film , such as the General who ordered soldiers to fire on their own men and the man who abandons two of his men on a watch , resulting in one of their deaths and the subsequent court martial and trial of the other . The situations that they end up in are what make the movie powerful . Clearly , the accepted forms of punishment for failing to accomplish a mission are frightening . I have no idea how accurate they are as to French military practices at the time , but for three soldiers to be taken at random and tried and sentenced to death because their entire platoon failed in an impossible mission is scary indeed . I wonder how they would have handled a few soldiers who refused to go on a mission to deliver contaminated gasoline because the vehicles had almost no armor on them whatsoever . What is truly amazing to me is that Kubrick was able to make a movie about massive military injustice and still make the audience laugh at certain times . The cockroach scene , for example , is wonderful comic relief . You get a good laugh without losing sight of the drama and the importance of the rest of the film . It is not uncommon to read that this is the greatest anti-war film of all time , and while there are other anti-war films that I think rank right up there with Paths of Glory , this certainly is one of the greatest ever made .
Beautiful . A startlingly convincing portrayal of mental illness .	A Beautiful Mind is a difficult movie to review . I always think that the terrible movies are the most fun to review , because there's nothing better than slashing a movie like Scary Movie or Coyote Ugly that is obviously a belligerent mess , but it is the great films that allow for the presentation of some meaning in a review , and A Beautiful Mind presents a unique set of challenges in reviewing a great film . One way to begin to look at this film is to simply try to list the vast number of ways in which the film illuminates different elements of the human condition . There are the obvious ones , such as the problems associated with mental illness , as well as the fact that people who suffer from mental illness can be considered nothing other than victims , but are still all too often frightened and hurt by their treatment , but then there are less obvious ones , such as the fact that people truly are a product of their environment , and in the case of John Nash , that very environment lashes out at him when it is not processed correctly in his head . Whatever the extent to which these things are true , Nash's delusions are clearly a result of the stress involved in his education ( as well as the fact that , as they say , genius is often associated with madness ) , the stress involved with the type of work that his specialty leads to , and perhaps most importantly , Nash's perception of the government as cryptic and potentially dangerous , as well as his perception of the Russians as dangerous people who are constantly involved in some sort of conspiracy . Nash becomes a victim of that a government in his own mind as well as in the real world , although in the real world they are seeking to help him rather than to force him to perform work that he doesn't believe in . ( spoilers ) The first 45 minutes to an hour of A Beautiful Mind , admittedly , are hardly Oscar material , either the acting or directing or anything else , but once you realize that Nash's entire occupation with the government as well as his roommate were all in his head , then you go back and analyze the beginning of the film more closely with that knowledge . This is very much the same kind of plot twist that we saw in The Sixth Sense a couple years ago , except that it is much more applicable to real life in this case . The Sixth Sense was the portrayal of a sort of afterlife , the existence of which is very much debatable , while A Beautiful Mind is the portrayal of a man with schizophrenia , which is a very real and very incurable disease . The film is , in fact , virtually a textbook of schizophrenic symptoms and the workings of schizophrenia . One of my favorite things about In Dreams , a film that I truly enjoyed and I will stand by my assertion that it is a quality film , was the way that it presented the mental illness of Vivian Thompson ( Robert Downey Jr . ) , the rather unusual villain presented in that film . In fact , I think I said something in my review of In Dreams about how you should watch the movie if you want to know what it's like to be insane , but A Beautiful Mind is a much more mature , realistic , and convincing presentation of a more specific and more debilitating mental disease than whatever it was exactly that Vivian suffered from in In Dreams . This is not a psychological thriller , but an intensely humanitarian drama that powerfully delivers the extraordinary story of John Nash's life . There is just the right amount of humor in just the right places , Ron Howard's brilliant direction takes us through the unimaginable maze of schizophrenia , and you leave the film feeling that you have not only been entertained for two and a half hours , but that you have learned something important about one of the most devastating mental illnesses currently acknowledged and studied . There are thousands of things that you simply can't learn from reading a book , and the true nature of mental illnesses is obviously one of them . While I can't say whether or not A Beautiful Mind accurately depicted schizophrenia ( because I don't suffer from it , nor does anyone I know ) , I can say that it is an exceptional portrayal of the thing that victims of schizophrenia experience . Through his vast contributions to humanity despite being plagued by terrifying schizophrenic delusions , John Nash has entered the realm of mentally ill people who have truly done great things in spite of their illnesses , such as Kay Redfield Jamison and Sylvia Plath , both of whom have written startlingly enlightening books that illuminate their respective disorders . I've always thought that it would just be great to be as recognized and respected as Nash has become , with the condition that I would not have to suffer through all of the hardships that he went through . John Nash has more than earned his fame , both because of his illness and because of his accomplishments ( although potentially not because of either of them alone ) , and A Beautiful Mind is a fantastic film that brings it all to the screen for the public to see and to learn and benefit from .
" Shot While Trying to Escape . "	This documentary spends some time talking about what really happened , as it pertains to how things were different in the movie , but I like that it spends more time telling more of the story than the movie was able to , even in its lengthy running time . When the news of the mass escape reaches Hitler , the documentary explains , he flew into a rage and ordered that the men be killed , and it was Himmler , the head of the Gestapo , that chose the number 50 for how many should be shot . Having seen Downfall recently , it's even easier to picture Hitler flying into an uncontrollable rage and ordering people to be shot . MAN that guy was nuts . So the actual escape happened in freezing temperatures in the middle of winter , one of those things that was changed for the film ( I have a theory that it was changed because of location concerns , which are explained in one of the other outstanding featurettes on the Great Escape bonus disc , and in an interview one of the escapees expresses amazement that they weren't caught sooner , since it was so cold outside and so hot inside their tunnel that there was a column of steam rising out of it into the night . This same interviewee goes on to give an account of his escape that is heartbreaking , to say the least . The story of the 50 men being shot brings up some major questions about how to carry out justice . As one of the German guards who did some of the shooting explains , " I knew what I was told to do was wrong . I said so , and I was told to get on with it . If I had refused , someone else would have done it . If we had all refused , we would all have been shot . " How do you bring justice to a situation like that ? When the ultimate fates of the German officers who did the shooting are explained it's hard not to think that they all got what they deserved , but whatever your feeling as to who should have been punished for their crimes , I like that this documentary shows what it may very well have been like for those German soldiers as individuals . It puts a face on the stories of the people on the other side who were following orders and allows you to come to your own conclusion . James Cochran was arrested right on the Swiss border , within sight of freedom . The sister of one of the men who was shot explains that her brother was on the run for seven days and she wants to know what his life was like during that week , but never will . At the end of the documentary , one of the surviving escapees says that he doesn't think the whole thing was worth it , given how it all panned out , and while the escape was a tremendous , heroic effort , I think he was right , but not because of any fault of the men . If they had just sat in the prison , they would have been disobeying orders to consistently try to escape if captured , but it's probably most likely that they would all have lived to see the end of the war and their families again . Sadly , we'll never know .
A spectacular portrayal of the unseen life of Charlie Chaplin .	Robert Downey Jr . , first of all , portrays Chaplin with amazing accuracy . Some parts of this performance are particularly memorable , such as his invention of the famous tramp's walk just after having feverishly picked out the outfit , the astonishingly accurate depiction of Charlie as an old man , and of course , the many parts of the film that involve parts of his life where he was working on his own films . These are clearly some of the most interesting parts of the movie , if only because these films are how we know him , but it is at least as interesting the way that the film hints towards things that happened in Chaplin's life that inspired those films . Very early in the film , we see a scene in which Charlie's mother is booed off the stage by an impatient crowd , so Charlie , who is a little boy at the time , gets on stage to do a song and dance of his own . He performs a song that is very similar to the one his mother performed , but he wins the audience's heart and they respond by tossing coins onto the stage for him . You can't help noticing how this corresponds with the constantly youthful look of the Tramp ( in Modern Times , for example , Chaplin was in his late 40s but looked like a teenager ) , and the coins tossed on stage may have played a significant role in helping him realize that this could be a good way to make money . Charlie moves to America to pursue his dream , and we see the landmark events that punctuated his dizzying rise to stardom . He goes to work briefly on stage and is then hired by Mack Sennett , a gigantic figure in film history , but is unsatisfied because of his own lack of control over his work . It should also be noted here that there is a scene where he is working with director Mabel Normand , who demands acting from him that he does not agree with , and with whom he clashes . In 1914 , Chaplin starred in a 9 ½ minute film called Mabel's Busy Day , in which he plays the uncharacteristic role of the antagonist . The Mabel in this film is a sporting event vendor who turns down Charlie's amorous advances , after which Charlie proceeds to steal all of her products and hand them out to anyone standing nearby . Then in 1920 , he starred in another short comedy called Mabel's Strange Predicament , in which Mabel is a woman who becomes locked out of her hotel room in her pajamas and ends up avoiding the drunken Charlie for the rest of the film . In both films , Charlie plays uncharacteristic roles , the most unenviable of which was in Mabel's Busy Day , which Mabel Norman directed . Later in the film we see Charlie in a small diner just after having terminated his employment with Mack Sennett , and he meets Edna Purviance in a scene that is reminiscent of his romantic endeavors in such early films as Caught In A Cabaret and , even more so , The Immigrant , one of his most famous early films . There are dozens of other references to the development of his cinematic personality - such as his sudden realization of how to make the Tramp appear rich to the blind girl in City Lights without talking , as well as the dance of the dinner rolls , which Charlie performs here at a dinner at an expensive restaurant - but there is an even more significant portrayal of Charlie's beliefs and his values in this movie that are more recognizable as well as more memorable to people not familiar with his earlier and less known work . Charlie Chaplin was one of many filmmakers ' in the earlier times of the medium that resented and disapproved of the coming of sound to the movies . His Tramp remains one of the most recognized figures in the history of the cinema , and it is widely known that the Tramp is an almost entirely silent character , so it is necessary for a film about Chaplin's life to address this in some way , and it is done perfectly here . There is a scene where Charlie's brother is trying to convince him to add spoken dialogue into his films and Charlie refuses outright , giving a hilarious example of a Russian ballet dancer and saying , ' The Tramp CAN'T talk . The minute he talks , he's dead . ' This is a brilliant way to illustrate Charlie's fondness for the silent film , as well as his knowledge that no voice given to the Tramp would fit his character right . He was too well known to be changed so profoundly . Charlie Chaplin created 81 movies in his lifetime , many of them timeless and truly memorable , and has made a significant impact on the filmmaking medium as well as on the world itself . He was a fascinating personality both onscreen and off , which is another element of his life that was necessarily and skillfully presented in this film , this time directly in the dialogue in what is probably the single most important line in the entire film ? ' If you want to understand me , watch my movies . ' Chaplin's ever-present sympathy for the underprivileged is subtly but effectively portrayed as two poor people approach him on his way out of a nice restaurant , right at the beginning of the Great Depression , asking for his autograph . The elderly Charlie notes in retrospect that , ' I wish they'd wanted my money . ' He is always aware throughout the film and throughout his life of the difficulties constantly facing poor people , and he wants to give these people not only an escape with his films , but hope for the future . There is a point in the film where Charlie has returned to Europe to see an old friend , and he learns on the train that she has died . He is then asked , ' What'll we do , Charlie ? ' And his answer , although spoken under his breath almost in a whisper , rings louder than anything else in the film . ' Smile . '
" If one doesn't have words how does one think ? "	Iris is one of those dramas that is so startlingly well acted and accurate to reality that you truly see the people on screen suffering through the story rather than the actors portraying them . And in a film that stars Judi Dench , that is a remarkable achievement . Dench and Kate Winslet are made to look so similar that when the film jumps back and forth between past and present , which it does quite often , it is never jarring no matter how abrupt it is . The young Iris , played by Winslet , is similar to the character that she played in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind in many ways . She is sexually adventurous without being promiscuous , independent without being unfriendly or unattached , and dependent without being needy or reliant . She ultimately pursues a successful career as a novelist , which serves to illustrate her love and dependence on words and to enhance the effect of her deterioration later in the film . Iris is famously a study of Alzheimer's disease , which is the kind of thing that rarely makes its way into mainstream films , so it is that much more moving that a movie as brilliant as this one takes on the subject and brings it to the forefront in such a dramatic fashion . Iris goes from being a tremendously successful novelist to not understanding which side of an open door she should pass in order to get through it . As she loses touch with reality and experiences more and more difficulty in speaking and understanding , the most moving scenes are the ones that show the suffering that her husband goes through before his own deterioration . Iris has spent her life exploring things like what it is that makes people happy and what makes them realize that they are happy once they are , and then shows as she loses touch with those things without even realizing it . Her husband , John Bayley , in a brilliant performance by Jim Broadbent , is the only man who she has ever been with that has truly loved her , and he is the one that has to watch her cognitive abilities decline . He is literally watching the love of his life slip away from him without her even realizing it . The film is beautifully shot and the musical score enhances the film spectacularly and unobtrusively . It brings out the emotions in a movie about losing not only memory , but about losing the your identity , losing yourself . The gradual nature of the onset of Alzheimer's disease is one of the most brilliantly presented elements in the film . There is a conversation that Iris and her husband have in which she gives him a quote , which he responds to in a way that shows his own mental decline , and then Iris ' as well . Iris - " Between two evils always choose the one you haven't tried before . " John - " Mae West . Oh my vest ! I tore my vest again this morning ! " Iris - " You must get some new vests . " John ? " Jolly good ? " Iris ? " You must get some new vests , " then , surprised at herself , " I just said that . " This all kind of makes me wonder , because it is not very rare that I will ask someone a question that I already asked and they already answered , sometimes only a minute or two before , and when they tell me I just asked them that question I have to explain that I just wasn't sure if I had asked them out loud or just thought the question in my head . Where the answer ever went in my brain remains a mystery . It is very important that the movie spends so much time showing how much of a fiercely intelligent philosopher ( in Kate Winslet's words ) Iris Murdock was , because it emphasizes the totality with which Alzheimer's affects her ability to think . As a young woman she could talk circles around people , but when she grew older and Alzheimer's began to set in she became confused by the simplest concepts , and the difficulty that her husband found in attempting to explain things to her and hide what must have been his overwhelming emotion . I'm in the middle of reading a wonderful book by Sidney Lumet called Making Movies , and I just finished a chapter on actors , in which there is a section where he described some actors who believe so strongly in the material of a film that they will do whatever it takes to get the movie made . Many actors have taken salaries far below their usually asking prices in order to participate in a movie about which they felt very strongly , and Iris is one of those movies , although I don't know whether or not any of the actors took smaller salaries than they deserved . There is a short documentary on the DVD called ' A Look at Iris ' in which the cast and crew talk about the movie , and it is clear how strongly they feel about the film . Kate Winslet nails it on the head in one clip , where she says that she knows that people who knew the real Iris Murdock would see the movie , so it was all the more important that she get the character exactly right . I love that . In Iris's own words , " If one doesn't have words how does one think ? " That's exactly the question that this movie so touchingly explores . It is about people loving and then losing each other with torturous slowness , in one of the most moving and important films of 2001 .
No parrots were sprayed with a firehose during the making of this film .	The Three Stooges are here the primary witnesses in a trial in which someone's life is at stake . What a great premise , put the Three Stooges in the middle of a life and death situation and try to get them to act normal ! Needless to say , there is plenty of room for their classic slapstick comedy routines , and they make the most of it . This film clearly stars Curly , as he is the only witness who is made to eventually take the stand . The scene where the bailiff tries in vain to get Moe to simultaneously take off his hat , raise his right hand and put his left hand on the Bible is a great example of some of the simple but brilliant gags that this group was so famous for . It reminded me of something that Chaplin might have done . There is also a great sequence in which the stooges perform one of their musical acts , thinking that it is a much better way to show what happened than to try to answer nonsensical questions while on the stand . I can't help thinking that Moe always comes off as so mean-spirited in the Stooges ' films , but I guess it should be seen as a testament to their wonderful ability to work together that he can pulls Curly's hair and smack Moe in the face and head and poke them both in the eyes and it's still hilarious . This is one of the first of the Three Stooges ' films that I've ever seen , and yet I know all of their tricks and sound gags and trademarks because they are some of the most famous things in film history . Larry's smacking them around , Moe's trademark laugh and odd hand gestures , etc . Certainly a must-see not only for fans of the Stoogres ' but for fans of comedy .
Fight da powah !	Okay , time has reduced the music to an embarrassing joke , at least that of Public Enemy , but Do The Right Thing still retains its meaning . Luckily Bob Marley and Spike Lee's father contribute some quality music to the film . Do The Right Thing is a tremendous achievement from Spike Lee that boldly approaches the white-hot subjects of race and class relations and leaves us with an ambiguous but hugely effective ending . The film starts off with the horrifyingly annoying newcomer Rosie Perez on a soundstage with a rotating background of what appears to be Lee's ideal neighborhood , engaging in some sort of nutty activity that must have at one time vaguely resembled dancing . ( spoilers ) The entire movie takes place over the course of one tremendously hot day in Brooklyn , in which the neighborhood's racial tensions build up and build up and ultimately explode in a riot that results in the total destruction of a beloved pizzeria and the death of one of the neighborhood youths . The film contains a surprising array of very colorful ( no pun intended ) characters , and the narrative structure moves along at a realistic pace but is able to keep your attention throughout the film . The film successfully manages several different storylines that all take place simultaneously and all add to the escalation of racial conflict that explodes at the end of the film . We see Sal , the owner of the town's pizzeria , and his sons as they interact with the residents of the inner city neighborhood in which the pizzeria operates and where they never fully feel that they belong . They are racial outsiders , but the have run a good business for years in the community which seems to be Lee's effort to prove that racially different people can live together happily . John Turturro is excellent as Pino , Sal's older son who is the less tolerant one towards the black people in the neighborhood . One of the more interesting about the movie is the title . After watching it , it seems that the right thing that the title refers to is the single act of Mookie throwing that trash can through the front window of Sal's Pizzeria at the end of the film . It seems like this is an vicious act against Sal's business , but you have to keep in mind the scene up to that point . Sal and his sons were cornered in front of the store by a mob angered by the death of Radio Raheem , one of the town's charming youths , and Mookie knows that the three of them are in danger . When he threw the can through the window , he took the mob's anger and redirected from Sal and his sons and onto the store . He probably saved their lives . There was clearly something right about that initially questionable thing that Mookie did . There is obviously going to be a lot of controversy about a movie like this because it deals with the hotly debated issue of racial relations , but you really have to analyze it before you can make any accusations , because it is a very complex film . Spike Lee manages to create a movie that starts off with almost endlessly entertaining comedy but ultimately winds up as a tremendously powerful and moving film , a technique hardly ever seen , but when it's done right , as is the case here and in other films like Life Is Beautiful , the result is that much more effective .
Absolutely compelling .	One of my favorite episodes was number five , particularly the subway scene and the scene where the men are getting ready for the final advance and see the enormous line of soldiers falling back , having been ambushed and their numbers decimated . The subway scene is one of the best ones in the entire series that illustrates the connection between the battlefield and civilian life . Major Winters , played by Damian Lewis who later makes a huge left turn in his acting career , playing Jonesy in Stephen King's Dreamcatcher , reluctantly accepts a weekend pass to spend some time in Paris , and while on a subway train he looks around at the other passengers and each face brings him a flashback from the battlefield , one of which being the soldier that he runs into after coming over a hill and , while the man signals his helplessness , shoots dead with one shot ( okay , three shots , for effect ) . At first this might look a little cheesy , the hardened soldier getting his first look at relatively normal society after so long on the battlefield , but that is exactly what it was like for these guys ( NOTE : I have never been in battle and so have no basis for saying that last sentence ) . The thing that I liked was that he saw these people on the subway and was reminded of dramatic moments in battle involving people that looked like them . So yeah , I may never have been in battle or served any time in the military , but I love this connection between civilian life and the battlefield , because it is something that the audience of a war film often does not do until they leave the theater or turn off the film , and the effect is intensified when it is one of the actual characters in the film making that connection himself ( NOTE : I've seen tons of war films and so have plenty of basis for saying that last sentence ) . It is moments like this that really make you see the severity of what these guys went through . In the scene with the retreating soldiers , we see the ironically named Easy Company awaiting their orders to advance , with little ammunition , food , or winter clothing , and when they see this line of soldiers retreating it takes them several seconds before they think to start grabbing ammunition and rations off of these guys because of the shock of what they're seeing . I could hardly stand to see them let a single soldier walk by without taking his ammo and grenades and everything , but then again , these guys are faced with a whole line full of revelations that they're almost certainly about to walk to their deaths , so they were probably not thinking quite as clearly as I was . In casually perusing other reviews of Band of Brothers , I'm glad that not many people are simply comparing it to Saving Private Ryan , because even though Spielberg was the executive producer and Tom Hanks was a director , it is really not in the shadow of Saving Private Ryan . This is an outstanding rendering of the true stories of Easy Company during World War II , and I'm happy to see that so many people have recognized that . It's hard to follow up a movie like Saving Private Ryan that is about the same topic without being immediately compared to that movie , but since Band of Brothers has done it to a large extent , I think it's a testament to the quality of the miniseries itself . Band of Brothers has set all kinds of records for the small screen , and smartly avoids mostly all of the clichés that are seen in so many war films , even clichés of the great films like Private Ryan ( such as stereotypical characters that have stereotypical relationships with each other ) or of the bad ones , like Pearl Harbor ( such as the obligatory romances , the loved ones left behind , etc ) . Band of Brothers is a very straightforward and shockingly graphic and detailed description of the hardships that these men endured while performing their service to America , hardships which are only dulled and pushed aside by the greedy pulling of emotional heartstrings by Hollywood executives . Each episode opens with interviews with several of the actual men from Easy Company talking about some of the experiences that that episode deals with , and these interviews are fleshed out even more in a sixth DVD which should not be overlooked ! This is an outstanding achievement . Yes , it's roughly ten hours long , but that allows an even better opportunity to get to know the characters , and the episodes are designed so that you become connected to them as people , not as characters , and their experiences are presented in such starling detail and realism that it is virtually impossible not to be moved .
