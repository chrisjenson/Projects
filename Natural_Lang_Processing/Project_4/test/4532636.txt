Worthless	" Crank " is 50 minutes of some of the worst film-making I have ever seen . Why 50 minutes , you ask , when the film's running time is 87 minutes ? Because that's all I could get through before I gave up on a piece of trash that didn't even deserve that much of my time . There are hundreds , nay thousands , of films out there that I'd like to see , and life is way too short to waste on something like this . I can't believe anyone save the most imbecilic of gangster thug wannabes could enjoy this film . I kept picturing a bunch of square suburban white kids watching this in their parents ' basement and giggling over how naughty it is . The film is self-concsiously envelope pushing in a juvenile sort of way , and it tries for a tone of outrageous humor that's painfully tortured . But there's absolutely nothing funny - - and much that is actually quite disturbing - - about many of the scenes that are played for laughs , like an inexplicable one where a bad guy is getting a blow job while feeding pieces of raw meat to angry dogs , or another where Jason Statham's character pretty much rapes his girlfriend in the middle of a busy market until she's so turned on that she joins in voluntarily . Garbage .
Wretched Piece of Instantly Disposable Crap	I hate this movie . I hate the way it looks . I hate the way the actors ( especially Leslie Caron ) sound . I hate the way it's dubbed . I hate how irrelevant it is . Is it just me , or is there something incredibly distasteful ( not to mention creepy ) to see an 80-something Maurice Chevalier singing " Thank Heaven for Little Girls " while ogling them in a park ? Maybe pedophilia didn't exist in turn-of-the-century Paris . I can't believe this gloopy piece of cotton eye candy came out in the same year as Orson Welles ' " Touch of Evil . " And don't even get me started on the fact that it won what was then a record number of Oscars ( including Best Picture ) . If nothing else in its dubious history convinces one to ignore the Motion Picture Academy , that should . Can anyone honestly tell me they cared at all about how this movie ended ? If you can , I never want to meet you .
Needlessly Savage and Not Remotely Scary	My wife recently planned a night out with her girlfriends , so I had the T . V . to myself and the chance to watch some movies she wouldn't want to see . I had a hankering for some good old fashioned vintage porn and a good scary movie , so I rented this , " Debbie Does Dallas " and " Taboo . " Of the three films I rented , " The Hills Have Eyes " was by far the most pornographic , and the last of the bunch I'd want my child ( if I had one ) to see . It astounds me that the MPAA will give a movie like " 9 Songs " ( which does happen to be a lousy movie ) an NC-17 rating , virtually guaranteeing that no mainstream movie theatre will carry it , just because it depicts real sex between real people , and then turn around and give a movie like " Hills " an R . What kind of sick world do we live in when the sight of penetration is believed to be more damaging to our youth than the sight of people getting axe picks through their heads and their intestines ripped out ? And lest you think I'm just a cranky prude , let me say that I love horror movies , and I'm always on the outlook for good ones ( " The Descent " happened to be fantastic ) but I've nearly given up hope that today's batch of filmmakers know the first thing about what scares people . I'm not opposed to gore , and I think it can be used effectively ( again , " The Descent " ) . My objections to " The Hills Have Eyes " rest almost entirely on the fact that it's not effective horror . It's gruesome , to be sure , and it does inspire a sort of visceral reaction from the viewer , but so would a car accident . I've not seen the original Wes Craven version , but the film that this most reminded me of , 1974's " The Texas Chainsaw Massacre , " gave me close to the same feeling , except that Tobe Hooper's film is unbelievably scary in addition to being nauseating , and it uses true film-making skills to scare the pants off of you , not simply digitally enhanced makeup and sound effects . It depresses me that there's a market for movies like " The Hills Have Eyes . " I must be getting older , because I'm starting to worry about the state of our country's youth . Doesn't anyone have the attention span anymore to be scared by a clever , psychological thriller , or even a sophisticated slasher film like " Chainsaw Massacre " or " Halloween , " where your imagination did the work that computers do now ? Horror movies used to be fun - - now they're just exhausting . I used to come away from then scared but exhilarated - - now I come away just feeling bad . It's hard to have fun in a movie that shows a woman's baby being held at gunpoint so that a sadistic mutant can suck on her boobs , and then shoot her in the head anyway ; or in which a boy comes across the body of his dead mother being disemboweled and eaten . I don't believe that anyone should be stopped from making films like this ; I just wish people would have the brains to stop wanting to see them . Send a message to film directors and have them bring good horror back to the screens .
In the Running for Most Boring Movie Ever Made	I can't imagine this gargantuan historical epic being of interest to anyone . As a serious piece of film , it's far too wooden and dull to appeal to cinephiles ; but for the same reasons , it doesn't even satisfy those looking for trashy camp . In terms of its physical production , " Cleopatra " takes the " more is better " approach , and stuffs every frame with gawdy set and costume details . Everything about the film is enormous ; as a result , all of the actors are buried beneath a hopeless pile of Technicolor . Everyone walks around delivering stiff speeches , but no one really develops a character . The only person who manages to infuse the film with some life is Rex Harrison , so his departure from the film at the half-way point ( with 2 + hours still to go ! ) is utterly demoralizing . The film grinds to a slower and slower pace as the remainder progresses , like an unwound music box , until by the end you can almost literally hear the DVD player laboring to spin the DVD around . This stinker landed with a huge thud at the time of its release , and it lands with a thud now . No amount of perspective can save it .
Witheringly Boring Heights	" Wuthering Heights " is a florid , over-heated , dull Gothic romance based on a florid , over-heated , dull Gothic novel . This movie and everything about it grated on me - - why it's considered to be such a classic ( and worthy of placement on the AFI's list of 100 greatest films of all time ) I'll never know . I guess it is unique in that it brings a level of psychological complexity to the romantic melodrama that films hadn't really seen to that point . And it introduced Laurence Olivier ( he of the massive chin dimple ) , who would go on to become one of the most admired of screen actors , to American audiences . But beyond that my praise ends . The rest is a brooding bore , with a love story I didn't give a rat's ass about . The star of the movie is the sterling black and white cinematography courtesy of Gregg Toland , who would go on to top himself in " The Grapes of Wrath " the following year and " Citizen Kane " the year after that . With simple lighting alone , he can load a shot of a clanging gate or a fluttering curtain with psychological import . But the problem with this movie is that it's ALL psychological import and zilch compelling drama . It's the kind of movie that lends itself easily to movie stills but is completely devoid of life in every other respect . Thumbs up for the cinematography . As for everything else . . . Blech !
Unnecessary Sequel Does Everything Wrong	A terrible and unpleasant sequel to the surprise hit from 1984 . Though it reassembles most of the cast from the original , including Eddie Murphy in the role that made him a big-screen movie star , all of the other elements that made the first one so enjoyable are gone . Director Tony Scott seems to be absolutely clueless about what made the first one so popular and fresh - - in other words , the comedy - - and instead focuses on aggressive violence and action . The song " Shakedown " was nominated for an Academy Award , but otherwise the film doesn't even boast as good a soundtrack as the original .
This Round Table Is as Square as They Come	A lumbering screen version of the hit Broadway musical . " Camelot " came out at a time when Hollywood was losing its ability to make good screen musicals . Partly , audience taste was changing , and quaint stuff like " Camelot " just looked dated and irrelevant next to films like " The Graduate " or " Bonnie and Clyde . " But much of the blame falls to the filmmakers themselves , who tried to impose a trendy 1960s visual style on material rooted to the stage , and the results were gangly and ugly . " Camelot " is one of the worst examples of this - - it's a terrible looking film . However , the reason for its complete failure lies in its casting , which gets just about everything wrong . Vanessa Redgrave is certainly beautiful enough for the part of Guinevere , but she looks bored by her part and gives a vapid , listless performance . She also looks incredibly uncomfortable with the fake singing duties she's asked to perform . All of the same things are wrong with Richard Harris , who on paper would seem to make a perfect King Arthur . The Lerner and Loewe musical score , never one of my favorites anyway , sounds bad as it's presented here . And Joshua Logan , true to form , wields his camera like a bowling ball . Everything feels heavy , sluggish and ponderous . The 1960s had its musical hits ( " West Side Story , " " The Sound of Music " ) and its misses . Guess which category " Camelot " falls into .
A Sorry Attempt to Capitalize on an Established Hit - - Sound Familiar ?	This woeful follow up to the accomplished 1941 original " Wolf Man " provides proof that the Hollywood of today has not cornered the market on stupid , unoriginal and unnecessary sequels . The dynamite premise behind this film - - putting Lon Chaney's wolf man and Dr . Frankenstein's monster ( here played unmenacingly by Bela Lugosi ) in the same movie and watching them duke it out - - is no more than a gimmick to get you to watch , and very little duking goes on between the two . In fact , they're not really even together for more than 5-10 minutes of screen time . The rest of the film is a talky bore driven by a plot more full of holes than a piece of Swiss cheese . The movie goes on for about 70 minutes and then just ends , like someone pulled the switch on the camera and shut things down whether or not the film had come to any kind of conclusion .
Dud Sequel to Tobe Hooper's Memorable Ghost Story	A lame follow up to the phenomenally successful and tremendously entertaining 1982 spook fest about a normal suburban family terrorized by ghouls . The same strong leads ( JoBeth Williams and Craig T . Nelson ) return , and I give this movie credit for not simply making a carbon copy of the first film the way so many sequels do , but this film is DOA . The screenplay is too obtuse and ambitious , working in a bunch of mystical hoo-hah involving Native Americans and a creepy demon who goes door to door like a traveling salesman . Not one moment in the film comes close to rivaling any number of thrilling moments in the first one .
A Grueling , Miserable Story for Kids	Does anyone still submit his children to this ? I spent 22 of the most agonizing minutes of my life watching this feel-bad puppetoon made for T . V . movie . In this charmer , Nestor is mercilessly ridiculed by everyone because of his long ears , is nearly kidnapped by Roman soldiers who are stealing donkeys for use by the Empire and runs away with the help of his mom , only to watch her freeze to death during a snowstorm . Merry freakin ' Christmas . Only watch this if you think that giving the Virgin Mary a ride into Bethlehem is gift enough to make up for a miserable , wretched existence . Cynic that I am , I didn't buy it .
Chaplin Made This ?	I find it interesting that Chaplin himself considered this to be his most clever and witty film , because I thought it was desultory and downright boring . It's supposed to be a black comedy about a cad ( Chaplin ) who plays women like violins and then murders them , but there's little to no humour to be found here . I suppose it could be one of those films you have to see more than once to appreciate - - that's happened to me before and could happen to me again ; and since I like Chaplin usually , I would be more than willing to give this another shot . But until I do , my negative review stands .
A Limp Costume Drama to End the Decade	This drippy costume drama is the worst of the flurry of similarly-themed films that came out in the 1960s and include movies like " Becket , " " A Man for All Seasons , " and " The Lion in Winter . " When you compare " Anne of the Thousand Days " to all of the other terrific and exciting movies coming out in 1969 - - " Easy Rider , " " The Wild Bunch , " " Midnight Cowboy , " " Z " - - it's simply impossible to care a whit for something so stodgy , plodding and uninspired . Richard Burton is at his hammiest worst as Henry VIII - - he mistakes shouting for good acting , and every line is pitched to the second balcony . Genevieve Bujold , as Anne Boleyn , fares better , but really , the screen is supposed to crackle whenever she and Burton are on it together , but instead it just sort of gives an indifferent shrug , as did I when this movie was over . This is one of those movies that's so intent on being classy that it forgets to be remotely engaging .
The Ultimate Fad Movie	" Forrest Gump " is the ultimate fad movie . It came out big in 1994 and created a cultural sensation . It was easy to get swept up in its panorama of American cultural history , and all of the iconic imagery in the film made it seem like it was saying something important . But all these years later , this treacly piece of rubbish is nearly intolerable . The film is full of easy sentiment and false emotion . It depicts one thing after another ( the Kennedy assassination , Vietnam , Watergate , the AIDS crisis ) that trigger automatic emotional responses in the audience , so that the filmmakers don't have to do any work of their own to make the material effective . But underneath the lesson in American history and the admittedly terrific soundtrack , I can't help but wonder what point the movie tries to make . Are we to applaud Forrest for his pluck and resiliency when the only reason for them is the fact that he's too simple minded to understand the things that happen to him ? Are we supposed to emulate him ? Is the message that we all make life too complicated , and that we all need to buckle down to the only things that really matter , like love of country , God and our dear ol ' mama ? If so , gag . Tom Hanks is a winning presence in the film , and if anyone was going to be able to carry this story along , I imagine he did just as good a job as anyone else would have . But the only character worth watching as far as I'm concerned is poor little Jenny , played valiantly by Robin Wright Penn , who comes closer than anyone to playing an actual human being , despite the film's tendency to chew her character up and spit her out . This movie is like a box of chocolates . . . too much of it and you'll be sick .
Work It , Jennifer	A female welder ( yes , you read that correctly ) dreams of being a ballerina - - all she needs to do is convince the audition committee for an elite dancing school that she has what it takes . Boy does she ever , showing them that stripper moves and ballet aren't mutually exclusive , all set to the top 40 sounds of Irene Cara . Welcome to the 1980s , folks , and more specifically , to the run of dance movies clearly inspired by the look and feel of MTV , this one starring Jennifer Beals . " Flashdance " is ridiculous , but would it be anywhere nearly as fun to watch now if it weren't ?
Can You Please Stop Singing ? We're Trying to Have the Last Supper Here . . . . .	Andrew Llod Webber's kitchsy musical about the last days of Christ is given a rather limp screen treatment by director Norman Jewison , who never found a story he couldn't pound the life out of . One doesn't watch ALW musicals for their dramatic depth in the first place , so it was a mistake to dilute whatever dramatic significance there was to this story by using a framing device showing a group of hippies arrive in the desert to put on a show about the last days of Christ . Was this a Hollywood capitulation to the controversy that stormed around the musical's Broadway opening ? Probably , but one wishes the filmmakers had had the balls to stick to their guns . What one DOES watch ALW musicals for is the music , and " Jesus Christ Superstar " boasts one of his best scores . It sounds hopelessly dated here , but I kind of like the twangy 70s sound ; it fits the material . A handful of unknowns star , and none of them has much screen presence . However , I did have the opportunity to see a stage version of this not so long ago in Chicago that starred the film Jesus and Judas , Ted Neely and Carl Lewis , along with Irene Carra as Mary Magdalene and former Styx lead singer Dennis DeYoung as Pontius Pilate , and it was one of the best stage shows I've ever seen .
Saved By Diane Lane	Diane Lane is a fascinating actress to watch . Her face is always doing something interesting , and she has a winning , winsome quality to her that makes you automatically root for her . She takes the role she's given here and actually does things with it that other actresses probably couldn't . Otherwise , this film is the visual equivalent of Diet Soda : canned , bland and full of sugar . It should appeal to the Oprah crowd or people who love reality shows about people's homes being remodeled . It's harmless enough , but it has that sort of lazy , vapid quality that makes you wonder why anybody thought it was really worth turning into a movie in the first place .
A Movie About Smart Dumb People and Dumb Smart People	With a title like " Smart People , " you just know there's a lesson to be learned in this movie , and that it probably has something to do with people who think they're smarter than they are . Those people are Dennis Quaid , a tiresome boor of a college lit professor who nobody likes , and his equally tiresome and snarky daughter , played by Ellen Page as a young Republican version of Juno . These two pompous asses make snap judgements about everybody and think nobody's worth wasting the time to interact with . Of course , in both cases , the characters are making up for insecure deficiencies , brought about mostly by the death of their wife and mother . The dumb people who end up being smarter than the smart people are Thomas Haden Church , as a loaf of an adopted brother who has a fondness for laying around with his bare ass waving in the wind ; and Sarah Jessica Parker , as an emergency room doctor and former student of Quaid's who strikes up a romance with him . O . k . , so she was pretty smart to begin with , but not in the way that Quaid and Page think she should be . . . . you get the point . What does all of this add up to , you ask ? A movie that I had forgotten about as soon as I stowed away my half-eaten box of Junior Mints and began strolling toward the exit . " Smart People " isn't a bad movie , but it's an awfully inconsequential one . It doesn't add up to anything , and that's o . k . - - some of the best movies are those that don't try to change the world . But a movie needs to have SOMETHING - - either a plot or characters to care about , one or two original ideas , a fancy style . This has none of these things . The plot is lazy and has a been-there-done-that quality to it . It just sort of meanders along until it reaches a hastily-realized happy ending . Paradoxically , though there are really only four main characters , I felt like none of the actors had enough screen time to really flesh their characters out . Or more precisely , they didn't have good enough material to make use of the screen time they were given . Poor Thomas Haden Church gets the worst of this . On paper , it would appear that his brother / uncle character is important to the story , but the way it plays out , it feels like Church showed up on the set one day and everyone scrambled around to find stuff for him to do . His character doesn't feel at all integrated into the movie , even though he's the one we'd rather be spending our time with . " Smart People " feels like what it probably is : a movie about a very specific milieu that either the writer or director ( or both ) have direct and personal experience with , but that they unsuccessfully translated into a universal story that anyone could appreciate . I was on a business trip and had nothing else to do , so I was able to just go with the flow and moderately enjoy this movie , but a must-see it most certainly isn't .
As Dry as a Civics Lesson	It's admittedly been a long time since I've seen " Young Mr . Lincoln , " but I recall that it plays more as an educational film you'd show in a civics class than as an engaging film . There was no one better to play Lincoln than Henry Fonda , with his willowy frame and haunted eyes . But director John Ford seems too intent on myth making to manufacture a drama that we care about . It's hard to have an emotional reaction to a myth . This film feels decidedly stoic and ponderous , showcasing none of the fluidity and crispness that Ford's own " Stagecoach , " released the same year , has . Rather dreary and dull .
Drag Out Your Period Garb for Another Uninspired Stroll Through History	Keira Knightley has become the go-to actress for portraying spunky feminist characters in period dramas . In her latest , she plays the Duchess of Devonshire , who challenges her husband's right to openly philander by doing some open philandering of her own . But of course she finds that double standards reign supreme , and we are shown the sacrifices a woman is willing to make in order to stay with her children . The movie is period designed to the hilt , and everything else about it ( writing , acting , directing ) is fine , but none of it is exceptional . Mostly , it just made me want to watch " Barry Lyndon " again . The movie doesn't distinguish itself from a hundred other period films you've seen that are just like it , and beyond the specifics of the Duchess's life ( which may be enough for some viewers ) , it doesn't tell us anything we don't already know . I take that back - - it did answer one question for me . If you're wondering whether or not all of those towering wigs surrounded by all of those burning candelabras ever resulted in a pyrotechnic mishap , they did . And punch comes in handy when you're trying to put out a fire .
Depp Nearly Ruins It	I usually like Johnny Depp's quirky approach to characters and credit him for making many films much better than they had any right being , but for once his instincts are off . In Tim Burton's new take on the classic children's story , he nearly derails the film with his weird , creepy interpretation of candy empresario Willy Wonka . It's not that I was comparing this to the Gene Wilder original ; I didn't much like that version either ( though I liked Wilder's performance more ) and thought Roald Dahl's book was due for a retry . And in the first 20 minutes , leading up to the day actually spent in the chocolate factory , Burton nails Dahl's story just right . In many ways it's a perfect matching of artist and source material , and the cordial relationship shows for a while . But once Depp enters the picture , Burton gives him free reign to walk away with it , but I didn't like where he took it . People have said Depp reminds them of both Carol Burnett and Michael Jackson . Throw Carol Channing and Frances McDormand from " Fargo " into the mix and you get a pretty good idea of how he plays the character . The thing is , the writers screwed up big time in giving Wonka so much back story and making him a character that begs for redemption . The great thing about Wonka in the book was that he wasn't explained ; he was a candy genius , his life was devoted to making great candy , end of story . The point Dahl was making was about proper ways for children to behave , not about reconnecting with your family , father / son relationships , blah , blah , blah . Dahl's book was perfection , so why mess with it ? Other than the awful additions , however , this film stays much truer to the book than the 1971 version . There are some great songs by Danny Elfman for the Oompah-Loompahs to perform , the bad kids are deliciously bratty , and Freddie Highmore is really winning as Charlie . Maybe in another 30 years they'll try to adapt this book again and get it right . Or people could just stop trying to make movies of the book and ( gasp ! ) actually read it instead .
Mercury Production Is No " Citizen Kane "	A rather innocuous collaboration between Joseph Cotten and Orson Welles , the final and weakest of the trio of films released by Welles ' Mercury studio ( the other two being " Citizen Kane " and " The Magnificent Ambersons " ) . " Journey Into Fear " plays like second-rate Graham Greene , with Cotten playing an American munitions dealer who finds himself the target of an assassination attempt by a group of Nazis . Much of the picture takes place on a seedy steamer intended to carry Cotten to safety . The film's got some nice touches , and there's a pretty exciting shoot-out finale that's something right out of Hitchcock , but the overall package isn't that memorable . Welles has a supporting role as a Turkish police chief and Welles regular Agnes Moorehead appears as a grumpy French woman . Cotten , the go-to actor for playing Americans stuck in the middle of foreign intrigues , wrote the screenplay .
Not Nearly as Good as the Original	Sadly , " After the Thin Man " is a very tepid follow up to the 1934 original . William Powell and Myrna Loy have just as much chemistry as before , but this film feels much more restricted by post-code conventions than did the first one . It's not as naughty and racy , and the pacing feels much more sluggish . I thought , as good as Myrna Loy was in the original " Thin Man " film , that she was underused and that William Powell dominated the movie . That is even more the case here , with Loy a decidedly supporting character . But it's still entertaining , and not many films are as good as the first " Thin Man , " so it had very high standards to meet . And the last scene of this film , providing a sort of cliff hanger segue into the next film in the series , is especially memorable .
Brings New Meaning to " Made to Order "	I haven't seen this movie for a long time , so for all I know it's horrible , but I have nothing but good memories of it . Any red-blooded American male has to at least appreciate the premise : two horny teens discover a way to create the perfect woman , who exists for no other purpose than to fulfill their every fantasy . Hot damn ! ! Their perfect woman is Kelly Le Brock , who wouldn't necessarily be my choice , but she'll do . John Hughes was on a roll with his teen comedy genre , and this film preserves the memorable performances of Anthony Michael Hall and a young Bill Paxton as the world's most obnoxious older brother .
Where Were My Heaving Bosoms ?	I was expecting heaving bosoms and bodice rippings galore from this costume drama , but sadly , the filmmakers and actors decide to take this piece of " historical " fiction seriously , and so " The Other Boleyn Girl " is not nearly as fun as it could have been . Either Natalie Portman , as Anne , or Scarlett Johansson , as Mary , is the " other " girl of the title , depending on your point of view . Both are paraded before King Henry VIII ( Eric Bana - - yeah right ! ) in an attempt to make one or the other his mistress and so establish the Boleyn family firmly in the king's favor . It's a vaguely feminist story - - the girls ' uncle and father pull the strings , while their mother ( Kristen Scott Thomas , underused ) stands in the background looking disapproving . But first and foremost , the film is a gussied up bit of Masterpiece Theatre starring beautiful Hollywood actors . The film is entertaining , but never fully engaging . For me , this was largely due to the casting . Natalie Portman is directed to play Anne Boleyn like a scheming villainess one moment , and a nobly suffering wife the next . The performance is uneven and unconvincing , and I'm not sure if the fault lies with Portman as an actress , the way the part is written , or the way she's directed to play it . Eric Bana does not have the physical presence or spirit to play Henry VIII , though the ladies in the audience should be happy , because the only bosoms to be seen in the movie belong to him . Let's just say that if Henry VIII had looked like Eric Bana , history might have turned out differently . The only actress who I felt truly did service to her role is Scarlett Johansson . Johansson gets a bad rap from people for some reason , but every time I see her in something , I'm impressed by how much I like her . I think she's a good actress who doesn't coast on her looks ( like she certainly could ) , and I wonder how this film would have come across if she and Portman had switched roles . Fans of elaborate costumes and production design should have fun with this movie .
Obvious Drama with Very Little Impact	At the beginning of his career , Steven Spielberg had an almost perverse desire to entertain his audiences . As a result , we were spellbound by his movies . Then he decided that he was going to make movies that were " good " for people , and he produced dreadful stuff like " Amistad . " Lately , he's been trying to merge the two approaches to storytelling , and his movies have suffered for it . His pure entertainments , like " War of the Worlds , " haven't been particularly entertaining , and his message movies , like " Saving Private Ryan , " have been short on message . " Munich " is further proof that Spielberg is just not an especially intelligent director . He wants to thrill us with a cloak and dagger story even while he's preaching to us . The problem is this : the thriller parts of " Munich " undercut the seriousness of the topic , yet they're the only really entertaining moments of the film . Tony Kushner has written a clunky screenplay that jars to a halt every twenty minutes or so to discuss the moral crisis at the center of the movie as if we've been invited to sit in on a civics class , rather than letting the crisis evolve naturally from the material or allowing the audience to do any of the work for itself , which it is entirely capable of doing . And the action movie sections , while admittedly exciting , are manipulative and reek of classic Spielberg . He just can't resist the pull of emotional bombast and resorts to cheap tricks in order to build suspense . For instance , in a scene in which the team of Israeli assassins has rigged one of their target's phones to blow up when it is answered , he goes out of his way to introduce a child into the scene to heighten the tension ; however , Spielberg is so predictable that we know a child will never die so aimlessly in one of his films . A truly original director would have made that scene suspenseful without pandering to our base emotions . And late in the film , during a scene in which Avner , the lead assassin , is making love to his wife while images of what happened to the Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics flash through his head , Spielberg's histrionics derail the movie altogether into pure camp . Never mind that Avner couldn't possibly be remembering what happened since he never actually witnessed the events in the first place - - at a moment when the film should be gripping , it's instead ridiculous . The movie has a terrific look , and reminded me of those gritty paranoid films from the early seventies , like " The French Connection " and " The Conversation . " Indeed , the look of the film and the skill with which it's put together will give people the illusion that's it a more important film than it really is , and will likely get it nominated for a buttload of Oscars . But in a year of such great movies that have already covered much of the same ground , " Munich " seems even further away from being an important film than it might in a more mediocre year . " A History of Violence " pretty much had the final word on the cyclical nature of violence and how it eventually degrades human morality ; and Steven Gaghan showed with " Syriana " that a political thriller can be intelligent and exciting all at the same time . I was impressed with Eric Bana , mostly because I've only seen him in " Hulk " and " Troy " and since those two movies don't comprise the world's most stunning acting resume , I was pleasantly surprised that he has quite a bit of skill . One senses that he didn't need Spielberg and company to stop the proceedings for the periodic lectures they wedge into the film ; he could have done just fine on his own . And no other actors really get much of a chance to develop characters we care about , which has always been and probably always will be a weakness in any Spielberg movie . I'm not Jewish or Palestinian , so I think I can speak pretty objectively to the fairness with which Spielberg approaches the topic . He makes an admirable attempt to address both sides , but the film's sympathies obviously lie with the Jews , and there a few moments when it takes on a self-righteous tone that threatens to tip the balance . However , Spielberg is Jewish , so I could easily excuse this . There's a haunting , powerful film to be made from the events detailed in this film , but " Munich " isn't it .
Movie Belongs to Carrey	I've not read the book series upon which this film is based , but I have a feeling it's just the sort of thing I would have loved when I was a kid : dark , morbid , twisted and funny . The movie benefits from a knock-out production design and a fun performance from Jim Carrey , who appears in an assortment of kooky costumes and identities and is allowed to ham it up as much as he wants . On the negative side , the children who serve as the film's focus are the dreariest kids to ever appear in a children's film ; the director can't drag a reaction from them to save his life . Each has one stock facial expression they use to respond to every situation : the boy widens his eyes and the girl purses her lips . The fun in the film is supposed to come from watching them foil Carrey again and again , yet I was rooting for Carrey the whole time . There's a bunch of other big names , some used more than others . Meryl Streep is a dotty aunt who's afraid of everything . Billy Connolly is a reptile expert . Mike Leigh regular Timothy Spall is the attorney in charge of seeing that the children are provided for by their legal guardian . All of these actors have a fair amount to do . However , others , like Dustin Hoffman and Jennifer Coolidge , make appearances that don't really even rate as cameos , and I'm not sure why they're in the film at all . And Jude Law , who has now proved that he was in just about every film released in 2004 , does narration duties . So overall " Lemony Snicket " is a fun but not especially memorable film . As far as children's films go , think more along the lines of Tim Burton than Walt Disney , but not as good as a Burton movie . And one more thing : this movie has the longest end credits I've ever seen .
Grand Hotel with Nazis	" Ship of Fools " reminded me of " Grand Hotel " : take a bunch of big-name stars , fit them out in a screenplay full of romantic melodrama , and watch everyone go to town . Unfortunately , the formula doesn't work so well when the backdrop for the story is pre-WWII Germany ; it makes the melodrama seem not only irrelevant , but also somewhat tasteless . I couldn't find much to care about in this film , despite its solid production values and talented cast . The doomed love affair at the center of the drama seems tailor made to bore one to death - - other plot lines , like the one involving George Segal and Elizabeth Ashley , get short shrift by the screenwriters . There are three reasons to see " Ship of Fools " : 1 . ) Michael Dunn , who gives a winsome and entirely winning performance as the diminutive narrator and speaks directly into the camera in a gimmick that shouldn't work but does 2 . ) Lee Marvin , giving a pleasingly unlikable performance as a belligerent American 3 . ) and Vivien Leigh , whose morose character at one point in the film breaks into a five-second spirited Charleston , which by itself makes the film worth sitting through .
Beautiful Looking But Profoundly Hollow	A triumph of style over substance . One can't overcome the feeling while watching " La Dolce Vita " that Federico Fellini thinks he's being terribly intellectual and profound , but there's precious little going on in this film's head . It's telling that on a second viewing , when I thought I would discover nuance and detail I missed the first time around , I was instead bored and found myself counting down the minutes until the film was over . Fellini seems to be criticizing a decadent , empty modern society in which ideas have died . Fair enough . But if he's going to make that point - - and drag it out for over three hours , no less - - perhaps he would have been wise to choose someone other than the rich , privileged class to make the point with . The grand conclusion he comes to in his film is that money , wealth and status aren't enough to give a life meaning or purpose , and don't offer anything to offset the void of boredom that they create . This isn't news . Has there ever been a time in history when the privileged classes haven't been bored ? I thought the strongest sequence in the film was that depicting the media frenzy that erupts when two children see the Madonna in an empty field . It reminded me of a news story that occurred just a few months ago here in Chicago when a similar frenzy erupted over a water stain in the shape of the Virgin Mary that formed on the wall of an Interstate overpass . Fellini beautifully caught the utter absurdity of people trying to convince themselves that what they want to believe is true , and the sadness that this need is necessary in the first place . In the film's final sequence , Marcello Mastroianni's character tells the people he's partying with that they're the most boring people alive . I second that . Too bad that a movie about boring , vacuous people makes for a boring , vacuous movie .
I Should Have Known Better Than to Mock Joe Buck	A movie I thought I'd be able to make fun of ( I just couldn't see myself taking Jon Voight seriously in the photos and brief snippets I'd seen ) and ended up liking quite a bit . Voight and Eric Roberts play escaped convicts who end up on the runaway train of the title with a female train worker ( Rebecca DeMornay ) as a kind-of hostage . It's primarily a straight-up action movie , but it pays more than usual attention to characterizations than films of its sort , and it's as good as it is thanks to the acting of Voight - - who proves himself to be quite up to the tasks of this role after all - - and Roberts , who's about as good here as he ever was in anything else .
Not the Novel , But Enjoyable on Its Own Terms	The supremely literary and ambitious novel by A . S . Byatt has been streamlined into a more conventional love story for two beautiful Hollywood actors in this screen adaptation directed by ( of all people ! ) Neil LaBute . Aaron Eckhart and Gwyneth Paltrow play scholars of a Victorian poet and poetess , respectively , who discover that their two subjects were romantically involved and find themselves in a race with rival scholars to prove it and change the face of scholarship forever . The film intercuts modern-day scenes of Eckhart and Paltrow falling cautiously in love with flashbacks to the two poets , played by Jeremy Northam and Jennifer Ehle . I found this literal and conventional approach to be the film's biggest failing , and couldn't help but think how much more interesting the film might have been if we had never seen actual reconstructions of the past and were left to visualize it along with the two scholars . However , to be fair , I don't know how that could have been done cinematically , so it seems churlish to hold the writer and director of the film to task for not doing it . Lovers of the book will undoubtedly find much to criticize in the film , as it leaves much plot and several characters out entirely , and is more interested in intrigues romantic than literary , but I thought it was decent . Eckhart is an extremely likable actor , and Paltrow is well cast , if a bit too conventionally beautiful for the role , and the two have quite a bit of chemistry . If one insists on holding the film to the same standards as the novel , it's bound to pale in comparison , but taken on its own terms , the movie is quite enjoyable .
Can't We All Just Get Along ?	I read the E . M . Forster novel between viewings of " A Passage to India , " and found that my impression of the film was somewhat diminished the second time as a result . But there's an old-fashioned splendor to David Lean's style of film-making that I love , and so I very much admire this film despite its faults . Judy Davis and Peggy Ashcroft play two English ladies , one young , one old , who travel to India in search of a true Indian adventure . While exploring the mysterious Marabar caves with a doctor who both ladies befriend ( Victor Banerjee ) , something enigmatic unhinges both of them , and the doctor is accused by Adela ( Davis ) of attempted rape . The resulting trial brings the already simmering tension between the English and Indians to an angry boil . Forster's novel is deeply complex and psychological . The film only skims the surface of the inner lives of its characters , and focuses instead on the more tangible plot points . As a result , the movie doesn't make as much sense as the book , mostly because we never fully understand Davis's character , and it's on the inner workings of her mind that the whole story hinges . But the film does successfully ask the same question as Forster's novel , which is not how can the English and Indian cultures integrate , but rather whether or not such a thing will ever be possible . " A Passage to India " does have all of the elements that immediately identify a film as being of David Lean's canon : the exotic locales , the traditional Hollywood feel , the glorious Maurice Jarre score , and even if less than in the novel , a level of character development that is frequently lacking in big-screen epics .
Parker Directs with an Iron Fist , But the Results Are Fascinating Anyway	Alan Parker's pitch-black and bizarro account of Billy Hayes , a young American who was caught trying to smuggle drugs out of Turkey and was thrown in a harsh Turkish prison , where he remained while his family fought for his release . The movie unreels like a series of outrageous indignities , each meant to top the one before until by the end all threads of reality have been lost and the whole thing is being filmed like a German Expressionist horror show . Indeed , it's all clearly meant to be horrifying , but it gets so grim that things actually start becoming funny , like a scene in which Billy's girlfriend comes to visit him and presses her bare boobs up against the panel of glass separating them for poor Billy's sex-starved gratification . Randy Quaid and John Hurt pop up as two of the loonies locked up with Billy . The whole thing is never less than fascinating even if it is crude and heavy handed .
Not the Comedy Masterpiece So Many Claim	Those who come to " Kind Hearts and Coronets " because of the reputation of Alec Guinness's performance ( or rather performances ) may find themselves disappointed in this dark comedy from Britain's Ealing studios . Not because Guinness's performance is bad , but because there's much less of it than admirers would have you believe . Guinness has nowhere nearly as much screen time as Dennis Price , who plays a vengeful family outcast who decides to murder the eight other family members standing between him and a dukeship . Though Guinness plays all eight of the doomed relatives , he doesn't get much time as any of them , and he doesn't give them the colorful characterizations I was expecting . The film is humorous at times , but quite slow and even rather boring at others . It's capped by a clever ending , but overall the movie is not the masterpiece it's been hyped up to be .
Solid If Not Groundbreaking Shakespeare Adaptation	As film adaptations of Shakespeare go , Joseph L . Mankiewicz's " Julius Caesar " is a pretty good one . In general , the stunt casting approach works , even in some of the most dubious cases ( Marlon Brando ? Greer Garson ? Louis Calhern ? ) . Brando , against all odds , makes a fine Marc Antony . I had expected to find his high-pitched mumble sound ridiculous reciting Shakespeare , but his is quite a compelling performance . However , the actor who shines the most , and who I never hear anyone talk about in relation to this film , is James Mason , giving a superbly effective performance as Brutus . He is completely at ease with the language , but unlike many of the other cast members , does not let the stately poetry do his work for him , and invests Brutus with a great deal of emotional depth . The film looks marvelous ; director Mankiewicz sends his camera prowling around sumptuously designed sets , and sheds a chilly black and white glow on the action . However , despite the mostly strong acting and terrific production design , I never really warmed to the movie , just as I rarely do to any filmed version of a Shakespeare work . There are so many wonderful stories to tell cinematically , that I just don't get the point of rehashing over and over properties that so clearly belong on the stage . Give me Mankiewicz's " All About Eve " over yet one more filmed Shakespeare play any day .
As Unfocused as the Gulf War Itself	" Jarhead " is like a " best-of " compilation film of other classic war movies . At different times , it reminded me of " Apocalypse Now , " " Full Metal Jacket , " and David O . Russell's " Three Kings , " among others . The problem is that it never achieves a style or point of view of its own . As a narrative , it's as unfocused and messy as the war it's about . However , it does manage to send you out of the theatre remembering specific images or moments , so in that way it's effective . Director Sam Mendes obviously wants us to feel the way Martin Sheen's character does in " Apocalypse " : adrift in a surreal nightmare . However , the difference between Coppola's film and this one , and what made the former successful and this one less so , is that even among the madness of Vietnam , the protagonist of " Apocalypse " had a distinct purpose . The movie was moving toward an eventual goal , which gave the chaos of the rest of the film some foundation . In " Jarhead , " it's all chaos and no apparent goal , which Mendes seems to be saying is the point of the Gulf War in general , but that doesn't necessarily make for a compelling film . It doesn't help that the characters in " Jarhead " remain virtual nonentities . They are the stock characters of any war film , easily described in one-word summaries : the " crazy " guy , the " sensitive " guy , the " jaded " guy . We really learn nothing about the central character played by Jake Gyllenhaal , and what we do learn about him is wildly inconsistent . The entire film feels vaguely critical of American military policy in the Middle East , but it never sharpens its critique into any point that has impact . This isn't the first time Mendes ( a British director ) has pointed his criticism at American values and left me wondering what point he's trying to make . David O . Russell does a much better job in " Three Kings , " because he introduces an opposing point of view to American actions . " Jarhead " is so insular , so focused on a bunch of kids that don't have any point of view , that we don't really have a point of view either . But as I said earlier , there are some very memorable sequences in this film , and even if they never really coalesce into anything of substance , taken on their own they have their own emotional impact . I particularly liked the sequence in which the soldiers are being interviewed by American media , but are coached beforehand on what they are and are not allowed to say . That's a much-needed reminder that we at home are likely never really getting the true story of what's going on in foreign lands . Other images , like a horse covered in oil , wandering through burning oil fields ; or a highway full of charred cars and bodies , everything still frozen in the exact position it was in at the moment of destruction , come close to equaling some of the images Coppola gave us in his film . America has dug itself into a hole in the Middle East , and who knows how or when we're going to be able to dig ourselves out of it . " Jarhead " wants to add yet one more dissenting voice to our country's actions , but it doesn't really have anything new to say . If its words were as good as its images , I would say it could be a terrific movie . As it is , it doesn't have the stuff to join the list of all-time great war films .
Sally Field and James Garner Make Nice	A low-key romantic comedy that pairs Sally Field with James Garner , and proves that the two actors have a great deal of chemistry together . Sally Field is a newly-divorced mom setting up house with her son . Garner is a good ' ol boy who takes a hankering to her and promises to be a positive male influence . The doofus stud of an ex-husband makes a nuisance of himself . Guess who Field winds up with ? The film rides along harmlessly enough on the personalities of its two leads . Won Oscar nominations for Garner and its cinematography .
Convinced Me	I wasn't someone who really needed to be convinced that eating fast food was bad for you , and yet Morgan Spurlock's film managed to convince me all over again . The shocking thing about this documentary is not that a diet of McDonald's turns out to be bad for you ( wow , what a surprise ! ) or fattening ( get out of town ! ) but that it actually acts like a poison to your system . Even the doctors in the film are amazed at the detrimental effects a fast food diet had on Spurlock over the course of a month . He had as much fast food in 30 days that nutritionists recommend having in 8 years . That's a cold wake up call to those who defend themselves by saying things like , " I only have it once a week or so , so I'm o . k . " Do the math - - once a week equals 52 times in a year ; at that pace , you'll eat 8 years ' worth of fast food in under two . People also claim that this film has too firm an agenda , Morgan Spurlock is too preachy , etc . , etc . I honestly don't understand these comments . Since when are documentaries allowed to be only objective in tone ? Don't these people know that some of the best documentaries in film history have had clear agendas and clear points of view . This criticism is leveled at Michael Moore too . But if the film maker isn't allowed to have a point of view , why would he be making the film in the first place ? " Super Size Me " is almost a horror movie in the effect it has on your psyche and your stomach . How anyone can watch this and continue passively to fill their bodies day after day with garbage is beyond me .
Astaire , Crosby and a Very White Christmas	Well , Astaire and Rogers weren't drawing the audiences in anymore , so who better to be a replacement for Rogers than . . . . . Bing Crosby ? Yep , it's Astaire and Crosby headlining this one , and the females in it just have to look pretty and sit back while the boys do all the work . " Holiday Inn " is a fun , mindless musical , with some senseless plot strands connecting the real reason for watching the movie - - an assemblage of song and dance numbers each centered around a national holiday . Forgive it its corniness , forgive it its maudlin WWII propaganda sequence , and especially forgive it its nauseating black face number to celebrate Lincoln's birthday , and just sit back and enjoy it the way audiences at the time were meant to . There are plenty of showstopping numbers to make up for the movie's faults , like Astaire's 4th of July tap-dance number set to exploding firecrackers , the hilarious Washington's birthday number ( though who makes a weekend out of celebrating Washington's birthday ? Best not ask questions like these ) and the comfy-cosy final scene , set to the song " White Christmas " ( which , hard to believe , was not a song before this movie ) , and which is single-handedly responsible for keeping this film remembered as a Christmas movie when really Christmas hardly plays a role . Good innocent fun .
Unfairly Maligned	Michael Cimino's " Heaven's Gate " is certainly not without its problems , but it's hard to believe , now that the historical context in which the film was released is long past , that it received such a rough drubbing when it came out 25 years ago . It's quite an interesting film and even a very well made one . It bears many similarities to Cimino's earlier success , " The Deer Hunter " : a focus on male solidarity and conflict , man returning to a more primitive state , a narrative structure that has the protagonist moving from civilization to a barbaric world and then back to a civilization that will be changed forever by preceding events . Like " The Deer Hunter , " this films deals in images more than words . Unlike " The Deer Hunter , " however , and this film's biggest failing , is the lack of a cast of the same strength that graced Cimino's earlier film . " The Deer Hunter " had Robert De Niro , Meryl Streep and Christopher Walken . " Heaven's Gate " gets Christopher Walken , but in a role for which he is ill suited , and instead of De Niro and Streep we get Kris Kristofferson and Isabelle Huppert . I don't know what possessed Cimino to think Kristofferson could carry a film of this magnitude , but it's a dire miscalculation on his part . Kristofferson isn't necessarily a horrible actor , but he's certainly not strong enough to retain an audience's interest over the course of a 219 minute film . Isabelle Huppert is bland as well . The result is long scenes with little or no dialogue , in which feelings are supposedly being expressed in the faces of the actors ; but since the actors aren't very strong , nothing is getting expressed . That's what makes " Heaven's Gate " much longer than it needs to be . There's really only a wisp of a story , so if we're not fully engaged in the characters , what exactly are we supposed to be engaged in ? However , the weak cast and writing aside , " Heaven's Gate " is still a remarkable achievement in its own way , and a much better film than a new generation of movie lovers has been led to believe . Cimino may stumble with actors , but he's got a iron-clad grasp of visuals , and puts some stunning and memorable images on the screen . The film feels much more like a 70's film than it does an 80's film . At various times , it reminded me of " Little Big Man , " " McCabe and Mrs . Miller , " and " The Wild Bunch . " If that esteemed company doesn't serve as an endorsement of this film , I don't know what does .
Well Made , But VERY Depressing	A stark , downbeat film , proof that Hollywood produced more in the late 1950s / early 1960s than just colorful Biblical spectacles and musicals . Paul Newman stars as Fast Eddie Felsen , one of the roles that made him famous and for which he would win an Oscar when he reprised it over twenty years later in Martin Scorsese's " The Color of Money . " We think of Newman as making his name playing romantic leads , but look at this body of work during this time period : " Cat on a Hot Tin Roof , " " The Hustler , " " Hud , " " Cool Hand Luke . " He actually excelled at playing renegades on the fringe , and he very often took on roles in which he was far from likable . Piper Laurie ( Oscar nominated ) plays the doomed love interest . She wouldn't appear in a film again until 1976's " Carrie , " for which she would also be nominated for an Oscar ( that has to be some sort of obscure record ) . Standout performances come from Jackie Gleason , breaking his Ralph Cramden persona to play a slick rival pool hustler , and most notably George C . Scott , as Newman's oily manager . Robert Rossen directs in the same gritty , sweaty style he brought to " All the King's Men , " a style that works well for the milieu . The movie is very good , but it's such a downer that it leaves a bad taste in the mouth when it's over .
A Surprisingly Touching Nightmare	After preparing myself for a completely inaccessible movie experience , I was surprised to find myself quite moved by a strange and sad film about the urges that drive one tortured soul . The movie makes some very interesting parallels between the urge to destructive behavior ( drink , for example ) and the urge to create art . In the surreal world of this film , these are two parts of the same instinct , and it's sad to see a man with so much creative potential simultaneously destroying himself . Director David Cronenberg gives us a bizarre , dream-like world that nevertheless has a distinct logic of its own . Peter Weller is terrific in the lead role ; this couldn't have been an easy performance to create , as he has to serve as an anchor for the audience and establish some sanity in an insane world . Judy Davis is also memorable as his love interest . It's not an easy film , but then what Cronenberg movie ever is ? It didn't leave me as cold as many of his other films , and I thought this one overcame the chilly cerebral intellectualism that ruined movies like " Dead Ringers " or " Crash " ( 1996 ) .
A Cute Performance from Westfeldt	This charming , lightweight comedy about sexual orientation and experimentation stars the adorable , funny Jennifer Westfeldt as a good Jewish girl who decides that maybe the whole heterosexual dating thing isn't working for her , so she's going to play for the other team for a while . She begins a timid " romance " with a girl in much the same boat , with the exception that Westfeldt never really takes to lesbianism and the other girl does . Though the lesson she learns - - the problem in connecting with men lies in her own inability to sustain an intimate connection with another human being , not in any hidden homosexual tendencies - - is obvious , it's well told , and the director manages to keep the film from seeming glib or trendy . Westfeldt is a lovable actress , and she navigates the iffy terrain between cute and annoying very well .
Gotta Cut Loose for Kevin Bacon	Aw , come on IMDb'ers , why the low rating ? Where's your sense of loyalty ? I can't hear that Kenny Loggins title song and see those pairs of dancing feet during the opening credits without sitting down to watch this whole movie . And even if it's largely to make fun of it , I still love it for old times ' sake . Kevin Bacon is the tough city kid stuck in some podunk Midwest town where dancing has been outlawed . John Lithgow is the preacher who serves as Bacon's arch nemesis ; Lori Singer is the preacher's daughter who has a hankering for the new dangerous kid . Dianne Wiest is the reasonable mom who acts as referee between dad and daughter . The whole thing is sillier than an episode of " Laugh-In , " but many of the actors ( particularly Lithgow , Wiest and Bacon ) are good enough to actually sell the material . And come on , admit it , you know you like the music .
A Tame Dirty Comedy	Boys behaving badly is the subject of this pretty funny adolescent comedy . Three uber-geeky high school seniors are invited to a party they otherwise would never get invited to because they promise to bring the booze . Their struggles to actually get to the party comprise most of the film's action . End of story . " Superbad " is plenty naughty , but it's actually fairly tame for the genre . Even " Porky's " from more than twenty years ago felt more adult than this movie . The film's R rating comes almost entirely from its rough language , of which there is plenty , but there's little else to offend . This comedy is in the tradition of the recent spate of " sensitive " adult comedies like " The 40-Year-Old-Virgin " and " Knocked Up " in which guys learn to treat women with respect and maturity is something other than a four-letter word . I had two major complaints with " Superbad " : one is that I can't stand the actor Jonah Hill , who unfortunately gets the bulk of the movie's screen time ; the other is that I'm also tiring quickly of Seth Rogan , and his and Bill Hader's antics as the most irresponsible cops in the world provide the movie with its least funny moments , and serve only as a distraction from the much funnier and actually sort of sweet story about three teenagers ' coming of age .
A Modern Holiday Classic	Will Ferrell has escaped the curse of most SNL veterans who try to transition to major motion pictures ( at least those who have tried to make the jump in recent years ) and manages to produce the most consistently funny films of probably any of them ( including Mike Myers ) . " Elf " is destined to be a holiday classic , one of those you watch every year around the holiday season . Ferrell , a human baby adopted by elves ( some scenes of him with his elf dad , played in a dead pan performance by Bob Newhart , provide the film with some of its funniest sight gags ) , goes off in search of his real father , a search that takes him to NYC . The joke of course is that Ferrell , wandering around the streets of New York in his elf costume and eating gum off of subway station railings , doesn't seem out of the ordinary in a place like NY , where people are used to crazies , and where every department store has a troupe of workers dressed as elves anyway . He finds his dad ( played by James Caan ) , falls in love ( with Zooey Deschanel ) and helps save Christmas when Santa's sleigh malfunctions due to a lack of Christmas spirit . It's all very funny and harmless , with a sense of humour that manages to satisfy both those who like their Christmas cheer served warm and those sarcastic cynics ( like me ) who watch " How the Grinch Stole Christmas " and root for the Grinch . Favorite line , delivered when Ferrell gets a job in the mail room of a children's book publishing house : " This reminds me of the North Pole , except that it smells like mushrooms and everyone looks like they want to hurt me . "
Surprisingly Good Relationship Drama	This solidly written and acted relationship dramedy surprised me with its adult approach to material that has been done to death elsewhere . Zach Braff attempts to shed the goofball charm that makes him such an appealing heartthrob to college-age girls who know him primarily for his work on the television show " Scrubs , " and knuckles down to play a man on the cusp of thirty who feels panic-stricken by all the life responsibilities that turning thirty implies . Things aren't helped by the fact that his girlfriend , who he's reluctant to marry , is pregnant . A stupid decision on his part threatens their relationship , and the happy Hollywood ending at least comes with enough uncertainty and bitterness to make it believable . This movie hasn't yet seemed to have found an audience , and I'm not surprised . Braff is at a funny place in his career . The twenty-somethings who like him because of " Scrubs " aren't mature enough to understand this movie - - a group of college girls behind me in the theatre did nothing but giggle through the whole thing and seemed disgruntled at the end that the whole movie was , in their words , " depressing . " But Braff isn't yet old enough to make older audiences believe he has anything to tell them about life experience . This movie is pretty much squarely aimed at people my age - - that is , people just barely on either side of 30 - - despite the presence in the film of Blythe Danner and Tom Wilkinson , playing a married couple going through a crisis of their own . This film says a lot of honest things about relationships : how both men and women are scared about committing to one another and how each gender reacts to that fear ; how we look to the examples in our lives for clues on how to deal with our own messes ; how 30-year-olds think they know it all because they know more than they did when they were 20 , yet know barely anything compared to those who are 50 and older . It's even a rather complicated film in that no one character is entirely likable or entirely unlikable . Virtually everyone in it makes some mistake at one point or another , but as the film makes crystal clear , to point a finger at someone else's mistakes means pointing a finger at your own .
Nolte and Sarandon Are the Reasons to See This One	An inspiring true-life account of a husband and wife who , out of desperation , discover a treatment for their son's disease that otherwise had been dismissed by the medical community as untreatable . This is Lifetime movie stuff , and at any number of moments the film threatens to topple over into the overly maudlin and treacly . But it mostly avoids those pitfalls thanks largely to Nick Nolte and Susan Sarandon , who play the mom and dad and who make this film worth watching . Sarandon's role is a bit more stock , that of the suffering mother . But Nolte is ferocious as a man with an obsession , literally racing the clock to save his little boy . Will probably never be considered a great film , but is at least a pretty good one .
Kathy Bates Gives a Cock a Doody Performance	Stephen King's novel had a smashing premise that the film only partially succeeds in capitalizing on . It's clear that " Misery " is an author's ( or at least King's ) worst nightmare : a writer of disposable potboilers ( James Caan ) is in an accident and finds himself convalescing in the home of his self-proclaimed # 1 fan ( Kathy Bates ) . Trouble is , his # 1 fan is holding him hostage , and does nasty things to him if he doesn't write exactly what she wants him to . Some of those things are diluted for the film ( in the book , she chops off one of his feet , whereas in the movie she only hobbles him with a sledgehammer ) and some missing altogether ( the finger in the birthday cake for instance ) . But it's not the gore that made the book scary - - it was the helplessness of the main character , and director Rob Reiner is right to focus on that in the film as well . Kathy Bates is appropriately wacky as Annie , but she's a wonderful actress who's done a bunch of much better work elsewhere , so it's sort of a shame that this is the film for which she won her Oscar . Caan is good too , but he's shown up by Bates - - anyone would be shown up by this loony-tunes character . It's only toward the end that Reiner trips up , and the film goes lame , veering away from the book . However , in the film's defense , the ending to the book was pretty lame too , so Reiner was probably right to try to do something different , even if that something doesn't really work .
Unambitious Hitchcock , But a Good Time	" The Man Who Knew Too Much " falls into that Hitchcock middle ground that characterized many of his films during the 1950s : not a masterpiece of suspense by any means , but an awful lot of fun nonetheless . James Stewart and Doris Day play a vacationing couple who get caught up in a plot heavy on foreign intrigue . The famous climactic scene takes place at a classical music concert , where someone is going to be assassinated during a particular cymbal clash in the score . The impish Hitchcock of course lets us know what that point is , so that the race to stop the assassin becomes a nail biting race against the cymbalist . So much of this movie reminded me of the 1978 Chevy Chase / Goldie Hawn comedy " Foul Play " that I have to believe that film was inspired by this . Neither film is a big deal , but both are easy to enjoy .
Imagine There's No Heaven , Just People Loving One Another Here on Earth	A fresh breeze sweeping away the cloud of gloom that has descended on Hollywood this fall , " Across the Universe " is a nice antidote to all of those grimy , dour films currently filling movie theatres . The point of all of those seems to be that we live in a crappy world . The point of " Across the Universe " is that sure , things may be crappy now , but they've been crappy before , and as long as the important things - - like love - - remain , the world we live in can always get better . A simplistic message ? Perhaps . But no less welcome for that . Stage veteran Julie Taymor , most known for her revolutionary staging of the Broadway musical " The Lion King , " sets her movie in the turbulent 60s , when anti-Vietnam sentiments and racial discord were reaching a boiling point , but there's no doubt that the criticism of American foreign policy is aimed squarely at the leadership of today who currently have us embroiled in another potential Vietnam , Iraq . The movie unfolds in bursts of song and color ( the score is comprised completely of Beatles tunes ) , and even though the movie is far too long given its wisp of a plot , it mostly manages to sustain an infectious energy . The Beatles songs mostly sound great , and they're used creatively . I already knew I liked the Beatles , but hearing their songs performed here in a different context reawakened an appreciation for them . " I Want to Hold Your Hand , " for example , originally a perky pop anthem , becomes here a heartbreaking ballad performed by a young girl in love whose object of affection doesn't return the favor . " Come Together " plays over a dazzling montage juxtaposing New York's Wall Street elite ( represented by a troupe of suited business men dancing in unison ) to its disenfranchised . And " Let It Be " becomes a gospel anthem underscoring the Detroit riots . Other songs fare less well , like " Strawberry Fields Forever , " which feels awkwardly shoe-horned into the film . The young cast of mostly unknowns is attractive and engaging , even if the film doesn't demand much from them . The standout for me was Dana Fuchs , playing a singer obviously modeled after Janis Joplin .
Oh , Those Corleones . . . .	No American filmmaker has had a more disappointing trajectory to his film career than Francis Ford Coppola . To have directed four of the most influential films of the 70's ( the first two " Godfather " films , " The Conversation , " and " Apocalypse Now " ) and then to spend the last two decades churning out one stinky product after another ( " Peggy Sue Got Married , " " Bram Stoker's Dracula " , the third " Godfather " ) earns Coppola my award for Most Promising Director Who Most Miserably Failed at Establishing Himself as an Important Figure of American Cinema . But before " Jack " there was " The Godfather . " While I feel the whole " Godfather " trilogy has been lauded into oblivion and is somewhat overrated , who am I to argue with the majority ? People think these are great movies , and they've certainly implanted themselves permanently in our cultural consciousness . And don't get me wrong : these films have moments of greatness ( at least the first two installments do ) . But I think " The Conversation " and " Apocalypse Now " are ultimately more interesting films , and I think Coppola stretched himself more artistically in those two films than he did in the entire " Godfather " trilogy combined . Of the trilogy , the first film is by far the best . It shows Coppola's flair for being able to craft a story with extreme mainstream appeal while staying faithful to his artistic vision . " The Godfather " doesn't look or sound quite like any gangster film before it , with it's muddy lighting and sound . It's also much more ambiguous morally than the usual Hollywood gangster film , at least any produced up to that point . The line between crime and justice is blurred sometimes beyond distinction , and the Corleone family at times acts with more honor ( in its own way ) than the institutions charged with upholding freedom , justice and morality . In this way , " The Godfather " offered a scathing critique of the foundations on which America as a country was built . Coppola , however , drives this point into the ground over the course of three films . There's really not much more to say after the first film ( it's already apparent that Michael Corleone's style of rule is different from his father's , his coldness and ruthlessness necessitated by a changing time ) , but we have to sit through a nearly 3 hour second installment that does nothing but reiterate this point again and again . Part II at least is saved by the back story of Vito Corleone ( played by Marlon Brando in Part I and Robert De Niro in Part II ) , and that story alone keeps Part II afloat . But Part III is wholly unnecessary and mars the whole enterprise , turning the franchise into the stuff of parody and camp . Al Pacino is the glue that holds the trilogy together , though his character really isn't as complex as a first viewing would have you believe . The major conflict facing him is resolved in the first film , and the second and third films give him nothing to do but replay what are essentially the same scenes over and over again . Other standouts in the cast include Robert Duvall , Diane Keaton and Talia Shire ( who alone makes the third chapter worth watching ) . Obviously a must see for cinema buffs , or even casual fans , but don't feel you have to label this trilogy as great just because of the reputation that precedes it . Grade : Part I : A Part II : B Part III :
Repellant Protagonist in a Cynical Crime Film	In " Shakedown , " Howard Duff plays a photographer who will stop at nothing to climb his way to the very top of the success ladder . On the strength of his sheer tenacity , he gets a job with a major newspaper , and it's not long before he's made a name for himself by charming a notorious crime boss ( Brian Donlevy ) into allowing himself to be photographed . Donlevy takes him under his wing , but Duff decides to bite the hand that feeds him and sets Donlevy and another crime boss , Lawrence Tierney , against one another . He uses photos to blackmail Tierney into providing him with a steady income while he sidles up to Donlevy's wife on the sly , all the while romancing the photo editor of the paper at which he works . But Duff's cockiness and confidence in his own cleverness get the best of him , and he meets his end in a wildly melodramatic finale in which he snaps one last photo , that of his own murderer , before dying . " Shakedown " is notable for its highly suggestive dialogue and sexual content , and for the sheer repulsiveness of its protagonist . Duff's character is unapologetically repellant - - he has no moral qualms whatsoever about anything he does , even if people get killed as a direct result of his actions . The film is probably about ten minutes too long , and over all is a minor work , but it should be seen as an example of post-war cinema at its harshest and most cynical .
A Thinking Man's Pot-Boiler	" The Illusionist " is a nifty but rather strange film . It's a mystery whose central mystery , once revealed , isn't all that mysterious , yet the film manages to build an exciting amount of suspense anyway . It's success , I think , lies in the fact that it builds a great deal of character development and character-driven subplots into the film , so that not everything hinges on how tricky you find the ending to be . As Paul Giamatti's police inspector character begins to connect the pieces of the puzzle in the film's climactic moments , it's more fun to watch his face responding to the trick than it is to see how the trick was pulled off in the first place . Edward Norton , as usual , does a fine job as master magician Eisenheim , who meets his long-lost childhood love ( Jessica Biel ) ten years after they were parted and told they could never be together , due to class differences . From there , it's up to Eisenheim to pull off his most elaborate illusion yet , and make them " disappear , " as his young love asks him to do early in the film . But where does reality end and illusion begin ? The film plays with that question in what is mostly pot-boiler fashion while giving it just enough intellectual trimmings ( talk about the soul , etc . ) to satisfy those who want a little meat with their thrillers . And Philip Glass provides a musical score that sounds for all the world like the one he composed for " The Hours , " though what worked so well for that movie feels less suited for the material here .
Moore Documentary Is Entertaining as Always , But Leaves a Lot Unanswered	Michael Moore's documentaries are always compulsively entertaining , but they also always leave me feeling miserable about being an American . " Sicko " is about the sorry state of our health insurance industry , and it forces us to face some very uncomfortable truths . However , what I frequently DON'T like about Moore's films , and " Sicko " is guilty of this as well , is that Moore does a lot of complaining without offering solutions . He spends two hours telling us that countries like England , France and even Cuba take better care of their citizens than the U . S . , but I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do with that information . His film creates frustration and anger but then doesn't give us any outlets for those feelings . Moore claims that he loves American and is a fervent patriot , but the message that comes across loudest from " Sicko " is a resounding " America Sucks ! " Moore's greatest failing in this documentary is to ignore the responsibility Americans have to take control of their own health . Everyone in his movie is a victim of the insurance industry ; the greatest defense Americans can take against becoming ensnared in the quagmire is preventive health care , but Moore doesn't address that . Americans need to stop eating fast food , they need to stop smoking . They need to stop the fad diets and lose weight the right away , through exercise and sensible food choices . They need to get out and walk places instead of driving everywhere . American corporations aren't ever going to change their practices because of whining filmmakers . Actions are always going to speak louder than words .
So This Is What Altman Thinks of Hollywood	Leave it to Robert Altman to announce his return to Hollywood with a scathing indictment of it . After a decade of working in virtual anonymity , Altman made a comeback with this dark comedy , scoring his third Academy Award nomination as director and his first since " Nashville " nearly 20 years earlier . It's instantly recognizable as an Altman film - - the opening of the movie is an 8-minute tracking shot following various conversations about either story ideas or movies in general , including one about famous tracking shots from famous movies . Tim Robbins plays a self-absorbed producer who begins to receive death threats from an unknown writer whose idea Robbins ignored . As he becomes increasingly paranoid , the movie becomes increasingly like a nightmare , and the world of Hollywood begins to become more and more removed from the world of everyone else . Altman vents his frustration and disdain for the asinine business of making movies , even while he suggests that the business is worth putting up with in order to do what he loves . Pretty much everyone who had ever been in an Altman film to that point in time ( and many who hadn't ) have roles in this movie , some - - Peter Gallagher , Sydney Pollack , Vincent D'Onofrio , Whoopi Goldberg ( hilarious ) - - playing fictional characters while others - - too many to name - - play themselves . Robbins anchors the film though , with a great performance completely lacking in vanity . Only Altman would choose to do a full frontal male nude scene with the actor caked in mud . " The Player " is not actually one of my favorite Altman films , but it did signal his return to his typical large-scale ensemble format , and it allowed him to make " Short Cuts , " which IS one of my favorites , the very next year .
Terrific Ensemble in a Provocative Conversation Starter	My wife and I launched immediately into a conversation about this film before the end credits had even finished rolling . It's the kind of film that makes you want to apply some of its ideas and themes to your own life and experiences . At first I was worried . When the film began , I thought it was going to be an episodic experimental piece , with 13 different scenes each dealing with an aspect of happiness . This bothered me , because the first segment of the film left me wanting more of the same story and I would have been disappointed if the screenplay had never come back to it . However , the first few segments that seem at first to be unrelated begin to mesh in a fluid way ( but never in a way that feels forced ) , and what happens in one begins to illuminate the actions and feelings in another . Because of it's episodic nature , the actors don't get a lot of room to flesh out their characters , but the performances are still strong . Alan Arkin is especially good ( he always is ) . This one comes highly recommended .
Someone Get That Woman a Comb !	One senses that James Whale's 1931 " Frankenstein " became a classic almost by accident . Its poignancy and artistry have lasted despite its attempts at being a throw-away monster movie . " Bride of Frankenstein , " however , feels like a movie setting out to become a high-camp classic , and it's to Whale's credit that it succeeds . If you don't live under a rock , the image of Elsa Lanchester , with her tower of black hair sticking straight up off of her head with a white lightning bolt zig-zagging down the sides , has to be familiar to you , even if you've never seen the movie . Her appearance in this was destined to be cloned by millions of Halloween costume-party goers for years afterwards . The hilarious romance between her and the monster takes center stage in this film , and Lanchester is a hoot as a hot-tempered woman impatient with her " primitive " male . It's the most unusual role Lanchester ever had . She normally played in supporting roles , usually as a demure maid or housekeeper . Here she vamps it up and manages to be surprisingly sexy for a woman newly created from dead people's body parts . If you're in the mood for a double feature , let " Frankenstein " make you sad and then let " Bride of Frankenstein " put a smile back on your face .
Terrence Stamp Delivers Creepy Performance in Deeply Unsettling Film	This intensely creepy film showcases director William Wyler in his intimate , character-study mode , and features a superb performance from Terrence Stamp in the title role , as the " collector " of beauty . Stamp creates a portrait of sexual obsession that is every bit as unsettling in its way as the long legacy of serial killer movies in existence . Samantha Eggar , as one of Stamp's " specimens , " is used more as a catalyst for driving the plot and less as a character for whom we have any great deal of interest . Is that a flaw of the material or the intention of Wyler and novelist John Fowles , on whose book this is based ? If their intention was to make us sympathize with , and even relate to , the character with the obsession , they succeed brilliantly . The ending genuinely surprised me , which happens all too infrequently in movies like this . The film feels like a product of independent cinema before independent cinema really existed .
Hard-Core Pre-Code Film Is a Shocker	This pre-Code melodrama is terse and blunt , and it also happens to be one of the most shocking of the pre-Code films I've seen . Ann Dvorak , Joan Blondell and Bette Davis play three friends who meet ten years after having attended school together . Dvorak is a society woman who's itching for something more exciting than the dutiful husband ( Warren William ) and young son she has , and falls in with a gang of druggies and kidnappers . Blondell is the take charge spitfire who decides to intervene and save Dvorak's son from her destructive behavior ; she happens also to fall for Dvorak's husband in the process . Dvorak gives a harrowing and blistering performance as a woman who is driven literally insane by drug use , and the film's most shocking content occurs in the scenes that show her wasting away in the drug den , ravaged by cocaine . Blondell is typically cute and sassy . The young Davis might as well not be in the film at all , and only exists so that the title can make sense . The whole thing rushes like a steamroller to a slam-bang climax that will have your jaw on the floor . Like many Warners films from this time period , that movie pretends to be a sobering moral sermon while it's really just an exploitative bit of sensationalism , but whatever its intentions , it's a firecracker of a movie . With an appearance by a very young Humphrey Bogart .
A Well Acted , Sober Film About Unpleasant Responsibilities	Don't let the fact that the DVD cover makes this movie look like gay porn keep you from seeing it . Director Hal Ashby made a string of unfussy but very , very good films throughout the 1970s , and " The Last Detail " is one them . The story doesn't sound like much : two Navy officers are assigned to escort a third to the prison where he will be serving time . Along the way , the requisite male bonding ensues , and the older , jaded officer ( Jack Nicholson ) has a chance to reflect upon his own fortune and misfortune and be a sort of father figure , for better or worse , to his young and troubled charge ( played extremely well by Randy Quaid ) . Like all of Ashby's films , " The Last Detail " challenges things like duty and institutional authority , which made Ashby one of the most vocal of the anti-establishment directors from a volatile period of American history . But also like all of his films , it poses challenges in a low-key , non-confrontational way , without sacrificing its bite . Well done .
A Polar Bear Fell on Me	Meet Dalton , bad-ass bouncer in a redneck joint . He's got a past he's running away from , when he's not busy practicing Tai Chi in his back yard , humping women up against fireplaces and strutting around in pleated pants . And in case you think Dalton is too little to be a good bouncer , just wait until you see him rip a guy's throat out with his bare hand . " Road House " is everything a bad movie should be , and it's a hell of a lot more entertaining than a lot of legitimately " good " films . As I'm writing this comment , we're heading toward the 2008 Academy Awards , and if I had a choice between watching this movie again or any of this year's Best Picture nominees , which one do you think I'd pick ? " Road House " gets so progressively bizarre that it almost becomes good . Well , o . k . not good , maybe , but definitely fascinating . You can't tear your eyes away from the screen for fear you'll miss something classic . Do yourself a favor and don't watch the special feature on the DVD that shows Patrick Swayze and other cast members talking about the film . It's too obvious that even they thought it was over the top and a bit embarrassing , which harms its good bad movie vibe . It's no fun to watch a bad movie when the people in it KNOW it's a bad movie . I would , however , recommend watching the special feature called " What Would Dalton Do ? " , in which a bunch of real-life bouncers talk about the character like he's a real person who they idolize . Did they not realize that Patrick Swayze was an actor and that " Road House " was not a documentary ?
Early Soderbergh Movie Anticipated the Indie Boom of the 90s	Steven Soderbergh has turned into one of the most schizophrenic directors alive , able to follow up gritty films like " Traffic " with glossy and frivolous Hollywood fare like the " Ocean's Eleven " series . " Sex , Lies and Videotape " is one of his early efforts before anyone really knew who he was , and it's an excellent character study with erotic thriller overtones . It features second-tier stars giving great performances , and it's got that indie vibe that began to take hold late in the 1980s and would evolve into the full-fledged indie movement of the 90s .
Sigourney Weaver Fed My Childhood Fantasies	A special effects comedy extravaganza brought to you largely by members of " Saturday Night Live . " There are two things I remember most about this movie . One of them is Sigourney Weaver , who's smoking hot and is a far cry from the butch role she played in " Alien " and for which at the time she was probably most well known . The other is Rick Moranis , who is hysterical as a possessed geek and runs around stealing the movie right out from everyone else in it . Bill Murray is his droll self , the special effects hold up well even now , and how can you not like that theme song ?
Funniest Movie of 2008 ?	I always find movies and actors that are willing to lampoon themselves and their own business to be a breath of fresh air , and " Tropic Thunder " is nothing but Hollywood lampooning itself . If you've found this comment , you likely already know what this movie is about , so there's no need for a summary from me . I'll just say that I thought it was very funny , and proof that Hollywood is capable of making a comedy that can be enjoyed by adults . The principal male cast gels wonderfully , even if Robert Downey Jr . completely steals the show as a dude dressed up as a dude playing another dude , with even the big name actors in cameos ( I'm talking to you , Tom Cruise ) doing their material justice . If Hollywood is going to insist on making disposable formula films , at least it's a comfort to know that IT knows that it's making disposable formula films . Nothing would be more depressing than to think that Hollywood is giving us movies like the one being made fun of in " Tropic Thunder " in all seriousness .
One of the Blackest Films Noir I've Ever Seen	" Detour " has to be one of the most fatalistic films noir ever made . Laughably short ( at 67 minutes ) , this nightmare film chronicles one man's bad day carried out to epic proportions . Tom Neal plays Al Roberts , hitchhiking across the country to join his girlfriend in L . A . , who's set out to make a name for herself in Hollywood . He's picked up by a shady character named Charles Haskell , who inexplicably dies one night while Al is driving the car . Certain that no one will believe this bizarre story and will suspect him of killing Haskell , Al assumes his identity with plans to ditch the car in L . A . But he picks up Vera ( Ann Savage ) , whom Haskell had given a ride earlier . Vera knows Al is up to something , and blackmails Al into joining her own money-grubbing schemes . These two hole up in an L . A . hotel , and what ensues is a domestic drama from hell . Ann Savage is nearly unwatchable as the repulsive Vera . She spits out each line like a snake spitting venom , and her harsh , angular features complement her abrasive personality . Tom Neal is effective as the dopey iconic film noir anti-hero , bullied by the femme fatale into doing whatever she wants , blaming the heavy hand of fate for his ill fortune . Is it a coincidence that a movie released in 1945 , the year in which service men would be returning home to an uncertain home life , with both husbands and wives suspicious of each other's extra-curricular activities while they were parted , would paint such a demonic picture of domestic life ? And how interesting ( and hopeless ) that everyone who comes across Al's path dies - - even Vera , whose manner of death I won't divulge so as not to spoil it - - was suffering from some unnamed illness , the implication being that she was not long for the world anyway . So essentially the entire trajectory of Al's downward spiral is pointless from the start . A far cry from the morale-building films that had glutted the marketplace for the last few years . " Detour " seems to take place in a slightly alternate universe . Everything feels just a little off , with the feverish quality that comes from being too close to the inner workings of one man's obsessive thoughts . The America pictured here is barren and deserted ; it's a world of empty roads , lonely filling stations and flea-bag diners in the middle of nowhere . The film was so cheaply made that the film stock and sound quality actually change throughout the picture . But these rough edges only enhance the movie's lurid appeal .
Another Wonderfully Inventive Film from Jacques Tourneur	Jacques Tourneur used his vast reserves of creativity to turn small-budget films into fascinating movie-going experiences . If " Out of the Past " is one of the best films noir to be released in the 1940s , then " Nightfall " must be one of the best from the succeeding decade . Aldo Ray plays James Vanning , who , with his doctor friend Edward Gurston ( Frank Albertson ) , finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time and ends up knowing the whereabouts of a bag of stolen money , wanted mightily by two bank robbers ( one played with droll relish by Brian Keith ) . Fate , always a principal character in any film noir , brings James together with Marie Gardner ( an impossibly young Anne Bancroft ) , a fashion model who becomes his girl Friday . Meanwhile , an insurance investigator ( James Gregory ) working on behalf of the robbed bank has James's number and comes calling . All of these characters finally collide in a memorable and rather grisly ending . " Nightfall " is tremendously stylish and playful . It very much resembles Tourneur's earlier noir , " Out of the Past , " in its thesis that a man can run but never hide from his past . But it also reminded me of " On Dangerous Ground , " Nicholas Ray's strange offering from 1952 , in its juxtaposition of a shadow-filled urban environment filled with anonymous ( and perhaps dangerous ) strangers with the wide open ( and no less frightening ) spaces of the country , where anything can happen and no one will know . I don't know if Aldo Ray was considered a good actor at the time , but he does a terrific job here - - who better to play an American everyman caught up in a sticky web than this all-American jock of an actor ? He and Bancroft sizzle in their scenes together , and one of the movie's highlights comes when they are racing away from one of Bancroft's fashion shows with the bad guys in hot pursuit , and Ray , frustrated by the fact that Bancroft can't run in the impractical gown she was just modeling , picks her up and runs with her into the safety of a cab , after which she leans against him and says , " You're the most wanted man I know . " This scene and line got laughs and applause at the screening I attended , but you could tell that people were laughing with the film and not at it . This film is one of the highlights of the noir genre , and I highly recommend catching it if you get a chance .
Watch It for the Camera Work	What happened to movies in the late 30's and early 40's ? Why did they become so stale and stagey ? " Dr . Jekyll and Mr . Hyde " would be considered downright antique to many of today's casual filmgoers , but it feels so much more dynamic technically and thematically than many films that came out later in its decade . The answer , of course , is that this movie came out before enforcement of the Production Code , at which time artistry in films - - both style and substance - - took a nose dive . This film is worth watching for its stunning camera work alone . It doesn't suffer from any of the awkwardness other films working in the early years of sound do . The camera's always moving , there's terrific use of light and shadow , and the scenes showing the transformation of Jekyll to Hyde are seamlessly filmed in what appear to be uninterrupted shots , leaving you to ponder the sheer physical behind-the-scenes mechanics of them . But this movie isn't just more technically advanced than films later in the decade ; it's more adult in content too . No filming of this story ten years later ( I've not seen the Victor Fleming version for comparison ) would dare add the level of sexuality that this story does . Fredric March is very good in the dual role , and when he transforms into Mr . Hyde , you can see that it's everything within his power not to rip the dress right off whatever female he happens to be with and mount her right there . I'm not exaggerating ; the film is really that frank . Creepy good fun .
One of the Best Casts Ever Assembled for a Movie	This very funny murder mystery spoof is a hoot , and the kind of movie you want to own so that you can pop it in whenever you're in the mood for something lighthearted and reliable . A mad genius millionaire ( played by Truman Capote , of all people ) gathers the world's five best detectives to his spooky house over a weekend and challenges them with a murder he doesn't believe anyone can solve . An insanely impressive cast provide dead-pan comic caricatures of some of the most iconic characters out of crime / mystery fiction . David Niven and Maggie Smith are Dick and Dora Charleston , stepping in for William Powell and Myrna Loy . Peter Sellers is Sidney Wang , not to be confused with Charlie Chan . James Coco is Milo Perrier , a grumpier and much hungrier version of Hercule Poirot . Elsa Lanchester is Jessica Marbles , a dead ringer for Miss Marple . And , best of all , Peter Falk is Sam Diamond , snatched right out of a 1940s film noir , who sleeps in his trench coat and fedora . In addition to these crack comedians , the film features Eileen Brennan as Sam Diamond's girl Friday ; Estelle Winwood , absolutely hilarious without doing anything as Jessica Marbles ' 80-something year-old nurse ; James Cromwell , who dons a priceless French accent and at one point mesh pajamas as Perrier's chauffeur ; and Nancy Walker , as the deaf and dumb cook who doesn't do any cooking . To top it all off , there's Alec Guinness , as the blind butler , who threatens to steal the show away from everyone , no small feat given who he's up against . A very silly , very fun , very enjoyable movie .
Boys Will Be Boys But Girls Get Divorced	Undaunted by the new technology of sound , Norma Shearer acts up a storm in this pre-code " women's film " about a society woman whose husband goes philandering , and decides to retaliate by doing some philandering of her own . The philandering husband is played by Chester Morris , while Robert Montgomery plays his best friend and Shearer's fling . The movie points to the hypocrisy in marital expectations that expects wives to look the other way when their boys are being boys , but entitles husbands to toss their wives aside when they do the same . Everything of course ties up nicely and happily for the couple , and in a way that would never happen in real life . But it's a lot more frank and honest than countless films on the same topic that would be released over the succeeding decade , when the production code wouldn't let filmmakers even acknowledge the existence of things like affairs and divorce . Shearer won her Academy Award for this film , and just try to take your eyes off of her whenever she's on screen .
This Wild West Belongs to Christian Bale and Russell Crowe	I went into " 3 : 10 to Yuma " with fairly low expectations , given James Mangold's track record as a mediocre director and the fact that I'm not necessarily a fan of westerns . How pleasantly surprised I was , then , to find that this particular western is slick and supremely entertaining . " 3 : 10 to Yuma " has all the trappings of the traditional western - - outlaws , humble ranchers , gunslingers , salty old-timers , buxom saloon barmaids - - but Russell Crowe and Christian Bale , the outlaw and humble rancher , respectively , bring a contemporary sensibility to the material that feels integrated rather than incongruous . Bale's rancher , Dan Evans , is suffering from feelings of male inadequacy as a result of being on the brink of losing his farm to debt ( he's already lost a leg to the Civil War ) . For two hundred dollars , he joins a group of upright townies who are escorting Ben Wade , vicious bad guy ( Crowe ) , to the train that will take him to Yuma prison . But Wade's loyal band , led by Charlie Price ( Ben Foster as the film's one weak link , giving a grating performance ) , won't let Wade go without a fight . Through clever writing and wonderful performances by Bale and Crowe , the two men almost become allies in making sure Wade gets to the train on time . Wade is so impressed with Evans ' integrity , even though he doesn't understand it , that he almost wants to see Evans succeed , even if that means he himself goes to jail . It's really a fascinating relationship , and it's that element of the film that makes it more than just a standard genre exercise . The last quarter of the film is a nailbiter ; Mangold falls back on that old reliable convention that westerns practically invented , the real time show down , with clocks placed here and there keeping time for the audience , and he does it well . The film belongs to Bale and Crowe , but there's strong acting throughout by the rest of the cast , notably Gretchen Mol in a few brief scenes as Evans ' wife and Peter Fonda as the requisite crusty old-timer .
Girl Power in the Deep South	A heartwarming female bonding movie that has all the elements of a good ol ' Southern yarn . It was a good thing that Kathy Bates made this movie so soon after " Misery . " She had made such an impression as a psycho in the earlier film that she might have had trouble getting herself out from under the mantle of Annie Wilkes . But she plays a completely different character here , a dowdy , bored housewife who befriends a little old lady forgotten in a retirement home ( Jessica Tandy ) . Tandy begins to tell her the story of a female relative , Idgie Threadgoode , and her deep friendship with Ruth , which is played out in flashback by Mary Stuart Masterson and Mary-Louise Parker . The story is one of those melodramatic , life-affirming ones , but it's acted extremely well by the four women , and the film mostly avoids the treacle that threatens to come pouring in around the edges .
Whimsical and Lovable	A warm and touching drama from visionary director Terry Gilliam , with just the right amount of magical whimsy to make it unique without being cloying . Jeff Bridges and Robin Williams give wonderful performances as a shock-jock radio DJ and the homeless vagrant with whom he strikes up a friendship . Williams , allowed to be outrageous and goofy , received much of the attention , but the film relies on Bridges , whose performance is quieter and less showy but all the more impressive for that . Mercedes Ruehl and Amanda Plummer take on the supporting female roles , and Plummer in particular gives a delightfully kooky performance . The film manages to be eccentric without being in love with its own eccentricity , a characteristic I attribute to the way it's directed .
" Springtime for Hitler " Ain't the Only Show with Singing Nazis	" The Sound of Music " is easy to ridicule . It's sappy , corny and sentimental to the extreme . It hopelessly simplifies horrible world events , and makes it seem like all anyone needed to do to escape the iron fist of Hitler's regime was to schlep over some hills on a bright , sunny morning and say " hello " to Switzerland . But I'm still recommending this movie , because it is one of the most accomplished movie musicals ever made . Robert Wise knew how to make a stage musical feel cinematic on the screen , as evidenced here and by his earlier " West Side Story . " He could open up stage musicals so that they felt right at home on screen , and he was expert at using on-location photography to enhance material rather than highlight its limitations . In " Music , " the Austrian scenery is dazzling , and nearly becomes a character in itself . And the music sounds great , though it's not one of Rodger's & Hammerstein's best scores ( it falls well below " The King and I " and " Carousel . " ) Julie Andrews is perfect in the lead role ; I can't imagine anyone else playing Maria . She had a knack for toning down overly-sentimental material until it almost became believable . And Eleanor Parker is the other stand out in the cast as the hilarious Baroness Schrader . My favorite moment comes when the family has burst into song for the umpteenth time and she leans over to Max ( Richard Haydn ) and whispers sarcastically , " Why didn't you tell me to bring along my harmonica ? " I forgive anyone who thinks this movie is just too gag-inducing to bear , but I still get some pleasure from popping it in every now and then .
It Took Me a While to come Around . . . .	Ah , " Casablanca . " Is there a line from the film that hasn't become a cliché ? That's not a criticism of the movie . If anything it's the reverse . What greater compliment to a film screenplay can a film audience make than so completely absorbing every word of it into its common cultural consciousness ? It took me a long time and multiple viewings before I warmed up to Michael Curtiz's 1943 film ( by some accounts a 1942 release ) . I'm not particularly a fan of either Ingrid Bergman or Humphrey Bogart , and the film-making techniques didn't strike me as anything inventive or unique and they still don't . At best , " Casablanca " exists as an example of the classic Hollywood style of film-making working at its slickest and most polished . But then on about the fourth viewing , it struck me . The people who love this movie don't love it for the striking visuals or the daring narrative or any of the elements that make , say , " Citizen Kane " such continual fuel for film discussion . People still love " Casablanca " for coming out at exactly the right moment in our cultural history , and somehow it's retained that " right place , right time " allure . America had been involved in World War II for at least two years by the time of this film's wide release , and many women had seen their men leave to face uncertain futures . So no wonder a film with such an intense nostalgic glow about it would strike a universal chord . No wonder the forbidden romance between the Bergman and Bogart characters seemed so intensely poignant . And no wonder the patriotic , " do whatever you must for the good of the cause " propaganda ( for let's call it what it is ) , seemed so stirring ( and still does ) . Is " Casablanca " a great film ? I won't attempt to answer that , though it's not one of my personal favorites . But any film that carries its legacy with it the way this one does can't be completely dismissed either . My grade :
Oh What a Beautiful Morning in Baltimore	At last , someone has made a good modern movie musical ! Though ironically , " Hairspray " is good precisely because it's old fashioned . This film , based on the hit Broadway musical that was in turn based on the 1988 John Waters movie ( now we need a non-musical stage play based on the film musical . . . ) , reminded me of the screen musicals produced back in the heyday of Broadway to film adaptations : films like " The Music Man , " " My Fair Lady " and " Oliver ! " that knew enough not to mess around with an already good thing . No one felt the need then to justify film musicals ; characters simply burst into song because that's what characters do in musicals . " Hairspray " is like that - - the songs are not staged as dream sequences like they were in " Chicago , " and they're not part of a stage performance like many of the songs in the woeful " Dreamgirls . " They're just good , solid Broadway songs performed with a ton of energy and verve by a talented and charismatic cast . That cast is largely responsible for making this film the exhilarating success that it is , and the fact that the casting is unpredictable and strange makes it all the more thrilling that it works . Newcomer Nikki Blonsky makes a perfect Tracy Turnblad , the chubby , optimistic teenager who wants more than anything to appear on the Corny Collins Show , a teeny bopper dance television series run by evil ice-queen Velma Von Tussel ( Michelle Pfeiffer ) . Tracy's mom , Edna ( John Travolta in drag , buried underneath heaps of prosthethic cellulite and a hilariously garbled Baltimore accent ) , doesn't want Tracy to expose herself to the ridicule she fears lurks outside in the big cruel world . But Tracy wins support from her dad , Wilbur ( played smartly by Christopher Walken ) , her best friend Penny Pingleton ( the adorable Amanda Bynes ) and the town's black citizenship , namely Motormouth Maybelle ( Queen Latifah ) and her son , Seaweed ( Elijah Kelly ) , who see in Tracy's challenge to the imperious T . V . station a parallel to their own racial struggles . Every single member of the cast has boatloads of chemistry with all the others : Blonsky and Travolta , who perform " Welcome to the 60s " as an anthem to the beauty that can be found in being unconventional ; Travolta and Walken , who stop the show with one of the film's best numbers , the big-band infused " You're Timeless to Me " ; Bynes and Kelly , who explore the touchy terrain of interracial dating ; Queen Latifah with everybody she comes in contact with . Only Pfeiffer comes across as distant , which is a fault I've always found with her as an actress , but which happens to suit this particular role . And Allison Janney makes an hilarious impression in the film's smallest role as Penny's hyper-religious and over-protective mom . For all of " Hairspray's " ding-bat zaniness and froth , it manages to deliver a powerful message about progressiveness and tolerance , and handles its civil rights background action far better than last year's civil-rights-set musical , the far more serious but disastrously terrible " Dreamgirls . " " Hairspray " has a gigantic heart , and it put a smile on my face that lasted long after I left the movie theatre . What a nice change of pace from the usual bang-'em-up , smash-'em-up offerings of summer .
A Grisly , Sickly Entertaining Film	A brutally bleak screen adaptation of the pulpy Horace McCoy novella , about a Depression-era dance marathon where down-and-outers drive themselves to the brink of exhaustion to win the cash prize . This film has become relevant again today in the age of reality T . V . , where people tune in to watch strangers be humiliated , rejected and made fun of . Meanness and suffering sells today , and apparently it sold back then as well . The M . C . of the dance marathon , played wonderfully by Gig Young in one of his last ( if not the last ) film performances before the troubled actor murdered his wife and then killed himself , creates little narratives and dramas around each of the dancers , so that the audience can have their favorites to root for . Every once in a while , someone will show off a special talent , singing a song or hoofing a little dance number , and the audience will throw change at them , which the performer then frantically scrabbles up like a desperate pigeon . The cast of dancers is led by Jane Fonda , in a break-out role as Gloria , the jaded woman-of-the-world who's seen it all and doesn't want to see anymore ; Susannah York , as a pretentious wannabe actress , who acts up a storm during a mesmerizing breakdown scene ; Red Buttons , as an aging ex-serviceman who struggles to keep up with the young kids around him ; and Bruce Dern and Bonnie Bedelia , as a sweet couple of country bumpkins who are desperate to win the cash for their unborn baby . And yes , that is Al Lewis ( aka Grandpa Munster ) lurking around in the background as one of the dance marathon officials . Director Sydney Pollack vastly improves on the source material , making something much richer and deeper out of McCoy's lurid novella . He uses an edgy , jarring style that's suited perfectly to the material , and which he would never again display . " They Shoot Horses , Don't They ? " holds a sort of grisly fascination over its audience . Bleak as it is , it's also entertaining in a rather morbid way , making us feel like we're members of the audience watching this sick spectacle and making it that much harder for us to condemn the film audience without labeling ourselves as hypocrites .
Disturbing and Unsettling , But for Certain Tastes , Exquisite	Even if you don't like " Donnie Darko " ( and I'm sure there are many people who hate it , if they've ever even seen it ) , you're not likely to forget it quickly . This film lingers in the mind in a very unsettling way . It left me feeling creepy , and it's actually a fairly nihilistic film , but at the same time I was weirdly exhilarated by it , mostly because it's just so damn good . It's got an expert cast , including the Gyllenhaals ( Jake and Maggie ) , both of whom are two of the best young actors currently working , Mary McDonnell , Patrick Swayze ( yes , Patrick Swayze ) and Jena Malone . All the actors are top-notch and make so much of their characters that they prevent the film from falling into too-quirky-for-its-own-good territory , a fate that befalls many " independent " films . But praise must go to the writing and directing in this regard as well . At first it may seem that events and scenes are thrown in arbitrarily just for the sake of being weird , but everything comes together logically and powerfully . " Donnie Darko " is a movie for people who think too much . For those of us ( and I include myself ) who can never understand how , for example , religious people are so easily able to have a pat answer for everything that's complicated about the world in which we live , this movie gives us something to relate to . It doesn't provide answers , unfortunately , but there's something comforting about knowing other people out there are struggling with the same problems . Donnie almost can't live a functional life because of the anxiety caused by all of the unknowns about existence , and he sees the bland , self-help answers offered by so much of middle-class American society for what they are : shams to hide behind rather than to really help . He wants to be able to live without fear , without having to be convinced that there's a point to it all , but he can't , and watching him struggle with that is poignant and heart-breaking . This is a terrific film that deserves to be seen . I haven't seen the original version , so can't make comparison to the director's cut , but I have no complaints with it as is .
Wonderful Undiscovered Film About Sexual Maturity	A terrific lesser-known film that deserves a better rating than the one given it here at IMDb . Based on a short story by Joyce Carol Oates called " Where Are You Going , Where Have You Been ? " , " Smooth Talk " stars Laura Dern as a bored and restless adolescent who thinks she's more in control of her sexual allure , and more capable of handling the attention she receives for it , than she is . In a deeply unsettling and slightly surreal scene , a hunky stranger ( Treat Williams ) comes calling for her , and she realizes that she's not as mature as she thinks . The film captures the same other-worldly quality of the short story ( the scene with Treat Williams plays out almost like a feverish dream ) , while ably adapting it to the very different needs of a feature length film . Dern gives a wonderful performance , one of the many given by this underrated actress . And another lovely performance comes from Mary Kay Place , who plays Dern's mother . One of the most memorable scenes for me came when mother and daughter are in separate rooms of the house , but unbeknownst to each other are both privately dancing to the same song playing on the radio . I can never hear James Taylor's " Handyman " without thinking of this movie .
These Demons from Beyond Scared the Pants Off of Me	SCARY AS HELL ! ! ! ! This is one of the rare horror films that knows how to make gore frightening . But it's not just the blood and guts that terrifies here . it's Sam Raimi's accomplished direction and his fearless ability to make the movie so damn WEIRD that makes it such a good entry in the horror canon . A bunch of kids are staying in an isolated cabin in the woods and conjure up a bunch of demons from beyond . Sounds pretty standard . But Raimi directs with such a unique style - - cartoonish and campy in a way , yet utterly terrifying in spite of , or maybe because of , that approach - - that I wound up watching this film with one hand poised to cover my eyes at any moment , and I don't scare easily . I am not among those that think the film's sequel , " Evil Dead 2 , " is a masterpiece . Give me the first one any day .
Another Chipper Valentine to Romania	On the evidence of this and " The Death of Mr . Lazarescu , " Romanian filmmakers are trying to convince the world that Romania is the most depressing place ever , and they're very close to succeeding . College student Otilia ventures off into the dark Romanian night to help her friend , Gabita , get an illegal abortion . As the movie unfolds , it becomes less and less about Gabita's abortion , and much more about Otilia herself , who faces her own sort of crisis as she begins to put herself in Gabita's place and wonders if there's anyone in her life who would be willing to do for her what she herself is doing for her friend . The film's most disturbing scene is not the abortion , which isn't at all graphic and carries through without incident , but rather the scene immediately before it during which the abortionist casually humiliates both Gabita and Otilia , taking advantage of his power over them . He's just one of the many surly and callous people whom Otilia comes across during this long , dark night . The film is concerned with issues , but it's not an issue movie necessarily . At various times it explores male / female relations , the divide between the affluent and the working class , the dynamics of friendship , the strain of living under such a strict and oppressive government and the scant choices available to Romanian youths , especially women . But it explores these issues only as they affect our heroine , who may or may not have a pregnancy of her own to contend with . The acting is superb , especially that of Anamaria Marinca , as Otilia , and Vlad Ivanov in a terrifying performance as the abortionist from hell . Like " The Death of Mr . Lazarescu , " the style resembles documentary objectivity , with the camera simply sitting stationary while it records moments in long takes . It's a gray , depressing and deeply unsettling movie , but the grimness of it is somewhat offset by the exhilaration to be found in watching tremendously accomplished cinema unfold before your eyes .
I Love This Movie	If ever there was a love it or hate it film , this is it . " Brewster McCloud " is a glorious mess , an imperfect film in that fascinatingly imperfect way that only Robert Altman could pull off . I admit that much of my affection for this film lies in the fact that I studied it in a Robert Altman seminar ; each of us picked one movie to watch , analyze and report back on to the class , and this was mine . I was completely befuddled by it the first time I watched it , but then after I'd seen it three or four times , trying to make sense of it in order to talk to the class about it , I sort of fell in love with it . Brewster , played perfectly by Bud Cort , lives in the Houston Astrodome and harbors the intense desire to fly . His efforts in that direction are complicated by any number of odd-ball characters , including a rich tycoon for whom he works as a chauffeur ( an unrecognizable Stacy Keach delivers a howler of a performance as the tycoon , and has far too little screen time ) , a private investigator ( Michael Murphy ) with a penchant for colorful turtlenecks who's investigating a series of murders around the city , and a couple of bizarre female love interests , played respectively by Jennifer Salt and a divinely whacked out Shelley Duvall . Meanwhile , a sort of guardian angel ( Sally Kellerman ) with scars on her back where wings used to be follows Brewster around and may just be responsible for the murders taking place around the city ( every corpse the cops find is splattered with bird crap ) . And last but not least , in perhaps the most bizarre role ( and that's saying something in this movie ) , Rene Auberjonois plays some kind of professor delivering a lecture on man's desire to fly , who serves as a kind of narrator for the film and gradually turns into a bird himself . Much of the film doesn't really make any sense in a conventional way , even after multiple viewings . The film is a lot like Altman's break out hit , " MASH , " from the same year , with the overlapping dialogue , chaotic action and super-sarcastic sense of humour , but it doesn't have a universal topic like war around which to anchor itself , and many viewers might feel like they're watching an extended inside joke not meant for them . What is one to make , for example , of the use of Margaret Mitchell as a cranky old lady whose face we never see but whose voice is ingrained in our collective subconscious , and who is wearing an awfully familiar pair of ruby slippers when her body is found , victim to the mysterious avian serial killer ? The allusion to " The Wizard of Oz " of course is obvious , but what purpose does it serve ? The same can be said of Murphy's hilarious , dead-pan parody of Steve McQueen's character Bullitt , and the movie even includes a ridiculous and long high-speed car chase that pays homage to the one in that 1968 hit . It's all very funny , and maybe that's point enough , but I can't pretend to know what Altman was trying to say . But the ending , after all the glibness that has preceded it , comes to a poignant and quite emotionally affecting conclusion . Bud Cort is the perfect actor to make us root for Brewster , and once we see this strange and even rather creepy kid get himself airborne with a set of makeshift wings , our hearts soar and we want to see him achieve the impossible . Watching him frantically flapping his wings as he sails around the Astrodome , only to plummet to his death , offers a sad reminder that some dreams , no matter what optimists may say , are never attainable . Believe it or not , " Brewster McCloud " was the 1970 release that Altman thought would be the biggest hit , and he was very disappointed when " MASH " scored five Academy Award nominations and " Brewster " was ignored . One can't even conceive how Altman ever thought the stuffy Academy would go for something as esoteric as this .
A Beautiful Film About the Delicacy of Humanity	With " The Bridge on the River Kwai , " David Lean launched the string of " epics-with-a-soul " that would dominate the remainder of his career . In " Kwai , " Lean deftly juggles what seem like two entirely different movies to create one strong indictment of war's ability to strip men of their humanity . In one plot line , Alec Guinness , a British officer being held in a Japanese prison camp , locks horns with the commander of the camp ( Sessue Hayakawa ) , who puts Guinness and the other British soldiers in charge of constructing a bridge that will help the Japanese in their struggle to win the war . In the other dominant plot line , William Holden plays the leader of a platoon of men charged with blowing up said bridge . This plot line plays out like an exciting but fairly standard action film . It's the fascinating story of Guinness's transformation , not to mention his spectacular performance , that gives the film its status as a classic . The same quality of British perseverance that made Guinness such a loyal officer for the Allies works in Japanese favor as he becomes committed to building as fine a bridge as possible , forgetting its ultimate purpose . The film very eloquently communicates how noble attributes like loyalty and honor can be manipulated to satisfy what in certain circumstances can be perceived to be dubious ends , which , when you think about it ( though few people want to ) characterizes the basis of military recruitment everywhere . " Kwai " joined a batch of other 1957 releases - - like " 12 Angry Men , " " Paths of Glory " and " Sweet Smell of Success " - - in introducing a grittier and at the same time more poetic style of film-making that looked forward to the art-house style that would come into its own throughout the 1960s .
Guys and Dolls	Woody Allen sends up the world of Broadway and the gangsters who love it in this Runyonesque comedy , one of his very best . John Cusack is the Allen surrogate , a nebbish playwright who's struggling to remain true to his artistic vision amongst countless obstacles . Those obstacles include : a gangster's girlfriend ( Jennifer Tilly ) who Cusack is forced to cast in a lead role ; her bodyguard ( Chazz Palmienteri ) , who reveals quite a few dramatic instincts ; a high-maintenance diva ( Dianne Wiest , uproarious ) ; a leading man who eats too much ( Jim Broadbent ) ; and a dithery actress very much in love with her dog ( Tracy Ullman ) . Because Allen sets his movie in a world he knows well ( NY theatre ) , this feels like one of his strongest and most realized screenplays . The whole thing is a riot . Between Wiest , Tilly and Ullman , I still can't decide who's funniest .
Mein Fuhrer . . . . . I Can Walk !	" Dr . Strangelove " had to have seemed strange indeed to 1964 audiences . This came out in the same year as colorful , old-fashioned Hollywood fare like " My Fair Lady " and " Mary Poppins . " Yet " Strangelove " is far from old-fashioned or even colorful . Kubrick's film is stark and cold with a documentary-like air to it . It's also riotously funny . Peter Sellers is a film treasure . This film is a an orgy for Sellers fans , since he plays no less than three different characters , stretching his chameleon-like acting abilities to the limit . The funniest of his three characters is the dead-pan president of the United States , and the film's funniest scene involves him trying to gently break to the Russian premiere that we are about to launch a nuclear attack on his country . His portrayal of the title character is also inspired , and the image of Sellers in that wheelchair wrestling his black-gloved hand into submission with that crazy shock of hair and crazier glint in his eyes is unforgettable . The film also sports a great supporting cast , most notably George C . Scott as Buck Turgison , who discreetly takes calls from his bikini-clad girlfriend during war room briefings , Sterling Hayden as General Jack D . Ripper , who wields his cigar like a dangerous weapon , and Slim Pickens , as the pilot of the plane that is about to end civilization as we know it . My only complaint with the film is its somewhat sluggish editing , especially in the scenes showing the fleet of bombers on its way to their Russian targets . At times , the movie actually drags slightly , even though it's only 90 minutes long . But this is a minor quibble about a film that has rightly earned a spot in the cultural conscience of America . It will never be irrelevant as long as the ability to wage nuclear war exists , and it doesn't look like that problem will be going away any time soon .
A Superb and Frightening Film	Visuals rule in Dario Argento's splendid fever dream of a movie , " Suspiria . " The plot , which concerns a young American ballerina studying at a European school for dance and slowly discovering that it's run by a coven of witches , crumbles at even the slightest examination . And the film comes to a major anticlimax , and then just abruptly ends , leaving one to ask , " Is that it ? " But everything leading up to the end is so stylishly directed , and much of it truly frightening , that the overall impression is of a remarkable fright film . Doing away with the usual dark , shadowy visual style of the typical horror films , Argento instead takes the opposite approach , and bathes everything in lurid , saturated color . The effect , rather than cheapening or diluting the scares , enhances them , because everything takes on a nightmarish and disorienting quality when there are so many colors and visual textures dominating the frames . He also uses an original score tremendously , rivaling that most memorable of horror film scores , the one John Carpenter created for " Halloween . " ( Notably , Argento wrote the music for his own film as well ) . There are many sequences in " Suspiria " that deserve to go down in horror film history : the opening sequence , of course , of which much has been said , but equally disturbing are the shower of maggots , the attack of the blind man in the middle of a deserted city square , and the final scene in which Jessica Harper's ballerina character stumbles into the bedroom of the head witch . The only strike against " Suspiria " is the extent to which it steals from " Rosemary's Baby , " both in plotting and in visual style . But Argento , while perhaps inspired by Polanski's film , deserves credit for making something completely unique of his own .
The Screwiest of Screwball Comedies	O . k . , so maybe the absolute screwiest screwball comedy would be " Bringing Up Baby " from two years later , but " Godfrey " certainly runs a close second . If someone who didn't know what was meant by the term screwball comedy came to me and asked me to show them an example , I would pick either this film or " Baby . " " My Man Godfrey " is an example of what happened when all of the elements of 30s film comedy came together perfectly . It's a bit like " It Happened One Night " in that way ; much of the success of " Godfrey , " like Capra's earlier film , rests on bringing together the perfect ensemble with buckets of chemistry , but " Godfrey " one ups " Night " ( actually , soars right on past it ) on the zany meter . William Powell is flawless as the tramp taken in by the society ditz and " reformed . " Carole Lombard is adorable as said ditz , and her performance here is a sad reminder that her career was cut all too short by an early and accidental death . It seems like every comedy from this time period had to have a stock society matron character played by one from a pool of character actresses , and Alice Brady gets the honors here . Powell , Lombard and Brady were all nominated for Oscars , as was Mischa Auer in the first year the Academy gave awards in the supporting acting categories . It's a shame the Academy has forgotten that it once recognized excellence in screen comedy , and " My Man Godfrey " is about as excellent as screen comedy gets .
You May Never Have Heard of This Movie , But It's Well Worth Your Time	A fine little family drama I had never heard of , but which I'm now completely glad that I've seen . The title character of " Tully " is a young man struggling to come of age on the farm he works with his father and younger brother . Rebellious in spirit and darkly good looking , he's more socially and sexually experienced than his brother , and has a more contentious relationship with his dad . When a family secret surfaces , though , it becomes apparent that his bravado masks a great deal of insecurity , and proves that though he may be mature in some ways , he has a lot of maturing still to do in others . " Tully " has a quiet , low-key quality to it that I very much liked . It has a feel for the natural rhythms of rural life and the people who inhabit it . Grand epiphanies , emotional showdowns and the other stuff of traditional family dramas are not present here ; instead , turning points and realizations take place subtly and quietly . Many times it's the moments of silence that convey more than scenes filled with dialogue . The acting is tremendous , and the actors themselves inhabit these characters naturally and flawlessly . Even Tully ( Anson Mount ) , who's supposed to be charismatic and handsome , is charismatic and handsome in the way that someone would actually be in real life , not in the way that movie stars are .
Hits You Like a Gut Punch	This screen adaptation of the John Steinbeck classic novel is a harsh , fantastic film that took the wind out of me with its frank and brutal depiction of desperation and longing . Movies about the Depression that were actually made at the time of the Depression by people who knew of what they spoke by necessity feel so much more authentic than later movies that treat the Depression as a historical event . The men in this film are quite literally living day to day , and the comparison of men to dogs that serves as a running motif throughout the film feels like more than just a poetic device . Like dogs , these men were faced with the scary prospect of some day being of no more use , and there was no system in place to take care of them when that day came . Being shot like a dog put out of its misery by its owner really was preferable to the alternatives awaiting them . I was surprised about how candid this film was , and how bravely it tackled some of the thornier issues of Steinbeck's novel . The incident between Lenny and Mae is divested of some of its sexual overtones , but much is implied anyway . And a scene between Crooks , a black work hand , and some of the other workers , in which Crooks explains in blunt language what it means to be black , tackles race relations as honestly as many films today . Moments of this film are almost unbearably sad and poignant , but never in that over-sentimental way common to Hollywood films of this time period . Burgess Meredith is terrific in the role of George ; he expertly conveys - - without ever directly addressing it - - the bond he has with Lenny and the degree to which Lenny is as much George's savior as he is Lenny's . Charles Bickford is also excellent as a rough and world-weary worker . The cast's weak links are Betty Field - - hopelessly overplaying her bored sex kitten - - and Lon Chaney as Lenny , though both are very good in the pivotal scene that sets off the action of the film's finale . John Ford's adaptation of " The Grapes of Wrath " from the following year gets all of the attention today , and one hardly ever hears of " Of Mice and Men . " But much of what is great about Ford's film is also great about Lewis Milestone's , and he deserves credit for laying a fine blueprint for brining Steinbeck's beautiful and heartbreaking stories to the screen .
Romeo and Juliet : The Musical	This film version of the classic Broadway musical is hopelessly dated , but that's more a testament to how timely the material was than it is a criticism . Of course the image of gang violence portrayed here comes across as unbelievably quaint now , but compare this film musical to any other film musical of the time to see how gritty and different it probably seemed to audiences . Natalie Wood ( pretty , but not a great actress ) and Richard Beymer ( terribly miscast ) make no impression as young lovers Tony and Maria , but Rita Moreno , George Chakiris and Russ Tamblyn more than make up for any spark the leads fail to generate . Jerome Robbins ' choreography remains intact and looks terrific on screen , and the score by Leonard Bernstein may be the best ever composed for the musical theatre . I really like the look of this picture . The off-kilter camera angles and stylized production design generate the feeling that everything is transpiring in a feverish dream world and retain the artificial feel of an imaginary world , while Wise's fluid direction and use of actual New York exteriors at the same time open up the movie and give it a distinctly cinematic feel . Wise had a knack for adapting stage musicals that other film directors sorely lacked .
James Stewart and His Giant Bunny Are Absolutely Charming	James Stewart plays gentle soul Elwood P . Dowd in this charming , benevolent comedy spiced with hints of fantasy . Elwood is an eccentric man who consorts with an invisible 6 foot tall ( or 6 ' 3 " tall , to be exact ) rabbit named Harvey , much to the dismay of his sister and niece . They spend much of the film trying to have him committed to an institution so that he'll stop being an embarrassment to them , but their plans don't work , mostly because everyone with whom Elwood comes in contact is utterly beguiled by him . Elwood isn't " normal " like all of the other characters in the movie , meaning he's not uptight , cruel and worried about what others think of him . The movie asks its audience : would you rather be like Elwood or would you rather be " normal " ? Give me a giant invisible rabbit any day over the fussy characters with whom Elwood has to contend . It would be easy to dismiss Stewart's performance as too easy for him , as many critics did at the time of the film's release . But not just anyone could have played this character and made it work . Whether or not Stewart is acting the part well or is just being Jimmy Stewart in a well-matched role doesn't really matter , as the result is the same . He has a tremendous screen presence and carries the film , even though he's off-screen for much of it . " Harvey " is a sweet movie with a distinct strain of melancholia running through it . It's more about the way one wishes the world could be rather than the way it actually is .
Frankly . . . . This Is One Fine Movie	I know " Gone with the Wind " has been teased to death , and there seems to be a sort of snob appeal among the film critical community in denegrating this film as overblown Hollywood melodrama . But the thing that impresses me about " Gone with the Wind " after seeing it recently on the big screen is that it's one hell of a good movie . The entire first half moves with a propulsive energy that not many films can match . Victor Fleming ( billed as director , though there were at least four director names attached to the project ) stages one sensational set piece after another , and hardly a scene goes by without a quotable line or a memorable image . The success of any adaptation of " Wind " is going to rely greatly on its Scarlett , and here I can't say enough about Vivien Leigh's performance . I quite simply cannot imagine any other actress in this role , so perfectly does Ms . Leigh embody it . She's in virtually every scene , but even after four hours of her , I'm not tired of her , and her ability to captivate the screen while she's on it doesn't lessen for an instant . Clark Gable is Clark Gable , perfect for his role as well and an able match for Leigh , but his performance plays as window dressing as compared to Leigh's powerhouse work . I also want to mention Olivia de Havilland . In her own way , she is just as powerful in her role as Leigh is in Scarlett's . Melanie's character is less dynamic and so by sheer necessity de Havilland is frequently upstaged by Leigh . But she holds her own nonetheless . And what struck me is the chemistry the two actresses have when on screen together . The scene in which Scarlett attends a party dressed in bright red , braving the gossip she knows will attend her presence , and Melanie walks slowly forward , determined to prove herself a refined lady by welcoming Scarlett unconditionally , is a tour de force for both actresses . I take points away for some soap operatic elements in the second half that grind the story to a halt , but otherwise this film deserves its place as one of the greatest achievements in American cinematic history .
A Huge and Hugely Satisfying Movie	" Giant " lives up to its name . This fascinating movie - - part Douglas Sirk melodrama , part historical epic , part art-house film - - follows the fortunes of a well-to-do rancher in the wide-open spaces of Texas ( Rock Hudson ) and his wife ( Elizabeth Taylor ) , city bred and unused to the rigors of ranching . It spans many years in the lives of this family , beginning with the newlywed couple and following them into their middle age , as they raise their own children . Taylor gives the strongest performance in the film , while Hudson comes off as a bit too bland . James Dean delivers the final performance of his truncated career as a hot-headed oil baron who comes into money too quickly and at too early an age ; and Mercedes McCambridge appears briefly but memorably in the first few minutes of the film as the masculine , harsh and frighteningly violent sister of Hudson and arch rival of Taylor's feminine ways . " Giant " may not be a perfect film - - director George Stevens has been accused of becoming an increasingly ponderous and self-important artist throughout the 50s - - but I think it's a rather astonishing and gripping film . It manages to satisfy the craving for sweeping , wide-screen melodrama , a genre that no decade did better than the 50s , while at the same time give your intellect something to chew on . In this way , it's very much like the kind of epic David Lean would make his own throughout the next couple of decades .
A Tour de Force for Helen Mirren in a Film That Deserves Her	I was in college when Princess Diana died in a sensational car accident , brought about by a flock of determined paparazzi . To be honest , I didn't pay that much attention to the events going on across the pond . I was really no more than a child for much of the time that Diana was capturing the imagination of the American people , so I didn't fully understand her allure , and I certainly didn't understand , or care much , about the politics of the royal family . So watching " The Queen , " Stephen Frears ' wonderfully fluid account of the few days following the death of Di and its impact on the royal family , I had the uneasy feeling one gets when he realizes that something of extreme cultural importance has happened right under his nose without his realizing it . I had much the same feeling during " Hotel Rwanda . " It's the " I didn't realize all of THAT was going on " experience . I don't know how accurate " The Queen " is , and I don't know that anyone save Her Majesty herself could know for sure . Certainly it's an awfully one-sided movie . In Frears ' version of events , Tony Blair single-handedly saves the monarchy from the vitriol of the British people . It's only through his dogged determination that Elizabeth grudgingly lets go of her royal principles and gives the people what they need - - that is , a sign that the royal family is comprised of a group of people with actual blood in their veins and feelings in their hearts . Michael Sheen , an unfamiliar actor to me , plays Blair beautifully ; his performance goes beyond mere mimicry and conveys both the exhilaration and overwhelming sense of responsibility felt by a man who happens to find himself in a job for which he happens to be perfectly suited at one of the most critical moments in his country's history . But though everything is greatly slanted toward Blair , the film does a good job of cluing us in to Elizabeth's point of view as well . Here's a lady who inherited a job she did not choose , and who by the very nature of that job is turned into a media spectacle against her will . It's important to remember that during the moments when her and her family's callousness toward Diana and her death borders on the inhuman ; in their minds , Diana played a large role in her own death , and payed a fair price for the stardom she received in return . In Elizabeth's mind , the way the British people behave smacks of hypocrisy ; they cry out for blood for the media that caused Diana's death , yet want to hang the royal family for not putting themselves and their grief on display . Navigating the tricky waters of this tricky part is one of our greatest living actresses , Helen Mirren . Because I like her so much , it gives me great pleasure to say that her performance lives up to its hype . She gives what is so rare in films these days - - a tour de force of expert acting . Just watch her face and gestures throughout this film for the tiny nuances that speak volumes . Mirren has been buzzed about as the front-runner for this year's Oscar race since this movie opened , and for once I find the buzz completely justified . The Academy has a chance to show the world that it can , against all appearances to the contrary , recognize true art and talent when it sees it , so of course they'll probably botch things and give the award instead to a glamour puss who will look better on the cover of " People " magazine . But Mirren I'm sure will be the winner in many people's hearts regardless . Frears keeps things moving along with quick editing and a fantastic , staccato score whose effectiveness rests on its judicial use . There's something disorienting yet exciting about watching a movie about people who are alive and well , and still serving in the same roles as their fictional selves on screen . In some ways , " The Queen " feels like it should have come out last year , when a number of other relevant , terse and immensely engrossing films flooded the screens . Though if it had , it would have been one great film among many , whereas this year is has quickly risen to the cream of the crop .
A German Update of " All That Heaven Allows "	Rainer Werner Fassbinder's quietly powerful film is a sort-of remake of Douglas Sirk's " All That Heaven Allows , " a film and director greatly admired by Fassbinder , but it has a sharper edge than Sirk's film . In " Ali : Fear Eats the Soul , " the couple fighting a society's prejudice and resentment of their unconventional love must fight some of their own prejudices as well . In Sirk's film , the only thing imposing on the complete happiness of Jane Wyman and Rock Hudson was the busy-body ostracism of family and friends who didn't approve of the relationship between a rich society widow and her working-class gardener . In " Ali , " Fassbinder suggests that happiness isn't something that's gained from the approval of others , but rather is the responsibility of the individuals involved . One of the things I liked best about this film is that as the German society gets used to the unconventional romance and begins to accept our two protagonists , the couple themselves begin to struggle to maintain a grip on the happiness they thought would be their's by right . Fassbinder's unconventional couple are a frumpy German widow and a Moroccan immigrant 10-15 years younger than her . I gather from this film that Moroccans ( or Arabs in general ) were about as hated and feared in Germany at the time of this film's release as blacks were in America during the worst of the civil rights movement . So you can imagine how the couple's initial courting and subsequent marriage is handled by their neighbors , friends and family . Fassbinder himself was gay , and many suggest that the film is an allegory for the way homosexuals were persecuted . Fassbinder's private life undoubtedly informed his film , but the movie is really more universal than that . It really applies to anyone who's ever suffered the judgement of a group of people over something that didn't even affect those people , and really , who can honestly say that they've never been subjected to that ? Fassbinder directs in a low-key , unfussy style , yet he creates images and scenes that linger in the head long after the film is over . It's a lovely film , very well acted , scripted and directed . It's not exactly sad , because it argues that societies are able eventually to adapt to new things and accept things they originally rejected . But it's not exactly happy either , because it suggests that relationships don't necessarily become easier just because external obstacles are removed .
A Beautiful Statement About Humanity Triumphing Over Oppression	This superb , gripping film tells the story of a celebrated playwright , Georg Dreyman ( played subtly by Sebastian Koch ) living in the stifling oppression of the German Democratic Republic in the early 1980s , who is put under surveillance by a cabinet minister who loves Dreyman's girlfriend , the ill-fated Christa-Maria Sieland ( Martina Gedeck ) , and wants an excuse to ruin Dreyman's life . Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler ( Ulrich Muhe , giving the film's best performance ) is assigned surveillance duties , and stakes himself out in the attic of Dreyman's apartment building , listening in on Dreyman's conversations and numerous intimacies . Dreyman is not a subversive , at least not in deed , until a beloved friend in the theatre commits suicide because of a ruined career brought about by the GDR officials . This loss compels Dreyman to action , and he writes a scathing indictment of the GDR which he publishes anonymously in a West German liberal magazine . Wiesler knows that Dreyman is the author , but has become so fascinated by Dreyman and his life , and so doubtful as to the moral motives of the GDR , that instead of turning Dreyman into the authorities , he becomes his secret accomplice . " The Lives of Others " begins solidly but unremarkably . I enjoyed the first half hour or so of the film , but wasn't heavily involved in it . But it works a kind of intense , gradual spell , and before I realized it , I was engrossed in this story and cared deeply about how it would end . A plot summary makes it sound like a highbrow soap opera , or like something we've seen before , but it's not either of these things . It's a thematically rich film anchored by a strong central character in Wiesler . He's fascinated by Dreyman's life - - his artistic abilities , his circle of friends and the stimulus of freely shared ideas , the love and companionship he shares with an attractive woman - - but it's Wiesler who for us becomes the fascinating character . We see his life juxtaposed to Dreyman's - - coming home to an empty apartment , hiring a prostitute for a fleeting moment of intimacy - - and we understand exactly why he takes the actions he does throughout the film . His life is utterly lacking in any kind of artistic or intellectual freedom , and when he begins to fake reports about the goings on in Dreyman's apartment , making up entire episodes and even giving elaborate details about a fake play he claims Dreyman is writing , we see how just the tiny bit of freedom granted him to create something completely his own becomes the crack in the foundation of his loyalty to his superiors . It's a wonderful statement about the power of free thought to combat oppression , and at the same time a lovely story about simple human kindness . The ending especially is breathtaking in its sweet simplicity . And as I'm a fan of film scores , let me say that this film has a marvelous one , especially the recurring passage of pulsing strings that drives the movie forward and creates all the hair-raising tension of a Hitchcock film .
No Trouble with This Lubitsch Comedy	That rare thing : the perfect film comedy . " Trouble in Paradise , " Ernst Lubitsch's sparkling 1932 comedy , stars Herbert Marshall and an adorable Miriam Hopkins as con artists in love , while Kay Francis plays the woman who comes between them . The film is fast , sexy , effortless and absolutely charming . People always refer to " the Lubitsch touch " when talking about the famous director's films , and I understand completely what they mean . There's something about his films that's common to all of them but is very hard to describe . It has something to do with tone - - all of his films feel like they're perfectly balanced between humor , sentimentality , pathos and melancholy . They're funny , but none of them feel like insignificant fluff ; there's an underlying strain of melancholy running through all of them , yet none of them make the mistake of taking the world too seriously . I don't know what it was that made his films so delightful , but I love it .
Don't Be Stupid , Be a Smarty , Come and Join the Nazi Party	Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder aim Mel Brooks ' bawdy jokes at the third balcony , and the result is one of the funniest movies ever made . As anyone who doesn't live under a rock by now knows , Mostel and Wilder play Max Bialystock , failing Broadway producer , and his hysterical accountant , Leo Bloom , respectively . When the two realize that they can make more money off a Broadway flop than they can with a hit , they set out to make the worst show ever made , and " Springtime for Hitler " is born . The fun in " The Producers " is watching Max and Leo assemble their team of show-biz disasters . Not since Dorothy skipped down the yellow brick road on the way to Oz has a more colorful assortment of characters been added one by one to a film's cast . There's the play's author Franz Liebkind , who spontaneously bursts into the Nazi anthem and whose plans include world domination ; Ulla , the Swedish tease , whose hips move independently from her torso and who Max meets in the public library ; Roger DeBris , who thinks the third act of the play " has got to go " because the Nazis are losing the war ; his " assistant " Carmen Ghia , who slinks around wearing a pointy beard and a monocle and who enjoys ( maybe too much ) his ride in the elevator with Max and Leo ; and last but not least , Lorenzo St . DuBois , also known as LSD , who sings perhaps the film's funniest song , " Love Power , " while wearing furry thigh boots and finger cymbals and which ends with him breaking a banana in half and sticking his thumb in his mouth . The high point of the movie , of course , is the " Springtime for Hitler " production number , that includes dancing girls dressed as pretzels and beer tankards and includes lines like " We're marching to a faster pace / Look out , here comes the master race . " Just the shot of the audience watching the show , their mouths hanging open in dumbstruck shock at its awfulness , is alone worth sitting through the movie for . My only complaint with " The Producers " is really a compliment , and it's that there's not enough of it . The whole movie has a sketch-comedy feel , and each supporting character gets really no more than a big scene or two . I really wanted more of Roger and Carmen , and more of LSD . And of course it would have been great if Brooks had filled out " Springtime for Hitler " even more . Indeed , that number is such a show stopper that the movie deflates a bit after it's over and never quite recovers . This is easily Brooks ' best film , and it's wonderful to see such an unapologetically in-your-face comedy work so well . It's crass and crude and silly , yet remarkably intelligent all at the same time . If you don't come away with at least a dozen lines to quote , you weren't paying attention .
A Reputation Deserved	There's not much to say about " Citizen Kane " that hasn't already been said . I know there are people who don't understand why this film is considered to be one of the most brilliantly made films ever produced , but I propose the reason for that is this : the film and narrative techniques on display in " Kane " have become so integral to every film made since that they no longer seem special in Orson Welles ' film when looked at from a 21st Century perspective . I encourage anyone still in doubt of this film's greatness to instead look at it from an historical perspective ; just compare it to any other movie that also came out in 1941 and I think " Kane " ' s uniqueness will be apparent . I don't think the film is without flaws . Welles ' pacing can be slow at times , and I think the last quarter of the movie especially drags . The story itself isn't particularly interesting or even novel for its time , but one doesn't ( or shouldn't ) watch " Kane " for the originality of the story . Instead , pay attention to how the story is told and who's telling it . When the film is over , ask yourself this : can you say you've been given an objective account of Kane's story ? Do you really know what happened to him ? This is radical stuff for 1941 . Can you imagine a movie being released at that time that didn't answer the questions it raised ? The motivation that puts the entire world of the film in motion remains unresolved . That doesn't happen very often in films even now , let alone then . And if none of this is reason enough to watch " Citizen Kane , " just watch it for the stunning cinematography and compositions . Virtually every frame is a work of art in itself . And if that isn't reason enough to watch it , then just watch it for Orson Welles ' mesmerizing performance in the title role . Easily one of the ten best in cinema history . And if that isn't reason enough to watch it , you're on your own .
Does for Sound Recordings What " Blowup " Did for Photographs	" The Conversation " is a deeply unsettling film about a surveillance expert ( Gene Hackman ) , who becomes involved in the private lives of a couple on whom he is spying when he hears a fragment of a conversation that suggests the two will be murdered . The truth that he uncovers rocks his world to its foundations , and the man who's spent his life uncovering the secrets of others suddenly is forced to wonder what secrets others might be uncovering about him . " The Conversation " seems to be somewhat overshadowed by Francis Ford Coppola's other 1974 release , " The Godfather Part II , " but I think this is the more fascinating film . He brings an eerie , art-house style to this film that compliments nicely the accessible , linear storytelling of his famous crime saga . This film actually becomes more and more prescient with each passing decade , when the Internet has guaranteed that complete anonymity and privacy is virtually impossible .
Noir for a Nuclear Age	Sleazy , tawdry B-noir doesn't get any sleazier or tawdrier than Robert Aldrich's jazzy and astonishingly entertaining " Kiss Me Deadly . " This film was released late in the life cycle of the film noir genre . By 1958 and Orson Welles ' " Touch of Evil , " true noir would be just about washed up . Any noir film from that point forward would be self-consciously aware that it was tipping its hat to an established genre . But " Deadly " came out when films still didn't have to work at being noirish - - - they just WERE , and dazzlingly so . Born-to-play-a-bully Ralph Meeker plays tough-guy detective Mike Hammer , who's in the wrong place at the wrong time and picks up a mysterious panic-stricken girl ( Cloris Leachman ) , who's just escaped from an asylum . From that moment forward , he finds himself tangled up in a barely lucid plot , in which a bunch of baddies want to get their hands on something the girl either had or knew about . Hammer doesn't know what it is , but he knows that if so many people want it , it's something he probably wants too , and the race for the great " whatsit " is on . If you wanted to teach a film class about the look and attitude of a film noir , you couldn't pick a better film than this one . I found myself on a recent viewing of this film pausing my DVD player and studying the frame ( because , sadly , this is what I do in my spare time ) , rehearsing in my mind what I would tell a class about any particular composition . And aside from the style , the film is steeped in noir sentiment - - it's not simply cynical , like the glossier studio noirs of the 40's ; it's downright apocryphal . It's not simply one man undone by the vengeful forces of fate here , but an entire civilization on the brink of extinction . So pop this in and have a great time with it - - feel free to quote it liberally , as there are plenty of juicy lines worth quoting . But as you watch it , you might want to stay away from the windows , for as Mike Hammer's hot-to-trot sometime girlfriend , sometime secretary Velda says , someone may " blow you a kiss . "
