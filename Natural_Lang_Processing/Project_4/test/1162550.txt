Insiped and boring	A nurse and fashion model , sharing an apartment , rail against lab testing on mice , like the air headed bimbos they are . After the rats attach the nurse , they take a trip to a nudist camp ( the women , not the rats ) , only to be terrorized by a fat retarded janitor . Unlike the better " Best that Killed Women " , this one is totally inept and taking forever for ANYthing to happen , a true chore to sit through . One good note neither the Director , nor the cast made ANYthing EVER again . So at least there's some kind of happy ending to be had after all . DVD Extras : On a double-Bill with " The Beast that Killed Women " ; 9 Shorts ( Bring ' em back nude , Expose of the Nudist Racket , Nude Ranch , Beauty and the Beast , Back to Nature , Nudist Fashion show , and 3 intermissions ) ; Gallery of Exploitation art ; Vintage Drive-in intermission ; Trailers for " The Beast that Killed Women " , " Eves on Skis " , " Goldilocks and the Three Bares " , " Nudes on Tiger Reef " , " Nudist Life " , and " Pussycat Paradise " Easter Egg : Highlight Jesse James Drive-In for a bonus Trailer for " Girls Come Too " Eye Candy : It's mostly set at a nudist camp . . duh , so loads of breasts and buns , only bushes are trees tho
All For Naught	A group of friends go to Club Hedonism for Brandon's bachelor party . They play a game of sexual conquests , only to invoke the wraith of Sonja a crazy stalker cozier who mistakenly thinks Brandon with the one of the trio that jilted her thanks to one of his other friend that told her he was Bradon . That dude's an ass . This movie is pretty sub-par & i hated how the trio of guys all spoke with their hands . Skip itMy Grade : DThe Goods : 8 sex scenes ( m / f , m / f / f , f / f ) Babe of the movie : Hands down ( or is that hands around ? ? ) Julien Jackson who I think is an alias of Mia Zottoli as Tamara
Why do I even bother watching " Something Weird " DVDs ? ? Am I this masochistic ? ?	Everyone seems to conspire against a very naive hayseed of a boxer . But the plot is once again secondary to sex . Sadly the sex to plot ratio in this Harry Novak produced film is off-kilter and not in a good way . Uschi Digard does longer and better screnntime than she did in " The Godson " , but that's the only thing good about this film that I can truly think of . The theme song sucks as much as the " Squirm " theme song by the way . It also comes paired with the movie " The Godson " on the Something Weird DVD . DVD Extras : Short Subjects : " I , Uschi " and " Uschi meets Dracula ; Gallery of Exploitation art ; Gallery of exploitation photos ; Theatrical Trailer ; Trailers for " The Godson " , " Bust Out " , " Fugitive Girls " , " The Mafia Gang " , " The Manhandlers " , " Prison Girls " , " A Scream in the Streets " , and " Up your Valley " Easter Egg : " Tittilated Tex " Trailer Eye Candy : Rene Bond , Usci Digard , Mirka Madnadraszky , and Terri Johnson
Warning : Will cause severe drowsiness	Super Badass leaves farm life for the big city in 1957's Mississippi to become a hard-drinking , drug-taking , pigeon-filming bounty hunter . His father warns that Death will be riding behind him . Needless to say , a masked guy with a Death license plate does indeed ride behind him . He goes after the likes of The Boogyman , Bucko the Clown , Light Bulb , and various other riff-raff . I feel that nearly any subject matter can be filmed well , if the Director of said subject matter is talented , or at the very least competent . But in this instance the Director Charles Cullen seems to possess neither of those traits . And as suck , those who have the misfortune to suffer through this are in for the longest 70 minutes of your life . DVD Extras : Film maker's Intro ; Commentary by Charles Cullen , Will Henson , and Kenny Hicks ; and a Compilation Tralier for " Boogieman " , " Boogieman 2 " ; " A Modern Day Western " ; " Super Badass " , and " Night of the Bums "
Worst DVD in the history of cinema Part 1 : Loons	Why the Summary ? Well i caught this " movie " ( note the quotation marks ) on a DVD released by Sub-Rosa that also had " Cutthroats " on it , it also had a short on it , but my DVD player broke down before I got to see it ( must have gotten good taste ) . I started Loons hoping for the best , which i do for all independent films . I sat through the Prologue in utter disbelief . it was 15 of the most mind-numbing , cringe-inducing piece of excrement that I have ever been subjected to . After 15 MINUTES the titles begun playing . . the opening titles . I thought to myself ok , now it'll get better , because it can't get worse . . I was wrong . I was SO VERY wrong . I have no idea how long this was , it felt like hours upon hours upon hours on end . with NOTHING happening , the " movie " just was running in circles just like some mongoloid puppy that is missing it's left front leg & a tail . The " movies " about some curse that makes Loon men crazy . Get It Loon ? ? Thats the extent of the " humor " Upon ending the film , i choose to watch the second feature on this DVD . . was it good ? ? Stay tuned for part two ( CutThroats ) I'll give you a hint on the answer . . . HELL NO ! ! !
woof ! !	Angie , fresh out from the mental asylum after seven years there due to trauma suffered from the grisly murder of her family by a ' Twisted Metal ' like clown , wants to leave the past behind her , but Mr . Jingles ( aforementioned clown ) has other plans for her in this supremely sub-par horror effort . The acting is amongst the worst you'll likely to see , the death gore is incompetent at best , the plot horribly clichéd and felt like the ' script ' was made up as they went along . And while this is my first viewing of any movie by the husband / wife Brunswick team , I sincerely hope it's also the last . I'm usually willing to give movie makers a few chances , but in this case I'd rather go toe-to-toe with Tommy Morrison NOW , so yes it's just that bad . Eye Candy : Heather Doba and Jessica Hall both get topless but neither are worth sitting through this travesty for
my god the horror , the horror	After a simply awful monologue about the ferocity of bull sharks and an equally putrid shark attack , we're ' treated ' to about 2 and a half minute of nothing but footage of sailboats ( seriously I timed it with my mouth hanging open , dumbfounded with each passing minute , not to be out done the ending 4 minutes are nothing but a view of the ocean , but I digress ) . The movie is about the aforementioned bull shark ( oh and when we do see this thing , it appears to be a rubber toy shark of the 2 dollar variety ) attacking various people at a marina where a sailing race is going to be held . Billed as a comedy , this doesn't even work well as that . There's a reason that I seem to be the first ( hopefully only ) person to comment on this film on this site , it's atrocious and I wouldn't wish it to be watched even by my worst enemy . It's also one of the few films that I'm very thankful that the actresses kept their clothes on throughout .
The Horror Within this movie is excruciatingly bad	Eight college friends go to one of their dad's house in the mountains to finish up their movie " the Curse of the Weremonkey " ( which humorously enough would probably be much better than this film ) . The house also happens to contain Nick , a vamiperic caretaker who's more then glad to have such delectable morsels show up on his doorstep . It's up to them to survive until daylight . Low-budget vamp flicks are a dime a dozen and most of them are horrid . This definitely falls in that category . Due to the awful acting , horrible ( lack of ) story , and sub-par special effects . Nothing original at all happens in this movie and you've seen variations of it in other ( much ) better ones . My advice is to skip this flick , as the Horror Within this flick is excruciatingly bad . Eye Candy : Michelle Craine gets topless multiple times ; an unknown extra also flashes tit Where I saw it : Netflix on Demand
I was hoping that the nurse would put ME out of my misery	Laura Harriman is a nurse that gets so distraught that her embezzling father shot her mother & brother before killing herself that she jumps at the chance to be caregiver to Bob Martin ( Michael Fairman , who ironically does the best acting in the film ) , the man who gave her father up & had a stroke leaving him paralyzed but fully aware . She kills the first nurse , takes her place , then . . . well nothing , lots and lots of talk , about the fifth time she talked to bob about what she'd do to his family out of revenge I was about ready to put myself out of my misery & when something DOES finally happen late in the movie I found myself way too bored to care . A complete boring , predictable , anti-climatic mess of a film .
utter crap ( revised review )	A terrible amateur movie director ( no , not Todd Sheets ) , his new friend and sister explore a cave . The friend and sister fall in and get rescued . Meanwhile a gang of horribly acted girls are defending their ' turf ' . Whatever the heck that means . This film and I use the term VERY loosely is so bad that it's . . well bad . The humor is painfully unfunny , the " action " merely sad . Now I've seen some atrociously awful ' horror ' films in my time & failed to grow jaded in my approach to watching low-budget films , yet I still weep openly for anyone who choose to sit through this . ONLY for the most hardened maschocists amongst you . but the rest run away FAST ! !
ummm . . . what the ?	OK the plot is , wait you got me there is no true discernible plot here just a string of optically fogged sex scenes , strung together by scenes of photographers taking pictures of pretty ladies ( Sometimes a combination of the two ) Then a demon comes around kills the men , rapes and kills the women , and waxes poetic about the meaning of life . Moronic special effects , bad acting and bizarre philosophy aside , you get what you expect from a film with a title like this . I guess it would have to be someone's cup of tea , just not mine as I have yet to see a good Kazuo ' Gaira ' Komizu directed film . DVD Extras : Subtitled Interview with Director Kazuo Komizu Part 1 ( Part 2 is on the Entrails of a Beautiful Woman DVD ) ; and Theatrical Tailer
because CGI rodents biting people in the crotch is the height of hilarity , right ?	The best part of having a girlfriend is , of course , the copious amounts of sex . On the flip-side , the worst part of having a steady girlfriend is having to sit through many MANY crappy movies , this brings me to the topic at hand " Without A Paddle 2 " which has nothing at all to do with the first one ( which ironically I also was conned into watching when it came out , different girl though , but I digress ) This one revolves around a guy who meets a vegetarian animal-rights crusader while on the first day of high school , she gets expelled the second day before she can so his ' cool ' homemade ' Meat is Murder ' T-shirt ( I guess the Che shirts were all sold out ) Anyways years little his friend , who works in a nursing home , accepts the dying wish of an ancient old lady to find her grand-daughter , whom winds up being , yup you guessed it , little Mizz Feminist crusader . So he , his friend , and a snotty English guy with ulterior motives travel to her last known whereabouts deep in the rain-forests . This film was atrocious , the joke aren't just easily telegraphed , they're also massively unfunny , the acting is sub-standard and I didn't give a toss about any of the characters involved in the least . Also Jerry Rice was a great football player , and as an actor he was a great football player . That was seriously painful to watch . The only good thing that came from this film is the sex I got for being forced to deal with this major eye sore of a ' movie ' . It's all about reparations people . DVD Extras : A 10 minute Making-of ; ' Furious Nuts ' featurette which is 7 minutes about the CGI-squirrels ; ' Treehouse Tales ' three minutes about the treehouse sets ; a gag reel ; 4 very short deleted scenes ; and Tralers for " Van Wilder : Freshman year " , " American Teen " , " Stoned Age " , " ' Kenny Vs . Spenny ' Volume 1 , ' TV Funhouse Uncensored '
a Time to change the channel	Traci Lords ( who as horrible as she is can still out act Sharon Stone almost any day of the week ) is Jackie , a photographer who finds herself being framed for possession of coke by a cop on the take . So she reluctantly teams up with another cop ( Jeff Conway , whom his role in Taxi grows more and more ironic throughout the years ) to clear her name . This movie is the definition of bad . Horrible acting , totally inept dialog , idiotic action sequences , and a script from Charles Kanganis all collide to make this travesty a must miss . Oh and Jackie has one of the most annoying kids this side of " Problem Child " and Richard Roundtree also has a small part as a police captain ( yes the early 90's were a horrid half decade for Shaft ) . Eye Candy : Nitchie Barrett gives the only two reasons to even think of subjecting yourself to this , but sadly nothing close to what she showed in " Preppies " Where I saw it : Showtime Extreme
Carissa doesn't explain a thing	In a post-WWIII apocalyptic world , people continue to have sex , but now some of them have special powers such as telepathy . Meanwhile the government loyalist thy to find all the Rebels , of which Peter North is one . He has to avoid them as he's on his way home . I found this porn parody of " Mad Max Beyond ThunderDome " highly disjointed and just not very erotic . None of the actors , or pairings of said actors really stick out in my mind is steamy in the least . Don't be fooled by the catchy name as I sadly was . The goods : 7 Sex Scenes ( M / F , M / F / F , M / F / M ) DP , masturbation My Porn
pretty asinine	While mucking around on the school computer trying to change his grades , geeky Howard Duckell , receives a zap that imbues him with mind-controlling powers . Which he uses to embarrass his sister , school bully , and help his equally dorky friend out . He also has to deal with a scientist who's trying to take the powers away from him and get the girl he's interested in without using said powers . None of the above are particular funny in any sense . Furthermore , the film that this seems to want to emulate " Zapped " is endlessly better so watch that movie instead . Eye Candy : Cecilia Bergqvist gets topless ; Stacy Burke , Brandy Miller , & Darby O'Riley provide the T & A ; Sandy Wasko shows everything ( Summer Altice & Cindy Campbell get topless in the DVD deleted scenes ) DVD Extras : Director's Commentary ; slide-show gallery ; 23 deleted & extended scenes ( with nudity ) ; Promotional trailer for this film ; and Trailer for " the Hazing " Easter Egg : In the extras menu Highlight the teacher's panties and click on them for a short clip of Amy Brasette ( no nudity )
rancid	Dave Dearborn ( Tom Keena , the most improbable action hero if ever there was one ) is a journalist in Singapore on a assignment on a crime boss . He's soon awash with dealings with strippers , nuclear scientists , CIA operatives , and large-toothed mobsters ( among others ) . The acting all around is atrocious , the plot , for lack of a better term , is a mess , the " hero " throughly unconvincing by any stretch of the imagination , and Janet Wood is the extremely unwanted love smitten girl who hangs on to Dave , all are rancid ingredients that torpedo this movie to the lower regions of cinema where all the other unwatchable turds dwell . Oh and if one were to edit out all the padding that the movie has it would be half an hour shorter at the least . Eye Candy : Janet Wood shows her breasts ; Angelique Pettyjohn provides the T & A ; and Victoria Racimo shows everything
Even the best Polonia brothers film is still crap	The Polonia twins are not only Among Us , they continue to unleash mind-blowing crap like this two ( sometimes 3 ) per year . Sometimes with budgets soaring up to tens of dollars . Having suffered ( barely ) through mind-numbing utter crap like " Holla if I Kill You " , " House That Screamed " , it's sequel , AND Hellspawn ( yes I know i'm masochistic ) , I came into this ' film ' expecting the worst . And i'm happy ( happy being used quite loosely indeed ) to inform you that those particular expectations were met quite nicely . From the dreadful opening replete with endless minutes of fart noise to the endless shower sequences that features absolutely NO nudity . From the faux trailer and music videos to the horrendous sound ( music overwhelms the actors ' speaking at times ) . As craptacularly bad this tale of a struggling B-grade film maker who meets a real Bigfoot after making a career out of making horror films about the fabled creature is , it's actually one of the better efforts from Polonia , if you can believe it . This is due , in no small part , because the writer of it ISN'T a Polonia ( they just directed it ) this time around . Even with a good half of the film , if not more , is filler .
even Travelocity's garden gnome is scarier	Daniel ( Vinnie Bilancio ) , a crime scene photographer who's just recently back from a mental hospital , stumbles onto a devious plot involving the BDSM community , grisly murders , and gnomes ( make that invisible gnomes that only he can see via his broken inferred camcorder ) Of course no one believes him so it's up to Daniel , with some help from Devinity ( Melissa Pursley ) who teaches him the ways of BDSM , to save the day . This is an ultra low-budget mess of a film that I found awful due to the horribly wooden , stunted dialog and sub-par special effects ( I've seen scarier muppets ) . It didn't help matters that the plot itself is groan-worthingly atrocious . Put all those rancid ingredients together and you have a movie that just screams of epic fail . Eye Candy : Elizabeth Hayden Grace , Melissa Pursley , Julie Strain , ' zen ' , & ' zero'Danial ( Vinnie Bilanchio ) and get topless ; Heather Darling shows T & A ; Athena Demos shows everything Where i saw it : Netflix online via Xbox 360
Who watches the Watcher ? . . . . . Sadly I do	Detective Campbell ( James Spader ) must track serial killer , David Allen Griffin ( Keanu Reeves ) who has been playing a cat and mouse game with him even going so far as to move to Chicago after Campbell does so . Campbell , a broken mess , thanks to already losing a loved one due to his obsession with Griffin has to make sure that never happens again . If the police in this film were competent in the least they would've caught the perp in the first 10 minutes , thus saving me the next 87 , sadly this is not the case as Griffin parades more or less under their noses right in the open . The ineptitude of these Keystoneesque cops almost had me screaming at the screen in utter disbelief . The acting which is mundanely mediocre did not help matters in the slightest . To top it off the whole mess was at turns extremely trite , contrived & cliché . I'm sorry I watched it .
Short , i'll give it that	Cornman was once a normal man but he fell into toxic waste and now can communicate with corn he also has Butterboy , a stupid sidekick . He uses this power to fight Dr . Hoe , an evil guy in this low low budget campy film . I don't like these types of non-troma intentionally campy , self-referential no budget films . They might cause the makers to laugh their collective asses off , but the viewer is likely to just shrug it off , if they can make it through the whole movie , which really is a crap shoot as it's only 69 or so minutes . Wall to wall fake punk music throughout the film doesn't help at all . It's grating on the nerves . DVD Extras : Intro by Lloyd Kaufman ; 3 Commantary tracks ; 11 minutes and 20 seconds of behind the scenes footage ; deleted scenes with intro ; and Preview Trailer Easter Egg : In the Extras menu there's a hidden question mark , click it for a short teaser for " Prison-a-go-go " another mind-numbingly awful film
so bad it's entertaining	After his father has his head blown off and his fiancé dry-humped as well as killed before his eyes as he was tied up , beat to a pulp and forced to watch , Alex ( World Champion kick-boxer Curtis Bush ) is nursed back to health by a Vietnam Vet , who has his own beef with the mafioso , who trains him to become a lean-mean revenge taking machine as the avenging vigilante , ' the Dark Angel ' Clearly this film's of the ' so bad , it's good ' variety and is so unintentionally laughably inept in pretty much every aspect of the movie ( except the fight scenes that are at least passable ) that one can't help but crack a smile at the sheer awfulness of it all . Eye Candy : Kim Reynolds shows off her T & A ( and ' blink & you'll miss it ' muff ) My Grade : as a real film I'd rate it as a 1 , but i'll add an extra star or two ( or three ) just for the ( brain dead ) entertainment factor alone . Shock-o-Rama DVD Extras : 3 unintentionally humorous news clips about Curtis Bush ; Trailers for " Bacterium " , " Chainsaw Sally " , " Dark Chamber " , " Drainiac " , " Millennium Crisis " , " Bite Me ! " , " Creature from the Hillbilly Lagoon " , " Feeding the masses " , " Prison-a-go go " , " Screaming Dead " , " Shock-o-rama " , " Sinful " , & " Skin Crawl " ; the DVD also contains a second movie " Canvas of Blood "
not as bad as Gigli , but close	Ben Affleck has to parent his newborn daughter after his newlywed wife dies while giving childbirth in this trite little film that tries so hard to be heartwarming , but fails miserably ( you haven't laughed into you see Affleck TRY to be melodramatic and cry ) . As bad as Ben is , the other actors don't come out of this blot on Kevin Smith's career unscathed either . Liv Tyler is simply wasted , I haven't been this disappointed in George Carlin since " Outrages Fortune " , and in all likelihood poor Raquel Castro has doomed her career before it even started . The story in this movie is nothing you've never seen a million times before in other films and much much better . If anything good came from the film it was that it truly showed Kevin Smith where his bread & butter is . So bring on Clerks 2 ( and 3 , 4 , 5 . . etc ) And may Mr . Smith never stray from dick and fart jokes again . Where I Saw it : Showtime on Demand
boring	A little less fluffy as the other putrid masturbatory extra related to this film , " My Buddy , Jack " , but not very much so . It's funny when the director boasts about how many cameos he got in the film of famous people . You know what who cares ? If he concentrated less on getting cameos and more on , say , making the movie , I don't know . . . FUNNY , then he might have had a good ( or at least passable ) film on his hands . But I guess that was way more to ask for from the Director of " Nutty Professor 2 " and the Writer of " My Boss's Daughter " . This 18 minute featurette can be located on the region 1 special edition DVD of the movie " Anger Management " My grade :
Shocking bad for the director of Rocky , and the Karate Kid	Let's get the fact that this film isn't as much as a complete and total disaster as Belushi's earlier " 1941 " fiasco . Of course that being said is somewhat damning it with faint praise indeed . I keep hearing how this movie is a " classic black comedy " , well it's really none of those things . Extremely far from being classic in any way , shape , or form . As a black comedy " Heathers " runs circles around it . And even the word comedy can only be very loosely applied to this film . It may contain a chuckle or two , but thats the most you'll expect if you find yourself watching this absurdist Looney Tunes-esquire sloppily directed film about a couple ( Cathy Moriarty playing a nympho and Dan Aykroyd playing Bugs Bunny ) moving next to another more prudish couple ( John Belushi as Elmer Fudd and Kathryn Walker as his bitch wife ) . For absurd done right rent " Clue " instead and leave this on the video store bargain bin along with " 1941 " , " Doctor Detroit " , " D . A . R . Y . L . " , and " Rough Cut "
An anti-violence as entertainment film made by the WWE ha ! !	10 killers from around the world compete in a reality TV show , with the last man living getting their freedom . This is a complete and utter rubbish version of the exponentially better " the Running Man " . Steven Williams Aka Stone Cold does the best he can do with such a hopelessly contrived and clichéd character as his role as Jack Conrad is , but poor Steve has little to no charisma in his movie roles . And for a movie that has to rely on it's action , like this film does , it's all deathly boring , making it's nearly 2 hour running length feel like an endless eternity . The only one that saved himself some face after starring in this train wreck is Vinnie Jones , but even he ( no matter how good he was ) could save the film . Of the five movies currently released by WWE films ( which I'm quickly learning to avoid as much as those produced by MTV ) , this is without a doubt the worst . Keep in mind , they made See No Evil as well . . . Region 1 DVD Extras : 2 Audio commentaries ( the first with Director Scott Wiper , the second with Wiper and Stone Cold ) ; a 6 minute making of ; a short bit about Vinnie Jones doing a guest spot on WWE ; a short bit of Stone Cold at Movie world in Australia ; Storyboard sequences ; Theatrical trailer for the film ; and trailers for " See no Evil " , the special edition DVD of Universal Soldier , the extended cut of The Punisher , & " War "
Huge letdown	Six people are taking a tour of Ultra Studios when they get trapped in a haunted house ( that's not usually on the tour , but they have VIP passes ) . They . along with their tour guide , have some horror stories to tell in the hopes of breaking free from the house somehow . Phoebe is first and opts to tell the story of how she got implants from a human cadaver in order to help advance her movie career . But these tits are hungry for flesh . Directed by Ken Russell , this segment was slightly over the top and fun ( in a rather stupid way ) , but didn't really go anywhere and had a non-ending . It came off like a disregarded idea from that Playboy awful " Inside Out " series from the ' 90's . Next up is married couple , Julia and Henry , who tell the tale of their trip to Japan and an ill-fated painting that leads to a Buddhist monk who possesses the wife , driving her crazy . Aside from some nifty animation toward the end of this Sean S . Cunningham directed short , I couldn't help but feel underwhelmed by this one . Leo ( the great John Saxon ) gets to tell the third story , of him and his friend , Stanley . With parallels to Stanley Kubrick's early career ( not the supernatural tinge to it obviously ) this was the most interesting of the quintet of stories that comprised the film . But it's a bit on the dry side and doesn't really fit in with the other four stories in the least . Also since this tale can be seen apart from this film in other places , I'd recommend that rather than sitting through this whole film merely for this one part . Lastly , a tale is told of Nathalie and her ' twin ' , a parasitic worm , whom she has a strong bond with . The saved the worst for last it seemed ( excluding the lame endings to each tale provided at the end of the film ) as this story is trite , boring & uninteresting . The less said of it the better . This sad little anthology concludes with the lame wraparound that can be guessed from the start it's so predictable . Eye Candy : Rachel Veltri gets topless ; Lara Harris provides the T & A DVD Extras : ' filmmakers & cast ' commentary ; 13 & a half minutes of deleted scenes ; the director's cut of ' Staneley's Girlfriend ' ; the original cut of ' girl with golden Breasts ' ; A look inside featurette ( divided into 5 parts ) and trailers for the Midnight Meat Train , Bone Eater , Side Sho , the Bank Job , the Eye , & Rambo
Escape this dreck ( MINOR SPOILER )	A variation of " the most Dangerous Game " set in the future , Australian-style . I'd have ignored the main baddie being named Thatcher , a direct swipe to a then-current political figure in England , if the rest of the movie was entertaining . But it takes 45 minutes to get to the action part & by then , thanks to a werewolf-type creature , you no longer really care . Not the worst movie I ever saw , that would be anything directed or written by Michael Legge , but it's pretty close . DVD Extras : " Turkey Shoot " a featurette on the film ; Director interview ; Director's commentary ; Theatrical trailer ; Alternate opening ; poster & stills gallery ; and DVD-rom readable screenplayEye Candy : Lynda Stoner's ass , extras in shower , Olivia Hussey topless
Stick to courtroom dramas , Mr . Grisham	When Luther and Nora Krank ( Tim Allen and Jamie Curtis respectively ) decide to take a sea cruise in leu of having a Christmas of an kind , in part because their daughter Blair will be in the Peace Corps , their neighbors don't take the news particularly well , which draws the ire of Vic Frohmeyer ( Dan Aykroyd ) the self-proclaimed ' head of the neighborhood ' . A battle of wits ensues ( pardon my laughter , I just never thought I'd go nowhere NEAR typing the word ' wit ' in relation to this movie ) . It's the little things that make this movie not worth watching . Such small nitpicks as Allen and Curtis not having any sort of chemistry whatsoever , and the film not being particularly funny or clever or what have you , but my biggest gripe is that the usually talented John Grisham choose to stray from what he does best ( ie . courtroom dramas ) , but hopefully the mind-blowing travesty that this film is has proved for him not to deviate from his true talent . Where I saw it : Starz on Demand
more isn't always better	Larry Benjamin ( a thinly veiled Lloyd Kaufman , playing more or less himself ) is in the midst of shooting a movie , while all around him ghastly murders are being committed to people associated with the film . All of the " plot " is just a flimsy device to have more blood , guts , bad-taste , vulgarity , and general depravity then even other Troma films never had as much of before , or since thus far . But more doesn't equal better at all , quite the opposite , because while I love other Troma films such as the " Toxic Avenger " films ( well accept for the abysmal third one ) , the first " Class of Nuke ' em high " , " Tromeo and Juliet " and others / This film ( the unrated version at least ) is so extreme , so artless , so offensive that it gave even me pause to wonder what the hell the point of it all was . Note to Lloyd : I NEVER thought I'd say this in my life . But tone it down a notch or two , bro . My Grade : D DVD Extras : Disc 1 ) intro by Llyod ; Lloyd's Commentary ; Editor's commentary ; actor's commentary ; 19 deleted scenes ; 21 alternate takes ; comic to film escalator scene comparison ; audition footage ; blooper reel ; Teaser and theatrical trailers Disc 2 ) the 99 minute " Farts of Dakness : the Making of Terror Firmer " documentary ; 3 music videos ( Say what you mean by Lunachicks , Freak of the Week by DJ Polo with nudity AND Ron Jeremy , and Seeing Red by Entombed ) ; soundtrack spot ; promos for All you need to know about Filmaking , and Tromadance film festival ; Gyno-talk with Alyce Latorelle wherein she talks of how disgusted she was ; a mini interview with Lloyd Kaufman's daughter , Charlotte ; the Radiation March ( the horrid PSA that's on every Troma disk it seems ) , and Trailers for " Citizen Toxie " , " Unspeakable " , " Cannibal the Musical " , & " Parts of the Family " DVD-Rom content : Terror Firmer the game ( I can't get past the " Toddster level , the nails go by to fast ) Easter Eggs : On disc 1 , let the credits under the filmmakers menu play through for a re-creation of a phone call ; highlight the face in the main menu 3 times for a 6 minute censored version of the film . Highlight the Terror Firmer logo in the extras menu for 10 seconds of color bars followed by 10 seconds of a gross appendage ; ( their's another egg , but the link it gives you doesn't work anymore ) Now onto the second disk , highlight the face for footage of " the Naked Cowboy " ( who I've seen at Mardi Gras in New Orleans multiple times )
warmed over overly long episode of the Simpson felt like it could've been on Fox in segments	Matt Groening and company are unmitigated geniuses I tell you . If their plan all along was to make the regular Simpsons TV show and make it progressively more and more awful , such as the case of the series for the last 7 years , and get it to the point of sub-par barely watchable shell of the glory that it once was . And if they did all that JUST to come out with this movie that while never NEVER reaching the classic status of Simpsons yesteryear , yet still much better then the series proper is only to have it viewed as some kind of Oscar-worthy film . Well all I can say is very well played indeed sirs . For those of us that remember how good the series truly was , this bit of fluff involving Homer dooming the the town of Springfield due to his shenanigans , this film was not really made for us and will feel rather repetitive ( IE : Homer and Marge fighting AGAIN , Lisa finding a crush AGAIN , even a few jokes are repeated from the series ) but rather the newer fans who started watching it at the start of this millennium ( yes i know , I shudder at that thought as well ) The fact that this film is currently in the top 100 when it has no business in even IMDb's top 250 is both sad and supremely mind-boggling . But again if one is fed a steady diet of feces and then given a moldy stale pork rind , it'd likely taste like top cuisine .
Why not make it a REAL documentary ? ?	Mark Hammill plays Donald Swan , an elderly comic nerd who attends a con cause he loves Commender Courage ( a made-up creation for the movie ) . If Hamill just made a straight up documentary , this film wouldn't be half as bad . As it is , the jokes are stale , and the guest stars including Kevin Smith , Bruce Campbell , Ray Harryhausen , Stan Lee , and others are pretty much wasted . Which is a damn shame , well not so much in the case of Kevin Smith as he's pretty much a one-trick pony ( as evidence of him trying to get away for said one-trick and making a movie that bombed horribly ) . The extra " behind the voices " featurette on the second disc is better because it's REAL ( why the hell did Miramax see fit to give this sad movie a deluxe set boggles the mind , by the way ) . Mr . Hammill says this move is a ' love letter to the fans ' , proving the saying " you only hurt the one's you love " all the more apt . DVD Extras : Disc 1 ) List of Cameos ; Art gallery ; 13 deleted scenes ; Cast and crew bios ; Trailers for " Spy Kids 3D " and " My Boss's Daughter " Disc 2 ) " Behind the Voices " 51-minute panel ; Faux Extended Interviews with Kevin Smith , Stan Lee , Bruce Campbell , Hugh Hefner , Mark Evanier ; Scott Shaw , Billy Mumy , Peter David , and Paul Dini ; and some other stuff
by now , you know the drill	Can't believe no one used that summery line yet . I'm hilarious . Anyway onto the skimpy plot . A teen and her friends have a ' bitchin ' slumber party . When their boyfriends stop by it's fun fun fun . Well until a killer with a drill bit shows up to menace them . Not the best slasher film I've seen by a long shot , but it does have a certain appeal to undiscriminating b-grade horror fans , myself included . Just not enough to raise it above a slightly below average slasher film . It IS however better then the first film in the franchise .

Dull commercial for suppliers of Atomic energy	Located on the DVD release of " Schlock ! The Secret History of American Movies " this 10 minute short that was made in the ' 60's hawks atomic power like it was going out of style ( well I guess it kinda did ) . Leslie Franzos is the star of the short as she dances around modeling as veteran character actor William Prince narrates his heart out to sell everything atomic . It's extremely dry , but it's an advertisement so it's to be expected . I found it boring though and can't see myself watching it again . Atomic power IS making a comeback pretty soon in the 21st century though , by the way .
The Producer's Cut	After Loomis gives a quick recap of Micheal Myers we flashback to 1989 where Jamie is kidnapped by the Man in Black before the burning police station explodes . Micheal returns to Haddonfeild once again to find Jamie and his baby . In this version the Loomis character gets more scenes and seems much more pro-active than he is in the final cut . The Score is much better , more in line with parts 4 and 5 , none of the electric guitar BS . And the ending makes a tad more sense . For these reasons coupled with the fact that this cut has more characterization and suspense , and cuts back on the gore factor ( Halloween , unlike say the " Friday the 13th " Franschise , was never about blatant gore ) is why I prefer this bootleg Producer's cut . Not to say that the cut magically turns a turd into gold , it just polishes the turd a little bit and makes it more comprehensible . The whole cult plot is still very stupid , as is Micheal fathering a kid My Producer's Cut My Theatrical Cut
could have been good , destroyed by WAY too much spelling it out for stupid people , the ending goes on forever	Jim Carrey decides to go the serious route with the tale of Walter Sparrow ( Carrey ) , whom after finding a book that uncannily mirrors his own life , becomes obsessed with it as well as the number 23 . Virginia Madsen is on hand as his put-upon wife , Agatha . What could have been an intriguing enough movie and solid thriller was sadly hampered with the fact that everything is spelled out slowly and bluntly to the audience whom , one would suspect , the filmmakers seem to believe are slightly mentally retarded and have to be spoon fed from point A to point B like an unthinking lemming . It's extremely insulting to one's intelligence and just sunk the whole film for me . If it weren't for the dumbing down of the film , it would've been good . ( of course it would also be around 45 minutes long ) Eye Candy : Virginia Madsen provides the T &
why bother ? ?	John Constantine ( a supremely lackluster Keanu Reeves ) , is caught between a war with Heaven and Hell after the Spear of Destiny is found . Spear of Destiny and no Nazis to be found ? Blashemy ! How can a film be convoluted and dumbed down at the same time ? But this film succeeds at just that . . If you read the comic " Hellblazer " , DON'T go see this movie . It strips the character of John Constantine of pretty much everything that was cool about him in the first place and anyone would have made a better choice to play him than Keanu Reeves . That said , if you're a fan of Keanu ( which I'm not ) you'll fine this to be passable . For me it was more like " The Prophecy " than anything else . And the last scene is yet another proverbial gut-punch to any of the fans of the comic who actually sat through the whole thing .
acted well enough , but the story is pretty dire	A group of five friends travel to Ireland during their school break vacation in order to do some shrooms in the wilderness along with their Irish friend / mushroom guide . When Tara ( Lindsey Haun ) takes a particularly bad mushroom , she fills her mind with horrific visions of the past and of her friends ' future . A future that will bring death and destruction . It's also a future that will hold boredom , and a wasted hour and a half for those who choose to watch this uninvolving , predictable , agonizingly slow horror flick . The acting is all right , but the scares are just sadly non-existent . Also the ending ( which anyone with half a brain can figure out EARLY in the movie ) is pretty much a direct rip-off of another modern horror film ( no spoilers )
only worth it for R . Lee Ermey & Jack Black in that order	Three lifelong friend who love Neil Diamond , even forming a tribute band , are thrown out of wack when one , Darren Silverman ( Jason Biggs of " American Pie " fame ) , gets pussy whipped by a bitch ( Amanda Peet ) . So it's up to J . D . and Wayne ( Jack Black and Steve Zahn ) to save him from hell . R . Lee Ermey is also on hand for a cameo as the hilariously demented Coach Norton who helps the boys out . In fact him and Jack Black are the only real reasons to watch this dumb corny comedy . I'm sorry Jason Biggs is just not a viable actor ans in all likelihood never will be . DVD Extras : Commentary by Director Dennis Dugan ; Outtakes ; Filmographies ; Theatrical Trailer ; and trailers for " Loser " , " Big Daddy " , " The Cable Guy " , & " Whipped " 2 Easter Eggs : In the " Special Features " menu , highlight " Filmographies " and press right once for more of Jack Black in the eagle costume ; press right twice for a clip of Zahn playing with a raccoon .
starts with promise but runs out of steam	Being a huge Gary Oldman fan , I had high hopes for this film . And the " Deleverence / Straw Dogs " - esquire story about an English couple vacationing at their friends house in a remote part of Spain where they find a poor child locked away in chains and have to face the wraith of local villagers , started off well enough . It had some good atmosphere and it kept my attention , however sadly It seems to run out of steam and lose it's direction somewhere along the way . I felt my interest waning as the story seemed to limp along to an extremely unsatisfying ending ( however at that point I no longer cared ) It IS always cool to see Oldman though . Eye Candy : Virginie Ledoyen & Aitana Sánchez-Gijón both bare all Lion's Gate Region 1 DVD Extras : Trailers for " The Eye " remake , " Retribution " , " Christie's Revenge " , " Dead Man's Bounty " , & " Blood Trails " ; and a promo for Fear . net
the best part of the movie is Natalie Avital , otherwise it's just a case of wasted potential	Sheriff Jack Shephard ( Timothy Murphy ) is in the middle of packing up and leaving town , when a mysterious blood-covered naked boy finds his way into the almost shutdown police station clutching a hunting knife . Now her and his deputies must figure out where the boy came from & what to do with him . The officers seem uncommonly nonchalant given the situations in the film , a small quibble perhaps , but I found that it took me out of the film . Willing to plow on because I found the story intriguing in some small way And it turned out to be a suitable enough time-waster , nothing great , but the ending was really , really bad and the writer / director dropped the ball on that one . Eye Candy : Natalie Avital & Tara Killian both get topless ( but the situations aren't titillating ) ; a lot of naked man ass for the girls
Terminal is fading fast	This Spielberg helmed tale VERY loosely based on the story of Iranian refugee , Merhan Nasseri , has Tom Hanks as Viktor Navorski , stuck in an American airport , rather than a French one ( because if it was set in France , why couldn't have those great jabs at the Department of Homeland Security , right ? ) after his Visa is void thanks to his home country being in a state of upheaval . He must find a way to survive while the evil Homeland Security authority figure attempts to get him out of the airport . The film actually convinced me that it wasn't going to be a pretty good , albeit cute little film . Then the horribly miscast Mrs . Michael Douglas shows up as Viktor's love interest ( cause , hey what good looking woman WOULDN'T want some homeless refugee man-meat ? ) and the film starts it's gradual decline into mediocrity . Hank's acting is great as alway , but everyone else , not so much . And I'm sorry Tom couldn't or shouldn't have to carry a film all by his lonesome . I'm still waiting for Spielberg to make another great movie ( his last one I loved was " Saving Private Ryan ) , but every film since than , has been a major disappointment in one way or another . This one perhaps more so , as the first 15 or 20 minutes showed much promise .
Dead on : do not apply directly to the forehead	Detective Sam Dietz ( Leo Rossi , reprising his role from the first film ) is trying to juggle getting over the attacks on his family from the first film & trying to catch a new serial killer ( Miles O'Keefe ) while teamed up with an unhelpful FBI agent and dealing with a home life that's crumbling around him due to his relentless pursuits of his job . Meg Forster also returns but is relegated to bitching at her husband most of the film . Instead of focusing mostly on the villain like the previous Relentless did , the sequel unwisely chooses to follow Detective Dietz who comes off as a slightly pompous self-loathing windbag . The first film was ( moderately ) entertaining strictly because of Judd Nelson's dead-eyed portrayal of that films killer ( and William Lustigs direction to a lesser extent ) Where as this film gives Miles O'Keeffe's Gregor , the stone cold killer ( who could've been a great character , the back story was intriguing enough ) the short shift , and while this sequel is still somewhat watchable , it is definitely the lesser because of it . DVD Extras : Trailers for In The Cut , Secret Window & Panic Room
these remains turn out to be merely table scraps	Mark , a graduate student is working on a major tome on myths , and after interviewing the psychiatrist ( the great Kurtwood Smith in an awkward little bit part near the beginning and end ) who was treating Carl Bryce , a boy who brutally murdered his parents , decides to go on a road trip to the site where it all happened on the chance that the land there might be cursed , an urban myth that would help with his book . Once there with a few friends in tow , they discover that they may not be alone in this generic & bland slasher film . While the opening ' prolog ' scene showed promise for the rest of the film , I found my hopes quickly dashed as it turned out highly derivative and had characters who talk and yell to no end that were bland and hard to care about . Yea there's a good scene here and there in the film . But the movie as a whole just failed to work for me . Thankfully I just saw it via Netflix-online view so the only thing I really waisted was my time .
Watchable in spite of Tweety	Sylvester cat is in a forest park . He finds an egg that he decides to sit on an hatch , but the egg contains one Tweety bird . And the chase is on once more . The poor cat also has to deal with the park ranger . I inward cringe whenever Tweety opens his mouth or especially sings , I have no clue why , I just really don't like the voice . The cartoon is alright I guess , but NOT because of Tweety , but rather in spite of him . And I have to get through a few more Tweety cartoons . Joy rolls eyes This animated short can be seen on Disc 3 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 2 and also features an optional Music & effects only track .
Campy but horribly dated	Ginger ( Cheri Caffero ) is back once again infiltrating a kidnapping racket ( apparently no one cared that she was a racist sociopath in the first one ) . Better than the first film , " Ginger " , but what the hell could be worse ? ? ? So that's not a selling point . Most of the girls have breast so small they could pass for boy scouts . So nothing to rave about there . The only quasi-good looking one of the bunch is Jennifer Brooks . Gone are the racism elements . But it wouldn't be a Ginger film without the light S & M scenes . Don't get me wrong , this one is still crap , just crap that's not as repellent as the original . Eye Candy : Cheri Caffero , Gerie Bronson , Honey Well , Ined Som , Jennifer Brooks , and Jeremie Rain show breasts and bush
the worst Dalek story ever told	Sadly the second half of a story that shouldn't have been told in even one episode isn't that better then the first . The same flaws that plague the previous " Daleks in Manhatten " are present here as well . Horrid acting by the guest stars ( luckily some of those over-acted characters die ) , a flawed storyline , shoddy characterization . All these elements combine to make this pretty much the worst Dalek-centered episode in . . . well ever . Tis a pity it marred an otherwise great 29th series thus far . If future appearances will be like this perhaps it's time to put the Dalekanium encrusted ones on ice for the foreseeable future .
much ado about nothing	A group of rebellious kids find themselves in over their heads when one of their gang accidentally hits a man with the bike they stole . The man , Peter ( Kevin Howarth , The Last Horror Film , Razor Blade Smile ) at first seeming friendly to the gang , has more sinister motivations . I found myself engaged with the film up to a point and Howarth brings a fairly good performance , but the kids , as hooligans , aren't really that likable ( not to say that the situation they find themselves in isn't tense , it is ) But that coupled with an ending that seemed rushed and a tad bit anti-climatic made the film seem less then the sum of it's parts . Sadly this one is a well-intentioned misfire . DVD Extras : Director's commentary ; A 30 minute Making-of feature ; Stills gallery ; Original trailer for this film ; and trailers for " Dante's Inferno " , " Hell's Ground " , " Pistoleros " , & " the Living and the Gead "
these birds aren't that much of a ' tweet '	A posse of 6 Confederate outlaws rob a bank of some gold bars during the American Civil War . They hole up in an abandoned mansion where strange happenings abound and the house's macabre history turn things tense between the outlaws . After a very promising start ( but aren't they are ? ) This one gradually sinks firmly into mediocrity . Not a bad film per say , just one that you've seem many many times before . Not enough scares , not enough tension . All the accolades gave me false hope that this would be a very good tension filled film , needless to say I couldn't help but be disappointed .
not as good as the first , but still worthwhile	56 more vintage trailers are in this sequel compilation to the first 42nd Street Forever ( which I loved , by the way ) . This time around the focus is mainly on racing films , blacksploitation , a few swords & sandals flicks among others . Even though this began with a great trailer for the classic Ms . 45 and has a few other gems here & there , it pales in comparison to volume 1 which really upped the anti as far as trailer comps go . This is still watchable , but in my opinion , just lacked that special something . Also there's way less nudity and rampant violence in this set ( although both still there )
Formalic but charming in it's way	After Danny and Wheeler ( Paul Rudd & Sean William Scott respectively ) must do some community service in a Big Brother-type program or face jail time for destruction of property while hopped up on energy drinks , they meet the two kids they're paired up with uber-geek , Augie ( Christopher Mintz-Plasse of " Superbad " fame ) & foul-mouthed , perpetually horny Ronnie ( Bobbie Thompson ) . At first highly skeptical , the duo soon realize that they can learn from their court-mandated ' kids ' as vice versa . The film moves at a brisk enough pace , and while never hilarious , it has it's moments and is a bit better then the trailer would lead you to believe despite an utterly predictable story-line . Highly forgettable but a good enough comedy for a rainy Saturday afternoon . Eye Candy : Carly Craig & Jessica Morris both get topless
if this is a " cult classic " , I don't want to join the cult	A bickering , littering couple go on a camping trip , they commit the cardinal sin of a certain section of horror films from the 1970's : They don't treat nature with respect ( oh nos ! ! ! ! ! ) . The last 20-25 minutes or so are pretty good , the problem is sitting through what comes before . I don't care if it's well-acted or not , when one goes in expecting a horror film and gets a trite morality play with unlikable protagonists , one will be let down . Perhaps this fault lies in how the movie was packaged and sold . But regardless of the marketing or not , if I wanted to watch middle-aged bickering couples that I could care less about , I'd be watching " Thirtysomething " Eye Candy : Briony Behets gets topless My Grade : DVD Extras : Commentary with Producer Richard Brennan and Cinematographer Vincent Monton ; Stills Gallery with an audio interview with actor John Hargreaves ; and Theatrical Trailer
could of been better , could have been worse	Two convicts Joe Blake and Terry Collins ( Bruce Willis and Billy Bob Thorton , respectively ) , break out of prison only to go on to become infamous as the ' Sleepover Bandits ' , for the methods they use to rob banks , which is keeping the bank managers in their houses , spending the night , and going with the manager in the morning to get the bank loot . Things get complicated when a desperate housewife ( Cate Blanchett ) decide to runaway with them . creating a twisted little love triangle and sexual tensions between the felons . Sometimes when one feels develops a favorite actor ( in this case me for Bruce Willis ) , one feels compelled to watch every movie said actor stars in . At times that can bite someone in the ass , such is the case with this film . Bruce's performance is actually good , but the hypochondriac tendencies of Billy Bob's character tend to get old REAL fast , and at over 2 hours that's a long time to spend with an annoying character . He brings the whole movie down . Not to say this film is completely unworthwhile , as there are some very choice parts , Just that the bad ultimately outweighs the good , and you're likely to keep glancing at your watch in a vain attempt to make the film end faster . DVD Extras : 20 minutes " Inside Bandits " featurette ; Script To Screen ; Who's The Dad ?

fails in comparison to any other batman animated movie	Edited from 3 episodes of " The New Batman Superman Adventures " , this cartoon has Lex Luther accepting the Joker's offer to defeat Superman for him . But Batman follows his arch-nemeses to Metropolis and finds himself teaming up with Superman to take these two villains down . I was a huge fan of " Batman : The Animated Series " , but found Superman's subsequent series to be lackluster at best . So this is a halfway decent film , namely the Batman half ( Well it's not really a half , as Superman hogs up most of the running time ) . Overall the film is the weakest of any of the animated Batman films Doesn't help that the story is mediocre as best . DVD Extras : Cast & Crew Information ; " The Joker's Challenge " game ; Conversation with Producer Bruce Timm ; How To Draw Batman & Superman featurettes ; The Art Of Batman featurette ; Music Montage ; Theatrical Trailer ; and Trailers for " Batman Beyond : Return of the Joker " , " Batman & Mr .

Billy Snow and Gedde Watanabe make it watchable	Keith and Vic are two fraternity pledges who go to town to look for some ladies of the night for their frat . Seeing as neither have a car they have to borrow Duncan's ( 80's staple Asian go to guy , Gedde Watanabe ) . He obviously pleads to go along with them . They find themselves in a bar owned and run by vampires , a stripping vampire queen ( Grace Jones ) , and Billy Drago as an albino gang leader , not in that order . The best parts of this film revolve around Billy Snow and Gedde Watanabe . I'm not really a fan of Grace Jones and always blamed her somewhat for " Conan the Destroyer being as bad as it was . So her scenes did nothing for me . But overall the film is a pretty fun time waster , if nothing else . Eye Candy : Tricia Burns as Candy gets topless DVD Extras : Commentary by Director Richard Wenk , and actors Chris Makepeace , Dedee Pfeiffer , & Gedde Watanabe ; " Dracula Bites the Big Apple 22 minute short film ; Poster & Stills gallery ; Rehearsal footage ; Blooper reel ; 7 TV spots ; and 2 Theatrical Trailers
enjoyable but nothing special	When he's not busy destroying the Batman franchise , Joel Schumacher is capable of making moderately entertaining films . This one about a New York publicist trapped in a phone booth by an unknown sniper depends on how much you like Colin Farrell as an actor for how much millage you can take from it . I , myself enjoy Collin's work so I enjoyed this film . Not tremendously enjoyed , but enjoyed all the same . I found it to be taunt and a bit suspenseful thanks in no small part to Larry Cohen's writing . That guy hugely under-rated . But the ending is what marred the whole film for me . DVD Extras : Commentary by Joel Schumacher ; Theatrical Trailer ; Trailer for Garage Days
weird curiosity	Peter Crane ( Jorge Rivero , star of the later " Conquest " ) is a rich womanizing playboy who suffers from a string of vivid nightmares . Peter may or may not also be a murderer in this strange , off-beat , and wildly disjointed Grindhouse curiosity . While a tad hard to follow simply for the logic ( or rather lack of ) , the movie is strangely compelling none the less and is probably best viewed as a product of a bygone era . It more than made up for the sheer tedium that I had experienced when I sat through the previous " Black Candles " skin-flick fiasco . Region 1 DVD Extras : Trailers for " Pick Up " , " Legend of Eight Samurai " , " Don't Answer the Phone " , " Prime Evil " , & " Sister Street Fighter " ( also the same DVD holds a second feature movie " Black Candles " )
Going off on a rant	A down-on-his-luck guy ( Peter North ) remembers how he became a roadie for a rock band that would be much better if they played more then the skin flute . I don't want to go off on a rant here , but , I sincerely think that people over-inflate most Traci Lords movies just because they know others can't watch them nowadays . A lot of Traci's output isn't as great as you're led to believe and I'm more pi$$ed at her for making the movies of her co-stars disappear from the entertainment lexicon forever , most notably those of Christy Canyon . Who isn't in this one , but had co-starred with Tracy a lot back in the day . That being said this one is pretty good and has a scene with Tracy using some drumsticks that IS pretty hot . I just think shes way too overrated for the most part . My Porn
" she must be a slut , look at those dark nipples "	overly endowed Samurai who doesn't take sh ^ # from anyone is back in the sequel to " Sword of Justice " . Hanzo ' The Razor ' Itami ( Shintarô Katsu , best known for the Zatôichi films ) returns with his two ex-con assistants to kick more ass , rape more women , train his penis more , more corrupt government officials , and generally do away with more evil doers . This one adds demonic abortions , S & M clubs , and the best looking bald chick this side of Lt . Uhura . A bit more perverse and a lot more violent , this film as well as the whole trilogy is only recommended for the more adventurous , but if you approach it with an open mind you will NOT be disappointed . NOT for the PC crowd , and all the better because of that . But sometimes more is less . The film feels more like a retread in spot , and not as good as the original or the third one , but still watchable , even if it's the worst of the series . DVD Extras : Merely Trailers for all 3 Hanzo the Razor films Eye Candy : 18 breasts . 1 ass
Slightly above average	A photographer is walking down the beach on the edge of Potter's Bluff , he sees a beautiful girl willing and eager to be photographed . He seems to be smitten with her , until some local town folk tie him up and burn him alive . When the same mentioned guy turns up in Potter's Bluff proper , none the worse for wear , it doesn't sit well with local Sheriff Gillis ( James Farentino ) . As for starts examining other grisly murders , he can't help but feel they're connected somehow , even if he doesn't quite fanthom the extant . This is a rather moody thriller hampered by some ineffective gore scenes ( some of them are effective , though ) , some big loopholes , and an unsatisfying ending . But all in all I liked the film . The musical score is effective in setting the mood . Nominated for a Saturn Award for best movie in 1982 , but the honor went rightfully to " An American Werewolf in London " ( How the Awful " Wolfen " even got nominated that same year , I haven't a clue ) ( My Limited Edition # is 32560 , in case anyone gives a hoot ) 2-Disk Blue Underground Limited Edition DVD Extras : Disk 1 ) Commentary with Gary A .

better than expected	Dougie , a less then mentally stable 9 year old , is heavily into a video game entitled ' Satan's Little Helper ' , so much so that when he spies a murderer in a devil costume he hardly bats an eye before asking to be his minion and asking if his new ' friend ' can kill his sister's new boyfriend ( Dougie wants to marry his sister himself , but that's neither here nor there ) . Things soon spiral horribly out of control , as they are apt to do in these scenarios . I haven't been too kind to ol ' Jeff Lieberman in the past , I haven't enjoyed his films since " Blue Sunshine " & have on one occasion even drew the ire of the man himself who wrote to me on here . But with that said , I have to give kudos to a film when I feel that it warrants them and I did find this film does just that . Yes it's silly , but it's still likable in it's own demented way ( until it starts to lose steam a tad in the final act ) Joshua Annex steals the movie as the main baddie not even having to say a word , the rest of the cast , including a bizarre acting turn by Amanda Plummer , fare not so well ( but again that's not a real slight against the film , as that's a small part of the charm ) All in all it's a perfectly capable small black comedic horror film .

Cabbage love	In this 7 minute multiple award-winning short from the UK , Stanley , a weather-worn old man has only the cabbage growing in his backyard to give him joy . His wife growing jealous of the lack of attention , fixes to make some cabbage stew . Suzie Templeton shows promise , and given that this is basically just a student film , I'm liable to overlook the short's flaws . And in all honesty , the good things of the film do out way the bad . Let me take the remaining time alloted to rail against the 10-line minimum IMDb has dictated and say it shouldn't apply to shorts less then 10 or even 15 minutes long . My Short
not one of my faves	Tom the cat wants the house's pet goldfish for a new recipe that he's just heard about on the radio . But Jerry the mouse doesn't want to have his beloved goldfish being eaten by Tom , so he goes about saving it from Tom's many schemes to fry it . This isn't one of my preferred Tom & Jery shorts , as I didn't really care for the fish . But a lot of the gags do work well . That said , even not so great Tom and Jerry shorts are a million times better then the sugar coated homogenized crap that passes for kid's cartoons now a days This cartoon can be found on disc two of the Spotlight collection DVD of " Tom & Jerry "
Mick Cain ruined this one for me somewhat	A family and the daughter's boyfriend is on a drive to visit their mom's parents house , when the father ( superb Ray ' Leland Palmer ' Wise ) decides to take some back roads . When they pick up a mysterious lady in white ( the stunning , Amber Smith ) and leave the daughter behind to catch up , all hell seems to break lose . The uber-annoying son ( Mick Cain ) who listens to Marilyn Manson making homophobic remarks tended to strike me as a bit queer ( no pun intended ) . Speaking of the son , he was the main reason that I didn't find this film as good as I should have . But it does have a few effective scares , none the less , even if you do have to dodge a few plot holes . Eye Candy : only Amber Smith's backside
no sleeping here	All Tom the cat want's to do is get a little catnap in the hammock of his , but Jerry the mouse is using it himself . The typical cat and mouse game ensues with many funny gags , the short also features Spike the dog . Do you guys know how hard it is for someone to continuously review these ( or any short or featurette ) when there's a 10 line requirement ? I'd wager that has something to do with not many comments being found for one-reelers which is a shame , but I digress . This hilarious classic cartoon can be found on disc two of the Spotlight collection DVD of " Tom & Jerry "
unrequited love and swastika hearts	Mark nags Jeremy to get a job in the office that he works at so that Jeremy can help with the rent , however Jeremy is more content with his aspiring music career and silly pyramid schemes to take an actual job interview seriously . Meanwhile Mark is fawning over co-worker , Sophie . This second episode wasn't quite as good as the pilot in my eyes . But only by a hair , as it's still quite very funny stuff . I'm starting to see why the series seems so beloved by those across the pond . Even the minor gripe that the constant voice-overs might take a bit getting used to is a non-issue by even just the second show in .
Road Runner is taking a bit more sadistic pleasure in his pursuers misfortune	The eleventh pairing of Wile E . Coyote and the Road Runner has the ever-determined coyote using the same unreliable methods against the ever-elusive bird , who seems a bit sadistic in this one . The bee gags is funny and even the now predictable gags still bought a smile to my face . And I , as always with these cartoons , found it highly enjoyable , but perhaps I'm a bit biased as Wile E . Coyote is one of my absolute favorite cartoon personalities of all time . This animated short can be seen on Disc 2 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 2 . This cartoon also has an optional music only track .
junk food cinema	Writer / Director Wayne Kramer , who made the fantastic " The Cooler " , returns with a movie that , while being a different animal indeed , is almost as enjoyable albeit in a vastly different way . Paul Walker is Joey Gazalle a mob thug who has to make a mad dash all around the cities of Jersey with his kid Nicky in tow trying to find Nicky's friend , Olav , whom had stolen a gun from Joey . A gun that happens to be hot and one that killed a dirty cop , so the surviving cop as well as Olav's abusive father , and a Russian mob boss are keen on finding the gun as well . You know what the plot doesn't really matter and the films gets so off the wall that a simple synapses wouldn't do it justice anyway . Just know that the movie is all style over substance , but man what style . this is the best example of junk food cinema that I've seen in the past few years . Blood , gun-play , action , and all at a quick clip that the film never has time to catch it breath , much less to become dull . Even if the ' revelation ' towards the end is a bit retarded ( and everything after said revelation at the end of the roller rink scene progressively gets worse and worse leading to a simply horrid ending ) . But everything up to that point is great . Eye Candy : Vera Farmiga shows a hint of bush , and numerous extras show various amounts of skin in a strip club scene DVD Extras : Commentary by director Wayne Kramer ; an 18 minute ' Making of ' ; storyboard sequences ; Theatrical trailer ; and trailers for the new " Blade " TV show , " Firewall " ; " Cyber Wars ' , " Puerto Vallarta Squeeze " , " Final Destination 3 " , " the Year of the Yao " , & " A History of Violence " ( inside the DVD case you can also find a mini-comic ) DVD-ROM content : Script-to-Screen
not as good as " Kitty Foiled "	Jerry the mouse helps his old friend the canary ( from the great " Kitty Foiled " ) that Tom the cat is trying to capture for dinner . Tom tries in vain to get the bird , even going so far as to make a pair of wings for himself to soar at the birds level . A few funny gags highlight this animated short , but it's just not as good as the previously mentioned " Kitty Foiled " . I can't seem to put my finger on just why though . But this film is still funny and very much worth your time . This hilarious classic cartoon can be found on disc two of the Spotlight collection DVD of " Tom & Jerry "
Some repeated gags , some new ones , still VERY watchable	Starting off with the Road Runner interrupting the crafty coyote's meal , the seventh pairing of Wile E . Coyote and the Road Runner has a few gags repeated from the earlier shorts which while old still made me chuckle , but it has a few new ones as well that made me laugh . And as always ANY short with Wile E . in it is so VERY much worth watching , as he's one of my absolute favorite cartoon personalities of all time . This animated short can be seen on Disc 2 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 2 . This cartoon also has an optional music only track .
interesting if not arousing	A collection of early shorts ( a combination of old stag films , vintage shorts , cartoons , and films made for the Penny Arcades ) is narrated ( seldomly ) by an unknown voice over guy in this documentary / Compilation piece by Alex De Renzy , who himself would go on to become a highly regard porn director ( his best stuff being made in the late 70's and much of the ' 80's . The film is interesting if only to see how much porn advanced in some ways , but didn't at all in others . There's nothing to really get aroused to in here , but if you ever were interested in how it all got started , then this will have you fascinated to no end . ( well except for some of the filler )
weird but fun	A creepy , murderous kid listening to his demonic teddy bear lures various people to their doom in a pit he found in the woods ; that is when he's not spying on older women in this weird but campy classic from the ' 80's . Filled with unnecessary close-ups , ridiculous laugh-out-loud dialog , and hokey acting , this oddity still remains constantly amusing ( well truth be told it does lose steam about 20 minutes before the ending ) That remains an obscure gem that's highly watchable . Eye Candy : Jeannie Elias , Laura Hollingsworth , and Jennifer Lehman all get topless briefly Anchor Bay DVD Extras : Posters & Stills gallery ( on a double-bill with " Hellgate " on this flip-side DVD )
Jerry's Uncle	Jerry the mouse's guitar playing Uncle Peco from Texas comes to spend the night with him before he goes for his big debut on national TV . When his guitar string breaks he just plucks the whiskey of Tom the cat . This happens multiple times . Yea it's pretty much a one-joke premise , but it's pretty entertaining none the less . Perhaps not the best of the tom and jerry shorts , but I enjoyed it enough . Someone should post the lyrics to Peco's song LOL This humorous animated short can be found on disc 2 of Warner Brother's 2-DVD Spotlight Collection set .
Whoa mama	Pam Grier and Margaret Markov are the Black Mama and White Mama respectively , Two escapees from a womens ' prison , in this exploitation flick . Actually pretty good in a B-movie way . It's not Jonathan Demme's best writing credit ( that would be Caged Heat ) , and not Pam Grier's best movie ( or 5th best movie . . . or 10th best movie . . or even . . well you get the gist ) , but it IS Margaret Markov's best film AND it does have Sid Haig ( who's good in anything , pretty much the ONLY actor i liked in that " House of 1 , 000 Corpses " travesty ) My Rating : B-Eye Candy : shower scene , Pam & Margaret topless in the " hot box " , Various hookers , & a 3-wayWhere i saw it : TMC Extra
a lesser known Stephan chow movie	After forty years of running his coffee shop , Mr . Li ( Man Tat Ng of " God of Gamblers " , " Shoalin Soccer " , and " God of Cookery " , among others ) gets the news that his lease is about to expire and his rent is going to be raised exponentially . Li needs to find a way to get the money . That main plot is intertwined with three romantic subplots : one involving Stephan Chow as Sui , " Prince of egg tarts " , whom everyone goes to for advice , put's on an act that makes him look like a ladies man , and may have met his match in Candy Yip ( acting and singing star , Sammi Cheng ) a girl he wronged in the past , another between Li's son , Nam & Fon Fon , a girl who tells Li that she's engaged to Nam in order to avoid loan sharks , and the third with a delivery boy trying to woo Fanny , a secretary at a karate school . While this film isn't as off-beat , frantically paced , or sheerly madcap as Stephan Chows more well known films ( " God of Cookery " , " fight Back to school " , " Kung Fu Hustle " , etcetera . . . ) , it's still a fun little film . All of the main characters are fairly well fleshed out , likable , and well acted . And while the plot is hardly anything new , in fact fairly generic . It's heart is in the right place and there are enough laughs throughout to make it worthy for a watch with a loved one .
you have the right to remain in hysterics	Liutenent Frank Drebin ( Leslie Neilson ) has to foil a plot by Ricardo Montalban to assassinate Queen Elizabeth the second . But c'Mon the plot doesn't really matter . All you need to know is this was a movie version of the " police Squad " show and that it was made by the team of Zucker / Abrahams / Zucker in their heyday . Which means non-stop sight gags and slapstick from beginning to end at breakneck speed with nary a time to catch your breath . This movie is hilarious and for you kids who only know " Scary Movie 3 " , you have no clue how truly hilarious these guys can be . Rent this , " Airplane " and " Top Secret " for a night of non-stop laughter . You can thank me in the morning . My Grade : DVD Extras : Commentary with David Zucker , Robert Weiss , and Peter Tilden ; and Theatrical trailer ( it would have been nice if they included deleted or the extended TV scenes ) Eye Candy : A random girl's ass in the beginning credits
a great honest heartfelt movie	Joel ( Jim Carrey ) is heartbroken when he finds out , via finding a telegram mailed to a mutual friend , that his girlfriend , Clementine ( Kate Winslet ) , in a moment of supreme anger and frustration , went to have a procedure to have all of her memories of him wiped clean . So he decides to do the same thing , only realizing while the process is going on that he truly doesn't want to forget her . This is a beautiful film dealing with love , loss , grief , acceptance , anger , and the shades in between , that I almost gave up on watching ( I tried to get into it before , but due to the unbearable slowness of the beginning I had turned off a little after the opening credits rolled ) . I'm so very glad that I gave it another chance , as I found it to be an extremely heartfelt , honest , and rewarding film . All the performances are pretty much spot-on and this is without a doubt Jim Carrey's best performance ever in a film , hands down . I truly can't fathom why a lot of viewers found this movie to be hard to comprehend , as I found the movie pretty straight forward in it's simplicity , despite the roundabout way it choose to present itself . DVD Extras : Disc 1 ) Commentary by director Michel Gondry and writer Charlie Kaufman ; " A Look Inside ' Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind ' " featurette ; " A Conversation with Jim Carrey and Director Michel Gondry " ; 7 minutes of Deleted scenes ; Polyphonic Spree " Light & Day " Music Video ; fake Lacuna commercial ; Promo for Focus Pictures ; Trailers for " Vanity Fair " , and " The Motercycle Diaries " Disc 2 ) 20 minute " Inside the Mind of Michel Gondry " featurette ; 17 minute " Anatomy of a Scene : Saratoga Avenue " featurette ; A Conversation with Kate Winslet and director Michel Gondry ; and more Deleted / Extended Scenes Random notes : Also comes with a 28 page booklet
Bugs Fudd	Elmer Fudd and Bugs Bunny find themselves as each other thanks to Elmer's faulty attempt to hypnotize Bugs . I found this cartoon to be clever and funny for the most part and the change between the personalities of the two main characters was interesting . I didn't really care for the ending as it just seemed that the powers that be told Friz to wrap it up to keep the length of the short to a lean 7 minutes even and it seemed like a non-ending more than anything else . But overall I did enjoy this one a lot . This animated short can be seen on Disc 1 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 2 .
The last of Hubie and Bertie	Mice Hubie and Bertie , tired of eating cheese all day , wish to end it all by suicide via Claude Cat eating them . But Claude doesn't want to eat another mouse as long as he lives and the prospect wants him want to attempt suicide via a dog eating him . The dog is reasonable perplexed & a little bit scared in this very funny cartoon . The last of the six shorts that Hubie and Bertie starred in and probably for the best as where do you go after the insanity of this ? ? This animated short can be seen on Disc 2 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 2 .
funny enough	The usual cat and mouse antics abound until Jerry jumps into a bottle of invisible ink . He gets the bright idea of torturing Tom without him knowing . The cat gets wise and tries to do stuff to make him ' see ' jerry even if it's not fool-proof . Of course Jerry gets Butch aka Killer aka Spike the dog into the act ( even if it's late in the short , and his contribution is minimal indeed ) Brilliant animated short which kind of reminded me of the one with the white mouse who scares Tom so badly . Most of the gags work and all violent as any good tom and jerry short should truly be . This hilarious cartoon can be found on disc one of the Spotlight collection DVD of " Tom & Jerry "
Better then the first	This sequel to the first " Black Angel " can be watched without any prior knowledge to the first as the only connection they share is different hit-women who take the moniker of the Black Angel . Mayo , the Black Angel in this film , has orders from cross-dressing Mama ( Shingo Tsurumi from " Freeze Me " ) to kill a powerful Yakuza syndicate leader , but doesn't get the job done because one of his bodyguards is the same man who saved her from a rape years prior , whom she has feelings for . This exceeds Black Angel 1 by leaps and bounds , with great characterization and an intriguing captivating plot . DVD Extras : Trailers for " Zero Woman " , " Wild Criminal " , " Score " , and " Gonin 2 "
nice heartfelt little film	This modestly budgeted coming-of-age film succeeds in impressing due in no small part by the young , but genuinely good acting by Will Poulter and to a slightly less effect ( but still good ) Bill Milner . I was able to avoid the hype of this little film and as such didn't have huge expectations from it , this helped me to enjoy it all the more . If you enjoyed old John Hughes films , you'll find much to like in this heart-felt one . DVD Extras : Commentary with Garth Jennings , Nick Goldsmith , Bill Milner , & Will Poulter ; a 26-minute Making-of ; Garth's short film " Aron " ; Son of Rambow website winner ; and Trailers for " American Teen " , " the Duchess " , " the Love Guru " , " Shine A Light " , & " Drillbit Taylor "
crying takes the sad out of you	John Lyshitski ( Dax Shepard ) is a young guy who's spent most of his life in prison , blaming the judge who continuously sent him them , he hatches his plan for revenge . But he dies three days before he gets free of prison , so John decides to go after the judge's son , Nelson ( Will Arnet of brilliant " Arrested Development " fame ) John's plan is to frame Nelson , get him sent to jail , and then get himself sent to the same jail to bunk with him , which he accomplishes . But things don't always go as planned afterwords though . Personally I found this film hilarious and don't really know why there's all this hatred towards it . Will Arnet is pretty funny and Dax Shepard plays off him quite well . But the REAL star of the film is Chi McBride as Barry , an eloquent rapist . Whenever he's on the screen it had me in stitches . The film's not as good as Mr . Show was ( but hell what can be ? ) But director Bob Odenkirk still has a winner here .
Is Hasselholff-ploitation a word ? ? It SHOULD be	Old & future TV stars collide in this bizzare sex-ploitation flick . Carl Ballantine from McHale's Navy , Mike Steele from The Rockford Files , and Regina Gleason from Days of our Lives show up . But David Hasselholff as a guy named " Boner " with his seizure-like spastic dance moves is the most ridiculous . Highlights ( or lowlights depending on your view ) include the aforementioned dancing , permasian cheese snorting , a food fight that goes on forever , and seeing the same dinosuars from Pee-Wee's big adventure . Over-the-top to say the least , but with a six-pack in hand it's oddly enjoyable . Kind of a guilty pleasure akin to Clue . The Dvd in Anchor Bay's Cheerleaders Collection ( The Cheerleaders , Revenge of the Cheerleaders , & the Swinging Cheerleaders ) is presented uncut . DVD Extras : Ex-cheerleader commentary ( TOO sarcastic ) ; Still gallery ; 3 Radio spots ; an 8 minute behind the scenes featurette ; 2 theatrical trailers ; and a TV spotEye Candy : both female & to a lesser extant male naughty bits are in view
for the most part hilarious , if extremely base	Sacha Baron Cohen finally sees the success that he certainly didn't attain with his previous " Ali G Indahouse " . Now when I use the term success , I mean in the world-wide term , as I'm quite aware he's been well known over the pond for awhile now and has enjoyed cult status in the States for a bit . However with the release of this film , he's a bonafide star overnight ( well his alter-ego Borat is anyway ) & with good reason as this mockumentary about a naive ridiculously bigoted , offensive foreign documentarian , Borat , touring America in hopes of wedding Pamala Anderson , of Baywatch fame , is utterly hilarious . Every time he interacts with everyday people it caused me to laugh and brought a smile to my face . The only thing that detracted from the experience of watching the film is that at one point it turned into very nervous laughter and I had to look away from the screen . ( yeah , yeah , call me a prude . But if you went to see this film in theaters with other members of your family , you'd be just as embarrassed ) . Other than that , the film was the most i laughed in while watching a movie in quite some time . True the movie is pretty basic and not subtle in the least , true it doesn't paint Americans in the best of lights . But I found it a pretty damn good film , none the less
final entry	Shintarô Katsu , best known for the Zatôichi films , again stars in this third and final movie in the Kenji Misumi ( mostly known for " Lone Wolf and Cub ) , directed saga of Hanzo ' The Razor ' Itami feature the big dicked one battling ninjas , rapeing ' ghosts ' , and uncovering shady goings on at the Shogunate treasury . The Hanzo ' plot ' was kinda getting stale and repetitive . What was once novel in the first film , was not any longer . Fortunately , this one was better then the second thanks to having more humor . I'm just glad that they choose to stop at the one trilogy ( I'm looking at YOU Lucas ) DVD Extras : Merely Trailers for all 3 Hanzo the Razor films Eye Candy : Aoi Nakajima unleashes both tits , Mako Midori just her left one
a fun making of / Retrospective	This Retrospective Making of featurette on " Halloween 4 " can be found as an extra on the special edition DVD of the aforementioned movie . It runs just under 17 minutes and deals with the fruition of the back to basics approach to the story , the race against time to get a script ready before the writer's strike , the casting , and the tribulations . Featuring interviews with all the main crew , and actresses Danielle Harris ( who has grown up to be quite the hotty ) and Ellie Cornell , as well as the guy who played Micheal Myers . I enjoyed this little feauterette a lot . It just had a fun feel to it .
gnarly , fur suhr	Hollyweird spazes Randy and his friend like totally crash Suzy's tubular party . Julie falls for Randy . Her gnarly friends think that's like so totally gross , fur sure . OK , enough of that silliness . This is basically a Romeo and Juliet love story set in the San Fernando Valley of the ' 80's . The fact is that despite the cookie cutter characterization , this is a cute little movie , thanks in no small part due to Nicolas Cage's great performance . Elizabeth Daily is cute and all but when I saw her topless and talking , I kept picturing Tommy Pickles from " Rugrats " . It was just weird . DVD Extras : Commentary with Martha Coolidge ; Video commentary track ; 80's nostalgia and trivia track ; " Valley Girl : 20 Years later " featurette ( 24 minutes ) ; " In Conversation " Nicolas Cage and Martha Coolidge " featurette ( 20 minutes ) ; " The music of Valley Girl " ( 15 minutes ) ; 2 music videos ; and 3 Storyboard to film comparisons Easter Eggs : 4 on the Special Features page ( highlight three of the hearts for translations of " Vally Talk " , highlight the jogging man for a tour of the locations ) Eye Candy : Elizabeth Daily , Michelle Meyrink , and Tina Theberge all get topless
pretty good	This 1 hour 18 minute feature length documentary can be found on Anchor Bay's Commemorative 2-DVD set of the movie " The Osterman Weekend " . It features interviews with pretty much every cast and crew member still living ( barring Dennis Hopper for some unknown reason ) . Casting , pre-production , production , post are all covered here . As well as Sam Packinpah's troubles . But it's a testimony to the acclaimed director that he got the cast merely because it was him doing it . It's all pretty interesting and informative , and it's always nice to hear from Rutger Hauer . Not as good as say " Full Tilt Boogie " but movie documentaries rarely are .
The Cure's Killing an Arab , Norris-style	Made in a time long far gone , a time when the movies & other media actually depicted middle-easterners as capable of terrorism shock , horror as opposed to today's overly sensitive emasculated world ( the white-washing of " Sum of all Fears " , the main villains in 24 NEVER being a ethnicity , etcetera ) , comes this great little film loosely based on the TWA 847 hijacking of 1985 . Chuck Norris and Lee Marvin are part of an elite military squad who are sent after the terrorists and free the hostages . And yes I know having a whole squad , when you already have Chuck Norris DOES stretch credibility quite a bit . The movie plays out as one half melodrama with the hostages ordeal and one half silly little action romp ( complete with missile launching motor cycle , and no it doesn't make sense even it the concept of the movie , but it's still bad ass ) I enjoyed the film and was more then happy to see the terrorists get their just desserts . If it were remade today it would delve into how the terrorists feel and how we made them cause the USA is truly evil . Or other supreme nonsense . The days when anyone could say ' the only good terrorist is a dead terrorist ' and NOT be tarred and feathered for saying it are sadly over . The hippies won that war . But we still have great movies like this to fondly remember and re-watch while Hollywood churns out awful dreck today .
great antics	Tom the cat has got Jerry the mouse on a fishing line and is toying with him much to Jerry's chagrin . So after he gets away he runs into a cat that scares Tom . Jerry think he's saved onto to realize that the second cat just wants to eat him himself . What follows is classic slapstick as the two cats fight over who gets the meal . But they both get their just desserts in the end . Tom and Jerry are in their top form here and are a delight to watch as they ALMOST are ( the feature film where they're best pals is horrid , but I digress ) . This hilarious cartoon can be found on disc one of the Spotlight collection DVD of " Tom & Jerry "
a campy porn classic	Barbra the Barbarian ( Barbara Dare ) is overthrown as leader to a tribe of women who want to keep men as slaves by Muriela ( Nina Hartley ) . Barb is banished , but promises to return one day . She also has to deal with Randy West as the evil king Tyrannus who kidnaps her ahem . . virgin sister , Sancha ( Jeanna Fine ) . And the only way to save her is through rampant sex . Gary Graver , who has been lacking in more recent year , had a ultra-campy classic with this one . Pretty good sex scenes in this one and even though technically it is a Barbare Dare film , Nina Hatley gets the best sex scenes it , although the last scene gives her a run for the money .
White-washing history AGAIN	Nibbles , the little orphan mouse from " The Milky Waif " returns to celebrate Thanksgiving with Jerry , and he's very VERY hungry . It's up to Tom to navigate past the sleeping Tom and get Nibbles something to quench his unsatisfiable appetite . This animated short is one of the classics , but again censorship rears it's ugly head again under the guise of trying to be PC , as one of the gags of Tom getting burnt by a candle is cut out . Whenever they censor old cartoons like that it really gets my goat . This award winning cartoon ( minus the one gag ) can be found on disc one of the Spotlight collection DVD of " Tom & Jerry " My grade for the original : My grade for the bastardized version on the DVD :
slightly confusing but just as great as the first	Time hopping and " Godfather " homages are the order of the day in this prequel to the masterpiece of Infernal Affairs 1 . Helping to flesh out the back story of Ming , Yan , Inspector Wong and future Triad boss Sam . Sam's rise to power is damn good , and Francis NG really came into his own with this film and proved he definitely has the chops as a rival Triad boss whom both sides want taken down . Also it's interesting to see how the rising of the ' bad guys ' corresponds with the downfalls and hardships of the ' good guys ' . Lines are blurred further then they were in the first film . But this film is very impenetrable if one hasn't seen the first film ( and if you haven't , shame on you go buy / rent it NOW ) , hell it's still a tad confusing even if you did . And the original's fast pace is replaced by more of a methodical slow-burn ( not to be mistaken for boring as this film is definitely not that ) . Despite the differences , this film remains the same awesome quality as the original and comes highly recommended
Can you teach an old dog new tricks ?	I have been waiting for a great Jet Li film ever since he made the jump to Hoolwood , only to be let down by a barrage pf Li teaming up with ( insert generic rap star name here ) . " Kiss of the Dragon " , another Bussen written film came closest to what I was hoping for . But with this film about a man , Danny ( Li ) whose been chained up and kept as a vicious pit bull would , Jet Li finally got to take it to a whole new level and show Western audiences what die-hard Li fans knew all along , that he has much acting talents to him as well as being amazing at martial arts . Bob Hoskins is simply amazing as Bart , the mafioso type who's owner of Danny in the beginning , The fight scenes , though sparse , are among the most brutal I'v seen in an American Jet Li film . The drama is endlessly captivating and you feel like you connect with the characters . A great film on all counts . DVD Extras : Choose between the Unrated or Extended versions ( unrated with deleted scenes spliced in ) ; An interview with Director Louis Leterrier ; 10 minute ' Serve No Master ' Featurette ; a 12 minute & 47 second Behind the Scenes featurette ; Music Videos by Massive Attack ( Atta Boy ) & The RZA ( Unleash Me ) ; and Trailers for " Cry Wolf " & " Carlito : Rise to Power "
return of the Two Mouseketeers	Jerry the Mouse , Tom the cat , and Nibbles the orphan mouse are back in the times of the three musketeers . Nibbles torture Tom unmercifully and also sings . Pretty funny stuff if you ask me . ( of course you didn't ask , but I told you anyway ) This short was nominated for an Oscar for best cartoon short subject in 1955 , but sadly didn't win . I don't know why , since this short is simply delightful . One of the first Tom and Jerry shorts to be shown in Cinemascope , This hilarious animated short can be found on disc 2 of Warner Brother's 2-DVD Spotlight Collection set .
son of a beach	Probably one of the most memorable Tom and Jerry animated shorts , has Tom the cat hopelessly smitten with his love interest at a day at the beach . Jerry the mouse , with the help of a crab ( in the crab's defense he hates Jerry as well as Tom ) , plot to of course turn Tom's good time into a day of pain , degradation and humiliation , often with hilarious results ( the clam sandwich , the sand tea , the fake wooden lady , the spit-take , and of course the umbrella spring to mind ) Viva Tom and Jerry ! ! This hilariously great cartoon can be found on disc one of the Spotlight collection DVD of " Tom & Jerry "
When trailers rocked your socks off	If you love what now would be called ' red-band ' trailers ( the greats ones that don't skimp on the good stuff , be it any of the three B's : blood , boobs , and / or bush ) , this compilation of trailers for low-budget ' grindhouse ' movies is definitely for you . True , a small handful of the trailers are useless ( thankfully relegated closely to the end , such as ' Superfuzz ' , and one or two others ) , but for the most part this collection is superb . Not one , not two , but three Christina Lindberg trailers with her in her FULL glory , if you catch my drift . ( God she's stunning ) , The Hammer when he was still at the top of his game as ' Boss Ngger ' , campy gay bike riders , and a ton of nudity , gore and violence are just a few of the delightfully high points . Of course this is not really for everyone , but anyone who wants a trip down memory lane or just wants to see how good trailers used to be , rent this ASAP . You will NOT be disappointed .
one of the greatest musicals ever made . . . seriously	Prince stars as ' the Kid ' in this semi-autobiographical film of a talented , but narcissistic young musician who has a less then stellar home life . True the acting leaves a tad to be desired ( barring Morris Day and especially Clarence Williams who are both pitch perfect ) , but the movie is still great and among the best to come out of the 1980s . It has the best soundtrack of ANY movie of the last 50 years at least , highly quotable lines , and the dumpster scene is HILARIOUS ! ! Plus Apollonia is just simply STUNNING . On an unrelated not , when I saw Prince in concert in 2004 he blew down the stadium . He is an expert showman and it was one of the best concerts that I've experienced . DVD Extras : Disc 1 ) Commentary with Director Albert Magnoli , Producer Robert Cavallo , & Director of Photography Donald Thorin ; Theatrical Trailer ; Trailers for " Under the Cherry Moon " and " Grafitti Bridge " Disc 2 ) A 12 minute featurette on the First Avenue Club ; " Purple Rain : Bachstage Pass ( a half hour featurette on the movie which i'll review later on it's page ) ; " Riffs , Raffs , and Revolution : the Impact and Influence of Purple Rain " 10 minute featurette ; 30 minutes of MTV's Premiere Footage ( when MTV didn't suck donkey balls ) ; 5 Prince music videos ( Let's Go Crazy , Take Me With You , When Doves Cry , I Would Die 4 U / Baby I'm a Star , and Purple Rain ) ; 2 Videos by The Time ( Jungle Love and The Bird ) ; and a music video for " Sex Shooter " by Apollonia 6Eye Candy : Apollonia shows her fine ass titties
a timeless classic	Two castaways ( based on Warner Brother's writers Micheal Maltese and Tedd Pierces , who also voice themselves ) find themselves on a tropical island inhabited by one Bugs Bunny . Seeing as not too long ago these two guys were eyeing each other like they were both food , they naturally start salivating when they see Bugs and proceed to chase him down in order to make some much needed stew . This is another classic from the early years of Bugs and still remains as fresh and funny as it undoubtedly was when it was first released . This one is totally timeless . This animated short can be found on Disk 1 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 3 and includes an optional commentary by John Kricfalusi and Eddie Fitzgerald .
N9t the best one in the series of Ralph / Sam but still hilarious	Sam Sheepdog , I mean Ralph , is determined not to let Wile E . Coyote . . ahem I mean Ralph Wolf get off with the sheep that he's watching . Despite the name snafu off the first Sam Sheepdog and ralph cartoon , it's still hilarious and a great short that can be watched multiple times yet still return the same amount of chuckles that it had the first time you ever saw it . The funny thing even with how funny this short is this isn't even the best of the seven Sam / Ralph cartoons . Truly a great concept . But then again I might be a tad biased as I love Wile E . Coyote . This hilarious cartoon is on Disk 3 of the " Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 1 "
