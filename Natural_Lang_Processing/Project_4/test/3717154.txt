good old Lionsgate . . .	The Hamiltons seem to be an ordinary American family , living in a small town in Northern California and dealing with the problems of everyday life . They've also been recently adjusting to the untimely death of their parents . David Hamilton , the oldest , has taken it upon his shoulders to pick up the responsibility for the orphaned family . Twins Wendell and Darlene are darker than the other two siblings and have become more conniving in the past few months . The youngest and most sensitive of the family is Francis . Francis recently found an old video camera his parents owned , and is using it to work on a school project about his family . It's through Francis ' eyes that we soon get to know the Hamiltons and realise that there are much more disturbing elements lurking below the surface of " ordinary . " . . another dire horror / thriller comes our way , and it is cheap rubbish . on the DVD cover it promises a twist in the vein of the 6th sense . where ? or am i missing the whole point . this wouldn't have even been made if Eli Roth was around . the story is non existent , the acting amateurish at best and the editing and camera-work the stuff of media studies . if this thing really floats your boat then go ahead , but believe me you will be disappointed .
worthless sequel . . .	i'm a fan of the old school eighties's movies such as Friday the 13th and nightmare on Elm st , with their low budget qualities and tense moments , so i thought i would give this a try , it even had Reggie Bannister in it from the ' Phantasm ' series . but the film is dull boring drivel , it has no redeeming qualities or any plot to speak of . a man buys a mangler from an auction , turns it into a killing machine , goes out and kidnaps a few people by banging their heads with a mallet , and feeds them to the mangler . thats the whole premise of the story , apart from the sub-plot of the burglars who cannot get any doors unlocked . the cast are wooden and therefore you have no feeling for them , and it doesn't even start to get gory until the end . avoid .
i've been reading the farmer sutra . . . .	It's been six years since the Rollins family just up and left and now the troubled Solomon family has come from Chicago , to rebuild their lives following their sons hospitalisation due to their daughter's drunk driving accident . But as they start to settle in something odd and strange begins to occur to their son . Could something supernatural be at work , and did the previous family just leave . . . or are they still here ? Trapped in the only place they've ever known ? And what did cause their deaths ? Most of all . . . is this ' killer ' still very much alive ? . . the messengers , AKA cold creek manor 2 : up the proverbial creek without a paddle . with the Pang brothers directing the movie , i was expecting something a little bit special , along the lines of the eye . what i got though was another below average horror that is so rife at the box office at the moment . when will they stop making these silly moves . the story is silly , the ' shock's are predictable and the performances are among the lines of ' how much did i get paid ? ' . it's a carbon copy of dozens of horrors to be released in Hollywood in the last five years . from references to ' the ring , ' the amityville horror ' , ' thr return ' , ' the grudge ' , ' cold creek manor ' . . . . need i really go on ? . there is nothing new to offer here , it is pure trite of the highest order . i was really looking forward to this movie , and alas i was sorely disappointed . see it by all means , i love bad movies and i love horror , but this is one of the worst horrors that i have seen this year . the Pang brothers should know better than this , but it's just another case of selling yourself out to Hollywood ( see pay check and the grudge 2 for reference , but at least they had some entertainment value ) . the messengers ? the message is . . . game over .
i wanna be a thousand pounds . . . .	Micheal carter has a perverse obsession , over feeding women . he feels it is something they should have as they are goddesses and the people who consume are the strongest people on the earth , and those who do not ( supermodel , etc ) are the weak minded on this planet . but what his victim , Deidre does not know is that Carter is placing bets on line as to when she will expire , by taking her vital observations and recording them for all to see . Phillip Jackson is an Australian cop who comes across the website and decides to investigate the case further , as he is used to dealing with the psychotic variety of the human species . but Jackson soon finds out that the fine lines between victim and killer can soon become blurred . the tag-lines were very predictable'feels like se7en ' ' on a par with silence of the lambs ' ' grossly scary ' and other clichéd summaries . the director is not the greatest in Brett Leonard ' the lawnmower man ' ' virtuosity'but i thought i would give the film a chance . the first 30 minutes was very good and interesting showing both perspective of cop and killer , mixed with some very ironic soundtrack music . this could have been very good if the film did not go off the different path and start to walk on the ' serial killer thriller with silly twist at the end ' road . once Jackson walks on to American soil , the film loses all its originality and shock value , and turns into an excuse to get the audience to feel nauseous and cause a bit of controversy . the problem is that you are so bored with the story and laughing at the terrible dialogue , that shock value is worthless and you are just waiting to see what silly twist the writers have up their sleeve . the most annoying thing about the movie is Carter , who is not a convincing villain and looks like a cut-price Jay Mohr . we are supposed to believe that he is a victim because he had a troubled life and was affected by this . but as all psychos go , he is a charming , well educated man , with a beautiful wife and house and . . . . yawn . we get on to Jackson and he is all Dirty Harry with his rough sex , breaking the rules and drinking vodka straight out of the bottle , but he is a very unconvincing hard man as he runs a mile when he is confronted by Carter and is beaten up very easily by a man who is half his size , so you start to care less about his ' mission ' . maybe this was the directors intention , for us to root for the bad guy and hope the good guy gets killed , but as i have said before , i was very un-interested by the time the film had gone past the hour mark . a waste of time , and not as shocking or as sick as you may have been led to believe . avoid like McDonalds ' burgers '
my friends call me Bud . . . .	before seeing the trailer for this movie , I , along with maybe a few others , thought this would be a sort of a continuation from Snyders re-make in 2004 . after ail , it has Rhames in this , and it's a remake of Romeros classic . how wrong i was . The only thing that this has in common with the original is the inclusion of Bud , which to be honest , is sacrilege . the infection ? oh , they begin to cough a bit and then the CGI hits them and they start to run around like drunk people trying to get to the kebab house before it closes . the story is puerile and the performances are pretty much the same . Suvari speaks and acts 2-dimensionally through the movie and as For Rhames , he barely utters a line before ' turning ' . there are some hideous stereo-types in the movie ( Salazar is the worst , what was Nick Cannon thinking ? ) and it all ends in a big CGI mess . if you are expecting anything like the original , or the re-make of Dawn Of The Dead , you are going to be sorely disappointed . oh , and it leaves the film , with a hint of a sequel . terrible
it's . . . . showtime . . . .	The fifth installment of this franchise monster , is actually a lot worse than Jason goes to hell , probably due to the fact that Jason isn't even in the film . this focuses more on tommy , the kid from part four , who snuffed Jason once and for all . we see him years later going to a ' nuthouse ' with other troubled kids , those troubles being that they like too much sex , take drugs , listen to walkmans at the breakfast table and stutter . it's as if they have tried to fuse ' one flew over the teen's cuckoo nest ' and ' psycho 2 ' . it doesn't work , even though some of the kills are inventive , you just don't seem to care for any of the characters involved . it's a mess from beginning to end , and the UK release is cut to shreds . best to avoid this and go straight to part 6
how you doin ' ? . . . .	Eddie Murphy goes for multiple characters again in this so called ' comedy ' . Murphy plays the titular character , who is a very unlucky man from the moment he is born , he is raised in an orphanage come restaurant , and meets Kate another orphan . when Kate leaves the orphanage , Norbit is left alone and soon makes friends with Rasputia . as the years go by , they eventually marry and Norbit realises that his life is doomed . but Kate returns and Norbit realises that he loves her . but Rasputias brothers are planning on buying the orphanage and turn it into a strip joint . they just need Kate to sign some papers and her fiancée ' is in on it too . can Norbit stop this catastrophe and get the girl , with hilarious results ? the latter part to the above is a big no , as this is one of the most turgid movies to be released this year . it's very racist , very sexist and very offensive . at first though , to be fair , it does raise the odd smile , but after a slew of Chinese ethnicity jokes and jokes surrounding fat people , it really does start to grate . whats even more annoying is the fact that Murphy has produced and written this mess . Murphy , the man who gave us Axel Foley , hilarious stand up with Raw and Delirious and the foul mouthed Reggie Hammond . it's such a shame that such talent has to go for gross out humour that was considered mildly amusing in 1996 when he released the nutty professor remake . the make up is extremely well done , but the characters have no imagination . Norbit reminded me of Murphys ' character in Bowfinger and Rasputia looks like a cast off of the Klump family . Newton does really well with the material given , but this is as really bad as what they say it is . it's as if Murphy and co . have thrown a lot of old jokes into a pot , and hope to get as many laughs as they could . the film goes from very bad to insane during the final act , and admittedly , you cannot help but laugh at the ridiculousness of the whole movie . this is Murphys worst film to date , and i am including Pluto Nash , Vampire in Brooklyn , Harlem Nights , Beverly Hills cop II , Daddy day care , and Another 48 hours . it's even worse than Best Defence .
i'm glad you recognised my voice . . .	Marshall Lawson loses his strike-team in a cold-blooded and seemingly random attack . After this he takes it upon himself to investigate the suspicious circumstances of the brutal killings . Soon he uncovers CTX Majestic , a covert military operation so secret , that now the military wants Marshall eliminated . Resolute in his pursuit , Marshall engages in a merciless battle with a drug dealer operation that appears to be secretly funded by a rogue arm of the military . . . . otherwise known as the harvest , this isn't as bad as what people make it out to be , but it still is one turd of a movie . basically we all know the story that this should have been called the harvest and have a totally different story , but could some one at least have made an effort on the editing ? oh and as usual , Seagal has some voice dubbing , but this time he sounds absolutely nothing like Seagal and makes the film laughable . as for the man himself , when he is on the screen he is amiable enough , but spends the first half of the film sitting in a bar and saying ASAP . he clearly looks like he is having an awful time . the story is awful as are the settings and locations . but as i have always said , i will be a lifelong fan of Seagal , no matter what crap he churns out .
i carry enough baggage for the both of us .	the film starts twenty two years ago with Professer Hudgens trying to convince Sister Clara to let him have the twenty children living at her orphanage . one of them escapes . flash forward to the present and Edward Carnby is a paranormal investigator who trying to retrieve artifacts of importance before they fall into the wrong hands and open a door that has been closed for ten thousand years . . . . . from the start i knew that i was in for a bumpy ride following the painful narration and text on the screen explaining the whole story for those who wouldn't be able to follow the story . so that would be every one then . having never seen a film by the elusive Uwe Boll , i decided to give him a chance . wow , do believe the hype of how bad a director this person is . the man has no idea how to direct a movie , doesn't know how to manage his time and doesn't even know how to homage a film . the editing is clumsy and at times the film cuts to another scene just as it looks like someone was going to say something . narrative is poor ( probably the worst i have seen ) and the three leads , while not appalling , seem to be just working for the money and their expressions look like ' what shall i spend my cash on ? ' but the biggest gripes are . . . 1 . Matthew Walker who plays Professor Hudgens . for such a pivotal character in the film , they chose probably the worst actor ever to grace the big screen . maybe Ben Kingsly was busy . 2 . the story . it was missing . the film made no sense whatsoever . 3 . special effects . bullet time and slow motion while jumping does not make a cool movie . 4 . ripping off of other movies . Slater looks like he is trying to be like Deckard from Blade Runner and the film rips off movies such as aliens , resident evil , 28 days later and even ghostbusters . 5 . at times the lighting is so bad that it is hard to understand what is going on . 6 . plot holes . sure i've mentioned before that there is no story , but the film does leave some questions unanswered . 7 . a silly love scene to some silly music by neneh cherry . not deserved of it's high place in the bottom hundred , but deserved of a place there , it is a bad film but not bad enough to want to turn it off .
i don't get too many second dates . . . . . .	somewhere in this movie , there is a story , but it is not very strong and very confusing . . . Sonni Griffith is a secret government agent , who is assigned to protect a woman who's husband has been killed . over on the other side of the story , there is an owner of a soccer team who wants his team to win a match to enable him to take a bomb to America and of course ' detonate ' it . somewhere along the line the stories join up and make sense toward the end . since Snipes has decided to go to DTV , he has made some very mediocre movies , and this is just another one . he is on auto pilot for the majority of the film and rarely shows any emotion . the support is not much better as they spend most of the time trying to work out what the hell is going on and why they are doing what they are doing . the action is fine , Snipes does have a few fights but there are some terrible moments in the film . Snipes supposed voice over sounds nothing like him , there are some terrible green-screen used and the sound track comes right out of a horror movie . the ' twist ' at the end comes a mile off and really snipes can do no worse in the future . when watching this , you realise just how long ago it was when he played ' Nino Brown ' . still he has a nice selection of shirts and his impression of the gay man from ' manniquen ' at the beginning is a joy . one for die-hard Snipes fans only .
was that the boogeyman ? . . .	Fifteen years ago a small six year old boy called Michael Myers brutally slashed his elder sister to death . Locked up till his 21st birthday , he escapes the mental institution that held him for fifteen years and makes his way back to his hometown intent on a murderous rampage pursued by Dr Sam Loomis who is Michael's doctor and the only one who knows Michael's true evil . Elsewhere a shy teenager by the name of Laurie Strode is babysitting on the night Michael comes home . . . is it pure coincidence that she and her friends are being stalked by him ? this remake / re-imagining / whatever you want to call it , suffers from the same crisis that Hannibal Rising suffered from earlier in the year , giving a favourite movie villain a back story . yes we all know that the original had ' that ' opening scene , but Myers came from a good family in the original , not like the Manson / Texas chainsaw family depicted here . Zombie is trying to make the audience feel empathy for Myers , but it's such sacrilege to the Original , which in that , Myers is just credited as ' the shape ' , now how can someone feel empathy for a shape . as usual with a movie directed by Zombie , it's way over the top with profanity and is very , very loud , but it's the girls that myers stalk that have foul language , and were basically foul , so you were not very shocked when he killed who he did ( stereotypical horror movie deaths ) on the plus side McDowell does deliver a good performance as loomis and for the horror Buffs their are some quirky cameos from Kier , Foree , and Dourif . and the original soundtrack is used to good effect . it's such a shame that Zombie has made a bad film as the trailers made it look so promising , and it could have made up for years of bad Haloween sequels ( H2O not counted ) . but he broke the big role of Myers justification of his early films , coming from a loveless family , which makes one of the most famous horror icons , just not very scary . more of a trick than a treat .
i just like to kill monkeys . . . . .	after the mysterious death of the scientist Dr . Devin Villiers , Detective Frank Turner and his partner Det . Lisa Martinez are assigned to protect Devin's colleague Dr . Maggie Dalton . Lisa is killed while protecting Maggie , and Frank presses her to tell what is happening . She discloses that a veteran soldier called Michael Griffin was submitted to an experiment with the object to create the ultimate national security weapon , an undetectable soldier . However , the experiment failed , with horrible side effects due to the damage to the cells caused by the radiation . Michael is chasing Maggie to get the necessary buffer to survive . . . with the success of the original movie , it was predictable that somewhere down the line there would be a sequel . this has nothing to do with it's predecessor , other than a few hints of this sort of test being done before . there is no real story to the film , other than ' invisible man wants treatment ' and contains some ludicrous scenes and unnecessary nudity . the cast all look bored and not into the material , and the only reason why anyone would really honestly want to see this film is to see if the effects are as good ad the predecessor . unfortunately they are not , as the budget was obviously a lot smaller this time around . Slater does his best with the material given to him , but in all honestly , he could have done his part in one day , with most of his part being voice over work . those who are interested only for the effects , should just watch the last fifteen minutes where they have an invisible man fight . a waste of time , along with other straight to DVD sequels such single white female 2 , and 8mm 2 , just a blatant cash in .
welcome to the thunderdome . . . .	a day in the life of the employees of the restaurant known as ' shenaniganz ' , hilarity most certainly does not ensue when we see them work , talk , and get up to all sorts of ' shenanigans ' . . . it did have a lot of promise . the story was there , the cast were very well cast , it's just that the execution of the whole film was poorly done , and the outcome is boring , on the verge of dire . Reynolds does his best with the material he is given , using his all too familiar Chevy Chase routine , but this time with a paedophile edge , it soon grates . Long is basically reprising his role from dodgeball , and soon becomes lost in the mix . Faris is amiable enough , but maybe that is because she is hardly in the movie . the rest of the cast are just pure filler , with the second rate Jay and Silent Bob in the form of some wannabe teenage gangsters and the rest of the characters are filled with oddball un-funny stereotypes . the only person to come unscathed from this debacle is Luis Guzman , who is quite funny , but given very little screen time . the editing is poor , narration shoddy at best , and the whole film finishes with a whimper . the only part in this movie that deserves any recognition is toward the end , where the editing is turned into a Donnie Darko type sequence , situated around the restaurant . but this scene , cannot justify a rental . avoid .
batter up . . . .	Detective Jacob Stillwell is one of the most celebrated homicide detectives in the country . His brutal delivery of street justice is legendary among the men and women of law enforcement . But on this latest case , he may have finally met his match with Lazerus , a cunning and perversely violent killer who is on the loose and terrorising the inner city . Stillwell's desperate pursuit of Lazerus takes him into the dark , depraved Memphis underworld of street sex and senseless violence . . . . what is it with Seagal and making bad movies ? for every half decent movie he makes ( pistol whipped ) , he churns out cheap stuff like this . yes he has a writing credit , but then he was in the glimmer man too , which this is a complete rip off of . what was Seagal thinking when he was writing this ? this man won't just be kicked out of a window , i'll kick him out of the window , and i will show it from at least ten ( yes ten ) different cuts , and i will also use the same trick when i am walking through a door . now this can be forgiven , because it puts the movie into , so bad it's god territory , but then you have the stunt doubles , the only time where Seagal doesn't use a stunt double from behind , is when the blonde is getting naked at the end , and probably the worse editing i have ever seen in my life . plus points the fights are pretty brutal if poorly edited , thats it . and i have no idea what he ending has to do with anything , it looks like they borrowed it from another movie . a bit of a letdown .
welcome home son	drew latham has it all . a man with a great job but a different way of showing his Christmas spirit . he gives his girlfriend a ticket to Fiji for the holidays , but she wants to spend it with family . left on his own and with none of his friends willing to accommodate him , he finds solace by returning to his childhood home to try and get some spirit . he offers the new owners a considerable amount of money to stay with them over the holidays and they agree . this film starts off in a really good way . the opening credits show people at different levels of despair , and you fell that this maybe a different kind of Christmas comedy . but it soon falls into the trap of becoming another schmaltzy , sugar coated feel good comedy that this season brings every year . with a cast of this calibre you would expect something a little more better . Affleck is quite unlikable in his role and deserves to be on his own . gandolfini , o hara and applegate are wasted in their roles and given little to do . cuts and rewrites in the script are sorely evident and the ending just happens too quickly for my liking . giving a different cast and a better script this could have been a nice twisted comedy . instead it is a rehash of old jokes and pratfalls ruined by a very slimy affleck . but i imagine it would be quite good to watch on Christmas eve . then again , a wonderful life it ain't .
first , i have fun . . . . . .	superman decides to rid the earth of all it's nuclear weapons , as he feels that this will make the earth a safer place . meanwhile Lex Luthor escapes from prison ( again ) , and plots to destroy superman ( again ) . he decides to clone superman from a strand of his hair in a museum ( a strand the can hold a ton , would love to have seen the scissors ! ! ) , and by this he creates nuclear man a new kid on the block who is powered by the sun . let the battle commence . this could have been a great film if the budget had not have been cut and a lot of the film on the cutting room floor , would have been left in the actual picture . the problem is the message that the film is trying to get across . reeve ( rip ) had great intention when writing the story , but it just doesn't do the character justice . the effects are very poor and the fight scenes between superman and nuclearman are very very boring indeed . ( if you want to see superman in action , check out the second movie ) . gone also is the humour from II and III , and silly subplots spoil the film . narrative is non existent and plot holes are huge . you know when the titles roll and the music isn't quite right , you are in trouble . a perfect example of how a studio can ruin a movie . but supermans final line is very ironic ' see you in twenty '
hey pa ' you wearing my teeth ?	Butch " Bullet " Stein is a Jewish junkie from the mean streets of Brooklyn , is paroled after eight years in prison . Butch rips off a runner for local drug dealer , Tank , and is soon right back into his old habits of snorting coke and shooting up heroin with his best friend Lester . Enraged by Butch's affront and already determined to get revenge on him for a past wrong , Tank sets about getting even with his old enemy by hiring a hulking brute , Gates to beat Butch . When the confrontation occurs , however , Gates breaks his hand on the battle-hardened Butch . Besides Lester , the only people in Butch's corner are his two brothers , the mentally - unhinged Vietnam War veteran Louis and aspiring artist Ruby , neither of whom can be counted on to help him in the inevitable showdown . . . Julien Temple is fantastic at directing music videos , but when he comes to make movies , he sort of loses the plot ( see absolute beginners ) . i don't know where to start with this movie , but within the first ten minutes of the opening , we are treated to Rourke stripping two young boys , him stabbing someone in the eye , and Ted Levind doing his best buffalo bill impression this side of Silence of the lambs . to say the film was random would be an understatement , it's so confusing that it cannot help but to be enjoyed . Tupac turns up with an obvious grudge about something , swears a lot disappears for a while and come back later and do the same . basically the film has no plot , the narrative is poor to say the least , and when you see a man sitting in a pink Cadillac listening to ' i'm too sexy ' by right said Fred ' you know you are in trouble . but it's worth watching just for the randomness of the film
they fly ! they frickin fly !	the prologue to the movie shows three men 30 years ago find a church at the top of a mountain , with a cave hidden in the church . fast-forward 30 years and there are scientists who need the help of ' cave technicians ' to guide them through the cave they have discovered . once they have got deep into the cave , they realise that they are not alone . . . . and that's the premise of the film apart from a not very clever twist at the end , this movie is a carbon copy of ' the descent ' with a little bit of ' pitch black ' , ' aliens v predator ' and ' dawn of the dead thrown in ' . the acting is terrible and for a film like this , where the primary characters are in peril , you care very little for their outcome . the story and the script are clichéd and ruin the film even more . the only things that are stopping this movie from scoring any lower are the lighting , which for such a bad film was very , very impressive , and one stand out scene involving climbing , a blow torch , and the worst Dr evil impression this side of Kevin Spacey . approach with caution
this plays like an extended episode of the x files	this plays like an extended episode of the x files . no one really has much to do in the film other than to look concerned every fifteen minutes or so . Unfortunately the hype surrounding the movie was better than the movie itself , with the genius trailer playing actual evp voices and then giving you a link to an actual evp website , which admittingly left me tantalised for the movieThere is no problems with the acting , Micheal Keaton is rather convincing as the mourning widow , but half way through the movie he just becomes all psycho and sit in front of numerous televisions and record nothing on to blank video cassettes . Which is what i wish i was watching in the last third of the movie . its a shame that most people are like me and will see this movie regardless of what warning anyone gives them ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
bowels in or out ? . . .	After having successfully eluded the authorities for years , Hannibal peacefully lives in Italy in disguise as an art scholar . Trouble strikes again when he is discovered leaving a deserving few dead in the process . He returns back to America to once again make contact with now disgraced Agent Clarice Starling who is suffering the wrath of a malicious FBI official / rival as well as the media . Meanwhile , Hannibal must survive the advances by a disfigured and vengeful victim he first came in contact with years ago as a patient . He finds himself being tracked down not only by his wealthy victim and his henchmen but also by Agent Starling and the American authorities . . . . . Hopkins returns for his second outing as the titular bad guy , and this time he's bought more charm and more of a sense of humour to the lovable old serial killer . and thats where the problem lies , he's lovable . too lovable to be scary , to lovable to be hated . the most iconic ' villain ' of the nineties has gone soft in this film . he's not the monster , it's the story and the laughable over the top performances from Liotta and Oldman . it's not a bad film by any means , it just feels too rushed and sometimes it tries to be too clever for it's own good , with all the subtle hints to death and the subliminal images of Hopkins during the credits . but overall , this was always going to disappoint next to ' silence of the lambs ' , It's just a shame that such an iconic villain was reduced to wearing a cape and skulking around Florence spouting out one liners to the upper classes .
have you seen my daughter ? . . . . .	a bereaved woman and her child are flying from Brelin to New York to bury their husband / father . when the mother awakes from a three hour sleep , she cannot locate her daughter . she begins to search the plane , panic becoming more and more evident in her face . she alerts the stewards , who inform the captain , and they begin a search of all sections of the plane . but the flightplan states that the woman was travelling on her own and nobody on the flight can remember seeing the little girl . is this just a figment of the woman's imagination , or are there more sinister things afoot ? from the beginning this movie has Hitchcock / The lady vanishes written all over it and in some parts it does work very well , but there are some gaping plot holes . 1 . just who are the two men staring at Foster in the beginning scenes . 2 . how did ' they ' get her daughter , drug her , and hide her without being noticed ? 3 . and how did no one on the flight not see her daughter . at all ? the problem with this film is the incidental music . whenever their are villains in the scene ( before the ' twist ' ) the incidental music starts to shriek . Foster is good in her limited role and does use the material to her credit , but in the advent of all films with a twist ending , this has to be one of the weakest going . Kudos to Sean Bean too who does very well in the film and give it an extra point . if the plot holes were not so big and the writers did keep with their original choice ( Sean Penn ) then this would have been a major thriller . but it only manages to be another grieving mother in peril movie with stupid references ( almost racist ) to the tragic September 11th events . watch it for curiosity , but please do not do what i did , and read a summary of the movie before seeing it . disappointing
i am Chucky , the killer doll . and i dig it ! ! !	Chucky and Tiffany are being used as puppets on a film based on their real lives . when their child sees them on TV , it travels to Hollywood and resurrects them both . again Chucky and Tiffany need to find two human bodies for sacrifice before their souls become trapped in their doll bodies for good . but the twist this time is that Tiffany wants actress Jennifer Tilly to be her sacrifice . Tillys career isn't going very well in this story and she will do anything to get a role . its a shame that Chucky and Tiffany are ruining her hopes to become big again . a continuation of the dwindling franchise , this is out of place a the fifth child ' play movie , but on it ' own , it i a great parody of horror movie and camp cult classics . Tilly is fantastically self-deprecating in her role and does not mind having a lot of fun being taken out of her , which means she is a very good sport . the film references several films such asHalloween , in the opening scene it is all from glen / Glenda's point of view . other movies referenced without giving too much away are psycho , the shining , glen or Glenda , vertigo , and the omen . there is also one laugh out loud scene involving Chucky and a former pop princess . the line Chucky delivers is fantastic ! ! ! some major flaws though involve the story , as it is really convoluted and very confusing , and if you are new to the franchise , will make no sense whatsoever . so if you want a good laugh with plenty of gore , then this is for you . horror aficionados will sneer at the movie , because it is not scary or does it have a lot of tension . a wasted opportunity .
you kids are soft ! you lack discipline !	trying to create box office from the success of twins Arnie has made a fun comedy , but it's just a little too dark and profane for the kids . the first twenty minutes wouldn't look out of place from any other Arnie movie as wit is very dark and violent , but i suppose this does help with the movies narrative to show the audience what a tough cop Kimble is . the thing is though that we already know that Kimble is a tough cop because he is played by Schwarzenegger , and having him as a nursery teacher is the main selling point for this movie . as soon as Kimble enters the school to start his undercover job , the film switches to the sugar coated effect and cliché starts to kick in . from Kimble shouting at the kids initially , to him becoming fond of the kids and even sticking up for them . there is no way that this film could be made now , as it is so un p . c . and would offend many teacher now . Arnie is good in his role and always works good with Ivan Reitman . he has great chemistry with the kids and is a great father figure to them all . bu the standout of the show is Richard Tyson , who plays Crisp the bad guy . he is one bad guy you do want Arnie to kick through a wall , but the children do add to this emotion . not a bad film , but if it didn't have the dark tone to the film and was less profane , it would be good family fun .

They soon learn that a woman living in the building has been infected by something unknown . After a few of the residents are viciously attacked , they try to escape with the news crew in tow , only to find that the CDC has quarantined the building . Phones , internet , televisions and cell phone access have been cut-off , and officials are not relaying information to those locked inside . When the quarantine is finally lifted , the only evidence of what took place is the news crew's videotape . . . a hybrid of the Blair Witch Project , 28 Days Later and in some respects Right at your door , this remake of Rec , isn't as bad as what the critics and users on here make to be . it would be an even better film if it was an original idea , but just lately , films with handhel camera-work and ' lost footage ' are two a penny , so this is where the film falters . the performances are good , but become a little too much toward the end , with all the screaming and hyperventilating becoming more of an annoyance than upping the tension . at just under 90 minutes , it moves swiftly along , but there isn't really a character in the film to really sympathise with and it all too often relies on the jump scares in dark places . still worth the time to watch though .
played by a loser . . . . . .	A DEA agent provides former Marine Tim Kearney with a way out of his prison sentence : impersonate Bobby Z , a recently deceased drug dealer , in a hostage switch with a crime lord . When the negotiations go awry , Kearney flees , with Z's son in tow . a thriller that doesn't take itself at all seriously , the film is fast , breezy and sometimes fun . Walker plays the same role as he always doe , the good looking guy who can get himself into a bit of trouble and get out of it with his pearly whites and silly wrestling moves when he's having a scrap , and he has long hair in the first act , so he must be hard . Fishbourne plays it purely for laughs , and it works in his favour , double crossing people left right and centre , which at times can be confusing as Z has so many different people after him . it's no masterpiece , it tested poorly with audiences , hence the straight to DVD release , but it's different and a bit left-field , and not as bad as some straight to DVD releases out there . worth watching if you want to see something different and kooky
that's a lot of toilet paper ! ! !	Scott Roper is the best hostage negotiator in San Francisco . His girlfriend is a newspaper reporter . While listening to a baseball game on his car stereo , Scott is called downtown where a man named Earl is holding 17 hostages in a bank . Scott rescues the hostages by shooting Earl . Scott is then assigned a partner - - sharpshooter Kevin McCall . That night , Scott takes his friend , Lieutenant Sam Baffert , to see a man named Michael Korda . Scott waits downstairs while Sam is in Korda's apartment . Sam asks Korda about a man who deals in stolen jewelry , because Sam suspects that some of the dealer's jewels came from Korda , who is a professional jewel thief . Sam's visit with Korda ends with Korda killing Sam . Scott runs inside the building and sees the body . Scott wants revenge on Korda , but Captain Frank Solis refuses to let Scott work the case , so Scott decides to work the case on his own . , then they are called to a downtown jewelry store where hostages are being held . When Scott notices that Korda is the hostage taker , Korda grabs a hostage and leaves in a truck . Scott and Kevin use Captain Solis's car to chase Korda . Scott shows up and chases Teal down the fire escape , and Teal is hit and killed by a car . On the next morning , Korda escapes from the jail , and soon after escaping , Korda kidnaps Ronnie , luring Scott into a confrontation at an abandoned shipyard . probably Murphys least accessible movie , as the viewer doesn ; t know whether they are watching comedy , or a serious thriller . throughout , we see the laughs that Murphy provided us in his earlier films , and then later in reminded us of what drivel the man can make . there are some really good set pieces in this film but , they are few and far between , it ; s not very funny in the slightest , but Wincott keeps the tension high for a while . one of those films yo could watch once , say it's good , and then see for a second time and say the opposite . average .
i know cop in every language . . .	A team of professional thieves are hired to rob a jewelry exchange . Now a Chinese guy throws a monkey wrench into their plans . When it's over all that they got is a bag full of black gems which is what the man who hired them wanted . Now the leader brings it to his fence . the Chinese man shows up wanting the gems . He also tells him that they are not gems . When they go to the fence to get them , they discover that someone stole them . His daughter has been kidnapped by the man who owns the stones , and wants them back . They discover that the one sho stole them is a rival of the criminal , while they go to every single one of his associates to find who has them . The man who kidnapped his daughter is also doing what he can to find them . . after the success of ' Exit Wounds ' , it was inevitable that Joel Silver thought that rap star DMX had a future in the action genre , as long as he starred with a big name , and have Anderson and Arnold there for laughs . the outcome is pretty decent enough action , but we have come to expect this from Silver having produced some of the most prolific action films in past memory . the problem is , the acting isn't up to much , and trying to start an acting career from somebody who cannot act but do moody great , is not a wise move . but Li is as always laid back and the fight scenes are are good but not great . the plot is predictable as is the outcome , but the editing and producing , are very slick , so just stick to the action scenes , and forget about plot . the makers did . .
Caleb ? ?	Cage stars as as lecturer whose son gets part of a time capsule that was buried fifty years prior . while the other kids get pictures of spaceship and other futuristic guff , Caleb gets a sheet of paper with numbers scribbled over it . what is revealed next is that the numbers have predicted disastrous events that have happened in recent years , and there are still more numbers yet to be used , leading up to what could be the apocalypse . if you could take away the last twenty minutes of this movie , and drop the whole metaphorical garden of eden thing at the end , this could have been a really good movie . but as soon as Cage encounters one of the ' angels ' and it makes the invasion of the bodysnatchers noise , it unfortunately turns absurd , really really absurd . Proyas makes some stunning movies , Dark City , The Crow and to some extent I , Robot , were impressive movies in their own genre , but this takes a step back for him , whilst watching this , on several occasions i was waiting for Keanu Reeves to pop up from ' the day the earth stood still ' . Cage does his best with the material given to him , and does well , considering some of the acting choices he has made in the last few years . there are some amazing scenes in the film though , the Plane crash is very eerie and disturbing , and the subway scene really has to be seen to be believed . so really , it's not a bad little film , it can be intense , and quite uneasy viewing , but the ending obliterates the first two acts . after seeing this you will probably ' know ' what i mean . . .
van damme does dark . . . . . . . . . . . . .	OK this film is supposed to be about illegal organ transplants but really it's a showcase for van damme to show off his new gruff voice and face his most un-nerving villain in the sandman . van damme has never looked better and he must have thought his wishes came true at once starring alongside the once hot Cynthia Gibb . it does though borrow a lot from the previous years lock up , but what we get at the end is a marvellous battle between van damme and the sand man . i wonder whether James Cameron got inspiration for the t2 finale by watching the finale for this , there some comparisons . as usual , in the world of van damme there are some weird and wonderful characters , and it is great to see Al leung in a van damme movie . not his best film at all , but there are far more worse out there ! !
i'm a soldier of the apocalypse man . . . . . .	In South Central Los Angeles , the unbalanced , deranged and neurotic ex-Ranger Jim Luther Davis meets his best friend Miguel ' Mike ' Alonzo to drink beers and smoke joint . Jim is expecting to join the LAPD to marry his Mexican girlfriend Marta while Mike is being pressured by his mate Sylvia to find a job . When Jim is refused by the police department , he becomes furious and begins a series of violent actions until he is called by the Federal agency and assigned to work in Colombia . Meanwhile , Mike gets a dream job , making Sylvia happy . Jim invites the weak Mike and their friend Toussant to spend the weekend in Mexico . then Jim really begins to lose it . . . . directed by Ayer , the chap who gave us the excellent training day , basically rehashes that story and gives it a little twist , as the two protagonists are both unlikeable , and on hindsight , really deserve what happens to them . Once again Bale towers over everyone in his role , and it probably his best role since American Psycho . he is the one who gives the film it's underlying tension throughout , a guy so delusional and angry , that someone looking at him the wrong way causes him rage . imagine D-Fens from falling down with a war type syndrome , and your nearly there . the story is OK , but not the greatest thing in the world , and i doubt this would have been made were it not for training day . but the rest of the cast are good in their respective roles , although Longoria does seen a little wasted with the material given to her . the locations are really something , and so is the camera-work , never once in the film , is there a calm moment , even when the leads are talking or just ' chilling ' , the viewer never really feels at ease , as you never know how Jim will react . Bale is that good . a good film , but heavily relying on training day .
you're gonna have to look between your legs to tell the time . . .	Bronsons last collaboration with the Cannon group is probably one of his best films of the eighties , and it is a very sleazy film with very in-pc characters which owes a little bit of a debt to Eastwoods 1984 thriller tightrope . Bronson stars as another carbon copy of his character Paul Kersey , a cop who bends the law a little to get his man . and the ' man ' in this particular film is duke a pimp who kidnaps minors and rents them to wealthy businessmen . irking Bronson as he has a daughter around the same age , he spends the majority of the movie bullying duke and talking really angrily toward his superiors . he sets fire to Dukes car and even makes him swallow his own watch , and defending his 67 year old body against a tyraid of bad guys . in the mix somewhere there are subplots involving Bronson's daughter getting touched up on the bus by a Japanese business man , and the same business man having his daughter kidnapped by duke , but these sub-plots are side lined by the silly set pieces and one of the most funniest scripts ever written . the film hasn't aged well and is very racist in some respects due to way Bronson treats the minorities ( his rant outside of a hotel is pretty shocking and would have him shot today ) , but this is Bronson after all , and as one of his daughters friends state ' boy , he IS extreme'if you are a fan of the cannon films of the eighties or a Bronson fan , this is a great movie to watch , a great cheesy soundtrack and full of disposable bad guys , and a great ending that is a little bit different for once .
don't be scared mommy . . . . .	Jack Bauer is taking a well deserved break from CTU , so he gets a job as a night guard in a burnt out department store . before you can say ' hostile down ' he starts to see ghostly images in mirrors day in and day out . not forgetting his CTU roots , Bauer starts to investigate a name that the mirrors show him , Esseker , and finds some sinister facts about the run down store , and what it used to harbor . before long , he and his family are threatened by the mirror images he sees in everyday life . the only problem with this film is that the ghost of Bauer is constantly haunting Sutherland throughout the duration of the film . his mannerisms , his threats and half of the dialogue spoken by Ben screams Bauer , and that actually throws the tension of the film out of the window , because you find you are always waiting for his cell phone to ring and to hear the famous ' 24 ' clock ticking at every interval . still , the story is quite solid , and the effects are quite chilling at times , and the sets are creepy too . the ending leaves a lot to be desired though , and it could have done without the ' planet of the apes ' style ending . plus coming from a director who made ' Haute tension ' and the reasonable remake of ' the hills have eyes ' you could have expected something a little more special , rather than redundant . it's a good Friday night movie , but will leave you wanting season 7 to start immediately . .
either quit smoking or get a new lighter . . .	It was an ingenious enough plan : rob the Riviera Casino's count room during an Elvis impersonator convention . But Thomas Murphy decides to keep all the money for himself and shoot all his partners , including recently-freed ex-con Michael Zane . With $3 . 2 million at stake , the Marshals Service closing in , and single mom Cybil Waingrow and her son Jesse constantly confounding things , Michael must track down Murphy . . . it's a great idea , and a great B-list cast , with some good set pieces and a great turn from Costner , so how the hell did this fail ? it's just a little too leftfield and quirky for some tastes , and this was released at a point when Costner movies spelt box office doom , but thats been happening since 1994 , with the exception of The Guardian . there is nothing pretentious about it , it's just an out and out ballsy action movie , with a nasty streak going through it . all the cast are good , and even though the ending is a little ridiculous , it fits in well with the movie . if you want an action movie , that is a little different , you could do a lot worse than this
it would be embarrassing to be killed by an amateur . . . .	if a movie can kill two acting careers in one go , it demands to be seen and here it is . basically this is based on the same source material that was used for the Stallone vehicle Cobra , ten years prior to this . Crawford plays a lawyer , who the KGB want dead , because of something to do with a boat . when an attempt on her life goes awry ( a cat does die though ) William Baldwin , some dodgy camera effects , and good pyrotechnics come to her rescue . for the following hour we have very much of the same , including Steven Berkoffs amazing rendition of a Russian ( as seen in Rambo II , and Octopussy ) , and Cindy Crawfords attempt at being an actress , which is probably worse to sit through than root canal surgery , seriously , she makes Paris Hilton look like Streep in ' house of wax ' , and is the main problem with this movie . from the upstart of the movie it looks pretty much on par with an episode of Baywatch , all silly soundtrack , slow motion running on the beach , and then the Silver Pictures Production part of the movie kicks in . one thing about the movie is the pyrotechnics , they are impressive and easily the best thing about the movie . Baldwin does not convince as an action lead , and is very painful to watch , especially some of his facial expressions through the movie . i have never seen someone mix ' panic ' and ' constipation ' so well in a movie . but at the end of the day it's just an action movie , with some good , if poorly edited set pieces , and it's over very quickly .
running would be a good idea . . .	an enormous creature is created in the jungles of the south pacific by nuclear fallout , on the way to his trip to Manhattan , he destroys a boat , which just happens to have Al leong on it , the guy who gets killed in all his films , including lethal weapon and die hard . once he reaches the shores of Manhattan , Godzilla wreaks havoc by walking down the streets and and destroying buildings by wafting his big tail and walking through them . he also destroys a lot of vehicles too by stamping on them . but he misses Hank Azaria , which is a good thing because he is one of the decent things about this film . the army also destroy a lot of Manhattan landmarks by not being very good at shooting at a 65 foot creature , so it is up to Matthew Broderick , Maria Pitillo and Jean Reno ( part of the french secret service ) to help save the day . but Godzilla isn't the only thing that these people have to worry about . and where does Brodericks hat go in the second and final act ? ? this film is very , very bad . but thankfully this beast of a movie falls into the ' so bad it's good ' category . the leads are very wooden in this and Broderick spends most of the time looking bemused and wondering whether this will do better than ' the cable guy ' . but thankfully there is some great support from Dunn , Lerner and some of the cast of the simpsons . the creature isn't very impressive , but the destruction that it makes is phenomenal and there are some great use of special effects in some of the set pieces . Manhattan does look very cool in this movie and although Emmerich does destroy most of it ( like in all his other movies ) does make the city a character in itself . with some great movie references and some genuinely funny moments involving alienation and jean Reno , this is no where near as bad as the reception it received when first released and is a lot of fun to watch . it's a shame it doesn't have the heart a the original ' gojira ' movies . but a fun movie all the same .
is this a church meeting , or is this a bar ? . . . .	When young Violet finally follows her dream and moves to New York to become a songwriter , she knows little about the big city . All her efforts to get a demo tape to a producer are useless , additionally her apartment is broken in to , leaving her with nothing . But a coincidence leads her to Coyote Ugly , a night club where only beautiful women call the shots , using their female attraction to drive the guests just crazy . Violet manages to get a position and starts learning the ways of the city . After getting in trouble because of a misunderstanding , Violet's new friend Kevin tries to rid her of her stage fear so that she can perform her songs herself . Violet's father Bill does not like her new job as well as her leaving him , but it's all part of growing up . . . . it's took me 8 years to pluck up the courage to watch this movie . it had absolutely no appeal to me ( obviously apart from the bar sequences ) and even though Bruckheimer is one of my favourite producers , i still had my doubts . how surprised i was to find that not only could be classed as a ' chick flick ' but it also has some big potential to be a lad's film too . it's a breezy enough simple film ( girl trying to chase her dream and all that tosh ) with a very attractive cast , and just like any feel good film it has it's ups and downs for the main character , as she finds it a bit of a challenge in the big wide world . it's a slickly produced piece of nonsense with a great soundtrack , with some decent performances , and a predictable but happy ending . it's a perfect date movie , dancing girls for the men and a good story for the girls . a guilty pleasure . .
now thats how you dig a hole . . . . .	similarities to films such as ' man bites dog ' and ' the last horror movie ' will strike a cord while watching this , but it's just the style of filming that are similar , the story isn't though . Man bites dog was about a thrill killer who wasn't paid to kill his victims , and the last horror movie was about an experiment , in which the protagonist wanted to reach his audience . this mockumentary is about the life of Ray , a hit-man who allows a student to film him for a project . during the film we meet one of his potential hits , who gets rays attention when he offers him money to spare his life . from watching this , this is the first time that Ray has been unprofessional with his job . the film never really leads to much and never really shocks in the way that it intends , but there is something about this film that screams ' watch me ' . the actors in the film are amateurs , and while the acting is bad in some places , the camera-work and lighting is gritty and adds intensity to some scenes during the movie . another good experiment in the medium , but ends up all rather pointless in the end , but worth watching .
say what you want to say . . . .	Will Smith makes essentially ' Pay it Forward ' for grown ups , but without the tooth pullingly awful ending . his character is quite mysterious , never giving a secret away , being nice to some and being horrible to others , but all for the same cause , redemption . this is my perception of the movie , Smiths character obviously wants to redeem himself for something , but the flashbacks and the connotations can sometimes be confusing and make the film a little difficult to understand . but it all makes sense in the end , and you get to realise the reason for the title . Smith is good in his role and really sells himself to the ' Academy ' , but harrelson is by far the best thing in this movie . even though he isn't in it for long , his character gives more of an impact than any other . all the characters are likable though , and from what i have read about the movie , people have very different opinions on the movie . it's not for everyone thats for sure , but it's really one of those films you have to be in the mood to watch .
Atomised . . . .	After a chaotic childhood with a hippie mother only caring for her affairs , Michael , a molecular biologist , is more interested in genes than women , while Bruno is obsessed with his sexual desires , but mostly finds his satisfaction with prostitutes . His pitiful life changes when he gets to know the experienced Christiane . In the meantime , Michael meets Annabelle , the love of his youth , again . . . this movie isn't for everyone , maybe even fans of the original book will not like this because almost all of the scientific elements are left out of the movie , and it focuses more on Bruno , who arguably is the more interesting of the two brothers . though i'm sure that other people find the other Brother more interesting if they watch the film in a different perspective . the film is very well made and uses colours to good effect , especially when we flashback to the hippy era , we are treated to a psychedelic type colour trip during that sequence . the performances are good and it's always nice to see Potente on screen . but i feel that a lot of the film will go over a lot of peoples heads if they haven't read the original novel . funny and tragic in equal measures , with an awesome soundtrack to boot , this is a fantastic movie about sexual awakening and perversion .
i found the typewriter . . . . .	San Francisco heiress Page Forrester is brutally murdered in her remote beach house . Her husband Jack is devastated by the crime but soon finds himself accused of her murder . He hires lawyer Teddy Barnes to defend him , despite the fact she hasn't handled a criminal case for many years . There's a certain chemistry between them and Teddy soon finds herself defending the man she loves . . . . back in 1985 , when this was first released , this would have been one hell of a movie . 23 years later , it still has some good value , but being from the heart of the eighties , it has aged badly , from the clothes , to the hair , and to the unintentional laugh out loud incidental music that is playing when we see the killers point of view . the story is good , professional person turning her job into a personal one , and the performances are great , but it all seems old hat now . but saying that , even though i knew the outcome before i'd seen this , i was still a bi5t surprised . a worthy court-room thriller , but nothing spectacular .
cue the cheesy inspirational music . . . .	Bruce Nolan is a newsreporter who is waiting to be upgraded to be a news anchor . he is fed up with his mediocre job and finally cracks when he finds out he hasn't got he job . after getting fired , beat up by thugs , fights with Grace ( his girlfriend ) , and crashes his car , he decides to denounce god for all that he stands for . soon after he receives a page from an unknown number and is offered a job if he goes to the building described . there , he meets God who gives Bruce his powers to do with them what he wishes . . . . Jim Carrey hit the big time again after this movie . the one that was most successful for him before this was Liar Liar . here he is yet again with the same sort of schtick , gurning to the camera and overpowering anyone who dares to share the camera with him . he never gives up at a lot of the film is improvised and this is where Carrey shines . the man is a real comic genius . sure the man can grate at times , but when he is firing on all cylinders and given a high concept idea like this , there is no stopping the man . with a great cast including Jennifer Aniston and Morgan Freeman , ironically as god , Carrey has great support from the cast and they are not bothered playing second fiddle to him , as they know that this is a Carrey film . there is a moral to the film too , think of others before you think of yourself . what i like about this film is that Carrey does what everyone would do if they were given Gods power , make sure that their life was perfect before other peoples . Bruce learns this the hard way after his hometown is thrown into turmoil following an incident with the lottery thanks to Bruces ' actions as God . a great movie , Carrey should keep making films like this .
tickle my tits til ' Friday . . .	Shirley's a middle-aged Liverpool housewife , who finds herself talking to the wall while she prepares her husband's chip'n'egg , wondering what happened to her life . She compares scenes in her current life with what she used to be like and feels she's stagnated and in a rut . But when her best friend wins an all-expenses-paid vacation to Greece for two , Shirley begins to see the world , and herself , in a different light . . . . Shirley Valentine , or your mums most favourite film , is not really one for the lads , but it is entertaining enough and well performed to keep you glued to the screen for a couple of hours . i'm sure that most middle aged women can relate to Shirley , remembering their once fruitful life and realising that life has suddenly rushed by them and they are stuck in a rut . but as the film and narration shows , Shirley dares to do what other women do not , she actually follows her dreams and does what everyone else would not dare do , live . . . basically this could be classed as escapism of the highest order , the James Bond for the middle ages woman if you may , sticking a big finger up to society and the rat race and showing that she isn't stagnant and boring . the film is funny and yet at times equally depressing , it must be hell for her husband , but this is coming from a male point of view , so i cannot help but show empathy for him , but it does make you realise what you have to appreciate . a film every lady of any age should watch , if they feel low . the Prozac of cinema . .
it's a jungle in there . . . .	A secret service agent , Jennifer Marsh , gets caught in a very personal and deadly cat-and - mouse game with a serial killer who knows that people ( being what they are - both curious and drawn to the dark side of things ) will log onto an " untraceable " website where he conducts violent and painful murders LIVE on the net . The more people who log on and enter the website , the quicker and more violently the victim dies . . . what sounds like a dreadful premise and a virtual rehash of the awful ' FEARDOTCOM ' i was pleasantly surprised at how taut and how well crafted it was up until the final fifteen minutes . as always , Lane is excellent in her role as the agent who is put in charge , and the actual ideas of the murders is quite genius , but no doubt it will be compared to ' saw ' and other films filled with gore . yes the film is gory enough to satisfy those with blood lust , but the performances and direction by Hoblit make it worth a watch . it's just a pity that with thrillers like this , the ending is rather predictable and lets you down , nice haunting last frame though . .
i believe everybody , and i believe no one . . .	The famous French detective , Inspector Jacques Clouseau , investigates the murder of a man at a country house . The owner of the house always seems to know more than he should , and although the evidence continually suggests that the maid Maria committed the crime . Clouseau always does the opposite expected of him , much to the disgruntlement of his superior , Dreyfus . . . . another great British comedian showing how comedy should be done properly . a lot of people nowadays will claim that this is pure slapstick trash , but this is a wonderful movie , full of hilarious sight gags , timing and a legendary central performance . but as the series carried on , it became as bizarre as Clouseau became more accident prone , and here although he does fall out of windows etc . , he is still quite restraint . there are some great set pieces , for instance , the nudist camp sequence is laugh out loud funny , and when Dreyfus is trying to kill Clouseau and keeps failing , is a work of genius . this has to be one of Edwards finest movies and never gets boring when seen more than once
you can't see the eyes of the demon , until him come calling . . . .	Lt . Mike Harrigan is a cop fighting the good war against drugs . But recently , the major drug lords have been killed off in a very brutal fashion . His superiors tell him to stay out of it , but Harrigan knows that something is wrong . His instincts are right when he discovers that the person behind the murders is none other than the Predator , the human-hunting alien who likes to make trophies out of his victims ' skulls . But how can Harrigan stop the Predator when it can turn invisible and kill him without him knowing it ? it was always going to be a hard act to follow the near flawlessness of McTiernans eighties classic , but putting the film ten years into the future ( erm , 1997 ) and setting it in the jungle of Los Angeles , does make up for the lack of character development and plot . the story is nearly non-existent , it's basically the Predator in town killing as many people as possible ( with real weapons ) and only Danny glover can save the day , but this time he hasn't got Riggs with him to back him up . Glover just about makes a convincing action star and does use a lot of hi traits from the lethal weapon movies ( talking to himself to calm him down etc ) but the best thing about this is obviously the Predator and his new array of weapons , which are fun and quite sadistic . the film is a lot more gorier than its predecessor , but lacks the tension and finale of that . but as sequels go , there are far worse ones than this , and it doesn't really taint the original .
what we are doing is impossible . . . . .	Three Jewish brothers escape from Nazi-occupied Poland into the Belarussian forest , where they join Russian resistance fighters and endeavour to build a village in order to protect themselves and others in danger . . . Based on a true story , or partly based , this has received some harsh criticism from the media and other affiliates , but if you can take the critique with a pinch of salt ( or shot of vodka ) there is an amazing story which is told here . Craig , Schreiber and Bell are great as the three Brothers who find solace ( pun intended ) in the woods , and soon they have a huge following , having people depend on them , and although they have all lost close ones , they stand up against the enemy and fight and survive . some of the scenes do really make you cringe though . two that spring to mind are when Craig mounts his white horse and gives a speech to the ' village ' , a little too Braveheart for my liking , and just before they find the ' Jew Lover ' hanging , the shot of the three brothers watching from a distance , is a little too ' Dad's Army for me , and was unintentionally funny . and also , the whole film had a little too much ' Robin Hood : Prince Of Thieves ' going on in some parts . little grumbles aside , it's tense and well told , the cinematography is bleak but somehow comforting , and the set pieces are well staged . it's a nice little film , which won't hurt anyones careers , but i don't think think it will win anything come awards season .
would you mind not shooting at the thermo-nuclear missile . .	Major Deakins is a tough U . S . Air Force pilot ( he puts cigarettes out with his fingers ) who is assigned to a flight mission with ' nice-guy ' Captain Hale . They are to fly the B3 Stealth Bomber on war game manoeuvres over Utah loaded with two live nuclear weapons . Deakins , having been continually passed over for promotion , sells out his country and arranges to use the thermonuclear warheads under his command to blackmail the U . S . government . The only thing standing in his way is his old buddy , Captain Hale . . . . Woo's second attempt at Hollywood , fares better than ' Hard Target ' but due to one reason only , Travolta was on top of his comeback game , and Face / off aside , this is one of his most maniacal roles he has ever played , and unfortunately for Slater ( who was trying to get bigger in Hlywood as the action star ) the film teeters on boring whenever Travolta isn't on screen . he ( wild ) hogs all the best lines and the best scenes , and does everything with a little bit more panache than everyone else , it's almost as if he has walked straight from the set of a Noel Coward play and just become a bad guy . the direction from Woo is as always beautiful , and makes the set pieces as always a symphony of chaos , which gets more exciting and ridiculous as every bullet is fired . the story is your basic Die Hard rip off , and in my opinion without the input of Travolta or Woo , this would have literally bombed . worth watching for Travolta and his eccentric turn as the bad guy .
that is not my dog . . . .	Former Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus is nearly set to be released from a mental hospital after being cleared . However , a visit from current Chief Inspector Jacques Clouseau resurrects his insanity , and he is denied leaving . Determined to take out Clouseau once and for all , he escapes and blows up Clouseau's apartment , but fails to kill Clouseau . As a back-up plan , he abducts a famous scientist in order to build a Doomsday Machine which vaporises whatever it shoots . Dreyfus threatens to use it unless Clouseau is exterminated , so reluctantly , 26 countries send their top assassin to kill the Chief Inspector . His clumsiness saves him again , and the assassin's attempts kill each other . In a conquest to save the world , Clouseau heads out to put an end to Dreyfus's terror once and for all . . . . a great entry into the series and it still feels as fresh and as funny , as when i first saw it a long time ago . it's not big , it's not clever , it's just full of silly jokes that you can see coming a mile off . but this makes it all the more funny . Sellers is fantastic as Clouseau and really knows his physical comedy . some of the set pieces are hilarious , such as the Oktoberfest scene where all the assassins are after Clouseau and kill each other . not a film to be taken seriously at all , but laugh out loud all the way .

It's all enough to make Thorson question what he has done with his life , and where he is going to go with it . whilst searching for his latest bounty Thorson starts to get menacing threats from an old bounty who is threatening to kill him . will he survive his baby's ' birth ? . . . . . in Mcqueens final film , we See him a lot different to the man he was in the sixties and seventies . this Mcqueen is self deprecating ( he is a bad driver in this movie ! ! ) and he is clearly enjoying himself making this . as a movie though the story is average , with nothing new on offer , but some of the set pieces are great , such as the shootout on the rail-line and his encounter with the sheriff's ' nephew . the film knows how to share drama with comedy , and it fuses well together , there are some laugh out loud moments and some very tense , violent moments too . a fitting tribute to the most coolest actor of the seventies .
conscience is a nuisance . . . . .	In the beginning of the Seventeenth Century , along the English colonisation of North America , Captain John Smith leaves the Jamestown fort to explore another area and trade with the Indians , but he is captured . The princess Pocahontas asks her father to spare Captain Smith's life and they fall in love for each other . When he returns to the colony , he becomes the president of Jamestown and finds people starving , but Pocahontas brings supplies , saves them and falls in disgrace with her people . When the Indians realise that the English will not leave their country , they attack and after a bloody battle , the English trade Pocahontas and lodge her in the fort to protect their families , and Captain Smith loses his position because he does not agree with the arrangement . With the return of Captain Newport , Captain Smith is promoted and sent back to England , and he asks a friend to tell Pocahontas that he drowned along the trip . Pocahontas is civilised and baptised by the English and John Rolfe proposes and marries her . Many years later , she hears that Captain Smith is alive , and she has to decide if she keeps her marriage or follows her heart . . . . . . after a six year hiatus following the thin red line , Malick returns once again to give us another slow burning drama with an impressive cast . based on fact , the film may not sit comfortably with some people due to its content , but the film is a love story plain and simple , and which the main protagonist must go through some very difficult choices , at a very early stage of her life , which is sometimes depicted with music , with cinematography , and also body language . the film is beautiful to look at and the soundtrack is one of the best ever committed to film , but sometimes the film can on a little and be a little too arty for its own good . Farrell and Bale are great in their respected roles , but it's Kilcher who steals the movie from under their noses . she depict Pocahontas with ease and is very good in her role and has great chemistry with her love rivals . but the film could have done with being trimmed by at least twenty minutes and Plummer and Bale could have been used a lot more . a beautiful film to look at , but leaves you feeling empty .
wrong bet ! ! ! !	this is another cracker from the van damme factory . he plays Leon a legionnaire who goes AWOL after discovering his brothers fate . to help his sister-in-law he decides to compete in unarmed underground street fights . this is where the similarities to bloodsport are , the animated over the top opponents , the repeated kicks from angles and the fight with the seemingly indestructible ' end of level boss'there is an element of drama in this movie , but it doesn't slow up the pace . actually the drama adds to the intensity of the movie . not one of his best by far and memorable like bloodsport or kickboxer , but still a damme fine movie
don't call me ma'am . . . .	Jay Killon is the bodyguard of the recently elected US president , but he is assigned to the first lady ( Lara Royce ) . Lara hates Killon so she does all she can to escape . The story complicates when someone tries to kill Lara . . . another quickly produced and cheaply made production from the Cannon group , but it still has all the charm of a classic b-movie . Bronson plays the exact same character he did in all his movies in the eighties , and is aided by a string of bad actors . the story is ' the bodyguard ' but five years earlier and without the big production values , and the sub-plots are ludicrous . Ireland and Bronson are fun to watch and some of ' momma ones ' lines are cheesy but fun , but what all people who even dare to rent out a cannon film from the eighties is , explosions . there a lots , and yes , they are laugh out loud funny . from the initial bike randomly blowing up to the boat , but the funniest sight in this film is Bronson , on a bike , with a machine gun and rocket launcher . pure class , and sadly the stuntman doesn't have the same colour moustache as Bronson , but he does blow up a barn . two minor quibbles though , there is one scene where they are being chased by a truck on a railway line , and the truck falls off a ledge , i did think for one second it wasn't going to blow up , but it finally did . and finally , when Bronson throws the Uzi down on the ground in the woods , he does look like he's just taken a tray out of a microwave . other than that , it's pure mindless fun .
why did you kill my teacher ? . . . .	Chen returns to the international compound of China only to learn of his beloved teacher's death . This is compounded by the continual racist harassment by the Japanese population in the area . Unlike his friends , he confronts it head on with his mastery of martial arts while investigating his teacher's murder . just a typical revenge movie , but with the added gravitas of Bruce Lee in his prime . the story is paltry and simple , as are the sets and the hairstyles , but when it come to the fight choreography , it's second to none . it does take a while to get going , but when it does , you will realise why Lee is such a legend today . a great movie .
Pierrepoint . . .	Spall plays Albert Pierrepoint , the most prolific hangman that Britain ever saw . we see him live his day to day life as a delivery man , and his darker side to his life as the hangman . when he gets asked to go to Germany to do his ' work ' there , he doesn't realise the amount of hangings he has to do . when he returns home , he is a kind of ' robin hood ' figure to a lot of the public , and others show him great anger toward him , basically calling him a murderer . but Albert doesn't think of his job as murder , he thinks of it as he is the path to forgiveness , once they meet Pierrepoint , they have paid their penalty and are forgiven . Spall plays the part of Pierrepoint very well . when he is in the normal ' world ' , he is basically Albert , a lovable person who leads a humble life as a publican , loved by his wife and has good friends , things are perfect for him . but when he is in the mode of hangman , Spall changes the persona of Albert to that of Pierrepoint , and makes him more of a soulless automaton . it's as if he totally switches off to the world , puts his all into the job he has to do , and makes sure everything is pristine . the other people who assist him are more open about their lives , regretting what they do , but Pierrepoint doesn't show regret , as he thinks he is doing the criminal / public a favour , this is what makes the movie worth watching , Spalls performance is mesmerising . it is quite a slow performance in places , with some very bizarre characters and what lets it down , is a pointless sub-plot . but the film ends on a low , and Pierrpoint breaks his persona into Albert in the final act , but only by request . an amazing film about a person who would not anything phase him
well worth the wait . . .	after almost twenty years of the t . v show , the movie finally hits theatres today . but was it worth the wait ? in church Abe Simpson has according to Homer ' a senior moment ' and talks gibberish about Springfield's impending doom . soon after this , the townsfolk realise that they are polluting the town too much ( in a little nod to an inconvenient truth ) and decide that there will be no more dumping in the river . Homer has adopted a pig and when he hears that there are free donuts going at lard boys , he hurriedly dumps the pigs waste in the river , thus causing Springfield to become the most polluted town in the country . a dome covers Springfield courtesy of president Schwarzenegger and the townsfolk try and lynch the Simpsons , who escape via a hole . they decide to move to Alaska , but when Marge hears some shocking news about Springfields fate via Tom Hanks , she decides to leave Homer and try and do something . homer knowing what he has with Marge and his family goes after them and tries to help too . . . . the film is definitely worth the two decades waiting time , and right from the beginning we are treated to some genuine laugh out loud moments , and i found myself laughing at Homer mocking the theatre audience , ala ' the TV series mocks the Fox network . i was weary about the series being turned into a film , would they be able to keep the humour up for ninety minutes ? well when the Simpsns reach Alaska , the laughs do run a little dry but the film more than makes up for it in the first and third acts . Homer and Bart surprisingly get along well until a game of dare goes awry ( believe me this shows one of the most shocking and laugh out loud moments in cinema history ! ! ) and Bart starts to confide in Flanders , who takes him under his wing . Lisa meanwhile in her little sub-plot finds love with an Irish boy named Colin , but this is underused . the first act is to basically introduce as many as the most popular characters from the show it can and try and get as many laughs in as it can and it does succeed ( theres even a message to tell you to turn your cell phone off ) . but the third act is where the movie comes into it's own and where Homer proves again that he is the foundation of the whole Simpsons phenomena , we start to sympathise with Homer ( there is one genuinely touching moment in the film that nearly bought a tear to my eye ) and egg him on in his quest . there are sight gags aplenty and maybe some i missed , but this is one of those movies that maybe will have to be seen twice to get the jokes . so all in all , it does live up to its expectations , but this is an opinion from someone who has only seen the first nine seasons , and aside from the slow second act and a few underused characters ( Burns , Smithers , Apu , Skinner ) this movie should feel fresh every time when seen as it does reference a lot of movies ( star wars and even escape from new york ) . plus the soundtrack makes the film a little more dramatic . just don't take the opening sequence to heart ! !
did i scare you mommy ?	basically made because of the release date , this is a virtual reworking of Donners classic . we all know the story , Robert Thorn is a US ambassador whose wife has ' supposedly ' lost a child . a priest at the maternity unit offers Thorn another child whose mother had died at birth . Thorn accepts this as his wife is unaware that their son died . skip to five years and now Thorn is a high profile ambassador living in London with his wife and son ' Damian ' . but things start to go awry . people are dying in freak accidents and Thorn starts to fear what he had done . . . after the debacle that was the ' reimagining ' of Psycho in 1998 , i was particularly weary of approaching this , especially with the fact that the film was made just because of it's release date . but as i have mentioned before , the original is a classic , and director Moore has not tried to better it . and the film works , set in a topical time , it brings up images of and the tsunami tragedy and successfully fuses them with the Armageddon prophecy . the same deaths and Revelations which were pivotal and socking in the original are still here and intact , so anyone who has seen the original will be in for no surprises . for the i-pod generation , there is a few dream sequences thrown into the mixture which provide a few jump and scares . Schreiber is excellent as Thorne and truly shines in his role , his expressions of anguish and confusion are fantastic . there is some great support particularly from Poslethwaite and Thewlis as the doomed priest and journalist , but the best casting has to be Mia Farrow as Damians nanny ( who else could mind the devils child other than someone who has bore the devils child in another movie ? ) overall a great remake albeit with added gore and shock scare tactics , this does not tarnish the original , but compliments it . one ' hell ' of a ' devillishly ' good move
clean out your office . . .	the second part of this amazing trilogy , stars Considine as a copper who is working on the case of the Yorkshire Ripper , but all the proceedings could have something to do with the shootings at the club in 1974 . this is probably a lot more harder to watch than the previous part , given the subject content , and although it doesn't really grip the viewer like the previous part , which was consistently brilliant , this concentrates more on the characters and there hardships . Mullen is given more screen time , and for some reason , the tension of the drama goes up a notch whenever he is on screen . Clarke is as angry as usual and Morriessy proves that he is one of Britains best talents . it really gets the viewer though once the Ripper is caught , and it's really haunting and uneasy when he is being interviewed by the police , as he appears just like a ' normal ' person , detailing his killings like he was having a chat with someone about football at the local . but this is when the penny drops , when he says no to one of the girls names called out , it's back to the plot of 1974 and the corruption . the ending is as bleak as 1974 , and leaves you wanting more and more .
he's not a boy , he's a lethal weapon ! !	Alex Rider is not like every other 14 year old boy . his parents died when he was very young and he lives with his Uncle Ian , who he rarely sees as he is always away on business . he is looked after by Jack , his nanny of nine years and they share a close friendship . tragedy happens when Ian is killed in a car accident , but after the funeral , Alex discovers that what his Uncle told him about the job he did was a complete falsification and that all the adventure weekends and martial arts classes that Ian took Alex to , were part of his training . Ian in fact was a spy and now Alex has to step into his shoes before psychopathic villain Darrius Sayle unleashes a virus that could potentially kill millions of people . having never read the Alex Rider books , i entered this movie unaware of what was in store . of course i knew that this would be a kind of James Bond lite , but ever since i heard about the production i was always intrigued with the impressive cast line up . the one thing that marred my confidence in the movie was the director , Sax . having seen his previous movie White Noise , i did have reservations about the film . but hen again the writer of the novel wrote the screenplay , so it would be his vision more or less on the screen . how delighted i was at his movie . it was everything it was hyped up to be and is the beginning of a potentially great franchise . the film is short in it's running time , but it fit's the story in perfectly . the narration of the film is unbeatable and they have found the perfect foil in Alex Pettyfer . the cinematography too can put a lot of the big budget movies and epics to shame in some scenesthe film is obviously a homage to Bond , ( primarily Goldfinger and the spy who loved me ) with it's array of caricatures from previous bond films . there is even a pre-credits sequence like Bond too . Bill Nighy is fantastically camp as the ' M ' type character , with his deadpan timing , twitches and a surprising cold streak . Stephen fry too is very good as the ' Q ' branch type person and has some great lines . the film not only homages Bond but also . . True Lies Teen agent / Iflooks could kill XXXas always there are a few minor niggles such as1 . a lot of the time you can really tell the difference between the real Alex Rider and his stunt double 2 . the soundtrack music tends to use a lot of pop songs , and they feel out of place . 3 . product placement is clearly evident in a few scenes . 4 . there are a few plot holes and the final few moments between Rider and Gregorovich are frankly , bafflingbut that doesn't affect the standard of the movie on show here . there are some great set pieces . for instance the scene between Jack and Nadia Vole having a fight uses clips from TV shows to indicate violence and it is highly original , and the final set piece above Sayles building is breathtaking and uses the London skyline to great effect . all in all a great film for all the family which is very easy on the eye and has great action for children and some great lines for adults ( great innuendo from Sayles ! ) . catch it now .
sometimes nothings enough . . . .	Eric Bana stars in this drama with the best name for a cinema character ever , Huck Cheever , a gambler who is living in his fathers shadow . he spends most of his time in Las Vegas casinos playing against amateur poker players to earn a little cash . the only thing is , Huck is known as a blaster , someone who just won't fold his cards , his greatest adversary is his father , or is it himself ? the film leads up to the poker world series , and along the way he meets up with Drew Barrymore who does little else in this film than act little kooky and get mad with Huck in one scene . directed with very much flair by Hanson , nothing really happens much in the movie , but it's the array of characters and their tics that makes the film so involving for its duration , with a great cameo from Robert Downey Jr . as one of Hucks friends ( or people who will lend him money ) bana is fantastic as Cheever , and you do really care for his character and his issues with his father . Duvall also plays a great role , probably one of his best this decade , and grabs the movie from under Bana whenever he is on screen . the only weak link is Barrymore , who does very little in the film apart fro looking sweet and speaking lines like they have been taken from fortune cookies . but overall this film is terribly underrated and is a great drama and quite intense in some scenes . well worth watching .
big mouth don't make a big man . . . .	When his cattle drivers abandon him for the gold fields , rancher Wil Andersen is forced to take on a collection of young boys as his drivers in order to get his herd to market in time to avoid financial disaster . The boys learn to do a man's job under Andersen's tutelage , however , neither Andersen nor the boys know that a gang of cattle thieves is stalking them . . the film starts off in familiar Western territory , an aged Wayne with his wife on a ranch with the near impossible job of moving a herd of cows over four hundred miles does not sound like the most exhilarating film ever made . but with the addition of the titular gang , we see a different side to the character Wayne is most famous for , the grizzled Cowboy who punches first and asks questions later . they become more or less his surrogate children and despite the fact that they don't all hit it off at first , the predictable turn in the narration is soon imminent . the cast are all great as is the cinematography , especially in hi-def , but it's Wayne who makes the film such an enjoyable movie . well worth watching , and as i'd never heard of the film before , a very tear jerking movie in some ways . recommended .
superman doesn't smoke . . . .	An exploration of fame and identity , inspired by one of Hollywood's most infamous real-life mysteries . June 16 , 1959 . The glamour of Tinseltown permanently fades for actor George Reeves , the heroic Man of Steel on TV's Adventures of Superman , as the actor dies in his Hollywood Hills home . Felled by a single gunshot wound , Reeves leaves behind a fiancée - aspiring starlet Leonore Lemmon - and millions of fans who are shocked by his death . But it is his grieving mother , Helen Bessolo , who will not let the questionable circumstances surrounding his demise go unaddressed . Helen seeks justice , or at least answers . The Los Angeles Police Department closes the case , but Helen hires - for $50 a day - private detective Louis Simo . Simo soon ascertains that the torrid affair Reeves had with Toni Mannix , the wife of MGM studio executive Eddie Mannix , might hold the key to the truth . But truth and justice are not so easily found in Hollywood . Simo pursues dangerous and elusive leads in both high and low places and , in trying to turn up the heat , risks getting burned . The detective also uncovers unexpected connections to his own life as the case turns more personal and he learns more about Reeves himself . . . . after first seeing the movie , you can see the resemblance to other period pieces such as the black dahlia and L . A confidential . now as these films had totally different stories , ' Hollywoodlad ' has captured the period exceptionally well and it has been made on a noir type scale . how true the story is is of no concern , as this is one of those stories that will have different conspiracies , coming out of the wall , and while the movie may not ' open any can of worms ' it's quite humbling to know why watching the movie that someone out there knows the truth . all the cast are great in their roles , but Affleck has never been better as the tormented Reeves , and while he is not on the screen , the film seems to be missing something . Affleck could be so good because he seems so effortless in his performance , whereas films such as Jersey Girl and even Gigli , he seemed to be trying too hard , which tarnished his role , but here , just perfect . Lane and Brody are great too and add real depth to the story . if you like noir type films , or are into conspiracies then this is for you . well worth checking out .
have fun . . . .	In order to get out of hock with mobster Billy Walker , restaurateur-turned - " retrieval expert " Beck has to go down to Brazil and retrieve Billy's ne'er-do-well archaeologist-wannabe son Travis , who is searching for an ancient gold idol called the Gato del Diablo . This idol is prized by not only the local population as the path to their salvation , but by Cornelius Hatcher , slave-driving operator of the Helldorado mining town who oppresses said population in the name of profits , and Hatcher just won't let Beck leave with Travis . . . . . It's an action film with The Rock and it shows just what a good direction he is going in his movie career . it starts off very good and rarely loses it's energy throughout , although the first act really does have that much excitement in it , it takes a lot more later on in the film for it to live up to the nightclub opening ( pretty much thanks to Arnies little cameo , which is more or less a subliminal message of him passing the action Baton to the rock ) . it's over the top ridiculous , but if you are a fan of early nineties action , particular straight to video fodder , then you will find lots to enjoy about it . the two leads are pretty solid together , although i think there could have been a little bit more banter between the two instead of Beck repeatedly saying ' Move it ' and ' Shut your mouth ' . as always there are some predictable moments , for instance , when they have a little conversation about firearms , and Becks confession that ' Very Bad Things happen ' when he uses them , you know that is exactly what he will use in the final set piece . the visuals are quite impressive , as is some of the camera-work . it's an adrenaline junkies movie , full of laughs , good fights and randy Monkeys . worth watching .
my rings outside . . . . . . .	Rocky Balboa is forced to retire after having permanent damage inflicted on him in the ring by the Russian boxer Ivan Drago . Returning home after the Drago bout , Balboa discovers that the fortune that he had acquired as heavyweight champ has been stolen and lost on the stock market by his accountant . His boxing days over , Rocky begins to coach an up-and-coming fighter named Tommy Gunn . Rocky cannot compete , however , with the high salaries and glittering prizes being offered to Gunn by other managers in town . . . . . . rocky goes back to his original roots in this fifth instalment of the series , also starring his son Sage , the film is more aimed at his family life and his struggles rather than his boxing career . when we first meet Gunn , Rocky is reluctant to help him , but finally succumbs to Gunns pleas and takes him in to his family's home . this is a great move by Stallone and Avildsen as it makes the final third a lot more powerful . as Rocky starts to turn his attention to Gunn , he ignores his family in favour of his protégé ' . when Gunn turns against Rocky , you really feel for Rocky , as he has always learnt that the sport isn't about the money , but about the heart . OK , sometimes the script isn't up to much , and characters who are regularly in the series ( such as Duke ) are pushed to the side , but Stallone knows how to pull the audiences heart strings . the rest of the cast are good , but this is a really good film in the series and unfairly treated when first released . OK , it doesn't have the montage and there is no belt to win at the end , but the Rocky heart is still there , and the return of Mickey is the cherry on the cake . a great movie
the guy who discovers that perpetual dream , he's my man . . .	Gary Shaller is at a crossroads in his life : his job is going nowhere , his wife , Dora , drives him crazy , and he passed his thirtieth birthday four years ago . Add to that his best friend Paul seems to become more successful every time he breathes . Gary is feeling depressed and dejected . . . until he meets Anna . She's beautiful and smart ; she's sexy and funny . Best of all , she's crazy about Gary . Anna is the girl of Gary's dreams . . . literally . And that's the problem . Gary can only see Anna in his dream life , so he's got to find a way to carry on the most satisfying relationship of his life , in his dreams . His quest for lucid dreaming techniques introduces Gary to some crazy characters who ultimately give him a new perspective on life . . . . it amazes me that films that are so original like this , are sometimes hidden under the radar , when other movies that rehash other plots or are high profile remakes , get such publicity and are pushed in your face at any given opportunity . the stellar cast are great here , Freeman plays again , your everyday average Joe , who aspires to be something different and to be someone different , albeit via his dreams . his life isn't that bad , he's got Gwyneth Paltrow as a wife , and he has a good job in New York , but he still yearns for something else . the dream sequences are not as psychedelic as you would expect to find in a movie , but are ' dreamy ' to a certain extent . it's good to see Pegg play against type for once as his sleazy friend , and not playing a typical Englishman as seen in previous roles . as life imitates art , the film is more interesting when we are the voyeur to the dreams , and the soundtrack is amazing too . the story is great and it has a bitter ending . we don't know who for , but to delve into it any deeper would give the ending away . a charming film that is well worth seeking out .
are we still shooting ?	In the days immediately after the Gulf War , a group of American soldiers come across a secret Iraqi map , which discloses the whereabouts of a bunker where Iraq is storing stolen gold and treasure from Kuwait . The soldiers hope to take the gold and keep it for themselves . However , when they arrive at the site , they discover that the Iraqi army is more concerned about persecuting its civilians than stopping them from stealing the gold . They learn that the civilians have been encouraged by the U . S . government to rise up and fight Saddam Hussein , but are facing certain execution because the U . S . military refuses to help them . This incident creates a crisis of conscience for the American soldiers . Do they take the money and run , leaving the civilians to face certain death at the hands of the Iraqi army ? Or do they risk losing the gold in order to escort them to safety across the border into Iran ? a great satirical poke about the gulf war and how in some peoples eyes , it was all for greed rather than good . rife with Saddams propaganda throughout , the film is immaculate in narration and constantly laugh out loud funny ( thanks to Jonze ) . the rest of the cast are good , even though Cube is a little out of place in this move . there are some shocking scenes , the torture scene featuring the subliminal imagery is shocking , and the use of camerwork and effects during some of the stand offs are timeless . not really a war movie , more of an anti-war message , the film is more notorious now for the feud between Clooney and Russell , but still worth watching
what will your children say about you . . . .	A political thriller : the real-life story of a South African hero's journey to freedom . In the country's turbulent and divided times in the 1980s , Patrick Chamusso is an oil refinery foreman and soccer coach who is apolitical - until he and his wife Precious are jailed . Patrick is stunned into action against the country's oppressive reigning system , even as police Colonel Nic Vos further insinuates himself into the Chamussos ' lives . Noyce knows how to direct a good political thriller / drama , and has made no exception here . what starts off as genuinely intriguing moving picture about one mans innocence , turns into a nightmarish journey for Patrick , as he loses everything he had good in he life just to prove a point . whilst watching the film , you show great empathy for both the leads , thinking that Robbins character is actually a caring person toward these people , but in the end he is just doing his job and to find answers . he doesn't care about these people or their plight , he just wants accolade , which in turn , makes him a bitter man . on hindsight , when there are the family scenes , they are quite haunting , because there is no happiness there , unlikes Patrick's community . overall the film is thrilling , and very difficult to watch at times , but the story is laid out well and the production value , cinematography and performances are outstanding .
he won't get far on hot air and fantasy . . .	in the final part of Gilliams ' life ' trilogy , the move tells the fantastic tale of a 17th century aristocrat , his talented henchmen and a little girl in their efforts to save a town from defeat by the Turks . by going on an exasperating adventure , via the moon , avoiding the grim reaper , finding youth , dancing with Venus , irking Vulcan , and being swallowed by a sea monster , Munchausen never gives up his quest to help the villagers from the Turks . after all , it's his fault the Turks and the Sulten are a little angry . . . from the upstart , it is clear to see that the director is almost as deluded as the titular character , but that isn't a criticism , this has to be one of the most courageous and difficult films to be made . it is visually stunning , sparing no expense on the grand sets , be it the war torn village , to the obsolete , almost dystopian vision of the moon , probably one of the most visually stunning moments int the movie is when the ship is sailing on the moon . the characters are amazing and almost pythonesque , some are sad pathetic creatures and others are laugh out loud flights of fantasy , the titular character is played to good effect by Neville , who mixes a little Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone into his character . but he just isn't about about fantastical stories , this is a man who is literally running away from death and seeking your youth . this film could almost be about regret , as the old saying goes ' it's better regret something you have done , than regret something you haven't'maybe Munchausen never did avail to anything in his life , and just before his ' death ' wanted one more shot at holding an audience ' his fifteen minutes of fame ' if you will . but this is a delightful movie , filled with so much joy and with so much love and respect poured into the project , it's almost impossible not to find something that will catch your attention . a great family film , and also a very deep movie with a underlying meaning to the whole thing . . . life that is . almost ! ! !
Don't lose your blob . . . .	1984 : In a northern England mining town , miners are on strike and the atmosphere is tense . Eleven-year old Billy Elliot , whose father and brother are participating in the strike , whose mother has died quite some time ago and whose grandmother is not completely aware of what's going on , doesn't like the brutal boxing lessons at school . Instead , he falls for the girls ' ballet lessons . When his folks find out about this unusual love of his , Billy is in trouble . Being supported by the ballet teacher , Mrs . Wilkinson , he keeps on training secretly while the work situation as well as the problems at home get worse . Finally , Mrs . Wilkinson manages to get Billy an audition for the Royal Ballet School , but now he also has to open his heart to his family . . . Portraying one boys struggle to be different in a time , when every miner was struggling to cope with ' Change ' is a great idea for a movie . it's gritty from beginning to end , with the message ' there can be light at the end of the tunnel , if you follow your dream ' . Bell is amazing as the titular character , knowing that his family are on breaking point and telling his family he wants to be a dancer , would tip them over the edge . all the support are fantastic , and with the exception of a ' footloose ' style angry dance , the film is flawless . it's sad in parts , funny in others , but always keeping the sub-plot of the miners strike very close to the main plot , which gives it the edge over other ' feel good ' pictures . an amazing movie from start to finish , it's just a shame they had to put an angry dance in there .
the least you can do is drive her home . . . .	Lloyd Hopkins , a hard-boiled American police detective is on the trail of a mass murderer who is victimising women in Los Angeles . The pursuit leads him through a world that has become his own natural habitat - a nasty world of crime , drugs , prostitution and male hustlers where " innocence kills " and continued exposure corrupts . Paradoxically , it's also a world of love , secret admirers , romantic feminist poets and modern chivalry . . . in the late eighties , if a film was released under the plain and simple title ' Cop ' it wouldn't have got much recognition , because the majority of people would have thought it would have been another plain action movie . and in the world of Norris , Bronson , and dozens of other action stars it would have sunk without a trace . but when you look closer and actually sit back and watch the movie , it's an absolute blast at the police and how there system sometimes needs to bend the rules . beautifully written and very well acted , especially by Woods , ' Cop ' resembles Eastwoods 1984 thriller tightrope , but is more tense and enjoyable than that movie . the plot and narrative intertwine and is very involving and the murders , while are gory , do not burn an image in your mind . the only bad thing about this film is the final set piece , that could have been put in any action movie , and lets the cleverness of it down a little . but still a cracking movie .
wind in the hair , lead in the pencil . . . . .	Aurora and Emma are mother and daughter who march to different drummers . Beginning with Emma's marriage , Aurora shows how difficult and loving she can be . The movie covers several years of their lives as each finds different reasons to go on living and find joy . Aurora's interludes with Garrett Breedlove , retired astronaut and next door neighbour are quite striking . In the end , different people show their love in very different ways . i wish i wasn't so curious and demanded a friend of mine to tell me the ending , because while watching and really enjoying the performances and struggles of all the characters involved , i couldn't help but having the inevitable ending in the back of my head throughout the duration . but the film is near flawless and the performances from all the main cast are fantastic , especially Maclaine and Nicholson , as the bickering neighbours . it wears it's heart on it's sleeve and Brooks proves that he is a good story maker and can make a great film . such a film to watch in whatever mood your in , it will bring a smile and tears to you throughout .
i made my family disappear . . . . .	8-year-old Kevin McAllister is accidentally left behind when his family takes off for a vacation in France over the holiday season . Once he realises they've left him home by himself , Kevin learns to fend for himself , and eventually has to protect his house against bumbling burglars Harry and Marv , who are planning to rob every house in Kevin's suburban Chicago neighbourhood . Kevin's mother Kate is frantic when she realises that she and the family have unintentionally left Kevin behind in Chicago , and she tries to make it back to Chicago as fast as she can . . . the ultimate Christmas movie for any young child and any big kids out there . we all know that the best thing about this movie is the final act with the traps etc etc , but the build up is something very good and should not be overlooked . obviously being aimed at children , there are some flaws to the plot , first of all , HOW could anyone forget their child ? but this is Hollywood so it can possibly happen . and all the serious stuff to do with actually leaving a child at home ' alone ' . surely the police would have had a little bit more input in the situation , but this is purely trivial . the film is owned by Culkin and proves to be less annoying than you originally thought , but this movie is more than just him , look at the movie and see how many different characters there are and the lines they have , and most of all how all these characters are pivotal to the films plot . the elderly couple at the airport , the old woman and the young boy in the shop ( when Kevin steals the toothbrush ) ' chris Kringle ' his elf old man Marley and Kevin's extended familyall these characters make an impact to the movie and are remembered when seen again . this is a classic movie with an extended variety of character play and the importance of family and the love and protection they provide youngsters , not just two robbers , one kid and a house of fun ! ! the only let down is the ending , which is too sugary and sweet for my liking , which some families may adore about films like this , but it just doesn't stick well with the film . otherwise a classic Christmas movie that is an ideal movie to watch with the whole family , just before you watch ' it's a wonderful life'great stuff
you wouldn't like me when i'm hungry . . .	A cure is in reach for the world's most primal force of fury : THE INCREDIBLE HULK . We find scientist Bruce Banner , living in shadows , scouring the planet for an antidote . But the warmongers who dream of abusing his powers won't leave him alone , nor will his need to be with the only woman he has ever loved , Betty Ross . Upon returning to civilisation , our brilliant doctor is ruthlessly pursued by The Abomination - - a nightmarish beast of pure adrenaline and aggression whose powers match The Hulk's own . A fight of comic-book proportions ensues as Banner must call upon the hero within to rescue New York City from total destruction . . more of a side-quel to Lee's 2003 movie , this features an all new cast , all new hulk , and importantly , a knowing sense of it's own limitations . Norton is an odd choice to play banner , and some times in the film you can almost feel that he is uncomfortable playing such a character , knowing his prolific track record . the film though has lot's of great characters , in particular Thunderbolt Ross , and Tim Roth who chews up scenery with glee as Banners adversary . the film is fun to watch , with several references to the comic book and the TV show . the effects are good , but during the climatic battle , they can become a little overpowering a'la Van Helsing . And who in their right mind would let the hulk speak . the editing is great , and makes the film move at swift steady pace . if you were disappointed with the 2003 version , due to lack of action , then this is the version for you . mindless entertainment , with good performances from all concerned .
if you want peace , prepare for war . . . . . .	Frank Castle is a man who has seen too much death . On his final assignment , Castle plays his undercover role perfectly , but the operation spins out of control and a young man , Bobby Saint , is inadvertently killed . Inflamed by the death of their son , the Saints are willing to risk their newfound legitimacy on a wholesale mission of blood-vengeance . Castle's worst nightmare is about to come true , as Howard Saint and his lieutenants unleash hell at the Castle family reunion . But Castle , to his everlasting torment , survives . Until this moment , he has spent his entire life adhering strictly to the law . However , experience has taught him that the law cannot adequately penalise the people who murdered his family . Drawing upon all he has learned in 20 years , Castle sets in motion a plan to punish the murderers . . . . . another Marvel adaptation hits our screens , and to be fair this isn't as bad as it was reviewed on release . the movie isn't your typical Marvel adaptation , as castle has no special powers and is just looking for his own vengeance and not looking out for anyone else ( in this movie anyway ) . Jane makes Castle real as he puts in a great performance as the heavy drinking , tormented titular character . but no film like this would be enjoyable if there wasn't a suitable villain in it and Travolta goes back to his Face / Off roots to play villain Saint . although he isn't in the film very much , whenever he is on screen , his camp villainy takes over the film and ups the ante . even Patton is good in his role and the rest of the villains are your typical quickly dispatced black wearing thugs . there are some fun set pieces , a little humour and one-liners thrown in to the mixture , and a great fist fight with a huge Russian which will have you laughing and wincing at the same time . comparing it though to the Lundgren version though is difficult as the story is told from a different perspective . not your typical superhero movie , but more or less your typical action movie . worth watching .
you gonna be alright ? ?	Pete made a promise to the titular character , that if he should die , he wanted Pete to bury him in his own town . when Estrada is fatally wounded by border patrol guard mike , and is buried in a paupers grave , Pete decides to make good of the promise . he Kidnaps mike and makes him go on the long arduous journey back to Estradas hometown . along the way they discover revenge , redemption friendship and loyalty . . . what Tommy lee Jones has done here is something fantastic . he has made a western in the old school style , sometimes so retro that when you hear cell phones and see plasma TV's , you have to rub your eyes . a heavy sub-plot involving alienation is evident as Peppers character experiences what some people would call ' what goes around , comes around . the cinematography is stunning and there is great support from January Jones and Dwight Yoakam . it is very funny in places and also a very heart wrenching drama , but Jones never forgets the Western roots and makes a film that Peckinpah and Eastwood would be proud of . the screenplay is flawless and narrative , though sometimes confusing at the start , is excellent toward the end . a real underrated gem
i'm going to be a little late today . . . .	In Bangkok , after celebrating a drinking party with his closest friends , the photographer Tun and his girlfriend Jane have a car accident on the road , with Jane hitting a girl . Tun does not allow her to help the girl and they run away leaving the girl lying on the road . When Tun reveals his latest pictures , he finds some mysterious shadows , while the couple is systematically haunted by the ghost of the girl . Tun investigates and finds that the victim was his former shy and weird girlfriend Natre , who studied with him in the college . Later Jane discloses deep and hidden secrets about the relationship of Natre , Tun and his friends . even though the film is highly original , and very disturbing in places , whilst watching it you cannot help but compare it to ' ju-on ' and ' ringu ' , as its your classic horror that builds up slowly to the finale . the story and narrative are good , as are the scares , that sometimes do really put dread in you as it's quite a common subject matter . as for the ending , it kind of depends what mood your'e in . it will either make you howl with laughter or terrify the pants off you . i was kind of in-between , but enjoyable and scary never the less .
how can you value something you never had ? . . .	A drama based on the true story of Melvin B . Tolson , a professor at Wiley College Texas . In 1935 , he inspired students to form the school's first debate team , which went on to challenge Harvard in the national championship . . Washington's second effort at directing is a far better achievement than Antwone Fisher . mixing the likes of Dead poets Society and in sorts Missipi Burning , what Washington has done has made an uplifting , if sometimes very emotional drama . some could argue that this is a vanity project for the actor as he does get the most screen time and the big chunks of script that could only be achieved believable by an Oscar winner . but the film is almost stolen from under him by the three titular characters , they are absolutely stunning on screen when they are debating and make what some people perceive to be a boring concept , into something nail biting . Whitaker is good in his role , but it is very short and his character isn't looked to in depth . otherwise this is an excellent drama that has to be seen
Viktor , she made you . . . .	The career of a disillusioned producer , who is desperate for a hit , is endangered when his star walks off the film set . Forced to think fast , the producer decides to digitally create an actress " Simone " to sub for the star - - the first totally believable synthetic actress . The " actress " becomes an overnight sensation , with a major singing career as well , and everyone thinks she's a real person . However , as Simone's fame skyrockets , he cannot bear to admit his fraud to himself or the world . . . after writing such interesting movies like , the Truman show and gattaca , Niccol has delivered another great movie , about smoke and mirrors , and the risks that those involved will take to keep everything a secret . Pacino is on top form here as the endearing Viktor , and performs best when he is in his ' schizophrenic ' stage conversing to himself as Simone . it's genius to see a man take himself so seriously as a female and then have a heart to heart with himself , trying to justify why his life went wrong . the story is cracking as is the cinematography and lighting , which gives the film an almost 50's noir feel to it . it's lighthearted all the way , never to funny to be a comedy , yet never too serious to be a drama . it's a great way to spend two hours in an afternoon , the writing is first rate , as are much of the cast . unfairly overlooked when first released , this is the kind of film that you are reluctant to watch , but glad you did after the credits roll .
he was just another drifter who broke the law . . . .	John Rambo is a Vietnam net who is visiting an old friend who he served with . when he learns that his friend had died of cancer , Rambo is devastated , but leaves his respect with the mother and goes on his way . walking into a town , just like any other , he is approached by Sheriff Teasle , who takes an instant dislike to the man . when he drops Rambo off at the ' border ' of the town , Rambo decides to turn back and head into town . it's a free country and Rambo fought for his country , so he should be shown a little respect just like everyone else , right ? wrong . Rambo is arrested for carrying a weapon and decides to play it quiet in the police station , much to the dismay of the other officers . Rambo gets a beating from the cops and starts to flashback when he was being tortured in ' Nam . Rambo escapes and heads for the hills . with the police on his back and only Samuel Trautman to aide him , Rambo becomes a fugitive with a vendetta . with Rocky and this , Stallone made his name as one of the most bankable stars of the eighties . people may laugh now when you say that you are a Stallone fan because he has made a fair few turkeys . but this is Stallone at the top of his game , a gripping thriller , with tense set pieces and a great cast . you could discuss the fact that Rambo is agitated because he has just lost one of his closest friends and this is why the emotion of the war all comes back to him , or the fact that because ' Nam was a farcical war , the citizens of the country became ignorant to the fact that they lost a lot of Americans in the war , and why should they respect soldiers that ' lost ' a war . very grittily filmed and very dark in places , this film has caused controversy in the UK for it's violence and use of weaponry , but the media has to blame something don't they ? tarnished by it's sequels , this movie still feels fresh 25 years after it's release , a very topical movie about soldiers and we show great sympathy for Rambo when he is hiding in the woods . an unforgettable movie , Stallone at his best .
names is for tombstones baby . . . . . .	When Bond investigates the murders of three fellow agents , he soon finds himself a target , evading the vicious assassins as he closes in on the powerful Kananga . Known as " Mr . Big , " Kananga is coordinating a globally threatening scheme using tons of self-produced heroin . As Bond tries to unravel the mastermind's plan , he meet Solitaire , the beautiful Tarot card reader whose magical gifts are crucial to the crime lord . Bond , of course , works his own magic on her , and the stage is set for pulse-pounding action sequences involving voodoo , hungry crocodiles and turbo-charged speedboats . . . a great introduction for Moore as bond . the opening sequence before the title music isn't the best , but what we get for the rest of the film is probably one of Moores best efforts as the secret agent . the producers of the movie knew what time they where living in , as the film almost verges on blaxpoitatiion , and in some cases is very racist to some individuals . but what the viewer cannot forget is that this was the new introduction to a bond after the legend that was Connery . and the franchise does not falter one bit . Moore is fantastic as Bond , tongue firmly in cheek throughout the movie , he brings a breath of fresh air to the franchise , and the gadgets are great even if Q does not make an appearance in this movie . highlights include the great speedboat chase , the inventive henchmen ( Baron Samedi , Tee - hee , and whisper ) and the all knowing voodoo theme throughout . Kotto isn't the best bond villain out there , but his is about Moore , and he serves Connery well in stepping in his shoes . a great Bond movie .
i want a really big gun that holds a lot of bullets . .	George Kuffs didn't finish high-school , just lost his job and his girlfriend who still is in college is pregnant . Since he can't see how he can support her , he thinks she is better off without him . So he visits his elder brother , Brad , to squeeze him for a loan so he can go to Brazil where there's a gold-rush going on . Unfortunately Brad is killed and George is suddenly the owner of Brad's " patrol special " . . . it's a simple premise , Christian Slater as a cop , breaking the fourth wall and spewing one liners to make all the teenage girls go weak at the knees , and it works , very well . i possibly have a love for this movie because i was 13 when i first saw this , and this was a time when these sort of films got quite a big release over here in the UK . Slater is at the top of his game here , the guy could do no wrong at this point , with Pump Up The Volume , and Robin Hood Behind him , he was quite the hot property in the teen market . the story isn't up to much , in a way , it sort of copies the Hard Way , but it's just too silly a film to dislike . it's Slaters movie all the way , and i doubt if it would be as good if Slater wasn't in it .
little Nellie got a hot reception . . .	The US and Soviet Russia reach a new crisis when Jupiter 16 , a US space capsule , is captured in Earth orbit by a strange rocket ship . The US accuses the Soviets of the space hijacking , even though Great Britain believes the alien ship landed in the Sea Of Japan . Her Majesty's Secret Service now swings into action by " killing " James Bond in Hong Kong - a ruse so Bond can move about Japan unmolested by his enemies . Working with , and enjoying the exotic hospitality of , Japanese SIS and its commander " Tiger " Tanaka , James uncovers evidence that a major chemical company is smuggling liquid oxygen for rocket fuel . His and Tanaka's investigation leads to an extinct volcano that is the source of the space hijacking - just as a Soviet spacecraft is grabbed by the alien rocket and a previously scheduled US launch is pushed upward with America's strategic forces on full battle alert , forcing James and Tanaka to confront the true source of the space hijackings - SPECTRE , and its ruthless leader Ernst Stavro Blofeld . . . one of Connerys best and brightest bond movies . pretty much gone is his very sadistic side seen in the first two entries , and we get more quips and a bit more of a cheeky side to bond this time . the set pieces are a marvel in this film , especially the little Nellie sequence and the volcano siege . as always , the story , isn't the best , and just involves Bond going from location to location , and being a bit bolshy , but what else would you expect from him ? Blofeld is fantastic , but isn't in it for very long , but Pleasence really gets the character down to a tee as he is very chilling , calm , but ruthless , and has pet piranhas ! ! it's a great bond movie , one of Connerys best and one of the most understated entries into the series . not the best place to start , but worthy of watching , once you get into the series .
i am reality . . . . . .	Chris Taylor is a young , naive American who gives up college and volunteers for combat in Vietnam . Upon arrival , he quickly discovers that his presence is quite nonessential , and is considered insignificant to the other soldiers , as he has not fought for as long as the rest of them and felt the effects of combat . Chris has two commanding officers , the ill-tempered and indestructible Staff Sergeant Robert Barnes and the more pleasant and cooperative Sergeant Elias Grodin . A line is drawn between the two officers and a number of men in the platoon when an illegal killing occurs during a village raid . As the war continues , Chris himself draws towards psychological meltdown . And as he struggles for survival , he soon realises he is fighting two battles , the conflict with the enemy and the conflict between the men within his platoon . . . . . . knowing that this is based on Stones time in Vietnam adds to the harsh reality that the film is already delivering throughout . the film is very layered , and has several meanings after multiple viewings . on one account , this is an angry outcry of a pointless war , where many a man lost his life due to politics and / or discrimination , institutionalised murder , if you will . on another level , the film depicts the American troops as the enemy , as the invader , especially during the village raid scenes . some people may deny this , some patriots may scoff , but everybody can be pushed too far . and finally as Sheens narration explains at the end of the movie , the VC were not the enemy , the enemy were within themselves , with Barnes and Elias at constant loggerheads during the movie , the good and evil of America , the devil and god fighting in purgatory . the performances are incredible from all involved and Stone has made a masterpiece , probably his finest film to date . it's a labour of ? love for him , as he clearly wants to send a message out with this film . sometimes difficult to watch , but a must see .
hey you guuuuys ! ! ! ! ! ! !	The Goonies are a group of friends living in a village , the group leader Mikey , his older brother Brand and gang members Andy , Data , Stef , Mouth , and Chunk are being evicted from their homes which are to be demolished . Setting out to find a way of saving their homes , They find a treasure map and they set off in search for the treasure of the legendary pirate One-Eyed Willy which is located beneath a abandoned restaurant . Joined by a deformed giant named Sloth , The Goonies embark on a great adventure through a underground maze filled with traps and skeletons , where they are pursued by Sloth's mother , thief Momma Fratelli and his brothers Jake and Francis who are also after One-Eyed Willy's treasure and they willing to get the treasure first . . . the eighties gave us so many guilty pleasures , and between the years of 84 and 85 , the best were released , and the majority of them had Spielberg involved . this is no exception , way over the top plot , great set pieces and a great cast equal one of the best family adventures of the eighties . it just feels like a kids own adventure whilst watching it and it hasn't aged much in the 22 years since it's release ( although the principal cast have ! ! ) . with references to Gremlins and the adventures of the thirties , the Goonies just proves what redundant blockbusters can be produced under the influence of CGI . Brilliant
let me sleep . . . . . .	Sent from the city to investigate the murder of a teenage girl in a small Alaska town , a police detective accidentally shoots his own partner while trying to apprehend a suspect . Instead of admitting his guilt , the detective is given an unexpected alibi , but this " solution " only multiplies the emotional complexity and guilt over his partner's death . He's also still got a murder to solve , in addition to the blackmail and framing of an innocent bystander being orchestrated by the man they were chasing . There's also a local detective who is conducting her own personal investigation . . . of his partner's death . Will it all come crashing down on him ? Nolan makes great use of the setting and the fact that it never gets dark at Nightmute as an integral part of the story , and has gained three wonderful performances from Pacino , Williams and Swank , who is underused in my opinion , but still good nevertheless . as Pacino slowly starts to suffer from his sleep depravity , the camera-work becomes more vivid and visceral , showing the audience what it may be like to suffer with Pacino . we are given the question , is it through guilt , or the lack of darkness that is preventing dormer to sleep ? Williams ' character plays on this disability and becomes the character to sympathise for as the story unfolds . his act was a crime of passion , whilst Pacinos was more selfish , was he covering up his partners death , to solve the case more quickly , or to cover his own back . the narration is fantastic , the cinematography is stark and cold , and the film has that Nolan sheen to it . a really good thriller , worth watching . just don't lose any sleep over it !
in this life you can lose everything you love . . . .	Estranged from his daughter and unable to sustain any real relationships , Randy lives for the thrill of the show and the adoration of his fans . However , a heart attack forces him into retirement . As his sense of identity starts to slip away , he begins to evaluate the state of his life - - trying to reconnect with his daughter , and striking up a blossoming romance with an exotic dancer who is ready to start a new life . Yet all this cannot compare to the allure of the ring and passion for his art , which threatens to pull Randy " The Ram " back into his world of wrestling . it's a predictable thing to say , but Mickey Rourke has excelled in one of his greatest roles to date . just how much of ' The Ram ' reflects on his real life struggles is a good point to strike conversation , he looks bad , rough and puts his all into his character . his relationship with his daughter and the scenes they share are touching and bitter , but the scenes with Rourke and Tomei have a depressing edge to them , when you are watching the movie , you realise that these are two people who are coming to the end of their respective careers , and have nothing to fall back on . it's all very depressing stuff , but it's well told , well filmed , well acted , and well directed by Aronofsky . it's the kind of film that makes you realise that you should get out there and do something with your life , it's a film about reflection and coming to terms with mans biggest enemy . . . time . a must see
Mr wales , we have a thing in this country called justice !	when peaceful Missouri homesteader Josey Wales ' family an home are destroyed by a band of pro-union Jayhawkers . he is driven to revenge and becomes a Jesse James type character , and joins a group of pro-confederate guerrillas never in one place for too long , and never left alone . when the group attempt to surrender to the forces , they are gunned down in cold blood by the same group who killed Wales ' family . Josey begins to live the life of an outlaw , constantly on the run from the troops and bounty hunters who are after him . for a man who wishes to be in solitude , he meets many different people and befriends them in a distant kind of way . by the end of the movie , Josey has formed his own band of outlaws and they will stop at nothing to protect themselves and the right they have to live . in the late seventies when people said that the western genre was over , Eastwood shut these critics up by bringing one of the most iconic westerns ever . pretty much like he did nearly twenty years after with the classic ' unforgiven ' which does borrow heavily from this film . Eastwood directs himself with ease , and probably gives the best performance of his career . the story is magnificently adapted from the novel , and the narrative is great . some of the editing leaves a lot to be desired , but it only happens a few times . camera-work is good and it gives the film a gritty feel . clearly one of Eastwoods finest moments , as he even says that it is his favourite own films . a very tense , sad movie , which can change the way people view the ' traditional westerns ' featuring John Wayne and Gary Cooper , as these westerns portray law and order to be the good guys , while ' outlaw ' portrays them to be no good , raping , murderers . was this Eastwoods intention to turn the western genre ? it certainly stands out among the other of the decade .
no school like the old school . . . .	Bob Parr used to be Mr . Incredible , one of the greatest and strongest Supers ; now , he lives a mundane life as a suburban insurance agent . Although his wife Helen has moved on and is more concerned with raising their children Dashiell , Violet , and baby Jack-Jack than battling evil , Bob still yearns for the good old days - and his chance comes when he is approached by a shadowy government organisation and asked to join their numbers . But all is not as it seems , and Bob will find himself trapped by Syndrome , an embittered enemy who in his youth once idolised Mr . Incredible - and only his family will be able to save him now . . . this is probably Pixars greatest creation yet , a more adult orientated family film , which captures the look and the feel of Connery's early outings as Bond . but thats not all you will find in this movie . Bird has obviously taken his experience from the Simpsons and added a little of their magic to the Parr family , with dazzling results . this family may have superpowers , but they all experience the everyday troubles that ' normal ' people go through everyday . losing jobs , feeling shy , having to do the same mundane thing everyday in and out . most people on this planet do this , so does that qualify us as being incredible ? the voice casting is great and suit the roles . Nelson , Hunter , Jackson and Lee all shine in their respected roles , and add a little depth to their characters . the animation has to be some of the best that Pixar have done , and they have really gone to town with this , every little detail has been painstakingly done in this , from the wet look hair , all the way to the magnification on Ednas spectacles . heaven knows how much this movie would have cost if it had been a live action movie , this is why it is suited best to this medium . the score is suitably Bond like , especially when we are in Syndromes secret hideout . a great experience to sit through , whether be it in the cine , a or at home in front of your TV this will not disappoint . it almost harks back to the great adventure films of the mid-eighties ( think Ghostbusters , Gremlins , the Goonies , and The Temple of Doom and your nearly at The Incredibles ) . as i have stated before , this film is aimed at all the family , without silly innuendo for the grown ups , this finally has a sub-plot that we can all appreciate , trying to keep a family together . one of the greatest family films ever made .
we walked for six hours , she never spoke a word to me . . .	Ireland , 1920 . Damien and Teddy are brothers . But while the latter is already the leader of a guerrilla squad fighting for the independence of his motherland , Damien , a medical student at University College , would rather finish his training at the London hospital where he has found a place . However , shortly before his departure , he happens to witness atrocities committed by the ferocious Black and Tans and finally decides to join the resistance group led by Teddy . The two brothers fight side by side until a truce is signed . Bur peace is short-lived and when England imposes a treaty regarded unfair by a part of the population war resumes , this time pitting Irishmen against Irishmen , brothers against brothers , Teddy against Damien . . . a very political movie , which opinion will be divided , but no one can doubt the pain and struggle that the Irish faced against the Black and Tan at this time . what they did was for their country , their freedom , and their dignity . they have no joy in killing their own ( see the scene where Damien has to execute a young boy ) . a very powerful movie by Loach , who pulls no punches with his stark imagery and direction . Murphy is fantastic , in probably his finest role to date . if you are English , you may feel a little guilty about how our ancestors treated the Irish . as i said , a very topical and important movie , with a bitter sting at the end of the tale . recommended
i you wanna buzz , buy a beehive . . . .	This is the story of rival " Firms " of football supporters , and how one man has a wish to team them up for the European Championships of 1988 . However , when this is discussed , the opposing leaders are not happy , as they believe this is a challenge to their authority . This Film shows how football violence has progressed from pure violence to a form of organised crime , to the extent that all the leaders know each others home phone / mobile phone numbers . with an extremely disturbing performance by Gary Oldman , who makes the football Hooligan look like an everyday man ( in which some respects he is ) , Oldman commands the screen and really looks the part as Bex . funny in places and very disturbing to watch , it makes the viewer wonder just how much of this is an actual reality , and how much is exaggerated . watching it almost twenty years after its initial screening , it hasn't lost any of its charm or shock value , and watching the actors on screen , is like a who's who of British TV . the end monologue just shows that these people didn't really care about each other , just about their ' firms ' pride and their . the script sizzles and at just over 60 minutes long , it's over just as quick as it begun . makes films like the football factory , I . D , and green street look tame .
at midnight , i'll turn into a pumpkin and drive away in my glass slipper	Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn have impeccable chemistry in this classic of the golden age of cinema . Ann has clearly had enough with her life as royalty . She rebels against her peers after she has been given a sedative , but before it has a chance to work , she escapes from her room , to see how ' the other half live ' . After losing at a game of cards , Joe is walking the streets of Rome in the early hours of the morning . He stumbles across Ann , mistaking her for being drunk . Unsuccessfully trying to get her home , she spends the night at his apartment , after reciting poetry to him and declaring that she is ' so very happy ' . Late for work , Joe discovers that he has been hiding the missing royal , and plans to release an exclusive interview with her , candid photos et al . taking her on an expedition through beautiful Rome , he finds in Ann a woman of beauty who has lived a sheltered life , a little schoolgirl ( as she claims she is ) who has yet to experience the real world . predictably , they fall for each other and learn a few lessons about their professions and personal lives . with outstanding cinematography and narrative , this is a picture that only directors of this generation could dream of making . with subtle references to Cinderella ( Ann losing her shoe in the opening scene and lines that reference the story ) , Hepburn plays the anti - Cinderella , the rich girl living a normal persons life . going to the ball and instead of having to leave , being forced to leave . homaged in Notting Hill , this is the type of film to watch while experiencing love , and one to watch when trying to romance your loved one . perfect .
Nicky , you were great . . . .	A blonde actress is preparing for her biggest role yet , but when she finds herself falling for her co-star , she reallies that her life is beginning to mimic the fictional film that they're shooting . Adding to her confusion is the revelation that the current film is a remake of a doomed Polish production , 47 , which was never finished due to an unspeakable tragedy . . . another masterpiece from Lynch , which like most of his movies , is very easy to understand in your head , but is unspeakably difficult to try and explain orally . i'm not even going to try to explain my perceptions of the film , but it just blew me away . Laura Dern's performance ( s ) was fantastic and probably her best to date , and the film is typically Lynchian . what he gives us is an experimental nightmare of a movie , it can be argued that the film could ( and i mean could ) be about reflecting on ones life , the Hollywood system and how it exploits people in the industry , schizophrenia , adultery , and even time-travel . but i believe that the movie doesn't start ' proper ' until Nicky finds out that she has go the part , and the time prior to this could be a summary of what will happen to her . as said by the old woman , ' every action has a consequence ' , and in my opinion , Lynch implies that we are like spiders , we weave our own web and we have to live in it . the imagery is vivid , scary yet calming , and sometimes the film is very sexually charged . it's probably Lynch's most complicated film , but very rewarding once watched over and over . watch this and Mulholland drive , it is rewarding .
the best superhero film ever . . . .	wow . . . getting ready for the bryan singer update so had to watch the reeves original . this movie is so cool and shames every other comic book adaption ever committed to celluloid . OK the second act does sag a little , but the the final thirty minutes just makes up for it . i have never sat through such an adrenalin pumping finale . the battle between superman and zod in new york hasn't aged well but it has obviously inspired movies such as blade and the matrix reloaded , would there have been a burley brawl without this picture . it also keeps it's tongue firmly in cheek where other films would lose their bottle and keep things serious . in the final battle in new york , mario puzo keeps the humor to a maximum with little vox pops from the crowd watching , which makes all the difference to the viewing experience , as it becomes more exciting . plus the best superheo soundtrack and the best on screen villain ever with terrence stamps zod . . . no other villain has got the president to kneel before them . would hans gruber have existed if it wasn't for zod ? ? ? the lines are cheesy but they work really well , my personal favorite is " let him go ! , or we'll tear her apart ! ! " all in all a great film to less than perfect franchise with a great feel good ending " funny , i've never seen garbage eat garbage before ! ! " cannot wait to see donners version and heed the warning singer , you have a lot to do to beat this superman ! !
i'm the bad guy ?	William foster is a man who has had a lot of bad luck in recent years . he has lost his job , but is too proud to admit this to family , so spends the day wandering around aimlessly reflecting on his life . also , he is estranged from his wife , and today is his daughters ' birthday . Martin Prendergrast is on his last day before retirement . he too has been dealt a bad hand by god . he has recently lost his daughter and his wife is suffering from a breakdown . all this is happening on one of the hottest days of the year , now William ' D-Fens ' foster has had enough of life and feels he has something to say . . . Micheal Douglas does know how to pick controversial roles , and at the time this was one hot potatoes in Hollywood . a sort of vigilante for the nineties , d-fens will stop at nothing to get to his daughters birthday and the scum of the earth will all try to stop his progress . after such a high profile job is lost , d-fens feels that he has to prove himself of his importance so his character can be quite racist and homophobic at times , and in the same instance , you want to cheer for the man as he is standing up for consumer rights and the right of the ' middle man'this is a very un p . c movie due to the different cultures and creeds he runs into . the shop owner : irks d-fens by selling a can of soda too pricey and not speaking proper Englishthe gay Nazi : irks d-fens for being totally offencive and inhumanthis film must have been inspired by the Rodney king riots of 1992 and you can feel the tension build up to the explosive climax , and you start to feel the same way that d-fens must be feeling in the heat . Douglas is at career best form here and has never surpassed this triumph Duvall plays his role Cooley . but when he snaps , it really hits home . Schumacher proves that he was once a force to be reckoned with in Hollywood and makes the film flow very very smoothly and the editing is second to none . the film can sometimes fall into the western genre at times . like the man with no name , d - fens wanders anonymously from set piece to set piece laying down the law , like a lone gunman , before the climatic gun duel between the two leads at the end . this movie has aged very well and will be a film that will be remembered for some powerful roles a great anti hero and some never bettered roles . see it now .
Uncle Bob ? . . . .	a cyborg was sent from the future to kill Sarah Connor , but he failed . Now a much more powerful one sent from the future to kill Sarah's son - John Connor , the leader of the future rebels . A terminator was send from the future once more , but this time to protect Connor . The only problem is that the terminator who was send to kill Connor is much more powerful and clever than the one who was send to protect him . Moreover , none can help Connor , since they do not believe in robots . Now Connor and his protector has no choice but to survive on their own . . . in 1991 , i remember a reviewer stating that ' you could watch the first 30 mins , leave and come back for the last 30 mins , and you wouldn't have missed anything ' . obviously this person does not know Camerons work , as this isn't just an amazing sequel that outdoes it's predecessor , it's also a thoughtful insight in to the nuclear family and how building relationships from scratch can be as hard as stopping Skynet . as usual Arnie is fantastic as the Cyborg , and in my opinion , this is the best performance he has ever put to screen . Hamilton and Furlong are both amazing in their respective roles , and all three of them form a bond , which will last forever . the film hasn't aged in it's seventeen years and the effects and set pieces are as stunning and vibrant as much as any blockbuster has today . this was made in 1991 , and it still out effects most movies out there . from the stunning truck chase in the water tunnel , to the finale in the steel mill , the film never lets up the tension and the mission . of course with Arnie being the good guy this time , he does get a few good one liners in throughout , but his doesn't spoil the atmosphere of the film , which often references the original . Cameron has constructed an amazing movie , and this is one of the best movies of the nineties . essential for any Schwarzennegar fan .
my way , or the highway . . . . .	Six criminals , who are strangers to each other , are hired by a crime boss Joe Cabot to carry out a diamond robbery . Right at the outset , they are given false names with an intention that they won't get too close and concentrate on the job instead . They are completely sure that the robbery is going to be a success . But when the police show up right at the time and the site of the robbery , panic spreads amongst the group members and one of them is killed in the subsequent shootout along with a few policemen and civilians . When the remaining people assemble at the premeditated rendezvous point ( a warehouse ) , they begin to suspect that one of them is an undercover cop . . . what a directorial debut ! ! all the controversy surrounding this film ( especially in the UK ) in my opinion is drivel , as the film is a skilled , character driven study of a paranoid group of men who have no trust . all involved are excellent and the film is endlessly quotable . the warehouse scenes are the best and the interactions of the characters with there body language and the dialogue is simply perfect . the narrative is accessible , and it's surprisingly endearing when you meet the characters separately through the film , as you actually show empathy for the characters ( even Mr . Blonde ) . this is one of those movies that will stand the test of time , as it is highly original , with a beautiful soundtrack and some career best performances from most of the key cast . editing is slick , and keeps the movie tight throughout . an absolute must .
bloody hell fire . . . . . .	really taking the sixties working class regime and immortalising it on screen , Loach has made one of the best dramas about working class folk that there is . Casper is a bit of a loner as the hero of the picture , and makes a bond with the titular bird , and in turns a corner for him in his stage of life . if it wasn't for the Kestrel , then Billy may have not distanced himself from his former friends and may have rebelled against his mother and followed his brothers footsteps later on in his life . instead with Kes , he is able to block out what is the reality of his life and situation , and go away into a fantasy worlds when he is with his Kestrel . the cinematography here is outstanding , and shows England for what it was for the working class family back then , hard to swallow , with just a few laughs throughout . the film is extremely funny in places , for instance , Glovers PE teacher and his football match is hilarious to watch . also the film is tragic as the ending of the film shows us that Casper has gone back to his reality , knowing that he faces a downward spiral that will lead to just another wasted youth . his Kestrel is a form of communication at times , he is able to reach out to people with Kes , people who wouldn't really bother with him otherwise , knowing that Casper has other interests makes other friends and his Brother Jealous , knowing that Billy can find something different to them in this life . faithfully restoring the book , Loach has made a fantastic , if dingy looking drama with great performances from all those involved .
a pigeon for a pigeon . . .	The Waterfront Crime Commission is about to hold public hearings on union crime and underworld infiltration . As workers are turned against each other , Terry Malloy inadvertently participates in the murder of fellow longshoreman Joey Doyle . Union boss Johnny Friendly orchestrates the murder along with other illegal dockside activities , aided by Terry's brother Charley . Terry begins to feel pangs of conscience . When Joey's sister Edie sees more in Terry than he sees in himself and Father Barry urges him on , Terry reassesses his past and begins to regain responsibility for his actions . . . . throughout the film we see a lot of symbolism . two of the main symbols we see are prominent throughout the movie . the first one is Terry's jacket . when the movie begins , we see him in a checkered jacket , indicating that he doesn't know what side he is on . the second instance with the jacket is when we see Terry in his suit jacket . when he is being escorted to his apartment by the police , we see a little tear under the left shoulder , indicating that maybe he has ruined his life in doing what he had just done . the symbol with the jacket is in the final scene , this time wearing a full block coloured jacket , indicating he knows what side he is one . the second symbol is to do with the pigeons . the pigeons are represented as the dockworkers , scared of the hawks ( Friendly and company ) and holed up in a cage ad they have no where else to go and no one else to turn to . when terry finds the pigeons dead , this could indicate that his fellow work mates have turned their back on him for doing the right thing . the beginning of the film includes a situation with a pigeon . the performances are fantastic for this production and Brando deserves all the acclaim he received for this performance , and he never bettered himself . during the ' i coulda been a contender ' speech , it brings a tear to the eye because his role is so convincing , you can feel Terrys pain when the self realisation of knowing he has ruined his life sets in . the final dock scene is one of the most satisfying scenes ever committed to celluloid , showing that Terry has won the war , this is shown on screen by the shutters closing down to Friendly when he is alone and at his lowest ebb . with fantastic cinematography and narration , the film is very downbeat and dark , it could almost be considered to be film noir . a classic in every sense .
any requests for your final flight ?	while off road biking in Hawaii , Sean Jones witnesses the execution of a top lawyer by mobster Eddie Kimm . when Kimm finds out about this , he orders the death of Sean at any cost . trying to escape Kimms henchmen from his own apartment , Sean is saved by F . B . I agent Neville Flynn , who promises Sean that if he testifies against Kimm , he will be safe . if he doesn't Kimm will stop at nothing to kill him . Sean agrees to do this , as this means that Kimm will be locked up for a long time . a flight is arranged for them to get back to L . A , and this is tracked down by Kimm . Kimms henchman plant dozens and dozens of deadly snakes on the plane and spray a pheromone that makes the snakes aggressive . the flight and the passengers are in mortal danger as the snakes are released 30 , 000 feet in the air . . . . first of all , all i can say is believe the hype . . . . and then some . this film is so entertaining and so enjoyable that words do not even begin to state how much i ( and from the cheering and the clapping the rest of the audience ) enjoyed this movie . if there ever was a film that dripped high concept , this is it . but it's not all about snakes on a plane . it's about peoples fears and learning to cope with them and also about feeling helpless at a time of need . Kimm does not expect the snakes to kill Sean , what he expects is the plane to crash and reported as a tragic accident . with the past five years news stories , this has terrorism high on the ' read between the lines ' stuff . the flight contains real heroes and real dirt-bags . every clichéd stereotype is thrown in for good measure . the newlyweds . the horny couple . the pretentious star . the baby and mother . the two boys flying alone for the first time . the stewardess flying for the last time . the camp steward . the upper class business man . the dog . and of course the F . B . I agent and his witness . throw all these into a plane full of aggressive snakes and you have the finest set piece seen this year . when them snakes attack , you will be lifting your feet in the air and flinching . the story is great and the narrative flows like a river and there are some fine ( if camp ) performances . Jackson puts his all into this and is clearly having a great time . my only quibble is that you can tell where they have added extra scenes into the film , eg for profanity nudity and extra violence . but don't let that deter you from seeing this . any body could write any thing about this film , praise it or really criticise it , but at the end of the day , with a film called snakes on a plane , you're either going to see it , or your not . from all the hype that this has gained from the internet , and the fan-boys ( and girls ) calling for added violence , this film will go down in hissssss-tory . one of the most fun movies of the year , you sit back , and don't take anything seriously for the following 95 minutes , and you will have a ball .
sorrow	i was so sorry to see this film endif any body wants to be a teacher then watch this movie . it is one of the most inspiring movies i have ever seen . the teacher was so empathic towards his students and the children were some of the most adorable ever to grace the screen . the ending of the documentary bought a tear to my eye . the pain the teacher has in is body is so evident that you just have to sympathise with him . the connection he has with these children are just phenomenaland i'm sure jojo was just there for comedy value ! ! words cannot express just how tremendous this film is . watch it and i dare you not to cry
happy trails	in 1988 Joel silver was unbeatable in the action genre . with this and lethal weapon he had the majority of the market . now look at him . useless . but Bruce Willis made this film his own . the first real action star who seemed vulnerable and who did genuinely get hurt . thats what makes this film one of the best of the genre . all the support are fantastic too . with praise going to Reggie veljohnson the buddy who mclane never meets until the end but gives him a knowing look , William atherton who shows that his character Walter peck in ghost busters can be expanded to good measure . but above all else the real star of the show is Alan rickman the uber villain . no one can do evil now like rickman and come even close to being sinister . his performance was so good , i cannot see him in a movie without thinking of Hans gruber ( imagine watching love actually ! ! ) that's good acting for you and he has never been better ( robin hood was his last high point ) . people love this film because john is an everyday man who has everyday problems so people sympathise for him a lot more than if he was a musclebound force ( imagine Schwarzenegger in this role , or anyone ? ) and to complete the perfection of the movie it's set at Christmas one of the most emotional times of the year . i guess john was thinking ' how am i gonna save the day , get my wife back , and get my kids to love me ' great sound track too , gets your adrenaline pumping every time you watch it . a claustrophobic , taut , genre defining action movie that will stand the test of time and make Willis the legend he deserves to be .
