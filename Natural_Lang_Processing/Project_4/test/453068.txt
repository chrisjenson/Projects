Sometimes a little disorienting , but also compelling	This is not the most original idea ever . On an episode of Seinfeld , there was an episode where the story was told backwards and the reasons for one scene were explained in the next ( George feels sick in one scene , then we see in the next scene that right before that it was Clams Casino ) . So , I have a feeling writers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan and Director Chris knew what they were getting into . Still , it is as original idea I've seen for a movie since Being John Malkovich . Guy Pearce plays Leonard , a guy who saw his wife killed and then was struck with short term memory loss ( he explains everything fades ) , but then goes on a journey to find who the killer is . The story is told backwards though , so it is interesting to see who the killer is at the beginning ( and be killed ) , and then the events leading up to it . At times , particularly at the end , the film gets a little disconcerting , but it is also a well told story , with a fine lead in Pearce .
might be the worst zombie movie I've seen in a very long time , and I've seen Zombi 3	I'm reminded while watching Death Valley : The Revenge of Bloody Bill on the sci-fi channel something George A . Romero said recently about certain new horror directors : " They shot Faith Hill's last music video , and they think they're hot s . Do they know how to handle it ? No , they don't . Put ' em at an editing table , and they're clueless . " Although Byrum Werner ( maybe the coolest name for an exploitation director , I'll admit ) probably hasn't done a Faith Hill video , the comparison can still apply . Werner shouldn't be directing anything remotely related to celluloid , from seeing the catastrophe that is ' Bloody Bill ' , as he tries to compensate for a rote and crappy script with much worse ' style ' . Maybe it's a personal thing , but it's a pet peeve for me when a director uses a specific tint for a purpose that is completely ancillary , where it's more about calling attention to itself than serving any meaningful stylistic choice ( Spielberg may be the only one who can get away with it ) . In this case , Werner uses it to the point of total madness , and not good madness : the tint is actually a lot of the time just on the top part of the frame , making it a foolish distraction . This goes without saying that the whole color scheme in general , whether applied by Werner himself as DP or in post , is annoying because it makes it obvious that he doesn't trust anything regarding the actual space being used , or maybe using some natural light or shadows to make atmosphere , instead of splashing on this crude red - often in a blurred vision ( FOCUS ! I screamed more than once ) . Don't even get me started on the editing in many instances , where random montage and action is cut as if by an epileptic puppy . The story itself is rote anyway : a bunch of teens riding out in the desert get car-jacked ( ! ? ) by a black guy who leads them to the ghost town of Sunset Valley , overrun by ( usually ) running zombies led by Bloody Bill , who has a vendetta against someone done wrong by someone and blah blah blah . Point is , a lot of this , however just totally ludicrous it all sounds ( Bloody Bill's a confederate - no Yankees or blacks after all ) , could just be moot if it was at least a halfway decently acted or technically executed effort . It's not , at all . Watching Death Valley is like getting a checklist for things that could possibly go wrong for a movie and do , over and over again . The music is fourth-rate metal garbage on loan from the boys who've been practicing in the garage next-door ; the " performances " are from nobodys ( Gregory Bastian goes to lengths to be a bad-ass mutha , but is one of the most ineffectual I've seen in recent memory ) , this including Bloody Bill's ' actor ' who is barely on screen at all ; the gore and violence is directed amateurishly , with tomato-sauce blood and eye-liner used for added " effect " during the transformation from living to dead ; even the production design , with the sign changing from time to time from 99 to 107 from start to finish is cheesy in an unforgivable way . It works only up to a completely ironic point ; make sure you've got the right friends and good booze lying around and it should make for a chummy Saturday night movie . But good lord , don't go into it expecting any semblance of an entertaining B-horror movie . It's drek of the shlockiest order , and I'd have to be paid more than the actors themselves were ( if they were that is ) to sit through it again .
some may love it , and some just wont . . . I definitely didn't	Sometimes a cult film just can't be made when it's just made by " whimsy " or whatever to be so . Sometimes it works , like with Snakes on a Plane , but then other times we get a film that ends up dividing the audience so thickly that you can feel tension in the air during a screening . Luckily I watched Repo ! The Genetic Opera at home on DVD , so me and my wife had and took every chance to bemoan , groan , yell-at-the-screen and curse it to high heavens - I may have even thrown something like headphones at the TV - and didn't have to worry about other meddlesome audience members getting in the way . Because this was , to me at least , not something much enjoyable or memorable as a cult film . It's not a complete failure , but something pretty much close to being , and it is not something I would ever want to watch again ( how I got through it I can't quite explain here . . . maybe blackouts ? ) The filmmaker is Darren Lynn Bousman , responsible for a huge chunk of the Saw franchise , and here he continues his legacy of film-making that is pretty sickening to watch . He has some competent skills , like say knowing how to make BLAZING lights all over the place , or giving it the " blue-tint " look . So he tries , Lord he tries , and if that's your game well then have at it . But it's not much different in quality than the Saw movies except with . . . a song . Or a bunch of them . Actually , that's a lie ; as an opera , this is a case of people " trying " to sing - and good , accomplished singers like Anthony Stewart Head ( who proved he could sing wonderfully on Buffy the Vampire Slayer ) and Paul Sorvino ( a TRAINED opera singer ) tossed in with , well , Paris Hilton ( best thing I can say . . . her boobs grew ? ) , and there are no real melodies , and if there are they have that grungy awfulness that makes Hot Topic look as bad as it probably is when it comes to these pre-manufactured pieces of industrial rock-dung . But , one should take my words with some measure of salt . At best , the music just isn't for me , and if others like some of the songs ( or when they are songs ) I can respect that . What I can't respect is film-making that ignores competent storytelling for a lot of nonsensical singing - when - should - be - talking . Since the title proclaims it to be an opera then that should be an indicator of how the style will reflect this description . Trouble is , there's nothing there worthwhile in the opera category . Some of it is laughable , some of it completely unbearable , all around some hackneyed story that could have some level of simplistic pleasure ( as far as these stories go , which by the way Saw fans , Bousman does his Saw 3 trick here of flashbacks as a means of making up for actually , you know , progressing the story meaningfully ) . And as someone who can dig pointless and excessive violence when done right here it's just done wrong , totally hackneyed there as well . . . another word for hackneyed ? Just . . . blah ? So , I guess , watch the trailer first . Maybe make a somewhat educated guess as to where to go . If loud and monotonous rock anthems that make Rocky Horror look like a cinematic marvel ( which is more deservedly so if it is compared to this ) topped with blue-tint cinematography and crappy CGI and songs that go nowhere , then here's the ticket . But just in case here's a few other things sort of in this vein you could ( or should ) watch instead : Buffy's episode " Once More , with Feeling " where we see just how much better Head is comparatively ( and , frankly , I blame this more on the creative team behind Repo than any lack in Head's skills ) , The Saddest Music in the World ( which also tries for this crazy cinematic exercise in cult-in-the-making movie-making with music and works far better ) , and . . . and I can't believe I'm writing these words : Paint Your Wagon . Period .
probably one of my least favorite films from 2005 ; not memorable at all	You might think with a cast as large as this , with a mix of big-name actors ( Travolta , Thurman , Keitel , Vaughn ) , music people and other pop culture people ( Andre Benjamin , The Rock , Cedric the Entertainer ) , that it might just be worth watching for them if not funny from the material . But it's not either much funny or really memorable for its cast . When presented with such a group of talent such as this , you know you'll either get something special or something of a downer , and its unfortunate that the latter applies . This is based on an Elmore Leonard book , but it didn't seem as if F . Gary Gray payed attention to getting the right rhythm in the comedy , or just getting the right people for the characters , as Barry Sonnenfeld did with his 1995 film Get Shorty . This time , basically , Chili Palmer ( Travolta ) is in the music industry instead of movies , and he gets involved with a woman ( Thurman sexy in her first scene , though not bringing much else throughout the film ) , and also through wanting to get an R & B singer ( Christina Milan ) to the attentions of producers . But , of course , there are problems on the crime end of the spectrum , involving Keitel and Vaughn , and the Rock . Unfortunately , I can't really tell you much else I can recall from Be Cool , as the story itself isn't much of interest . A couple of individual jokes and lines here and there might muster up a laugh or a grin , but nothing amounts to much , and the filmmaker doesn't seem capable of balancing the varying styles that the actors might be able to bring along with the cooky , deterring story . It's a movie also more concerned with its supporting characters than its lead ( s ) . And one might start to feel a little bit of grimace as Travolta and Thurman once again shake it up on the dance floor , but with something missing from their first outing over a decade ago . Be Cool isn't an unpleasant experience , but it borders on it , as the comedy often hits flatter than expected , and even an actor like Keitel , who I would see in just about anything , can't bring anything to his part . You know there's something a little off when the Rock provides more laughs than anyone else in the picture .
so , Sean Connery didn't understand the Matrix , but this movie . . .	Zardoz is , quite frankly , one of the all-time champion ' train-wreck ' type films I've seen from the 70's , or for that matter any decade . Which means , in short , it's the kind of unbridled cinematic mess that only someone coming right off of the success of Deliverance would even dare of doing . Part of me was thinking while watching this film " what is this director thinking , or trying to even pass off as connecting with the themes ? NONE of this makes sense ! " Then even when I grasped the basic gist of the plot ( if there even is one ) of Connery playing some rogue killer who gets trapped into a ' vortex ' where everyone lives and doesn't die but can get old and can't have sex and blah blah , I and the friends watching this with me kept muttering " oh my God " . In a way it is actually watchable in that very campy , bad-movie sense . There are few bad movies , with the exceptions of Plan 9 and Manos , that contain so many laughs in just the first twenty minutes or so ( unintentionally of course , as it's all played very seriously and self-importantly ) . I mean , even before the opening credits roll we get a ) a giant floating mask-head , b ) random lines referring to the powers of guns and dangers of male genitals , and c ) Connery just shooting at the screen . It only gets better ( or worse depending on your point of view ) from there . Also co-starring is Charlotte Rampling ( and boy has she had better days ) as one of the members of the ' vortex ' who ends up becoming rather close with the main beast-of-burden , so to speak ( and yes , it's rather stupefyingly amazing that his name is ' Zed ' ) . Zardoz is one of those very pure , and of course then intrinsically doomed , cult-of-the-moment pictures , where a filmmaker given carte Blanche by a studio pours out something that is so personal , so strange , and so corrupted by self-indulgence , it's either big hit or dangerous miss . While I would consider this film to be apart of the latter , I didn't necessarily have a bad time watching the film . I knew what I was getting into , for example , just by the theatrical trailer . It's got some of that of-the-times psychedelia working in there , and sequences that utilize slow-motion , instant replay , Zed inside a big , uh , crystal thing , and other outrageous feats of sci-fi cinema . Those who might rate it rather high are likely bigger buffs than I , or maybe can take not only the story seriously but take the style with a grain of salt . But in looking at this today , and especially at a leading man who is looking way too much like Burt Reynolds for comfort , this is one of the more frustrating , deranged , and ironically hilarious films of its time , a kind of ambitious peak into ' what-the-f " film-making that you rarely get anymore .
this maybe could be a little more tolerable as a half hour Twilight Zone episode . . . wait , without commercials , 23 minutes !	That is one of the goofy comparisons you might make , as I did , when this goofy psychological thriller ended . Because despite what might have been director Joel Schumacher and DP Matthew Libatique's loftier intentions with the grit and ' mainstream-noir ' , the writing ends up cramping up everything that might have been worthwhile . There is a premise here , just not one that goes down very fast in anything that seems sharp or with a real edginess that I could have latched onto . Fernelly Phillips , on his first feature as a screenwriter , comes out with many ideas and gimmicks and , to be sure , contrivances that reminded me of the gimmicks I saw from the lesser screenwriters at my film school - it's almost like pulling together some kind of general theme and extending it to see if something really sticks about obsession and the symbolism of numbers , or a number in this case as the be-all-end-all of meaningful numbers . Maybe if he had focused his energies on more of the noirish aspects of the characters , as opposed to flaunting the number 23 , I wouldn't still be making jokes about numbers adding or equally somehow to 23 , and almost hating myself for making those jokes at the movie's expense . Maybe it was to be expected that Schumacher , who hasn't really made a very satisfying film since the mid 90s , would gravitate to material like this that would at least allow him some time to exercise his ' weird ' directorial chops . And really , there is some potential in this as well ; Carrey's dog-catcher protagonist is given a book on his birthday ( which is on , ho-ho ) called the Number 23 , which deals with a sax-playing detective with a dark past who gets involved with an even darker , more sadistic woman ( Virginia Madsen , who also plays the ' real-world ' wife of Carrey's character , as he envisions it as he reads it anyway ) , and the sadism and murder and madness that ensues . If there was just a straight adaptation of the book AS the movie , or if the archetypal figures that lay in this pulpy world inspired in part by serial novels were just put forward simply without the number symbolism , it would be a much more intriguing movie . Especially because said ' imagined ' scenes showing what happens in the book are shot in a perfectly abstract style , where even in the choppy edit parts there's still a vicious vision going on . These sparks indicate that there COULD be some talent in writer and filmmaker . As for Carrey , he seems to be just going through his motions for what he can do as an actor ( as with Madsen , up to a point ) , but it's not enough to stop what happens with the script , which at times seems to be going at lengths to continue that montage in Pee Wee's Big Adventure when Pee-Wee sees all the bikes going by when his is gone . Soon Carrey's " every-man " sees it everywhere , with numbers adding up , the combinations endless , and it all leading to what ends up being so predictable I wouldn't dare spoil it not because it's very important but just to not insult your intelligence reading this . Just let it be known that Phillips decides to take that easy-route of the main character really having to face head-on everything that he's encountered so far and then re-contemplate everything in his entire life . This , which makes up the last fifteen minutes , is excruciating in the length of the exposition , with all the answers spoon-fed to the audience so that nothing is left questioned about who this man really is or what he's done . It compounds what has already gone on with the pretentious obsessive qualities , of it being about the ' trick ' instead of it being more interesting about characters ( the very last scene also made me shake my head and do all but throw popcorn at the screen ) . Bottom line , it's a pretty stupid entry in the careers of both actor and director , which also happens to include a supporting character of a dog named Ned ( who provides a very unintentionally funny scene with the dog on one end of the road and Carrey in his car at the other ) , Bud Cort in the thankless role , and lots of big-budget attention paid to the grungy details of what is under a happy existence to reveal the wretched skeletons in the closet ( or rather under a stone in a park ) . It's too conventional , in all actuality , to follow up on the daring it portends in the already pushy trailer and ads .
definitely not a good movie , but could it have been better ? maybe	Willard Huyuck , and collaborator / wife Gloria Katz , never got a career going like buddy George Lucas . As a writer they got to pen some of his works ( American Graffiti and Temple of Doom , even allegedly some uncredited work on the first Star Wars ) , but on their own turned out mostly either bad work , like here , or fun bad work like Howard the Duck . Messiah of Evil , as was titled when I watched it , is a muddled picture about a woman who comes to her artist father's seaside home , only to find he's not around but has left a lot of notes about the horrors that have come unto the area , and soon enough there's dead people coming out at night to claim those around the area . It's muddled , for one thing , because the way the dialog is presented , sometimes in narration and sometimes just badly recorded , comes off like its meant to be amateurish ( or , at best , right out of a MST3K movie ) , not to mention in the bulk of the performances ( albeit character actor Elisha Cooke Jr pops up for a couple of scenes as a town nut ) . And yet , even with the overall flaws of the film , plus the silly concept of a blood-red moon and all that nonsense with the design of the house , there are some notes that hint at a better movie . Shots like the one looking down that white corridor with the figure at the end , or the one girl wandering through the empty streets with a red tint , or the big horror scenes at the supermarket or an even creepier scene at the movie theater . These are interesting bits that show some artistic promise on the part of Huyuck and Katz . Unfortunately , as it would seem , these bits don't add up to anything substantial for either a guilty pleasure or as something so trashy that it would work as some bizarre cult film . It's probably forgettable by most film-goers for a reason ( or , for that matter , why it was found by me on a double-feature Alpha video DVD with Sisters of Death ) . Not the worst , but not good , it's 70's knock-off drek .
has its moments , but by far the least memorable of the films so far	Maybe it was keeping on Chris Columbus as director - he helmed the first Harry Potter and did an OK , if not that terrific , job at it - or in making it about as long as possible ( whether or not everything in the book , as someone who's seen the films but not read the books , I can't say , though it feels like they crammed it all ) , or in making it a wee bit too corny , but Chamber of Secrets is a bulky kids movie . It has an appeal for the whole family , as does the first one , and it has some charm and excitement in its Quiddich battle scenes , but it isn't really always the sort of material that might stay with you long after it's over ( unless , of course , you're a hardcore fan ) . It works at best in the form of the atypical sequel : same characters that like Potter just as much - his closest friends Ron and Hermonie - and those that don't like Snape and Malfoy . Although the film / story does set up " he-who-mus-not-be-named " in a good and ambiguous way , this is more in hindsight of the more recent Potter stories , where that is made much more clear and sinister . It does have some rousing bits in there , as I recall , John Cleese is particularly good as Nearly Headless Nick ( basically plopping a Monty Python performer in the midst of it all , which is the case ) and there's always Richard Harris as Dumbledore ( I still prefer him over Gambon , even though the latter is still good ) . But a lot of it seems much too cliché , even coming from the decent lot of Rowling subversions , and the whole bits with the character Dobby is just really cheesy . In short , it's the only one of the Potter movies I don't have a desire to see too soon , and if I ever do read the books I only anticipate it can only go up from here in quality .
tries , but is too mediocre and ordinary a thriller to get fun bad-movie leverage	I knew going into Next that it probably wouldn't be totally similar to Philp k . Dick's original short story the Golden Man ( matter of fact after checking out the synopsis of the story in comparison with the final product here they're only similar in that they both have characters who can see into the future and may or may not be under the control of the government ) , yet what remains here is an intriguing premise squandered mostly by someone who's more of a by-the-books Hollywood director , Lee Tamahori , who tries too much to make Next a conventional a thriller as possible almost in spite of its awesomely bad-movie tendencies . Nicolas Cage plays the title character , a magician in Vegas named Frank Cadillac ( named after two of his favorite things , Frankenstein and Cadillacs , a rather ludicrous explanation but why not ) , and who just wants to stay under the radar , even as he's fully aware of his own special gift : he can see approximately two minutes into his own future , what is directly around him at the time , and can stop it almost in spite of the fact that merely looking at it changes it in a way . There's two story lines competing for attention here , one is something that was probably on the leftover counter of the 80s action-thriller picture where the US government will stop at nothing to squash dirty Russian terrorists with no real demands except to set off nuclear madness . The other is the romantic sidebar with Cage and Jessica Biel , whom he gets involved with in a strange way in that he's seen her in the future long before other events ; at first she just finds him odd , then when the news is broken to him she has to re-think things , though of course not for long . Unlike other Dick adaptations , this one doesn't take place in the future , however it limits more of the possibilities for the science-fiction subversion for heavily gun-toting , high-flying chase and battle sequences that are just marginally satisfying and usually just this side of , well , bland . What does make it sort of watchable though is Cage , who has that " determined " look on his face , and is only expressive enough as time will allow ( one scene where he does get into some expression is ironic since his eyes are opened wide ala Clockwork Orange to test for the government what he can see ) . Other possibilities from the original text are left out in lieu of decisions in the script and the direction that do , however , carry along many unintentionally entertaining aspect ( or maybe intentional , who knows with the motley crew of writers they've assembled for the screenplay ) . Certain lines are hilarious in just how they can be uttered seriously in a movie ( i . e . Biel and Cage in bed , sleepily she says " Maybe there is such a thing as destiny " ) , or in little twists that Frank makes as he always is one step ahead of what will happen , like in the pick-up scene in the diner , or , more uproariously funny ( at least to me ) , when he splits up into multiple versions of the same character during the climactic cat & mouse game in the bowels of the boat ( yes , multiple versions , as we see him cheat every scenario that he could possibly enter ) . There's even something sudden and exciting about seeing situations , albeit not to be , where the hero fails and the girl dies in a big bang . But even the possibilities here of this being a follow-up in a sense to Cage's previous starring vehicle , Ghost Rider , in making this a guilty pleasure , get squashed because , frankly , Tamahori is satisfied with just staying square enough with little rip-off moments ( intro to Vegas via Ocean's Eleven ) , bland action ( surprising coming from Julianne Moore ) , and a somewhat tepid romance between Biel and Cage . The use of visual effects is also a little deterring . But to say that it's neither a very good movie or a very bad movie is besides the point . Next is an example of run-of-the-mill theatrics with more involving underlying elements , of questions raised about the responsibility of a person with clairvoyance to the public and those closest to him , and the more cheesy bits of braggadocio , not being paid more attention than the usual mainstream aims . A shame , though it might get a few minutes of viewing time by me when it pops up on cable .
undercooked and too short , but there are some exciting moments	A B-movie with maybe a slight notch of extra fatalism , Flight to Fury is Monte Hellman with a near-disposable piece of low-budget work that's somewhat made up for by some stirring action set-pieces and a chase that makes up the best part of the movie in the last ten minutes . Dewey Martin plays Joe , a man with a particular goal he's after , which is never really too specified despite some interesting , shady dealings early on ( according the site here it's gold ) . Jay ( Jack Nicholson ) gets involved almost through a very smooth-operating sociopath scheme , as he kills Joe's one night stand and somehow gets involved in the expedition . On the plane , with some other nefarious characters including a Japanese fellow ( Vic Diaz ) , the plane crashes , leaving a few dead and the rest on a trip to get help . But since they're in the Phillipenes , they get caught . Will they escape ? Hey , it's a B-movie after all . The premise isn't that great , but unfortunately Hellman doesn't get things truly in gear until the 2nd half ( the scenes on the plane are actually really dull , maybe the point but dull nonetheless ) . Once the stakes get raised and the characters get more and more on edge - and casualties and bullets fly - then the fun of Hellman's dread-in-B-movie-land gets going stronger . Luckily he has Nicholson as co-star , who even in a less demanding role here gives the goods , as aside from the ' Japanese ' guy on the crutches there isn't much in the way of even just decent acting ( with the possible exception of that sexual assault scene on Destiny in the hut by the captor ) . And much of the motives and the dialog , also provided by Nicholson , seem underdeveloped and not good enough for just a 73 minute running time . Then again , it's good that material like this doesn't over-stay its welcome . I also will probably want to check out just the last ten minutes some other time , as it makes for a very nifty chase scene , in the empty black & white photography , and has a few memorable shots of Nicholson holding a gun and his limp-shot arm . Not a total waste but nothing special , the kind of little movie that probably played a lot on midday TV back in the 70s .
more of a misstep from the writers & Sheen than Eastwood	I've watched the Rookie on TV recently , and I can see what's wrong with it up front . What took a little longer to see was why it could've been better , or maybe couldn't . To give credit where some minimal credit is due , Clint Eastwood as director - and even as star to a degree - is just doing what he does , and as business as usual with his style and presence it isn't bad at all . In fact , given that he's strapped to a chair for half the film at the whim of not only Raul Julia ( as a German ? ) but also Sonia Braga , I'd say that for die-hard Eastwood fans it should be worthwhile to watch at least once . The disappointment for me , thinking about it more , was Charlie Sheen who may have been miscast as the hot-headed , scarred and typical ' rookie ' David Ackerman . He comes in with the same attitude from Major League , where it worked , but it doesn't here . Despite the character , background and just in general , not being written quite right , there could've been a better actor , one with some more subtlety to compare against Eastwood's usual , cool swagger . Then again , in general , there is something of a very mixed bag about the screenplay by Boaz Yakin and Evil Dead 2 co-writer Scott Spiegel . On the one hand certain lines and a scene or two do click well enough with humor & / or the sort of usual police thriller scenes ( plus a good tongue-in-cheek kind of bar-fire outburst with Sheen ) . On the other hand , it's also got a lot of overwrought dialog delivered by character actors who should be given better . Even as an exploitation film at times the script doesn't suit its director . The Rookie is the kind of dumb Hollywood action show that I wanted to like more than I did , grimacing during the more uncomfortable scenes ( i . e . Braga and Eastwood's " number " on the chair ) , and seeing at best some solid genre mechanics going on . Overall , it's so-so .
For the audience , this is one of the most subjective films made in recent history . . .	. . . and I suppose on that level Mel Gibson's " hottest " movie since Braveheart and the Lethal Weapon days , is a success . Rarely has an audience been so polarized , so backed into a corner by the media's controversy , and by the reactions from audiences around the world ( or rather in America , in other countries the film didn't have as huge an impact , at least box-office wise ) . Some of the best movies bring forth people to discuss them , to debate them , to conjure thought . While The Passion of the Christ does that , its controversies don't end up as one of the best movies of the year for me , far from it . It's like if Pier Paolo Pasolini ( director of Salo , a film that beats this film to the rank of the most disturbing over-the-top " statement " movie ever ) had been given Hollywood money , sat through a few dozen Italian horror films for inspiration beforehand , and decided to re-make his The Gospel According to St . Matthew ( without the ' talky ' points ) . Or , maybe not . Maybe it's just Gibson spewing out everything in his twisted head about what he thinks on Jesus . But one thing it's not is authentic , at least emotionally . Those reading this review and others on this site know what the film's about - like The Passion of Joan of Arc ( one of my favorites and infinitely more compelling and tragic on a tortured soul , despite no money and no sound and minimal violence ) , Gibson takes the last hours of an infamous figure's life , and condenses it into a film . Whatever glimpses we get of Jesus ' teachings and life before his betrayal and torture and death are snipped in as though Gibson wanted Tarantino's story structure from Reservoir Dogs . And like Tarantino , though on another playing field with even more melodrama , at least of the film is devoted to showing Jesus as something of a superhero , able to withstand tumultuous whippings , scourges , crown-o-thorns , and his arduous trip through town to the hilltop without once going unconscious or ( gasp ) killed before the big show . Other images pop up here and there , such as the always weeping Mary Magdalene and Mother Mary , the weird Devil children and lady Satan , and the attitudes ( though , unlike Joan of Arc , no close-ups ) of the angry Jewish priests . As I said , to watch this film for objectivity is not so much as for subjectivity . In the film-making department , Gibson does implement some good things - with Francesco Frigeri and Carlo Gervasis ' set and production design , as well as Caleb Deschanel's cinematography ; the film at times is sweeping in its scope and detail . But on the other hand ( as with the treatment of the Jesus character ) the tone of the film is mostly one note , and loaded with a banging melodrama that keeps the tone of the picture on a track that will get boring for those who aren't with the mood of the film every step of the way . John Debney's music is also as melodramatic as it is chinsy . Then there is Jesus himself , the way he is presented , taken out , and so on , and this where the subjectivity comes in . The problem is , as much as it sounds like it might be fascinating to try , I can't change my beliefs around a film , and no one film will change my mind on how I view a particular religious character ( s ) . Not even The Last Temptation of Christ , a film that made Jesus at least more than a one-sided caricature , could persuade me to go on that route . I'm not saying the film forces a person to accept Jesus as savior and the one and only messiah ( though it's not totally un-true that it will mark higher importance if you're ' deep ' into Christianity ) , but it doesn't give a person much room to question the logic behind the approach to it all . Aside from all the excessive violence and brutality , which I could take and I know others could not , it is thematically a difficult film , and it doesn't leave room for compromise . On one hand the idea behind the story is daring , and on the other hand the execution of it is , in a sense , preaching to the choir . It doesn't help much to the fact that Jim Caviezel , while authentic in the look , is almost catatonic in much of his performance when he's not spouting off at the trial or moaning in his tortured state . At best , Gibson's vision of the final day and night of one of the most infamous figures in recent ( if you look at the history of the world , two thousand years isn't too long of a time ) history , is unique . I doubt anyone else in Hollywood would have the conviction to go through with it . But at worst , it's only of worth to those who are already down with the Lord Jesus Christ , and is the closest thing this year to being a snuff film . If you saw it in the theater or decide to rent it now on rental you'll know what that means . Like a carefully planned and structured train wreck , this is one artist's interpretation that didn't enlighten or inspire or make me think about what it was like to be Jesus ( ' Temptation ' did that ) , but it will for some , and is not entirely forgettable .
Arch Hall Sr's crowning achievement ! wait , it's his only movie as a director !	Although it's tempting to give weird dog of a motion picture , by proxy of Mystery Science Theater 3000 , which may or may not be the only available version right now , it goes all the way to being a classic . They make this very random precursor to Encino Man , with hints of quality that might've inspired Hal Warren , work much better than it would without . WATCH OUT FOR SNAKES ! It's the suspenseful story of a young man and young woman ( well , young man depending on point of view , as Hall Jr himself plays the lead character Tom Nelson , with his wacky pompadour and scrunched face ) who go out to a desert valley , but as Tom sings a song ( with random singing voices playing in the background ) , poor Roxy is taken away to the cave of a caveman where , oddly enough , her father is also waiting . The caveman - dubbed Eegah for his bouts of grunts equaling that word - shows off his wares , which are just corpses all lined up , and as he starts to get more and more attracted to Roxy Tom finally goes on the lookout to find her . WATCH OUT FOR SNAKES ! Meanwhile , she shaves Eegah , she and her father escape , and Eegah goes in pursuit in random long takes where Eegah pursues as the car won't work driving in his direction ! Even more odd than this , somehow after how many hundreds of thousands of years of Eegah's existence , he finds his way to the small town Tom and Roxy are in , and wreaks havoc on everyone in town ( well , not everyone , there's not enough balance for that ) . Not sure if this will give you an idea of what the movie's about , as there isn't much ' about ' it , except that it's young kids who sing , go ' wee ' in a car , and have to have existential tidings with a caveman , including a shaving of his fake beard , and some possible controversy in the town when they return . It's very lame - WATCH OUT FOR SNAKES ! - and doesn't always make much sense , which is good that the MSTK3000 commentary comes in . It turns what it otherwise the purest form of an ultra low-budget not-quite B-movie lark into a really hilarious trip . They keep repeating the phrase that appears seemingly out of nowhere despite it being credited to a line from Hall Sr , " WATCH OUT FOR SNAKES " , this despite the fact that there is only ONE shot of snakes ; we see more footage of lizards having sex and gila monsters crawling around then we do snakes , which adds to incredibly to it being sort of unintentional comic genius ala God complex . You may even want to join in with friends to say it at random times . So , get ready to see some graceful club-waving , lavishly dated pop guitar playing and singing by Hall Jr and Henry Prince ( that pool scene is absolutely golden ) , and jump-cuts that give Godard a run for his innovator money . WATCH OUT FOR SNAKES !
has its moments , but generally is not top-shelf Herzog despite it's ambitions	I actually admire what writer / director Werner Herzog was going for with Even Dwarfs Started Small even if I think he didn't quite execute it in a manner that involved me enough . It's got a great idea behind it - inmates at a mental institution , on one of the Canary Islands pre-tourism , create an anarchic uprising with practically no one else in sight , and the headmaster locks himself in with a retarded patient while the others go wild and crazy , albeit still staying in the confines of the grounds of the area . I also liked when Herzog went for an interesting route in the picture psychologically and in mood , which was to show how chaos and disarray , even if among little people , can actually become rather aimless and uncanny . There is no plot , it's just a series of interconnected segments that seem to be happening in real time , where they do things like ogle at naked girls in magazines , kill a pig randomly , give constant torture to a couple of blind dwarfs , circle around a constantly 360 degree spinning car , and with Herzog sometimes just as interested in the animals ( chickens , a camel , the pig , a monkey ) on the premises as he is with his whacked out little folk . But the problem arises then with the work that since it is plot less - even if it ends with the headmaster , talking to a branch outside , as a metaphor for human control and what is and what isn't a free will or spirit perhaps - there's the danger of becoming tedious with what goes on , and that's exactly the trap that I think Herzog falls into here . It's not that he is out blatantly to mock them ( although , like with Stroszek , the tendency to laugh is hard to avoid at times , especially with its documentary-style anything-goes approach ) , but there isn't any grand metaphor I could really obtain from the material , at least from a first viewing , and Herzog seemed to be having too much fun getting the dwarfs to do both the mundane and whatever to get something consistently interesting . While he does have one character who ends up being quite memorable , the freaky-laughing , hilarious Hombre ( all one-note , of course , but then again isn't everyone here ) , there's nothing to tie the parts together that are worth watching for to make it good enough for the whole . There's surrealism of course ( the fate of the monkey and the car ) , and an image or two that strikes greatly ( when the headmaster or whomever tries to get the attention of the one-passerby on the island ) , but it just didn't compel me or surprise me in ways that Herzog at his best can do . Not that I'm telling you to not see the film , as a fan I mean . The title alone should be a calling card to anyone who might have a bit of interest in the subject matter , and I'm sure a work like this has inspired a few avant-garde director's out there ( I saw it as a possible fore-father for Korine's Gummo ) . Yet it's own lackadaisical use of narrative and Herzog's insistence on ambiguity and derangement , makes it a kind of schizophrenic work that makes it a fun yet flawed trip .
not Sam Jackson / Kevin Spacey Negotiator , that's for sure	Negotiator , a TV-movie directed by the inimitable Takashi Miike , is two-halves of a movie bread . The one halve is a perfectly terrific kidnapping picture , taking its twists but giving the audience its share of excellent acting and a low-key atmosphere to counter the grueling tension . The other half is melodrama cooked up to 11 and given to us to explain what the kidnapping plot at the hospital was all about - an inside job that goes a lot deeper and more personal than anyone could see . While all of the performances are top-notch , especially the actor Hiroshi Mikami who plays Inspector Ishida ( in one really fantastic dramatic scene , a real barn-burner in the 2nd act , one sees the depths he's gone to for revenge for his lost loved one ) , the script itself thinks its a lot sharper than it really is . It doubles back and gives us information , tricking us and folding us again and again into the mystery of what turns into basically a big ol ' pot-boiler . Which would be fine , except that Miike films it as if he's still in the same mindset he did Gozu the same year , with super-long takes in some scenes ( 5 minutes with an unbroken shot ) that are unnecessary and draw attention from what drama happens in the scenes . I applaud Miike for going a route that veers towards the more realistic and tragic in the sense of the characters , and it's a change of pace from his Gonzo works from that period . But its own low-key quality becomes the undoing , in some part , of the suspense that builds for an hour and then pops like a big fat bubble when we find out the circumstances . Negotiator is a movie I really wanted to like more than I did ; it tries patience even as it has a lot of rewarding elements and things going for it . It is , simply , worth its TV movie status .
a light touch helps from time to time , but it mostly works just enough thanks to the actors	Tom DiCillo is a cool New York-based independent filmmaker , and he's made some good stuff in the past ( most notably as DP for Jim Jarmusch , and as the director of sleepers like the great Living in Oblivion ) , and I wish him the best of luck on anything he does . But on Delirious , he only gets it right some of the time . He's out to , at first it seems , make a satire on media hype and celebrity and the inanities of shallow attention given to people who don't do much to deserve it ( if you need proof of that , watch the Soup on E ! ) . But then it goes a little in a different direction , which I respected and wanted to go along with , as a fable / fairy-tale where Toby ( Michael Pitt ) is just about the nicest , most generous and fish-out-of-dumpster homeless kid who somehow becomes an ' assistant ' to fledgling photographer Les ( Steve Buscemi ) , who shows him the ropes and introduces him to a casting director ( Gina Gershon ) , and eventually - accidentally of course - falls into the company of a pop star ( Alison Lohman ) as the two all but fall in love on first sight . Good premise , and scenes between Buscemi and Pitt most often work the best , and funniest , as one sees subtle layers peeled by Les's pathetic paparazzi who just doesn't admit he's not ambitious enough to not be marginalized as a photographer . There's even some good comedy thrown around , the kind that is that strange , absurdity that we also saw in ' Oblivion ' . But , somehow , it just didn't all click for me after a while . There's a very bitter pill being sent out in , often , very corny and ill-shot scenes ( the latter of which I could accept , but for one brief instant , as Toby walks back to Les's place the morning after he's had that whirlwind night with Lohman , I was shocked at how cheesy a scene it turned into ) . The problem , also , is that it's difficult to mix such a delicate romantic / fable angle while also working in some mockery at the entertainment business . It's all in good amusement to see the " reality serial-killer " show being directed for " realism " , but it all doesn't lead up to anything significant to say past some shallow messages . Maybe I didn't see what others have been ; it's become a minor little hit with most , and I'm sure if you have any desire to see actors like Buscemi and Pitt and Lohman ( who is also very good ) and Gershon ( and hey , there's even a really hip and hilarious cameo from Elvis Costello ) you'll seek it out anyway . However , it's not the best , or least obvious , game in town despite its solid indie cred .
this rare find is completely watchable on one level , almost in spite of itself . . .	You'd know why you'd want to find this film , as it's the ultra-low budget , barely-a-drive-in quickie that features the great Jack Nicholson in his feature debut at the tender age of 21 ( he was a mailman at MGM in his previous years in Hollywood ) . He plays a youth out of control , though also under duress . He's taken a woman and kid hostage , and outside the crowd builds in anticipation as the cops struggle to find a compromise to get everyone safely out . The film is complete with a theme song that just repeats ' cry-cry-cry , cry-baby killer ' , and in a style that is as polished as a junkyard dog . The story itself , by the way , is told in a way that is so simplistic and with over-acting ( or maybe too trying-to-be-realistic acting ) that is typical of this kind of un-pretentiously kind of fare . But the reason in the end to reach into the recesses of ebay or elsewhere to find it is to see Nicholson in his early larval stage of a career , and somehow he does make the work fascinating to watch . Obviously not his best by a long-shot , and his first big break in the B-world would come later in Little Shop of Horrors and even later in Easy Rider . However I did like how he was keeping his scenes pretty well grounded , keeping to the situation at hand with all of the confusion and shattered rebellion that's in a youth of his real age . It's almost like checking out the Beatles when they were still the Quarry Men or something - it's not necessarily ' good ' , but you might be surprised at how it's not really bad either .
an illustrious beginning to Corman's career	Roger Corman started off in the B-movie arena and never left , for better and for worse . This , his first film , gives the false impression that this will be some weird sci-fi movie with actual swamp creatures or something . Instead we get one of the early girl-prison type flicks that would later be popular in the 70s to a degree . Here an undercover cop goes incognito in a women's prison with three girls ( including Marie Windsor and Beverly Garland ) , and their plot to escape from prison and get some stashed diamonds in the bayou swamps . Then , as they are making their escape , they kidnap a man and woman ( including 3rd rate James Cagney knock-off Mike Connors ) to lead them along in their boat . But they need to watch out for their flaring tempers - and a few alligators here and there . It's all , of course , pretty cheesy and at best acted with a little estrogen-laden grit . It's fun to watch some of these girls going at each other in big ham-bone performances , and all by a first-timer Corman who can direct just about to not have us leaving down the aisles ( or our homes ) in droves . It does make it more worthwhile , of course , to seek out the Mystery Science Theater cut , as the boys rip into it where appropriate ( which is , indeed , quite often and with a relish , like with the alligator attack scene as they dub over completely ) . What is surprising , despite the obvious shortcomings , is that Swamp Women isn't a total loss . I actually enjoyed some of those scenes in the swamp , with the prisoners acting all bad-ass with their prisoners . Only when actual plot needs to be developed early on is it incredibly stagy . And , luckily , Corman ( or the " Cor-Man " that is to be lived by as comes up with his director title card ) , provides some substantial humor without the MST3K track .
good , if not great , follow-up to Batman the animated series	Batman Beyond was described by Paul Dini as meant for " selling toys . " It goes without saying how much merchandise works into Batman - lord knows that the toys and videos and movies make more money than the comics have in general in years - but it slightly underrates the strengths in this show . As a kids program , it's often very exciting , and even as a guy now moving along in age ( i . e . 20s ) , it's recognizably a cool , if updated , Batman reboot . To also say that it's nowhere near as groundbreaking or amazing or sometimes genius as Bruce Timm's original series from the 90s is also a given ; they're out to carve some new ground here , but it's only with new variations on characters and bringing back the ' relics ' ( i . e . old Bruce Wayne , Barbara Gordon , Mr . Freeze and Bane in a couple of episodes ) on top of the new ' versions ' ( i . e . Jokerz gang , which is in no relation to the Return of the Joker movie ) . As it stands , solo episodes not dealing with that opening struggle between CEO-cum-radioactive man Derek Powers and Terry McGinnis are not always that great . Sometimes they are , in spots , and other times they're mired in predictable action , plots , and characters that come out of the stockpile of clichés that kids can gobble up like M & Ms without much afterthought . In a sense it's like Buffy the Vampire Slayer , only not quite as imaginative or funny , yet still filled with big amounts of action and cheesy one-liners and villains that spring out of nightmares of high school and craziness . That's part of it , anyway ; as the series goes along some of the themes start to run deeper - not least of which Bruce Wayne's role as surrogate father / mentor to Terry - and occasionally it's even poignant . Most of the time , it is what it appears to be : Saturday morning fodder that is a step above The Batman series of late and is just a bit more than the ' toys ' angle .
quite a memorable raunchy comedy ( most of the time )	I'm tempted to give Clerks an even higher rating than I have here , almost out of a certain fondness for Kevin Smith being able to return to the ' Askew-universe ' and not stumble over his shoes as a filmmaker . It's not a flawless film , and when the filmmaker tries to go for some of the silly , warmer-hearted type stuff ( i . e . the go-kart scene , the Jackson 5 musical number ) and melodramatic , it doesn't really click with the rest of the film . Those parts are not necessarily bad , and are a step up from some of the cheesier scenes of Jersey Girl , but the real reason ( s ) to see the film , for fans of Smith and Clerks ( and even non-fans , though it helps to see the first film ) is for what made the first such a little iconic piece of filthy indie work . This film contains racist , sexist , outrageous-to-the-Nth-degree style comedy , but it is , for someone who does have a tendency to laugh at more politically incorrect , sexually explicit and just strange humor , probably the film to see this summer . And , of course , if you're easily offendable and all that , this might not be the film for you - this time I'm almost surprised that this didn't get into any NC-17 controversy like the first one did ( which was unjustified based on language ) . One scene kind of extends the highly charged and hysterically funny racial tension humor from the deleted Fat Albert scene from Dogma , and it becomes very funny not because there's some kind of enjoyment in what Randall is saying , but because of the lengths the jokes are taken to . It's possibly the funnest part of the film , though there are some other scenes that come close to their counterparts from the original . A LOTR / Star Wars debate is as much of an attack on the film ( s ) as it is just an attack on internet and other kinds of ' geeks ' , as the new supporting character played by Trevor Ferhman pretty much embodies , who adds at least a nice chunk of the laughs . Not to forget as well the presence of Jay & Silent Bob , the former disturbingly performing one of the funniest things I've seen all year to a specific piece of music . There is even bestiality jokes thrown into the mix , bringing the film to such a preposterous climax one can't help but grin even when it becomes ' too much ' . But a sequence like this , put alongside other scenes where ' hear-to-hearts ' come out or the previously mentioned ' moments ' , kind of act as a total contrast to the style of barbarous , witty dialog and gags Smith puts out for his talented cast . It's almost like now with Clerks 2 there are two very extreme sides , one being the mushy residue left over from Jersey Girl ( attempting to return to more Chasing Amy dramatic ground too ) , and the other being the constant slew of jokes that range from excretions and geekdom to plain sexual insecurity , not to mention drugs . Does it create as satisfyingly complete with comedy and pathos that Smith's best work has been ? Unfortunately no , however I still would probably count this as being the successful comeback that Smith was probably aiming for . It's a respectable sequel for fans and the like , and I may watch it again months from now - as was the case with the Aristocrats - just to hear the same better fed up bits again .
has a good mix of whimsy and pathos , an excellent Ferrell performance , if less than stellar overall	I'd recommend Stranger Than Fiction , especially if you're a fan of its stars . It also speaks to a good career ahead for first-time screenwriter Zak Helm . That it also is that old , over-used statement - the parts more entertaining than the whole - is maybe in part attributable to an inherent structural flaw in the script . After I left the movie I did think about how a person's will may be dictated or not , or what really carries that man to do what he decides to do , or if he tries to do nothing at all ( which Harold Crick , played by Will Ferrell , does to no avail ) . Because the story itself is about contrivance , their is an ever-looming air of contrivance in the script too . It's hard to explain exactly , and Helm was wise to avoid certain pit-falls , such as really giving a ' logical ' explanation to how the narrator's writing sticks into Crick's head in the first place , or that it might not just collapse once writer and ' character ' meet . But there's still some things that I found a little troublesome - for example , does the narrator dictate the little things that Crick does , or would Crick just do them anyway ? What I mean is , how much is determined by what is written or not . There is also the air of questioning where these characters are outside of their set spots in the screenplay - and Crick , albeit not without some interest is not really the kind of character I would think would make for a great subject for a book by a presumably well-renown , recluse author ( played in the best way possible in the one-note terms by Emma Thompson ) . For the sake of Crick's central change from being very calculated , precisely so , early on , to becoming a man much more based on how he wants to live his life not based rigidly on structure - even in the structure of ' little did he know ' , which is kind of amusing as a writer myself - there is that sort of contrivance anyway . Yet at the same time , individual scenes are very well written though , and given fresh life by the cast . Ferrell here , of course , is showing much more of his talents than usual , at doing much more of a grounded , every-day kind of guy who has the extraordinary happen to him . He's always convincing in the part , even in scenes that are awkward or made to really pull up more of his talents than usual . That I would still have a very slight preference for his comedy roles and skills as a satirist / performer may be just subjective , though this - plus his underrated turn in Melinda & Melinda - goes to relay how he can play genuine just as well as silly and fearlessly stupid . Hoffman , as the literature professor who helps out Crick through his crisis at points , is also very good , and their scenes together were some of my favorite in the film . Gyllenhaal works well too as the romantic side for Crick's change in self . So really , it's a worthwhile trip into what was appropriately called by one critic as ' Charlie Kaufman-lite ' , as it goes to lengths to be an original work , but at the same time one can't help but know how things will turn out in the end , if only from the immense heap of circumstance given clairvoyance , or vice versa , and that it is , in the end , a work out of Hollywood . Marc Foster's direction does go for little odd touches to add to Helm's writing , such as numbers and lines and such on screen in fast fashion to show Crick's mind working in the form of his life early on . And the watch means probably as much as the gold watch did in Pulp Fiction in the sense of what it will lead to for the character . That it doesn't feel though completely satisfying in its sort of original send-up is understandable , but partly forgivable ; it's the kind of work that gives talented actors some fun and variety , and there are at least a few truly laugh-out-loud funny moments .
a fun trifle from Mr . De Palma that takes advantage of inexperience	The bulk of the crew on Brian De Palma's Home Movies were his college students , but if you asked me where it looks it the most it's hard to say . De Palma decided to make it a challenge in as much that he thrusted these kids ( one of whom Mark Romanek ) into their first real foray into film-making , but he also lessened some of the possible stress on the situation in two ways : he took some of the same freewheeling , seemingly improvisational approach that he took with his early satires ( the great Hi , Mom and the decent Greetings ) , and he also made it a silly comedy based around his obsessions and personal history . It's a send-up of self-made stardom , adultery , male dominant control , and the craftiness in the craft of film-making , and it's very funny . But to say how funny it is or why would have to reveal too much of the plot , which I'd rather leave open ended for those who might find this in their local video store's obscure picks . All I'll say is that Kirk Douglas plays the Maestro ( introduced by a hilarious lot of egotistical opening titles ) , teaching a class about how he faltered in getting a young man , Dennis Bird ( Keith Gordon ) to move on from being just an " extra " in his life to being the star of his own making . Gordon's Dennis is the youngest in the Bird family , which includes an adulterous doctor father , a weepy and half-crazy ( and half all-for-attention ) mother , and a brother , James ( the scene stealing meat-head played by Gerrit Graham with the same tenacity as in Phantom of Paradise ) , who teaches a summer class on Spartanism to a bunch of impressionable youths . He's also getting engaged to Kristina ( always gorgeous Nancy Allen ) , but there's some trouble and friction in their possible " socio-economic contract " . Meanwhile , Dennis meets the Maestro while acting as a Peeping Tom up in a tree , and becomes an amateur filmmaker . Now , as this all sounds , it's a little stuck together in cheap style and rough edges , which adds to its charm . It's made almost as if De Palma knows it's something of a fluke , and just wants to get his students as enthusiastic as possible about the process ; it wouldn't be as much fun having them on , for example , Casualtues of War . And as one of De Palma's experimental comedies , it provides for the director , through a better than expected script from his pupils , to express some of his nuttiest scenes , including some scenes where Kristina has to unleash the " rabbit " , and the running gag with Gordon dressed in black face and an afro sneaking around at night . It's not anywhere near a great comedy , but for what De Palma was after it's a success . In short , it's a low-key hoot , and De Palma fans looking for some ridiculous and crazy gags and character development won't be disappointed .
If you can't afford LSD , try colour TV .	It's strange to see a work by a filmmaker that is a lesser one , but made during his prime . It's like watching a Godard that speaks to his future films - the much lesser ones - while still holding onto the quality of his work at the time . It came after Masculin / Feminine , a very good work , made during Made in USA ( unseen by me ) and before Week End , possibly Godard's quintessential attack / satire on culture and film-making . With 2 or 3 Things I Know About Her , we get a character who you might think at first is like the Anna Karina character in My Life to Live . She seems to sell herself for sex , but also just lives her life the way she wants it to . But it's really sort of three different strands going on concurrently - there's a pretty coherent look at a mother and wife , Juliette ( Marina Vlady , often as dead-pan as Godard can get her to be ) , who sometimes takes cares of her kids , sometimes just goes out to shop and socialize , and sometimes has absolutely passionless sex for money . The second strand almost comes as being like a pseudo-documentary - or a satire on one perhaps - where Godard has his ladies , Juliette and several others throughout , who break the ' 4th wall ' and talk right to the camera about their own state of mind and being and such . The third strand has Godard himself , in a perpetual whispering tone ( to get our attention , of course ) about the usual socio - political - philosophical - moral - cinematic - why - is - the - sky - blue narration that accompanies many a Godard film . And all of this , of course , with some of the most breathtaking cinematography I've seen in any of his work - there are close-ups that , as repetitious as they might've been , really did work . Like with the coffee - we see the coffee and the bubbles , and the colors swirling , while the narration keeps on going . There's even a very self-conscious moment where the camera blurs , the narration mentions blurred perspective , then when things come into ' focus ' on both ends . In fact , this is not only one of the most self-conscious of all of Godard's work , but one of the most self-conscious films I might have ever seen . Not that this is an immediate negative , and in this framework Godard's intentions , aside from giving a good kick in the nuts to conventions and what the usual even means in typical words and descriptions of ' things ' much less with cinema . There's almost a sense of consciousness expansion he's after in this self-consciousness too , which is par for the course for a Godard film . And it's also loaded to the gills with bright primary colors ( this was continued into Week End , though with that in much greater , striking effect ) , and product placements galore ; it always gives one a grin to see his great love / hate relationship with items from mass marketing and produce . And , of course , those title cards . But what ends up lacking from the film for me , and why I would only consider it a good Godard film as opposed to a masterpiece , is that I get a lot more fulfillment watching Godard's work when he just loses all abandon of common plot-sense , and just makes almost an video essay with plenty of semantics , a loose story , and an eye for locations and people and scenery and products and all sorts of things that show him being instinctively good with the camera . . . BUT , that it's also entertaining . It's not that 2 or 3 Things I Know About Her isn't never quite interesting , but the fulfillment I got out of it was more of being so familiar with his work that I could get a kick out of things I could already expect in the changes of form and moments of contemplative narration , not really out of any emotional connection though to anything with anyone in the film . Juliette , unlike Karina's Nana ( who , by the way , as a tongue-in-cheek in-joke appears in a pop-art style photo on a wall in one scene right from that movie ) , is at least 70 % of the time not really a character in the usual sense : if anything she's more of a mouthpiece , a kind of figure for Godard to put forward his ideas of feminist / radical thinking , done in a manner of voice and inflection that is always the same , rarely shifting . Maybe that's part of the point , and by the end we may know more than two or three things - especially about what she's thinking and attitudes on gender and the whys and why nots of just living and existence - but emotions are almost null & void in this world . In the meantime , as Godard maybe knows he doesn't have enough of a story with her ' real ' character , when not talking to the camera , as a wife and mother , he shifts attention at times to random moments with other women , like one who talks to the camera about her banal existence ( " I walk , climb , see a movie twice a month , etc " ) , or with a sort of touchy sexual discussion in a bar . The focus actually is never too grounded for Godard , which is partly what I mean about this film hinting at the descent his films would go to in the 80s and 90s ( at least from my point of view ) . It's not JUST about women , it's almost about everything - drugs , culture , TV , politics , war ( Vietnam especially , quite the topical philanthropic satirist he was ) , automobiles ( a funny bit happens with a red car too ) , literature , morality , and all that and a bag of 60's-era Godard chips . It's worth checking out , I suppose , especially in widescreen , but not as something to see right away if getting into the director's work - I think if I had seen this as my third or fourth Godard film I might've disliked it even more . As apart of a stretch of films , I respect it and am involved , but compared to the others it's not as successful in terms of it really connecting more than it does .
" ah ah , Azuki beans , I love them "	What a strangely wonderful , if sometimes slight and bulky , big-budget fantasy this is . Takashi Miike had already proved , by the time he got to The Great Yokhai War , that he could dip into other films aside from his supposed niche of the crime / yakuza genre ( Visitor Q and Andromedia showed this , the former great the latter lesser ) . But here Miike , in his first and only co-screen writing credit no less , proves that he can deliver the goods on a post-modern soup of mythical fantasy conventions , and with it boatload of CGI , creature-effects and make-up , and an epic battle that is more like a " festival " than something out of Lord of the Rings . The comparisons can be made far and wide , to be sure , and the most obvious to jump on would be Miyazaki , for the seemingly unique mixture of kids-as-big-heroes , power-hungry sorcerers looking for the energy of the earth as the main source , machinery as the greatest evil , and many bizarrely defined , flamboyantly designed creatures ( or Yokai of the title ) . But there can also be comparisons made to Star Wars , especially to the Gungan battle in TPM , and to the whole power-play between good and evil with similar forces . Or to anime like Samurai 7 . Or , of course , to Henson's films . And through all of these comparisons , and even through the flaws or over-reaching moments , it's Miike all the way with the sensibilities of effects and characters . Here , Ryunosuke Kamiki plays Tadashi , the prototypical kid who starts out sort of gullible and sensitive to things in the world , but will become the hero in a world going into darkness . The darkness is from an evil sorcerer , who gets his energy from all of the rage and wretched vibes in the human world , and who is also starting to put to death the spirits and other creatures , the Yokhai , into a fire that sends them into gigantic robots that have only one mission - to destroy and kill anything in their paths . Tadashi gets as pumped up to fight Sato the sorcerer as the Yokai once Sato's main minion and cohort , Agi ( Kill Bill's Chiaki Kuriyama , another great villainies ) steals Tadashi's little furry companion , a Sunekosuri . Soon , things come to a head , in a climax that brings to mind many other fantasy films and stories , but can only be contained , up to a point , by Miike and his crew . I would probably recommend The Great Yokai War for kids , but in the forward note that it's not some watered down fantasy in American circles . This has creatures galore , including a one-eyed umbrella stand , and a walking , talking wall , not to mention a turtle , a fire serpent , and a woman who became cursed by Sato . So the variety is on high on that end , and one might almost feel like the creatures and effects - which grows to unfathomable heights when the " festival " hits with the Yokai reaching hundreds of miles in scope . But there's also a sense of fantasy being strong in both the light and the dark , and Sunekosuri becomes perhaps the greatest emotional tool at Miike's disposal ( and not just because it's cuteness squared ) ; where else to get an audience riled up than over a little furry ball of fury , who ends up in a tragic battle with Tadashi in robot form ? Yet through all of this , the sense of anarchy that can be found in the brightest spots of Miike's career is here as well , which distinguishes it from its animated , Muppet and sci-fi counterparts . There's the bizarre humor as usual , including a song dedicated to Akuzi beans at a crucial moment in the climax , and more than a few flights of fancy with the creatures and fight scenes ( I loved , for example , the guy with the big blue head who has to make it smaller , or the anxious turtle-Yokai ) . The biggest danger with Miike's access to bigger special effects and computer wizardry , which he flirts with , is overkill on this end . He's got everything down , I'm sure , with storyboards , and he creates some memorable impressions with some compositions ( one of them is when all is said and done , and Tadashi and the ' other ' human character are in the middle of the Tokyo rubble in an overhead shot ) , but the CGI is sometimes a little unconvincing with the robots , and the interplay skirts on being TOO flamboyant , and some visuals , like the overlay of the Yokai spreading the word about the big festival on the map , just seem weak and pat . I almost wondered if Miike might dip into ( bad ) Spy Kids territory , quite frankly . But this liability aside , The Great Yokai War provides more than a share of excitement , goofy thrills , and innocent melodrama that came with many of the best childhood fantasies . It owes a lot to cinema , as well as traditional Japanese folklore , but the screws are always turning even in its most ludicrous and veeringly confusing beats . It's not the filmmaker at his very best , but working in experimentation in a commercial medium ends up working to his advantage . It's got a neat little message , and lots of cool adventure .
a throwback to very good " light " Hollywood Hitchcock , with virtues and vices ( mostly virtues )	We need more filmmakers like Tony Gilroy in Hollywood right now . Coming off of his debut feature Michael Clayton , after years of working on stuff like the Bourne movies , to his second film Duplicity , he's marked some strong territory as a guy who can work with top-shelf A-list talent and put them in material that is mature just enough to make it safe for the 30 + year olds to see it and not think their intelligence is being wasted . His films provide such a wealth of juicy scenes of dialog and plots that make us think about what the characters will do next as opposed to just spoon-feeding along the conventions . And even if Duplicity is not quite as excellent as his first film ( and suffice to say it's got a couple of things that make it tick ) it's still a marker of fine entertainment . At the least , it makes for a strong matinée viewing , if one were to rate it such . Like one of those features from the 40s or 50s from Hitchcock where he would place Cary Grant and ( insert blonde bombshell here ) , Duplicity relies on its stars , and sometimes its dependable character actor supporting players , to make it more about watching them and how they go about the material as opposed to the real specifics of what to worry in the plot itself . Hitchcock wasn't worried about what was really in the " secret " formula since he knew , maybe rightfully so , that the audience doesn't really care either . When will Grant and Kelly have that kiss ? It's certainly a lot more fun trying to explain how well Clive Owen and Julia Roberts fit into this classic Hollywood couple mold ( not to mention since it's their second time on-screen following the more theater-based Closer ) and play off one another than describing how " one is a MI6 and the other CIA and their operatives in these corporate firms and one might be making a toaster oven or yada yada and they both do A and B and . . . " So yeah , basically Duplicity is about conning and about not believing what the other person is saying , but at the same time Gilroy toys around with the idea of people who are stuck in a world where by proxy they can't trust one another but get each other so well who the other is at the same time . The characters Tom Wilkinson and Paul Giamatti play - who , by the way , share one of the funniest and most awesome opening credits sequences I've seen in years - are playing checkers in their corporate one-oneupmanship games , but it's Roberts and Owen that are playing chess which is a little brainier but trickier at the same time . One might criticize that there's almost too much of this back-and-forth guessing and curiously trying to figure out what the other is saying about something . But if done right in a film it can be fun to watch just to see what move or motive or revelation will come next . And Gilroy has casted these two stars so perfectly that you can lose yourself in these scenes where they keep playing the same guessing games ( some dialog deliberately repeated ) . This helps especially when the actual plot becomes a little silly , and particularly when it's revealed in the last ten minutes what the big TWIST has occurred . It won't do any good to explain what it is , but suffice to say it's a little too convenient to put into exposition , and it's been done before . In a script that is otherwise sharp and clever and dramatically pleasing in construction and character Gilroy falls back on a couple of tired devices towards the end . It comes dangerously close , as Ebert pointed out , to saying simply " who cares ? " But , thankfully , Duplicity does , for at least roughly in total of the running time , give us characters to care about and go along for the ride with and so have this sheer joy of an A-list movie that tries to be about the guessing game and cons and covert operations and the nature of this whole thing Gilroy's dealing with . And the last shot , thankfully , tries to put a good coda on everything that's happened . It's a glossy , breezy time in usually the best way .
Great Example of a war picture	Thin Red Line is a great example of what a war film can be . Unlike 1998's Saving Private Ryan ( which I thought was the best film of 1998 ) , this film doesn't have a plot with a big beginning and ending ( even though that would be nice ) . It just chronicles a group of soldiers and their battle in the South Pacific , and with themselves . Good character study , and some good monologues by Sean Penn don't make this the best war film ever , but it isn't bad either . Pretty good effort by writer / director Terreence Mallick who returns to the screen after a 20 year absence . Big screen cast includes Penn , Jim Chazviel , George Clooney , John Travolta , Woody Harrelson , Shawn Hatosy , Elias Koetas and Nick Nolte as a powerful General .
gets better if you see it more than once ( the old saying , but it's true )	I don't know if I'll ever think Syriana is a masterpiece or great film or worthy on a top 10 list or other . But it's something that sucks me in when it comes up on TV , and after seeing bits and pieces - following already seeing it twice in the theater - I have a grasp on it , firmly . It's a political drama / thriller about big oil and terrorism and lobbyists and behind-closed-doors negotiating and death and torture and so on and so on . It's confusing , but it's really not so if you pay attention . It's just that Stephen Gaghan's script is so dense that you're bound to loose yourself in the specifics of what's happening when or why or through what channel or whatever ( Jeffrey Wright's character's story , arguably , goes through the most to try and get the thinking viewer to pay close watch ) . But there's also some strong dramatic connections going on , things that bring out the humanity , or the suppression there-of through bigger-than-life business and murder and sadism , that make it worthwhile . Particularly the strongest asset is George Clooney , which he got the Oscar for ( albeit as a possible sympathy vote for ditching him on his other two Oscar noms for Good Night and Good Luck ) ; his portrayal is calm and with an underlying sorrow that's crushing at times . This guy's seen so much , and knows likely too much , for him to be kept around long in a government that will sell out anyone for the price of big oil . To see him go through a small scene like that with his character's son , or to see him in a dark movie theater sharing a secret with William Hurt's character , or being tortured , or going for broke in the climax , is exhilarating ; his scenes probably ground the film , at best , for the audience . It's everything else that you'll need to try and keep an eye on : the tragedy of Matt Damon's character , a market-watcher in Europe who's transferred to the mideast , and that of Wright's professional who gets in deeper and deeper in corruption , are a little trickier to navigate . And it's frustrating in that , unlike Traffic , it's a more challenging script than that of direction and storytelling ; we're never too sure where it's going at times in the mid-section , but to keep engaged is the tricky part even as the script dazzles with its spot-on , mature dialog and little subtle twists ( the king's son who doesn't want the power , and then explains to Damon's character why , very good scene ) . The best thing to do is to go in knowing what to expect , and then take it on the terms of how it goes : an intentionally confounding take on the biggest , most incredulous industry in the world . You might wonder if the " addiction to oil " even means anything . " Corruption , " Tim Blake Nelson's character says , very directly and dishearteningly to the point , " is why we win . "
amiable enough skewering of the Israeli / Palestinian conflict with fast food and singing	Strange that West Bank Story didn't live up completely to my expectations , but then again I only knew about the film - and anticipated it - from the five second clip shown during the Oscars ( right before it won ) , with a high crane shot showing a bunch of Israelis and Palestinians dancing in the street . It was something out of left field among the nominees , and it gave me and those watching the Oscars a big belly laugh . Unfortunately the actual 22 minute short film only contains some scattered laughs , and doesn't go so much for outrageous political satire as much as lighter skewering of the two sides in a simple context : fast-food . West Bank Story gives us the two chains - Hummus Hut and Kosher King - each with their own wacky decorum ( Hummus Hut with their kebab-hats , and the one employee at Kosher King in a large menorah costume , the latter being maybe the funniest sight gag ) , and equal hatred for the other . A plot is hatched by Kosher King to build a wall ( " Jews in construction ? " is the Hummus Hut's response ) , while the other plots to simply burn down their opponent . But meanwhile , the sister-employee of the head of Hummus Hut falls for an Israeli soldier , and the two of them try to get the two sides to stop fighting . Sprinkled throughout this short are some funny moments of cultural lampooning , like hummus being confused with Hamas , and a split-screen during a musical number with Kosher King and Hummus Hut ending in an argument between which side is encroaching on the other . But overall trhe only criticism , however a significant one , is that it's so brief that only so much can be done with the material , and yet the director Sandel and the writers only go after a few specific things , leaving out more scathing possibilities , ala Mel Brooks or other , to go for the jugular with a touchy topic . It's a safe little comedy , but worth watching at least once , with some catchy songs and small winks to the original Wise / Robbins classic .
I think I may agree with the notion . . .	. . . that Federico Fellini , one of the most gifted and visually wild Italian directors of the 20th century , blossomed out until with his masterpiece 8 ( which , by the time he got to , as Martin Scorsese once said , " he was on Mars " ) . With his first solo effort , parting ways with Rossellini but not entirely from neo-realism , he went back to one of his passions - comic-book writing . Los Sciecco Bianco ( The White Shiek ) is likely one of Fellini's funniest works , and it shows him gearing up his visual sense of space , and with his trademark characters ( set , which is his usual , in Rome ) . The story is quite simple and , for the novice to Fellini's daring feats of the 60's , entertaining and accessible . A man with a level of pride in his family's connections in bureaucracy and religion in Rome ( played by Leopoldo Triste , with perfect usage of wide eyes ) , is married to a young woman , Wanda ( Brunella Bovo ) . She loves him , but finds him perhaps a little un-easy to be around for a day . So , she sneaks off for what she thinks is just a momentary call for fandom - she's a big fan of ' the white sheik ' , the star of the kinds of comics being printed in Italy ( mostly for women , as said on the DVD , they were still photos as opposed to drawings , with pulp / love stories ) . But , in a Fellinian twist , Wanda gets whisked away by the shooting crew of the series , and Ivan ( Triste ) is stuck in one of those text-book comic situations , where everything is " under control " . The results are rather funny , if also intriguing . The little characters are also what makes the film fun , aside from our lead couple , and with this film we get the white sheik himself , Fernando Rivoli ( Alberto Sordi , who finds that line between a stealthily romantic type and hopelessly dim ) , and the crew , filled with their little comments . Plus , there is a late-night visit to Ivan in a despairing state , from Cabiria ( later to appear in one of Masina / Fellini's best combinations , Nights of Cabiria ) , involving a flame shooter . And as the film unravels , it becomes key to the fun - we know things will turn out right somehow , but how is what makes the film work ( unlike Fellini , some might think , as many of his other films are the opposite , with flights of fantastical comedy in hopeless tragedies ) . It's not a great film , there are some inconsistencies , and at a couple of points the pace loses its strength . But if this was a place to evolve from for the director , it's not a bad place in the slightest . That there are wonderful turns for Trieste , Bovo , Marchio , and legendary composer Nina Rota , is another reason to watch it .
just slick enough , just well-acted enough , just with that hint of good vs bad that make it work well	There probably isn't anything too groundbreaking in Absolute Power , and maybe it's all the better for it . It's an above-average by-the-book thriller ( not by the numbers , there's sort of a difference I'd rather not prattle on here ) , and it's more than suitable that Clint Eastwood is director . He takes a handle of William Goldman's good if predictable screenplay by casting very well and making a point about how simply ruthless the world of the cover-up is as well as the double-cross . There doesn't need to be much else said since so many other movies and books have done better , so as a " well-oiled " machine , as it were , it functions like amazing brain candy . We get Clint as an aging thief who lives off his disability money from fighting in Korea but still likes the thrill and just the process of planning for a heist . But the place he heists from , unfortunately , is the home of a very old man ( EG Marshall ) who happened to get the President of the US elected ( Hackman ) who proceeds to interrupt Eastwood's robbery with a girl , gets into a big nasty physical fight with her , and the secret service kills her . That's when the ball of wax begins to ferment and un-bend . Now , granted , if you've read your share of books to read on an airplane it's nothing new . Yet this is a sort of challenge that Eastwood takes on , in a sense . Meaning , if you're thinking what you'll get is something too generic that you'll just want to tune out of , stick with it . . . the film goes into a very sturdy structure , one that allows for a few good surprises and twists , contingent on Eastwood's Luther being a cunning criminal mastermind who can slip into disguises and copy signatures and send trinkets like , say , the murdered girl's necklace to the Chief of Staff as a " present " from the president . It wont blow your mind with these twists ( though the final one with Marshall and Hackman is classic , and fitting final note for Marhsall as an actor ) , and it's fine with what it is . Also a big help is the cast , filled with either real stars like Eastwood and Hackman or just great character actors like Linney , Scott Glenn , Dennis Haysbert , even Ed Harris to a degree as a character actor is very good . This is suspense film-making for those too bored to usually bother late at night or watching some channel like TNT . It's good , very good , as long as you know what it is .
the super comic-book movie event exists - and it's very good , impressive , not a masterpiece or a failure	It was called the classic " unfilmable " line , but Alan Moore and David Gibbons ' Watchmen was film-able , and oddly enough after over 20 years of directors from Terry Gilliam to Darren Aronofsky to Paul Greengrass taking the possible helm the most commercial choice imaginable , Zack Snyder , made it film-able , and indeed a very good movie . How he accomplishes this is fairly straightforward : compress as much as possible of a 12-issue comic book series into a 2 hour running time , cut off certain pieces of fat ( most notably the Black Freighter story which will be on DVD soon anyway as a bonus ) , and keep the structure and character development and stories 90 % of the same . Also , make it about as accessible as possible to a mainstream audience without , possibly , insulting intelligences much . Indeed this is an incredibly faithful adaptation all things considered - " things " being the fact that after reading the book , still ( and I'll sound cliché like many others ) the most compelling and daring and magnum-opus-of-all-time works from Moore and in the form itself , most of the details save for a reasonably crucial bit in the climax were left intact . Snyder knew to not get too much in the way of the story and characters would be a wise move , and it is in the sense that if a work is as rich and satirical and dark and violent and sometimes warped sometimes lucid and fairly tragic like the Watchmen it's best not to get in its way as it goes along . For what it's worth , this is the best Watchmen film that we can expect from Zack Snyder , touted as a ' visionary ' in the ads based on two good but definitely not great films Dawn of the Dead and 300 . Because when he does not let the story well enough alone and puts his " signature " directorial touches on the proceedings , which is mostly slow motion , repeatedly , sometimes in annoying quick bursts that don't add anything of worth to the hyper-realism portrayed , it screams too much ! But , again , this thankfully doesn't happen with the kind of regularity and overbearing force of 300 , and he can sometimes direct action really well . I'd even go as far as to say he's improved as a filmmaker , mounting such an impressive production with a cast of primarily character actors ( matter of fact no real BIG stars ) , by taking the story where it needs to go both for those familiar and / or in love with the book , and for those looking for some solid entertainment . I haven't described the plot yet . Here it is in a sentence , if I can try : it's 1985 , Richard Nixon is still president ( and Vietnam was a victory ) , America is at a close possible WW3 scenario with Russia , and superheroes are outlawed - and one of them , the Comedian , has been bumped off possibly , as masked psycho / bad-ass Rorscach thinks , by a killer of superheroes , leading to an investigation by him and other drama unfolding with the actual " American Superman " Dr . Manhattan and his sort of love interest Silk Spectre . If that's barely scratching the surface of it all then so be it , since this is even in the framework of the film ( and I mean this as a compliment ) dense with detail and motivation and dramas of the personal and big-time Earth scale . Since the storytelling itself , with some of the exceptions I mentioned up before ( another being a different twist done from the book for Veidt's plan ) , is solid and cunning and even featuring a more-than decent selection of songs , what about the cast ? It's a mixed bag , frankly , but one that is at the least inoffensive and at best truly inspired , if perhaps as givens . Jackie Earl Haley , Billy Crudup and Jeffrey Dean Morgan go totally into their characters of Rorscah , Dr . Manhattan and the Comedian , making us feel for them just as we did in reading the text . Outside of that , for non-readers of the book , they're still fabulous performances , particularly for Crudup's very subtle touches in inflection ( perfectly near-noticeable ) and Haley as a tortured soul who sees fit to strike fear into anyone that might cut him down just a single peg ( and , unlike Bale's Batman , I really believed Haley doing a super grunty voice for his character ) . If nothing else , the back-stories with Manhattan and Rorscach , and to a slightly lesser extent Comedian , are little great shorts in the midst of the epic running time , and are supported by these actors bringing their characters full of life and sorrow and so-black-it-stings humor . Goode , Wilson and the actress playing Silk Spectre are not quite as good , and maybe just fall totally flat maybe as the point but are still nowhere near as convincing as the three big guns . Even an unreasonably funny scene like Night Owl and Spectre making love isn't totally convincing because of the acting . In closing . . . Watchmen , worth seeing ? Yes , very much so , especially if you're a fan already , but maybe so as well if going in blind . A masterpiece of a blockbuster ? No . It's got some problems in a few scenes such as with the BAM BAM kind of style that if I were a crankier old critic I'd use as an example of the music video age destroying movies ( it doesn't bother that much , but it still does subjectively ) . It was , happy to say , worth some of the tremendous hype . This being said , if you haven't read the book , do yourself a favor and read it first . Then see the movie . It's an excellent movie to talk about .
the director's cut is a vast improvement	When I first saw THX 1138 , it was in an obviously cropped-for-TV , scratchy tape print , and my enjoyment of the film was there but limited . Last year , writer / director George Lucas released the ' director's cut ' of his first indie-style science fiction film , and I have to say its a big improvement . Many have argued over Lucas ' usage over the years of touching up on his Star Wars films , but them like this don't seem too compromised . In this case especially the visual effects enhance many establishing shots , and some exciting , surreal ones , that weren't too developed in the original 1971 version . The performances haven't changed much - Robert Duvall is strong , intense , and thoughtful as the title character , who has to come to his own free will somehow in order to find a way of escape from this cold , controlling , computerized world . Donald Pleasance also gives an off-beat supporting performance as a ' friend ' of THX's . The themes Lucas deals with aren't anything very new , but the twist on them , the magnificent sound design by co-writer Walter Murch , and the perfectly , visually artful camera-work , makes the film successful on its own terms . Like the comic books that inspired Lucas , its familiar , Orwellian territory , but is also arresting emotionally , and has an unusual way about it that keeps true with the updated special effects . Here is the avant-garde Lucas of his early years - bold , odd , slightly pretentious , and unique .
slice of love story Sundance fest style : strong pros , some cons , all David Gordon Green	All the Real Girls is a love story , but according to director David Gordon Green on the DVD he would almost not want to explain what it's about . The reason for this turns out to sound , perhaps , a little too high-minded or poetic , maybe just pretentious , as he expounds upon the way the sun hits the two and a half legged dog and that that's what the movie is ' about ' . In short , he explains , the movie is just about how we are . That's possibly a good way of explaining it , or reasoning it or whatever , since the film is not entirely classifiable almost in spite of its more typical and tender elements . But as a work of a director like Green it is something that is all his own , for better or worse ( mostly for better ) , which is something that has been seen in the work he's put out so far with the possible exception or amendment of Pineapple Express . It's by no means a really great love story nor a really great film . Yet as someone who has tried to crack writing his own relationship dramas , this struck a chord . There are real scenes of truth , of revelation and insight , and tenderness and the resolve to try and accept the way things are which can never be done . Paul Schneider plays a character named Paul ( how close to real life I leave to you to figure on ) , who is something of a town Lothario , albeit not really proud of it as we later learn . He and Noel ( Zooey Deschanel ) fall for each other despite the angry protest of her hick brother Tip . We then see the relationship unfold as something of a first-young love scenario , both for Paul and for virgin Noel , and how it plays out against some more specific drama and character interplay with Paul's frustrated hospital-clown mother ( Clarkson ) and friend Bust-Ass ( Danny McBride ) . As tends to happens in certain young-love movies , there's something that happens that occurs that mucks the whole thing up - more-so for Paul than Noel in one of those ' funny ' kind of hard to take ways - and yet Green even treats this as well as other tougher moments with care and attention to how real and awkward and truthful the actors should play it . This doesn't necessarily mean all the scenes work completely or feel a little jagged with the patient ( not really slow ) pacing . But when they do work they work very well , like a confession Noel makes to Paul in the hotel room , or a silly scene at a bowling alley . And while Green paints his ' canvas ' of sorts with this sleepy blue-collar North Carolina town with some arty montages ( the SKY , the high-speed factory , hills and landscapes , pretty pictures ) , the actors are surprisingly good with seeming to do so little . Part of that is the subtle strengths in the writing , and some of it is just how Scheider and Deschanel keep things simple and sensitive . Even Whigham has a good scene expanding his character . Clarkson is also a given for doing small wonders on screen . If it's not quite one of the most mind-blowing romance films I've seen this decade , it might be that I wasn't entirely in the right frame of mind , or didn't find all of the little scenes with the supporting characters worked as well as the central " plot " ( in quotes for redundancy ) , or that the music is sometimes placed in ill-fitting scenes or is too sappy for my taste . These criticisms aren't to say it's a very well accomplished effort , a small and intelligent picture that doesn't cheat on its characters . It is familiar , and it feels very much a true Sundance fest effort , but it's better than others I've come across for its originality and tact .
it will be rare to do but , if you can , watch it with a live organ w / 35mm print	One of those nice stories to hear about : a film starring two of the most glamorous and true-blue STARS ( in caps ) of the 1920s was lost for the greater part of the last century and then discovered in a Dutch museum , and then restored for viewing on DVD and TCM . Viewing it any way you can is delightful , but really , if it's at all possible , the best way to watch it is in a theater preferably projected from 35mm with a live piano accompaniment . It is rare to happen but well worth the while , especially with the right organist ; the material begs to be given lush and melodramatic rhythm to go with the lush and melodramatic storyline . It might not be the very best silent film you've ever seen , but as far as these old-fashioned romantic will-she-or-wont-she movies go it could be a lot worse . It's one of those stories : a girl needs to betroth a rich gentlemen to help out her family , and she does reluctantly , but her heart is soon to be linked to a man who saves her not once but twice , first time from drowning after falling out of her rowboat and again when she slips and nearly falls off a cliff . There's a few of those moments where one laughs at something kooky being played straight - the honeymoon is spent in the mountain where there's clog-dancing or other - but it's really about these two characters , Lord Bracandale and Theodora , coming together . Moreover , it's about the stars playing would-be lovers on screen , with the sexy symbol of his time Valentino substituting for all those lonely women who would love to be in Swanson's shoes . You could guess that so many in the audience would yell out " just leave with him already , he's friggin ' Valentino ! " Granted , Sam Wood is no master of cinematic drama , but he's a strong craftsman who directs his stars extremely well , getting some restrained and touching performances filled with those little gestures or those sad or loving looks that make up so much of what makes silent films tic . And there's also a supporting performance Robert Bolder that has its moments . Only once did I get slightly fidgety , which is right in the scene where he's deciding on whether or not to go off on the expedition ( it dragged slightly , even for just its few minutes as one wants to get back to the stars ) . The rest of his performance , however , was splendid , particularly when he discovers by a misplaced letter about the love affair between the Lord and Theodora . The final desert scene is also a knockout of melodramatic proportions . It's always something nice when a good film is unearthed for all cineastes to take in , and Beyond the Rocks provides its audience a match-up comparable to the likes of Brad Pitt teaming up with Angelina Jolie or Roberts with Owen in the recent Duplicity . It's engaging to watch the story and yet it's not the reason we're watching : there's something to the chemistry between Swanson , a beauty who doesn't hide her curves and tender but knowing exchanges , and Valentino , who could melt the right girls face with a glance . It's a fine little relic meant to be seen on a big screen .
a messy movie , but not a mess , this is a film with an attention to its method of its unconventional style	Wong Kar Wai doesn't play by the rules , and those who respond positively to his films wouldn't want it any other way . While he's recently gone a little more measured and controlled with style ( relatively speaking ) with In the Mood for Love and 2046 , it's mostly in that he's now using things like dollies and steadi-cams . Looking at Chungking Express and , particularly , Fallen Angels , he reveals himself as a filmmaker total in trust with a style that in other hands would be simply amateurish . His camera , led on by Christopher Doyle , follows along these characters like in a slightly feverish documentary , with the accompanied narration adding the emphasis on inner thoughts and details . It's a crime drama , but it's also a fresh way to look at material that has a little bit of quirk , a heap-load of attitude , and at least a good lot of romance , or the lack of it or the pining for it with these characters . It's equally sweet and rough-edged , like an adorable motorcycle . For plot , there's not much : two male characters , one is a hit-man who's starting to feel the pressure of his job ( ironically , he describes it as being a good one early on as " I'm a lazy person . I like people to arrange things for me " ) , and breaks off from his partner , a woman who cleans up his ' messes ' of mass destruction , and then falls for a strange blonde girl . The other is a mute ex-con who robs people by being obnoxious at various one-night-stand type of jobs , and in the process meeting a girl whom has a freak-out one night ( there's an amazing scene , I should add , where in one shot we see him fall completely for this girl with a soft blues song playing behind him describe this as his first love ) . At least , that's as much as I gathered from the essentials ; there's also a sub-plot with the mute kid , He Zwhiu , and his father as he starts to videotape him all the time . But Wong isn't interested in plot mechanics as two central facets : mood of a scene on technical fronts , and a sensibility that's close to poetic intent . Wong's camera moves in a way that is a little dizzying , and it feels like it should be a shamble , a fiasco of an art-house item that doesn't transition well to the US . But it becomes apparent that its form is , at least , consistent to the intent at hand . We're so aware of the style that the characters are seemingly organic from this urban , post-modern spread . They're more than a little alienated ( watch that shot where the woman is in the café , and the fight breaks out behind her without flinching an eyelash to the situation ) , and they have the tendencies of youth trapped in a situation they can only break out of ( for one it's a way of life as work that gets mixed up due to emotions with the partner , the other with his father and going past disrobing the homeless and conning a family with ice cream ) . Wong Kar Wai presents this amusingly at times , a brisk sense of humor dropped in to let the audience know ' it's OK to laugh here and there , they ARE human after all with all their idiosyncrasies ' . But at the same time there's a sorrow to the material that is given life by the hand-held , by the shots of characters in mirrors , by mixed media , by black and white shots thrown in , by editing that cuts off the head of the 180 degree rule here and there , by pumping in sad music and it does come close to diluting the emotional impact of the characters's fates . And yet , Wong has the soul of a romantic at heart , so to speak , and despite the fact that there's some pretty violence scenes in the picture ( done in that hyper-speed style that is a little slow , a little fast in a way , as one has seen in many HK crime films ) there's an intelligence that steers it from being TOO sloppy . This may be arguable , to be sure , in either direction ; some may even call it a masterpiece of post-modernism as well as those who can't stand it period . I don't necessarily think it's even Kar-Wai's best film . But it inspires so many fresh images and thoughts I can't discard it as a warped slip-up from an otherwise avant-garde darling . If anything a film like Fallen Angels lifts up his reputation as the Chinese answer to Godard ( minus , of course , the Maoism and the reading excerpts of books on camera ) .
If you can find it , and it isn't as bad as the copy I watched , it's . . . sorta courageous , and strange	Jean-Luc Godard and Woody Allen . Just by those two names you will know if this short interview-film , which has been seen by likely less than a hundred people since it was filmed almost twenty years ago , will be worth to see ( and 80's era Godard and Woody no less ) . Basically , you get Godard's madman sensibilities as a filmmaker , playing around with the structure of a director interview , and you get Woody Allen's insights . Ironically , I think this was made for video , or at least shot on it ( maybe it was shot on film , I'd have to look it up ) , and more than half of the interview is based around the idea ( that Godard proposes and Allen agrees with when understanding ) that television is a corrupter of the audience . But along with questions , and even more interesting answers , about television , there are also questions and answers about the film-making process , and how Allen feels about it . While at times Godard tries to back up to TV again , one does get of course what Allen is like - immensely underrating his films once finished , and at times finding the film-making process to be more of a distraction from the other horrors of the world . Godard does ( and sometimes doesn't ) succeed in adding to these words of Allen's with spliced in images from his films , other filmmakers ( Orson Welles ) , and New York city buildings , among other swell oddities . Really , it isn't the most intriguing interview with Woody to date , but to see what his take on film-making , TV , Hannah and Her Sisters , and other things was like then in 86 is worth a peek . That it IS Godard at least brings some initial fascination , then some frustration , then , well , acceptance . This is a fairly courageous way of presenting what could be standard , pat-on-the-back interview fare ( Godard does pay a compliment once or twice ' Hannah ' , though that's it , in his old-school Cashiers du Cinema ways ) . How Allen feels about his films won't be news to those who saw Richard Shickel's documentary on him . But just to have this film in your possession - if you would feel as strong a compulsion to see it based on the two names of the directors ( known in their countries as the most intellectual , stimulating , & / or pretentious filmmakers around ) - is a temptation that somehow lured me in . However , if you do seek it out , know well that the copy of the video will more likely than not be watchable only up to a point . It's literally one of those ( perhaps minor ) works by a director that end up on lists of all-time rarities , for better or worse . AMENDMENT : This interview is now available on certain sites online .
near-underground film adaptation of a stage play and , as with others , makes me excited for the play much more than the actual film itself	I never heard of The Balcony until someone recommended it highly to me , and perhaps it's understandable why it sits still in obscurity . The name Jean Genet is far from unfamiliar to theater-buffs , and in fact he was one of those real surrealist playwrights that stretched the boundaries of what was possible to portray on the theater . In the case of this play it's about manufacturing dreams , of control during wartime and the cynical belief that people can be dominated by desire and thought and deed , which maybe isn't far from the truth . It's a very strangely structured play , but its unpredictability is a major asset ; we may predict that another fetish or some kind of subversive ideal will be projected , but the way its written about and acted about is the amazingly peculiar thing . Genet teases and prods human nature while going into something new we haven't seen before . It's a challenge I was glad to take . This being said , I cannot recommend The Balcony as if it's one of the all-time great " lost " treasures or other . At best it made me very intrigued to see how it would be done on stage , perhaps ( or just most likely ) in an off-Broadway production . It's not without a sturdy cast , with Shelley Winters turning a good performance as the " madaam " of the fantasy brothel of sorts where outside there's chaos and war but inside she controls all ( it's not a total knockout performance like say Lolita's mother , it's about right for the character though nothing really remarkable except in small bits ) , and Peter Falk as a personally wounded and disgruntled army person . Lee Grant is also a sight to see , as is Jeff Corey as a mixed-up Bishop , and Leonard Nimoy ( yes , Spock ) appears with a couple of minutes of real inspiration . That isn't necessarily the problem though . If there's anything that could be pointed out it's just the way the film is shot and music is used and little important film-making things like that . Joseph Strick isn't a bad director , matter of fact he has a few moments of crazy inspiration that make it worthwhile ( i . e . the three " guys " going around the rubble and addressing the " crowd " of stock-footage ) , but he doesn't bring any truly fantastic style to make this during-apocalyptic tale something haunting . Many shots are too static , and the music by whoever it is comes off as out of place or not matching well enough the surreal nature of the material . In fact , this might be one of the handful of projects I would be interested in seeing as a remake . It's prime material , daring and provoking in the best ways . It's just missing " something " to it , which may explain it's slightly obscure status .
how to turn such a matter-of-fact physical activity like swimming into cinema	Jean Vigo knows he can't be too bland with a subject like swimming , no matter how good the swimmer might be in his style and speed and graceful varieties of stroke ( so to speak ) . Jean Taris is actually an excellent swimmer , as Vigo makes abundantly clear within the first minute : in a simple over-head shot , with the occasional close-up cut-away , we see Taris defeat his opponents in a swimming race lickety split . But it's how Vigo then treats the whole nature of how to instruct the audience on a topic that makes it worthwhile to find ( it's available on you-tube , by the way ) . We hear the Taris voice-over describe the different movements that can be used - including the " new " one , called the breast-stroke - and that , simply , swimming cannot be taught indoors . Vigo puts his words into an assemblage of images that reminded me of the great scene in L'Atalante with the character Jean underwater , only here taken steps further , and visually it's always a wild little treat . Like his Apropos de Nice movie , Vigo is out to explore possibilities with the frame and the camera and certain techniques that today might come off a tiny bit goofy , but nevertheless display a true resiliency on part of the filmmaker and his technical crew ( notably Boris Kaufman ) . It's all experimentation , but it ends up working better in its favor due to the step-by-step narration and detail . A constant image is that of the swimmer going backwards out of the water into original diving pose , which doesn't lose its appeal as eye-catching . There are also the many tight close-ups from a multitude of angles as the swimmer goes about his instruction : his arms , his feet kicking , his face trying best not to somehow get too much water in the mouth while breathing . And perhaps the most interesting bit when we see the swimmer underwater , likely seen through an aquarium or some other safe place for the camera , and the Taris goes through many different movements . What begins as a relatively easy-going tutorial short on film , by way of the inventiveness of the filmmaker , becomes something much better - a subjective lesson in the art of swimming . There's even a touch of the absurd to much of it , as is the way of the director in his works , like when he does show a man trying to swim indoors , on a chair . And the final images , by the way , are definitely the best , as one last time the swimmer comes up onto the side of the pool backwards , then is seen in a business suit , jacket and hat , and in a great super-imposition walks ahead into the water . Whatever it might mean , I can't say , but throughout as Vigo's eye follows this man on his lesson to those who wonder ' can I be like him ' , there are moments of wonderful exercises in limitless cinematic expression too .
could've been corny and preachy but is actually rousing and tough and formidably directed	White Squall is based on a true story ; ultimately tragic but also of the ' inspiring ' sort we get often at the movies . It could've been the kind of corny ' this is what I learned and now I'm blah blah ' kind of storytelling that gets excruciating after a while in Hollywood movies . Apparently , thankfully , Ridley Scott knew this and took on White Squall as a challenge : take a character ensemble , the kind of ' male camaraderie ' picture that with a few alterations ( i . e . reduce some sexual content ) could have been produced in the 50s or 60s with a Burt Lancaster or other as the lead , and make it mostly tough and sentimental only in that rugged John Ford sort of sensibility . He succeeded admirably as his film is what it wants to be , which is surprising considering the " it's Dead Poets Society at sea " criticisms I had read online . It's fairly old-fashioned in some ways , but its presented in all the ways that matter . What's also impressive is seeing Scott attempt an ensemble based around character and , up until the last quarter of the picture , not really based on plot . He's done other pictures that have been ensembles , in fact a lot of them , but mostly they're wrapped around the story as it unfolds . In White Squall a lot of things happen , and characters come and go and lessons are learned and there are even a few tears , but it's based around character and it's fascinating to see Scott work with this nearly loose structure . Certainly his cast is a big help , as Jeff Bridges makes an equally formidable lead as the Skipper of the Albatross , the ship for a group of young men going for many months out to sea to " become men " , or rather take the SATs and become a stronger community on a ship . While we only see snippets of how excellent he can be as an actor throughout until the final agonizing scenes during and after the ship wreck , the rest of the cast holds up just as well ( Scott Wolf , Balthazar Getty , Ethan Embry , a really good Jeremy Sisto in an unpredictable ' rich kid ' role , and John Savage as the older ' intellectual ' type ) . It goes without saying sometimes White Squall does run into some hokey or just some territory that is almost put in as an intentional INSPIRATION scene ( in caps ) , like when the boys are at the remote island and run around up the hill to sign that buried book . Yet it's not what doesn't work but what does that makes the film impressive , and it holds up extremely well against its counterparts that don't have a keen eye for the facts in the story as well as making the characters not simply cardboard cut-outs . It's pretty conventional , but in the finest way imaginable , and has a pretty amazing climax out at sea with the title event ( maybe not Perfect Storm but without computers all the more impressive ) .
takes on the egotistical qualities in artists - and gangsters - in Allen's very funny send-up of Broadway	Now this is something sort of rare , though not really : Woody Allen mixing satire and drama , and the satire actually even more convincing than the drama . The opposite was in a more serious affair , Crimes and Misdemeanors , where art and murder and infidelities all get into one big pot of personality crises . This is the same case with Bullets Over Broadway , though this time Allen's tackling of the ego-maniacal crutches of the Broadway scene - the aging star Helen Sinclair ( Dianne Wiest , one of her very best performances , funniest too ) , the bumbling boob Olive Neal ( Jennifer Tilly , appropriately annoying - and then how it sort of infects the outsiders to the major Broadway scene , one the protagonist David Shayne ( John Cusack , excellent here ) , and Olive's bodyguard , Cheech ( Chazz Palminteri , a character he could play in his sleep , but played pretty well anyway ) . Cheech is hanging around during rehearsals of David's first play he's writing and directing , following getting funding ( on the condition of Olive as a psychiatrist ) from a heavy-duty mobster , and soon he's suggesting ideas , and in the process becomes David's uncredited collaborator . But meanwhile infidelities are abound , with David falling for the wonderfully self-indulgent Helen , and a goofy romance between Olive and the thespian Warner Purcell ( Jim Broadbent ) , leading to a purely ironic climax . Allen's skills at navigating the neuroses of all the characters is very skilled , and sometimes the one-liners are surprisingly funny , all based on the personalities ( Wiesst especially , in a voice that is a little startling at first , gives a classic line about the world ' opening ' up , and her running gag with " don't speak " ) . Even with the more dramatic connections , which doesn't seem to be as much of Allen's concerns since it's pretty one-note with the mob side of things ( and , frankly , the fates of Olive and Cheech sort of seem a little too contrived for the sake of the irony par for the course ) , we do get a very memorable bit to make things worth the while , like David and Cheech's down to earth talk at the bar . But if there's anything else to recommend more strongly it's for the sharpness of the script in the theater scenes , the backstage banter , the hilarious tension stirred up by grudges and ill-timed romances . Plus , there's a bit of an added treat for fans of past Allen films , where he casts Rob Reiner in a role sort of similar to that of Wallace Shawn in Manhattan . Not a masterpiece , but a very enjoyable work that's successful on its dark-light terms .
One of the few comic book adaptations grounded on the theme of mood over action ; pros to serious movie-goers , cons to others	Ang Lee's filmed version of The Hulk , unfortunately , won't appeal to all those within the mainstream spectrum of movie-goers . I can guess ( hearing from a few of my friends who are true-blue comic book addicts ) fans of the comic will be pleased , however those who may not be fans or admirers and are simply looking for the kind of non-stop action and campy , tongue-in-cheek humor of Spiderman may be disappointed . Ang Lee has taken Stan Lee's vision of the ultimate perturbed anti-hero and created a work that can appeal to viewers with an darker art-house sensibility as well as viewers with a thirst for action-adventure blockbusters . In a sense this is similar to the approach Tim Burton used for Batman fourteen years ago , though his was given a shot of adrenaline and hilarity from Jack Nicholson as The Joker . The Hulk doesn't really have any overtly flamboyant characters like that to chew on the scenes they steal , so rather Lee looks at its core as a story of parents ( notably fathers ) and their children . Children who are tainted from missing and shattered childhoods from their before they can completely remember . Sam Elliot's Solider and Nick Nolte's Cast-out Father , perhaps , are the most important characters of the film after the protagonist Bruce Banner , as that they set the Jekyll and Hyde-esquire story in motion and carry / deliver much of the emotional weight that follows . Eric Bana is scientist Bruce Banner , un-wittingly following in his father's combustible career , who wants to use gamma-radiation to help out frogs in studies , and unfortunately gets caught in an accident of catastrophic proportions . There is , he finds out , something inside of him , ever since he was a child , that gets released into the open by the radiation , and the monster within becomes an unstoppable freak of nature . The gorgeous Jennifer Connelly plays his once love interest and only true friend , Betty Ross , who gets caught in a crossroads after her father , a military man who put away Banner's father away thirty years earlier , gets involved in the pursuit . It isn't just Lee's interest in getting to know who these characters ARE that makes the film fascinating , but in his stylizing of the medium - he has split screens in moments we'd never expect that give the film a comic-book edge , just how when reading one we may look at two or three of the pictures at once for it to sink in . His use of close-ups creates an intensity in seeing and getting to know these people . Rarely in a superhero movie does one look so intently at the eyes . A major drawback , I felt , were the action set pieces . They were certainly above the texture of the Spiderman scenes , yet the Hulk never looks truly real enough to commit total sympathy or other emotional connection to him . The fight scene with three dogs is one of the best fights of the summer , and a climax with Banner and his father is a near powerhouse , but the climax just before it goes on for far longer than it should . But , I suppose that notion could be considered Sour Grapes since I've never read a Hulk comic and only seen snippets of the old TV show . By the end of this character-driven roller coaster , I knew I had seen a well made comic-book adaptation , better than most I've seen in recent memory . But I wanted more , or perhaps less , than what I was given . Notle , by the way , has crazy Oscar-calibert-meets-campy work here , as does the editing by Tim Squyres .
witty and with enough emotional depth and intelligence to carry the subject matter ; good debut for Ashby	As one of the scruffy underdog filmmakers of the 1970s - who's career unfortunately faltered in the 80s before his untimely death at 59 - Hal Ashby was good at taking a set of characters and a particular idea or theme and getting under the surface just enough to make a mark , while also keeping it an oddly entertaining and accessible as a picture for the art houses . Also , it shows Ashby coming out of his cocoon of editing jobs ( he even won an Oscar , for Jewison's In the Heat of the Night ) by giving the Landlord a very particular rhythm . Many times he'll just let a scene play out , giving the actors the freedom to work with the script their way , and then other times he'll implement montage - or just a subliminal cut-away ( or not so subliminal , as Lee Grant envisions an African tribe going to the Park Slope building , and a whole pack of black babies upon hearing about a little ' accident ' her step-son caused late in the film ) . I was really struck by how he uses experimentation for equal uses of humor , abstraction , and to just feel out the mood of the character ( s ) in the scene . Like when Brides runs to meet with Lanie at her school , and it's inter-cut with images from Fanny at her apartment , and Lanie , and a couple of other things . It can be called ' European ' - and Ashby was an admitted fan of Godard's - but it feels unique to the sensibility of the production and the ' radical ' feeling of the period . Meanwhile , Ashby has the best photography back up a first-time director could ask for : Gordon Willis and Michael Chapman , who give the film a look sometimes of lightness , especially when Elgar is at the family home and the walls are all a bland white , or seem to be ; then other times they light it darker , like in a more intimate setting like Elgar and Lanie out by the beach at night , or just when at the Park Slope apartment . A scene especially with Elgar and Fanny is effective , not simply because she actually comments on how the red light makes her look a certain way - it's the timing of the actors , the awkward but strong sexual tension , and the red light , and the soft soul music coming up , that makes it one of the best scenes Ashby's ever filmed , thanks to the right team . If the style verges on being a little " dated " here and there , like in the opening minutes as Elgar talks to the camera and says what he intends to do with the tenement , or those extreme close-ups of Elgar kissing with Lanie ( which are quite striking on their own ) , its attitude towards the pure human problems of race haven't diminished that much . I liked seeing Bridges , who is spot-on as the total naive future yuppie who's heart is in the right place but confused how to really go about it as the new landlord , interact with the other apartment dwellers , their ' welcoming ' by chasing him away with a flowered pot in his hands , or at the party when after getting him good and drunk tell him what it's really all about in first-person takes . And most of all it's funny and challenging to see , especially during a tense period around 1969 when it was filmed , how essential decency on either side of the race coin could get complicated by love and lust , of the rich family understandably not understanding how Elgar could go through this - not to mention the eventual ' mixed ' dating and the pregnancy - and at the same time the tenees never totally knowing why , aside from foolish design ambitions , wanted to run the place to start with . The best laughs end up coming from the awkward moments , and the obvious ones , as the subtle moments are meant to be more quiet and the ' big ' laughs to come from the interaction of not just in terms of race but class ; watch as everyone in the building uses the drapes from Joyce ( Lee Grant in a well deserved Oscar nom performance ) as clothes and head-dressing , or when Joyce has some pot liquor with Marge , who knows her better than her own family probably does . And who can resist the NAACP joke ? Or a throwaway joke about dressing up as a historical figure for a costume ball ? Ashby and his writers ( both screenwriter and novelist were African-Americans ) know not to slam every point home either , which uplifts the comedy to an honest playing field , which means that when a scene like the quasi-climax when Copee finds out about the pregnancy and flips out with an ax at Elgar it's not really all that jokey , when it easily could've been played as such for an exploitation effect . Only the very ending , which feels complicated by a sort of need to tidy things up with Elgar , Janie and the baby , feels sort of forced ( not helped by the end song , not too ironic , called God Bless the Children ) . But as it stands , the Landlord is provocative fun , if that makes sense , as it works as cool satire , led by sure-fire performances ( Bridges has rarely been this good at being true to a mostly unsympathetic character ) , and it points the way for a career that the director would have where oddball slices of life wouldn't mean there wasn't larger points being made . It's one of the best bets as an obscure find a film-buff can have from 1970 .
Pixar knows how to do formula just right - a lot of fun in an " old-fashioned " story	Cars is the kind of animated film that , considering how computer dominated the realm is now and might be for a while , knows what it is and is successful almost in spite of what it could've been . It could've been , for example , a clunker of a formulaic animated movie where not only do you know what will happen every step of the way after a while the imbalance of comedy and the rest of the more grounded parts of the story detract from any pleasure from seeing the movie work on its own . Pixar , and particularly its co-founder John Lasseter , are particularly based on the importance of the story - however much it might lend itself to others - and having the best cast to go alongside the most believable visual schemes . Cars worked for me as being something that is akin to those " old-fashioned " picture of its kind ( which I mean here as a compliment and not as some kind of put-down like others might ) , where after a little bit in the story you'll know what will happen , but it's fun seeing what's done within the scenes and how unexpected bits of delight come from the characters . Cast-wise , it's actually rather remarkable ; this might be the only time , for example , I won't mind a Larry the Cable Guy performance in a film ( playing a dim-witted towing truck ) . Practically every part , in this case , gets the right choices along-with having the star power . Owen Wilson is Lightning McQueen , who has a big ego as an up-and-coming race car driver . He gets sidetracked , however , when getting into a big accident ruining a road of a small , near-deserted town full of quirky oakies and long-forgotten types . The amount of supporting talent is commendable - Bonnie Hunt , Cheeck Marin , Tony Shalhoub , George Carlin ( was happily surprised at that one ) , and Paul Newman delivering a good show as a car with a shattered past . Through the story then comes the usual thing - Will Lightnign McQueen suddenly break past his young self-contriteness and find who his friends really are ? The answer shouldn't have to be too mysterious to find , but that's not the point that Lasseter and co-director ( late ) Joe Ranft are getting at . If the film does have a couple of liabilities - most of the songs are my least favorite of any of the Pixar films with the end-credits one the exception ; a couple of scenes don't work as well even within the conventions - it's got plenty to admire . As usual the animation team at Pixar gives the audience what they pay to see with this kind of picture - plenty of fantastic sights , with impeccable details with little things like the road itself and the cars and buildings as well as the vast , cool vistas delivered . Thers's also a sturdy , good-natured message behind the story and scenes , with the nostalgia of a period evoked alongside that of the usual ' don't forget what's important ' ideal for kids . And as someone who doesn't really watch Nascar or much of that at all ( even for the crashes that remind painfully why less than 1 % of the country does this ) , the racing sequences are tremendously well done , especially when sitting close to the screen . At the end of it , I knew I had seen a very good movie , even if in some little ways it doesn't completely POP like the best of Pixar's work . It's also the first really good take-the-entire-family movie of the summer , at least on a level of spectacle and all-around entertainment .
mostly crackerjack heist plot with a few great performances	This is a little like if Jean-Pierre Melville were forced to do a recreation of No Country for Old Men . Rather than that , it's a Don Siegel picture , which means there's things about Charley Varrick that make it both wonderfully character-centric and rather cold and vicious deep down . The latter isn't necessarily a bad thing ; done right , as here , there's a sinister edge to Charley Varrick the film , not too pronounced , and a lot smarter than other run-of-the-mill crime pictures . It's also , sadly , a little dated , showing some signs of its 70-ness in some small but significant ways ( i . e . how easily it is for Varrick to sleep with Boyle's secretary since all it takes it flowers , or for that matter the hit-man with the passport lady ) . Even the music by the great Lalo Schifrin screams " Freak-out ! " But it's also so well plotted and giving the audience its due and not treating us like fooled that it's hard not to admire it , or even love it in spots . At the least , Siegel is both a skillful director of action ( the getaway from the bank , and the heist itself , are near classic sequences of delirious suspense ) and with veteran character actors . Matthau in the lead is a smart choice . He's an actor who can hide a good deal with his stern exterior , but we can tell there's a lot going on underneath , and with Varrick he paints him as a character always making a deliberate choice , by default almost having to be one step ahead of the other villains or cops , and there's an extra level of tragedy he does brilliantly to subdue when Varrick's wife dies from the bullet wound . Ditto then for other actors like Andy Robinson ( not too far removed from his stint in Dirty Harry but a little weaker ) , Joe Don Baker ( the grinning hit-man with a one-track mind ) , and John Vernon ( again , from Dirty Harry , here a corrupt banker who gets his just desserts ) . It may not have the same kind of finesse that a higher budgeted action picture might have , but for Siegel it should have no less an amount of care for the story than Dirty Harry or Escape from Alcatraz . We might not get Clint this time , but it's still darn good enough to keep as one of those 70s sleepers that you find at the bottom of the bin at the store , a nugget that has future re-used Tarantino lines like " pair of pliers and a blowtorch . " And few movies have as good an ending at a junkyard as here .
not exactly " safe " , as it's attained more of a cult-status than a full-blown mainstream success	Marathon Man worked best for me seeing it really late at night , all the lights off , almost close to the twilight hours . It was here that the film was able to put forward its full power of thrills and chills , so to speak , but also with a very thick , icy comedy to some moments of it . It's also got Dustin Hoffman who , along with his turn in Straw Dogs , has rarely since gone to lengths in a thriller to really work hard for the material . This time he plays a guy who is maybe closer to himself - aside from all the running of course - but thrust into an incredible situation involving a mad German doctor ( Laurence Olivier , in his most disturbing role to date , maybe his most memorable by contemporary standards ) , after his brother is killed . It's also a case of a movie being much more memorable for little moments than for the overall . A romantic side-bar between Hoffman and his female counterpart in the film isn't nearly as interesting as the villain dilemma . Little moments with Roy Scheider ring off well . But more than anything for me , aside from the obvious " is it safe ? " scene ( where torture got to be its most wrenching and harrowing as any until Reservoir Dogs in an American film ) , is the beginning of the film . After we get the obligatory montage of Hoffman running , Schlesinger and writer William Goldman thrust the viewer into an almost completely absurd yet very real and horrific conflict between a German driver and a Jewish driver on a road in Manhattan , and its in equal turns darkly funny , cringe-worthy , and daring in being as exciting as it is shocking . Both drivers , with their rickety cars and rage amplified by the racism that gears up - leading them into their ends - don't seem like actors , but more like people Schlesinger picked up off the street . This even tops the big climax at the reservoir for me as being a wholly successful , near-perfect scene , and about as excellent as anything in Schlesinger's Midnight Cowboy . It's maybe less than great due to some of it early on being a bit too conventional , but when the thrilling aspects of it do kick in , like seeing Hoffman really having to run for his life , it can hook a viewer in not expecting much . Marathon Man also marks as one of the rare successes of Robert Evans career as a producer .
a very sad but rewarding experience about those who can feel but can't see or hear	Land of Silence and Darkness was Werner Herzog's first documentary . He still had a little bit of ways to go in terms of his style in a straightforward mode ; the same year he made an experimental abstract documentary called Fata Morgana that showed him already a master of " directing landscapes " and getting a mood and setting that was unique . With LOS & D it's a little different - it's a little like the German equivalent of one of those touching documentaries that are on HBO every now and then . He's mostly there not to make any grand visual statements or ubiquitous metaphors , but to capture this insulated world where people survive against all obstacles . It's in the Herzog vein of thought and execution , of showing painfully human beings who've been unfortunately by no fault of their own into a fringe group where the act of communication has to be an obstacle itself , that the film is most powerful . Fini Straubinger is one of those gentle , courageous souls that deserves to be shown more in film , and Herzog has her pegged as a good subject - someone who communicates to those who have none ( dead-blind boys from birth who barely know how to swallow let alone learn the alphabet or ' good ' or ' bad ' ) all through hand-pointing . While Herzog lays on the orchestral strings over scenes that could be silent themselves , the people speak volumes about how the spirit of humanity and the goodness of human beings can live on in the right circumstances . There's a subtext that Herzog reaches at well of the neglect the people have been served , of some people like the woman who used to use braille but forgot and are put wrongfully in sanitariums , when they could be in the right care functional up to a point in society . So there is that part that is a running theme in most of Herzog's work that's striking , the society at large with the stragglers , those that are just trying to keep up . And out of this he makes at least a few moments , without much interference , into little moments of documentary poetry , like the boy who is ambivalent but finally does go around in the pool and feels ecstatic about being under a shower . Or the simple composition of the young man who can barely eat a banana , but merely the slightest bit of work from Fini gets him reacting . Wedging on the line between unsentimental and sentimental is a hard thing to do with a group like this , and on a first feature-length documentary Herzog tries and for the most part makes it a brave turn on a subject neglected and bright and moving . It makes sense he would say that this is the one film he's made in decades that he wants to be available most ; ironically it is overshadowed by the more astounding ( if more crowd-pleasing ) work with Grizzly Man and Little Dieter . Even if it isn't a great film , it is a must-see , which is rare in documentary film .
Not the best season , but . . .	This is actually the third season of the hit HBO show Spawn , but it lacks at times some of the power and vigor of the first two seasons . There seems to be more of an emphasis on plot lines that don't have as much significance - as in for example the Billy Kincaid plot line in season 1 - for Spawn's fate . But if I have to choose between this and some crap show like That 70's Show , I'll say bring on the hellish gore , drama , sex , and intense vibes . In this season , Spawn continues his trip to get rid of his demons , at any cost ( despite some mis-shootings in Wanda land ) . Some good things , like the side plot with detectives Burke and Twitch and the guest appearances ( Eric Roberts , Robert Forester , Ming Na-Wen , Jennifer Jason Leigh ) . Great series , but knowing it might be the last , I didn't get enraptured as I did in 97 and 98 .
pretty good for me	I have only gotten in part in on Monty Python's Flying Circus , so this was good terrain for me to get through , kind of like getting one of those compilation records of the Beatles that they put out in mass droves when fans just didn't get enough from the actual albums themselves . Nothing apparently is ' original ' to the movie itself , in other words no segments were made especially for the film ( aside from the animations possibly , though even that I can't be totally sure of ) . But one of the good things about seeing the film at this point is that I got to have a lot of laughs with the sketches I'd already seen and liked ( some of them , like the Parrot sketch - albeit classic in a kind of vaudevillian way - aren't necessarily my favorites ) . I really enjoyed the ones too I hadn't seen , like the Marriage Guidance Counselor sketch where Michael Palin is in one of his funniest bits to date . Other classics I really do love , especially on repeat viewings , are the Lumberjack song , with it's always expectable joke funnier than the first , Killer Cars , Man with Tape Recorder Up His Nose , Expedition to Mount Kilmanjaro , and especially the Self Defence Class ( maybe my favorite , albeit it might've worked a little better on the show ) . Flasher too . Sure , it might be a little disconcerting to see some sketches that didn't make it in , or that there are some in there that shouldn't be . It's also a little lackluster - at least in comparison to the later Python films - due to Ian McNaughton being a TV director and more used to the point-and-shoot style of TV as opposed to the camera almost being in on the joke too with Holy Grail and Meaning of Life . But it certainly wasn't a waste of time either .
maybe not the perfect film it's hailed as , but it is a classic tale of coming-of-age , the continuous loop of life , all in embracing Technicolor	The River is , understandably , very high on top of film-buffs ' lists of favorite Jean Renoir films . It's also a picture that needs a little patience on some more modern viewers ' parts - it's more meditative than it looks at first , and despite the narration from adult Harriet ( taken , I would guess , verbatim from Rumer Godden's original semi-autobiographic novel ) coming off every now and again as slightly padded to certain moments that should be without a word spoke , it takes the nature of the environment , the locations , the people , the culture , the spirituality , all at a simple subjective viewpoint . Which , in a way , makes it more powerful than it would be had it been put through some kind of filter of a native . Renoir knows that he's a foreigner , and that Godden was as well , so that it's at times almost anthropological in the side glances at the Indian life along the river . Through this perspective , and in the framework of a ' coming-of-age ' story , is a warm , mostly innocent film of love and life . It would be one thing to try and deconstruct the performances - it would take too long than is allotted on this site . Suffice to say Renoir does much with a cast that have either acted mostly in character-acting parts , or ( in the case of real life one-legged Captain John played by Thomas Breen ) not much at all . Even from an actress like Patricia Walters , who under a less careful attention to detail would seem as spoiled , or petty and intolerable , as a Veruca Salt , in Harriet there's a tenderness there when she has her heart broken over and over again as she watched John fall into the arms of Valerie . I especially liked how she stayed true to that sense of bewilderment , disillusionment that has to come at that age when concerning the passing of life ( the tragic death of her younger brother , the truest innocent in the film ) , and what it means to really love and love back . She might still seem all frustrated and confused in that final scene in the boat with John , but it works nonetheless at the emotional side . Other actors like Suprova Mukerjee ( her only significant performance in a film ) and Radha , with her sad eyes , also contribute heavily . Only Nora Swinburne feels like a ' conventional ' English matriarchal presence , though not as a ' bad ' thing to the story . What should likely be discussed more than anything are the visuals , the look , the style , the carefully ritualistic world that the people along the river contribute and take away from and how they're depicted . Renoir , as has been written , didn't want to put any of the usual Hollywood stereotypes of tigers and elephants and such in the picture - his reverence also contributes to the meditative quality , how there's at times documentary qualities to how the narration goes over the movements of the river scenes . And maybe the most daring scene being the unbroken take of the dance in Harriet's story , where the woman has to be in-line with the camera-work ( as Scorsese , major fan of the film , noted on the DVD , there's no dolly for Renoir ) , and never misses a step to the exquisite beat of the music . Any other director might go in for the close-up , or go back to a long-shot for a master , but here it's like a scene in Singin in the Rain : we're privy to every step , as the length of the shot becomes part of the dance , of ( not to sound pretentious ) the communication of it . I don't even listen to much Indian music or watch the dances , but it's spellbinding in the case of the River . And , along with The Wizard of Oz , some of Powell and Pressburger's late 40s work , and Johnny Guitar , it's one of the most superb Technicolor films of the period . As many a modern viewer will not take into account ( I wouldn't of had I not gone to an art museum lately ) , Renoir is the son of one of the great painters ( forget impressionist , just in general ) , and it's to this that one can see pitch , brightness , the depth and scope of a palette used to its fullest . It could be argued that The River isn't a masterpiece in terms of the story or characters , but I'd hate to be with the one who'd argue about how the color doesn't work or doesn't sit well . Aside from the painterly compositions , it's just a very pleasant film to look at , and it would be for this reason I would seek it out if it plays on a revival screen in New York City or other .
might be my favorite Hughes's brothers film ; gritty , hard-hitting , relevant	Dead Presidents has in its story a tale of desperation and sorrow for a period where young men were perpetually let down by those around them , and took the easy way out through crime . But somehow , just as much as Menace 2 Society in its own style , is relevant for today , or at least the period it was made in a dozen years ago . It's inarguable Vietnam made these guys the way they turned out , but it's not the sole catalyst . It's also the mood of where they grew up , the crime that was already inherent in the ghetto they were at . It's about the struggle of breaking out of a place and time that is all the more rotten for what the country they're in did to them by sending them off to unjust war . That's the " message " , anyway , but it's only once or twice hit home harshly . The rest of it is driven by tight , extremely talented film-making , a contender for best thriller of the year where there were many good ones ( not as ' fun ' as Desperado , but with a depth and sadness to the scenes of thrills ) . It's also great to see the actors in the film work so well , including Chris Tucker - given more to do here emotionally than any other film he's done - and a small part from Keith David , who's somewhat underrated in his time as a fantastic character actor . Then there's also the bank heist , which is in and of itself dynamite , and the main plot of the deterioration of the romance between the characters that gets frightening . Even the resolution , which seems very matter-of-fact and bleak ( watching Tucker on the couch ' watching ' the Al Green song is a sobering moment ) , works very well . Dead Presidents isn't truly great art or whatever , but it does showcase the talents of the Hughes brothers better - or at least with more articulation and determination - than any other they've made ( and all four they've done are well done , particularly From Hell and Menace 2 Society ) .
Argento's first film is his first Giallo , and one that is sharply crafted , amusing , chilling , and even eerily jazzy	Dario Argento's first dip into the directorial pool is a pot-boiler somewhere in the realm between Hitchcock and Jack the Ripper , classic noir and the " modern " cat-and-mouse serial killer picture . Argento's method's may still be in a slightly embryonic state ( i . e . his intense stylistic flourishes , which by the 80s would seem totally ridiculous in comparison to Crystal Plumage ) , but already on his first film as director - not on writer , however , as he penned all odds and sorts of spaghetti westerns and thrillers - he assumes control like it's second nature . Suspense sequences involving the coolly suited knife-wielding killer , with Argento trademark black gloves , and a long trench-coat and black hat , come off without a hitch , and not without the kind of excess gore that he and other Italian Giallo directors got branded with throughout the 70s and 80s . Damned if I'll say this , it's probably the one film by the director you can show unashamedly to your grandmother . Tony Musante , an actor I've never come across , impresses ( as far as a protagonist in an Argento film can such as this ) as an American with his girlfriend who are in Italy for some reason or another ( a writer it would seem , as we only are told in one or two scenes , which is just as well ) . He witnesses an attack on a woman inside an art gallery , the only witness in a string of what has already been vicious murders by butcher knife , all women , all unconnected . He just wants to leave , but he has to stick around to give more details . And then , lo and behold , he grows more and more intrigued and involved in the case till , of course , he and his girlfriend become a target by this sadistic killer ! All of this is handled by Argento as if they're not the conventions that we all know in this kind of thriller ; he approaches all of them with a fresh take , and adds in doses of unexpected humor to keep things interesting ( the painter behind the possible clue-painting with the killer in a field and his cats is incredibly funny ) . But it would be just one thing if Argento kept at making near-golden Hitchcockian ideals and the pulpy juices of a genre piece moving along . Argento is out to depict a sense of paranoia , growing and growing upon an aesthetic that is not quite the Master of Suspense , and not quite your common Dirty Harry thriller ( though Ennio Morricone's score sounds like a mix of his quintessential touch and some Lalo Schifrin thrown in for good measure ) . In a sense Vittorio Storaro's cinematography throws one off guard ; it's at times not so shot like your common thriller , but as something more ambitious , something that drills away through its premise to dig up any pure cinematic threat to the characters . This might sound a little pretentious , but just watch certain sequences , like when Sam is being trailed by the man in the yellow jacket , or when the second female victim is seen , point of view changing without a beat misses on either end . Thanks to Argento's backup of Storaro and Morricone , he has here a twisting tale of a psycho killer with an artistic edge . It's clear to see , even with the ending that yells out as bad Psycho exposition rip-off , that he was on his way to a solid career .
Dario Argento is twisted and , in his own way predictable , but his film Phenomena is irresistible for connoisseurs of horror style over substance	Dario Argento is a macabre master of technique , and with Phenomena he reuses a previous premise ( many times has this plot happened with Argento with the young girl going to a boarding school of some sort with a murderer in the midsts after the main girl ) , but with startling , uproarious but effective results . We should find some of this as amusing - a chimpanzee as a companion / servant to Scottish wheelchair bound emptamologist Donald Pleasance , and Jennifer Connelly's character , Jennifer , who can communicate and bring the wrath of swarms of insects - and I'm sure Argento , knowing what he's doing , recognizes the finer points of the insanity in his work . But he also turns up the screws in terms of the ' creep ' factor ( hence it's American re-edit dubbed Creepers ) , with sequences that edge on the self-conscious and the sublimely terrifying . Simplistics of the plot , if there is one to speak : a young girl is sent to a boarding school while her famous father is off in the Phillipenes . She befriends a scientist who specializes in insects , and also in theories pertaining to a certain psychopath who may or may not be killing people in the dead of night - when young Jennifer is out sleepwalking ! She's deemed crazy and meant to be taken to a mental hospital , but she has other plans up her sleeve , or up swarming in the air . There's a confident , fresh Connelly in the lead , as well as Pleasance who's always dependable as the prophetic veteran of this ilk ( once or twice you wonder if he'll say " I shot him six times ! " ) But it's what Argento puts his young lady through that makes or breaks Phenomena for the viewer . As with other films of his " classic " era like Opera and Suspiria , he doesn't tether himself to logic ; it would only get in the way of his big ideas and abstractions , his visual of Jennifer looking down that white hallway , the little fly buzzing along with her , and of course the eventual lair of the killer . That lair , I should add , is the kind of place that , as Argento directs it , gets scarier as it goes along . Not the kind of scary where you always go BUMP in the night , but more where you suddenly get in a frame of mind , where the psychopath has the audience in a grip much like Jennifer . It's interesting to note a common stylistic trait we see here , which is a cliché to be sure , with the killer's POV as something characteristic of the material . It should be a big gag , but for Argento it's all part of the game he's weaving . While there aren't as many random things that happen as in Opera , and we don't get any kind of ' deep ' murder mystery as in Deep Red , it's never too misleading . By the time Argento plunges us into that pit with the maggots we're squirming in our seats , and feeling an edge of exhilaration to wonder how the hell she ( or another chap who happens to be in the room ) will get out alive . But as if to seal the deal on making this a near-classic horror film , Argento does a crazy double-twist , one that had me raising eyebrows , laughing uncontrollably , and with a feeling that , as twisted as it's become , justice has been served . Even with the ( cool ) metal music not in cue to the scenes most of the time when they pop up ( the Goblin music fares much better ) , and even with the lapses in judgment or the occasional poor acting turn , Phenomena should be something of a must-see for die-hards of Italian giallo , or just anyone wanting something a tinge ' different ' in their slasher movie . And what makes a difference more than insects !
about as raw as rock concert / docs get , a magnificent time capsule	Metallica in 1986 got perpetually shattered when bassist Cliff Burton died one of the more tragic and unexpected deaths in rock history . In the interim of finding a new bass player , they compiled together this very rough , raw collection of performances , back stage footage , screwing around footage , drunken bits , and just random shots of them doing stuff . It's amateurishly shot , but in the very 80s metal way that Metallica was then it's a kind of charmingly amateurish way . Sometimes the quality ranges from song to song , with some stretches being a little better than others ( the first two songs are the rougher ones , with someone in the nose bleed section with one zoom in and out camera ) . Best is seeing the group play in Germany - where there are multiple cameras used - and songs like ' Fade to Black ' and ' Seek and Destroy ' get very good treatments to tremendous live performances of each . There are also memorable turns of ' Whiplash ' ( my personal favorite from Kill Em All with a much better than average bass solo by Cliff ) , and ' Creeping Death ' , and one of their very best ' Welcome ( Sanitarium ) ' , even with just one cam and deteriorating sound / picture quality it , for lack of a better term for this review , rules . The behind the scenes footage is also worth it for any collector or just casual fan , as you see more-than-rare TV interviews , and even the group in their pre-Kill ' Em All time with Dave Mustaine ( he also performs on Whiplash in another ultra rare appearance ) . It's sometimes funny , crude , f-off-ish , but they're always realer and far less stuck up and estranged as in the recent Some Kind of Monster . This is a band at the real peak of their powers , and the musicianship is tight as can be even as Hammet or Burton brash through their solos like their on their way to the electric chair . Sometimes the off-kilter quality of the filming does get in the way - especially when someone's head gets in the way of the camera - but it's not as often as might be expected . It's un-polished but very memorable , and should be apart of any serious fan of metal ; as it is there is quite the lot that have a dis-liking to Metallica of the post-Black album ( or even Black album on ) , to which this is like the perfect shot of Kill em All through Master of Puppets live memorabilia . As much a fitting tribute as it is a pretty good video in its own right .
a cheerfully ironic and devilishly self-indulgent plunge into the spirit of Bob Fosse	I should be inclined to say that All That Jazz is much too full of itself to really pull off as an entertaining comedy-musical . But then again , the whole tone of Fosse's " semi " autobiographical splurge , less so much a typical film , is to comment on self-indulgence in movies , while at the same time embracing it , going all out with crazy musical numbers involving rehearsed airline erotica and two Joe Gideons with one within-a-movie directing the other laid up on a hospital bed . But what does make it a deep work , as did Fellini's 8 , which Fosse obviously loves to the point of hiring the spectacular Giuseppe Rotuno to do the cinematography , is that it laments the end of life by celebrating the enjoyable mania and despair of its protagonist . Although Fosse can't totally compare to the penultimate film about the creative crisis of an artist ( the angel of death scenes are hit or miss , depending on the context , and unlike Mastroianni there seems to be too much forced on Scheider to be almost exactly like Fosse , at least in myth , with the cigarettes and pills and women ) , he does make it often exhilarating cinema , and hilarious cinema with the touch of someone who is cynical but not afraid of speaking the truth , about talent , creativity , love , and just plain living . Never has being and nothingness been portrayed with choreography so extravagant ( if that makes sense ) ! The premise is actually very simple , as most musicals should be : Gideon is preparing his latest musical of free-wheeling sex and luridly fun ( we're never too sure what it's " about " as he zones out completely during a script reading ) , and editing a film on the side , while also dealing with his many women on the side sometimes meeting one another in the bedroom , and his daughter , the one pure fountain of innocence who may be catching some of Gideon's attitude . But the stress , and pressure , of being on top of his game all the time knocks him out - on top of the usual barbiturates for fed up artists , leads him to the hospital with horrible heart problems , of which he doesn't take too seriously , even when he's on his last breath . Fosse turns tragedy into self-reflexive entertainment on a self-consciously buoyant scale ; I can only think of Singin ' in the Rain as another musical that is as explicitly fun - if not as dirty and outlandish - at portraying serious subject matter . Fosse aims maybe too high , if that's the only problem , particularly with a final musical number that is catchy as hell ( and how could it not , shuffling off the mortal coil ) , if maybe TOO catchy , if that's possible . However this isn't something that becomes a deterrent , on the contrary it's like watching some acrobat out of a dingy Bronx hell-hole who puts on quite a show on the high-wire . Certain musical numbers will forever remain my all-time favorites , chiefly the ' rehersal ' performance that Gideon puts on for the producers to see of a highly erotic number called " Take Off With Us " , proclaimed approximately by his ex-wife to be " the best thing you've ever done . . . you son of a b " . Then there's the hospital-bed number , where deep-rooted psychological angst not only gets some up-beat razzle dazzle , but even a wink and a nod to Fosse's directorial style , ( " you missed your line " ) . While the sub-plots put in place , namely with heel John Lithgow and the budget problems of the musical production , don't serve much of a purpose aside from slightly interesting fodder , leading only up to whatever great little moment , little weak or totally cool gesture Gideon may make , even when he's hooked up to a breathing machine . At the end of it all , what makes All That Jazz sensational movie-making is the combination of strong subject matter , of the flawed brilliance of a man such as Gideon - via Fosse himself - with a completely assured hand of style . The dancing is terrific , the camera movements are always apart of the action itself ( Rotuno gets the frame almost to dance with the others ) , and Scheider is particularly great . Following the lead from a certain TV ' critic ' , I give it three and a half out of four balloons !
into the methods and mind and soul of Tarkovsky	It's of the utmost value for anyone interested in film-making - those who just love watching how they're made or want to be / are filmmakers - to see this documentary , which chronicles the making of Tarkovsky's last film , the Sacrifice , as well as peers into the personal dimensions of him as an artist . If only for one section is the film a must-see ; it's staggering to see the horror and triumph of the climactic house burning scene in the Sacrifice , how all the elements came together , crumbled , and then they went back and did it all over again . It's a moral lesson , in a sense , for the filmmaker , and a kind of primary example of what it is to dedicate oneself to the technical preference . If Tarkovsky had filmed the scene today he would've had the option of digital , without the possibility ( as it turns out here ) of the film jamming in the camera . But then this is only one piece of the concern over the sequence : all the elements , the special effects , the blaze of the fire , the movement of the camera , the actors hitting their marks precisely as if this were all on the theater stage , have to come together in one fell swoop . And being Tarkovsky , you know the intensity involved . But then this is just one part of what is already an impressive example of a director profile . We see his thoughts and philosophies expounded upon about making his cinema one of total and utter personal expression , about dealing with the actors , the scrupulous attention to detail which he pretty much all oversees from the color of dresses to the shape of a couch . And , after a while , we see why he's comparable himself to the filmmakers he mentions ( i . e . Bresson , Bergman , Bunuel , Kurosawa ) who all create their own kinds of ' worlds ' in the movies they make , as opposed to just imitating a reality . He almost appears to come too close to being in a personal realm of expression , like some painter or poet who can't get out of his own head-space with the thoughts he has , the dreams he remembers , and the visions that are brought on by certain feelings in memories . But then he also has it in him to strive for tapping into the audience without being very obvious . If there is manipulation to his art , it is in no way of conventional commercial means . Which means , of course , Tarkovsky isn't for everyone ( some of his long takes can last about the length of an infomercial ) . But if you're interested in knowing more about the iconoclast director behind Stalker and Solaris and the Sacrifice ( not to forget Andrei Rublev ) , then you're more than likely already a fan , or have some interest in a personal Russian cinema . And as we see with him on the set with the Sacrifice , and the control he has along with the method of concise collaboration , it's no wonder his sister ( I think it's his sister ) comments that he , at the time he was alive , had freedom than any other filmmaker from his native country . Directed by Andrei Tarkovsky is an insightful peek into this late , great film / poet / scholar / dreamer / et all .
smart , sharp , cutting edge , and a big middle finger to the establishment , now as then	When someone refers to the independent cinema realm in the United States it's often inferred that it means the filmmaker or people behind the project had much more creative freedom and did what they wanted . This , today , is not really always the case unless someone is a solid " auteur " and creative freedom still comes with the caveat that one has to find distribution with one of the independent divisions of major studios or by getting picked up somehow for some kind of low-level deal at a worthwhile film festival . But Putney Swope , Robert Downey Sr's film about a tough-as-nails African-American accidentally promoted to head advertising guru at a production company , is independent cinema , the kind of work that went right along with the likes or Romero's Night of the Living Dead and Cassavetes Faces at the same time of getting no real typical studio distribution but causing waves , kicking ass and taking names in the cinema world . For all its moments that are rough and crude , it's unforgettable . It's also a film that is funny , very and excruciatingly funny . Sometimes the sense of humor is just so ridiculous it's nearly impossible not to laugh , from the mere appearance of the President Mimeo with his wife to lines of dialog from the advertisements Swope's team puts together like " I can't eat an air conditioner " in a real " soul " voice . It is as smart as the audience it is aiming at , which is anyone with two brain cells to put together who can see that this work isn't offensive or too shocking because it's meant to rattle the cage , and it does this pretty well in the first five minutes . Once that's past Downey Sr goes on his blitz of sorts as far as being a filmmaker with nothing to lose : his protagonist is part Fidel Castro , part Isaac Hayes circa 1972 ( and yes it's 1969 in the film ) and part hard-assed ad exec with a firing streak to make Mr . Spacely on the Jetsons look kind . And don't forget those side character , dear God . There's so many memorable lines and moments , from maybe the most hilarious botched assassination attempt in any movie to the one ad for " Face-Off " skin cream that includes lines that would give South Park a run for its dirty-mouth money , to just little asides with the one guy from Jack Hill's movies playing the Muslim who keeps giving lip to Swope and that one boy with the the nun who curses up a storm and impresses Swope in a swift stroke , that it's hard to keep track . It's a pretty direct message about media and advertising , but there's also a lot of powerful moments where it just hits the nail on the head about racism in America , sometimes without having to do more than a gesture and sometimes with doing something HUGE like having black panther types going this way and that around Swope's advertising regime . And for a low-budget production ( I mean super low , hence the comparison to Night of the Living Dead and Faces ) Downey got some really good actors , all non-union , and it's hard to imagine that some of them might have had their first time on camera here . It should be mentioned that Downey's style doesn't make it perfect : it is crude and sometimes too crazy and dated for its own good , and I'm sure I didn't get some of the underlying humor of a couple of the ads since I'm from a full generation after these ads were aired ( albeit the " Miss Redneck Jersey " was definitely not lost on me ) . In general though this is one of the finest of its time period , a satire that stings and a feature with a predominantly black cast that is all too knowing of what comes from an excess of power , regardless of skin color . It is , as someone might say , " good s . "
One of Scott's best films , but not quite on my top 10 list for 2001	Ridley Scott seems to have a knack for high intensity in movie-making ( Gladiator , Blade Runner , Hannibal and Thelma and Louise among others come to mind ) and Black Hawk Down , a war picture set in Somalia , is another prime example of his knack . Black Hawk Down is a war movie that does something I haven't seen much ( or dare I say haven't seen at all ) which is not going directly into the battle scenes , but instead keeping the audience in check with how the soldiers are reacting and feeling and never diverging much from the action . It is a daring move by Scott . In " Down " , a somewhat large group of soldiers are sent to the heart ( or mindless brain ) of Somalia to capture 2 lieutenants in regard to a civil war going on in the country that has taken 300 , 000 lives ( " it's not war , it's genocide " comments the major general played by Sam Shepard ) . At first notice it seems like they can get in and out of the mission in a few hours . . . but then everything goes wrong . The Somalians start a near unstoppable attack on the U . S . soldiers , shooting as many as they can and sneaking out from roofs and sides like cockroaches . It becomes a chaotic day and night for the soldiers as they try to stay alive while waiting for extra troops to come in to rescue them that could take time to get there . Outside of the couple of flaws in the film ( at the end it tells that 18 U . S . soldiers died in the attack but if you don't keep exact track it will seem more / the cinematography is alright however the editing cuts too much in the action and tension ) , Black Hawk Down is quite the war picture , one that will be memorable in years to come as the most accurate depiction of what went on with us in Somalia in 1993 . Kudos to Scott and the cast ; Ewan McGregor gets the highest praise from me if only for giving an amazing American accent .
might be the greatest power-point presentation put on film this decade	And I say that opening summary line in saying that , perhaps , this isn't a perfect film . Al Gore , the would-be SHOULD be president ( political views aside for now aside from that bit ) , tells some bits from his own stories here and there in the film as cut-aways from his slide-show presentation to his audience , and the bits are almost very interesting . Here and there these bits are even heartbreaking ( seeing the replay of the 00 election , but also the story around his son's hospitalization ) . That they detract from the main trajectory of what the film is about is , I guess , just a way for the director to make it feel like a full movie . But that observation , if not outright criticism , aside this is one of those must-see movies if you care about , well , life really . While the film is not without putting some background on Gore and moments of his politics , 99 % of the time he is really just a person relaying what is lacking in not just films and television but from other media sources - empirically backed facts that can only help and provide a basically ' scholarly ' foundation for this case . And this case is not , of course , a bi-partisan kind of effort in spite of what some politicians and sadly uninformed skeptics would try to say . For those who may follow and believe already that , for example , the world is only 6000 years old and there were dinosaurs alongside us like in the Flintstones might be harder to convince on the outset anyway . But because the problem goes across party lines , and oceans , and mountains and glaciers , even over the poles , it does deserve attention on this medium . The main thrust behind Gore's global warming argument is presented in what would be basically just a power-point presentation , one of those where a click sends up the next image to get some contextualization . But the actual presentation itself is brilliantly put together to flow very well . It even starts with something very amusing with a cartoon from the Matt Groening world ( whether its from Simpsons or Futurama I can't say ) . The context is mainly based on how global warming affects Co2 , the oceans , the countless glaciers in the world , and how hurricanes , tornadoes and typhoons are all apart of this big ecological f-up that could send the civilization to a stand-still within 100 years . I knew at least some things about what Gore was presenting , but the amount of facts that keeps piling as staggering as this is what sells the content completely . Sure , Gore is a politician , and who is to trust him any more than the average shlub ? It's more than what he might stand for , even as he does present himself as well as he ever has on screen . The information here is bigger than he and us as viewers really are . And for anyone walking around in the Northern hemisphere surrounded by at least one of the catastrophes mentioned linked to global warming An Inconvinient Truth is a big zap of what could have come just as well from a scientist , and has , many times over ( i . e . one big fact that interested me was that out of over 900 studies on the issue not one says that it is not from a human cause ) . Along with some of this shock of reality Gore does try to provide some hope with what can be done by people to stop at least some of what is going on . In a sense the real strength of the film is like in the strength of an academic research paper - an extraordinary one - where what can be proved is just as important if not more so than the results . That the film-making style that corresponds this is good in this corresponding slide-show way ( and inventive here and there within a documentary aspect ) is impressive . So run , don't drive ( heh ) , to see this movie .
delightful in its frank and playful attitude to " Him " vs / with " Her "	Jean-Luc Godard must have known he would come back to Charlotte and Her Jules very soon after making it , since he recreated in Breathless , made at or around the same time as this last short he made before going head-on into features , a nearly 20 minute version of this scene only with a little more of an equal playing field . Meaning in this case it's all about the man , or rather " her " man , and in a small-term experimental sense it's quite successful . It's basically just a monologue Jean Paul Belmondo delivers to his girl following her return from being with " another " man , who apparently is waiting in his car on the street below . The monologue is so ranty Charlotte ( who as a clever and sneaky and telling trick by Godard gets top billing ) only gets in two lines , one of them her exit , " I just came for my toothbrush " , with all smiles going on , trying on a hat , occasionally whistling , while her man goes on and on . It was one of Godard's so often quoted idioms that it became cliché and then went back around to original and then in a circle forever and ever that " the history of cinema is men photographing women . " It is in this case that Godard practices this full-tilt ; while Belmondo ( with Godard dubbing ) gets all of the audio time , pontificating , complaining , praising , sarcastically reminiscing about the good times and bad times and harping both poetic and the self-conscious about himself and her , the camera is almost always on the pretty Anne Collette . Godard would return to usually keeping his camera on his " lady " be she Anna Karina , Bridgit Bardot or Anne Wiezemsky , but for right now it's perhaps best to consider this a practice run . Thankfully it's an extremely entertaining and curiously rigorous practice run , showcasing the attention to the opposite sexes plus flexing such muscles as breezy and quick cuts and the freedom and rough edges of a hand-held black and white camera . Ah , those were the days , before say the 1980s and 1990s came around .
maybe the quintessential Hicks special , albeit hard to find complete	Apparently the DVD version of Bill Hicks's comedy special Relentless - filmed from the Montreal comedy special where he finally broke out as a stand-up star - is not quite complete . It runs an hour , and is missing some footage . Luckily , there's enough that remains , and in mostly good enough condition , to suffice calling it an exceptional effort . With maybe one or two little moments where he lags , this is some of Hicks ' most flawless work , as usual ranging from cigarette / non-cigarette fatalities , supporting the war but not the troops , playing music backwards ( " You're Satan ! " ) , BJ's , and of course drugs . Every bit is stinging with some kind of savagery , witty and with the right targets but never too mean ( well , unless you're New Kids on the Block ) , and even giving a jab at Canadians as it is , of course , Montreal . But the delivery , too , comes sometimes out of left field , a little calm and subtle but with a kind of right sucker-punch that manages to really work the crowd well ; just wait till he gets to the stuff about Alabama and you'll start rolling on the floor . It's brilliant stuff .
a probing mind-game played out on shattering tones , with more than a touch Polanski	Roman Polanski was the correct person to direct this film , based on ( and looking very much like it was ) a three-character play set in a confined house , because he understands how to make his mark with notice but care with the camera , and for skill at holding firm on the guessing games without interference . He has here a strong script already , but little touches seem to still be his handiwork all the same ; the opening itself leaves a lot of room for interpretation as to what this film will be as it's just classical musicians playing Schubert . Then little movements of the camera , the glances and timing , it's all appearing as if it's Polanski updated for the 90s with a slightly wound edge of political subversion on the edges . But , again , it's more for his style and choice of actors that makes this such a qualified success as such a " talky " psychological thriller . Talky , by the way , as just a euphemism for it being very complex in what has to be monologues , grandstanding , over-long deception , the moments of someone trying to weasel out or get out of something that needs to be shown in this case . It's clever work of dramatic maneuvering of siding on one or the other on not just a moral issue , but on the very idea of it being extremely , crushingly human . As said , the actors are a huge factor to Death and the Maiden working as well as it does with characters that teeter on madness , truth , and the power of revenge . All actors are in top form , really , as Weaver has that ultra very tough self that one's seen in many action / science fiction movies , and at the same time taps into sadness , irony , and cold moments of anger that goes past the usual model in a contemporary play . She's out for vengeance against a man she finds is somehow connected to her lawyer husband , that she was raped by this man while trapped and tortured for days randomly . Kingsley plays the accused , who spends a lot of the movie tied to a chair pleading with innocence in an everyman quality that is ultimately a deception unto itself ; he's so proficient at playing good people that it's usually hard to see him as more crooked underneath than he is , and the little moments , however slight , that give him away . Stuart Wilson also has his sparks of interest as the doubting and most reason-minded of the three , and keeps it bound to being so logical that he keeps balance but is also a possible tipping scale , a feat that Wilson rises up to as also a sympathetic actor . Occasionally the script gets weighed with tiny fragments that aren't totally necessary ( the revelation of Gerardo's infidelity at a point in the story that already has enough emotional baggage riding on should have been tossed aside by the usually economically minded storyteller Polanski ) . But they're not many , and overall the sensibility in Death and the Maiden is a combination of actor ferocity and a wise use of events and attitude leaning towards multiple levels of interpretation , with slices of Polanski's sick sense of humor thrown in ( eg the sudden burst of heavy metal music as the electricity comes back on and the ' kidnapee ' tries to escape ) . The end itself is entirely plausible simply because of Kingsley being so easy ( however not easy outside of the surface appearance ) in playing the reversal , and the final decision that brings rhyme to reason . It is , in essence , appropriate .
like a brilliant four-part episode from the series ; lots of personal wounds revealed , and the Joker to boot !	Batman : Mask of the Phantasm stands on its own feet extremely well , when at least compared to some of the lessor Batman animated movies ( Batman vs Dracula anyone ? ) , and packs a good punch for fans so many years later . The original series was in its own other region - taking what more stories from the comics ( if not overall style and atmosphere like Burton or Nolan ) - and was able to cover some fine ground with our troubled hero the Dark Knight . This story tells of a character , not ever quite named but called here as ' Phantasm ' , who is killing off some of the high-rolling gangsters in town . Meanwhile , Bruce Wayne meets an old love of his , Andrea , and old wounds are opened over a brief and untimely ended engagement . And then there's also Andrea's father , who . . . OK , not much to try and spoil here , lets just say at some point the Joker gets involved , and everything jets into a ' laughing matter ' . Even as it was meant originally for TV , the directors Radomski and Timm , through their writer collaborators , have applied a drawing style that is distinctive amongst other cartoons of its ilk from the period : very direct lines and sharp , jagged edges , lots of smoke at ( specific ) times , the right blend of noir when it comes to revealing the caped crusader when he enters a room in the dead of night . In a sense they're stylists as are the ( good ) directors of the franchise live-action films . Only here there's a catch : the running time is short ( originally the filmmakers thought it would be meant for TV before WB changed their minds ) , so there's only so much time to dig into the dilemma Wayne is caught in in the movie , where his identity is being cross-checked all over as the killer of the gangsters , and then the personal connection with Andrea and her father . Its some fairly significant probing into the character , if not the deepest there's ever been . But also , aside from the slightly darker impulses , Mask of the Phantasm is a lot of fun , even up to a point if you didn't watch the series much . Just seeing Hammil ham it up as the Joker is a blast , even though he doesn't appear ( almost , one might think , as a lark ) until halfway through the movie ! But he ( via the filmmakers trying their best to give fans the best of the animated basics ) supplies a hugely entertaining climax , one which involves a big fight among an immense diorama of Gotham City , rigged with explosives !
a pretzel factory of a thriller ; convoluted but compulsively watchable	It's easy to see how it can be done , but only so often do we get some good ' knock-offs ' of Hitchcock films . Sometimes we get outright homages like with Brian De Palma , or we get cheap rip-offs that some of us never see unless digging deep into the thriller bin at Blockbuster . Luckily , the French seem to have it licked , and in this case director Guillaume Canet takes Harlan Coben's pot-boiler and makes it into riveting if not quite linear film-making . You have to stay with the picture as it goes along - at times you may get so confused you'll want to give up - but if you can give yourself just a bit to the twists and paranoia , it's very rewarding . It's in very simple terms about Alex ( Dustin Hoffman look-alike François Cluzet ) and his wife Margot ( stunning-looking Marie-Josee Croze ) , who one night go skinny dipping and . . . no , not one of ' those ' movies ( slasher ) . But murder is involved , and we're made to believe Margot was killed and Alex was knocked unconscious that night . Then the story jumps ahead eight years later , when Dr . Alex Beck is now living alone and still sort of mourning his wife as the anniversary of her death comes around . And yet , even as the case seemed to be closed , the police still have suspicions about Alex since he doesn't remember how he got out of the water onto the dock before being knocked out . Another two bodies are found buried near the original murder site , and the case is reopened , with Alex now once again a suspect . Then something else happens . . . I don't want to mention much else , for fear of spoiling the daylights ( or just boring the hell out of you with exposition ) , but suffice to say it becomes a mix of elements from the likes of Fugitive , Vertigo ( yes , Vertigo , at least one element anyway ) , and several of Hitchcock's " wrong man on the run " movies . There are things that the director does to keep things moving and fast-paced for fans of real hardcore thrillers ( a chase midway through the film might just top Fugitive for sheer audacious move on the part of the hero ) , but he also makes the audience pay attention very closely to details . Just a subtle close-up of a computer screen with a ' new email ' , or a moment with Alex's dog , or even a U2 song . And it's crucial to keep up with small scenes that shouldn't seem like they mean much ; the director understands all of the components of a warped mystery where characters and motives and even simple twists in a single bound are not what they seem . Luckily , there is time in the last section of the story where a certain character ( I won't say who but it's an older one ) who can expound on the exposition that thankfully puts most of the pieces of the story into place . But then even after things are explained , it gets one talking about what's just happened , if everything made sense , and not in that " damn that was no good , too confusing " way . It doesn't underestimate the audience's intelligence or manner to keep up with a story that involves murder , love , lust , cover-ups , power-plays , old rich French guys , and and even a sliver of social commentary at one point . And the cast is uniformly terrific ; saying that Clement is like Dustin Hoffman isn't just as comparison in looks , as he's really got the stuff to lead this film as someone you want to stick with 100 % ( if not the Cary Grant type , then certainly Jimmy Stewart ) ; Cruze , for her moments on screen , is gorgeous and sad and happy and all those things that make up a mysterious character ; Kristen Scott Thomas - yes , Kristin Scott Thomas speaks French - is amazing for her time as a supporting character . And don't get me started on the guy who played Margot's father . It's a work of minor brilliance that , unfortunately , loses its footing in the last couple of minutes with a sentimental coda . For the most part , Tell No One is what we want to see often in American movies , but usually people aren't strong enough to just put it out there without mucking up the style . Canet is a strong director , great with a lost-in-a-pretzel-factory story , and it takes its place alongside the likes of With a Friend Like Harry , Red Lights and The Beat That My Heart Skipped as one of the superlative neo-noirs of 21st century French cinema . Sleeper-tastic !
the funniest work of Kline's career ; a big bang of ultra hilarity and over-the-top jokes of visual and wit variety	A Fish Called Wanda comes from director Charles Crichton , though much of what makes the film a success is that he just doesn't get in the way of what these actors can do and , more importantly , the material . It's John Cleese as writer and him and Michael Palin as co-stars , so immediately ( and especially for me as I saw it as part of a retrospective involving the group ) Monty Python comes to mind . It is and it isn't like Python , as this time it does tell really a full-on story without it being too sketchy - ' too ' being a loose word here , most particular exceptions being Palin's scenes after the old lady - and it's all really about the wacky surprises and behavior of these characters . It's also the Oscar winning performance of Kevin Kline's career , and possibly still one of the very best that he's ever pulled off . It's shameless at being stupid , which his Otto as a running gag replies " don't call me stupid " , and also at trying to seem intelligent in his dastardly gangster ways , while supplanting himself with Nietzsche and jealousy around his tease / seeming-to-others sibling Wanda played by Jamie Lee Curtis . It's fearless comedy at it's best , and it's quite possible out of all the good things going for A Fish Called Wanda he's overall the funniest , almost without trying ( just seeing his face as he pops up during the rendezvous Curtis and Cleese have is worth the price to check it out ) . But aside from him the picture works as being a rip-roaring comedy , so to speak , as the comedy ranges from more exaggerated forms of comedy around for ages ( i . e . there's someone in the house that shouldn't be , hides , wackiness ) , to being more explicit ( Cleese's Arch strips down for his beau , only to have the people who once had real estate dealings with him see him right then and there ) , to being almost sadistic ( dead dogs the biggest ) . But there's also room for stuttering , here in the form of Palin's Ken , who is 2nd only to Kline in the big laughs department , as he ultimately ends up missing the dogs he wipes out more than the old lady does herself . His may be a kind of running gag that could wear out its welcome , and in maybe one or two scenes the laughs aren't totally mined , but he also provides some of the funniest scenes , like with Kline , I may have ever seen , like when Arch comes in to ask Ken where the jewels are , and the stutter goes on and on and on ( or , for that matter , when he gets ' cured ' ) . It also helps that Curtis and Cleese's characters , while often seeming like the ' straight ' characters in the film , are also extremely gifted at doing their forms of comedy , and Cleese ends up pulling some unexpected comedic bits the likes of which match up to those of his Python days . His character at first seems fairly bland , an attorney defending a jewel thief ( I forget the actor's name ) , who gets taken in romantically by a ' law student ' , Wanda , whom he doesn't want to get involved with as she is , of course , a witness for the defense in the case . But in the midst of playing him up to get info , it becomes for both actors something to keep up with Kline's own comedy stylings , his facial expressions and manner of speaking ( not just the Italian , of course a highlight ) . He puts up a well-measured performance alongside all the others , and altogether the main four actors pull off something of an amazing feat ; it has the pure irreverence of Python , the go-for-broke silliness done with a slightly more dirty and almost obscene beat , while even having a conventional side to it too with the heist plot . And it makes for a great time if you happen to get to see it in a packed audience .
Scorsese evolves into a " Hollywood " director ; Burstyn is fantastic	Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore at times might not look it to those who don't check ( or care to check ) the director credit , but Martin Scorsese - in the interim between Mean Streets and Taxi Driver - took on a film where he could prove to his detractors wrong . Indeed , Scorsese can direct anyone well , man , woman , child ( just look at Kundun if you don't believe his knack for directing non-professional along with pros , besides the point ) . In this story , Ellen Burstyn plays the title character , left abandoned with her son after her husband dies . She has to make ends meet as a waitress in Phoenix in order to make her dream for her and her son come true - getting to Monterey . Enter in that cool presence that is Kris Kristofferson , and the film goes into not-so-conventional territory ( some would argue up till the end ) . For acting students , this is one of those kinds of films one has to check out - Burstyn , in her Oscar winning role , plays between kind , angry , frightened , scared , and strong in her role , trying to break past other female types that had been around in films at the time . There is also ample room for a small role for Harvey Keitel , as a smooth talker with a bad temper . Scenes between the two of them are like method acting staples of 70's movie-making ( not to downplay Kristofferson or Diane Ladd's performances either ) . And then there's Scorsese , injecting his style sometimes without much of a trace , and sometimes so forcefully that one who knows his work well can sit up and take notice . The improvisation he lets the actors have in scenes is so delicate and precise that it adds to the reality - or the illusions - of most scenes . There is also a very funny ( in a weird way ) beginning to the film as a parody of farm-girl good times goes on . A recommended treat - those who are die-hards for the Scorsese crime films may be perplexed , but for the Lifetime TV crowd who usually wouldn't go near a Scorsese film at the video store will likely be more pleased than I was ( or maybe not - this film has as much detractors as defenders for its feminist themes ) .
crazy , random , absurd , surreal , tangential , dumb . . . genius	I never watched Space Ghost when it used to air , probably because I literally didn't know what I was missing ( why I didn't watch it I can't remember , maybe it was on too late or it just seemed like the guests were sometimes unknowns to me , even as this wasn't the case at all ) . Now on DVD , I was curious to see it as part of other old shows from Cartoon Network . Seeing it now , it's . . . everything that's fun and smart in a really throwaway-joke kind of way in a cartoon when taking itself perfectly un-seriously . It's a spoof on old 60s cartoons , late night talk shows , hubris , rivalries , and many other things . Space Ghost and Zorak make for a great duo , with the other guy ( can't remember his name now , the masked ' director ' who sometimes sings if forced to in Zorak's absence ) a notable third wheel , even as they're often ready to rip at each other's throats . The comedy is brilliant without even really trying , though I'm sure the writers worked their heads off to get certain scenes down ( other times . . . you can tell they just chucked stuff at the wall , and I mean that as a compliment oddly enough ) . The writing basically makes up for the obvious goof-factor of the animation , which is repetitive and might just be ripped off of the 60s Space Ghost show ( where else will I hear a line like " You smell like a farm ! " ) , and it's probably one of the best ludicrous-type programs the Cartoon Network ever had . It's only my loss I didn't track down this crazy piece of work sooner , or watch it when it originally aired .
The Zucker's best . Nielson's best as well	ZAZ's ( David Zucker , Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker ) The Naked Gun is one of the funniest ( if not funniest ) film ever with more parodies and gags than one could ever imagine . And the writing is if not good , great that never lets up ( even through the finale baseball game with Reggie Jackson ) . But what really gets this film up there is it's main characters . Leslie Nielson has never been better and probably won ; t ever be this good ever again . He brings an insane type of humor from a cop that hasn't been seen since Clouseau . The supporting characters are good also , including Priscilla Pressley , George Kennedy , Ricardo Montebaum , Nancy Marchand and ( odd to see him in a movie today ) OJ Simpson . There zany characters and added with a great script make this a treasure in cinema comedy . One of the best films of the 80's .
One of the Best films of 1995	Casino shows that even with a re-visited GoodFellas ( in Las Vegas ) can still be well done when a Duo suck as Martin Scorsese and Nicholas Pileggi does it right . With great performances by 3 time teamed up Robert De Niro and Joe pesci and also by Sharon Stone , this film is for people who are fans of mob films , Scorsese fans , or just plain old movie buffs .
Lady and the Tramp , before animation and at the start of talkies - one of the most wonderful films ever conceived and executed	If there is one Charlie Chaplin film to recommend , as others have pointed to in the past , City Lights is the one . Though Chaplin played his Tramp character superbly in other movies , like Modern Times and The Gold Rush , City Lights displays the Tramp at his funniest , his bravest , his most romantic , and his most sympathetic . It's tough for filmmakers in recent days to bring the audience so close emotionally with the characters , but it's pulled off . The film centers on three characters - the Tramp , the quintessential , funny homeless man who blends into the crowd , but gets caught in predicaments . He helps a drunken businessman ( Myers , a fine performance in his own right ) from suicide , and becomes his on and off again friend ( that is , when it suits him and doesn't notice his ' friend's ' state ) . The other person in the Tramp's life is the Blind Flower Girl ( Virginia Cherrill , one of the most absorbing , beautiful , and key female performances in silent film ) , who are quite fond of each other despite the lack of total perception . The emotional centerpiece comes in obtaining rent and eye surgery money , which leads to a ( how else can I put it ) magical boxing match where it's basically a 180 from the brutality and viscerality of a match in say Raging Bull . Though there is no dialog , the film achieves a timelessness - it's essentially a tale of two loners who find each other , lose each other , and find each other again ( the last scene , widely discussed by critics for decades , is moving if not tear-inducing ) . And it's never , ever boring - once you get along with the Tramp , you find the little things about him , the reaction shots , the little things he does after the usual big gag ( look to the ballroom scene for examples of this , or when he gets a bottle of wine poured down his pants without the other guy noticing ) . Truth be told , if this film makes you indifferent , never watch Chaplin again . But if you give yourself to the film , you may find it's one of the most charming from the era , or perhaps any era .
shows Tarkovsky's incredible control of direction for the most part ; surprisingly sharp Hemingway	Although I did like the 1946 adaptation of the Killers , I wasn't sure how a Russian , let alone someone who is usually much more into the visual prowess of things like Andrei Tarkovsky , would tackle Ernest Hemingway's brief , pulpy story of men on a mission and a man in hiding from those men . Turns out it's one of the best short films I've seen from a soon-to-be world renown European auteur , because of it's emphasis on the simplicity of suspense , of human action in desperate circumstances and how it's filmed with a mix of the noir style and with Tarkovsky's dependence on figures in curiously exciting compositions . He isn't alone on the film , however , as the middle scene at the apartment was directed by friend Alexander Gordon , with Tarkovsky directing the bigger chunks at the diner , and another guy Marika Beiku co-directing overall . Since the apartment scene is so short though , and accounts for just three shots , one being most elaborate as it goes in and out , tight and wide , on the morose Swede in hiding and his friend at the diner filling him in on what happened , it's mostly Tarkovsky's game here . Part of the skill , and curiosity , in how tense the long first scene at the diner is that music is completely absent , with the only tone coming from Tarkovsky himself as a whistling customer . Meanwhile , Tarkovsky uses Hemingway's dialog in a very realistic manner , even when he goes deliberate angles , like when George goes into the back with the sandwiches and we see his feet in the same tilted frame as an empty can on the floor , or with the usage of the mirror on the wall . There's also the suddenness of seeing a machine gun that strikes things up in the room , and just the general attitude of Al and Max , the hit men , as they keep calling George " bright boy " in a way that reminds me of the curious double-talk in a self-consciously bad-ass movie like Pulp Fiction ( not to mention the near casual usage of the ' N ' bomb ) . While it ends sort of on a screeching halt , the sense of ambiguity as to the fate of the Swede as well as everyone else in the diner who hid the secret is worthwhile for the material , as it's perfectly anti-climactic . It's not entirely a simple experiment , as it's too polished for that , but I couldn't see how it could be made any longer either . It's perfectly paced and acted nearly as well , and it's a fitting pre-cursor to the un-prolific but remarkable career of one of Russia's most important filmmakers .
beat for beat , second for second , the funniest parody I've seen in years	" . . . and remember it doesn't say Cox , unless I say it tastes like Cox . " This is an example of prime send-up , a parody that lovingly references everything in rock-music-bio-pics , from ( the obvious centerpiece ) Walk the Line , Ray , Don't Look Back , Elvis flicks , The Doors , and countless others , including a mention to Yellow Submarine and the eras of Motown , rockabilly , even punk ( yes , more than a decade before there is punk a version of Walk Hard is played ) . Kasdan and Apatow get what it is to do a send up , which is to be knowing of all the conventions , clichés , and formulas that end up coming out of what are , actually , real-life stories already put into a simple context . It follows the tradition of the ZAZ team ( Airplane and Naked Gun ) by delivering a joke or gag or just something weird every other second , and it builds up into one of the funniest movies in years . A friend of mine said recently that it takes someone to actually really like and admire what they're spoofing in order for it to be pulled off . This helps , of course , as one can tell that Mel Brooks had a love for the theater and musicals for The Producers and horror movies with Frankenstein , and more recently Edgar Wright with action flicks and Hot Fuzz . But there's another component , I think , that separates a film like Walk Hard from the recent slew of " Movies " ( Date , Epic , the upcoming Meet the Spartans ) is that the people working on Walk Hard are some of the funniest people working in Hollywood today , and knowing what makes fresh , vulgar send-up work . It's not simply about mashing up pop-culture references to make them stick , there has to be just something that clicks through the writing and acting . Walk Hard has that in spades - from the opening jokes ( yes jokes , and they're running ones ) about Dewey slicing his brother in half with a machete ( with the brother still giving words of advice cut in half , and leading up to the also running gag " The wrong kid died ! " line ) , going into playing the blues as a little white kid , to being 14 ( and played by Reilly , of course ) marrying a 12 year old fan , to the sudden bolts of inspiration for songs in the middle of a scene - not to mention the lyrics - it's already apparent this will be good stuff . But then there's more : Hasidim music agents with names like Kvetch L'Chaim ; drug scenes out of Ray " You don't want to do this ! " ; the ups and downs and the meetings with other famous stars ( " Hey , George Harrison " ) . I could go on and on about the little details as well , some of which are probably too much to even mention in this review . Suffice to say Reilly pops out of a shell that he's been in over the past decade or so . One of the superb character actors of his generation ( yes , I'm sounding like a pompously sounding critic for now ) , he's fantastic as Dewey Cox , giving him a sensibility that goes past simple parody - we actually end up feeling for this drug-addicted adulterer who goes in and out of rehab and finally settles in with his few dozen children of various mixed ethnicities ( the catching montage , by the way , is priceless ) . He gives the character that ' umph ' that even makes him more human than Leslie Nielson's Frank Drebin , and he creates so many absurd moments that it's easy to miss some of his subtle charms and dramatic touches . Just seeing him talk to a ghost Jonah Hill as " older ghost " brother Nate reveals his multi-faceted gifts . And like A Mighty Wind , Kasdan and Apatow and composer Michael Andrews make the songs legitimately good numbers amid some of the crudest innuendo in movie history ( songs go between ' innocent ' sexual acts to midgets and then to a huge orchestral number including countless tribes-people ) . Reilly also has the backup , acting-wise , of people from SNL ( Meadows and Parnell ) , The Office ( Fischer and Ed Helms ) and of course past Apatow works ( Rudd , Black , Long and Schwartzman give a movie-stealing scene as the Beatles in India ) . In the end , it's everything I love in a go-for-broke comedy that still sticks to the numerous predecessors it's imitating . And , if anything , it one-ups those movies as well as legitimate entertainment . So Walk Hard . . . Hard . . . to the movie theater !
one of the first foreign films I saw is still in my top 10 of all time	Federico Fellini is a genius of cinema , which many would attribute to this , La Dolce Vita , and many of his films of the 1950s . At the time I first saw this , I knew I was seeing something special , almost not of this planet , but I was also too young and not familiar with films in general to really appreciate it . After seeing it a few more times over the years , 8 remains one of those great films that I really experience more than watch , as the scenes and characters and outrageous humor and cool pathos and philosophy is all up for grabs for the senses . It's the kind of film , ironically from its subject matter , that inspires me to create once its over . Fellini tries his best here to get the audience in love with the language of cinema , if nothing else , and people will either go with it , find it amusing , or dismiss it altogether as pretensious , self-indulgent rubbish . It's got Marcello Mastroianni in one of his milestone performances as the perpetual artist / filmmaker in a creative , spiritual , and just overall crisis of wills . What will come of his next science fiction film , if it is eve one ? What about his past and how that may or may not affect not just the film or his life ? And the women , oh Lord the women ( the scene where he's surrounded by them in a dream-state is one of my very favorite scenes ever created with the chaos in fantasy and reality combined ) . True , it might be a little confusing at first , matter of fact sometimes things might just fly right by , hence not totally getting into it on the first time . But even on the first time that moment in the car , leading to him flying in the air , is about as indelible in the world of cinema as two fingers meet in a giant painted ceiling . Sometimes melodramatic ( or operatic , or carnival-like , or just bewildering and beautiful in equal measure ) , sometimes ludicrous , though always true to itself , it challenges its audience with something many people can relate to , not just creative people or artists or filmmakers even ( though for the latter it's definitely the landmark of movies about movies ) . I want to give this film a hug . . . actually , I'd rather whip it into submission while brandishing a cape and black hat to Wagner music .
Practically tailor-made for a film buff ( as well as for a viewer who watches occasionally ) , ' Dogs ' is a picture loaded to the brim with terrific visceral energy	Whenever the name Quentin Tarantino is mentioned nowadays , people treat him with the same reverence as Scorsese , De Palma , and other directors as such who have fiddled around with the crime / gangster genre to create personal , heavy-duty masterworks . However , at the time this film was first released , as was with his still best picture ' Pulp ' , he was regarded as a filmmaker who makes violent movies , filled with violence , chock full of violence , " too violent " ( if there ever could or should be such a thing in movies ) , etc . This is unfair . True , Tarantino writes and works his actors to such an intensity that the feelings that go with violent acts and violent tension is there , and true he shows the blood , he lets us hear the cries of agony and despair , and indeed there are times that bullets fired into people are shown as such right in frame . Yet he never exactly displays any truly violent acts ( he decided to leave the shot of Masden slicing the ear on the editing floor , unlike a director like David Lynch who gets right inside the matter ) - his technique is to evoke and strive for all of the emotions one would feel in such asituation , movie or in real life , to the most honest , near heart-wrenching limits , and thus to someone who may have even not even seen the film the images that appear in a trailer or on a video box bring the notion of this being an overly violent movie immediately . That the images we see throughout the film , bloody or not , stay with us long after the credits roll , is a testament to his dedication , and obvious trust , to his craft being as it is . The plot , while lifted from a Chow-Yun Fat film from the mid-eighties , is the first one to include his trademark non-linear storytelling design . Sure , this is not uncommon in most films , but since each scene has a meaty quality to it , with line after line of ( purposeful , to story as well as character ) dialog is spoken , you really don't know what to expect . A crime boss ( Lawrence Tierny ) assembles different criminals of different backgrounds , removes them of their given Christian names , and gives them pseudonym colors as the heist comes up . The robbery itself has a big hitch - cops are alerted sooner than thought , shoot-outs occur , some colors are wiped away , and the remaining assemble in the rendezvous to sort out what went wrong and who's to blame . For most films with such an ambitious and grounded script , nearly every performance is a crucial asset to the film's success , and Tarantino knows this in his bones , as well as in the casting of the right parts ( i . e . Steve Buscemi auditioned for Mr . White but got Mr . Pink , makes sense doesn't it ) : Keitel and Tierny are like old pros merely portraying old pros ; Roth has a true breakout performance as Orange ; Busemi himself proves why he's needed in film today ; Chris Penn makes for a fine supporting role ; Masden is one of the most convincing of the 90's psychos ; even Tarantino makes a perfect monologue for himself in the opener . Right away these actors give off the only impression they should - these are people that we can care about , despise , or watch in a lack of judgment as they float away in a flash - they've got to be human all the way . So , is Reservoir Dogs for everyone ? Not necessarily - children under the age of nine or ten , I'd suggest , should stay away even if they can understand and take the violence since it's really an film for maturer mindsets . But , for the passionate movie-goer , or for thrill seeking screen nuts , it's worth the ride . For one thing , I'll never think of " Stuck in the Middle With You " , or Steven Wright for that matter , the same way again . My opinion - Tarantino's 3rd best effort behind Pulp Fiction and From Dusk Till Dawn , and nearly superior over Jackie Brown .
One of the very best films of the year ; Bergman's last cinematic out-pouring is sublime	With Saraband , writer / filmmaker Ingmar Bergman closes the book , so to speak , on his life's work . It's a sequel , which could have been thwarting ( why go back and do the same thing over again , one could ask ) . But it is the kind of sequel that bears significance . Bergman brings back two actors / friends he's worked with numerous times , Liv Ullmann and Erland Josephson , and uses their characters from his film / TV series Scenes from a Marriage for a higher purpose than to rake in the bucks . He's out to bring some closure to their relationship , however not entirely based on nostalgia . This time two other characters in the film , new ones , become the centerpiece of the story . As with the majority of his works , he finds two key assets that work to his advantage behind his own personal attachment to the project - the camera / lighting , and the cast . It may be too easy to compare and contrast this film and the series . But it is of interest if only for curiosity sake . There is something of note that revealed to one how the actual cinematography can evolve properly or at least in a fashion that is not off-putting . This time around ( unlike Sven Nykvist's perfect work on ' Marriage ' , a kind of pre-Dogma 95 style to use the camera with the story ) , Bergman decided to make the film for television ( his on occasion work aside from theatre for the past twenty years since Fanny and Alexander ) and also decided to implement digital photography . There are five cinematographers , and it's too tedious to pick out if which one did what properly or who lit this right and so on . But that in Saraband , however , doesn't suffer by way of the digital perspective . If anything , it serves its purpose fully by keeping the naturalistic mood . Some scenes are seen with as clear an eye as ever for Bergman . Others that may be a little more obscured by darkness are affecting psychologically in a way . Bergman's preference is to look at faces and expressions , without much to obscure the actors . What is of surprise is that Bergman injects two things that he intentionally kept out of ' Scenes ' - inner visions ( actually shown , not just spoken and felt by the actors ) , and music . In at least a couple of scenes , to add an intensity and a sense of the surreal , we see what Karina sees in some key moments . She describes an ugly incident with her father . She runs through the woods . When something very ugly occurs , it happens off screen , with a pause given in-between one scream . Needless to say it was tremendously moving . The other involved an enormous , involving fantasy . She's just been told information by her grandfather Johan that is crucial for her decision towards the end . When she sits on the stairs , the camera suddenly cuts to pull back on her on a chair , against a white background , and the camera pulls back further and further at a quick pace . This kind of technique I could feel as if I've seen in maybe a dozen films . When Bergman does this , after such a hopeful scene for Karina , it is a useful technique . Whatever the intention , it's far greater a grab then in a standard action film . Those are the two kinds of scenes / images that are very emotional and immediate on a first viewing . Ullmann and Josephson , who portrayed Marianne and Johan thirty years ago , never lose their ability to play off each other as actors . The focal point this time is with Henrik and Karina though , so the performances by Ahlstedt and especially Dufvenius for Bergman had to be even more affecting than those of the observers . Ahlstedt's Henrik is a tricky sort to empathize with perhaps : can an audience be with him when the drama unfolds with his daughter ? Turns out he brings the humanity in all its darkness and seemingly complex inner-damnation as one of Bergman's most memorable characters . His conflicts with his father and daughter stem from a number of elements , but the key one is very identifiable - death of the one you've loved the most . How can change occur ? This is a question posed as well for Karina , and in Ahlstedt playing her she already shows enough talent and gusto to take on stronger roles in the future . At first sight , I thought she might have been over-hitting her mark , or that Bergman was over-directing . This was not the case , and in the subtle moments she revealed herself on the level of one of Bergman's ' ladies ' ( i . e . Ullmann , Bibi Andersson , and Harriet Anderson ) . As the closure , what does Bergman do ? He does something rather wise to weave the story of the father and daughter together with the continuing story of Johan and Marianne with an equal resonance and emotional weight . The younger two find their own ends to the means , and I would not dare reveal how and why . But for Marianne Bergman answers a question that was asked if not out-right then with all of the action and tension and buildups and payoffs in ' Marriage ' . Does a person know what emotion is , or what it feels like ? In the final scene ( to put it mildly ) , he and Ullmann answer it in an approach that practically had me in tears . This would not mark the first time this has happened while viewing a Bergman film , yet the fact that this is the last gave me a cleansing feeling , of the greatest cathartic release with a thoughtful film . If it's one of the key objectives for a filmmaker in drama and tragedy to reveal it as truthfully as possible , and bring us with the character ( s ) full-circle , Ingmar Bergman's pulled it off wonderfully . Saraband is one of the crucial swan songs in film history ( for my money , and will soon find its way to American theaters ( digital projectors more or less likely ) .
A unique look at addiction by Aronofsky / Selby ; it's the best DARE movie never made ( or would be made )	Mr . Aronofsky's Requiem for a dream definitely is unique - no other film I have seen on heroin and / or speed addiction has been filmed or acted like this . And it helps that I saw it again , because on a first viewing I looked more for the performances , and liked it , but didn't really regard the actual cinematic technique for it with as much un-equaled regard as many others have ( at the time I considered it more of an MTV-styled take on a very powerful topic ) . But now watching it years later ( 2006 I mean , despite what the date of this comment says ) I watch it , having gone through lots of other film-viewing experience , and I like it a lot more . In a way what's really mesmerizing and heartbreaking about the picture is that the contrivances are not based in the actual script or story - not that there isn't one or two that might be hard to not have in there - but rather a sort of fashioning of continuous cinematic contrivance . In other words , Aronofsky pushes the bounds of everything that can be done with the camera and editing in terms of subjective-viewpoints , ideas through montage , and the power of abstractions in the realm of the main theme of the film - unattainable escapism . One might be tempted to compare to Eisenstein with the montage , but unlike him Arnonofsky isn't putting forward a political message , but a societal one . While the cinematography by Matthew Libatique and the editing by Jay Rambinowitz give the viewer the whole subjective , jarring view of what it feels like in the first person to do these dangerous drugs , some of the time , all this being says , it almost goes by too quickly ( if you blink you'll miss the characters actually intaking the drugs , which are done in half second cuts ) . Not that that's a bad thing , and in fact the techniques used here , which include fast-motion , camera - strapped - on - the - front - of - a - person shots , odd high-angle placements , and wild array of things done that I still wonder how one could think them up , are quite ingenious . Only one scene on a repeat viewing - when Sarah Goldfarb ( Burtyn ) is going totally off the deep-end in her apartment with the TV show spiraling around her - doesn't totally work for me . Also , it will be difficult for some people to view the characters in their dissension to demise . Bustyn , ( who , if you still believe the Oscars to really be a mark of merit for true achievements , proves this to be false via her loss to the much less warranted Julia Robert ) plays an old , lonely woman who dreams of getting on a game-show that she doesn't realize might not be real and decides her favorite red dress is all that matters for the show to the show . It's too small , so she goes to the doctor to get pills ( uppers ) and they do indeed work , but then she starts taking too , too many and ends up hallucinating that her refrigerator is moving ( the first film to use a refrigerator puppeteer by the way ) and then things start to spiral . This also goes for her entranged son Harry ( Jared Leto ) who is slipping into a descent into smack with his girlfriend Marion ( Jennifer Connelly ) who sleeps with other men and then some in order to get stuff when Harry can , and his best friend Tyrone ( Marlon Wayans in his best performance to date ) who is also descending , but might seem to have it not as bad as the others by the time the film ends . But like I said , it is hard to view these characters falling deeper and deeper into insanity and desperation and all since it is also difficult to sympathize with these people . Yet , by the end of the film I almost felt like I was going to burst into tears not because I felt sad for the characters but more because of how powerful there journey led then to their destination . Like it or not though , this film begs for multiple viewings - and some extra years of looking at other films , which was the case with me . There is almost no room for true catharsis at the end , and nothing will ever be the same for anyone , especially as they're alive and lacking redemption ( though if I had to place who's story is most compelling , and performance-wise as well , it would be Burstyn's ) .
one of the more imaginative , thoughtful , complex possible ' cult ' films of the decade	It's not very often that Phillip K . Dick's writings get adapted well on to the screen . Films like Paycheck and Impostor might have there moments , but there is much lacking where high-tech action scenes and dreary direction replaces more of the thought in his work . Richard Linklater's A Scanner Darkly , however , could be part of that handful of films ( the others Scott's Blade Runner and Spielberg's Minority Report ) that do justice to his sensibilities as both a science-fiction spinner and social satirist . The technique he uses to add some imagination is , at first assumption , interesting but a little outdated . Rotoscoping the live action with animation has been done since the late 70's , and Linklater himself used it for maybe his most philosophically complex film Waking Life . Here though the same technique he used before is put into a narrative that , compared to Waking Life , is non-linear to the point that it is very faithful to Dick's work . But there's more than meets the eye , literally , to what Linklater is doing with his technique . It really does fit the mood of the film , one where to abscond is almost second nature , but the control over thought and the similarly powerful self-destruction comes at high prices for decent people . To discuss the story would have to involve much explanation of the characters , who they may ( or may not as case is ) be , and how drugs make up the integral , damned environment . Keanu Reeves is in one of his best performances , arguably , as Bob Arcter , apart of dealing what is called Substance-D , a very detrimental narcotic that sooner or later starts to play serious tricks on a person's mind ( left brain vs . right brain is in many scenes ) . But Reeves is also Officer Fred , who has been assigned to infiltrate a group of addicts who might lead him and his police force into the higher networks of drug distribution . Those around him in his " undercover " state are James Barris ( Robert Downey Jr ) , Ernie Luckman ( Woody Harrelson ) , Charles Freck ( Rory Chochrane ) , and in one of the most crucial parts to the story Donna ( Winona Ryder , quite a good comeback part ) . The theme of dehumanization around such technologies as a scanner in this film , where Fred / Arctor takes footage from the dingy home he usually hangs out in , are also akin to other pieces of Dick's work . I'm reminded of the tragedy in Minority Report of the cop who gets hooked on an illegal drug , and for what purpose in that story is made quite clear . In A Scanner Darkly , however , the lines of morality are never totally clear , and the ambiguity goes along as little pieces start to fit together . While I might hold it as being one of the great Philip K . Dick adaptations , it's not to say that it is quite different from the others ; this is not too far removed from what Linklater's style of dialog . To be sure to not please all in the sci-fi crowd , it's actually closer to being another of Linklater's ' in-the-now ' stories of characters who talk , and talk some more , and it forces one to pay attention as opposed to having the dialog go light for more action . Downey Jr . , who delivers one of the best supporting turns of the year , maybe has the most words to speak , as he's a character with few real morals but almost too much on his mind . And him along with Harrelson's character help define some of the pressing facts that go into looking at drugs in a movie . There's real paranoia , real mis-trust , a shifting of cognizance that becomes startling . One scene in particular , when Reeves is in bed with a woman and can't figure on if she is really SHE or not , and then goes over in in video , is an excellent take on the depths to which Substance-fictional for the film's sake but related to many real substances - and how the style connects very much so to the substance ( no pun intended ) in the film . The style itself , provided by the animation directors , gives some immediate fascinations for the viewer . The whole idea of a character putting on a suit and being able to shift around faces and clothing at a second a clip provides such catching beats each time . The variations in certain scenes work very much as well . And there are more than a few instances where the style of rotoscoping itself , which makes the film seem immediately like a ' take drugs and watch this movie ' , is called into question . One might then ask before going into A Scanner Darkly , where the control of products that act as controls & / or inhibitors , is anti-drug or pro-drug . That I cannot quite , completely answer , though I might lean more to the former . Linklater , not just Dick , has several potent questions among others that may fizzle that are posed into the film , especially towards the last ten minutes . And what is even more surprising , and closer to being a relief , is that the film isn't even too preachy either . In fact , I was laughing through scenes in the middle bulk of the film , as Downey and Harrelson's characters made for some very sharp , witty lines and odd actions . In short , it's got a different , ' quirky ' artistry that combines some very good cinematography with so much that is tested with colors and shading and tones on the actors and settings that I will have to watch it again to take it all in . And the actors , more often than not , are completely fit in their roles , even when they suddenly reveal that all is not as it seems ( I loved some of the twists that pop up ) . A cool premise and a superb use of abstractions as reality in the midst of the darkest satire of the year .
quite simply the most ambitious , brawny , throw-in-everything remake in quite some time , definitely of the year	Peter Jackson should be proud of this movie . But this is , of course , a popcorn movie first and foremost ( and the original was that much more enjoyable as almost the first ' blockbuster ' of it's kind ) , and on that level is really where this film strikes the goods . I heard much hype around it , and knew that at the least it would be a BIG movie ( and I say that after the fact complimentary ) . First off , you have a director being paid the highest up-front salary in history straight off his last film winning 11 Oscars ( him winning three , at least two ) and getting to paint his ' canvas ' with a new treatment of what started him off to direct in the first place . So , in short , there is some level of major passion going on in the outset . But , of course , that also leaves room for potential disappointment . For me , aside from maybe one factor I'll get to in a bit , it really wasn't . In keeping with Ebert's sort of take on the film , Jackson does take on all of the potential possibilities and runs with them with a pack of steroids on his back ( another point meant as a compliment ) . With a story that is , at the core , very simple ( a lot of Beauty and the Beast aspects , of course , though also packing in the tale of ego driven to the ground , with plenty of action and comedy to fill in the gaps ) , this is a ' remake ' that does go to the limits , and then passes them , and then tries to take the audience along for the ride . Jackson and his Wingnut films people and visual effects people at WETA ( if that's what it's called ) fill up all of the dark , wild , almost over-the-top things that can be done . And , like George Lucas ( when he's at his best ) , he uses computer animation , immense visions , pushing-the-envelope action sequences , and utter suspense to drive the excitement into the film . Even if you dis-like the movie , it's hard to say that this is JUST another ' dumb action clunker ' . Part of that , in the end , is also attributable to the substance of the picture , how Jackson balances out between the outrageous set-ups and pay-offs with what is a tender love story , and story of people's attitude towards what is unknown . The contrast in the three leads also breathe some good life by way of the actors - Jack Black as the driven , sometimes insatiable movie-maker out to get it all come hell or mad dinosaur ; Naomi Watts turns in some fine , even touching work as the charming , curious actress Ann Darrow ; Adrien Brody as the writer makes it all the more believable as he is just naturally fit for this survivor / do-whatever-it-takes / got heart kind of guy . Indeed , there isn't an incredible amount of dimension , of course , but maybe there doesn't need to be . If the film itself is akin to all those stories of man vs . monster , with all that goes with it ( King Kong itself has become apart of the pop-culture landscape , for decades now ) , so are the characters , and even to the ' types ' the leads and supporting players play to . I keep on mentioning Jackson though because it really , despite all of the back-breaking ( and finger-clicking ) work of the huge crew and visual effects people , is almost all coming from him , and it is where he brings out for me with this film - which might be my favorite of his so far ( not to put down LOTR too much of course ) - what I love about these kinds of movies , and what sometimes can get on me about them . My main example of this duality is the back-to-back sequences while on the island . There is this brilliantly paced , no-holds-barred fight between Kong and two dinosaurs , which even continues into a space loaded with vines . It almost becomes over-kill , and then finishes just wonderfully ( albeit quite violently - not a lot of blood , parents , but little kids might be freaked ) . Then comes a whole sequence after that , rather gruesome , of some of our heroes getting devoured and covered by over-large insects . It's here where though I still praise Jackson , I feel a little of the excess of the picture as well . Which , in a way , I guess might be inevitable for some . I know there will be some , as well , who would not be interested in seeing the film , and if you know who you are then maybe just wait for it on TV ( if that ) . However , for this time of the season ( if not of the season then at least this week ) there's no movie I would recommend more for wide / big-screen , action packed , and very storytelling-successful film-making than this . When I can almost forget how a movie is moving along , that it just flows like this ( for better or worse ) , is pretty incredible .
" You can't take the sky from me "	Intrigued by the film Serentiy , which I saw before Firefly , as well as a lot of the work Joss Whedon has put out , I checked out the entire series ( which , sadly , is only 14 episodes including the original pilot ) , and it is everything positive that I've heard about it , and then some . What Whedon does best here is work on characters . And there's story , of course , and there's at least a few stand-outs ( i . e . Our Mrs . Reynolds , Jaynestown , the series finale episode ) , but it's most of all getting into a loving ( or loving to hate ) all these people about the Serenity ship . Even with River's character , who for a good portion of the series is kind of annoying and / or useless to whatever's going on ( and , oddly enough , she and her doctor brother Simon are mostly awol for one particularly great episode ) , starts to grow on the viewer and by the end - i . e . the final episode - she's totally intriguing and worthwhile to develop . Running it down , there's the Captain , who's strong and courageous and all that but also can take incredible pain ( i . e . torture in that one episode ) and has a great knack for sarcasm that works off of everyone else really well ; Zoe , the second-in-command , who fought with Reynolds in the war years back and is now married to the smart , lovable but also sarcastic and down-to-earth pilot Walsh , whom we first see playing with dinosaurs in the pliot and only gets better from there ; Simon and River , who I mentioned , are self-explanatory as brother / sister who are fugitives aboard the Serenity but with Simon as a more interesting character in his sensitivity and quasi-nerdiness ; Jayne , part bad-ass part dummy , is lovable in an odder way , and his centerpiece episode , Jaynestown , is a riot ; the Shepherd is really cool as a wise sage , but also has some tricks up his sleeve when the time comes ( who is he really , could be his trademark ) ; smarmy , hot and emotionally wearisome Inara , who's on as a prostitute going along for the ride in her own separate bunker and usually comes to the rescue ; and the mechanic Kaylee , who's sweet and adorable but also a hard nut for Simon to crack as a romantic couple . Sound like a lot ? Not really ; one of the big joys in Firefly is to fall in with the characters from episode one , and from there little by little we learn and know about all of the characters , be they in flashbacks or revelations from another character , or if it's through a test of will . Adding to this the acting is , for a sci-fi TV show , superlative , with every actor ( even Summer Glau as the figity and , again , annoying River ) filling in their roles to a T , and then some as with Adam Baldwin and Nathan Fillion . There's a pleasing combination of convoluted romantic entanglements and action throughout the series , sometimes to extremes with the latter - as to how much Fox can show per episode with people getting shot or killed or maimed or stabbed , etc - that seems to fit in with Whedon's aesthetic . And , finally , there's the surprising sophistication with mixing cultures and tastes on the show . Aside from the dialog , which is a weird mix of English ( 90 % of the time of course ) and Chinese ( the rest of the time , cleverly for stuff that's throwaway lines ) , we get the " Old West " , we get the futuristic gadgets and special effects and ( for a one-season TV show eye-popping ) CGI , and it all feels organic to what the writers and directors are going for . This is where no man has gone before , only rougher , tougher , and with some extra heart and big sense of humor . I loved the hell out of this show , and I only wish it ran for longer than it did .
Easy in Bold letters	Bob Rafelson's Five Easy Pieces is as decent and interesting as movies get , with great characterizations ( Nicholson is excellent as always , but the supporting performances from Black and others contribute also to the feel ) and some music that borderlines from fine to overdone . Many memorable scenes included , one of them Nicholson's famous chicken-salad speech , plus a challenging ending .
On the whole , so to speak , or by itself , the second part of Kill Bill fits the Tarantinian psychology	Although , as a film buff myself , having a whole Kill Bill epic in one sitting would've been satisfying , like the first part that was split Vol . 2 works extraordinarily well . In terms of storytelling it's direct and ( of course ) unconventional , in style Tarantino pays homage / borrows ( or depending on your point of view steals ) from most of the films that stew around in his arsenal . And with dialog , in maybe a couple of moments it doesn't seem up to par , but it's not often . And the acting is in the greatest tradition of B-movie , spaghetti western , shaw-brothers , kung-fu et . all . If you look at both Kill Bills it's fascinating as a movie buff to discover things you haven't seen before ( i . e . the whole blood-coated style of the climax in vol . 1 ) and things you recognize right away ( i . e . the unmistakable songs of Ennio Morricone , who is just as creditable as Leone for Tarantino's style ) . What's there to say about the story , except that it picks up where it left off ? Sort of - as usual , the non-linear story aspect kicks in , and two sections of the film derail from the continuing story of revenge on the DIVAs and Bill ( the squad members this time being the perfectly paced in tone and presence Michael Madsen as Budd , and Daryl Hannah's most vindictive role as Elle Driver ) . At first , we get a stark , black and white view of what the " Massacre at Two Pines " was like , and right away we're introduced ( finally ) to Bill , played by David Carradine , one of the most calm , affecting film villain performances in recent memory . The other derailment is to tell the immensely entertaining story of The Bride's training by the heavy-duty Pai Mei ( Gordon Liu , in one of his performances in the whole KB saga ) . This could be counted as the funnest part of the film , aside from a few key moments , as the camera sweeps from medium to close up happen every thirty seconds or so . In the acting department , as I've said , Tarantino gets a big boost - this could be counted as being one of the key performances of not only Carradine's career , but Thruman's as well . They elevate the mood of Tarantino's ( sometimes ) tongue-in-cheek dialog , but they're also pro's that do their best when it comes time to the showdown , with monologues that come close to being QT's most memorable ( although not his best - as cool as it all sounds , it doesn't hit the Pulp Fiction marker ) . When it does end , the whole operatic sense of the film seems to work , and to the audience it will either be a fitting end or a disappointment . It is , at least , the most ambitious action / comedy / drama / kung-fu / western / romance film ( this is referring to Vol . and both volumes together ) in many a moon ; it's a lot like opening up the filmmaker's skull , and getting a scrambled up dosage of his memories and references , and it works much more often than not . Oh , and how about a bit of applause to Bob Richardson and Michael Parks !
one of my favorite westerns	Nicholas Ray , one of those rare directors who could put in a style or outlook of his own in various films of different conventional types in 1950's Hollywood , has with his film Johnny Guitar a job very well done . I had the chance to see it on the big screen at a revival screening some months ago ( mostly among Joan Crawford fans ) on a double bill with Sam Fuller's Forty Guns . Crawford , McCambridge , and definitely Sterling Hayden ( one of my all-time favorite ' guy ' actors ) brought a lot to the entertainment factor of the film . The story goes like this ( and if you've seen Sergio Leone's Once Upom a Time in the West , you'll notice obvious similarities , as his was a slight homage of this film ) - Crawford owns a bar / parlor on the edge of town . The townspeople want her out to make way for a railroad , most vocally of this is McCambridge ( in maybe the best performance of the film , really the most theatrical ) . The title character is played with usual panache by Hayden , who at first is a little enigmatic , then reveals himself to have a past with Crawford . The story then unravels from there , in a way that actually went against my expectations , much to my delight . This is the kind of genre picture that knows what it is , but with a director clever enough to take chances . For example , there is the contrast of color between Crawford and the angry townspeople near the beginning of the film . She's playing the piano on one side of the room in a white dress , while the others , the supposedly ' good ' people of the town , are all in black . Is Ray messing with the convention of good guys white , bad guys black , or do we have to keep attentive all the way through to know how it plays out ? I think you'd have to - this is one of those westerns that has enough excitement , humor ( mostly dark or unintentional ) , and a climax that goes with some of the best of them . At the least it should hold up for those expecting something very dated - it's not quite as towering as the Leone films , but on its own terms Ray has a contender against all those old-school Ford / Wayne westerns .
perhaps the boldest , and maybe just the best , of all action comedies	The General provides the kind of blockbuster entertainment a lot of today's action-film fans don't know what they're missing and provides the kind of humor that's varied in physical prowess and ingenuity with timing and detail and deadpan expressionism . While Passion of Joan of Arc may make us bawl out in tears and City Lights and Sunrise marvel us with the joys of living , The General is just rollicking fun filmed to a perfection within its limitations . It might tell a slightly contrived love story ( i . e . she'll only even speak to John if he is in a uniform despite a reasonable explanation why he's declined to fight at first ) , and some of its special effects sequences are near unbelievable , but Buster Keaton and collaborator Clyde Bruckman are so in control of their elements - of crowds , of the speed and intricacies and idiosyncrasies of the train , of Keaton in the midst of Civil War terror - that it's hard to see it as anything else but a classic of its time and beyond . Just the sheer physicality is incredible ; watching Keaton put together these sequences , from the bits of him trying to load up a train with wood to getting onto another rail of tracks to dodge the other cars and just running around and then having the hundreds of soldiers running and fighting and in battle formation , is nearly overwhelming . The General is only 75 minutes but it feels epic and full of grandeur , and its got some hysterical set-pieces to boot ( watching Keaton and his female lead getting out of a bear trap is enough to belly laugh and cringe at the same time ) on top of its breakneck pacing . In a sense there isn't a whole lot of plot even as it tells a very carefully constructed story in the strictest action-movie sense of the word : a man in love with his engine and the girl of his dreams isn't allowed in the army , but nevertheless takes some kind of control over his " General " train car , and one night overhears of a plot to sabotage his Confederate buddies , which he'll stop in the most insane circumstances imaginable . The General provided me with two things consistently , and didn't let up for its entire running time : sheer cinematic prowess the likes of which is equable to the greatest and brawniest of silent pictures where you barely need a title card to keep things moving along ( and of all things a train is a really clever vehicle , no pun intended , to keep the action and the story without any real lulls save for Keaton's pratfalls ) , and Keaton himself as a one-of-a-kind clown . He's not exactly always sweet and delightful in the sense that Chaplin is , but in his very downtrodden and almost serious way he's the best kind of comedian you could ask for in this environment . It's based on a true story , which adds to the appeal of the sort of frowning clown of action - one of the truly spectacular stunt-men even in just loading a gun or bringing out his blade - that Keaton is quintessential in being . And it goes without saying that by the time we get to that bridge blowing up it simply reveals itself as a towering HOW-did-they-do-THAT set piece you couldn't try and fake on a computer . Loaded with sublime craftsmanship and daring-do ( and all on the " good-guy " side of the confederates ! ) , the General is not one to miss . And anyone thinking that a silent film doesn't have the power to keep an audience dulled by empty-headed and soulless and trashy Hollywood entertainments need to look back at this . It's a need fulfilled to the Nth degree .
perhaps the major studio triumph of Touner's career ; cast is fantastic	To see Robert Mitchum in a film like Out of the Past is to see one of the benchmarks of the film-noir era and style of film . He wears his trench-coat through many scenes of the film , looking weathered yet strong in his own way as he's put against the elements , and there's a certain tragedy in his performance at times even as he's one of the cooler stars of the 1940's Hollywood system . He stars as Jeff Bailey , a private-eye turned gas station attendant with a past involving a woman , a criminal , and a messy affair that left him running into a kind of ' quiet ' life . But he's brought back out of it by his old ' boss ' - in a terrific early role from Kirk Douglas ( his first scene in the film , as well as one with Jane Greer in the third act , ranks as great ) - into something of a trap . While director Jacques Tourner and his screenwriter do a very credible job in telling the story , particularly in setting up the characters and the inherent flaws in them all via the flashback romance , is that the atmosphere trumps over . Tourner , who had his early breaks in the B movies of Val Lewton , does the story and the characters a splendid service in how he gets down the urban settings , and even the scenes in Mexico , on the beach , in a very foreboding office towards the end of the film . There are a few taut twists , but they all work , and the entanglement of Jeff , Kathie and Whitt is one of those classic examples of how its down believably . You might be able to sense what could have been between Jeff and Kathie , but in this situation who's to say why it shouldn't be as dark and ( perhaps ) existential as this ? It's not a humorless film either , and seeing it in an sold-out audience is a delight to add with the entertainment .
Kurosawa's triumphant epic - totally & successfully driven by character and story	Akira Kurosawa was and is considered the master of east-western film-making ( in that he made his Japanese films accessible for fans of American westerns while still making the movies his country found popular ) , and out of the few Kurosawa movies I've had the pleasure of viewing ( Hidden Fortress , Rashomon , and this ) I'd have to say that while Rashomon is still my favorite , I nevertheless had a blast during this one . The story has become quite influential to filmmakers from the likes of John Sturges ( The Magnificent Seven ) to John Lasseter ( A Bug's Life ) : a small village has been terrorized by bandits for far too long , amid times of civil war in the nation , and so on the advice of Grand-Dad , they decide to hire four - which soon becomes seven - samurai for the job . There's no money , just food and honor , even though the village isn't exactly pleased to have samurai back in their village . Each character is drawn and executed compellingly , though for my money Toshiro Mifune proves why he became one of Japan's most notorious film actors . His work as the brave , bold outcast of the seven is awe-inspiring practically all the way through , like the hero of a western that anyone can root for since he's a true rebel at heart within a group of men with a task at hand . Kurosawa directs his tale and main and supporting players like a grand composer , orchestrating a vivid story and extracting from great actors like Takashi Shimura ( the old , wise Samurai ) , Ko Kimura ( the disciple Samurai ) , Daisuke Kato ( Schichiroji ) , and Mifune ( Kikuchiyo , which isn't his real name ) just the right touches of humanity , humor , tragedy , romance , and intensity . The overall intensity , by the way , isn't over-estimated ; its long length ( almost 3 hours ) isn't distracting in the slightest since Kurosawa's editing and photography ( the later helmed by Asakazu Nakai ) are extraordinary . Not to compare the two films , but one thing I saw in common with Seven Samurai and a Lord of the Rings film is that , if anything else , it definitely isn't a boring experience . Along with a score by Fumio Hayasaka that gives the film just a bit more of a pulse , and a showdown that is relentless with excitement , this is one of the must-see action films for film buffs , or anyone with an serious interest in having fun with an epic .
disarming , honest look at the practices of salesmen on the road	Albert and David Maysles , apparently working from a personal source ( the four men , nicknamed the Gipper , the Rabbit , the Bull , and the quasi-lead being the Badger , all come from or around the Irish-Boston section that the Maysles came from as well ) , found themselves a kind of theatrical core to what is , in terms of the actual shooting , about as straight-on as can be in documentary cinema . Al Maysles , especially , would make the bulk of his work in the future just like this - shooting with just him on camera and a sound-guy ( in this case David ) - and it has the feel of being right there and up front in the situations . What the Maysles called " direct-cinema " , as opposed to the term Cinema Verite . It's not exactly a news program , but it's not your run-of-the-mill documentary either . While the brothers put their subjective view on the material by , of course , choosing what not to show ( who knows if the men made more sales than were actually shown , or if there were more quiet moments or conversations in the motel rooms that rambled further ) , and in the editing process of who to cut to or what to close-in or back away from , it feels always fresh in perspective . We're really right there seeing what is going on during the sale , as well as seeing how the men " unwind " by complaining about the sales they didn't make , the things that kept them from what they had to do , which was put forward the " # 1 bestselling book in the world " for 49 . 99 a month to your average Joe or Mrs . Joe down the street . What the Maysles don't ask is to make you really put a very harsh judgment either way ; by both sides presented , of the men in the desperate but completely professional and slick act of selling ( selling themselves probably just as much as the bible , and how getting the sale or not suddenly changes them in front of the prospective customer ) , and how they are behind closed doors , shooting the s , playing cards , or driving in their cars . Most especially fascinating , however , is that the Maysles put a theatrical ring to the proceedings , like watching characters from a stage play ala O'Neill in the great drama of life - characters , by the way , who can be talked about just as real people as figures in a film . Seeing Salesman gives a glimpse not so much into religion - they're not sermonizing here , the Maysles - but into a specific world that doesn't exist the way it used to , where men followed along leads from previous sellers , and sometimes made it through the door or not at all . There's a disarming quality to the production ; we should think that these guys aren't the ones to like or identify with , that we're the ones getting peddled to and made to feel like we MUST get this or else and so on . By opening it up just by a glimpse , and how the 16mm camera goes around with the freedom of the fly-on-the-wall , it opens up the perspective . It's one of the Maysles's very best , a piece of true Americana as a time capsule .
arguably Wilder at his very best ; Swanson , Holden , and von Stroheim are about perfect	I was a little speechless after I first finished watching Sunset Blvd . I had an idea of what to expect , but I didn't expect that a film made over half a century ago would be so sharp , so artistically compelling , and so tragic while still containing a blistering sense of humor . In some ways it was ahead of its time with its satire , ironically in a film that looks to the past with a sense of sad , but honest nostalgia . Gloria Swanson , the star of the film , plays a woman who is a star still in her old mind , Norma Desmond . There are a handful ( how big the hand is depends on the particular viewer ) of films where you have a character or characters that are not only unforgettable , but become so trenched in the public consciousness its hard to think of mistaking it for anything else . Even as a kid and knew that line " I'm ready for my close-up , Mr . DeMille " was a basic , but dead-on swipe at ego , or at least stardom . That it was in this context makes it all the more comic / tragic . That Sunset Boulevard also has the distinction of being in the film-noir tradition along with having some satirical grounding solidifies it one of the really unique films of the Golden Age of post World War 2 America . The story starts with our protagonist and past-tense narrator , Joe Gillis , who is a struggling B movie screenwriter in Hollywood . Fate , or maybe just odd luck , pits him into the driveway of a big , almost archaic estate that almost looks haunted to him on first sight . He meets Norma Desmond , whom he doesn't recognize as once being a big silent movie star . " I am big , " she says in one of her trademark lines , " it's the pictures that have gotten small . " She confides in Gillis , after he tells her who he is and why he's there ( hiding out as it were ) , that she has a screenplay she wants DeMille to direct as her ' comeback ' . He very reluctantly agrees to do it , and very soon gets sucked up into her world , becoming disconnected to his small circle of Hollywood friends . But he still has one , as a kind of secret almost , Betty Schaefer ( the beautiful Nancy Olson ) , who is an aspiring screenwriter . One can maybe guess what might happen as this goes on , but like with Wilder's other great films , the unexpected moments and keen revelations / coincidences are the best parts ; Erich von Stroheim as Max , Norma's ' butler ' , is surprisingly good . I've seen Sunset Blvd . several times now , but I can't forget how much I laughed the first time around ; I wondered why it was even considered in the ' film-noir ' tradition ( not that it didn't have its stylistic or character bearings , but compared to Double Indemnity it didn't seem as pumped up ) . I really took it as a kind of pioneering black comedy , with Norma Desmond as the delusional , self-fulfilling has-been . For example , when Gillis first arrives and Max and Norma bury her pet monkey - it's not just the image of the dead monkey and the reverence paid to it , but also as they bury it Gillis ' wry narration . The narration in this film is another great trademark , with that kind of snappy later 40's / early 50's wit that helped move from the kind of wit that was in earlier Hollywood films . And of course there are some other absurdities that bring out a few good laughs , in particular when Norma visits DeMille in the studio , and gets suddenly by some surreal miracle all the attention she's been having in her head . In repeated viewings , the film does show itself as darker , with a lot more thought put into the themes and real problems in the characters . Not just Norma , but also Joe , who little by little becomes more like the sneaky son of an overbearing mother than a real collaborator . The final scenes , which link up to the " end scene at the beginning " , and then the sort of crazy , classic epilogue of Norma on the staircase , more of the film-noir elements come through . The ' average Joe ' , so to speak , in over his head ; the sinister elements that are around him ( more so here psychological than criminal ) ; and of course the ' black widow ' in Norma Desmong . Swanson , in what should've been her Oscar winning role , never misses a beat . Through her delusions of grandeur and overwhelming nostalgia for the old days ( another great scene is when she makes him watch all her old silent films ) , there is also a vulnerability that doesn't make her a totally hateful character . And through all of this is one of the best screenplays that's ever come out of the Golden Age of Hollywood . As I mentioned the narration is sharp and observant , as in a sort of Pulp-noir novel , and the dialog for the time isn't very unconvincing . The relationships , like the one between Joe and Betty , is handled gently , so that the punch that's given to the viewer at the end has more of an impact . Max , as well , is maybe even more a complex character than Norma ; why stay as a butler for a woman who is almost in a time warp ? Perhaps he is too . Maybe that's one , perhaps subtle , message to the film - as much as it is fascinating to look to the past , to get locked into it is something very detrimental . But the film may not have a very clear-cut message , as it is a dense film with different appeals to different people ( like a Kubrick film ) - it's funny , it's romantic , it's sly , and at times very weird . I can't wait to see it again .
seen it just once : it's one of the most unusual , and unlikely dark comic masterpieces , of the 60s	Roman Polanski steers a film along in one location or kind of place with just a few characters like it's nobody's business . He's one of the most brilliant at it , at being able to veer away from making things static and stagey with a possible chamber piece like Knife in the Water or Death and the Maiden . Cul-de-sac is no exception , but it also has the distinction of being one of Polanski's comedies - however here , perhaps , it's the most successful and masterful of them all ( albeit the others I can recall are Fearless Vampire Killers and Pirates , which are good but lessor works ) because of his trust in the purely existential horror of the situation . I was laughing to the kind of harrowingly funny situations the characters would get into , or the strange awkwardness of such things as a little kid wielding a shotgun and cursing or watching poor Jack MacGowran stuck with a bullet in his belly in the getaway car as it slowly sinks in the coming tide . But lest not forget that as with many other Polanski films , for all of his own ferocious and oddly subtle command of a lens ( most notable is the 7-minute long take on the beach which is only fluid inasmuch as the characters slightly move about in the setting ) , the performances catapult it into uncharted territory of eccentricity and brilliance . Lionel Stander , for one , gives maybe one of his definitive performances in a career of minor character actor parts ( i . e . " you might remember me as Barman in Once Upon a Time in the West ) , characterized by his gravely voice and quintessential tough-guy-noir face and demeanor , playing one of the criminals taking over and hiding out in the 11th century castle of Donald Pleasance and Francoise Dorleac . Pleasance and Dorleac are also perfectly cast as seeming caricatures ( Pleasance's George as the meek and mild-mannered retired worker and Dorleac as his dripping - with - French - sexy - and - slightly - crazy wife ) who peel back layers of their characters as it goes along . At the least , it should be noted , it's an incredible career highlight for the underrated Pleasance and an intriguing and nasty turn from Dorleac . Cul-de-sac is a howler of a black comedy , with pitch black jokes involving a dead body and his burial , the untimely arrival of a bunch of George's bourgeois friends , and ending in a crazy purging freak-out from George . Sometimes single lines stand out ( Stander delivering " Mental retiring or something " is classic ) , or just a sudden physical motion , and Polanski is always there to add some taut level or even claustrophobia . But what is richest of all in the film is the implications on the human capacity for choice and cruelty . Throughout George is made a point of ridicule , mostly by his own wife , for not being manly enough to stand up to this grater-voiced thug and is not helped by him first appearing - as a funny / personal in-joke between husband and wife - in lipstick and a dress , and we see both his entire spectrum of personality and psychology along with the wife and Richard ( poor MacGowran , as mentioned , is relegated mostly to being laid out on a table pontificating as a yin to Richard's yang ) . If there could be a word to apply to what unravels in Cul-de-sac morbid would probably be the one to use in describing the bulk of the picture . And Polanski , no stranger to morbidity , transforms his picture into a bizarre , troubling and , very morbid and complex examination of what lies beneath a simple film-noir ; it's very funny , very tragic , and satisfying as 60s cinema could get . Only drawback : lack of decent prints in the USA and lack of access to videos make it near impossible to see the picture as originally intended or in good condition . Thankfully , it's so good that one can forgive finding the occasional bootleg with so-so transfer quality .
WOW	I saw this film for the first time tonight and even though it is a re-release from the original 1984 feature and not new , I found it to be one of the best films I've seen his year . It is ingeniously done by It's actors and It's first time film-makers , Joel and Ethan Coen who bring such a disturbing film it makes Fargo look like Carebears . And keep in mind I walked into this film without no knowledge of the story or characters , so that ( and the people working on the film ) made it entertaining . The story is very complicated , but it involves a wife ( Frances McDormand in a comanding first role ) who is cheating on her husband's ( Dan Hedaya is very good ) bar worker ( John Getz ) . So , Hedaya gets a sleazy hitman guy ( M . Emmet Walsh ) to kill her wife and his lover . But then it gets pretty messed up after that , and even though it takes place in Texas , it isn't a Chainsaw Massacre . But , don't also be expecting a film that is cuddly also . The picture is helped along the way not only by It's acting , writing and direction , but also by It's cinematography by now director Barry Sonnenfeld , who brings in a almost personality to the camera ( like in the Coen's Raizing Arizona ) and makes this film that much better . Definately a must see , especially for film-noir fans .
a kind of small , nifty absurd / surreal film-making	I saw this Roman Polanksi short on the Criterion collection DVD set , and it's definitely one of my favorites of his . It shares a lot with silent comedy , but it's a little more peculiar within its own conventional quirkiness . It's all about two men , and a wardrobe , as the title all too blatantly makes clear . But what ends up being surprising , funny , and even touching to an extent is where the wardrobe gets taken around to . They can't seem to get it really anywhere , and the destination of the wardrobe seems to be undetermined . It's really all a big excuse to showcase a mixture of silent-film comedy with an underlying message that could be read into . What's it like to bring along something or someone that is just very out of place ? This becomes all the more evident as the two men try to rest it down at some places , only to find they have to take it back up again and keep walking . I loved the bits of business that happened , but even just as much the light whimsy that's given to such a strange scene . What's more surreal than two men carrying a wardrobe along a beach ? And the music by the great composer ( who's best work is in Knife in the Water ) Komeda , gives the picture just that perfect quality that lends itself to being memorable still . It's 14 minutes of cinematic bliss for Polanski fans , and for a student film it's got a genuine lot of creativity , humor , and a point that is not lost amid the tact of entertaining to no end .
not sure if it's the most absolute " faithful " Dracula adaptation , but it's my favorite	Has there even been in the history of British horror such a clash of the titans ? Peter Cushing , a man who has super-high cheekbones ( more-so as he grows older , see : Star Wars ) and a face stern enough to scare schoolchildren silly , and Christopher Lee , a man who is somehow able to combine the everlasting creepyness of the Bela Lugosi Dracula with that of the somewhat charming and seductive Dracula of 1979's Frank Langella , only have their big title bout at the end of the picture as the classic villain / hero Dracula / Van Helsing face-off . It's well worth the wait , as the director , Terence Young , aided by a group of skilled and consummate professional craftsmen make what is not just a great Hammer movie but a great movie period . This is what one wants in a Dracula movie all-around . It might have some bright lighting in some scenes ( indeed the British aren't always fans of shadows or anything experimental when it comes to simple talking scenes ) , and as he one very minor liability Lee isn't quite in it as much as one might hope for ( his appearances are limited , but this may also be due to the short running time ) , but this is what essentially is the Bram Stoker myth made into hard-edged and occasionally very funny flesh and cinema . It's one thing that the script has no fat on its bones and makes us care about the characters with limited exposition . If anything it resembles a true-blue B-movie more-so the big-budget studio production . But it's another that the performers , all more or less classic British pros , make it so worthwhile . It's almost inarguable that Peter Cushing and Lee deliver two of their key performances in their careers . For Cushing he gets to deliver line after line with the kind of conviction and earnestness that would make other actors crap themselves , and he even casts a kind of bad-ass mold once or twice . For Lee his dialog is limited , which is just about perfect for him : we might not get a " I don't drink . . . wine " line , but we don't need it for this story . Dracula's presence is enough , and on that count Lee's performance is something of a minor miracle . Every actor ever playing Dracula must look at him in this movie , there's no getting around it . Matter of fact , anyone wanting to get another peek at how Dracula can be done with style and class and real chills and spills ( and , oddly enough , tasteful and fun for the kids ) , must look here . Period .
Truffaut adapts a hard edged , frightening , and hopeful futuristic action / drama	This is one of the most exciting , incendiary , and poignant films of Francois Truffaut's career . Any problems that happened off the set ( fueds between Truffaut and star Oscar Werner ) are not prevalent here - this is a film that with its style captures the kind of thought process behind Ray Bradbury's classic futuristic cautionary tale . I read the book in high school , and loved it , but hadn't seen the movie till recently . It was hard to remember most of the book ( coincidentally a theme in this film is remembering what books give us ) , but I remembered the major points - Guy Montag ( here played by Werner ) is a fireman , putting out books with fires . Like a gestapo rooting for prisoners for the concentration camp , they ransack homes they find suspect , and torch all the books in sight . The thought behind this , the boss says , is that books are what tear people apart . Instead , television is the enlightenment of the masses ( sound familiar ) . Montag doesn't question much of this until he meets a woman , Clarisse ( Julie Christie , curiously enough in another role as Montag's stagnant , common wife ) , who tries to instill Montag a meaning with books . This also flies over his head until he meets a professor or other , who somehow also stirs the bug in Montag . He starts to slip a book here and there during the fire raids , and is drawn in . It leads up to a kind of revolution in Montag's mind-set , where to run away from it all is the only choice left . These scenes are filmed with an intensity and urgency that is trademark in Truffaut ( i . e . most of 400 Blows , certain parts of Jules & Jim ) and on a sensory level gets to one almost above most other regular thrillers . We care about Montag , the sort of empty vessel that is starting to fill in , and it leads up to a somewhat funny , but rewarding finale . Truffaut , learning from one of his masters ( Hitchcock ) , not only gives Bradbury's story that extra push in certain scenes ( and certain restraint for psychological effect , i . e . scenes at Montag's house with his wife ) , there is a certain originality that gets to the viewer emotionally . During a couple of key scenes when the firemen are burning up the books , in particular with an old woman with the biggest hoard of them , he presents a montage of close-ups , all the various books and pages burning . This is a directness that would not have been found in Hollywood at the time , and it brings out the sense of loss that clouds over this society in the film . While many of the satirical points in the film are Bradbury's , and the ring truer today than ever before ( control , suppression of intelligence , control of the Government with the media ) , Truffaut's job of filming it is key and ultimately very successful . There are also the performances turned in ; Werner , maybe not as good as in Jules & Jim , makes a believable Montag , even through his struggling English ; Christie , juggling between two completely different characters , pulls it off ; Cyril Cusack as Montag's boss is like one of those villain roles that often gets overlooked in polls , as he really gets you to despise this character . One must also not overlook Bernard Herrmann's tense score , and eye-popping cinematography from Nicholas Roeg .
Herzog's ' 2001 ' , or the closest you'll ever see of Herzog doing an IMAX doc	What a strange experience to see Werner Herzog's documentary / drama / whatever movie the Wild Blue Yonder , particularly on the big screen . But it's the kind of strange experience I didn't regret in the slightest . This is a practically great film of visual magnificence and imagination , where Herzog , still on his never-ending search for adequate & new images ( unlike , as he says , ones that are overused or boring in the mass media ) , makes his ' science-fiction fantasy ' into one that blurs the line between fantasy and reality , between what is expected . Actually , I didn't really have any idea what to expect , and until I read a review of the film in the NY Times , I thought much of the film raised a lot of questions for me . Is what Herzog showing us for " real " , as it were , or just all fantasy ? Apparently , he was able to obtain ultra-rare NASA footage from a flight with a crew out in space , showing their mundane times up in their shuttle , and , more crucially , an under-ice Antarctica expedition of the " planet " that the film is sort of about . Seeing the trailer to the film though , and from what I remembered from it , was what really through me off . In fact you might take a look at the trailer and have no idea what the hell the picture is about ; all you see are interspersed images of underwater and space flight , and Brad Dourif as Andromedan alien talking to the camera in weird language . But seeing him in the film it's not weird at all . Indeed Dourif , for the sort of spaced-out but totally all-together-upstairs alien-man that Herzog presents us with , is perfect for the role , and is the best performance ( so to speak ) that he's delivered in quite a number of years of his long , terrific career as a character actor . He tells us of his time on his planet , then coming here , and then finding out that the government - after doing a bad thing unearthing the Roswell crash landing - are planning to seek out planets unknown in space . He sometimes narrates , sometimes appears on screen - and at one point delivers a speech about how human beings screwed themselves over in domesticating pigs , stirring up civilization as we know it - and it's sometimes very , irreverently funny , though never insincere or untruthful in his way . But Dourif isn't the only reason to see the movie , and I was glad that Herzog chose to not keep it all about him , or ' it ' , or whatever . Actually , there's an equally weird if somewhat more scientific explanation for certain ' worm-holes ' and ' holes ' and such by an astronomer ( Franklin Chang-Diaz ) that reminded me of my astronomy class in college only far more , uh , ' interesting ' . It's in-between these quasi-interviews that we get the real VISUAL side of the picture , and I put those words in caps for a reason . This is really extraordinary , if imperfect , in terms of capturing sights that some of us have never seen and most of us really haven't seen much outside of National Geographic channel junkies . We get the views into space , which are balanced with the shots inside the spaceship ( all taken by people from NASA , though at first I couldn't tell if maybe Herzog had a little extra budget going ) . There's even a really incredible moment where certain sights are shown from deep space , which may just be gasses or brightly colored formations , but they're really stellar . And then come the shots under ice , which at first I couldn't believe totally how they were done . In this case , in a sense , Herzog is even better as an editor this time as opposed to just getting the images down . He has to choose what to get through all of this via DP Henry Kaiser ( who also deserves a tremendous amount of credit ) . But there are little moments that stunned me , even after I knew where the location really was . For example , during the ' Tunnel of Time ' scene , where the astronauts go through a sort of " portal " through the ice up to who knows where , they almost seem to turn into particles or other and the disappear . It's really breathtaking for that moment . And then , in true Herzog fashion , he ends the film on nature itself , of which his Andromedan comments ' this is the new prehistoric age , hundreds of years from now ' . This all being said , the Wild Blue Yonder wont appeal much for everyone , least of which for those stuck to the normal bounds of logic and such . Truth be told , I didn't find everything completely awe-inspiring with the long-stretches underwater and in space , and the musical accompaniment is a mixed bag of sweet violins and overbearing signing ( which maybe is the point , as it sounds alien ) . Plus the side of the Stephen Hawking / X-Files sort , where Andomedan Man and physicians respectively come off as being too paranoid ( albeit an alien of course ) and too confusing with the formulas & numbers . Still , if you're a fan of Herzog , or even just into science fiction , its surely worth the look , and if not on DVD even better on the big-screen . It might even be one of my favorites from the director , at the least in his docu-hybrid form of film-making .
one of the best films of 1994	Here is an example of film-making elements coming wonderfully together , in a package that can entertain the usual moviegoers and give the movie-geek his or her money's worth . That it is also perhaps the most well-rounded of Tim Burton's films , with enough does of comedy , drama , and movie-within-movie stylings , to fit two movies is an added plus . He tells the story of Edward D . Wood Jr ( Johnny Depp ) , who may or may not be the most well-known bad filmmaker ever to exist with enough humanity and care to not make it at all parody , even if there is comedy interspersed . His story is one that is actually quite the same of most filmmakers , who want to make it somehow and have big dreams and lofty visions . Though taking into account Wood's preclivaty of wearing women's clothes ( particularly the angora sweaters ) , hanging out with transvestites and other undesirables , and his best friend is a thought to be dead ex-horror icon ( Martin Landau as Bella Lugosi , in a richly deserved Oscar turn ) addicted to methadone , the path of his story is rather unconventional to say the least . But the style of the film is quite ingenious , with rich and cool black and white photography , a finely moving and appropriate score ( though not by Danny Elfman ) , and touting an all around best-in-show cast . Depp especially has a lot of fun playing this man , who may or may not be close to how he was in real life ( from what I've read about him it's a fairly close depiction ) , and his portrayal of Wood is not at all cheating and is , in some scenes , really touching . The ones that stick out for me are the ones with Landau at his house , and filming his one scene from Plan 9 From Outer Space , but the ones with him on his ' sets ' , filming such drek with the passion and ambition of the greats , is really refreshing to see . Ed Wood is quite the biopic , showcasing Burton in another maturer form outside of films like Pee Wee and Batman , but with the same knack for entertainment . After all , how can you dislike a film with Tor Johnson , Elvira , and Bill Murray desiring a sex-change operation ?
surely one of the chilling , yet most effective , infidelity dramas ever made	Claude Chabrol is a director who has a vast ( and reputedly hit or miss ) career as one of the Cashiers du cinema alumni , and his film La Femme Infidele could possibly be counted as one of the top crop of his work . There's a control over mis-en-scene , as might be expected ( as he puts forth , unexpectedly and hilariously in a song that plays from a car stereo at one point , it's French ) , that is precise , observant , but also never overtly manipulative - it's almost so held-back emotionally that whenever a character seems to emote it's either through deception or by just the tip of the iceberg seeping through . This makes it all the more powerful , particularly because of how the ending doesn't really resolve anything except that these characters are doomed with each other . " I'm in love with you like mad , " says the husband Charles ( Michel Bouguet , perfect at that very understated , sincere and almost sinister approach to relating to people , even when seeming to be kidding ) , as there seems to be a sense of total disaster heading for both of them . But it's more of an existential sort - the law is left most ambiguous of all - and it's that which usually makes the best of dramas in lock-step with cuckolded and cuckolds and the like . If one's already seen Unfaithful , the Adrian Lyne 2002 Hollywood adaptation ( not so much remake ) of this film , then one already knows certain big pieces of the plot . The important thing though , in comparison with that film , which is still very good in its own right , is that this time we get only suggestions as to why Helene ( Stephane Audran , maybe her best performance ) is cheating on her bourgeois husband with writer Victor Pegala ( Maurice Ronet ) , and this is something that irks at Charles most of all . Idyllic comfort broken to pieces and shoved underneath is the context here , and it's with this that we see as opposed to Lyne's film a look not so much at the super-sexual and eventually melodramatic side of infidelity and the aftermath ( albeit just seeing Audran's legs is enough to get some men watching panting ) , but at complacency in the marriage and parenthood of their only child . Even if the child actor isn't very good at expression ( he says " I Hate You " and " I Love You " in the same note ) , there's always the level of discomfort in seeing the unspoken tension in the scenes with the three of them . And , if for nothing else , La Femme Infidele is a masterpiece of technique . So many shots and angles had me glued to the screen , knowing that there could be no other way to get it right . Surely the script leads much of Chabrol along his paths ( the actual moment of murder , however , is an ingenious editing trick ) , and what isn't there under the surface on screen is assuredly there on the page . But it's safe to put Chabrol on the level of artistry with his new-wave counterparts for shots like the one with Audran lying down on the bed , creeping up ever so slowly , and then cutting to a close-up , the one moment when we see just a slice of conscience . Or when Chabrol gets the emphasis of violence with a quick , simple shot of blood trickling down . Or how he balances out perspective at the house : look as the husband is watching out in the backyard at his wife , her out of focus yet still walking forward as the camera zooms a little more forward . And the last shot - following up on what has been many a decidedly Hitchcokian angle or note put forward , with a contemplative ' Vertigo ' shot of mother and son in long-view out of focus . It's one of the saddest ending shots in the history of French movies . It might sound like I'm hyping up this film up a little , but considering how underrated Chabol can be - in comparison to Truffaut and Godard and even Rohmer to an extent ( who , by the way , he co-wrote a book about Hitchcock with ) - La Femme Infidele deserves to be seen and re-evaluated not just in the context of " ah , it's French , and it's romance and tragedy . " To say that it's better than Unfaithful is an understatement , and it's only fault is that , if anything , it could be a little longer .
Not your typical ' revenge / action ' movie , but an absorbing , potent look at the cost of taking lives	Steven Spielberg has here his best film - or at least the best in his ' gritty ' sort of tradition that was hinted at in the Indiana Jones films , went full bloom in Schindler's List , and matured further with Saving Private Ryan and Minority Report - in many a moon . He uses his perfected skills at maneuvering the mis en scene , using some manipulation , but dealing as seriously as possible with a tense , haunting subject . I've seen many reviewers say the film is haunting , has a haunting quality . Indeed this is true , and it is certainly a running theme in many of Spielberg's best films . And much as it was as well with his two films which he won best director Oscars for , here he deals with not so much the difficult , intensely emotional , and seemingly un-ending power struggle between the Israelis and the Palestinians , but about the increasingly horrifying existential crisis for a man who to the government that hired him does not exist . This man is Avner , played with the utmost conviction by Eric Bana . Spielberg must have seen something in his eyes that could make him work in this role , and he does - when one looks at him , one can see the conflict that only grows deeper and darker as the film reaches its third act . He's been hired to track down and kill , with his team ( which includes great character actors like Matthieu Kassovitz and Daniel Craig ) , the eleven Palestinian terrorists who killed the hostages in the 1972 Olympics massacre . Things go well , at first , at least under the circumstances , as Avner also gets a little close with his ' source ' giving him the names of targets for hefty sums . But as they close in closer , and as the tension is consciously squeezed tighter into paranoia , things aren't going quite as planned . What makes a film like this work so brilliantly really is not what could be turned by another director into something more routine , and , indeed , condescending . Spielberg , when working with his rare R-rating to the maximum , doesn't shy away from giving us the full lot of what goes on in these raids , these bombings , shootings , plans of killing and striking back . But along the way he also gives some food for thought , so to speak , like an intriguing scene of dialog between Avner and a man in Athens ( not to say too much about it , though Al Green is playing in the background ) . And certain scenes rank with Schindler's List showing Spielberg with a full grasp of what he MUST show the audience , however some might find it to be eye-widening or cringe-worthy ( as it was for me ) . With his usually intuitive cameraman Janusz Kaminski , he creates this world as hellishly vivid as possible with a hand-held camera , and different color saturations for scenes ( plus the lighting , which has now become Spielberg / Kaminski's trademark for the past decade ) . And , in the end , it comes back down to what we care about with the character ( s ) , and the protagonist's story . Avner knows he has a job to do , getting paid immensely for something ( much like the Kurtz job in Apocalypse Now ) that does not ' exist ' . But the questions raised about what may or may not come of the Israeli / Palestinian conflict of course cannot be answered in the course of the film , only raised to a certain extent . If there is any message to the film - and I'm sure being it a Spielberg one there is ( and perhaps I didn't fully comprehend it on the first viewing , being wrapped up in the pure film-making aspect of it all ) - it may be that killing , taking life , even if it is OK'd by certain interested parties , will affect the soul , and the souls of those around you . That the message coincides with a taut precision with the characters , and the impeccable storytelling , makes it all the more worthwhile . The controversy around the film may be more from people who haven't see the film than those who have . Once seen , and the initial ideas of what the film might be about are gone , the story can be watched on its own terms .
a kind of lesson maybe for film-students - a LOT of fun	I remember getting a kick of this short repeatedly when I saw Bug's Life in the theater repeatedly eight years back . Mostly because it sticks to the best rules of a little animated short like this . Less is more with the dialog , and editing and position of the camera are crucial . The filmmaker behind this , who hasn't done much aside from this short , is like a very wise film-student . In most film-student shorts , a good chunk of the goal in making 4 or 5 minute films is to put in as much information as possible while keeping it to the point and still having a story . The story here is a guy playing chess , Er , with himself , and getting into a competition to the death ( well , almost ) in having a check-mate . Geri's laughs and little facial gestures on either side are really genius in their own way , and the ending is one of those that puts a smile on your face . The music is also , in its own way , funny by way of being just a lowly accordion applying the backup to this wacky little scenario . Probably ranks up there with my very favorite Pixar shorts , worth another look on the Bug's Life DVD for sure .
" I am Shiva , the God of Death "	So are spoken as some of the most desperate words - not crazy , there's a difference - in recent movie memory . Michael Clayton is about the character trying to deal with his hand of fate , which is pretty dire : he's 45 , working for 17 years for a law-firm where he's a " fixer " , cleaning up the problems that can't be solved through simple litigations . Now he has a problem with the chief attorney , the " legend " Arthur ( Tom Wilkinson ) who has just gone streaking after one of the witnesses in a parking lot . The whole case could fall apart , but is there more than meets the eye ? Murder , wire-taps , cover-ups , bombs , and at the core the placidity of a straight-laced face ( Tilda Swinton ) , are all apart of the not-too-complicated puzzle . It goes without saying that there is a little more than some debt that Gilroy owes to Network , if only in the face-value to be taken from the characters : the weathered professional , the nut who really has ecstatic truth in the Herzog sense , the cold and exacting woman , and the guy working as a top dog behind the scenes . But where Network was as dark as satires get , if there's any laughter to come out of Michael Clayton it's only in the extremely uncomfortable moments of Wilkinson walking in a daze through Times Square or disrobing maniacally on video , or a couple of chuckles at the wrap-up climax . It's a paranoid thriller where , in reality , it's not exactly paranoia in the strictest sense : if it's really happening , then it shouldn't be something to watch out for . But Gilroy continues to build on a sensibility of paranoia , of the darkness creeping up behind the corporate facade , of the sinister presence of those men in cars and vans with total access to whatever and whenever with the target . And you thought the Bourne movies - co-written by Gilory - were tense genre pieces . What makes a film like Michael Clayton end up as memorable as it is , almost essential for those wanting to go to the movies for a serious drama without pretense or extreme melodrama , is the script and the performances . It's indeed such a strong script that it surely covers over the direction - as a directorial debut it feels like the work of a professional with countless years behind the belt , with a few notes of experimentation ( the opening rambling voice-over on the looming , still shots of the empty rooms at the office at night , and the final shot as something that breaks away from what could be a bit more predictable and instead kind of haunting ) . And it's something as literate as this that allows for actors to go for what they can do best : for Wilkinson , Oscar worthy to a T , it's both subtle and over-the-top with Arthur , at one point making a masterful stroke of carrying loaves of bread ; Swinton makes the careful act of preparation and looking at a mirror like it's everything to the character ; Pollack , solid as usual , not too much to say . Then there's Clooney . Already one of those leading men in Hollywood that has enough clout to probably get Sim City made into a movie if he wanted to , when given a serious and complex enough part to dive into ( which has been frequent lately save for the Ocean movies ) he's near perfect . I love seeing him on the brink of exploding at Arthur when he first sees him going on and on in the prison cell , or when he levels with his kid about his druggie-bum brother , or just in the way he looks frightened and unsure at some horses in a field . And the aforementioned shot couldn't be done so well by anyone else - you don't want to leave the theater even as the credits roll by , because he might do something , something slight behind the usual super-handsome exterior as he leaves the audience wanting to see more . It's an excellent genre film , but it's probably one of the few near perfect performances of the actor's career ( and yes , I include Return of the Killer Tomatoes in that group ) .
" I feel as though there was someone else inside of me . "	It comes to mind immediately for comparison - Twin Peaks , the great cult TV show , as being what Takashi Miike used as influence for his much more ' cult ( or rather , little seen but raved in its small circles of fandom ) take on an investigation of bizarre crimes in an even more bizarre half real-half dream environment . In so much that Miike , via Eiji Ootsuka's original Magna book , does create something of an alternate reality , where the multiple personalities transfer , where the blurred vision of the girls in the room with strange incantations , and where it rains green drops , this is an accurate comparison to the notorious black lodge in Lynch's universe . But even through Miike's own acknowledged influence from Lynch ( one can see it pretty clearly in Miike's Gozu ) , it's only something of a surface comparison at best . MPD Psycho is perhaps even MORE confusing , at least at first , than TP , with the circumstances surrounding the crimes to hold a lot more mystery , and just weird fed up adult-oriented Japanese theatrics , and with its protagonist with just as many demons and past troubles as those he's after . Plus , in the world of MPD , there's no telling if the actual victim may be the criminal as well , or what might be connected or not . But all the same , as with a good whammy of a Magna ( or for that matter the average bear of a Miike flick ) , MPD Psycho is filled with incredible visual tricks and experiments , with animated bits ( the little girl drawn before our eyes ) , intentionally crude visual effects ( the rain drops , the quick visions into another personality as it transfers to another ) , and even creative censorship ; who knew that a filmmaker as outrageous and shocking as Miike could make it a riot to see private parts and ultra-bloody sections blurred out and make it work for the sake of the show ? Like Miike at his best , there are very satisfying doses of dark comedy thrown in , sometimes unintentionally ( " not your baby miss , you're just a vessel ? " ) , and sometimes with the dead-aim of Miike at his most playful ( the scenes in the big police lecture-hall where the one officer creates little clay figures he's very proud of ) and savage , like the numerous moments of unexpected violence - here toned down but still graphic in-so-much as what isn't shown , and how uncomfortable the subject matter becomes in dealing with dead-end abortions and whacked out Catholic girls . As with the most depraved scenes in Ichi the Killer and Visitor Q , sometimes one can't help but chuckle through the mayhem . Reccomending a series like MPD Psycho , perhaps , is a little trickier than in simply going on about what makes it a work where clarity in knowing what is going on - and it's not really incoherent when piecing it bit by bit , which the screenwriters and Miike end up doing very cleverly as each episode goes along ( with , by the way , an excellent turn from the ultra-cool but doomed Amamiya / Kobayashi / who knows ) - but rather if it would appeal to the average CSI type of TV viewer , or just to Miike's fan-base . In truth , I'd say for the former it's worth a shot , if only to see how Japan goes about turning the conventions of an mystery programmer on its head with levels of rough horror and chills and in-your-face satire . Though that being said , it's certainly not for anyone , not least of which for those who expect their detective stories to make sense every step of the way . This one , at least at the start , seems like a mystery coiled up in another mystery about how the bar-codes work , how they figure into the detective ( s ) and what Lucy has to do with it all , and Amamiya / Kobayashi's partner , and so on , which can be a little frustrating . However , if you love how much of a wild-man Miike can get with already subversive material , MPPsycho is for ardent fans and casual admirers a trippy concoction where science fiction , film-noir , and the aforementioned Magna combine somewhat into a sweet mini-series event . As groundbreaking as TP ? Not quite , but it's a lot of fun watching Miike create silly myth and disturbing subversion all the same .
A thrilling crime film , in deep touch and care with the characters - Besson and Portman's best work to date	I sensed that Luc Besson ( director of The Fifth Element and La Femme Nikita ) was , like Tarantino and many , many others before him , borrowed elements from various films and genres to create their own voice in the film . With Leon , I sensed him alluding to the crime films of France ( i . e . Melville ) , Hong-Kong ( i . e . Woo ) , and America ( i . e . Scorsese ) , and making it into his own special brand for the story and characters . That his style visually is as compelling helps a great deal . The international version ( which is the one I saw ) is a little grittier , and more suggestive , than the version most American audiences saw in 1994 and on cable . But it is also a must-see if you are planning to see the film . It's not a long movie , though it gives a good many details in its story . Jean Reno has his star-making turn ( at least for what he's worth ) in Leon - he's ruthless contract killer who will kill just about anyone for the right price . He lives out of an apartment by himself , trying his best to ignore his noisy neighbors . One of the daughters is Mathilda ( Natalie Portman , also a major breakthrough performance ) , abused by her whole family to no end . When a corrupt cop ( Gary Oldman , one of the key villain performances of his career along with Dracula and Drexl in True Romance ) goes and kills off her family while she's away , she has no one else to turn to besides the reclusive killer . She knows what he does , and she wants in . The rest of the film is about their relationship , as it unfolds professionally and emotionally , leading to a tremendous , bloody climax . One thing that struck me most about Leon is the fact that the film was more disturbing than I expected . The idea of a killer getting a pupil in a young teenage girl is unusual enough , but the way it unfolds I felt so much for her plight got to me at times . this doesn't make Leon a tear-jerker ( maybe for some , I'm not sure ) , but because of Portman's dead-on portrayal , it makes the story work somehow , and is in a way as fantastical as it is naturalistic . There are also a few scenes that stuck out as being little masterpieces of all the elements coming together . The first is a brief scene , and crucial to showing the character of Leon early on - he takes a break after his contract , and sees a movie , a musical with Gene Kelly . He's the only one in the theater , and he is completely in the grasp of what he sees on the screen . It's the perfect touch of humanity and shows his only escape is into complete fantasy . The second is when Leon and Mathilda are in a restaurant , after she has just gone through a day of training ( there's a hilarious montage that follows this scene ) . Mathilda is getting drunk off of champagne , rambling with words she may or may not mean . Suddenly , she starts laughing , and she laughs more , and harder . People in the restaurant look at her like she's nuts . Leon is , of course , embarrassed . However , I thought this was just the right touch to this scene , where the kind of father-daughter relationship going on between Leon and Mathilda is revealed . It's not exactly funny , not even really cringe worthy . It just is . The third scene is when Mathilda decides to pay a visit to the man who murdered her family . She follows the man into the bathroom , and waits . Suddenly , he ( Oldman ) appears out from behind a door . The language used , the tenseness of the two off of one another , it's simply the most terrifying scene in the picture ( aside from the first violent turning point ) . So , basically , when Leon finished , I think I realized that my reaction was this : if I had seen this film when I was younger , be it in high school or even middle school , I would've responded to it even more strongly than I do now . There's something very visceral about the nature of violence and killing , as well as the mentor / pupil relationship , that Besson really gets down pat . While some of the situations have the chance of slipping into clichés , it doesn't happen very often . Leon : The Professional , is hard-hitting when it has to be , soft and funny when it can , and does stay with the viewer a few days after it's over .
Definitely the best film ever made , or at least the most shockingly effective	Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange is a great film , but also stubbornly so , to the point where you have to either like it or dis-like it ( as Pauline Kael said , it's from the mind of a ' mad German filmmaker mind ' , ho-ho ) . It looks into the human ways like never before ( rarely since as funny or questioningly ) in the style that only Kubrick could do . Even though it was banned from the UK and Australia , the controversy isn't compromised . The writing , direction and acting is at it's highest peak form and just when you think it couldn't get better , it gets to be the best . Also , the breakthrough performance of Malcolm McDowell gets him at the top of the British actors list in my book ( this performance most likely got him noticed in the film world ) . And all the elements surrounding him makes it perfect . Finally , the themes are terrific . The way the film shows how the government screws a regular fiend over is great . The film is provoking , if nothing else , which is what most of the great films should do , and it's my personal favorite from Kubrick .
