Incoherent drivel	" Smithereens " is the kind of worthless flick which just hangs out among the cable channels taking up space like a cheesy dime novel in the public library . A worthless bit of tripe and first effort for mediocre director Seidelman , the film is fraught with bad acting , bad sound , bad camera work , and poor quality in all aspects of the film . Many better films never make it to market and why junk flicks like this one do and never seem to go away is one of life's great mysteries . (
PU ! What stinks ?	Oh , it's this stupid movie I'm watching . A terrible film making effort , " Ivory Tower " fails at just about every level as it tries to take us into the world of hi-tech electronics , industrial espionage , and life , love and sex in the corporate environs of Silicon Valley . Pick something . . . casting , sets , screenplay , music , script , acting . . . etc . , etc . . . all awful , amateurish , boring , naive , tedious . . . etc . , etc . There really isn't anything good I can say about this film except someone managed to get it into production and it does have a couple of decent actors in it ; Ironside and Wurher . PU !
Just good enough to be awful .	" Ripe " is one of those awful indies which manages to get into circulation and give indies a bad name . Telling a stupidly incongruous tale of pubescent twin sisters who crawl from a firey car crash which kills their parents and then hit the road while happily shoplifting , making goo-goo eyes at some guy , and ending up on an Army post so dilapidated no Army would want it ( yeah , right ! ) . An apparent attempt at a coming of age flick , " Ripe " is an almost complete loser which wanders aimlessly as the players drift in and out of character finally ending clumsily with nary a shred of credibility to be found anywhere . Not recommended for anyone .
Bottom gun .	" . . . Black Angel " pretty much just sucks . There are too many deficits to go into detail . The only reason to watch would be the flying and it's pretty ordinary . . . . snap rolls are about it . The story is lame and the execution worse with poor if any technical advice . Only for hard up sofa spuds who love aerial combat dog fights . ( D )
Well , at least the camera was in focus .	" Lockdown " is a pathetic attempt at film making with a litany of deficits too long for this forum . The film fails in everything from over-acting to silly stereotypically characters to awful directing to . . . . etc . Not recommendable for anyone for any reason . ( D )
The harsh reality of Hollywood .	Many good films have been made about the American / Vietnamese conflict from the sensationalistic and unpretentious " Apocalypse Now " to many serious minded documentaries about the harsh reality of the war . " We Were Soldiers " is not one of them . A pretentious retelling of the first major American engagement with the Vietnamese on the battlefield ( circa 1965 ) , the film is one contrived , obvious , and fabricated scene after another from crying because you lived and your men didn't ( a success for a field commander ) to coming home unannounced ( yeah , right ) to a feeble attempt to honor the Vietnamese warriors , etc . etc . etc . This flick is blatant commercialism under the guise of patriotism and a poor tribute to the fighting men and women who sacrificed during the Vietnam conflict . The only thing sadder than the mentality behind " We Were Soldiers " is the mentality that supported it at the box office and in critical reviews . (
I've never seen such a good cast in such a bad film	" More Dogs Than Bones " is a comedy about some crooked cash which gets so doggone lost that no one can find it . Supposed to be a comedy , this dog stumbles clumsily along with a monotonous storyline punctuated with some comic relief which is so bad the only relief is when the film ends . How so many good actors could end up in such an awful film is beyond all reason . Pass on this puppy . (
Mediocre teen flick	" Save the Last Dance " is an ill focused teen drama about a white high school girl who moves into a black ghetto after her mother dies . There she is awakened by her love interest and inspired to be all she can be and realize her dream . This wandering , simple-minded slice of life flick doesn't show us anything new and does a poor job of showing us old stuff . " Save . . . " fails as a love story , a dance flick for either hip-hop or ballet , and doesn't even make a convincing drama . Most likely to be appreciated by teen females but not recommended for anyone .
All this movie needs is a good director . . .	and story and screenplay . " South of Heaven . . . " is a colossal flop but not for want of talent . Something like The Wild Bunch meets The Keystone Cops , this flick can't make up it's mind what it wants to be . With all the makings of a good period drama , " South . . . " wanders aimlessly into farce , staggers around in comedy , teeters in the action genre , and falls on its face dying a slow and painful death from lack of a story and substance . Obviously staged and scripted with an unnatural ebb and flow , terrible segues , and poor continuity , " South . . . " is an obvious collection of brain farts strung together into one of the worst films I've seen in a long time .
Too much about too little	A tour de force by Bratt , " Pinero " tells the story of NYC dwelling drug addict , poet , jail bird , playwright , thief , and actor Miguel Pinero in a busy cacophony of sight and sound which trades kinetics and verve for content , clarity , and humanity . In short , the flick plays out like just another screwed up junkie artist bio which doesn't crawl into the Pinero head to flush out the questionable humanity of the enigmatic protagonist . A film with limited appeal , low entertainment value , and poor coherence . (
Simple minded tripe in a slick wrapper	" The Learning Curve " tells an obvious and naive tale about a couple of young scammers who scam their way to the top . The film is an okay shoot with some decent acting talent , most notably Kidman look-alike Mazur . However , " TLC " fails in story and substances as it wends it way though a series of obvious contrivances fleshing out characters who little more than shallow mannequins while appearing to dig for depth but never finding it . Not likely to have appeal beyond a niche teen audience . ( D )
Just more of the same	" Maximum Risk " is a step sideways for Van Damme and just more of the uninspired B-movie action stuff we've come to expect from films featuring the macho Belgian martial artist . The flick has gaping plots holes , goofs galore , a messy conglomerated plot , and a gorgeous Henstridge who spends most of her time looking like she's waiting for a cue . " Maximum Risk " doesn't distinguish itself in any way and will likely not have much appeal beyond the usual young male audiences . (
Dumb . . . but I laughed .	" Sour Grapes " tells of two guys , cousins , who are best friends until one loans / gives the other two quarters which go into a slot machine with a half million dollar payoff . They win and the feud over how to split the jackpot sets off a series of silly situational setups . " Sour Grapes " has little going for it . Even the comedy is somewhat hackneyed and dumb . Nonetheless , I laughed . . . but then I like dumb humor . Not recommendable but might be worth a peek for those who like silly , dumb sitcoms .
An amusing journeyman gangster flick for channel surfers	" Thick as Thieves " follows a crafty professional thief ( Baldwin ) as he does a job , gets ripped off , and seeks retribution . The result involves cops , black and Italian mobs , and the thief all trying to resolve the situation in accordance with their respective agendas . A slightly above average watch , this journeyman gangster flick is all Hollywood light drama , mildly entertaining , more amusing than serious , and good fodder for channel surfers .
Over done	" A Brother's Kiss " tells of two brothers who grow up in the mean streets of NYC and take opposite paths through life still bound by brotherly love through thick and thin . A strong performance by Chinlund ( one of those where - have - I - seen - that - guy - before actors ) is the glue which holds this overwrought freak show of cliche stereotypical characters together . The film serves up 20 minutes of the bro's as kids and then skips ahead to adult life where we see one as a cop and the other as a good intentioned loser with a habit . " . . . Kiss " sports a good cast and crew but doesn't live up to its potential because of a story we've all seen before and poor direction leading to overwrought drama . Every scene plays out like an excuse for exaggerated characters and over acting making this film a good example of that most common of all faults of the novice artist - not knowing when to quit . " Real " would have been better and less would have been more . (
Would you like a little testosterone with your popcorn ?	" Back in Business " tells of a ex-cop who teams up with his ex-partner to make a drug bust and . . . well , fix everything else which is wrong with his little corner of the world . A marginal action flick at best , " BinB " has very ordinary stunts and action sequences replete with all the usual machine gun wielding heavies ; a sexless love relationship between the hero and delicious Dara ; and lots of fun macho banter between Bosworth and his partner . If the film has anything at all going for it , it's the sort of dumb charm of square jawed and ruggedly handsome Bosworth's character who is trying to get in touch with his feminine side and control his anger with the help of his talk-radio psychotherapist while clumsily stumbling into the action spotlight and settling old scores . An okay no brainer for action junkies only .
A silly French sitcom with a whole lot of subtitles .	" French Twist " is a mildly humorous situational comedy about an attractive women , wife , and mother who is married to a womanizer who becomes outraged when his wife falls in with a dyke . From there , the story turns into a series of who-has-the-upper-sexual-hand situations . The film , with more flaws than favors , is dialogue-intensive and probably not worth all the subtitle reading for those who don't speak French .
Subpar cop show	" Ihaka : Blunt Instrument " is all about Ihaka ( Morrison ) , a New Zealand no nonsense macho Maori cop with a penchant for taking matters into his own hands and solving problems with his fists . In this installment he his shipped off to Australia where he teams up with a beautiful desk jockey cop ( Gibney ) and together they go off to solve a murder . A banal , mediocre effort , this film suffers from stiff performances from the two leads , a sophomoric script , an unimaginative storyline , and more . What the minds behind the film wanted is obvious but what they deliver is a second rate waste of acting talent . Recommended for Aussies , Kiwi's , Maori's , and others with an interest in the regional TV fare . ( C ) Note - Morrison's powerful performance in " Once Were Warriors " is evidence of potential which is wasted in " Ihaka " .
Nothing new	In the grand scheme of martial arts movies , " Tai Chi II " ( not a sequel ) is junk . However , for martial arts enthusiasts it might qualify as a B-flick . A sort of dramady about a young Chinese puritan student who wants to win the affections of a hottie while ridding his land of the evils of opium , this flick breaks no new ground as it finds one excuse after another for Wu to do all the same old tired Kung Fu moves we seen a gazillion times before . . . with the exception using his braid like a whip ( yeah , right ) . Save some pretty scenery including Chung and identifying some of the Tai Chi position used during the fight ( eg : leaping lizard , holy cow , etc . ) , this flick is pure cornball Kung Fu with the same sound effect used for every punch , missed-by-a-mile choreography , and lame wire fu . Lacking the grit of Bruce Lee , the inventiveness and personality of Jackie Chan , and the elegance of " Crouching Tiger . . . " , " Tai Chi II " is just more junk food for martial art film freaks . ( C )
More evidence Polanski is overrated .	" Bitter Moon " is yet another example that Polanski has made more lemons than lemonade . Telling of a married couple on an ocean voyage who happen upon another couple which invigles them into ridiculous behavior by spinning an equally ridiculous yarn , this tiring soap opera quality flick will wear you out with its monotonous 2 . 2 hour run . A shabby film which opens with a curious situation , the carrot , which keeps you watching though a seemingly endless succession of flashbacks narrated with horribly sophomoric prose , " Bitter Moon " proves many things . . . such as Seigner can't dance and Polanski still hasn't mastered the art of keeping his characters in character . As ashamed as I am to say it , the best thing in the flick from my perspective is all the Seigner skin . At least - it - isn't blatant fraud . ( C )
Nothing special	" Daddy and Me " takes a look at a dysfunctional Arkansas family of ignorant hicks with Thornton and Dern out front as a couple with issues . A sort of slice - of - dysfunctional - family - life flick which pours over a good cast of oddball characters , this comedy doesn't manage to conjure up anything of significance except a whole lot of Thornton's trailer park trash home spun situational comedy / drama " home cookin ' " . " Daddy and Them " offers plenty of familiar faces cranking out solid performances , but everything else from concept to completion is about as dysfunctional as the characters . For Thornton fans only . ( C )
I think nine months is the run time .	" Nine Months " is a chick flick romcom about a happily unmarried couple ( Moore & Grant ) who gets preggo and , well , has a baby . A big step down for kid flick director Chris Columbus , this tumble from messy to sappy to corny to slapsticky wouldn't be worth the time if it weren't for the comic contributions of Arnold , Williams , Cusack , and Goldblum . Moore ( Shoulda been Sophie Marceau ) seems uncomfortably out of place while Grant hams it up dutifully ( stiff upper lip and all that ) as the film becomes increasingly in need of creative substance slogging its way toward its sentimental conclusion . No brainer fluff stuff for young female sofa spuds . (
Too little , too late	" Run of the Country " tells of the coming of age of a young Irish man , recently bereaved of his mother , living with his martinet father , and falling in love with a girl from the other Ireland . A solid production on most counts , the film delivers too little too late in story making for a meandering watch lacking cohesion . Okay fodder for sentimentalists best saved for tv . (
An above average thriller / horror flick .	Although it falls well short of anything by Poe or Hitchcock , " Final Destination " is somewhat more intelligent than most films of this genre . Apparently targeting the usual teen market , this commercial thriller gets off to a good start , then lags a bit as it wallows in the usual blood and guts , and finishes somewhat better . Sawa does a good job of not over acting , supporting acting is on par , and the special effects seem almost believable . Most of all , the nemesis is never really defined which gives this film a somewhat unique mystique .
No Way !	" No Way Back " sticks FBI agent Crowe in the middle of a crude conglomeration of assorted Mafia weirdos , FBI agents , cops , Yakuza , and an airline flight attendant in its attempt to mix action with attitude and tongue-in-cheek humor . The result is a messy plot which accomplishes little save lurching from one mediocre action scene to the next . An okay no brainer for insomniacs .
A mediocre drama with little to offer and no payoff .	" Went . . . " , a downer drama with a spritz of humor , tells the tale of two of a trio of young men who grew up together in school days off to Coney Island in search of their wayward , homeless comrad . The story proceeds in preset day using interleaved flashbacks in a clumsy attempt to develop characters and story and trite aphorisms to lend credence to a weak plot with no payoff . The film has poor technical execution , the look of a super 8mm shoot , bad makeup , and general mediocrity in art , acting , and directing and conjures up more sympathy for the actors than the characters . Very forgettable .
Die now and spare us the ZZzzzzz	In " I'll Sleep When I Die " is about a loner ( Owen ) , living out of his van in the boonies while dealing with the issues of his checkered past , who must return to London to find out why his brother committed suicide and tie up the loose ends of revenge . This clumsy film seems to take forever to pull together the bits and pieces of its thin plot and when it does , the rest of the film is a foregone conclusion . The human story is as weak and contrived as one would expect from an action flick while the action is almost nonexistent making the body of the film an empty mess of nothingness moving like molasses . Very ordinary , uninspired , and poorly directed . Not worthy of further commentary . A looser . ( C )
A lukewarm telling of a true spy story .	" The Impossible Spy " is a so-so spy flick and docudrama which tells of renowned Israeli spy Eli Cohen and his penetration of the Syrian government in the years prior to the Six Days War . The film has the look of a low budget indie and , though it's well meaning and earnest , it is not a very elegant flick . Furthermore , much of the story seems too obvious to be real spy stuff which probably just means it's true . Recommended for those into spy flicks or the history of the Syrian / Israel conflict of the 1960's .
Good start , lousy finish .	" The Magic of Marciano " begins as a rock solid journeyman drama about a boy ( Morgan ) , trying to cope with an emotionally unstable working class single mom ( Kinski ) and her abusive boyfriend , who finds a friend in an older man ( Forster ) . As the film wears on , however , it takes a nose dive as Barbieri begins replaying scenes with two different outcomes , apparently in a feeble and annoying attempt to show the boy's fantasies , only to crash and burn with an unsatisfying conclusion and poor resolution . An okay watch for fans of the players but when taken as a whole little more than a mediocre small screen watch . ( C )
Cute , light hearted , and amusing stuff free on cable .	" Hi-LIfe " tells of a NYC corner pub and the antics of numerous young adults associated with it . . . a sort of " Cheers " kind of " feel " . The plot : He needs to pay off a bookie . His girl friend tells her bro she's preggo and needs the money for an abortion . The bro begin calling in old debts from old friends . . . etc , etc , etc . With a Christmas time in NYC ambiance , a good cast of second tier actors , and a clever plot , " Hi-Life " has much going for it . Unfortunately , it plays like a tv sitcom with only a modicum of entertainment and a script below the level of the acting talent . Enjoyable stuff for the terminally bored but no sex , nudity , love story , or hilarity .
Romantic epic wannabe	" Head in the Clouds " , set in Paris ( circa 1920's-1940's ) , is all about a trio of three characters ; two women and one man . The centerpiece of the trio and the film is Theron as an independent , capricious , liberal and free spirited women who is in love with both her male and female part-time companions ( Townsend & Cruz ) who , in turn , both love her . The film follows the ebb and flow of the trio's relationships from their good times before the Spanish civil war through their bad times during WWII . An attempt at a sort of romantic epic , " Head in the Clouds " is wrought with staginess , corny dialogue , charming artificiality , and glorified melodrama . Not well received by the critics , this obvious film seems to be trying too hard while never quite ringing true . Should be an okay watch for romantics and sentimentalists . (
Good butt kickin ' fun .	" The Scorpion King " tells of a desert assassin ( the hero ) , his reluctant comic-relief buddy , his trusty camel , a luscioius sorceress , a gigantus black warlord dude , an army of barbarous babes , cute theif / kid , and an old alchemist who take on a desert bastion to rid the kingdom of the people's scourge , a wicked king who catches arrows and probably picks on old ladies and kids too . No brainer action entertainment which you can leave to go get a beer without missing anything important except maybe " The Rock's " eyebrow thing , this flick is a fun not-to-be-taken-seriously diversion with a sense of humor worth a look by action junkies who aren't going to get all up tight and analytical . Fun stuff , no more , no less . (
The preeminent chick flick .	Though more cerebral than most chick flicks , " Things . . . " is all about women and women's issues . A plaintive and sometimes quirky look into a handful of female lives , this film is shot as several vignettes connected by one or two cross-over characters . Lacking in substance and story , " Things . . . " relies heavily on a cadre of fine actors , a script which is a tad surreal , and the voyeuristic inclinations of the audience . A good watch for female couch potatoes .
Mediocre serial killer stuff	In " Postmortem " , Sheen plays a burnt out ex homicide detective from San Francisco who , while hiding from his past in Scotland and booze , gets caught up in a serial killer mystery . The flick is okay artistically though at times so ponderously morose and dark as to have the appearance of an old Frankenstein flick . Sheen wears out the one serious expression in his repertoire of nuanced visages ; taught lipped and frowning . The flick doesn't quite make it over the bar on major plot issues such as the spent cop dealing with demons ; the investigation becomes a bit convoluted ; and the ending is predictable , anticlimactic , and could have been better . Etc . Nonetheless , " Postmortem " makes for an okay watch for Sheen fans , serial killers , and the idle with an appetite for macabre stuff .
A well staged gritty kidnap flick with limited appeal .	" The Way of the Gun " is a gritty , messy , bloody , dark kidnap B-flick in which the entire cast of characters is somewhere between wanton and downright evil . The film's plot is a twisty-turny convoluted kind of mess which asks more questions than it answers and may interest or even seduce viewers with an appetite for blood and guts crime films . The shootout scenes are fairly well staged , the script waxes philosophical in an ambiguous sort of way , and the movie does sort itself out in the end . Certainly not for everyone , this peculiar flick will find an audience among those with an appetite for the bizarre .
Beautifully boring	" Till Human Voices Wake Us " tells two parallel stories at the same time , interleaving scenes . The first is of a man ( Pearce ) returning to his boyhood home in Australia to bury his father and , with the help of a mysterious woman ( Bonham Carter ) , bittersweet memories of his childhood . The second story shows us the boy and the events which created the memories which haunt the man . Beautifully filmed but tediously told and wholly unsatisfying , this lovely bit of tripe treads the paranormal having left itself nowhere else to go . (
When will they learn ?	After two big " El Mariachi " hits and earning the credibility and respect to command the big bucks , Rodriguez does what so many before him have done and cranks up the volume to numbing excess driving the audience into sensory overload while breaching the point where more becomes less and running what could have been a great action flick into the ground . " Once Upon a Time in Mexico " wastes a fine cast and high end state-of-the-art production on a jumbled , convoluted mess of a movie . Bandaras , hero and " El Mariachi " , is buried in a sea of drug cartel heavies , military , agents , innocents , etc . while Hayek only has a few lines and is relegated to a handful of flashbacks . More is not always more , smarter is better than harder , and you can't force creativity . When will they learn ? For diehard action junkies only . (
A jolly good romp amongst English gentry .	The arranged marriage of an English aristocrat's daughter goes awry befuddling all concerned in this well made and lighthearted comedy . An unpretentious little film , " Clandestine Marriage " serves up an ample portion of good old English comedy and quits while it's ahead .
A nominal , romanticized lite drama .	" Feast . . . " is a well crafted , somewhat staged and romanticized drama about a woman , Bella ( Davidtz ) , who wanders into the lives of a 19th century agrarian English family with 3 adult sons changing their lives forever . The film offers good performances by all , represents rural life of the time well , is artfully presented , and avoids extreme excursions giving the film a sort of perfect Disney-esque feel . Davidtz graces the screen throughout though Chaplin offers perhaps the best performance . A good watch for those in need of some easy-going romantic period drama .
Simple minded , monotonous , redundant , and disappointing .	" Fraility " is 70 minutes of Bill Paxton whacking people with an ax in the name of God while his young son's watch . The balance of the film is the setup in the beginning and the twisty-turny stuff at the end . There's little suspense , few thrills , and almost no action leaving just so much plodding , stoic , and somewhat monotonous drama full of redundant whacking and God-talk . Overall " Fraility " is a moody flick with somber atmospherics , good art and technicals , okay acting , etc . but don't expect much of a story . Over-rated but worth a look for those into horrific dramas . (
A gem of a sleeper from down-under .	" Soft Fruit " is a bittersweet Aussie flick about a terminally ill mother who summons her adult children to her bedside for her final days . Anything but a downer , this cross-genre flick shows us humor , poignancy , and quirkiness as we watch a barely functional and functional barely family deal with the passing of its matriarch . An enjoyable film , a critics darling , and a winner of some fringe awards , " Soft Fruit " is a worthwhile watch for those into flicks about working class Aussies .
Lug nuts and wing nuts coming unscrewed	" Changing Lanes " tells of two men ( Affleck & Jackson ) who get into it on an expressway where their road rage turns into a day of dirty tricks and self examination . " CL " toys with the timeless opposition of idealism and pragmatism while awkwardly tiptoeing through a misanthropic reality where everyone seems to be subjugated by the system , the establishment , only to come to grips with reality in the end . Somewhat trite , the film does deal with matters of principal , is stylish with a good cast ( Affleck excepted ) , and moves along quick enough that its many departures from the real world are easily overlooked . An okay watch for those into films about character . (
No cure for AD	" Edges of the Lord " tells of a young Jewish boy ( Osment ) who is sent to live in a rural village in Poland to escape the holocaust where he is schooled in Christianity by the local priest ( Dafoe ) and falls in with a group of pre and post pubescent kids . Full of filler and painfully slow moving at times , there's little meat on the bones of this film which gathers momentum past the halfway mark with some dramatic elements including a rape and a showdown with Nazis . However , the drama is underdone , too little too late . and poorly integrated . Most will find " Edges of the Lord " too slow . However , sentimentalists and others who can make the buy-in to this marginal story of children surviving under the pall of war will find the film an entertaining watch . Recommended for hanky ringers , sentimentalists , and others into films about children . (
A flawed pic with a good heart and sense of humor .	" Mixing Nia " tells of a " color blind " half black , half white New York City career woman who wrestles with her identity in a race conscious world . A light drama with " low budget indie " written all over it , " Mixing Nia " is flawed but manages a nominally good story , screenplay , and script . A little flick whose heart is in the right place and a good stop for channel surfers .
Melodrama without the melo	" Unhook the Stars " is all about Rowlands who plays a middle aged widow with grown kids who wakes up one day to find herself no longer needed as a wife and mother . An uneventful and even character study which builds enough interest in the Rowlands character to make it not too difficult to overlook her supporting cast who play obvious stereotypes , " Unhook . . . " is a flick with no punchline which plays like a meal with no dessert . The entertainment is in the ride , not the destination . A good slice of mature life flick worth a look .
This flick makes you wonder if the film makers ever went to college .	" Higher Learning " is a predictable and contrived handful of college campus stereotypes all involved in worst case scenarios on the same campus at the same time with little purpose . The film explores such issues as partying and date rape , tuition and academic problems , social problems , gangs , frats , etc . all with the usual Hollywood phony excesses . Not a thinking person's movie , this film will appeal to the couch potatoe's appetite for sensationalism .
The Xander Zone if for the loading and unloading of teen boys only	" XXX " is an extension of the nominally successful male juvi exploitation flick " Fast and Furious " with the bald ugly guy with muscles on his tattoos playing a secret agent who's out to save the planet from your average " Dr . Evil " nemesis while impressing the hell out of babe-alicious Argento . A sort of " Bond for babies " , " XXX " parallels every 007 movie ever made with eXtreme action in lieu of class , finesse , and sophistication . Among the countless flaws are a bad guy who seems nicer than the hero ; a missed op to zoom in on Argento's angel tat ; and Diesel sucking face with the Italian diva which totally grossed me out . For kids only . (
Sometimes you just gotta go with it .	" Happy Times " , a small time comedy out of China , tells of a less than successful middle-aged man who is desperately seeking a wife and finds a " daughter " instead . A lilting and sweetly sentimental comedy , this flick has a quirky kind of charm which defies description . I personally became completely bewitched by the film's simple , fresh , and unique style . But I suspect I'm the exception . " Happy Times " will most likely offer some happy time for sentimental viewers into neo-Chinese cinema exports . (
Whatever	" XX / XY " is a relationship flick about an FFM trio of young adults who become close , drift apart , and then rediscover each other years later only to find their reunion raises issues about mate selection . The film is a naive drone of chick flick yammering which fleshes out the core characters superficially leaving the audience to marginally engaged voyeurism . It does , however , paint a somewhat realistic picture of the trade-offs life requires as opposed to wandering into romantic fantasyland . An okay drama-lite for the less than middle-age crowd . (
For voyeurs only	" What Time Is It Over There " is a laconic study of three characters : A man hawking wrist watches on the streets of Taipei ; his widowed mourning mother obsessed with her late husband's spiritual return ; and a Taiwanese babe who goes to Paris after trying to buy his watch . The camera of this virtually scriptless flick methodically follows these characters as we get to know them simply by watching what they do - none of which is very interesting . To the extent the audience can " feel " their pain and loneliness , this film has something to offer . However , I suspect most filmgoers will quickly lose interest in this slow moving , uneventful , peculiar , minimalistic art flick with little to offer . For voyeurs , arthouse film devotees , critics , and dilettantes . (
Missing something	Oliver Parker's " The Importance of Being Earnest " seems only worthy to the extent that it embodies the epigrammatic genius of Wilde the playwright . To the extent that it embodies Parker's own ideas and translation to film , it is all downhill . The result is a reasonably enjoyable watch which is missing something - perhaps a combination of things such as tempo and timing , a touch of class , a sense of authenticity , etc . The film does make annoying excursions into the surreal , the music is overstated , and the casting questionable . Regardless , the film is worth a look by Wilde enthusiasts and others interested in Brit period flicks . All others should pass on this one . (
The final farewell	" Homicide : The Movie " is a TV flick which continues the defunct TV series and , given its less than sterling reviews , probably concludes it as well . The film , which tells of the investigation of a shooting of a Baltimore mayoral candidate who also heads the homicide squad ( Kotto ) , pulls together most of the cast of the successful 1993-1999 TV series with reprises from many including cameos from the dead characters . " Homicide : The Movie " requires such a familiarity with the TV series for a complete understanding of the characters ' background and history that familiarity with the series is almost a prerequisite for the film . Furthermore , as a stand alone piece , the film just isn't that good . " Homicide : The Movie " will play best as a farewell to loyal viewers of " Homicide : Life in the Streets " . (
Dead and buried in Hollywood	" To Live and Die in L . A . " tells of a T-Man who will stop at nothing to settle a score with a counterfeiter ( Dafoe ) who murdered his partner . A moody and very Hollywoodish action / drama , this film does little to distinguish itself , save one very good car chase , and plays out like just another cop vs bad guy movie . Petersen is too generic and vanilla and acts like a hyperactive Secret Service agent on meth . Funny money freak Dafoe is too stereotypical and acts like he's trying to be the personification of evil on ludes . The story is flawed with plot holes aplenty and obvious histrionics and the principal protag Petersen is too bad to be good , leaving the audience with no one to root for . Nonetheless , this flick received excellent reviews from critics with Ebert giving it a top four stars . Personally I couldn't remember anything about the film after 20 years , though I have vivid recollections of Friedkin's earlier " French Connection " . " Live & Die . . . " is fodder for TV action junkies but too old to be state-of-the-art and not good enough to be a classic . Watchable but passable . (
Good stuff with narrow appeal .	" The Royal Tenenbaums " tells of a disenfranchised aging patriarch's ( Hackman ) attempt to reclaim his dysfunctional family of peculiar , self-absorbed , laconic , and idiosyncratic people . A meandering brut farce , the film sports an excellent cast and good technicals and art . However , it's peculiar nature is just enough off center to make any emotional buy-in impossible and just enough near center to make more than an occasional tongue in cheek unlikely . " TRT " is fodder for film buffs , dilettantes , and critics and will likely receive a lukewarm reception from the public at large . Just more proof that creative is not necessarily good . B-Note : I rented the DVD but couldn't find anyone else in my household to watch it . Caricatures are easy but portraits are difficult . This is a film of Caricatures .
Critical mess	" 24 Hour Party People " is another film which reaches critical mess with a vast chasm between the salivating film critics and a dumbfounded public . A very smart docudrama about a very boring subject with an even more boring , trite , and conceited story , " 24 Hour . . . . " follows Coogan through the genesis of a Manchester , England punk band ( sort of ) . Bottom line here is , if you never heard of Joy Division , New Order , Factory Records , or Tony Wilson then you probably won't care about this film . I don't listen to punk , never attended a rave , etc . and was pretty much bored through-out the film . It's clever quirkiness ( sheep herding goose , poisoned pigeons , etc ) is the only thing which kept me awake and mildly amused . For 24 hour party people only . (
What'd you expect , " Citizen Kane " . . . duh .	" Head Over Heels " , a slight cut above the usual teen romantic comedy in creativity while rather ordinary in execution , is a fun little romp with Prinze and Potter trying to get together amidst constant clashes of interest including a gaggle of super model roomies on Potters ' side and a gurgle of nefarious dudes on Prinze's side . Toss in a dog which loves to try to hump Potter ( understandable ) , some sharpshooting dagger throwing , a little potty humor , skullduggery , pratfalls , and other nonsense and you have a lively little no brainer for those who don't take this genre too seriously .
Ah yes ! Feel the boredom , the monotony , the tedium !	Many films , most rather bland by cinematic standards , have been made about the antics of idle rich Brits living abroad estranged from their homeland during the days of WWII . Though most such films have dealt with Italy's Tuscany area ( specifically Lake Como ) , " White Mischief " is another such flick which slogs tediously through seemingly endless moments of uppercrusty decadence until finally and almost reluctantly getting around to . . . drum roll , please . . . the Murder ! Telling a true story which is not even a footnote of a footnote in African history , this long on talent and short on story flick conjures up too little , too late . A mediocre watch at best which will be most appreciated by those into period dramas about Brits abroad .
A heart warming musing on a century of black experience in America	" Having Our Say " brings new meaning to " coming of age " as it tells the story of two black American sisters , both 100 + years old . Carroll and Dee make a delightful centerpiece for this film which , through a series of flashbacks , recounts their growing up and growing old in a racially divided America . A highly sanitized film , " Having . . . " is a light hearted reflection on the black experience .
A low cal , mildly entertaining version of an old story .	" 28 days " is a superficial and not-too-serious mix of comedy , snappy dialogue , superficial dramatic excursions , a minimal cast , and the only persona in Bullock's repertoire with the serious drug abuse / rehab subject . Some will find this drama-lite film entertaining in spite of its numerous short comings . Others will feel is doesn't do justice to the issues .
An excellent production of a tediously told tale .	" Moll Flanders " ( 1996 ) tells the tale of a young woman's struggle with life in 18th century England . This film received mixed reviews from both critics and consumers for obvious reasons . Everything about the film is good except the telling of the story . In spite of all the pluses , Moll Flanders trudges so stoically through her ordinary life as to not whet the edge of the viewers interest but rather make a wonderfully produced film a tedious and boring watch punctuated with poignant moments barely sufficient to keep the waning eyelid open .
If you love ballet , you'll enjoy this film . If not , not .	" The Company " is about a season with the Joffrey Ballet company . That's it . That sums it up . You'll get to see bits and pieces of ballet stuff , large and small , behind the scenes and before the audiences with full-on glorious , spectacular , sumptuous , heady colorful productions replete with all the usual leaping around . You'll come to learn that ballet dancers are people too and shoot pool and bum condoms and snap tendons and schmooz and hang out and drill and drill and drill some more . What you won't see is any semblance of a plot or story . Just ballet stuff . Lots and lots of ballet stuff . So , if you love ballet stuff , " The Company " is for you . But if you're like me and think ballet is kind of gay , you may want to watch NASCAR or rassling or something . ( B )
Darkish , gritty , bloody escapist flick	" Killing Zoe " , a misnomer , is all about a bank robbery in Paris . A gritty action / drama directed / written by " Reservoir Dogs " and " True Romance " writer Avary , the film begins as hyper-realism as it pulls its components together and wanders into a mostly sensationalistic blood bath which borders on overkill . Protagonists Delphy and Stoltz play people of questionable character but manage to give the film a taste of honey . Okay escapist entertainment with little plot and purpose for action junkies .
What a waste	Stone's " Alexander " tries to tell the story of one of the great military leaders and conquerors of all time who is to this day , some 2300 years later , is still studied in military war colleges . Unfortunately the film tries too hard to do too much resulting in three hours of jumping around in time trying desperately to show us the man and his human story while carrying on great expeditionary campaigns at the same time . With insufficient didactics , overzealous theatrics , and the esoterics of the time , the film becomes nothing less than a numbing mess . Listening to Stone's director's cut one gets the impression he had a clear vision of what he wanted to accomplish with his well researched historical epic . One also gets the impression he made the movie for himself . Lacking in coherence , muddled and messy , " Alexander " is a classic example of what happens when one ventures too deep into that creative territory where less is more resulting in a spectacular flop . (
Full frontal lobotomy	" Session 9 " which takes us into the innersanctum of an isolated sanatorium with a crew who is there to remove asbestos but gets more than they bargained for . The film deserves credit for offering a good cast and crew resulting in a superficially good product . However , the screenplay , which asks more questions than it answers , distills to a clutter of busy work and peculiar happenings which aren't particularly horrific or thrilling . When all is said and done , I was left cold , yawning , and confused . Chalk this one up to just another good effort which didn't pan out . Best saved for broadcast . (
There are better movies to be made .	" Things . . . " , not unlike " Pulp Fiction " , is a stylish , imaginative , and preposterous love-it-or-hate-it crime noir drama full of comic book caricature characters with a story bordering on the ridiculous . In retrospect , one should ask the sterling cast of actors and excellent production staff one simple question . Didn't you all have something better to do with your time and talent ? ? In retrospect , if they are honest , the answer would likely be a unanimous " yes " . As good as some may think " Things . . . " is , there are better movies to be made .
A highly stylized but tedious film .	" Winter Sleepers " is a thin story about some ordinary people in some marginally interesting situations , beautifully filmed , hypnotically seductive , and cloaked in a plodding and laconically self-assured pretense . Those looking for a solid story or serious drama will be disappointed . Others may content themselves with the visual feast in spite of the absence of substance and a two hour run time .
Leary & Hurley better than before .	Leary and Hurley hook up again for this fun little romcom romp which aired on cable under the title " Dawg " . IMHO better than their previous collaboration " Double Whammy " , this flick tells of a womanizer who will inherit a fortune if he can be forgiven his sexual trespasses by a dozen of his womanized victims . Hurley , attorney for the estate , tags along to bear witness leading to much fun , silly moments , a whiff of romance , a sentimental thread , and a kicker at the end . " Dawg " may not be Oscar material but it is quirky , unpredictable , and carries a message and a moral . Worth a look especially by romantic comedy suckers like moi . (
Much ado about something	In " Possession " , a rough-hewn American poetry researcher in England ( Eckhart ) meets a lithe and icy Brit ( Paltrow ) and together they retrace the footsteps and thoughts of a renown English poet laureate of the mid-1850s , methodically piecing together unknown portions of his life involving romance , love , infidelity , and more , all the while falling in like with each other while trying to outwit their competition . Beautifully done though much too pat , this meandering odyssey of discovery is a kind of elegant dog in a Hollywood wrapper with a UK shoot . The film deserves much credit for structure , composition , execution , score , etc . However , most will find it just too much ado about too little . A film which is not likely to make you weep , laugh , or swoon but very well make evoke a yawn or two . ( B )
A nice Nolte nicks with Nutsa near Nice	" A Good Thief " is a smart heist flick with Nolte at the center as a rogue with a heart and a habit who is as at home at a casino baccarat table as he is in the streets of Nice . This film is all about Nolte , a babe , and his gang of expert thief assistants who assemble to rip off a Monte Carlo casino under the watchful eye of the cops . This well crafted flick features a cosmopolitan cast , a crisp location shoot on the Riviera , a cleverly convoluted story which gets busy and stays busy , attention to detail seldom seen in movies , and a good musical score . Recommended for anyone into heist flicks but don't expect much else . This tight little drama is all about the heist . ( B )
The absence of love	" Intimacy " tells of a divorced man and a married woman who have weekly loveless sex while each knows little of the other . The film explores the " why " of their peculiar relationship and follows the pair of protags to their inevitable conclusion . Whatever you know , think , or read about this film , it does break new ground as it pushes legitimate cinema one small measure toward its destiny by illuminating that dark corner of human behavior currently occupied only by pornography . Be prepared for graphic sex / nudity and some intensely personal scenes in a stark , austere , somewhat depressing but very courageous drama . Not for prudes , " Intimacy " will be most enjoyed by mature drama enthusiasts . ( B )
Chick flick for midlife	" The Flower of My Secret " follows a middle-aged married woman and somewhat neurotic novelist , Leo ( Paredes ) , on the verge of divorce from the handwriting on the wall to the separation to the final realization and adjustments required to get her life back on track . There's little plot to be found in this linear dramady which sees Leo bumping into the people in her life for brief tete-a-tetes and bouncing off her emotional walls as she tries to cope with the inevitable . Not Almodovar's best work , this busy , mildly humorous , dialogue-intensive contempo Spanish flick received mild approval from critical corners and the public alike . Short on story but very well composed , " The Flower of My Secret " will play best with women , especially Spanish speakers or foreign film buffs . ( B )
70 % Keitel , 25 % Skarsgård , and 100 % drama	In " Taking Sides " , Keitel is a U . S . Army Major in Berlin after WWII . His task as a denazification inquisitor is to separate the populous into black hats , white hats , and gray hats : In particular , one gray hat symphony orchestra conductor , Skarsgård . The film , which bears the ear marks of it's theatrical pedigree , focuses entirely on Keitel's investigation and interrogation of the conductor as it creates some serious dramatic moments which the principals dispatch in fine style . However , because of the esoteric nature of its content and the issues it examines ( eg : separation of art and politics , etc . ) " Taking Sides " will not likely have broad appeal and should be most appreciated by those into serious theatrical ensemble drama . It's worth noting that some potent parallels exist between " Taking Sides " and current events in Iraq which may make the film seem more poignant and contemporaneous . ( B )
Entertainment over history	" Henry VIII " ( 2003 ) tells the story of England's King Henry VIII ( 1491-1547 ) . Ray Winstone is the centerpiece of the film as Henry , a robust and brutal but secretly sensitive King obsessed with siring a male heir to throne . The TV miniseries spends its 4 hour run focused on Henry's involvements with his six wives while dabbling in other benchmarks of his reign and taking liberties where possible for dramatic purposes . Not the best possible historical accounting of the period , this colorful and energetic film does offers some very solid performances and good production value . " Henry VIII " is an enjoyable primer for the not too critical viewer who seeks entertainment value over historical accuracy . ( B )
Brave	" The Woodsman " takes the audience into the life of a working class pedophile following his release from prison . The film centers on Bacon as a man tormented by his perverse desires while struggling to carve out a life for himself in an unforgiving society . A brave film which received good marks from critics and public , " The Woodsman " takes no position , has no agenda , and answers none of the many questions it asks . It simply provides a sense of what life as a pedophile might be like and that's saying a lot . Those who expect a typical story arc may be disappointed by the morose moodiness of this open-ended downer flick while those who don't mind lingering in a world of aberrant psychology may find it an interesting experience . ( B )
Seldom is so much accomplished with so little	" Solas " spends its 100 minute run digging deep into the character of Maria ( Fernández ) , an attractive 35 year old brittle pessimist who bears the scars of childhood abuse at the hands of her father , drinks too much , and works as a janitor . A somber , plodding , plaintive character study , " Solas " fleshes out its small ensemble of characters well , illuminating the dark corners of Maria's hopelessness with an unlikely combination of her visiting mother's quiet courage and the friendship of an old man in a neighboring apartment . An award winning film hailed by the critics and an exemplar for American Indie makers , " Solas " will appeal most to more mature audiences into Europix . Those who enjoy this film may want to check out " El Abuelo " ( 1998 ) . ( B )
Good show , Showtime !	The charm of " Bobbie's Girl " isn't so much in the story as in the telling . A sweetly sentimental slice-of-life feel good flick from Showtime , the film tells of a middle-aged lesbian couple operating a tavern on the coast of Ireland who unexpectedly find themselves with the yin-yang of a wee lad and the " Big C " in their midst . The film offers fine performances from a core cast of four who fully flesh-out their characters making for an easy emotional buy-in . Those who have become used to the usual exaggerated dramatic film fare may enjoy the soft-peddled delivery of this lilting , life-affirming drama while others may regard it as uneventful fluff . Note - Those who might be turned-off by the same-sex relationship at the center of this film should know that the lesbianism is very understated and tastefully presented .
Cute little diversion for oldsters and Allen fans	" The curse of the jade scorpion " refers to the post hypnotic suggestion given by a night club hypnotist to an insurance investigator ( Allen ) and his efficiency expert inter-office rival ( Hunt ) . Both become embroiled in a jewel theft caper and spend most of their time at each others throats in this circa 1940 noir romantic / comedy ( emphasis on the comedy ) played out to saxy jazz strains and the usual fast talking gag-a-minute Allen repartee loaded with 30's vernacular . Those old enough to be familiar with " shamus " or " Sophisticated Lady " will likely get the most enjoyment from this easy going but busy little comedic venture in which Allen's signature hi-brow Freudian New York state-of-mind gives way to a lower brow , softer , and slightly more romantic attitude . Fun stuff with a great ending for Allen fans . ( B )
Think " Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon "	" Hero " is by all accounts a very big if not huge movie with plaudits aplenty from critics and public . The film tells a sort of epic adventure fairy tale about an assassin ( Jet Li ) and a handful of cohorts who conspire to kill a king which is high melodrama Chinese style and not likely to have a great appeal to westerners . What sets " Hero " apart from most other martial art films is the spectacular locations , sets , costumes , music , CGI , and state-of-the-art production value . Lyric , beautiful , and very Asian , " Hero " will play best with fans of " Crouching Tiger . . . " who don't mind watching people flying around like Peter Pan while flailing away with their swords . (
A picture postcard perfect little tale	" A Month by the Lake " has strong parallels with " Up at the Villa " as both films are about the idle rich who spend time at a villa in the North of Italy in the days prior to WWII . " A Month . . . " is a sublime story about a very starched Brit ( Fox ) and a somewhat capricious lady ( Redgrave ) . Both mature , in late middle age , the principals stumble along on a collision course with love in this sweet , airy , picture postcard perfect little tale . An enjoyable watch for more mature audiences . A must see for Redgrave fans .
A very British dramedy	" A Very British Coup " is a very British 3x50 minute TV dramady laced with typically British wry wit which tells of the election to Prime Minister of a Labor Party candidate who is determined to turn the conservative iron fisted grip on the UK into government by the people . As the new PM , Harry Perkins ( McAnally ) , sets about to rid the country of nukes and American military bases his own government's secret snoops conspire to ensure his failure and resist his liberal attempts to change the status quo . The result is a clever and very well stitched together tale of one-upmanship at the top of the Brit government . Should be an enjoyable and entertaining DVD watch for anyone interested in British government and a sort of British version of " An American President " . ( B )
Curl up with this like you would with a Christie or Sayers novel	" Painted Lady " is a 3 . 5 hour , two part miniseries made for Masterpiece Theater and featuring Helen Mirren as Maggie , a down and out and aging ex-druggie / blues singer who inhabits a cottage on the Ireland estate of a well-to-do friend . When her friend is murdered , Maggie makes an unlikely transformation as she turns herself into a countess , enters the world of classical painting treasures , and sets about to bring the killer to justice . A cozy mystery with a whiff of sex and drugs but nary a harsh word spoken , this typical Masterpiece Theater TV fare is a mildly entertaining watch which keeps moving as it becomes increasingly convoluted . On the downside , Mirren is much too sagacious and elegant for a down and out blues singer and the warm and fuzzy milieu fits the intended audience better than the story . On the upside , this Mirren tour de force and tale of intrigues in the world of art is captivating , engrossing , and sufficiently substantiative to keep the viewer involved for the long haul . Recommended for more mature viewers and those who enjoy the very civilized Masterpiece Theater fare . ( B )
A slowly endearing , plaintive , quirky slice-of-life tale .	" Margaret's Museum " tells of a young Nova Scotia woman who's bound by her family ties to a coal mining town where frequent accidents in the " pit " take their toll on the mine workers and their families . Not just another coal mining flick , " MM " focuses with musings , humor , and poignant moments on Margaret , who's nose is always running , and her assorted quirky family and friends . An engrossing , somewhat compelling , and almost charming little film , " MM " should appeal to those with a taste for slice-of-life flicks involving eccentric folk .
A good but pointless misanthropic dark satire .	Perhaps the real value to " American Psycho " is the fodder it will provide for film critics and pedantic cinematic devotees . It is a slick job of manufacturing on Harron's part with a superb performance by Bale . However , the general film-going public will likely find it ambiguous , pointless , grotesque , and lacking the entertainment value of the real American " Psycho " by Hitchcock .
Take a bite out of crime	" Red Dragon " , a prequel sequel ( or something like that ) to " Silence of the Lambs " , keeps Hannibal ( Hopkins ) in his cell while it pushes an FBI Agent ( Norton ) and a new whacko cannibalistic nemesis D . aka " The Tooth Fairy " ( Finnes ) into the spotlight . The film is seems somewhat more contrived than it's trio of siblings and may be somewhat the lesser member of the family . Nonetheless , it features lots of star power , solid stylistics , a hook at the end , and dovetails neatly with " Silence . . . " . Recommended for Hannibal fans , cannibals , and those into flicks about psychos killers . ( B )
A film with a heart and some good jazz	" The Tic Code " tells of a boy ( Marquette ) with Tourette's syndrome who plays jazz piano and makes friends with a professional sax player ( Hines ) who also has the affliction . A well crafted , earnest , and honest effort , the film would appear to be a labor of love as , according to IMDB . com info , Draper , who wrote the screenplay and played the boy's mother , is married to a jazz musician with Tourette's ( who has a bit part in the movie ) . The film features solid performances by all with an exceptional job by Marquette , some good jazz music , and insights into the tic fraught life . Unfortunately , The Tic Code is not likely to be as commercially successful as it should because Tourette's pales in comparison with terminal cancer , for example , and will likely seem little more than a mildly troublesome disorder to a jaded public . Kudos to all who supported this worthy project .
Southern discomfort	In " The Ladykillers " , an erudite and refined Southern Gentleman ( Hanks ) takes a room with an elderly but sagacious black women in MIssissippi for the purpose of using her basement to tunnel to a vault full of gambling money with assistance from a group of four men , all stereotypical caricatures , who pretend to be an ensemble of musicians . This wacky comedy , imbued with the Coen's subtly sardonic humor , reverberates with prayer meeting gospel music and blatant unabashed silliness as the quintet of thieves set about to do their dirty deed . A not-for-everyone comedy which is long on style and short on story , " The Ladykillers " is more likely to elicit the occasional cluck of the tongue than boisterous guffaws . Entertaining though not memorable and worth a look by anyone into the Coen brothers off kilter sense of humor . ( B )
A funny and slightly sentimental flick for boomers .	Although a sort of comedy / drama-lite , " Still Crazy " does something which most of the recent raft of formula romantic comedies fail to do . Specifically , the film manages character development so well that their absurd nature , necessary to be funny , does not interfere with the emotional " buy in " making it possible for the audience to empathize with the characters while enjoying their humorous antics . " SC " tells of a motley bunch of aging ex-rock stars who , after 20 years apart , reconstitute the band to have a go at touring again . The film uses the Rea and Aubrey characters as the center of gravity ( straight wo / man ) around which the rest of the band can create off-the-wall humor , some decent music , and some poignant moments . The result is a very good journeyman effort which will likely be enjoyed most by " baby boomers " . . . even those who may have outgrown rock music .
See Travolta smirk . See Berry's boobs . See Jackman type . See . . .	" Swordfish " is a rock'em , sock'em action no-brainer with Travolta as a deliciously likeable villain , Berry as a deliciously topless DEA agent , Jackman as a the world's faster typist , and Cheadle as an FBI agent . Not to be taken seriously , this flick rocks with all the stuff we've come to expect from Hollyweird . . . star power , stunts , pyro , visual effects , busses flying , bullets whizzing , cars crashing , yadayadayada . A must see for action junkies and enjoyable mindless escapism for others . Note - the plot , feeble as it may be , is eerily more poignant since 9-11 .
What - is - after all the pomp and circumstance ?	That ponderous question is on the minds of the graduating students of a fictitious college and it shows in the apprehension on the fresh faces which are the focus of " Graduation Week " . Among the characters of this even tempered B-flick are a diehard feminist , a sexually conflicted model female student , a black man on the fast track to success , etc . The film straddles the comedy and drama genres gracefully as it follows its characters through poignant realizations of what's important in life while the world awaits their contributions to humanity . Sensitive and full of heart , this big little flick will make for an entertaining watch for females and more mature males ; especially those with nostalgic remembrances of their graduation week . ( B )
Sentimental old guy ensemble flick	Jack's ( Caine ) ashes are in the urn and the company of his old friends and pub mates as " Last Orders " recounts Jack's life via reminiscing and flashbacks . Jack's life was not sufficiently interesting to make this film worthy . Rather , the sweetness and beauty of " Last Orders " comes from the nostalgia , remembrances , and sentimental reflection of the players , the old duffers , as they haul Jack to his final destination . An excellent ensemble film which will most likely appeal to more mature males . ( B ) Note - Be prepared for thick British accents and lots of jargon with which you may not be familiar . I viewed this flick with subtitles for language support .
Worthy but not for general consumption .	" Camille Claudel " is an earnest biopic which tells of her rise to prominence in Paris as a student ( and mistress ) of renown sculptor Auguste Rodin , their love / hate relationship , her struggle for independent recognition as an artist , and her eventual descent into madness . A subtitled French film , " Camille Claudel " deserves high marks on all counts with sterling performances by all and all the trappings of late 19th century life in Paris . If the film has a flaw , it is the almost 2 . 5 hours is spends on the historically obscure , esoteric , and decidedly unpleasant subject which is likely to wear on , if not wear out , the casual filmgoer interested in entertainment . Not for the many , " Camille Claudel " will play best for patrons or students of French art , art history , sculpting , etc . ; for those with an interest in Rodin and / or Claudel ; and , of course , fans of the principals . ( B )
Bored the dickens out of me	" Nicholas Nickleby " , a par retelling of the lengthy Dickens novel on the silver screen , has little to praise and little to fault as it presents it's digest in a squeaky clean format with a very robust young man who never coughs playing a cripple with consumption and Nicholas himself with nary a single strand of hair out of place as he suffers gross misfortunes . The good are oh so good and the bad are , well , kind of bad though no one ever kicks a puppy . Good stuff for sentimentalists , romantics , and others who prefer their classic idealized , sanitized , and Disneyesque . ( B )
The British " Ghost " ?	Juliet Stevenson proves her mettle in " Truly , Madly , Deeply " with a superb performance as a woman struck with grief who overcomes same in spite of her friends and with a little help from " the other side " . A definite chick flick according to the IMDB . com stats , this plaintive but hopeful drama with a dash of comedy about personal reconciliation is a worthy effort for those who can get their head around the whole " ghost " thing . For more mature audiences and , of course , chicks . ( NOTE : Write / director Anthony Minghella introduces himself and his film at the beginning of the DVD which I viewed ; a smart move and a nice touch which will engender good will much more than huge imposing in-your-face letters like " DIRECTED BY STEVEN SPIELBERG " .
Cute , cute stuff .	" Miss Congeniality " is a fun little comedy with Bullock at the center playing an FBI agent who has to go undercover as a beauty pageant contestant . Bullock is finally in her element in this flick which sports a lively screeplay , a clever script with lots of " call backs " , and a good supporting cast . A must see for Bullock fans and a fun watch for most others .
An E . Q . test for guys	" Home Room " spends most of its time fleshing out two teen female characters from opposite ends of the campus peer group spectrum who both survive a high school home room shooting spree . One is a goth chick with a bad attitude and the other a prissy sosh from the upper class . In addition to the obvious school shooting topic , this exceptional one man band indie drives home some important points about death , appearance-based judgments , etc . However , the real meat on the bones of this film is the evolution of friendship between the two protags ; something which drives home the oft missed point that we all have more in common than not and a little empathy can serve us well . " Home Room " manages solid performances , style , enough depth to make the plot holes easily overlooked , and more bang for the buck than most one man indies . Most likely to be appreciate by females not because it's a chick flick but because most guys just won't get it . (
The best lesbian love story I've seen	" Aimee and Jaguar " tells of the love which blossoms between two women , one married with four children and one a Jewess , in Berlin . Beautifully filmed and character-driven with splendid directing and superb performances , there's little to fault in this film as two women cleave to one another under the pall of war , the terror of bombing , and the absence of men . The only liability " A & J " has is the subject may not whet the interest of many .
A wonderfully satirical comedy .	" Waiting for Guffman " is a clever satirical comedy about a handful of citizen's in Blaine , Missouri , a fictitious town celebrating its sesquicentennial . The film uses the mockumentary approach to show a motley bunch of wannabee performers as they create a musical stage play depicting the town's history . Actor / Writer / Director Christopher Guest is the centerpiece of the film playing a gay performer with some real off-off-off-off-Broadway experience who produces the town's musical . A great watch for anyone who loves satire or that off-the-wall , tongue-in-cheek Second City brand of humor .
When is a girl a woman ?	When a woman is killed in a car wreck , she leaves behind a husband and a daughter by an exhusband who become the center of gravity of the film . As the step father and beautiful 14 year old nymphet share their grief under the same roof , the girl reveals an uncommon maturity as she insinuates herself into the step father's life by taking on her mother's responsibilities and demanding her place in his bed . What follows is an unemotional , matter of fact , tastefully presented tale of two people whose familial love morphs into something more as they grapple with all the issues which come with their extraordinary and taboo relationship . " Beau Pere " aims for the head and ricochets off the heat but leaves the crotch alone . Not " Lolita " and not a film about pedophilia or seduction , this flick should be an interesting watch for anyone into films about atypical romantic relationships . (
A very worthy film out of Russia .	" The Thief " is a Russian slice-of-miserable-life film about a Soviet boy and his young widowed mother who fall in with a charismatic soldier of low character . Other than a beautfully filmed look at the Russian landscape and culture , rarely seen in the West , this austere but well crafted Hollywood antagonist offers the viewer little more than the three characters and their story . The interest in the film is realized through empathy for the characters ; something made easy by excellent performances , direction , screenplay , etc . An excellent , plaintive film about life under difficult circumstances and one boy's coming of age .
Good advice ? Watch it .	" Good Advice " tells of a down and out ex-stock broker ( Sheen ) who takes over his girl friend's advice column leading to love , success , and much fun . With a zinger every few seconds , funny characters and situations , a clever story with a feel good conclusion , " Good Advice " makes for a fresh and fun watch . In the absence of hype and considering the talent behind the film , " GA " qualifies as a " sleeper " and should be a pleasant surprise for most who manage to snag it on cable .
