The Cuckoo Schmaltz	This Granada sitcom gave Lewis Collins his first taste of television stardom . He played wealthy ' Gavin Rumsey ' , on the rebound from a failed marriage , who moves in with the poor but happy Chris and Fliss ( yuck ! ) Hawthorne . Er , why ? With his money , why doesn't he get a place of his own ? His presence disrupts the smooth day-to-day running of the house , ' dolly birds ' are soon flitting about , and expensive gadgetry is installed . David Roper ' Chris was so irritating one wondered why Fliss didn't ditch him and run off with the better-looking Gavin . Beautiful Diane Keen did her best with a role which gave her nothing to do other than push a pram and look bewildered . Collins ' Gavin seemed a try-out for his later role as hard-man ' Bodie ' in ' The Professionals ' . The late Geoffrey Lancashire wrote the less-than hilarious scripts ( he also worked on ' The Lovers ' ) . In 1980 , the show was briefly revived , with Ian Saynor replacing Collins , but it was just as limp as before .
Defective Commentaries	In theory , ' Director's Commentary ' should have worked . The talented Rob Bryden plays Peter DeLane , a former television director recounting his experiences behind the camera . Amongst the programmes he is alleged to have worked on are ' Bonanza ' , ' Flambards ' , ' The Duchess Of Duke Street ' , and ' The Bounder ' . His commentaries are not the least bit informative , due to his habit of wandering off the point . But in practice , it failed dismally . It is a one-joke show , and the joke is not particularly funny . The scripts are completely lacking in wit , and Bryden fails to convince as an old man . Whenever stuck for anything amusing to say , which is like every five seconds , he issues a hissing laugh . Rather than being amused by DeLane , you want to shoot him . If senile old men strike you as hilarious , then this is for you . It didn't help that the shows mocked were , with the exceptions of ' Mr & Mrs ' and ' Crossroads ' , rather good . For the joke to work , they needed to be really dreadful such as ' Charlie's Angels ' , ' O . T . T . ' , ' Telly Addicts ' , ' Neighbours ' , and ' New Faces ' . The show tanked big time , so thankfully we are spared the horror of future editions . Wouldn't it be deliciously ironic if ' Director's Commentary ' were someday itself the subject of a spoof ?
Night Of A Thousand Knives More Like !	As the twenty-first century dawned , the B . B . C . decided to put out a special programme commemorating its finest achievements . Michael Parkinson hosted , and the studio was packed with celebrities . I tuned in hoping to see clips of long forgotten shows , maybe learn something of how they came to be made . What we got instead though was less of a celebration , more of a cremation . The rot started with an odd black and white clip of a man dancing energetically outside the B . B . C . T . V . Centre . Parky failed to tell us what show it came from . It looked like Michael Bentine's ' Its A Square World ' to me ( the ex-Goon was forever using the Centre as a venue for elaborate gags ) . Parky's only comment was " the next time anyone mentions the golden age of television , remind them of that ! " . Hang on mate . You should have done your homework . That clip might have been intentionally funny . Not that the audience gave a monkey's . The director then treated us to a close up of some chinless wonder in a tuxedo braying like a donkey . Either he had imbibed too much brandy or his sense of humour was seriously underdeveloped . I presumed he must be the Commissioning Editor of B . B . C . - 3's Comedy Department . Next up was Jeremy Irons , chatting about his time as a presenter on the children's show ' Play Away ! ' . He was clearly embarrassed . Why , I wondered , was it here at all . ' Play Away ! ' was a charming show ( Tony Robinson also featured on it ) in its day , but hardly one of Auntie's masterpieces . Ernest Maxin , ex-producer of ' The Morecambe & Wise Show ' , was mocked for referring to his stars ' faces as ' gorgeous ' . I think he meant it in the sense that they were funny , rather than ' sexy ' , but the audience seemed not to grasp this . Among the classic drama series featured was ' Dr . Who ' . Now I like the show , but do not think it should be compared with ' I Claudius ' , ' The Forsyte Saga ' and ' Edge Of Darkness ' . The audience laughed maniacally as the Cyber-Leader menaced a curly-headed Tom Baker . It hailed from a 1975 adventure entitled ' Revenge Of The Cybermen ' , not generally held in high esteem by Whovians . It dawned on me . This was the latest in a long line of shows designed to rebuff criticism of present day B . B . C . programmes by subjecting its past output to public ridicule . Other examples of the genre include ' I Can't Believe I Watched that ! ' and ' I Love The ' 70's / ' 80's / ' 90's ' . An out-of-context clip will be shown , followed by some would-be comedian making a smart aleck remark . A few of the items were generally amusing , such as Parky reading aloud an internal B . B . C . memo predicting that ' Fawlty Towers ' would flop . How wrong can you be ? The exploding B . B . C . T . V . Centre from the ' Goodies ' episode ' Sex And Violence ' was aired , much to Bill Oddie's obvious delight . But the nadir of the whole evening came when Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer attempted to recreate a classic Morecambe and Wise sketch . Alongside Tom Jones , they mimed ( ' yeh ! yeh ! yeh ! ' ) to ' Exactly Like You ' . Now I know that Reeves and Mortimer have often been likened to Eric and Ernie ( put Vic in glasses and a hat and the resemblance to the former is uncanny ) , but you would think they would have the good sense not to copy one of their most famous musical numbers . It would be as sacrilegious as them putting on bowlers and trying to be Laurel and Hardy . One person in the audience unamused by the routine was Ronnie Barker . He asked the B . B . C . to edit it out of the broadcast . They refused . Well intentioned it may have been , but as the original sketch still exists it was hard to see why they bothered . Parky wrapped things up by stating that the B . B . C . had ' made the popular good , and the good popular ' . I agree , but why devote seventy minutes on a Saturday night to making the good look ludicrous ? As an archive T . V . enthusiast , shindigs like this make me despair . Its like going into a public library and tearing up old books simply because they were produced differently to modern day editions . Why not just show the programmes and allow us to make up our own minds as to whether they were bad or not ? Or is that too much to ask ?
Easily The Worst And Most Unnecessary Remake Ever !	Its disturbing to note the number of classic ' 70's films that have had their reputations trashed by ' remakes ' - ' The Wicker Man ' , ' The Texas Chainsaw Massacre ' , ' The Omen ' , ' Assault On Precinct 13 ' and now this . Ira Levin's novel was not a laugh-out-loud comedy , and neither was Bryan Forbes ' 1975 movie , but this Frank Oz-directed film tries to be - and fails dismally . The screenplay adheres closely to the original story , but over-eggs the pudding with ' funny ' one-liners , and a ludicrous ' happy ' ending which makes the finale of the 1980 ' Revenge Of The Stepford Wives ' T . V . movie seem believable by comparison . The story was intended as a darkly humorous comment on the women's lib movement , as the male population of a small American town tries to reverse the tide of feminism by murdering their wives and replacing them with robot doubles , replicas both obedient and beautiful . But the tone of the original has been allowed to leak away ; this lumbering travesty has the look and feel of a 1960's sitcom . About the only thing missing is a laugh track . As for the performances , Nicole Kidman is so wooden that when she first appeared I thought she had already been ' replaced ' . Bette Midler , is as always , terrible . Glenn Close , Christopher Walken and Matthew Broderick could have phoned in their performances . The exact nature of the duplications is confused - are the women being replaced by robots , or simply brainwashed ? For most of the picture , it appears to be the former , but when Broderick shuts down the control centre at the climax , the wives regain their personalities , suggesting the latter . What a cop-out . I have heard complaints that the 1975 movie was ' cheesy ' . Well , let me put the record straight . Fashions , hairstyles , technology etc . may have changed dramatically since the 70's , but the fact remains that Bryan Forbes ' movie is a far better picture than this one . William Goldman's script did not insult the intelligence of the audience , and Katherine Ross and Paula Prentiss outclass Kidman and Midler . On the cheeseometer , the remake registers as pure Stilton . I wonder which sci-fi classic will be next in line for the same treatment . John Frankenheimer's ' Seconds ' ? Will the remake end with ' Tony Wilson ' ( the Rock Hudson character in the original ) cracking lame gags as a Company doctor drills his skull ?
Loose Teeth !	I have a theory as to why ' Loose Women ' exists . The Government have been making a lot of noise recently about how disabled people should be made to look for work . ' Loose ' is obviously intended to get the ' slackers ' out of their wheelchairs and into the Job Centres . It is so stupid and mind-numbingly boring as to defy description . Its a simple recipe : take four middle-aged has-beens ( one a failed soap actress , one an over-the-hill pop singer , one whose only claim to fame is that her husband ditched her as soon as he got famous , and one of whom I've never heard ) , give them a glass of gin each , and put them on air . As one would expect , the main topic of conversation is sex . If none of these women were famous , odds are they'd be hard pressed to get any . Every time the word ' sex ' is mentioned , the studio audience - mostly made up of hysterical grandmothers - goes into hyper drive . The guests consist mainly of thespians plugging their latest film / play / T . V . show . But the highlight of each show is a phone-in quiz which taxes the viewer's intellect with such difficult questions as ' In which street is ' Coronation Street ' set ? ' . Kaye is bossy , Colleen bland , Sherrie ( when she's there ) is loud , as is Denise , and Carol can't utter a sentence without blaming The Government for something or other . They tried Lesley Garrett on the show , without much success . She was too much of a lady to fit in with this dreary bunch . One final thought : we live in an age of so-called ' sexual equality ' , so why isn't there a show called ' Loose Men ' ?
God help us . . .	In the early 1990's , I . T . V . abolished the ' God slot ' , meaning that religious programmes could no longer be broadcast in the early part of Sunday evening , instead viewers would have to make do with family movies and game shows of the ' Family Fortunes ' variety . It was quite a jump from Sir Cliff Richard singing ' Abide With Me ' to ' Honey I Shrunk The Kids ' . ' Stars On Sunday ' , made by Yorkshire Television , was a religiously themed variety show , a sort of ' Sunday Night At The London Palladium ' with hymn books . Internationally famous stars of the calibre of Kenneth McKellar , Moira Anderson , Eartha Kitt , James Mason , Harry Secombe and Christopher Lee ( yes , you read that correctly ! Old Count Dracula himself used to read extracts from The Bible on this show ) appeared . Normally such talent did not come cheap , but producer and presenter Jess Yates had a knack for persuading stars to work for next to nothing . Perhaps they thought it a worthy cause , like the bands who went on Live Aid in 1985 . Perhaps they thought that by going on the show it would greatly increase their chances of reaching Heaven . We shall never know . Millions tuned in each week to see Sir Harry and co . performing spiritually uplifting songs against a background of cardboard cut-out sheep and tinsel . It was the complete opposite of his later show ' Highway ' ( how I miss that ! ) which took him around the country . Not all the ' turns ' were stars . There was The Poole Family , Britain's answer to The Osmonds , who grinned their way through the hymn back catalogue . I forget how many there were ( it seemed like a new member joined each week ) . The youngest member was chirpy Glyn , whom a T . V . Times reader likened to actor Kenneth Haigh , star of I . T . V . ' s sleazy drama ' Man At The Top ' . I never found out whether that was intended as a complement or not . Linking the acts was , of course , Jess Yates , seated before an organ ( a musical one , so don't worry ) which he would then play a la Terry Jones in ' Monty Python's Flying Circus ' ( only fully clothed ) . Yates was known as ' The Bishop ' on account of his oh-so solemn delivery . Watching him you would think you had tuned into a funeral service by mistake . Viewers used to send in requests for hymns . One night , he introduced ' When The Saints Go Marching In ' and made it sound as though Judgement Day had arrived . Stanley Baxter did a splendid spoof on his ' Picture Show ' called ' Scars On Sunday ' in which he caught to a tee Yates ' sepulchral manner . ' Stars On Sunday ' used to go out ahead of sitcoms such as ' On The Buses ' and ' Doctor In Charge ' which meant that one minute you were watching David Frost reciting the parable of The Good Samaritan , the next Reg Varney and Bob Grant were insulting Stephen Lewis . Alas , it came to pass that Yates had been having it off with a woman half his age , and Yorkshire T . V . did thus cast him out into the wilderness forevermore , much to the amusement no doubt of his long-term rival Hughie Green . The show carried on without The Bishop for a good few years , finally ending in 1979 . Other shows moved into the ' God slot ' , thankfully none quite as stuffy or pretentious . This show did more to promote atheism in Britain than any other , before or since .
The Nesbitts Came & Went !	Firstly , let me state for the record that ' The Nesbitts Are Coming ' has no connection whatever with ' Rab C . Nesbitt ' ( wasn't the 2008 Christmas Special hilarious , by the way ? ) . Rab made his debut on BBC-2's ' Naked Video ' a good six years after this Yorkshire T . V . series ended . It was written by Dick Sharples , responsible for the charming undertaker sitcom ' In Loving Memory ' with Thora Hird and Christopher Beeny . It had a good cast including Clive Swift ( ' Richard ' of ' Keeping Up Appearances ' ) , Maggie Jones ( ' Blanche ' from ' Coronation Street ' ) , Deirdre Costello ( ' Linda Preston ' from ' I Didn't Know You Cared ' ) , Ken Jones ( ' Ives ' from ' Porridge ' ) , and the always reliable Tony Melody and Patsy Rowlands . The Nesbitts were what might today be termed a problem family ; they roamed the North-East in an open-topped van , terrorising communities either by conning or stealing from them . Had Asbos existed then , they would have been a dead cert to get them . Swift was ' Ernie ' , the perpetually coughing father who rarely spoke except make requests to be taken to the loo . Jones was his loud wife , about whom a policeman once remarked : " if she wasn't Northern , I'd swear she was Sicillian ' . John Price's ' Len ' was like ' Tucker ' from ' Citizen Smith ' in that he dressed at all times like a cowboy . Costello's ' Marlene ' threw herself at anything in trousers , while ' Tom ' ( Christian Rodska ) was a dead ringer for ' Vyvian ' from ' The Young Ones ' . Their arch-nemesis was the incompetent ' Det . Sgt . Arnold Nixon ' ( Ken Jones ) who wanted nothing more than to see this scurrilous gang put behind bars for good . To this end , he assigned W . P . C . Kitty Naylor ( Patsy Rowlands ) to go undercover , and pretend to fall in love with Len to find out what the family were up to . The problem was that she really had fallen in love , and was torn between her personal feelings and duties as a policewoman . . . ' The Nesbitts ' had originally appeared in a May 1967 episode of the B . B . C . ' s crime drama ' Z-Cars ' , entitled ' ' The Nesbitts Are Back ' . Hylda Baker played ' Mrs . Nesbitt ' , with a young Lynda La Plante as ' Marlene ' ! But the family's move into comedy was ill-advised - they proved about as funny as typhoid . For reasons best known to himself , Sharples had the characters burst into song every now and then , causing the comedy to grind to a halt . Songs such as the slushy ' I'm Not Getting My Share Of Life ' , sung by Patsy Rowlands . Its chorus went as follows : " I'm not getting my share / of living , loving , its not fair / I'm not getting my share of life . " . It was like watching a third-rate West End musical . The show was not getting its share of viewers either . Most were put-off by the intrusive music . As far as I know , only ' The Mighty Boosh ' has done anything similar recently , and that should give you some idea how truly bad it was .
A ' Big Train ' For The Older Generation ?	One can only wonder how this show came about . Was the B . B . C . ' s Head Of Comedy so stung by complaints of the ' today's comedies are not as funny as the old ones ' type that he commissioned a show intended to prove the opposite ? ' Revolver ' had a great cast , but alas didn't provide them with decent material . Many of the sketches look like offcuts from ' Big Train ' . To give an example : Roy Barraclough looks out of a window and sees a nude man bouncing on a trampoline in his garden . Enraged , he tells his wife to phone the police while he goes out to have a word with the man . No sooner has his wife got through to the police than she hears giggling . Looking out of the window , she sees her husband - also naked - is with the man on the trampoline . Now this would have worked for Mark Heap , but not Roy Barraclough . The final result was a strange combination of the best of yesterday's comedy combined with the worst of today's . Don't blame the cast - the scriptwriters should have been shot with a revolver !
More Plain Than Pearl	Reg and Old Wol are stuffing themselves with oysters when the former finds a pearl in his . Convinced it might be valuable , he hides it from his workmates ' beady eyes , before taking it to a jewellers ' . That night , he offers it as a gift to Irene , who accepts . But when the jeweller phones to tell them it is worth £1000 she becomes worried , fearing ( somewhat unbelievably ) that it is technically stolen property . Reg says it is a perk of the job . To placate her fears , Reg nervously approaches Mr . Preston and attempts to purchase oysters , so he can pretend he found the pearl in one . Preston tells him the oyster batch was a one-off , and that no more will be coming into the market . So what must he do ? The final ' Down The ' Gate ' bears more than a passing resemblance to the ' On The Buses ' episode ' Lost Property ' . It may seem strange to say this but watching these episodes made me realise just how important to the success of ' Buses ' Bob Grant was . Here Varney has no-one to bounce his humour off . ' Reg Furnell ' seems to enjoy a higher standard of living than ' Stan Butler ' - nice home , nice wife , and nice suits . Not bad for a Billingsgate fish porter . One of the programme's few good points is Dilys Laye ( who sadly passed on in February of this year ) as Reg's wife Irene . The domestic scenes are funnier than those set in the market itself . Funniest moment - in the canteen , Reg lets Old Wol handle the pearl . Seeing someone coming , the latter quickly drops it in a bottle of brown sauce . Reg's horrified expression says it all . I used to watch each week not because I thought it was good , but because it was the nearest thing to ' On The Buses ' on the box at that time . I was acutely aware it was not as funny . Fortunately , we now have the entire run of ' Buses ' on D . V . D . to enjoy whenever we want , hence there is no real need for this show to be seen by anyone ever again .
Simon In The ' 80's	A decade after the Ian Ogilvy version , ' The Saint ' was back on our screens , this time played by Simon Dutton . We were promised a tougher , grittier take on the character , but the series failed to deliver . Dutton was handsome but lacked the charm required for the role . Once again , there was expensive location filming , but with no noticeable benefit . The old Moore episodes were more entertaining even though they rarely strayed beyond Elstree . This ' Saint ' resembled those cheap Continental Bond knock-offs of the ' 60's . The decision to upgrade the show from one hour to two hour episodes proved disastrous . ' The Saint ' isn't ' Inspector Morse ' . It also suffered from the absence of writer John Kruse . ' The Software Murders ' was the best episode by far , one wonders why it wasn't used to open the series . After the second episode - the atrocious ' Blue Dulac ' - went out , L . W . T . yanked ' The Saint ' from its prime-time Saturday evening slot , and the rest went out the following summer to nobody's great pleasure .
Not Very Hot	Cleaning Mr . Cromwell's office , Potter sucks the headmaster's pet mouse up his vacuum cleaner . It is not the only disaster that day . Tidying up the science lab , Godber thoughtlessly puts a bottle of nitric acid in a box of rubbish bound for the incinerator . When Price realises this , he panics . The school is evacuated . But two pupils are missing - Daisy and Celia . They are in the incinerator room with Smithy , and all are unaware of the danger they are in . . . The title is recognisable to ' Nearest & Dearest ' fans as one of Hylda Baker's numerous catchphrases . An appearance by Hylda herself would have saved this boring Rowley and Baker episode . Once again Charles Bolton's ' Godber ' is given unwarranted screen time . What on earth made the writers think his ' Gumby'-style character was more interesting than the other 5C pupils ? Poor Miss Petting is clearly heading for a nervous breakdown . In the short time she's been in the show , she's shed more tears than Maureen Bullock managed in the first three years . Mr . Hurst gets to play the hero at the end by going back to rescue Smithy and the girls , the sort of thing Hedges might have done . Funniest moment - Potter trying to do karate on Godber !
Not One Of Mary's Favourites	No , this wasn't a spin-off from ' Rising Damp ' . This Miss Jones was a young mum from London , played by Paula Wilcox , bringing up her child alone after the father , a Fleet Street journalist , does a runner ( the swine ! ) . Richard Waring specialised in forgettable , middle-of-the-road domestic sitcoms , such as ' Not In Front Of The Children ' , and this was more of the same . Miss Jones was middle-class , had a trendy flat , wall-to-wall friends , and a sympathetic neighbour ( Christopher Beeny ) who carried a torch for her . It was twee , sickly , unreal . Yet , amazingly , it attracted the wrath of Mary Whitehouse ! The Great Mary ( who'd also railed against that other sinful show ' Robin's Nest ' ) thought that single parenthood was not a fit subject for comedy and publicly complained before it went on air . After only two seasons , the show ended and the world got back to normal . The theme tune by the late Roger Webb was identical to one he'd written for a 1974 soft-porn film called ' The Amorous Milkman ' ) !
" But I've had mumps ! "	Examining one of Collier's patients ( an obstinate old woman demanding a second opinion ) , Upton keels over . He has the symptoms of mumps , and is admitted to St . Swithins as a patient . Unfortunately , he is on Bingham's ward , and finds himself next to Mr . Gilbert , an annoying man who fancies he knows more about medicine than the doctors . Gilbert's brother Jimbo is just as bad . Upton takes a shine to nurse Allison , and begins chatting her up . Bingham fancies her too , and sets about trying to break the pair up . . . In a sitcom with a run of twenty-nine episodes , there was bound to be at least one major clunker , and this is it . Too much time is given over to ghastly Mr . Gilbert and his brother , not enough on the regulars . Gilbert seems to have been based on the ' Wendover ' character ( played by Arthur Haynes ) from the 1966 film ' Doctor In Clover ' , but James Bree ( a fine support actor ) isn't capable of making him remotely amusing or likable . Even Richard O'Sullivan's ' Bingham ' grates here . Notable mainly for the appearance of Angela Douglas as ' Allison ' . She was the wife of Kenneth More , who played ' Richard Grimsdyke ' in the original ' Doctor In The House ' movie . Funniest moment - Bingham realising he has mumps !
" What have you got ? A bingo line ! "	After a run of four excellent episodes , it was back down to Earth with a bump with this one , which barely has a single funny moment in it . It begins in Bingham's ward , where Duncan is showing around some students . He tries to examine elderly patient Mr . Hutton , but then Bingham appears , with more students in tow , and they begin arguing over who has the right to examine the old man first . Dick and Paul show up and the row escalates . Loftus commissions the doctors to devise a new system for patient inspection . Duncan's version seems to be the best , involving the use of coloured magnetic counters on a blackboard . But predictably even this new system winds up going wrong . . . That's all the plot this Graham Chapman and Bernard McKenna scripted episode contains , pretty thin even for a twenty-five minute show . No guest-stars either . If you find the sight of doctors bickering amusing , however , it might be right up your street . Trying to find the funniest moment here was not easy , but the oft-repeated gag of Loftus wandering into the operating theatre just as the doctors are taking the rise out of him is trotted out yet again , and thank goodness for that , otherwise there would have been nothing to laugh at .
Sid's Half-Hour !	Sidney Balmoral James is one of life's losers . Every penny he gets he gambles , but never seems to win anything back . Ditto his Antipodean friend , pool hustler Bill . Sid's fiancée , club owner Liz , seems to be single-handedly supporting him . Then he comes up with what he thinks is a sure fire way to make easy money - he puts all his money on a waiter named Chester to win a forthcoming race , then makes it appear as though Chester has a bad limp , meaning no-one else bets on him . There's only one flaw to Sid's foolproof plan - Chester's liking for alcohol . Following the break-up of Tony Hancock and Sid James ( initiated by the former ) , Alan Simpson and Ray Galton gave Sid his own show , with him essentially portraying the same character , a charming opportunist , always on the lookout for ' readies ' without having to work for them . Bill Kerr had been in the radio version of ' Hancock's Half-Hour ' , but was not used in the television series . The lovely Liz Fraser was also in several ' Hancock ' episodes . From the moment Sid is seen walking down a street to the accompaniment of a tuba not unlike the one heard over the ' Hancock ' titles , its clear that the show was modelled on its parent as closely as possible . I saw this episode , courtesy of the B . B . C . ' s Archive Trial and , while I enjoyed it on the whole , it came nowhere near the standard of the Hancock series . The bet rigging plot has been flogged to death in numerous other shows over the years . Sid looks lost without Tony to play off against , though Kerr and Fraser do their best . Sid went on to do much better shows , notably ' Two In Clover ' and ' Bless This House ' . That fine character actor John Bluthal is seen as ' Charlie ' , who keeps Sid well supplied with salt beef sandwiches and pickled gherkins ( amazing Liz wants to marry him when he lives on such a diet ) . Sidney Tafler crops up as a shady bookie . Funniest moment - Sid's opening monologue where he describes his friends . Focusing on the Australian , he says : " He came over for the Victory Parade , but got lost ! " .
" Very well , thank you ! "	Lovable , bumbling Harry Worth is barely remembered now , yet in the ' 60's and ' 70's he was one of British television's brightest comedy stars . With his trademark trilby and spectacles , he was a walking disaster area . This Yorkshire T . V . sitcom cast him as Harry Matthews , a middle-aged widower struggling to raise two children - the good-looking Martin , and Shirley , a precocious schoolgirl . It was not easy . As Harry sang each week : " She's growing up so incredibly fast , he seems to think I live in the past ' . It was basically ' Father Dear Father ' by another name , even the title was the same as a Michael Robbins I . T . V . sitcom from 1975 . In the first episode , Harry is concerned at the prospect of Martin dating an older woman . A later ( and rather funny ) instalment saw Shirley announce her wedding to a drippy mummy's boy . Fanny Carby played a nosey next-door neighbour ( as she seemed to do in most I . T . V . sitcoms of the period ) . Harry for the most part was in fine form , although a little unsteady in some scenes ( absentmindedly referring to Shirley as Debby in one episode ) . It was cosy domestic sitcom fare - the sets were cardboard , the plots contrived , the characters too nice to be credible - far removed from the awfulness of the real world . Maybe that was why it was so enjoyable .
Harry In Search Of Kip	Sometimes the past is best left undisturbed . This picture was a favourite of mine and used to play often on 70's television , usually in a late-night slot . I had thought of it as a tense , gritty movie full of exciting action and superb performances . Then it mysteriously disappeared from our screens , so when the opportunity arose recently to view it once again , I jumped at the chance . Oh dear . Based on the novel ' The Ordeal Of Major Grigsby ' by John Sherlock , ' The Last Grenade ' begins in the Congo . A mercenary unit , headed by Major Harry Grigsby ( Stanley Baker ) , is waiting to be picked up by a helicopter by one of their number , Kip Thompson ( Alex Cord ) . Instead he has changed sides and wipes them out en masse - laughing like a maniac as he does so - before blowing up their camp for good measure . Only Grigsby survives , swearing revenge . Some time later , he is back in England and recovering from tuberculosis in a sanitarium when the British Government ( naturally bothered by an American mercenary's activities in a foreign land ) asks him to kill Thompson who has been making a nuisance of himself in China by making cross border raids . You would think they would prefer to use someone in better health , but that's politicians for you . Taking along other mercenaries - including Julian Glover and John Thaw ( criminally wasted in such a small role ) , he sets about hunting for his hated adversary . They eventually meet , but instead of killing Grigsby where he stands , Thompson puts him in solitary confinement , from which he is able to escape easily . This lapse in logic is not isolated ; as the film progresses , other opportunities crop up for Thompson to remove Grigsby , but for reasons unexplained , he chooses not to do so . We know of course why - the story would have ended there and then . Harry then begins an affair with Katherine ( Honor Blackman ) , the good-looking wife of General Whiteley ( Richard Attenborough - also wasted in this movie ) , and considers calling off the search for Thompson ( forgetting of course that he has been paid to do the job by British tax-payers ) and settle down to a life of domestic bliss . Thompson has other ideas and kills Katherine ( he was really after her husband , but never mind ) . So now Harry is full of fury once more , and storms off into the rainy forests to look for Kip . You think a big fight is coming , but no , it does not and suddenly the credits are rolling up the screen . Watching this the other night I wondered how on earth the writers - one of whom was James Mitchell , creator of ' Callan ' - thought that they could get away with such blatantly obvious plot holes , some of which are big enough for Thompson to fly his helicopter through . Even my wife ( a confirmed soap opera addict ) spotted them , which tells you all you need to know . Baker makes a convincing mercenary - all moustache and muscles , upper lip trembling in anticipation of the final kill - more so than the cast of ' The Wild Geese ' combined . Harry using a corpse as a trap for Thompson is in character , but his decision to stop hunting for Thompson to move in with Katherine is not . As the giggling psycho , Alex Cord's performance surely must have been a big influence on Christopher Walken when he played ' Max Zorin ' in the Bond movie ' A View To A Kill ' fifteen years later . Ray Brooks is around too , but got better dialogue when he did ' Mr . Benn ' . On the plus side , there is impressive location filming in Spain ( doubling for the Congo ) and China . The opening massacre gets the film off to a thundering start . But from then on , it is all downhill , as the plot wanders around in circles . We do not even get to see Grigsby and Thompson engage in hand-to-hand combat . Gordon Flemyng , the director , was also responsible for the two ' Dr . Who ' movies of the ' 60's starring Peter Cushing , and you will find more excitement in those than this . If you enjoyed ' The Last Grenade ' in 1970 , then to preserve your happy memories do not watch it now . Believe me , ' The Wild Geese ' is ' Apocalypse Now ' by comparison .
" Its time to go Nationwide ! "	It seems odd to denounce the ' 70's as ' a time best forgotten ' then keep our memories alive by reviewing its television programmes . In the last episode of ' Life On Mars ' , Sam Tyler ( John Simm ) killed himself by jumping off a roof because he wanted to return there . I have a far easier option - I watch D . V . D . ' s . ' Nationwide ' went out after the regional evening news and before the light entertainment programmes on B . B . C . - 1 . Each edition started with the presenter ( either Michael Barrett or Frank Bough ) seated before a bank of screens , on which could be seen the face of a local newsreader . Topics ranged from issues of the day such as the Budget or the death of a world leader to showbiz interviews . ' Down Memory Lane ' was a short-lived feature which exploited a fad for nostalgia triggered by shows such as ' Upstairs , Downstairs ' . Later on Richard Stilgoe and Valerie Singleton fronted a weekly consumer guide which became the forerunner to ' Watchdog ' . ' The British Rock & Pop Awards ' blasted the show into the ' 80's . In common with ' Pebble Mill At One ' , ' Nationwide ' tried to be something to everyone . It was frequently naff , but light and easy to digest . Ideal for unwinding to after a tiring day . I can recall cringing with embarrassment though when they wheeled in thriller writer Francis Durbridge and invited him to speculate on who had shot J . R . Ewing . He had obviously not seen ' Dallas ' , and was plainly out of his depth here . Another ' dearie me , did they really say that ? ' moment occurred in 1973 when a cake shop in Bournemouth was apparently commissioned to bake Princess Anne and Captain Mark Phillips ' wedding cake . We were shown in great detail the preparation and hard work that went into its making . Had ' Ceefax ' been around then , the recipe would have been on page 447 . The staff looked pleased as punch , like Mrs . Bridges in ' Upstairs , Downstairs ' when King Edward The Seventh came to dinner . However , on the day itself , viewers were informed the British Army had made the cake instead . Did someone at the Beeb boob ? The cracking signature tune was by John Scott . Some decent presenters ( including luscious long-legged Sue Lawley ) got their start here and the show had the occasional memorable moment such as Margaret Thatcher being put on the spot by schoolteacher Diana Gould over the sinking of the Belgrano . Giving air-time to talentless people ? Well , reality television is now doing that on a far grander scale . Michael Barrett was not alone in sending himself up on ' The Goodies ' . Tony Blackburn and Michael Aspel did as much . Stanley Baxter produced a funny send-up of ' Nationwide ' in one of his legendary Christmas shows . The L . W . T . show ' End Of Part One ' went for the jugular with ' Nationtrite ' , hosted by Sue Straightman ( Sue Holderness ) . When ' Nationwide ' finally ended in 1983 , its successor was the hugely unpopular ' Sixty Minutes ' , hosted by Sarah Kennedy . It was spoofed a year later by the I . T . V . comedy show ' The Steam Video Company ' as ' Nationwide With The Furniture Rearranged ' .
Enchanting April	Such was the popularity of ' The Man From U . N . C . L . E . ' in 1965 that a spin-off was planned . An episode of the second series - ' The Moonglow Affair ' - saw Solo and Kuryakin temporarily written out , and their places taken by agents ' April Dancer ' and ' Mark Slate ' , played by Mary Ann Mobley and Norman Fell respectfully . It did well , and a series was commissioned - but with two important changes . The lead roles were recast ; in came a young Stefanie Powers as ' Dancer ' and British actor Noel Harrison ( son of Rex ) as ' Slate ' . Leo G . Carroll , of course , played ' Mr . Waverly ' . I did not see this when it first went out , but viewed it recently . It is enjoyably daft hokum , with plots involving such unlikely ideas as a dog's fleas used to carry a microdot , a Kali statue coming to life and throwing daggers , the entrance to the lost city of Atlantis turning out to be in some caves in the Caribbean , an island colony of shipwrecked survivors , a health spa that makes its customers youthful , and Boris Karloff ( in drag ) as the head of a gang of killers who wear flat caps and speak bad Cockney . This hailed from the same era as ' The Monkees ' and ' Batman ' , and it shows . Powers is beautiful and glamorous , though it is a pity that ' April ' was not given more to do in the action department . In the last episode I saw ( ' The U . N . C . L . E . Samurai Affair ' ) , she was attacked by a frogman , and after putting up token resistance , went to hide while Slate dealt with him . She should have chucked him over her shoulder the way Mrs . Peel did in ' The Avengers ' . It does seem bizarre to call a show ' The Girl From U . N . C . L . E . ' and then depict its main character as a helpless bimbo heavily reliant on a male sidekick . Another mistake was the reuse of Jerry Goldsmith's ' Man From U . N . C . L . E . ' theme , here given a trendy new arrangement . I warmed more to Harrison's ' Slate ' . Obviously intended to be the show's answer to David McCallum , he is rather good as a foppish hero in the ' Jason King ' mold . But whose idea was it to cast a teenage boy ( ' Randy Kirby ' ) as an U . N . C . L . E . agent ? Robert Vaughn played ' Solo ' in ' The Mother Muffin Affair ' , at exactly the same time Harrison was guesting on the parent show . In the U . K . , ' Girl ' was shown in rotation with ' Man ' , but in the U . S . A . , they were screened more or less together . Viewers found two ' U . N . C . L . E . ' shows a week a bit much to take , and ' Girl ' was dropped after a single season . Less comedy and more action ( for April ) would have been beneficial for the show . Sam Rolfe's superb first season of ' Man ' should have been the blueprint for ' Girl ' . Best episode - ' The Atlantis Affair ' ( written by ' I am Legend ' author Richard Matheson ) Worst episode - ' The Paradise Lost Affair ' .
C'mon everybody , its gibbon time !	Once again , the Goodies are out of work . Then a mysterious woman claiming to be a witch - named Hazel , of course - turns up at their offices , wishing to conduct a seance . Thinking her a raving lunatic , the Goodies accede to her request . As the witch repeatedly cries out " Is anyone there ? " , they humour her by putting on daft voices . But Graeme becomes possessed by an evil force , and starts a coven which Tim and Bill try to infiltrate by pretending to be sacrificial virgins . . . Made just prior to the phenomenal popularity of ' The Exorcist ' and other Satanic ' 70's shockers , this episode is more of a parody of Hammer horror , in particular ' The Devil Rides Out ' . Then , as now , the British tabloids were obsessed with lurid tales of witchcraft in the suburbs , mainly because it provided an excuse to run photos of bare bums ! The late , much-missed Patricia Hayes enjoys herself hugely as the cackling witch . ' Stuff That Gibbon ' is actually a catchier song than the Goodies ' later hit ' The Funky Gibbon ' . Funniest moment - Graeme conjuring up the Devil . It turns out to be none other than David Frost !
" Is everybody anarchy ? "	Upton is summoned to the Dean's office . A photo in a newspaper shows him participating in a students ' protest . It looks as though Upton faces expulsion from St . Swithins until Loftus points out that the picture was , in fact , taken in New York . Upton was at the Dean's tea party the day before , a fact the old duffer had forgotten . The hospital is invaded by hippies protesting about declining education standards . Duncan and the gang take the rise out of them mercilessly . Loftus tries to quell the protest but is himself arrested . . . Topical episode from Garden & Oddie . Student protests were worldwide at the time , thanks to the Vietnam war . It is unfortunate though that the protesters here include a smattering of ethnic groups , making Duncan and co . ' s mocking of them seem slightly racist . No Briddock , Evans and Collier either . Funniest moment - despite their mockery of the earlier protest , Upton and the others stage one of their own to complain about Loftus ' arrest !
Billy Fancies A Foot !	Billy is dating sexy art student Sandra Bullock ( no relation ! ) . He tells her that his grandmother is a leading art critic , so she hands over an erotic painting entitled ' Lust ' , and asks for his grandmother's opinion . Later , Billy's dad finds the picture and is so shocked he throws it into the dustbin . Then Sandra turns up , demanding the picture back . . . The stunningly beautiful Moira Foot is best remembered for her role as ' Effie ' the whispering mind in Ronnie Barker's ' Hark At Barker ' ( 1969 ) and its sequel , ' His Lordship Entertains ' ( 1972 ) . She cropped up in other comedy shows , such as the ' Doctor At Large ' episode ' Cynthia Darling ' , ' The Benny Hill Show ' , and as ' Denise Laroque ' in ' Allo , Allo ' . Here she plays Billy's art student girlfriend . In one scene she paints him in the nude - unfortunately , she isn't the one in the buff . Its part of a fantasy sequence in which Billy imagines himself as Touloise Latrec . Funniest moment - Billy as a French Resistance fighter blowing up a dustbin to the accompaniment to Robert Farnon's ' Colditz ' theme !
" Get ' em off then ! "	A game of Monopoly in the Fisher household turns into a blazing family row . Mr and Mrs . Fisher decide to go to the pub , leaving Billy alone with Barbara . Well , not quite , because his grandmother is there too , but Billy isn't concerned about her . He senses a golden opportunity to get his fiancée into bed . Whilst Barbara is making tea , Billy throws a jug of milk over her skirt , and tells her to go upstairs and slip out of her wet garments . She does so , and Billy strips off too , even though he is bone dry . Before Billy can have his evil way , however , his mother and family come home unexpectedly early . . . Yes , well we've all been here , haven't we ? This episode rings true with those of us who remember the golden days of courtship . Taking a girl out in those days was like driving a car with one foot on the accelerator and another on the brake ! Because ' Billy Liar ' went out post-watershed on a Saturday night ( at least in its first season ) , it was able to be a bit racier than most other sitcoms . No nudity as such , but we do get a fantasy sequence in which Billy imagines playing strip poker with Barbara , and gets her down to her underwear . Sally Watts is indeed a very well endowed young lady . Funniest moment - a ' Star Trek ' spoof in which Billy , as Captain Kirk , uses a phaser to zap his parents ! Then Mr . Shadrack materialises as ' Mr . Spock ' !
" I'm a looney ! "	John Cleese , in need of money following a disastrous business venture , accepted Humphrey Barclay's offer to write several episodes of ' Doctor At Large ' in 1971 . Among them was the classic ' No Ill Feeling ! ' , later to inspire ' Fawlty Towers ' . Also that year Cleese penned this episode of ' Six Dates With Barker ' . Ronnie plays ' Dr . Swanton ' , a money-grabbing psychiatrist who gets a visit from the gas man ( Michael Bates ) . Only he is not really a gas man , but someone with dreadful psychological problems . He claims he is being followed everywhere by a little man in a Robin Hood hat with binoculars . Swanton tries to assure him the watcher is only a figment of his imagination , and appears to be having some success , but then , bizarrely , he starts seeing him as well . . . Remember the ' Argument ' sketch from ' Monty Python's Flying Circus ' ? Blow that up into ten times its length and you have this . It is basically a two-hander with Bates ' character protesting he must be a looney and Ronnie's trying to persuade him he is not . As was the case with ' All The World's A Stooge ' , the joke wears off quickly and the episode is left all at sea . I loved the ending though ! Energetic work from the late Michael Bates as the paranoid gas man . I do wish Network would release ' Turnbull's Finest Half-Hour ' on D . V . D . as it featured one of his very best performances ( check out my I . M . D . B . review for my thoughts on the show ) . Funniest moment - Dr . Swanton trying to prove the imaginary man really exists by tipping him upside down .
" I am not eating that ! It is stolen ! "	Eagle-eyed Blakey notices that the new canteen girl , Suzy , is giving him significantly smaller portions of food ( for the same money ) than Jack and Stan . Furthermore , Stan is taking home left-overs such as sausages and cheese . Suzy has a thing going with Jack and seems to fancy Stan too . Blakey sacks Suzy and replaces her with the ex-prison guard ( and noticeably less attractive ) Gladys . Desperate to feed his family ( apart from Arthur , who refuses to touch what he regards as stolen food ) , Stan uses his charm on her , but he has not reckoned on Gladys being so sex starved . . . Good old Andria Lawrence . Here she is again , blonde and brassy , cast as your everyday nymphomaniac . The same year this episode was made , she was also be found in the ' On The Buses ' movie , playing ' turnaround ' Betty . A charming woman , and attractive to boot . Also to be found here is Fanny Carby , the archetypal ' nosey neighbour ' of numerous ' 70's sitcoms such as Harry Worth's ' How's Your Father ' . Odd to see her also playing a woman having difficulty keeping her knickers on , but there you go . Luan Peters , who crops at the end as ' Joan ' , is remembered by comedy fans as that Aussie woman whom John Cleese accidentally groped in a classic instalment ( aren't they all ? ) of ' Fawlty Towers ' . Good episode , particularly when Stan tries to conceal his guilt by eating hot sausages as quickly as possible . Funniest moment - the smile on Blakey's face vanishing when Stan and Jack stumble on a way to fool the new vending machines into giving them free food !
Stan Butler - Time Traveller ?	Stan is showing Mum and Olive around a local transport museum . He falls asleep at the wheel of a vintage omnibus , and dreams that he is living 100 years in the past , and still a bus driver . Olive is a would-be suffragette , Mum is a washerwoman , Jack is a Luddite opposed to the fitting of engines in the omnibuses , while Blakey is . . . as appalling as ever . Did you think ' Life On Mars ' was original ? Well , here , its Stan Butler who goes the Sam Tyler route of waking up in the past . The change of setting makes this an unusual and enjoyable episode from the pens of Bob Grant and Stephen Lewis . Nice period flavour too . Funniest moment - Stan driving under a low bridge and leaving Blakey suspended by his fingertips !
In Praise Of Older Doctors	Paul Collier lands a job as a ' television doctor ' - dispensing medical advice to breakfast television viewers . His popularity makes him an instant celebrity , and soon he is knee deep in fan mail from adoring women . His colleagues , particularly Snell , are disgusted , not to say incredibly jealous . A bitter argument breaks out concerning Collier's penchant for seducing women half his age . Then he announces his engagement to a young American researcher , and the you-know-what really hits the fan . . . Bill Oddie's script owes a debt to two classic ' Doctor ' episodes - ' Doctor On The Box ' from ' In The House ' , and ' Pull The Other One ' from ' At Large ' . It tackles the subject of the male menopause rather well . Waring and Stuart-Clark's girl-chasing days are long behind them , but Collier appears to be having the time of his life . As well as the fame acquired from his television exposure , he seems to have weathered the passing of time better than the others . No wonder they hate him . Its only when Rebecca accidentally records an open admission by Collier's fiancée that she only wants to marry him to stay in the U . K . does he realise he has been had . Collier's television persona was obviously based on Dr . Hilary Jones , another good-looking G . P . also to be found doling out practical medical advice from the breakfast television sofa at that time . A key problem with the show is highlighted here - the laugh track . The classic show had one , but the humour was on a slightly different level to ' At The Top ' . Here many good lines play to total silence from the studio audience , which is a shame . Funniest moment - Collier is walking down a corridor when a man on a stretcher cries out . Thinking the man to be in pain , Paul goes to see what the trouble is . It turns out the patient wants an autograph !
" Ah , there you are "	This was Ronnie Barker's second sitcom ( his first being the comedy anthology series ' The Ronnie Barker Playhouse ' ) . It cast him as ' Lord Rustless ' , the doddery old buffoon ( based on the comedian Fred Emney ) who lives at Chrome Hall , grows mustard and cress for a living , and seems to be fond of women and having a tipple . His staff includes the pompous butler ' Badger ' ( Frank Gatliff ) , a toothless Cook ( Mary Baxter ) , the spinster secretary ' Mildred Bates ' ( Josephine Tewson ) , the ' between-floors parlour maid ' Effie ( Moira Foot ) , and a 100 year-old gardener called ' Dithers ' ( an unrecognisable David Jason ) . Effie never spoke ( only whispered inaudibly ) , while Dithers ' dialogue was pure Worzel Gummidge-style gobble-de-gook . Ronnie later described ' Rustless ' as his second favourite character , the first being ' Fletcher ' of ' Porridge ' . The show was the creation of Alan Owen , and grew out of an episode of ' Playhouse ' broadcast on / 68 entitled ' Ah , There You Are ' . Owen was unavailable to write the series , so the job went to Alan Ayckbourn ( under the name ' Peter Caulfield ' ) , later to become acclaimed as one of Britain's finest playwrights . The show was ground breaking in two notable respects ; firstly , Lord Rustless ' habit of addressing the audience directly ( a device later known as ' breaking the fourth wall ' ) , and the interruption of the plot with sketches ( some by Ronnie himself under his ' Gerald Wiley ' alias ) , many of which would be remade for ' The Two Ronnies ' . The second season had a different theme each week , such as ' Law ' , ' Cooking ' , ' Do-It-Yourself ' , and ' Music ' , with Rustless trying his hand at each but failing dismally . Two series were made in all . Having viewed these recently , I found much to enjoy , even though it had not stood up as well as I had hoped . The sketches were the best part of the programme , standing out like raisins in an undercooked scone . Ronnie stayed with L . W . T . for ' Six Dates With Barker ' , and then it was off to the B . B . C . for ' The Two Ronnies ' , ' Seven Of One ' , ' Porridge ' , and ' Open All Hours ' , every one a classic . But the end of ' Hark At Barker ' did not mean the end of Lord Rustless . Ronnie resurrected him - and his staff - for ' His Lordship Entertains ' in 1972 . It was an altogether different show ; the sketches were gone , Ronnie wrote the scripts himself , reformatting the concept so that Chrome Hall was now a country hotel . There was location filming , and other characters got to interact with Rustless and co . Ronnie later described it as ' Fawlty Towers Mark One ' . Not a trace of ' Entertains ' survives in the B . B . C . archives , which is indeed unfortunate as it is the better show . Luckily , the scripts are to be found in Ronnie's book ' All I Ever Wrote ' .
Reggie's Return	Like many , when I heard the B . B . C . was proposing to remake ' The Fall & Rise of Reginald Perrin ' ( which ran from 1976-78 ) , I was horrified . We have become used to bad Hollywood remakes ( particularly sci-fi ones , which drench themselves in C . G . I . in a futile effort to conceal their lack of originality ) , but now British television is getting in on the act . The precedent was set last year when the Corporation served up a tepid , logic-free ' reimagining ' of Terry Nation's ' Survivors ' which if nothing else only further enhanced the original's reputation . My hostility subsided a little when I learnt that David Nobbs would be involved in the project , working alongside ' Men Behaving Badly ' creator Simon Nye . Nobbs ' reasoning ( as explained on his website ) was that we needed a new version because the world had changed so much since 1976 . I then re-read the books and found there was a lot of funny stuff in them not used by the original , such as Reggie's daughter Linda's incestuous relationship with his fanatical right-wing brother-in-law Jimmy . A remake therefore seemed perfectly viable . So what did I make of the first show ? Alright . Not bad , but above average for B . B . C . - 1 these days . Reggie now works for ' Groomtech ' , a firm specialising in products for men such as after-shaves and razors ( ' Sunshine Desserts ' featured briefly as Reggie passed it on the way to work ) . Like the Reggie of old , the train is always 11 minutes late , he has a domineering boss ( ' Chris Jackson ' ) , two annoying yes-men are always floating about the office , and Reggie is bored by the futility of his existence . The jokes may be new , but the premise is the same . Clunes was good , making no effort to copy Leonard Rossiter , and delivered his one-liners with the right degree of venom . I laughed when he dreamt of telling the man on the train : " Your shoes are on fire , and I'm sleeping with your wife ! " . Keeping Reggie's flights of fancy was another wise move . However , they erred in not properly establishing a starting point for Reggie's madness . The first episode of the original began with a typical day in Reggie's life , then after insulting his mother-in-law everything changes . They should have done that here . Reggie instead came across as unnecessarily rude . We were not given a chance to see just what he was rebelling against . No awful mother-in-law , but a dippy secretary ( a stereotype even in 1976 ) . The original Reggie once claimed that the sight of a pumice stone would be likely to give him hysterics . Unfortunately , the new version was saddled with the impossible job of marketing it for the man who likes to look good . He also fancied the pants off attractive colleague Jasmine Strauss ( Lucy Liemann ) . The loving relationship the old Reggie had with Elisabeth ( Pauline Yates ) has been replaced by a cold , formal one with the independent Nicola ( Fay Ripley ) . The laugh-track should have been dispensed with . At times I thought I was watching ' A Sharp Intake Of Breath ' starring David Jason ( it was that intrusive ) . Also why has the late , great Ronnie Hazlehurst not been credited with the theme music ? These flaws aside , I did like it and will be watching next week . But it could and should have been better .
The Price Of Love	Mr . Cromwell has a new secretary - the sexy Miss Patricia Knightley . The whole school falls under her spell , in particular Mr . Price , who is reminded of a girl from the Valleys called ' Blodwyn ' . Each time he claps eyes on her , he hears a Welsh male voice choir singing ' All Through The Night ' . So he tries to woo her . But there's a snag - Patricia is a ' friend ' of the Chairman Of The Board Of Govenors . . . Back in the days when he was funny , Harry Enfield did a sketch in which ' Kevin ' and ' Perry ' are smitten by a good-looking teacher , played by Lynsey Baxter . Here is an earlier version of the same idea , penned by Geoff Rowley and Andy Baker . Madeleine Mills will be familiar to ' On The Buses ' fans because she appeared in three episodes ; ' Vacancy for Inspector ' , ' The Inspector's Niece ' and ' Going Steady ' . She was certainly sexy , and its not hard to believe she could mesmerize an entire school's menfolk . This is a different ' niece ' to the one the Chairman had in ' The Pruning Of Hedges ' ; the other one was called ' Rita ' and was played by Wendy Richard . Richard Davies walks off with the acting honours here , his big scene when he angrily confronts Cromwell and the Chairman is powerfully done . Of course his passion for Patricia goes unrequited . But there's a happy ending as the teachers toast Potter's birthday in the staff room . With the series end imminent , it seems symbolic . Funniest moment - Price and Patricia having a quiet drink together . " Bottoms up ! " , exclaims the secretary . Jumping to the wrong conclusion , Price replies : " Oh yes , please ! " .
" Hello , Dotty ! "	Harold has fallen asleep while waiting for his father to come home . An unusually well dressed Albert steps in out of the pouring rain , and reveals he has been to see a spiritualist called Madame Fontana . Harold laughs at his father's gullibility : " Its some old boiler doing a Mike Yarwood ! " . To prove it is all true , Harold agrees to a little experiment involving a Ouija board and a glass . But Harold decides to have a bit of fun by pretending that Hitler wishes to speak to the old man . Albert wants to stage a séance in the Steptoe house in the hope that it might enable him to contact his late wife . Albert has been getting friendly with a widow named Dorothy , and wants to ask for permission to remarry . . . Another ' Steptoe ' movie spoof , this time of Bryan Forbes ' 1964 film ' Seance On A Wet Afternoon ' which starred Richard Attenborough . Only the séance aspect of the plot is used , however . Patricia Routledge is ' Madame Fontana ' , a role she plays in much the same way as ' Audrey Watt ' , the white witch in the ' Doctor At Large ' episode ' Its All In The Mind ' from 1971 . Her vocal talents are put to good use here . She openly fancies Harold , causing him to refer to her as ' Fiona Richmond ' , named after the ' 70's porn star . Its an okay episode , but did not deserve to be the very last one of all , which it sadly was ( apart from that year's Christmas Special and another movie ) . The ' 70's revival of ' Steptoe & Son ' proved an unqualified success , but the time had arrived to bring it to a close . It is alarming to think that , had it never happened , ' Steptoe ' would most likely have been forgotten as black and white shows were rarely repeated after the introduction of colour . Funniest moment - Harold using the Ouija board to spell out the following message for his father ; ' You Are A Silly Turd ! '
Home Time	Doris Ewell has married Mr . Sibley , but has no time for a honeymoon as she is snowed under with work . But her new husband has a surprise for her - he has booked a week in Tunisia . Potter , meanwhile , is bragging about how rock-solid his marriage to Ruby is . He is therefore astonished when a note on his kitchen table informs him that his wife has run away as she cannot stand him any longer . The caretaker arranges to meet Ruby at ' our place ' , but takes this to mean the place where they first met , now a seedy strip-joint . As the clock ticks away , Doris and Sibley rush to catch their plane , with the Fenn Street teachers in tow . . . Season 4 of ' Please Sir ! ' is a mixed bag ; following the departure of the original 5C and ' Bernard Hedges ' , various new characters were tried out . ' Ffitchett-Brown ' would have worked with better scripts . Classes 4C and 5C were truly horrid . Things worsened with the merger between the Fenn Street and Weaver Street schools , and the arrival of ' Mr . Hurst ' and ' Miss Petting ' . Terry , Godber , Des , Daisy and Celia were no match for the old line-up . John Hurst was more like Hedges than Ffitchett-Brown had been , but again suffered from being given little to do . Nervous ' Gloria Petting ' provided some much-needed laughs as Cromwell's new love interest . L . W . T . obviously decided that ' Please Sir ! ' did not work without Hedges and the old 5C , hence no fifth series . As the axe fell on its parent show , ' The Fenn Street Gang ' sailed on , occasionally allowing for guest appearances from the likes of ' Smithy ' and ' Price ' ( ' Rough Justice ' ) , and the ' Look-In ' comic strip lasted until 1973 . Deryck Guyler went straight from this into the B . B . C . ' s revival of ' Sykes ' . On Christmas Day 1976 , the ' Please Sir ! ' movie premiered on I . T . V . in a post-Queen's Speech slot . In the mid-'80's , I . T . V . repeated the second season on Saturday afternoons along with ' On The Buses ' in the slot vacated by the recently cancelled ' World Of Sport ' . Channel 4 considered the show important enough to include as part of its ' T . V . Heaven ' series in 1991 . The episode chosen was ' The Welcome Mat ' . ' Please Sir ! ' , while never a classic , gave enjoyment to a lot of people , and for that reason alone , deserves to be fondly remembered .
The Joke's On Us	Millions watched this every Sunday evening ( including myself ) , mainly to laugh at the clips of horrible foreign programmes such as ' Endurance ' , ' Ultra Quiz ' and ' The Price Is Right ' . Back in the early ' 80's , we could safely laugh in the knowledge that our television was the best in the world . Clive made an excellent presenter , erudite as well as witty . Unfortunately , British producers then thought it would be a great idea to copy the programmes being ridiculed . The three listed above were subsequently adapted for British audiences . Twenty-odd years later , our television is indistinguishable from the infantile dross Clive regularly used to make fun of . Noisy , game-show contestants prepared to make utter fools of themselves , hyper-active hosts , tacky sets , live insects consumed with relish by publicity-seeking idiots , we've got them all . Worse , Clive isn't around to mock them . Hasn't the ' joke ' rather backfired somewhat ?
" In my day , you couldn't ride until you'd been born ! "	Tim visits his great ( and fabulously rich ) Uncle Butcher at Tally-Ho Towers . Scenting money in the air , Bill and Graeme go with him . Uncle Butcher looks like Jimmy Edwards , walks side-saddle and is obsessed by fox hunting . During a hunt , he drops dead , so the Goodies mount his head on a wall in the study . Tim inherits the family estate - which he plans to turn into a fox hunters ' paradise . The others get jobs as domestic servants , hoping to restore his personality . . . Tim Brooke-Taylor plays two roles - ' Tim ' and ' Uncle Butcher ' . As soon as he inherits the estate , he changes into a parody of his uncle . Thirty years before the ban on fox hunting , ' The Goodies ' called for it by portraying its exponents as overweight , drunken cretins with too much time on their hands . They weren't finished with them either ; the opening scene of the Season Seven episode ' Dodonuts ' similarly ridicules the gentry . Funniest scene - Tim receiving aversion therapy to fox hunting . GRAEME : Do you like fox hunting ? TIM : Yes . ( Whacks him over head with mallet )
Death In Paradise	My copy of this episode lists the title as ' One On An Island ' . Where the desert came from I have no idea . Possibly it was used on different prints . It was based on a story by Donald E . Westlake , who as ' Richard Stark ' wrote the classic crime novel ' Point Blank ' and its numerous sequels . Brandon De Wilde is ' Alec Worthing ' , a banker who uses his inheritance to buy a boat , which he names ' The Victoria ' , in honour of his dead mother . He intends travelling the world . During a gale , the boat is wrecked , marooning him on a tropical island , whose only other inhabitants appear to be goats . With no hope of rescue , Alec grows used to his new home , but experiences agonising loneliness . One day , he sees a beautiful girl stepping out of the sea . She is called Vicki , the sole survivor of a ship wreck . Alec and Vicki become lovers . But a serpent enters this Eden in the shape of ' Joe ' , a pilot washed ashore in a dinghy . Alec worries that Vicki will be attracted to him . Keeping her out of sight , he murders the interloper and conceals the body . . . Like ' Eve ' , this is also about a loser who seeks refuge in a fantasy world . When it transpires that Vicki has the same name as Alec's late mother , I thought for one moment she was going to turn out to be a reincarnation , in which case an element of incest would have arisen , definitely unsuitable for 1969 television audiences . Thankfully that's not the case . Suzanna Leigh is the gorgeous ' Vicki ' ; among her other credits are the Bulldog Drummond adventure ' Deadlier than The Male ' from 1966 . David Bauer , cast as ' Uncle George ' , cropped up an awful lot in I . T . C . shows such as ' The Saint ' and ' The Prisoner ' . I have no idea where it was filmed , but it looks like they used a real island , and wisely did not try to mock up the whole thing in a studio . De Wilde , best remembered for his role as ' Joey Starrett ' in ' Shane ' in 1953 , died in a road accident two years after this was made .
Terror In The Countryside	The final season of ' Out Of The Unknown ' , again produced by Alan Bromley , eschewed the science fiction for which the show was renowned , concentrating instead on supernatural tales . Bromley's reasoning was that , in the aftermath of the Apollo moon landings , science fiction was no longer thrilling . He had apparently not noticed the continuing popularity of ' Dr . Who ' and newcomer ' Doomwatch ' over on B . B . C . - 1 , also the U . S . import ' Star Trek ' ( still a comparatively new show at that time ) . ' To Lay A Ghost ' was penned by the talented Michael J . Bird , author of ' Who Pays The Ferryman ' and ' The Lotus Eaters ' . Newlyweds Eric and Diana Carver ( Iain Gregory and Lesley-Anne Down ) move into a country house . Diana was raped when she was fifteen and has never slept with her husband . While developing photographs taken of her in the grounds , Eric notices what appears to be a man in the background , even though no-one else was in shot when the picture was taken . Diana develops a strange obsession with the house , talking to it as though it were a living thing and sleepwalking in the garden at around 2 A . M . Eric gets her to pose with a crossbow , and she tries to shoot him . When a statue falls off a roof , he calls in Phillimore ( Peter Barkworth ) , a psychic investigator . They learn that the house was inhabited years earlier by a madman who raped and killed two woman . Apparently his ghost is in residence . . . A young ( and fabulously beautiful ) Lesley-Anne Down takes up the lead female role here . Three years later , she would move into Eaton Place in the I . T . V . drama ' Upstairs , Downstairs ' as rich brat ' Georgina Worsley ' . As ' Phiilimore ' we get Peter Barkworth and as ever he does not disappoint . This creepy story could never be made now because of the revelation at the end that Diana enjoyed her rape and has waited for years for the same thing to happen again . Even her husband is disgusted , and walks out . For years the fallacy existed that rape was pleasurable for a certain type of woman - Susan George's character in ' Straw Dogs ' certainly seemed to be one , while Ian Fleming in ' Casino Royale ' referred to ' the sweet tang of rape ' - but times have changed . I wish Bird had come up with a different ending . The existing one ruins an otherwise impressive episode . The double meaning in the title was apparently intentional .
The Lad Most Likely To Kill Himself !	Richard Bradford cites this as ' Suitcase ' ' worst episode . He is of course entitled to his view , but it is not one that I share , even though it is basically a retread of ' Sweet Sue ' . Rodney Bewes , fresh from the hit B . B . C . sitcom sitcom ' The Likely Lads ' ( in which he played ' Bob Ferris ' ) , plays ' Tim Gormond ' , the psychologically disturbed son of a Lord ( Bill Owen ) . He is obsessed with the Albert Bridge in Chelsea and keeps going there to try to commit suicide by jumping from it . McGill is hired by Lord Gormond to bring him home following his latest attempt . Tim tells Mac he is suffering from a guilt complex as he believes he was instrumental in the death of his best friend Danny ( Michael Culver ) . Both men had climbed to the top of the bridge as part of a childish prank , and Danny had fallen . But Mac's investigations uncover an entirely different version of events , one centred around Danny's girlfriend Annabelle Fenchurch ( Jane Merrow ) with whom Tim was secretly in love with . . . Bewes acquits himself rather well in an unfamiliar serious role . According to Bradford , the actor climbed up the bridge himself , and he felt obligated to do the same . Bradford later learnt that there was no insurance , meaning that had he suffered an injury , no pay-outs would have been made . Robert Muller , the writer , was the husband of actress Billie Whitelaw . His story gives the impression of having been a left-over from A . B . C . ' s ' The Human Jungle ' , which starred Herbert Lom as psychiatrist ' Dr . Roger Corder ' . Mac does not try to psycho-analyse Tim , he gets to the truth by questioning his friends . Annabelle's father , Sir Walter ( Anthony Nicholls ) does not want to see his daughter charged with Danny's death ( she pushed him off the bridge after he publicly dumped her ) and hires thugs to warn Mac off the case by roughing him up in a garage forecourt . One is played by Christopher Coll , best remembered for his recurring role as ' Victor Pendlebury ' ( boyfriend of Thelma Barlow's ' Mavis Riley ' ) in ' Coronation Street ' . Quite a few of the cast went on to success in shows a few years later ; Bewes starring in the Thames sitcom ' Dear Mother Love Albert ' before returning to the role of Bob Ferris in ' Whatever Happened To The Likely Lads ' , Bill Owen took on the part of ' Compo ' in the long-running ' Last Of The Summer Wine ' in 1973 , Anthony Nicholls was NEMESIS boss ' Tremayne ' in I . T . C . ' s ' The Champions ' , and Simon Williams ( who plays nightclub owner ' Lestrange ' ) was ' Captain James Bellamy ' in L . W . T . ' s hit period drama ' Upstairs , Downstairs ' in 1971 . An uncredited Robert Urquhart makes one of two ( the other was in ' Day Of Execution ' ) appearances as ' Jarvis ' , a boozy but knowledgeable Fleet Street hack , a sort of one-man Wikipedia ! Good location filming on the Albert Bridge , combined with a decent cast , make this an interesting episode , though the flashback to Danny's actual death ( " Annabelle loves Danny ! Annabelle loves Danny ! Danny does not love Annabelle ! " ) is cringe making . I reckon anyone stupid enough to talk like that from the top of a bridge deserved to drown . One last comment - was there anyone in London at that time who did not know that McGill was kicked out of American Intelligence ?
" I've been shot ! "	Les is fed up with being so skint he can only afford to eat Baked Beans ( and having to eat them cold as he cannot pay his fuel bills ) so he changes his agent . He turns up at the agency wearing ridiculously flamboyant clothes , but the only acting job he gets offered is at the Giggleswick Repertory Company . It consists of one line : " I've been shot ! " . Les complains , only to be told by the play's camp director ( Julian Orchard ) that he can either take it or leave it . Eager to make some money , Les takes it . But then the play is changed and no-one bothers to inform him . . . Slightly similar to the ' Steptoe & Son ' classic ' A Star Is Born ' , this episode sees Les ' Hancockian pretensions coming to the fore . Great supporting cast - Julian Orchard , Josephine Tewson ( am I the only living man on Earth to find her sexy ? ) , Damaris Hayman , Bernard Spear as an agent loosely based on Bernard Delfont , and Tony Sympson ( who you may remember as Reggie Perrin's ' Uncle Percy Spillinger ' ) . Les had a long way to go before approaching Hancock as a comedy actor though ; he shouts a bit too often for my liking , but that probably would have changed over time . No Roy Barrowclough alas , instead long-faced Julian Orchard provides the campery . Note Les ' line about agents : " Perhaps I should have gone with Beryl ! " - a reference to the great Beryl Vertue , showbiz agent later turned television producer . Funniest moment - Les going on stage in black make-up and wearing a grass skirt , only to find the entire cast dressed in Victorian period costume !
A Family Affair	McGill goes to Naples where millionaire Ugo ( Maurice Kaufmann ) has a job for him . His younger brother , Silvio ( Paul Bertoya ) , has inherited half a million pounds through a trust fund . All he needs to do to is sign some legal papers , and he is a rich man . Ugo wants Silvio to take the money so that he will stop sponging off him . Mac finds Silvio living amongst beatniks in London , amongst them avant-garde sculptor Tony ( Michael Sarne ) . Silvio does not want the money as he cannot stomach the social responsibility that comes with being wealthy . Sensing a kindred spirit in the young man , Mac does not force the issue . But Ciro ( John Collin ) , one of Ugo's employees , thinks differently . . . Written by Stanley R . Greenberg and Reed de Rouen ( also an actor ) , this stands out in the ' Suitcase ' canon not because of the subject matter but the way it is presented . The jokey scene-setting captions , tinkly piano interludes ( like those heard in silent movie melodramas ) , the mocking of modern youth , suggest that we are not supposed to take it seriously . One wonders if all this was laid out in the script originally , or whether the producer took one look at the rushes and felt the humorous content had to be emphasised , as later ( regrettably ) happened with ' The Avengers ' episode ' The Great Great Britain Crime ' ( which became ' Homicide & Old Lace ' ) . The sad thing is - it was unnecessary . There is quite a serious theme at the heart of this story . Mac realises he has allied himself with the wrong side in an ongoing family dispute , and despite the money on offer is not prepared to force Silvio into adopting a lifestyle he basically does not want . The closing moments show Mac himself affecting a similar getaway when his girlfriend offers him a job with her father's firm . Maurice Kaufmann , who plays ' Ugo ' , was Honor Blackman's husband . Michael Sarne , cast as Tony , had a hit in 1962 with ' Come Outside ' ( which also featured the recently deceased Wendy Richard ) , and later became a movie director . John Bluthal and Bridget Armstrong are also on view ( looking somewhat old to be playing beatniks ) . The director , Charles Frend , also made ' Scott Of The Antarctic ' starring John Mills . In a sly in-joke , a nightclub is named ' Tronsons ' in honour of Robert Tronson , one of the show's most prolific directors .
" There is no fire ! "	St . Swithin stages a fire drill , but Duncan and Dick refuse to go along with it , preferring to play cards as Bingham urges them to flee the building . To rouse them out of their apathy , Loftus appoints them ' Fire Wardens ' , a decision which infuriates Bingham as he had enjoyed the authority that went with the post . As the next drill begins , Bingham gets so carried away he starts a real fire in a waste paper basket . It spreads , and threatens the hospital . The fire brigade are sent for , but ignore the call as they have responded to numerous false alarms , mostly made by an over-enthusiastic Bingham . In desperation , Duncan and Dick steal the fire engine , and race back to St . Swithins . . . The ' fire drill which turns into a real fire ' idea is most commonly associated with the classic ' The Germans ' episode of ' Fawlty Towers ' , but here is an earlier version , minus the ' Hitler ' jokes . The late Scottish actor Duncan Lamont makes a wonderfully deadpan fire chief in ' McNab ' , reminding one at times of the legendary Rikki Fulton . Funniest moment - stuck in a traffic jam on the way to St . Swithins , Duncan tries to sound the alarm on the fire engine , but accidentally activates the hydraulic ladder !
" Pretty Polly Is Pregnant ! "	Duncan had had a one-night stand with a sexy physiotherapist some months ago whilst returning from Edinburgh . Now she is working at St . Swithins . The trouble is he did not tell her his real name , he called himself ' Dick Stuart-Clark'So now the girl - Eleanor Wilcox - addresses Duncan as ' Dick ' and vice versa , which proves confusing for the staff at St . Swithins . Duncan dare not tell her the truth as Eleanor and Kate are close friends . . . This episode has echoes of ' Honey Lamb ' from the first season of ' Doctor In Charge ' . Here the girl from Duncan's past is none other than Lynda Bellingham , sporting a blonde wig . This was years before she became famous as the mother in the ' Oxo ' adverts . It also reminded me of ' Never Give Your Real Name ' from the second season of ' Man About The House ' . Though billed as guest star , Percy Herbert gets to do surprisingly little , most of the time he leers at Eleanor . There's also a Welshman on the ward who sings all the time . The point of the character escapes me . At the end , Kate reveals that she knows about Duncan's one-night stand and is prepared to forgive him , mainly because she was having one herself at the same time with an Australian physiotherapist . Good for you , girl ! Funniest moment - Duncan and Dick are having a private chat in the canteen when Loftus sits at their table . Duncan asks shyly if he does not mind them moving so that they can continue their conversation . The Professor agrees , so Duncan and Dick move off . A few seconds later , however , Loftus picks up his dinner and follows them !
Before Bean There was Box	Every now and then something comes along which hits you in the face like a wet flannel . I caught ' Canned Laughter ' on its original I . T . V . transmission in 1979 , following a showing of ' Conquest Of The Planet Of The Apes ' . Not having heard of Mr . Atkinson , I wasn't sure what to expect . Thirty minutes later , my sides ached from laughing too much . I spent the next few days telling all and sundry about this strange rubber-faced man whom was clearly destined to be the next Peter Sellers . Atkinson played three roles ; the nerdy Robert Box , his sinister boss Mr . Marshall , and would-be stand-up comic Dave Perry . Box has somehow gotten the most attractive girl in his office , Lorraine ( played by the lovely Sue Holderness ) to agree to a date , and , being a right twit , messes it up . Box was clearly the inspiration for ' Mr . Bean ' . Despite its excellence , ' Canned Laughter ' strangely never became a series , leaving Rowan free to do ' Not The 9 O'Clock News ' for the B . B . C .
Arrivederci Roma !	Loftus wants Duncan to accompany him to a surgical conference in Rome , and entrusts him with an important document , the only one of its kind . A jealous Paul steals the paper , hiding it in a men's magazine . Duncan panics , and begins searching the hospital . Dick takes the magazine to his room , not realising it contains the paper . Loftus is so grateful to have it back he tells Dick he can go in Duncan's place . . . Remember that ' Blackadder The Third ' episode in which Robbie Coltrane played Dr . Samuel Johnson ? Well , this is an earlier version of the same idea , and even has a scene where the paper is accidentally thrown out . Shirley Stelfox , the original ' Rose ' in ' Keeping Up Appearances ' , plays Loftus ' secretary . Funniest moment - Paul doing a stand-up comedy routine in an operating theatre , resulting in Duncan telling him to leave : " There goes Dr . Doolittle ! " .
" Did you bring a rubber plant ? "	Disgusted by the poor quality food at St Swithins , Duncan and Paul both go on a macrobiotic diet , which entails them eating seaweed , millet and stuff normally found at the bottom of bird cages . Loftus invites them to dinner . They experience an evening of hell as they eat their own food whilst Loftus and his guests tuck in to succulent roast beef and crispy roast potatoes . Loftus refuses to believe the food in the hospital canteen is substandard - so he volunteers to try it himself . . . The then-trendy science of macrobiotic cooking is given a kicking here . As with the ' Mr . Moon ' episode of ' Large ' , the characters want to be healthy but learn the hard way that the lure of rich food is simply too great . Funniest moment - Duncan ordering a rump steak in the ' new , look ' canteen - and then having a fit when he is told the price .
" They call us Pinky & Perky ! "	Charles ( Charles Gray ) and Peter ( Freddie Jones ) have known each other since they were at school . After serving in the Army , they bought a house which they share . Each Friday they visit a posh bar , order the same drinks ( with nuts and crisps ) , smoke pipes , chat affably to the same people , as well as each other , mostly on the subject of the allocation of household duties . Then one evening Peter drops a bombshell - he announces he is getting married on Saturday to a woman named Joyce , and they plan on going up the Amazon together . . . Lovely gentle comedy , benefiting from two fine central performances from Freddie Jones and the late Charles Gray . The latter is probably best remembered for his role as ' Blofeld ' in the 1971 Bond film ' Diamonds Are Forever ' . Jones is , of course , one of our best living character actors . Of course Peter is not going anywhere . He invented the marriage tale simply to break what he regards as the monotony of his dull life . You wind up feeling sorry for these two - Peter for being bored out of his mind , and Charles for seeming genuinely upset at the thought of losing his oldest friend . Not much happens here but it is engaging all the same . Nicholas Courtney plays an unnamed customer whose globe-trotting lifestyle Charles and Peter look upon with envy . The actor will be familiar to ' Dr . Who ' fans as ' Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart ' . Funniest moment - Peter telling Charles : " People think we are a couple of poofs ! " . Horrified , the latter replies : " I was not a poof when I was at Dunkirk ! " . Peter says with a twinkle in his eye : " Quite a few there were ! " and goes on to relate an anecdote of an officer caught wearing ladies ' underwear when a shell blew off his uniform .
" Steam ! Steam ! "	The Gang are looking forward to a nice evening out in London . Suddenly a man steps off the pavement . Duffy's van hits him . He is Michael Upjohn , owner of a local dry cleaners . While he recuperates in hospital ( where he takes the opportunity to flirt with Maureen ) , the Gang try to make amends by running his business . Dennis and Peter struggle to make sense of the dry cleaning equipment . Frankie meanwhile reads trashy detective stories to Upjohn's mother . . . As the first series of ' The Fenn Street Gang ' drew to a close , the stories ceased to focus on individual members , and instead featured them as a group . This one is pretty good , and features the late Daphne Heard - best remembered as ' Mrs . Poo ' from ' To The Manor Born ' - as the dry cleaner's outspoken mother . Surprisingly , the only Gang member she gets on really well with is Frankie . At the end , they are walk out of a cinema showing ' The Big Sleep ' , wearing 1940's clothing and addressing each other as ' Humphrey Bogart ' and ' Lauren Bacall ' . Instead of Denis King's theme , the end titles feature an orchestral version of ' As Time Goes By ' from ' Casablanca ' . Funniest moment - Dennis accidentally putting a plate in the washing machine .
" Is anybody there ? "	Frankie recounts the time he was a private eye . A rich old battle axe named Mrs . Parsley suspects her husband of having an affair , and hires Frankie to keep tabs on him . With her in tow , he tracks her husband to a flat owned by the lovely Lola . Breaking in and hiding a walkie-talkie , Frankie is unexpectedly trapped when Mrs . Parsley takes away the ladder . A number of weird-looking people show up , so he tries to pass himself off as one of Lola's friends . Frankie thinks an orgy may be about to get underway , instead it turns out to be a séance . . . The final episode of ' The Howerd Confessions ' was penned by Dave Freeman , a former collaborator with Benny Hill , author of two ' Carry On ' pictures , and a hilarious climax to the show it makes too . Quite a few well-known faces scattered about : Sarah Douglas , who plays ' Lola ' , would go on to play the evil Kryptonian ' Ursa ' in the first two ' Superman ' movies starring Christopher Reeve , the late Margaret Courtenay was Joan Sanderson's main competition in the ' battle axe ' stakes in ' 70's sitcoms , April Olrich had appeared in the children's show ' Robert's Robots ' for Thames , while Mireille Allonville , seen as Mrs . Parsley's sexy maid ' Emmanuelle ' , was to be found fluttering around Ted Rogers and ' Dusty Bin ' in ' 3 , 2 , 1 ' in 1978 ( the poor thing ) . Funniest moment - the séance scene . Frankie has left the receive button on the walkie-talkie on , so when Mrs . Parsley tries to talk to him , the people round the table think someone from the spirit world is attempting to communicate !
Tara Steps Back In Time	Linda Thorson regards ' Pandora ' as her favourite ' Avengers ' episode , and it is not hard to see why . Visiting an antiques shop to buy a rare clock , Tara is kidnapped by the Lasindall brothers - Rupert ( Julian Glover ) and Henry ( James Cossins ) . She awakens in a beautifully furnished bedroom . People address her by the name ' Pandora ' . It appears to be sometime around the First World War . Meanwhile , Steed searches for his missing partner . The only clue is a document dropped by one of her kidnappers that makes mention of ' The Fierce Rabbit ' , a British agent who operated in France in The Great War . Steed goes to the archives and finds that it was the codename of Gregory Lasindall ( Peter Madden ) , now elderly and senile . Lasindall's crafty nephews are out to trick him into disclosing the whereabouts of his vast fortune by first making him think his beloved Pandora is still alive . Pandora is a double for Tara King . . . Brian Clemens ' script is a virtual remake of his ' Adam Adamant Lives ! ' adventure ' A Slight Case Of Reincarnation ' . Adamant himself was the one hoodwinked on that occasion , though the villains ' motives were entirely different . Julian Glover was a familiar face in ' The Avengers ' universe , having appeared in ' Three's A Crowd ' , ' The Living Dead ' , and ' Split ! ' , the latter from the same season . John Laurie was too , his previous outings include ' Brief For Murder ' and ' A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Station ' . Thorson gets one of her best roles as Tara attempts to maintain her identity despite the Lasindall's brothers ' attempts to pump her full of drugs and persuade her she really is Pandora . Robert Fuest , the director , started on ' The Avengers ' as a designer . He said years later that he loved working on the show as it freed him from what he called ' the tyranny of common sense ' , meaning it allowed him to experiment with bizarre ideas and offbeat visuals .
The Computerised Casanova !	Another great ' Avengers ' episode by Jeremy Burnham . There is a major security leak at The Ministry . Sir Rodney Kellogg , in charge of Missile Coordination , is passing secrets to . . . er , his cleaning woman . Why ? Because he loves her . He is hopelessly infatuated with Martha and will betray his country for her even though she rivals Nora Batty of ' Last Of The Summer Wine ' in the looks stakes . So what is going on ? When Tara is attacked ( yet again ! ) in her flat , a major clue is found - a ring bearing the inscription : Casanova Ink . It is the name of a publisher that specialises in romantic fiction , particularly that of Rosemary Z . Glade . Steed pops along to their offices where he meets Thelma ( Patsy Rowlands ) . Glade does not actually exist . Thelma writes the books with the help of a piano-shaped computer , programmed with every romantic fiction cliché imaginable . . . What's to say about this ? Its wonderfully daft , and has some great jokes at the expense of slushy Mills & Boon-style fiction . That suave cad Terence Alexander is the main villain , with dear Patsy Rowlands on hand , and Veronica Strong is particularly good as the chain-smoking cleaning woman able in seconds to transform herself into a picture of loveliness . Peter Stephens is seen briefly ; he was the ' Chairman of The Board Of Governors ' of St . Swithins hospital in both ' Doctor At Large ' and ' Doctor In Charge ' . The villains have impregnated the Glade books with microdots that send out subliminal messages such as : ' You Will Fall In Love With The Next Person You See ' . Tara falls for this herself at one point and Steed has to rescue her when she tries to jump out of a window . Directed by Peter Sykes , who also made the delicious Frankie Howerd comedy ' The House In Nightmare Park ' .
" That's the first rule of comedy . You've got to have reality ! "	I very nearly did not see ' Hi-De-Hi ! ' . I think it must have been the title that put me off . In those days , the Welsh language editions of ' The Radio Times ' only used to print titles of certain shows without imparting a scrap of information as to what they were actually about . ' Hi-De-Hi ! ' suggested to me a bad quiz show hosted by Leslie Crowther or worse an inane U . S . import . But I managed to catch a later episode , and was surprised to find it written by Jimmy Perry and David Croft . As was the case with ' Dad's Army ' and ' It Ain't Half Hot Mum ' , Perry based it on personal experiences , in this case his time at a Butlins ' holiday camp . Before cheap air travel came along in the ' 60's , these camps sprang up along British coastlines , providing entertainment for working class families and earning millions for their owners . ( As a matter of interest , I worked in one such camp in the ' 80's as a chef - Barry Island , South Wales - known to all and sundry as ' Shag Land ' for reasons I won't go into ! ) Set in the late ' 50's , it began with university academic Jeffrey Fairbrother ( Simon Cadell ) taking over as the entertainments manager of Maplin's , a job he was ill equipped to handle . His staff included resident comic Ted Bovis ( Paul Shane ) , his sidekick Spike ( Jeffrey Holland ) , miserable Punch and Judy man Mr . Partridge ( Leslie Dwyer ) , snobby ballroom dancers Barry ( Barry Howard ) and Yvonne Stuart-Hargreaves ) Diane Holland ) , and the unforgettable Gladys Pugh ( Ruth Madoc ) , who lusted after Fairbrother at every opportunity . Bubbly Su Pollard stole the show though as cleaner Peggy Ollerenshaw , whose driving ambition was to be a ' Yellowcoat ' ( all the important staff members wore them ) . A number of sexy girls occupied these coats too , most notably Nikki Kelly's ' Sylvia ' and statuesque Rikki Howard's ' Betty ' . We never saw Joe Maplin , the owner . He communicated to his staff in the form of ungrammatical missives , which poor Jeffrey was forced to read aloud . " Hi-De-Hi ! " was the campers ' greeting , usually met with the equally inane ' Ho-De-Ho ! . One fan was the late Sir Fred Pontin , who told Perry and Croft that he recognised most of the characters from real life . I always found Bovis the most convincing of these as well as the most tragic , like Archie Rice he was the comedian whose big break never came , reduced to cracking corny gags for the amusement of drunken late-night audiences . He took advantage of his position to indulge in a few perks , and in one memorable episode Fairbrother's patience snapped and he sounded him out : " Lies , Ted ! All lies ! " . As with every other Perry / Croft series , the cast were excellent , particularly Cadell and Shane . Ruth Madoc's prissy ' Gladys ' got on my nerves ( no wonder Anne Robinson hates the Welsh ! ) , but Leslie Dwyer's misanthropic ' Mr . Partridge ' and Felix Bowness ' jockey ' Fred Qulley ' more than compensated . The visual gag everyone remembers is drunken Mr . Partridge spotting a pantomime horse riding a real one along the beach . Looking at the bottle of whiskey in his hand , he decides to stick with it and instead throws away the banana he had been eating ! With its frothy blend of ' 50's nostalgia and saucy gags , ' Hi-De'Hi ' was a big hit for B . B . C . - 1 in the ' 80's , resulting in a massive increase in bookings for Butlins and Pontins . It went downhill when Cadell left to return to the theatre though . I never took to his replacement , Squadron Leader Clive Dempster ( David Griffin ) . Worse , Leslie Dwyer's death robbed the show of one of its best characters . Kenneth Connor was brought in to replace him as ' Uncle Sammy ' . The period setting occasionally caused problems ; in one episode , Sylvia and Betty had to dive into the pool to rescue Peggy who for some reason was dressed as a shark . The revealing costumes they wore were wrong for that era . Still they looked great in them so who's complaining ? In another , Ted sang the Tom Jones hit ' Delilah ' to campers . It was not composed ( by Les Reed and Barry Mason , incidentally ) until 1968 . Maplins closed its doors in 1988 , and the last shot was that of Peggy ( now a Yellowcoat ) all alone in the camp , jumping into the air and shouting ( what else ? ) ' Hi-De-Hi ! ' . I don't rate it as highly as Perry and Croft's other shows but its popularity is undeniable . It was probably one of the last British sitcoms to generate tremendous public affection , mainly because it featured likable characters in a recognisable setting . Goodnight campers !
" A Shining Planet Known as Earth ! "	The new ' Battlestar Galactica ' does nothing for me I'm afraid . Warning bells rang when Edward James Olmos told fans not to bother to tune in . I did but switched off in disgust during the pilot ( though I viewed it in full some time later ) when Baltar had sex with a Cylon ! Such ridiculous scenes did not endear it to me in the slightest , and succeeded only in insulting the original . ' B . S . G . ' premiered on U . S . television in 1978 , a year after ' Star Wars ' sent shock waves through the entertainment industry . As was to be expected , it repeated many of the same ingredients - dogfights in space , weird-looking aliens , exotically named planets , beautiful girls , pseudo-mysticism etc . John Dykstra , who was responsible for the S . F . X . on George Lucas ' film , was ' B . S . G . ' s original producer . The cast were mainly unknowns , such as Richard Hatch , Dirk Benedict , Maren Jensen and Laurette Spang , with Lorne Greene of ' Bonanza ' fame taking up the lead as ' Commander Adama ' . The late John Colicos made a suitably slimy villain as Count Baltar . The premise is this ; after years of conflict , the Twelve Colonies are preparing to enter into a peace settlement with their adversary , the robotic Cylons . But it turns out to be a trap ; the Cylons launch an all-out attack on Humanity and , in the ensuing conflict , the Twelve Colonies are totally wiped out . The last surviving battlestar - the Galactica - embarks on a quest to find a mythical thirteenth colony - Earth . American sci-fi shows of the ' 70's always looked good , but ' B . S . G . ' outdid them all . The action was super spectacular . Of course a lot of the dogfights were recycled , but given the pressures the production crew were under , this was to be expected . What matters is that the twenty-four episodes were , by and large , entertaining . My favourite was the two-parter ' The Living Legend ' in which the late Lloyd Bridges played long-lost war hero ' Commander Cain ' whose ' might is right ' views bring him into conflict with the more level-headed Adama . Ex-Avenger Patrick Macnee cropped up as ' Count Iblis ' in another memorable adventure - ' War Of The Gods ' . Despite its massive popularity , the network cancelled the show after one season , replacing it with the noticeably cheaper-looking ' Galactica 1980 ' . Fans gave it the thumbs-down . Here in Britain , we did not get the show until 1982 when the Welsh T . V . channel S4C screened it - and ' Galactica 1980 ' - in one continuous run . No matter how ' better ' the S . F . X . in the impostor may or may not be , only the original rests on my D . V . D . shelf .
Perfect Is Right !	Channel surfing late one night , I came across this retro show in which celebrities revealed their favourite television programmes and stated their reasons for liking them . A sort of ' Desert Island Discs ' of the airwaves . The idea's not new , of course . In the 90's , Emma Freud did a similar show on B . B . C . - 2 daytime television . But the editions featuring Lenny Henry and the combined team of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost caught my eye . Having endured numerous patronising attempts to belittle archive T . V . ( including the Pegg-narrated ' The Week We Watched ' ) , I was a bit wary at first , but it soon became apparent that ' Perfect Night In ' was not going to be another ' I Love The ' 70's ' . You know the sort of thing - after a brief clip of ' Pennies From Heaven ' , some obscure comedian shouts ' what was all that about ? ' , as though too thick to work it out for himself . Often these shows take the warped view that because a programme has dated , it no longer has any value . Precisely the attitude that led to many classic shows being wiped thirty years ago . Thankfully , ' Perfect Night In ' is the antidote to this mindless approach . I was pleased to see Pegg and Frost choosing ' Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit ' , ' The Box Of Delights ' , ' Morecambe & Wise ' , ' Animal Magic ' , ' Twin Peaks ' , ' Life On Earth ' , ' The Machinegunners ' , ' The Dick Emery Show ' and even ' The Incredible Hulk ' . Yes , they got some humour out of a few , but by and large treated them with respect . Pegg is currently one of Britain's brightest comedy stars , and has referenced numerous old shows and films in his excellent Channel 4 series ' Spaced ' , so knows his stuff . I agree with him about the original ' Dawn Of The Dead ' - its still terrifying after all these years ( and knocks spots off the remake ) . Lenny Henry chose ' Love Thy Neighbour ' - very brave of him considering its near-leper like status nowadays . He said he understood what Vince Powell and Harry Driver were trying to do , namely ridicule racism . Unfortunately , he spoilt his comment by blaming the show for the racist language used by school kids at the time . Actually , Lenny , they were using it before the first episode went out . He also praised Mel Brooks ' brilliant ' Blazing Saddles ' , despite it being chock-full of even more offensive language ! I have not seen the other shows in the series but will do so when they come round again . I wish I could get my very own edition of ' Perfect Night In ' so as to shock the nation by showing ' Curry & Chips ' and the Q6 sketch ' First Irish Rocket To The Moon ' starring Spike Milligan !
Espionage In Space	' One Way To The Moon ' is one of my favourite ' Time Tunnel ' episodes , made just before the show got bogged down with historical battles and alien invasions . Its one of only two spy stories in the series , the other being ' Secret Weapon ' , and its a pity they did not do more in similar vein . The premise is this : enemy agent Beard has infiltrated a U . S . manned flight to Mars in the year 1978 . The Russians want to stop the Americans from reaching The Red ( how ironic ) Planet first . Doug and Tony materialise aboard the rocket seconds before lift-off . Their excess weight slows it down , making the mission impossible without emergency refuelling . So they head for the Moon . The crafty Beard denounces them as spies , and recommends dumping them out of an airlock . But after going outside to repair the damaged hull , the scientists remain aboard until the ship touches down . At Project Tic-Toc in 1968 , Beard watches his future self with amazement . His fellow enemy agent Dr . Brandon blows up one of the Time Tunnel's computers , breaking visual contact with Tony and Doug . When his treachery is uncovered , he begins shooting at guards and flees . Unable to leave the complex , he hides out in the Tunnel's coils , where he is found - and later murdered - by Beard . Beard has successfully preserved his cover but is no longer able to see the fate of his future self - blown up by a bomb he planted in the fuel dump . As the rocket lifts off without them , Doug and Tony are thrown back into the infinite corridors of time . . . Stock footage from George Pal's ' Destination Moon ' provides the space and Moon scenes ( watch the rocket change shape in mid-journey ! ) . Rather oddly , the fuel dump has gravity , but lacks oxygen . As the Time Tunnel whisks the scientists off to another adventure , it divests them of their spacesuits , leaving them on the lunar surface without air . Bad science aside , this is a tense , exciting episode , neatly combining international intrigue and science fiction ( the first Moon landing was a good three years off ) . James T . Callahan is impressive in the role of the duplicitous ' Beard ' . Neither Tony nor Doug inform General Kirk of Beard's base treachery , indeed the adventure is not referred to again . Its almost a pity Beard does not get to watch his own death - the look on his face would have been priceless !
Anarchy In The U . K .	' Shades Of Greene ' was an I . T . V . anthology series based on the works of Graham Greene . The episode which most sticks in my mind was the last of the first season - ' The Destructors ' - which was adapted by the recently deceased John Mortimer and directed by Michael Apted . Set in ' 50's Britain , it tells the story of Trevor ( Nicholas Drake ) , a young grammar school boy , who is both unloved by his parents and friendless . His main hobby is British military history . Trevor is keen to be ' a big fish in a small pond ' and so he becomes a member of a gang of ruffians ( among them a pre-'Quadrophenia ' Phil Daniels ) . He does not fit in with them initially . They laugh at his posh-sounding name , necessitating a change to the harder sounding ' Big T ' . Trevor comes up with a plan - namely to break into the home of an old age pensioner when he is away on holiday and trash the place . This they do . Cups are broken , books torn up , pictures smashed , even the old man's war medals are callously stamped on . Everything the man ever owned is destroyed . Throughout the carnage , Trevor is in full command , spurring his ' army ' on to ever greater acts of vandalism . When the old man returns , he is understandably horrified , but as there were no witnesses no-one is formally charged . Trevor returns to school . The gang follows him there and yell at him through the railings , demanding more leadership , but he completely ignores them . His moment of glory is over . There were protests galore when this was first screened . Many felt it was an incitement to youngsters to commit copy-cat crimes . It did not happen though as ' Shades Of Greene ' had little appeal for the young . I recall being shocked at the trashing of the old man's home - it had a savagery that I had never seen on television before . These boys were determined to destroy everything he valued , and did so . And no-one got caught or punished for it . The political subtext was plain for all to see . By wrecking the old man's house , Trevor and his gang were in effect conducting their own ' revolution ' against the establishment . However one wished to interpret it , ' The Destructors ' was a disturbing and memorable piece of television .
Man Or Monster ?	Charles and Margaret Wilson have a teenage son they refer to only as ' Boy ' . He is a mutant , the next stage in human evolution . Outwardly he is perfectly normal , except for a curious lack of fingernails . He is blessed ( cursed ? ) with strange psychic powers - he can make people do what he wants just by thinking about it . ' Boy ' is being hunted by those wishing to study him . The Wilsons are constantly moving from one place to another , they can never settle down anywhere for long because the authorities are on their trail . He meets and is attracted to Paula Wilde , a struggling American actress . She introduces him to her greedy agent Sonny , who sees ' Boy ' as a meal ticket . . . This intriguing David Campton story was not new to television viewers ; the B . B . C . ' s highly regarded ' Out Of The Unknown ' did an adaptation in 1965 starring Richard O'Callaghan as ' Boy ' with Justine Lord as ' Paula ' . Not having seen that earlier version , I cannot make comparisons . Like the Marvel Comic ' The X-Men ' , ' Stranger ' touches on the theme of mutants - people who look like us but who are different - and how they are regarded with fear and mistrust by an uncomprehending Mankind . Anthony Corlan ( later to change his surname to ' Higgins ' ) gives a moody , compelling performance as the tormented ' Boy ' . He later appeared in Hammer's ' Vampire Circus ' . American actress Janice Rule ( a talented lady who sadly never got the roles she deserved ) is excellent as the object of his affections . Also in the cast are Glynn Edwards ( ' Dave ' the barman from ' Minder ' ) and Gerald Sim ( the vicar in ' To The Manor Born ' ) . Directed by Peter Duffell , whose other television credits include ' Strange Report ' and ' Man In A Suitcase ' .
I'm Dreaming Of A Blue ( Peter ) Christmas	This was a lame excuse to run the bits that didn't get into ' I Love The ' 70's ' the previous summer . Again the Z-listers were trotted out to tell us what they once got for Christmas , or rather what they would have got had they been alive then . The main attraction for us forty-somethings was seeing John Noakes , Peter Purves and Valerie Singleton again , acting as though they'd never been away from ' Blue Peter ' . As a matter of fact , the Titanic Three enjoyed the reunion so much they wanted to do a nostalgia series , but the mean old B . B . C . wouldn't let them . I suppose its asking too much for a nostalgia show to actually exhibit affection for the past , as young people - who these shows are mostly aimed at - are so full of spite and hatred they won't watch anything about the ' 70's unless its done with a sneer . It wasn't until Channel 5's 2006 series ' The 70's : The Decade That Was ' that an honest depiction of the era was finally presented . About time too . Only an idiot would dismiss an entire decade as rubbish .
" My Dad Won't Let Me Work At The Brewery ! "	With 5C's time at Fenn St . School drawing to a close , the pupils have to start thinking about work . To everyone's amazement , Frankie lands a job in a private detective agency - but as a tea-boy . It does not stop him from fantasising about being Humphrey Bogart , however . After failing to secure a job , Dennis is demoralised , so Mr . Hedges decides to help him . Noticing that he is good with animals , the kindly teacher suggests he work as stable boy at a local brewery . The owner agrees to give him a three-month trial . Dennis is elated - but there's a fly in the ointment . Dennis ' father is dead against the idea , on account of the fact that one of the brewery's pubs refused him credit . Angered , Mr . Hedges prepares for a showdown with the drunken , violent David Dunstable . . . The seeds of ' The Fenn Street Gang ' were sown with this episode . It does seem odd that two seemingly unemployable pupils should get jobs so quickly ! Mr . Dunstable's unreasonable behaviour upsets not just Hedges , but everyone in the school . Duffy is ready to beat seven bells out of him , while both Mr . Price and Miss Ewell call him a ' bastard ' ( an uncommon word in a prime-time sitcom in those days ) . Hedges ' rage boils over and , for a moment , it looks as though the mild-mannered teacher is going to turn violent . Ultimately though , its Dennis who breaks his drunkard father's nose , bringing about a reluctant change of heart . Its a unusually powerful scene . Fine acting from John Alderton , Peter Bayliss and Peter Denyer here . Funniest moment - Abbott turning up for school as ' Hank Abbott - Private Eye ' !
" C'mon , We're Putting On The Nonsense . . . "	In the pre-'Tiswas ' early ' 70's , I . T . V . filled up Saturday mornings with repeats of ' Captain Scarlet & The Mysterons ' , as well as American imports like ' H . R . Pufnstuf ' ( starring the late Jack Wild ) , ' Elephant Boy ' , and , of course , ' Tomfoolery ' ( though it was actually made in Britain ) . To give it its full title , ' The Tomfoolery Show ' was a Rankin-Bass ( also responsible for ' Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer ' and ' Frosty The Snowman ' ) animated sketch show based on poems by Edward Lear and Lewis Carroll , such as ' The Owl & The Pussycat ' and ' The Courtship of The Yonghy Bonghy Bo ' . ' Yonghy ' , incidentally the only vaguely normal looking character in the show , shared billing with ' The Scroobious Snake ' ( who wore a straw hat and bow tie ) , ' The Enthusiastic Elephant ' ( who talked like W . C . Fields ) , ' Fastidious Fish ' ( who lived in a goldfish bowl and moved around on stilts ) , ' The Umbrageous Umbrella Maker ' ( whose face was permanently obscured by a brolly ) , and a hyperactive bird who kept flapping about and going ' Don't worry ! Don't worry ! ' . These ludicrous characters were like something out of a nightmare and yet were indisputably funny . Much of the humour raided classic comedy films such as ' Hellzapoppin ' and those of Abbott & Costello ( their famous ' Fliegel Street ' skit was recreated by the Enthusiastic Elephant ) . Amongst the regular items was ' Brainy Lecture ' , where quite useless facts would be presented in a deadly serious manner . Typical ' Tomfoolery ' moment : a General is giving his troops a final briefing before the commencement of battle . GENERAL ( in a low voice ) : We attack the Grimbo-Grumbo at dawn . SOLDIER ( also in a low voice ) ; Sir , where are the Grimbo-Grumbo ? GENERAL ( still in a low voice ) : One hundred miles away . SOLDIER ( raising his voice to a near-shout ) : One hundred miles away ? Then why are we whispering ? GENERAL ( in an even lower voice ) : Sorry . I've got a sore throat . If Spike Milligan's ' Q ' series had been a cartoon , it would have looked very much like ' Tomfoolery ' . The anarchic humour , the revelling in silliness for its own sake , the daft sound effects , all had a Milliganeque feel . Spike's own ' The Ning Nang Nong ' would have fitted perfectly into the show . The songs were great too ; one went like this : ' Bibbedy-bobbedy , that makes good sense , good old nonsense . Bibbedy-bobbedy , ladies and gents , pennies are pence to me . " ( you had to be there , folks ) . Voices were provided by Peter Hawkins ( who also did ' Captain Pugwash ' and ' the Daleks ' ) and Bernard Spear . Needless to say , this was a show I loved , more so than ' The Banana Splits ' which was on the B . B . C . at the same time . Surprisingly , it is still not available on D . V . D . , though clips are to be found on ' You Tube ' . Great nostalgia !
Upton In Living Colour !	London Television wants to come to St . Swithins to record an item for a current affairs programme about the state of the N . H . S . Loftus asks Dick and Mike to appear with him . Both are naturally thrilled . But the other students are unhappy about being left out and try to disrupt the proceedings , firstly by painting a clown's white face on Upton prior to taping , then Hooley masquerades as an 82 year old patient named Mrs . Crabtree in order to be interviewed . His performance ends abruptly when Upton tries to give him an enema . Dick has a disagreement with Loftus over a diagnosis which the cameras manage to capture . Things come to a head in the students ' bar when the crew catches them at their drunken worst . . . Its one of the oldest sitcom plots in the book . A film / T . V . crew turns up so people start showing off , but the broadcast item is not what was expected . A similar idea was later done in I . T . V . ' s other great medical sitcom - ' Only When I Laugh ' . But it works well enough here . The big twist is that the footage is for a damning indictment about the N . H . S . , and Loftus is naturally furious . Things To Look Out For : Graeme Garden , co-writer of this and many other ' Doctor ' episodes , appears briefly as a T . V . presenter . Another Thing To Look Out For : Dick mentions Dirk Bogarde , the star of the ' Doctor ' movies . Spot The Mistake : Jonathan Lynn slipping on spilt beer in the students ' bar . To everyone's credit , the scene continues as planned . Funniest moment - Hooley's impersonation of ' Mrs . Crabtree ' . His head wrapped in a shawl , and without make-up , Lynn is totally convincing as an old Irish woman .
" Skate and I are going kating ! "	Duncan is suffering from depression and does not know why , so he goes to see psychiatrist Professor Browning , who advises him to change his lifestyle , to become more ' with it ' . He does so , and his friends are amazed at the change . MacKenzie and Stuart-Clark are so impressed they go to see the Professor themselves , resulting in major personality shifts . Andy loses his love of alcohol , while Dick not only stops drinking , gambling and womanizing , but develops a serious interest in medicine . Even Loftus is not immune from the professor's way of thinking . . . Very good episode , this , notable for the sight of the regulars acting out of character . Only Kate is unaffected . Stuart-Clark's studious new image is a foretaste of the persona he'd eventually adopt in ' Doctor At The Top ' . Funniest moment - Loftus showing up at Kate's dinner party in loud clothes , and acting in a unnaturally jocular manner : " Call me Geoffrey ! " .
" Mrs . Peel , We're Needed ! "	' The Avengers ' is one of the most successful television shows ever made in Britain , and stands up extremely well forty years later . It starred Ian Hendry originally as ' Dr . David Keel ' , a medic turned investigator after his fiancée is killed by the underworld . His partner ' John Steed ' was played by Patrick Macnee . Initially , Steed was a trenchcoat-wearing spook no different from a thousand others , but as the series progressed he evolved into the suave , bowler-hatted , umbrella-carrying secret agent we all know and love , the quintessential gentleman spy . When Hendry dropped out , they replaced him with Honor Blackman as the karate-chopping ' Mrs . Cathy Gale ' . The show took off . Honor left after two seasons to co-star in the Bond classic ' Goldfinger ' . After a false start with Elisabeth Shepherd , the producers sensibly cast Diana Rigg as ' Mrs . Emma Peel ' . Of all the actresses to have played his sexy sidekicks , she was the one who made the greatest impact . Her arrival coincided with a move onto film , and the plots got wilder ! The pair would be called on to solve the most outrageous crimes imaginable , bringing them into contact with fiendishly clever diabolical masterminds . The new-look ' Avengers ' was a smash hit in the U . S . A . precisely because it made no attempt to pander to American tastes . From the very moment the classy opening titles and marvellous Laurie Johnson theme tune burst onto the screen , it has a polish that positively dazzles . Where else would you get to see Ronnie Barker training cats to become assassins , a fight where the protagonists wear anti-gravity boots , bird seed spilling out of a dead man's chest , Clive Dunn killed by a ' Jack-In-The-Box ' , Paul Eddington regressing to childhood after touching a bouncy ball , John Cleese as a collector of eggs bearing the faces of clowns , a computer that writes romantic fiction , invisible spies , Venusian death-rays , rain-making machines , man-eating plants from space , amnesia-inducing milk , guns that destroy nothing except wood , British Rail ticket collectors out to take over the country , miniaturisation machines , underground cities , a village where for a price you can commit murder and the locals provide you with an alibi , and an assassination bureau masquerading as a dating agency . Nowhere except ' The Avengers ' . If you've never seen an episode , give it a whirl . You'll like it . Rigg left in 1967 and the unknown Linda Thorson took her place as ' Tara King ' . The Thorson series is in my view the highpoint of the show . But in America it was badly scheduled and ended after 32 episodes . ' The Avengers ' returned in 1976 as ' The New Avengers ' , teaming Steed with Gareth Hunt's ' Mike Gambit ' and ' Joanna Lumley's ' Purdey ' . Two seasons were made . The Rigg shows were repeated by Channel 4 in 1982 at the ungodly time of 12 . 55 a . m . on Sundays . However , it proved so popular it was eventually promoted to peak-time Sunday evening . Recent repeats have taken place on Sky's now-defunct Granada Plus , and B . B . C . - 4 . In 1998 , ' The Avengers ' was made into a movie starring Ralph Fiennes , Uma Thurman , and Sean Connery . Though not well received at the time , it has developed something of a cult following . A campaign is presently underway to secure a Director's Cut D . V . D . release . I loved ' The Avengers ' as a boy , and love it still . It gets better the further away from the ' 60's we get .
" Hullo and welcome to Dirty Dick's "	I have a vague memory of watching a very funny show on New Year's Eve sometime in the early Eighties , starring the late , great Rikki Fulton . As I was in the grip of alcohol at the time , its title did not register in my memory , but I knew it to be good . Ever since then I've wanted to know , and see more about this whimsical show . I'm greatly indebted to my friend Powrman for recommending ' Scotch & Wry ' . This long-running sketch show from B . B . C . Scotland was never networked ( apart from the 1982 Special ) . Presumably the suits thought it too parochial , but if so they were wrong . Having recently watched a number of shows on D . V . D . , I can say with absolute confidence its one of the funniest shows I've ever seen . The sketches were fairly long - some running as long as seven minutes - but this was an asset rather than a drawback as it gave the cast - Fulton in particular - a chance to flesh out their characters . His long-faced vicar - The Rev . I . M . Jolly ( " Ah've had a helluva year ! " ) - was so popular he went on to front a number of specials . Also in the cast for a long time was Gregor Fisher , later to go on to ' Naked Video ' where he stole the show as ' Rab C . Nesbitt ' , and Tony Roper , who played ' Jamesie Cotter ' . The quality of the sketches is extremely good ; John Byrne of ' Tutti Frutti ' fame being a contributor . As is the norm with sketch shows , various stock characters evolved ; as well as the Rev . I . M . Jolly , there was also the inappropriately named ' Supercop ' , slovenly television chef ' Dickie Dandruff ' , and wide boy McGlinchey . But Fulton's ' Last Calls ' made the show special . Those of us who remember when television stations used to close down at midnight with the ' Epilogue ' recognise only too well what is being parodied here . One of the best sketches had Fulton - as a different priest - getting progressively drunker whilst on air . Fulton is best remembered in the rest of the U . K . for his roles in straight dramas such as ' Charlie Endell Esquire ' ( in which he played a vicious gangster who had the wonderful line : " Porno magazines don't run ' Spot The Ball ' contests ! " ) and ' Bergerac ' . ' Scotch & Wry ' shows us he was capable of so much more . I haven't watched all the episodes . I'm saving a few for New Year's Eve ! No wonder this programme - and Fulton - is so greatly revered in Scotland .
Alf Garnett - This Is Your Life !	No sooner had the television version of Johnny Speight's controversial B . B . C . sitcom ended - temporarily , as it turned out - than the cast reunited for this feature film spin-off . Interestingly , it sets itself up as a prequel , initially featuring Alf and Else in London's East End during the Forties . We see Alf here as an eccentric patriot , rather than the tyrant bigot he became . Over news reel footage of Nazi tanks he boasts that Hitler is too scared to go to war with Britain . But it happens , and suddenly he is terrified . He believes it won't last long though . His patriotism vanishes the day the call-up papers land on his doormat . The attention to period detail here is marvellous ; rationing books , air-raid shelters , doom-filled radio broadcasts , they're all here . Much to his disgust , soldiers are tucking into bacon and eggs while he has to make do with spam . The pub runs out of beer , and Alf cannot fill his pipe with tobacco . Though he manages to stay out of the army by being in a reserved occupation , he has other problems to contend with - Else is pregnant . The second part takes us to 1966 ; mini-skirts are in fashion , and Alf comes into conflict with his trendy lefty daughter Rita and her ' Scouse git ' boyfriend Mike Rawlins . Alf won't let her put ' Vote Labour ' posters in his window . This section is not as good as the first , but it is nice to see the circumstances that brought the characters together . There is a hilarious scene at Rita's wedding reception when Alf gets into a fight with Mike's father , a devout Catholic . Amongst the cast is future ' On The Buses ' stars Michael Robbins and Bob Grant ( even though the latter has no lines ) . Norman Cohen must have liked working in the wartime period as he went on to direct the film version of ' Dad's Army ' and ' Adolf Hitler My Part In His Downfall ' , based on Spike Milligan's memoirs . Bill Maynard plays ' Bert ' , Alf's next door neighbour , with whom he conducts conversations whilst on the toilet ( how well I remember outside bogs . Ugh ! Cold ! ) . It is impossible not to feel sorry for Alf as he walks up the street where he has lived for years , now deserted . For many people , this was a reality . Hitler could not destroy the street , but the local council did . The movie ends where it began - in a cinema - with Alf standing as the National Anthem plays , everyone else having gone home . Released in America under the title ' Alf ' n Family ' ( presumably to capitalise on the connection with ' All In The Family ' ) , it was so successful it opened the floodgates for other sitcom-based films such as ' On The Buses ' and ' Dad's Army ' . A sequel - ' The Alf Garnett Saga ' - was made three years later , but it was not a patch on the first .
Sellers Behind Bars !	Peter Sellers in the innocent days before Hollywood got hold of him . ' Two Way Stretch ' is a bright and breezy British comedy typical of the period . He plays ' Dodger Lane ' , a Cockney crook imprisoned at H . M . P . Huntleigh , along with safe cracker ' Jelly ' Knight ( David Lodge ) and pickpocket ' Lennie The Dip ' Price ( Bernard Cribbins ) . To say they are having a cushy time would be an understatement . A milkman delivers Gold Top each morning , along with food and newspapers , and their cell is , according to C . P . O . Jenkins ( George Woodbridge ) ' the best place in the nick to get a cup of tea ' . They even have a cat , appropriately named ' Strangeways ' . As the film opens , Dodger is recovering from a surfeit of sherry trifle . The lads are due for release in a few days ' time . Then fellow crook Soapy Stevens ( Wilfrid Hyde-White ) turns up , posing as a vicar . He escaped imprisonment after their last job because he was the only one with a water-tight alibi . Stevens has learnt that a Sultan's diamonds to be conveyed through the area under army escort . Stevens wants Dodger and the lads to steal the consignment . Knowing that this time , they are the ones with the perfect alibi , they readily agree . There are just two minor problems - firstly , they need to break out of the nick , and secondly , Jenkins ' replacement is none other than C . P . O . Sidney Crout ( Lionel Jeffries ) , a hard-faced warder who regards all convicts as scum . . . John Warren ( who wrote a lot of Dick Emery's shows ) and Len Heath's script is full of wonderful comic ideas and lines , and directed with a sure touch by Robert Day . One has to wonder whether or not the B . B . C . sitcom ' Porridge ' derived any inspiration from this , so closely does the latter resemble the former ( curiously , 1965's ' Rotten To The Core ' starring Anton Rodgers also features crooks named ' Jelly ' Knight and ' Lennie The Dip ' , though played by Kenneth Griffith and Dudley Sutton . Coincidence ? Or was ' Core ' originally planned as a sequel to ' Stretch ? ' ) . Alongside the main cast are old favourites Liz Fraser , Irene Handl ( delightful as Lenny's toothless mum ) , Warren Mitchell , Thorley Walters ( as a dimwitted army officer ) , Mario Fabrizi , Maurice Denham , Beryl Reid , and Arthur Mullard . The latter gets one of the best lines . Visited by his wife and her baby , he asks how old it is . " Eight months ! " comes the reply . Arthur looks chuffed at first , and then baffled : " But I've been inside for two years ! " . As was the case with most of the films he appeared in , Lionel Jeffries effortlessly steals the film . He is able to make you laugh by simply bellowing " On the double ! " and that takes some doing . My only complaint is that the film does not really ( pardon the pun ) stretch Sellers as an actor . He is good as the lovable ' Dodger ' , but the role could have been played by anybody . One wonders whether Sid James could have done just as good a job . If ' Two Way Stretch ' is not a part of your collection of classic British comedy films , you should put that right immediately . Funniest moment ? Its got to be the scene in the yard where Crout is trying to exercise the convicts by making them jump up and down on the spot . He does not know that beneath him is part of a tunnel dug by Lennie and Jelly . He soon finds out - by falling into it ! Happy New Year to you all , by the way .
We Are Not Alone !	Along with ' Star Wars ' , ' Close Encounters Of The Third Kind ' broke with the tradition of ' 70's science fiction movies . ' Soylent Green ' , ' No Blade Of Grass ' , ' A Clockwork Orange ' , ' Zardoz ' , ' Rollerball ' , ' The Final Programme ' - good though they were - were bleak and depressing in that they predicted a grim future for Mankind , as did ' Logan's Run ' and the ' Planet Of The Apes ' sequels . Woody Allen's ' Sleeper ' , though a comedy , followed more or less the same pattern . ' C . E . ' was Steven Spielberg's first film since ' Jaws ' , then the biggest grossing movie of all time . How to top it ? With ' 2001 : A Space Odyssey ' still regarded as the pinnacle of science fiction cinema , he decided to marry that film's intelligence to a more human story . The main character , Roy Neary ( Richard Dreyfuss ) sees a U . F . O . on a country road at night , and becomes obsessed to the point where his family think he has gone mad and eventually abandon him , and he seems not to care . The Neary stuff is interspersed with the exploits of a team of investigators , headed by ' Lacombe ' ( Francois Trauffaut ) . Neary teams up with fellow U . F . O . watcher Jillian , and they cut through the web of secrecy put in place by the U . S . Government over the sightings . The film ends in spectacular fashion ( all the more remarkable seeing that C . G . I . was two decades away ) with the landing of the Mother Ship at a secret base in Wyoming . Great visual effects from Douglas Trumbull ( who had worked on ' 2001 ' ) . Ditto John Williams ' evocative music . Dreyfuss is excellent as the everyman figure ' Neary ' , as is Teri Garr as his wife . The U . F . O . watchers are not nerdy , bespectacled types , but drawn from all walks of life . The ' cover-up ' stuff probably registered with the original U . S . audience ( this was four years after Watergate ) . I was at school when news of this film broke . ' Starburst ' magazine ran a somewhat portentious review by Ray Bradbury in which he virtually canonised Spielberg . ' C . E . ' did not open here until 1978 , meaning that speculation in the run-up to its British release was rife . What did that title actually mean ? Were the aliens friendly or hostile ? Would ' Jaws ' make a cameo ? Sci-fi fans split into two groups ; if you admitted to liking ' Star Wars ' , you were regarded as a moron , but if you said you appreciated ' C . E . ' , you were a towering genius . I always said that I preferred ' C . E . ' ( without mentioning the ' Star Wars ' novelisation tucked away in my satchel ) . That fan followings had developed for a couple of movies no-one had actually seen in the U . K . was fairly bizarre . Then , months later , the films opened here . Unfortunately , my local theatre chose to play them on the same week , meaning I had to decide which one to go and see first . I plumped for ' Star Wars ' . Funnily enough , who should I bump into in the queue but all those ' C . E . ' fans who dismissed George Lucas ' movie as rubbish . I saw ' C . E . ' on its final day , and was blown away . It was funny , thrilling , scary , and beautiful . I have watched it on television many times since and , believe me , the goggle box does not do it justice . The scene where Barry runs out of his house at night , for instance , is followed by a shot of a worried Jillian looking out of a window and calling his name . Over the house you can see a dot of white light moving up the night sky . It drew gasps of terror in the cinema . On television it is barely noticeable . If you get the chance to see ' C . E . ' on the big screen , do so . In an era where sci-fi movies warned of the terrible dangers facing Mankind , ' C . E . ' , with its positive message , came as a breath of fresh air . It remains a true cinematic landmark .
Frank & Betty's Second Honeymoon	A well-remembered episode of the first season of ' Some Mothers Do Ave Em ' . Frank and Betty are on their second honeymoon ( what must have the first have been like ? ) . After narrowly catching the train , Frank takes his poor spouse to a drab looking guest house , run by Mr . Bedford ( Neil McCarthy ) who seems about as friendly as a wet weekend in Saundersfoot , South Wales . The only other guest is nervous ( and slightly camp ) Kenny ( Cyril Shaps ) . Finding two single beds in their room , Frank pushes them together - and tears a big hole in the lino . To conceal this , he takes a rug from under a wardrobe , tearing it cleanly in half . The wardrobe is now lopsided , so Frank needs something to go under it . Betty looks on in horror as her husband gradually demolishes the room . Finding his wardrobe gone and his clothes laid out on the bed , Kenny thinks the hotel is haunted . . . Hilarious from start to finish , this episode has two very good guest performances from Neil McCarthy and Cyril Shaps . McCarthy's ' Bedford ' is Basil Fawltyesque at times ( he has a moustache too ! ) , especially when he tells Kenny : " we don't have funny furniture here . . . only funny people ! " . As ' Kenny ' , Shaps is a scream , whining Bedford's name every time something strange happens . He put me in mind of the sheep from the old Hanna Barbara cartoon ' Its The Wolf ! ' . Crawford and Dotrice are great too ( why does Betty never walk out on this guy ? I know that love is supposed to be blind , but . . . ) . Each time Frank damages something , he says : " I'll throw that out in the morning ! " . It ends with the pair doing a moonlight flit ( luckily , Frank did not leave behind a home address ) through a hole in the floor of their room . Funniest moment - Kenny espying his wardrobe on the move !
" Excellent ! "	I've never understood the school of thought which says all prime time comedy is ' bland ' whilst anything post-watershed is ' dark ' and ' original ' . ' The Brittas Empire ' was enjoyed by a family audience , yet also managed to be ' dark ' ; people got shot , electrocuted , decapitated etc . Chris Barrie played ' Gordon Brittas ' , manager of a leisure centre , a man whose incompetence is matched only by his delusions of grandeur . His put-upon staff include the odious handyman Colin and emotionally overwrought receptionist Carole . Brittas ' wife Helen is neurotic and who can blame her for being so ? Richard Fegen and Andrew Noriss have not received nearly enough credit for their cleverly constructed scripts , which carefully balanced ' slapstick ' with ' black comedy ' . They had the sense to include normal characters such as Laura . Comedy shows peopled entirely by loonies get tiresome very quickly . Not regarded as one of the comedy classics of the ' 90's , but funnier than many of the ones that are .
" Simple , obvious psychosis . "	Their escape attempts having failed , the Colditz P . O . W . ' s plan to dig a tunnel , but Wing Commander George Marsh ( Michael Bryant ) has another idea - repatriation . If he can convince the Germans he has become schizophrenic , he will be sent home . Luckily , Marsh used to work in a mental hospital and knows exactly what sort of behaviour is required of him . Colonel Preston warns him of the dangers involved , but he goes ahead regardless . With only a handful of P . O . W . ' s in on Marsh's plan , they watch with bafflement as he effects a brilliant impersonation of a man whose mental health is in serious decline . He plays the same gramophone record over and over again , walks out of the castle when the doors are opened to admit a new arrival , talks to himself , plays with a toy plane and even urinates in public . He becomes a figure of fun , earning himself the unflattering nickname ' Tweedledum ' . But how far is Marsh prepared to go in order to win his freedom ? Written by John Brason , ' Tweedledum ' is a superb piece of drama which could easily have served as a one-off play . The regulars are around , but its Michael Bryant's tour-de-force performance as the seemingly deranged ' Marsh ' which takes centre stage . He is simply magnificent . Comedy actor Geoffrey Palmer plays ' Doc ' , one of the few prisoners to know what Marsh is up to . One scene was inspired by a famous moment in ' The Colditz Story ' film . As the P . O . W . ' s exercise in the grounds , one man executes a daring acrobatic leap over the fence and runs for his life . One of the great things about this series was that the Germans were not portrayed as the heel-clicking ' we are the masters now ' stereotypes so beloved of countless war movies . Bernard Hepton's Kommandant , for example , is a man doing a job , not a sadist . One of the major characters in this story is a sympathetic German , played by Berrnard Kay . I don't normally cry easily but I defy anyone not to be moved at the end as Marsh is finally led to the car that will take him away from the castle . His freedom has been earned at a terrible cost . When in 1986 the B . B . C . screened a retrospective of archive programmes , this was the episode of ' Colditz ' they selected .
" You dirty old man ! You prodded my bosom ! "	The first episode of the classic I . T . V . sitcom ' Man About The House ' . Chrissy and Jo are a pair of attractive young working class women living a bed-sit in Myddleton Terrace , London . Their third flatmate , Eleanor , recently left to get married ( and have a baby ! ) , which means there is now a vacancy for her room . A wild party takes place in the flat , and the next morning Chrissy and Jo are faced with the mammoth task of clearing away empty bottles , used cigarette packets , and half-eaten food . Preparing to take a bath , Jo finds it occupied - by Robin Tripp , a cookery student of no fixed abode . While his clothes dry out , the girls give him a woman's dressing gown to wear . He cooks them a scrumptious meal based on the few ingredients they have in their fridge . They like it so much they ask him to stay . With no place of his own ( and keen on the idea of living with two sexy , single girls ) he accepts . But how to explain his presence to their landlord , Mr . Roper ? Johnnie Mortimer and Brian Cooke followed up their successful ' Father Dear Father ' with this equally popular show . They had worked with Richard O'Sullivan on ' F . D . F . ' - he played ' Howard ' , the accident-prone boyfriend of one of Patrick Cargill's daughters . The actor was also then appearing in ' Doctor In Charge ' , as the conceited ' Dr . Lawrence Bingham ' . ' Robin Tripp ' was very different to ' Bingham ' , being trendy , lecherous and in possession of a sense of humour . Knowing the subject matter was likely to give Mrs . Mary Whitehouse a fit of the vapours , the writers made it clear that there was no hanky-panky in Myddleton Terrace . Robin might have wanted it , but the girls were not forthcoming . This game of ' will they won't they ' was played for six seasons from 1973-76 and it is to everyone's credit that it never once became boring . Brian Murphy and Yootha Joyce stole the show as the warring Ropers , and later landed their own spin-off . Helen Fraser , a . k . a . ' Dr . Mary Bingham ' from ' Doctor In Charge ' , appears here as the horsey ' Gabrielle ' ( " my friends call me Gabby ! " ) , who has responded to the girls ' ad in the paper for a new flatmate . Funniest moment - thinking ' Gabby ' is a man in drag ( based on what Mildred earlier told him ) , Roper pokes her ample breast with his finger , only to find it is not fake !
The Private Eye Who Became A Private Ear	' Shoestring ' is , in my view , the finest detective series the B . B . C . has ever made . The same production team were responsible for the later ( and vastly inferior ) ' Bergerac ' , but it had something the Jersey-based show lacked - Trevor Eve . In his pyjama jacket , Beatles-styled mop ( Eve had once played Paul McCartney on stage ) and sporting a fashionable moustache , the character could easily have crossed the line into parody ( he also had a habit of sketching the people he met in the course of cases ) , but Eve made Eddie warm and believable . Shoestring was originally a computer programmer who'd lost his job as the result of a nervous breakdown . His landlady , Erica Bayliss , worked in the police archives , and was a big help to him as she had access to confidential files . After a case involving a dead prostitute , Eddie was offered his own show by Radio West . Nowhere was Eve's acting ability more impressive than the scene in the second episode where Eddie suffers a fit of nerves whilst on air for the first time . Admittedly , his cases were small beer by comparison with U . S . detectives such as ' Philip Marlowe ' - religious cults , fake antiques dealers , punk rockers and dangerous Christmas toys - but the scripts were good and the cast performed them excellently . Special mention must go to George Fenton for his wonderful music , and Sid Sutton for his titles . ' Shoestring ' was a big hit ( Cary Grant was reputedly a fan ) , even though its second season clashed with ' The Professionals ' on I . T . V . , and should have run for five years at least . But it was not to be . Fearing typecasting , Trevor Eve quit after two . Due to complicated music rights issues , we are unlikely to see ' Shoestring ' on D . V . D . for the foreseeable future . A great shame .
" Dear B . B . C . . . "	Often the simplest ideas for programmes are best , and ' Points Of View ' typifies this . Beginning in 1961 , it basically consisted of a ten minute show in which viewers ' letters were read out by actors ( such as Alec Bregonzi , Cass Allen , and Michael Maclaine ) , interspersed with witty comments from a presenter . When I saw it first , the front man was urbane Robert Robinson . He also appeared in the kids ' spin-off : ' Junior Points Of View ' , which was essential viewing if you were a ' Dr . Who ' fan , as many letters concerned the show . On the day before his first appearance as the Time Lord , Jon Pertwee gave an interview in which he specified how different his version would be from Patrick Troughton's . No actual clips were shown , of course . The B . B . C . were not fools in those days . Some of the letters were genuinely amusing . I remember complaints about Captain Kirk kissing girls each week on ' Star Trek ' , Dick Dastardly's repeated use of " Drat , Drat and Double Drat ! " on ' Wacky Races ' , and the Clangers ' penny-whistle voices . Over on the parent show , the sci-fi drama ' Doomwatch ' could be relied on to kick up a storm , particularly the ' Tomorrow , The Rat ' episode which climaxed with a graphic shot of a half-eaten corpse . ' Steptoe & Son ' returned that same year . You would think that viewers would be overjoyed , but a few grumbled that the sight of Harold distraught over the death of Hercules the horse was not funny . ' Till Death Us Do Part ' got into hot water with the ' Up The Hammers ! ' episode from 1972 . The scene where Rita ( Una Stubbs ) leaves a supermarket only to find baby Michael gone ( Alf had taken him to a football match ) was too harrowing for some . Such grievances can today be regarded with quizzical amusement , but at the time were genuine concerns . A lot of people felt , rightly or wrongly , that some things were unsuitable for television . A few comedy shows took the mickey out of ' View ' , such as ' Monty Python's Flying Circus ' and ' Spitting Image ' , but probably the best-remembered parody was on ' Not The Nine O'Clock News ' . By then , Barry Took had taken over , and was wonderfully impersonated by Griff Rhys Jones . " Fifty pounds for a television licence ! " , went one spoof letter . " Absolutely disgraceful ! Its far too low . I would be willing to sell my house to help the B . B . C . " . Took was an excellent presenter , witty and likable . When the Kate O'Mara nautical soap ' Triangle ' went on air , it provoked so much controversy an entire edition of ' View ' was given over to comments . The funniest suggested the ship on which the show was set should hit an iceberg Titanic-style , and then it could be renamed ' Wreck-tangle ' ( rectangle ) . The finale of ' Blake's 7 ' at the end of 1981 also got up the B . B . C . ' s nose . They got more letters over that than any series finale in television history . Took was eventually retired to make way for Anne Robinson . More recently , Jeremy Vine has sat in that famous chair . ' View ' is no longer as relevant as it once was . You can find programme criticism in almost any newspaper now , on Teletext , and on the internet . But it served a purpose in letting the public have its say , even if their complaints were then ignored by B . B . C . bosses . The shrinking of end credits into a small box while clips of the next programme play has outraged viewers for years , yet the practice continues still . I will let the last words go to a viewer who thought it a strange coincidence that audiences for snooker tournaments coughed continuously during matches when the events were sponsored by tobacco firms ( this was before the ban on tobacco advertising ) . He then went on to say : " Good thing it was not sponsored by Heinz Baked Beans ! " .
Where Is Everybody ?	Jimmy Merlin ( Peter Barkworth ) is a master spy with no loyalty to either side - he simply works for whosoever pays best . When he breaks into a top secret research establishment and steals a quantity of sleep gas capsules , Steed and Tara lay in wait for him in a toy shop . Merlin uses one of the capsules to knock his enemies out , but Steed has locked the door , and he too succumbs to the effects of the gas . Steed awakens a day later - to find London strangely deserted and silent . Handcuffed to Merlin , he investigates . Martial Law has been declared and soldiers are gunning down anyone believed to be looting . An atom bomb has been found in an abandoned foreign embassy , hence the mass evacuation . In charge of the operation is Brigadier Hansing ( Joss Ackland ) . But all is not as it seems . Merlin recognises one of Hansing's soldiers as an enemy agent . . . Another regularly used idea in ' The Avengers ' was the ' where is everybody ? ' scenario . Steed and Mrs . Peel found themselves in a similar situation in ' The Hour That Never Was ' , while ' The New Avengers ' story ' Sleeper ' went one further by putting the population of London to sleep . The Brigadier's forces have emptied part of London not to dismantle an atom bomb , but to put one in ! Hansing is embittered at his impending redundancy from the army and is out to get revenge by extorting millions . Directed by John Hough ( who like Don Sharp was from the ' Hammer Horror ' school of film making ) , it boasts superb location filming , a strong script by Brian Clemens , and marvellous guest cast including Brian Blessed as ' Sgt . Hearn ' and Joss Ackland as ' Brig . Hansing ' . Stealing the show is the late Peter Barkworth ( did he ever give a bad performance ? ) as ' Merlin ' , a devious , cunning fox of a character , as charming as Steed himself . I loved his habit of conjuring playing cards at odd moments ! Pity he never returned . Poor Tara must have gotten a stronger whiff of the gas than everyone else as she spends most of the story asleep !
Law And Disorder	Not to be confused with Granada's 2002 series ' The Jury ' , this interesting drama series centred on the rape trial of a retarded man - Donald Fleming . The first twelve episodes focused on the everyday lives of the jurors , people drawn from all walks of life ( two were having a steamy affair - construction firm site manager Steve Jackson and academic Elisabeth Robbins - hence their episodes were combined . The affair did not last , much to Steve's bewilderment ) , amongst them jack-the-lad builder Mick Thompson , single mother Mary Matthews , would-be athlete Christine Cywinska , and housewife Ann Coombs , the latter having been raped herself years before , a fact she struggles to conceal from the others . The quality of the stories varied , a few veered off into soap opera , but any shortcomings were more than compensated for with the superb final episode . In true ' Twelve Angry Men ' fashion , it had the jury gridlocked over the verdict . Powerful acting from Gabrielle Lloyd and William Gaunt . Critics grumbled , at least one described it as ' the longest rape trial in history ' , but it was riveting stuff for the most part . Theme music by Sonny Rollins .
Sellers Behind A Projector !	Some films can be summed up in a single word . The one that best describes this is ' delightful ' . There I've said it . Anything else is superfluous . Written by William Rose ( author of ' Genevieve ' and ' The Ladykillers ' amongst other classics ) and directed by Basil Dearden , it begins with a young couple - the Spensers ( Bill Travers and Virginia McKenna ) - who learn they have inherited a cinema in Sloughborough in the north of England . They assume they must be getting ' The Grand ' ( it is the only cinema in the town ) , but no , theirs is the ' Bijou ' , known by locals as the ' fleapit ' . It is situated near a railway station so whenever trains fly past the building shakes as though an earthquake has hit it . The Grand's owner - tycoon Albert Hardcastle ( Francis De Wolff ) - wants the Bijou so he can knock it down and build a car park , but when he offers a paltry sum of money , the Spensers - acting on the advice of solicitor Robin Carter ( Leslie Phillips ) - re-open the place , re-hiring the original staff . A decrepit bunch they are too - Mrs . Fazackalee the cashier ( Margaret Rutherford ) Quill the alcoholic projectionist ( Peter Sellers ) and Old Tom the janitor / doorman ( Bernard Miles ) . The cinema re-opens and , after a few difficulties , proves a great success . Hardcastle is unhappy about there being a rival on his doorstep so sets about clipping the Spensers ' wings . . . ' Smallest ' is in the grand tradition of those lovely old British comedies in which people set about renovating something old and long forgotten and against all the odds succeed . In the Will Hay classic ' Oh Mr . Porter ! ' it was a railway station , here its a cinema . As ' Quill ' , Sellers is sublime , effectively re-using his ' William ' Mate ' Cobblers ' voice ( " You can't get the wood , you know ! " ) from ' The Goon Show . Real life husband-and-wife Bill Travers and Virginia McKenna are good as the ' Spensers ' , and did a number of films together , most notably ' Born Free ' . Margaret Rutherford's delightfully dotty ' Mrs . Fazackalee ' anticipated her later - and more famous - role as ' Miss Marple ' . Where the film also works is as a tribute to the golden age of cinema , in particular the Bijou's staff tearfully watching an old silent film ( while Mrs . Fazackalee plays the organ ) . Sid James is fleetingly seen as the father of the ice cream girl Marlene . She has got herself pregnant and he is not happy about the situation . Funniest moment ? When the Bijou shows a searing drama set in the desert , Old Tom adds to the viewing experience by turning up the heat . Hence the audience is just as parched as the poor guy in the movie . As soon as the interval arrives , there is a mad dash for refreshments !
" Deep , deep down ! "	On its release , Mario Bava's ' Danger : Diabolik ' was likened by critics to the ' Batman ' television series , and branded as ' campy ' . In reality , though , the two have little in common , other than both being based on comic-strips and sharing a penchant for exuberant outrageousness . ' Diabolik ' is the brilliant criminal mastermind behind the most audacious thefts in history , accomplished with the aid of amazing Bondesque gadgetry , as well as speedboats and sports cars ! The film's plot is divided into three sections ; in the first , Diabolik steals $10 million from the government , the second has him going after a priceless pearl necklace to give to his lover Eva ( the stunning Marisa Mell ) , while the third focuses on the theft of a gold ingot , and boasts some ' Thunderball'-style underwater sequences . Each step of the way , the super-crook is shadowed by the clever ( though not clever enough ) Inspector Ginko ( great name ! ) . Its interesting to view this movie now in the light of the successful Marvel Comics movie adaptations , such as the ' X-Men ' and ' Spider-Man ' trilogies . How different times were then . For one thing , there's no back story for the main character . We never find out who ' Diabolik ' is or how he got into crime , and it doesn't matter . As soon as the film gets underway , we are pitched headlong into the action . Bava apparently used the original comic strips as reference when composing shots , making the film into a living cartoon , and that's no bad thing . While hardly the world's greatest thespian , John Philip Law is perfect for the role of ' Diabolik ' - cool , handsome , and energetic . He's so likable that at times you forget he's the villain ! As ' Eva ' , the late Marisa Mell effectively secured herself a place in the affections of cult movie buffs the world over . Adolfo Celi , who plays gangster Ralph Valmont , more or less reprises his role as ' Largo ' from the Bond classic ' Thunderball ' , but again that's no bad thing . Dear old Terry-Thomas pops up now and then as a befuddled ' Minister Of Finance ' . The eye-catching sets are impressive even by today's standards , particularly Diabolik's underground lair . Who would not want to live in a place like that ? Here we get what must be the screen's kinkiest love scene , as Diabolik and Eva make out on a circular bed covered with the money they have stolen . If nothing else , it gives a new meaning to the phrase ' a big bang for your buck ' ! Unsurprisingly , this stylish , tongue-in-cheek romp has influenced many rock videos and movies over the years , amongst the latter the ' Mission Impossible ' films and Phillip Noyce's disastrous 1997 version of ' The Saint ' . If Noyce had wanted to remake ' Danger : Diabolik ' , why did he not do so , instead of attempting to transform Leslie Charteris ' suave club land hero into something he was never intended to be ? Though not a spy film per se , I think its right to lump ' Danger : Diabolik ' in with the numerous Bond knock-offs of the ' 60's , such as the ' Flint ' and ' Matt Helm ' movies . Much of the humour is Bond-like . For example , when a villain pleads with Valmont not to shoot him , Valmont lowers his gun - and then sends the terrified man plunging through a trapdoor to his death . A final mention must be made of Ennio Morricone's score which I think is marvellous , the distinctive sound of ' A Fistful Of Dollars ' filtered through ' 60's psychedelia . ' Danger : Diabolik ' was the final film to be ' riffed ' by those would-be jokers on the ( now thankfully ) defunct ' M . S . T . 3 . K . ' . I did not see that particular edition , but expect Tom Servo and co . got some comic mileage out of the film's way-out designs and ( then ) futuristic look . Oh ha-ha . How original . Whoever chose it for inclusion in that dismal show deserves to be covered from head to foot in molten gold ! ' Danger : Diabolik ' is a classic , which is more than can be said for ' M . S . T . 3 . K ' . Shame no sequels were made .
Jolly Good Show , Old Bean !	' Bullshot ' is Britain's answer to those wild , wacky spoofs such as ' Airplane ! ' and ' Blazing Saddles ' . An affectionate parody of Sapper's famous sleuth , it improves with each viewing . Hugh ' Bullshot ' Crummond is the dashing hero , yet he's a bigger fascist than his Teutonic arch-enemy , Von Bruno . Witness his stance on feminism ; " This country would be in a right mess if they let a woman become Prime Minister ! . The post-W . W . 1 atmosphere is well caught by director Dick Clement , and the cast throw themselves into the thing with gusto , particularly Alan Shearman , Diz White and Ron House ( who also wrote it ) . Frances Tomelty is stunningly sexy as the seductive Lenya , while Mel Smith , Billy Connolly and Nicholas Lyndhurst crop up in smaller roles . Much of the humour is ' end of the pier ' , such as the unseemly bulge in Crummond's underwear , and the Fokker reference , but the film's no more smutty than your average ' Cary On ' . Better than most of them in fact . Deserves a major critical reevaluation .
Surviving " Survivors "	After enduring the latest episode of B . B . C . - 1's ' Survivors ' , I watched this excellent half-hour documentary about the original show . More drama was to be found in the clips here than has so far been evident in Adrian Hodges ' hodge-podge . The opening episode - ' The Fourth Horseman ' - is an object exercise in minimalist drama . It opens with Abby Grant ( Carolyn Seymour ) , a middle-class housewife , awaiting her husband's return ( Peter Bowles , in what was basically an extended cameo ) from London . News reports are claiming that people are succumbing to a deadly new plague . Civilization is gradually breaking down , and what few survivors are left are forced to band together , to live and work as a community . It was more believable because it was seen to happen gradually . Not the case in ' Survivors 2008 ' . No sooner had the opening titles faded than Mankind was gone . The original survivors were drawn from all walks of life , featuring a smattering of elderly people , whereas the new intake are young , good-looking and more interested in sex than staying alive ( A kick up the backside to ' The Radio Times ' writer who claimed that the original was about men in jeans sitting around kitchen tables , discussing crop rotation ) . Complaints about the show being far ' too middle-class ' are trivial . When I watched ' Survivors ' , I was too absorbed in the drama to notice anyone's class . Good though the documentary was , it had flaws . The somewhat sniffy commentary would have us all believe that ' 70's Britain was not a very nice place to live , blighted by strikes , food shortages , and petrol rationing . Is today any better though ? We have had the global financial crisis ( sorted out by a Labour Prime Minister . Who would have thought it ? ) with banks collapsing and the credit crunch causing long-established firms like ' Woolworths ' to go to the wall . Will the Noughties look like Utopia to future generations ? Surprisingly unmentioned was the dispute between Terry Nation and ' Avengers ' writer Brian Clemens , who claimed the show's idea was originally his . Producer Terence Dudley was a megalomaniac , driving Nation away after the first series and then ( unforgivably ) sacking Carolyn Seymour . The show never really recovered ( Dudley's behaviour also alienated Kit Pedler and Gerry Davis , creators of his earlier sci-fi hit ' Doomwatch ' ) . Despite the production difficulties , ' Survivors ' was a cracking show , being both well acted and intelligently written . I could not believe my eyes when characters in the new show were seen accessing the internet . In one stroke the series ' purpose - the depiction of a world where Man has to learn to get by without technology - was defeated . It would be akin to a remake of ' The Changes ' having ' Nicky Gore ' using a laptop after fleeing a deserted London . It was good to see Seymour , Lucy ' Jenny ' Fleming , and Ian ' Greg ' McCulloch talking about the show , and their characters . They were indeed a great team . You cared about them . Seymour's open admission of alcoholism was indeed shocking . Director Pennant Roberts also had some interesting things to say , such as how the show had been inspired by a bestselling book on self sufficiency ( the same one also inspired the sitcom ' The Good Life ' ! ) . As it ended , I was left wanting to see the original ' Survivors ' again . If only to wipe away the memory of Adrian Hodges ' lifeless and stilted ' reimagining ' .
You Great Buttock !	My late grandfather was a bin man for forty years and he thought ' The Dustbinmen ' a great show , in fact he could put names to all the characters . Jack Rosenthal's scripts are wonderfully surreal , packed with terrific one-liners and its reasonably fair to say that the humour was on a different level to most I . T . V . comedies of that period such as say ' On The Buses ' . It was only after he left and other writers took over that it went into decline . The cast were outstanding too , particularly the late Brian Pringle as ' Cheese & Egg ' and Tim Wylton ( later to play ' Rodney Sillitoe ' in ' A Bit Of A Do ' ) as the gormless Eric . What tends to be overlooked about the show is how massively popular it was , often rivalling ' Coronation Street ' in terms of viewing figures . Watching it recently on D . V . D . I thought it stood up very well , with only the annoying ( and obvious ) canned laughter letting it down . If people cannot enjoy a series like this anymore , its very sad .
" Go on , ' ave a bit of fun ! "	With the ' Carry On ' movies proving popular both on television and in the cinema , Thames decided in 1969 to make a special for I . T . V . This uproarious parody of Dickens ' ' A Christmas Carol ' was the first of four Yuletide romps , and easily the best . Sid James starred as ' Ebenezer Scrooge ' , not merely mean but a dirty old man to boot , keeping his money under the bed in a chamber pot ! Other returning cast members included Terry Scott , Bernard Bresslaw , Charles Hawtrey , Peter Butterworth , Hattie Jacques , and Barbara Windsor . Conspicuously missing , however , was Kenneth Williams . The man with the wonderfully snide voice and flared nostrils regarded the whole enterprise as a waste of time , and in any case had signed to do a B . B . C . sketch show with Joan Sims - the disastrously received ' The Kenneth Williams Show ' . His input into ' Carry On Christmas ' would have been welcome , but its a credit to the cast that they coped rather well without him . Talbot Rothwell's innuendo-laden script stayed close to the Dickens classic , occasionally straying into the cobwebbed universe of Dracula and Frankenstein , as well as the poetic and romantic world of Robert Browning . All done in typical ' Carry On ' style , of course . The cast threw themselves into the piece with commendable enthusiasm , Butterworth and Howerd in particular looked to be having the time of their lives . As Andrew Collins noted in Channel 4's ' 100 Greatest Christmas Moments ' , the specials were cheaply made ( as indeed were the films ) and studio bound . ' Carry On ' humour was not reliant on big budgets and spectacular scenery so this was not a problem . Collins ' positive comments were overshadowed by a powerful blast of sanctimony from the editor of ' Q ' magazine , Paul Rees , who made comparisons with ' Love Thy Neighbour ' ( eh ? ) , trotted out the old ' we've thankfully moved on since ' argument and sneered : " What sort of a world was it back then ? " . Well , Paul , you would do well to learn something about that world before passing judgement . People in those days were not conditioned to think through the political ramifications of a joke before laughing - unlike yourself . I'm so glad I have never bought ' Q ' magazine . ' Carry On Christmas ' topped the ratings for that year's festive television ( Sid James fans could see their hero again on Boxing Day in the ' Two In Clover ' segment of ' All-Star Comedy Carnival ' ) , led to a further three specials , and ultimately to the disappointing ' Carry On Laughing ' , made by A . T . V . in 1975 . The idea of a ' Scrooge ' send-up was reused in 1988 by Ben Elton and Richard Curtis in the excellent ' Blackadder's Christmas Carol ' .
Apes , Pyjamas & Dr . Wellbeloved	Shelley is working on an ad campaign for striped pyjamas when a crisis interrupts his train of thought . A fellow lodger , Miss Landis , is so lonely and depressed in the big city she takes an overdose of sleeping pills . While Fran keeps watch on the girl , Shelley takes charge of the situation , calling for am ambulance and keeping nosey old Miss Ratcliffe ( Madoline Thomas ) at bay . At the hospital , Shelley does his best to explain the girl's tragic predicament to Dr . Wellbeloved ( John Savident ) . . . One of the best Season Two offerings , mainly because it gets Shelley away from the office , and has him playing hero for once , in the face of interference from busy-bodies Mrs . H and Miss Ratcliffe . The film that Shelley and Fran saw earlier in the evening is ' 2001 : A Space Odyssey ' made in 1968 . It was on re-release at that time as I saw it myself later in the year . It gives Shelley a good excuse to lighten the grim mood of the story by imitating ' Moonwatcher ' from the ' Dawn Of Man ' section of that classic . Gillian Taylforth , later to appear in ' Eastenders ' , plays ' Nurse Rowlands ' , while the thick-sculled ' Dr . Wellbeloved ' is John Savident , also to go onto soap fame by playing ' Fred Elliott ' in ' Coronation Street ' . Funniest Moment - Shelley's entire conservation with Dr . Wellbeloved , which is in similar vein to the hilarious interview with ' The D . S . S . Inspector ' from the Season 1 episode ' The Nelson Affair ' .
Meriel - Imaginary , Real Or Hallucinatory ?	1976 was a good year for anyone who loved well-crafted supernatural anthology shows . I . T . V . gave the world Nigel Kneale's ' Beasts ' , while B . B . C . - 2 had ' The Mind Beyond ' , a six-part series produced by Irene Shubik , the driving force behind the legendary science fiction series ' Out Of The Unknown ' . The first edition was ' Meriel , The Ghost Girl ' by David Halliwell . It begins when George Livingston ( the wonderful and much-missed Donald Pleasence ) , a psychical investigator , is asked to attend a séance in Cricklewood . One of the circle's number , a rich French woman , claims to have received visitations from the ghost of her late daughter Meriel , who was only seven when she died . To preserve their anonymity , the circle give themselves fake names such as ' Miss Brown and ' Mr . Green ' etc . Livingston insists on searching the room where the séance is to take place , then subjects the members of the circle to a body search . Satisfied , he allows the séance to proceed . The room goes dark and cold . The only sound to be heard is the deep breathing of the circle's members . Sensing a presence at his shoulder , Livingston reaches out and touches the naked body of a living , breathing child . Meriel has arrived . He asks her several questions , but the only one she replies to is " Do you love your mother ? " . She says yes . Meriel's mother bursts into tears . Suddenly , the ghost girl is gone . Unable to rationalise what he has seen , Livingston describes the incident in his book ' Annals Of A Psychical Investigator ' . Years later , he dies of bronchial pneumonia but the mystery of Meriel refuses to die with him . Others take up the case . The first of these is Sam Nicholls ( John Bluthal ) , a brash American with a fondness for trench coats and cigars . This poor man's Sam Spade begins to check on the authenticity of the book's details but on failing to find any concrete evidence concludes that Livingstone made the whole thing up in order to boost sales . Robina Oliver ( Janet Street-Porter . . . yes , THAT Janet Street-Porter ) is not so sure and , after searching Cricklewood , comes across a house identical to the one Livingstone described . The trail takes her to Miss Furniss ( Jane Hayden ) who claims to have been Meriel . She says she faked the apparition at the request of her parents who wanted to take the French woman for an expensive ride . Robina is sceptical . How can a fourteen year old girl realistically impersonate a seven year old ? Robina is genuinely convinced that Meriel existed . The last investigator , Dr . Delane ( Charles Keating ) , has an alternative view of the case . He thinks that she was nothing more than a mass hallucination . So what we have is a dramatised version of the ' Meriel ' incident , followed by three widely differing interpretations . Of these the Street-Porter one is the most interesting , mainly because its easy to believe Miss Furniss ' claims that the whole thing was faked . Remember that ' Sherlock Holmes ' creator Sir Arthur Conan-Doyle was fooled by some photos of ' fairies ' he once saw . Street-Porter cannot act to save her life , but thankfully she is only required to be herself . By contrast the Bluthal sequence borders on farce , with the actor behaving as though he has wandered straight off the set of Spike Milligan's ' Q ' series . The opening twenty or so minutes with Pleasence are excellent , and the séance scene registers on the ' creep-o-meter ' . When the other investigators take over it loses momentum slightly , but the theories put forward are nonetheless fascinating . The play ends with no real conclusion , the viewers are instead invited to make up their own minds . If it ever comes out on D . V . D . , I reasonably expect the scene in which Livingston encounters Meriel to be cut . This intriguing ghost story may not scare the pants off you , but it will certainly make you think .
" He's Wearing A Wig ! "	Picture the scene ; a man is idly browsing the goods on sale at a tobacconist's kiosk . The owner ( Paul Merton ) asks : " Can I help you ? " . " I'm just looking ! " the man says , to which the owner sarcastically replies : " You're not just looking . You're hearing as well . Now you're speaking . " . We cut to a field where over a soundtrack of bleating sheep , breaking glass and church bells , letters on telegraph wires spell out the show's title : PAUL MERTON THE SERIES . On a busy train , Paul is amused by a fellow passenger's obvious red wig , but says nothing . A ticket inspector enters the carriage , causing Paul to panic as he remembers he forgot to buy one . ' Wiggy ' is escorted to the guard's van for having a two year old ticket on his person . Relieved at not having been rumbled , Paul punches the air in triumph . In so doing , he draws attention to himself . In a publisher's office , McNulty , the author of a new book on Alfred Lord Tennyson , is sounded out for having crudely plagiarised other works . The entire twelfth chapter comes from a book on chickens . In the heat of the row both publisher and author reveal themselves to be fake characters in ' Mission : Impossible ' style masks . Several changes of identity later , they stand exposed as husband and wife . Cue emotional reunion . Back at the kiosk , Paul ( sporting a miniature office desk on his head ) tells us : " I've got a book at home about the paranormal . I did not buy it , it just appeared in my room one night ! " . I think by now you should have a fair idea of the general level of humour . Other surreal flights of fancy are set in a sauna bath , where Paul miraculously conjures up a pint and a cheese ommlette while imprisoned in a wooden box , Paul as a father who tells his lovely daughter Jennifer on her birthday she is ( wait for it ) NOT adopted , and a World War 2 P . O . W . sketch in which he covers for the escapees by carrying with him at all times a pole containing stuffed dummies designed to resemble the absent men . Merton's influences are plain for all to see : ' At Last The 1948 Show ' , ' Marty ' , ' Not Only But Also ' , and yes , ' Monty Python ' . He also brought back something that had been missing from television comedy for some time - visual humour . Alas the show did not make the impact it deserved . It ran only to two seasons , and is presently unavailable on D . V . D . Funniest moment - Paul's line : " My ambition is to ask Lee Harvey Oswald , can you remember where you were when Kennedy was assassinated ? " .
" I Knew I Shouldn't Have Eaten Those Radishes ! "	Of all the ' Carry On ' pictures , ' Camping ' seems to be the one most frequently shown on television , and with good reason . It is an absolute joy . Various people from all walks of life converge on the Paradise camping site . Sid Boggle ( Sid James ) and his pal Bernie Lugg ( Bernard Bresslaw ) are sexually-frustrated plumbers who have taken their girlfriends , Joan Fussey ( Joan Sims ) and Anthea Meeks ( Dilys Laye ) on holiday believing the place to be a nudist colony . Peter Potter ( Terry Scott ) and his irritating wife Harriet ( Betty Marsden ) are there too for the umpteenth year running . Frail walker Charlie Muggins ( Charles Hawtrey ) latches onto the Potters and , much to Peter's annoyance , won't leave . Then there are the nubile girls of Chayste Place school , whose number includes sexy ' Babs ' ( Barbara Windsor ) and her friend ' Fanny ' ( Sandra Caron ) . Attempting to keep them in order is the hopeless ' Dr . Soper ' ( Kenneth Williams ) and the over-sized ' Matron ' ( who else but Hattie Jacques ? ) . Over forty years after it was made , ' Camping ' still has the ability to reduce me to tears of laughter . Whether it be the opening scene in the cinema where a shocked Joan , Bernie and Anthea watch a nudist movie ( great dialogue ! ) , or Mrs . Fussey's attempts to ruin her daughter's holiday by insisting she take along everything but the kitchen sink , the sight of Scott and Marsden pedalling through the countryside on a tandem , or the sheer greed of Peter Butterworth's camp site owner as Sid counts pound notes in his presence , the film is full of treasurable comic moments . Corny gags abound , but you know you are in good hands with this cast . With the death of theatre censorship in the late ' 60's , and the explosion of interest in more violent , sexually explicit films , the ' Carry On ' series had to follow suit - or die . ' Up The Khyber ' was a step in that direction , but ' Camping ' goes further , boasting female nudity and even-bluer blue jokes than usual . We will discreetly draw a veil over the fact that the film features randy schoolgirls ( Windsor and co . looked too old for the roles anyway ) . Anna Karen ( of ' On The Buses ' ) is one , but in spite of many viewings I have never been able to spot her . Funniest moment - no , its not Babs ' bra flying off during morning exercise . Its the finale where the campers unite to get rid of hippies who have overrun a nearby field so as to stage a ' Woodstock ' style pop festival . The sight of Sid in full hippie gear cracks me up each time !
Off to work with an empty briefcase	How nice it is for me to be able to say something complimentary about a programme that was not first transmitted thirty years or so ago . The programme in question is ' Reggie Perrin ' , starring Martin Clunes . While I still think the original is a classic , the remake has a lot going for it . Clunes is shaping up nicely as ' Reggie ' . He is playing the role as though it had never been done before , which is how it should be . Had he tried to mimic Leonard Rossiter , the result would have been catastrophic . Secondly , the scripts are of a higher than standard than those we have have grown accustomed to in recent years . It is hard to tell which lines were by Simon Nye and which were by David Nobbs . Of the supporting cast , Neil Stuke's ' Chris Jackson ' is nowhere near as menacing as John Barron's ' C . J ' , but I expect this was deliberate . Susan Earl's ' Wellness Person ' is my personal favourite , and her scenes with Reggie have been ( to quote Tony Webster ) great . His putting the wind chimes down his trousers was hilarious . Like the second episode of the original , this begins with Reggie and Nicola in bed . The fire has gone out of their marriage . Whenever he tries to have some quality time with her , people show up out of the blue ; firstly , Nicola's friends , then her father William ( Geoffrey Whitehead ) , and finally Reggie's own mother ( Wendy Craig ) . William seems to have inherited Jimmy's fondness for saying ' there's been a bit of cock-up on the catering front ' . Reggie hates travelling to work by train so decides to drive one day . Big mistake . The ' Groomtech ' car park is like a maze , and Reggie becomes so frustrated he decides to leave the vehicle in any old place . Chris admonishes Reggie for going to work without a briefcase even though he never has anything in it . Reggie is all set to attend a conference with Jasmine , but after losing control of his emotions he passionately kisses her . She is horrified . There's no safari park ( there would have been no point as Tom and Linda and their awful kids do not exist in this alternative ' Perrin ' universe ) . Where the new show also scores is in making Reggie's flights of fancy even wilder . Here we saw his imaginary self shooting one of Nicola's talkative friends , sending a wrecking ball crashing into his mother , and even breathing fire at Chris ' office door . More of these please ! I love ' em ! So its a thumbs-up from me for this second episode . Can't wait to see Clunes ' ' Reggie ' leaving his clothes on a beach .
Thirteen Weeks Of Sheer Bliss !	Channel 4's ' T . V . Heaven ' set the gold standard for nostalgia shows . Each edition was devoted to a particular year , with programmes , title sequences , news footage and commercials , all ably introduced by the late , great Frank Muir . A few hailed from his time at L . W . T . , such as ' Please Sir ! ' . Among the treats on offer were the aptly-named ' The Strange World Of Gurney Slade ' starring Anthony Newley , ' A Magnum For Schneider ' starring Edward Woodward ( the pilot for ' Callan ' ) , ' Lena O My Lena ' starring Billie Whitelaw , ' The Odd Job Man ' starring Ronnie Barker and David Jason , an episode of ' Police Surgeon ' starring Ian Hendry ( the inspiration for ' The Avengers ' ) and a smattering of shows from the ITC stable , such as ' The Saint ' , ' Danger Man ' and ' The Prisoner ' . Compared with B . B . C . - 4's recent ' T . V . On Trial ' ( which was little more than an excuse for trendy media types to sneer at the past ) , ' T . V . Heaven ' was a class act . A second series , mooted at the time , sadly failed to materialise .
" A dog leading a double life ? "	In the Bronx , residents are being evicted from their homes as part of a new road construction project . Stubbornly refusing to leave is Jewish grandmother Mrs . Bronson . Because the land she lives on is city owned , the police are called in to get rid of her . Toody and Muldoon turn up with eviction papers , but she calmly puts them away along with all the others she has received . She is a spirited woman , also a good cook , and uses charm to win over her would-be evictors . In no time at all she has Toody eating homemade cake and agreeing with her rebellious stance . Muldoon tries reasoning with her , but also falls under her spell . Before the cops leave they fix her broken plumbing . Mrs . Bronson reveals the reason for refusing to move - her dog Queenie is missing , and she is frightened to leave in case it returns . Without telling the Captain , the cops begin a search for the missing animal . . . Another great episode , boasting a wonderful performance by Molly Picon as the recalcitrant ' Mrs . Bronson ' . She reprised the role in the second season episode ' Occupancy August 1st ' . When Muldoon insists she is standing in the way of progress , she retorts with ' Progress ? Because some guy in red socks wants to play golf ten minutes earlier , I have to leave my house ? " . The studio audience breaks into applause . Al Lewis appears in the show for the first time , though not as ' Leo Schnauser ' . In an amusing twist , it emerges that despite his determination to see the old lady out , Mr . Spencer is renting a room in the very house he wants demolished ! Funniest moment - disgusted at Toody and Muldoon's failure to evict Mrs . Bronson , Captain Block decides to do the job himself . His jaw firm , he strides purposefully into the building . Moments later , we see him fixing her doorbell !
Steamboat Fatty	If any single individual epitomised the alternative comedy movement of the ' 80's , it was Alexei Sayle . Looking like a newly released convict whose suit has gotten too small for him , he bludgeoned audiences into submission with a powerful blend of surreal humour and satire . Love him or hate him , you couldn't ignore him . ' Stuff ' was a good vehicle for his talents , in which the man himself sped round London on a moped , ranting on topics as diverse as fox hunting , The Royal Family , and Margaret Thatcher , as well as sketches penned by David Renwick and Andrew Marshall , some of which wouldn't have looked out of place in their L . W . T . show ' End Of Part One ' . I remember one funny ( and politically incorrect ! ) item about a Japanese car factory in the Midlands run like a W . W . 2 P . O . W . camp ! Three different title sequences were used ( the best was the Walt Disney spoof with Alexei as Mickey Mouse ! ) , all ended with someone asking : " Who's that fat bastard ? " . Genius more like .
" There'a hold-up in the Bronx . . . "	The first episode of the brilliant American sitcom ' Car 54 Where Are You ? ' which did for the N . Y . P . D . what ' Sergeant Bilko ' did for the Army . Incompetent cops Toody and Muldoon spend their free days fishing without much success . They fantasise about going to sea in an expensive boat and catching a swordfish . O'Hara , one of their colleagues at the 53rd Precinct , has just such a boat , or rather his brother-in-law has , so they ask him to let them come along on their next trip . He flatly refuses . To get him to change his mind , they embark on a campaign of ' niceness ' - filling in his police reports , sending him flowers ( causing his wife to suspect him of having an affair ) and sucking up to him in general . Irritated and annoyed , O'Hara relents . But then they cannot get time off work to go on their proposed fishing trip , hence they ask other cops to rearrange their assigned schedules . Soon the duty roster board resembles a snakes and ladders game as the changes are incorporated . When the matter finally appears settled , more trouble looms . Toody and Muldoon nab a quick-tempered motorist , Conroy , for jumping a red light . He admits his guilt , and asks for a ticket so he can go on his way . But if they comply with his request , they will have to go to court the next day and won't be free to go fishing , so they refuse . The driver insists they and no-one else give him a ticket . A fierce row develops . Bystanders look on in bemusement , as more and more cops join the fray . . . This was Nat Hiken's follow-up to the massively successful ' The Phil Silvers Show ' , and is every bit as good , and occasionally better . ' Toody ' is portrayed by ' Bilko ' semi-regular Joe E . Ross , who looks like Ernest Borgnine on a bad day . The character is not far removed from the one he played on that earlier show - ' Private Ritzik ' . As well as exclaiming " oooh ! oooh ! " every time he has an idea , he also has a domineering wife ( Beatrice Pons played both ' Emma Ritzik ' and ' Lucille Toody ' ) . Tall , gangling Fred Gwynne , a . k . a . ' Muldoon ' , was in two episodes of ' Bilko ' as ' Private Honergan ' , but is more famous as ' Herman ' from ' The Munsters ' . This script , like the best of ' Bilko ' , begins with a basic premise . Lesser writers might have stretched it to fill the entire half-hour , but Hiken gets it over with quickly and moves on , making all kind of unexpected detours , resulting in comedic chaos . Superb dialogue throughout . Funniest moment - the angry confrontation between Toody , Muldoon and the motorist must rank as one of the funniest scenes in any show and surely must have inspired John Cleese to create the legendary ' Fire Drill ' sequence in ' Fawlty Towers ' ! As the last cop joins in the mêlée , he comments : " A good thing he wasn't speeding or we'd have had to call in The National Guard ! " . A sheer delight !
" Harold . . . you're on the turn ! "	Harold is collecting what he thinks are valuable antiques for his private collection . When his father accidentally destroys a Burnt Jones painting with a blow lamp ( " This Burnt Jones is more Burnt than Jones ! " ) , they are at loggerheads once more . Their row is interrupted by the arrival of Timothy Stanhope ( Richard Hurndall ) , an elegantly dressed antiques dealer . He sees only one thing of interest in the junkyard - Harold . Harold in turn is fascinated by the older man's sartorial flair and good manners . Albert is horrified at what he perceives to be a change in his son's sexuality . . . When this was made , homosexuality had been legal in Britain for four years , yet it still possessed a stigma in the minds of the older ( and some of the younger ) generation . ' Queer bashing ' continued , while derogatory words like ' poof ' were bandied about in the popular press well into the ' 80's . Of course Harold is not turning gay , but when he responds positively to Stanhope's charm the old man deduces the worst . ' Stanhope ' is played by the late Richard Hurndall , whom ' Dr . Who ' fans will remember replaced William Hartnell as the First Doctor in the 1983 anniversary special ' The Five Doctors ' . When it was repeated on B . B . C . - 2 back in the ' 90's , a gay man wrote to ' Points Of View ' angrily objecting to the homophobic stance adopted by Albert , and suggested the episode be ' never shown again ' . The B . B . C . pointed out that the attitudes were of a different era . I think it would be sad if all programmes depicting old fashioned views were left to gather dust on a shelf for all eternity . That is why I find archive television fascinating - I like looking back to see what people were thinking and doing decades ago . The complainant over-reacted in my view . Funniest moment - Albert looking aghast as Harold walks into the living room dressed in trendy clothes - and carrying a men's shoulder-bag !
" What's it like for crumpet ? "	Harold is dating the very sexy Marcia Wigley ( Lynn Farleigh ) , who describes both herself and her husband as ' swingers ' , even though he cannot do much swinging as he is currently in jail . They both want to go up to Harold's room , but Albert is making a racket by mending old shoes . Finally , believing the old man to be asleep , they both creep upstairs . Harold's lust is dampened as Marcia screams on catching sight of a bed-bug . After she flees the house , Harold resolves to get a new bed . . . I doubt whether a plot like this would have been used in the original series - well , at least , Harold's true intention for the bed would not have been so graphically depicted . I recall on ' Points Of View ' viewers complaining about what they perceived to be a ' coarsening ' of the series ' humour , when all that had happened was that it had moved with the times . Great bed shop scene , with Harold trying to impress the camp salesman ( Angus Mackay ) by using French , anticipating ' Del Boy Trotter ' of ' Only Fools & Horses ' by a few years . As soon as Harold and Albert walk in , the salesman tells them : " The betting shop's next door ! " . When the old man goes to light a Turkish fag , he almost chokes . Then he leaves horse dung on one of the beds . Water beds were fashionable around that time , though only for the well-off . Albert's initial contempt turns to admiration . " You needn't worry about bed bugs . . . it'll drown the little bleeders ! " . Lynn Farleigh is very good as the willing ' Marcia ' . She is still acting I believe . Good for her . Funniest moment - Harold and Marcia sweeping romantically into each other's arms , falling onto the water bed , which then bursts open ! A classic Steptoe moment . Second funniest moment - Blink and you will miss it but , over the end credits , Harold - looking like Jack Nicholson's axe man from ' The Shining ' - can be seen trying to break down the door to Albert's room while the old man cowers in terror under the mattress ! We can but wonder what happened next . . .
An Everyday Story Of A Monk Falling In Love With A Hooker !	' In God We Tru$t ' opened to a unanimous drubbing from critics and public alike . Universal terminated Marty's contract , plunging him into suicidal despair . Actually , its quite a clever satire on the commercialisation of religion , Christianity in particular . Many attacked the film on the basis that it was somehow blasphemous , which is ridiculous . Marty Feldman gives a delightful performance as ' Brother Ambrose ' , a monk who ventures into the outside world to seek financial help for his monastery , and is appalled at what he finds . Peter Boyle's mobile church has to be seen to be believed ! Andy Kaufman almost steals the film as ' Armaggeddon T . Thunderbird ' , a charlatan of the first order , and Louise Lasser is terrific as the hooker who captures Brother Ambrose's heart . The film combines satire with slapstick to hilarious effect , and the scene with Richard Pryor as G . O . D . is classic ! Despite putting paid to Marty's popularity in the U . S . A . , this underrated comedy deserves a major revaluation .
Mr . Parris ' Worst Week !	Back in Thatcher's Britain , rent-a-quote Tory M . P . Matthew Parris overstepped the mark by claiming benefit claimants had it easy . Granada's ' World In Action ' challenged him to sign on the dole for one week , and he did . Guess what ? He couldn't live on the money ! ' World In Action ' was a hard-hitting current affairs programme that dared to cover issues ignored by the rest of the news media . During its incredible four-decade run , it covered amongst other things the rise of the National Front , militant infiltration of trade unions , the decline of the N . H . S . , questioned whether The Queen should pay tax , presented debates both for and against the restoration of capital punishment , and interviewed Thatcher before she became P . M . It lacked ' gimmicks ' such as bimbo presenters , dramatic music and glitzy sets , and went for the jugular . ' World ' was axed in 1999 , for reasons that are still unclear . In its old slot - Monday 8 . 30 P . M . - you can now see . . . another episode of ' Coronation Street ' ! Who says British television has dumbed down ?
Trouble At The Drillhead	One of the few disadvantages the new ' Doctor Who ' has is its inability to gradually develop a feeling of menace . With only forty-five minutes to tell the story , it would be an expensive luxury . The setting and characters have to be established quickly , so we can get onto the monsters . The original ' Dr . Who ' had no such constraints , of course , and nowhere is this better illustrated than in the opening instalment of ' Inferno ' . It opens at a top secret complex somewhere in England , where a Government-funded plot is underway to seek a new source of energy by breaking through the Earth's crust . Sir Keith Gold is showing Greg Sutton around the control centre , while elsewhere a rigger named Slocum touches a green slime oozing from one of the outlet pipes . When we next see him he has transmogrified into a vicious , green-skinned monster . The pacing is slower than today's drama , the exposition more detailed , yet this is a good opener to what turned out to be one of the all-time great ' Dr . Who ' stories .
" Kids ' programme ! "	As far as I - and millions of other British kids - were concerned , ' The Goodies ' could do no wrong in 1973 . We lapped up each new series ( including repeats ) , laughed at the comic strip in ' Cor ! ' , and us lucky ones got the 1974 Annual in our Christmas stocking . Such was the level of interest in ' The Goodies & The Beanstalk ' that people were raving about it before it had even been shown . How , I hear you ask ? Simple . B . B . C . - 2's trailer was composed of a generous chunk of the climactic bird attack . After seeing the lads dive bombed by golden-egg laden geese to the sound of the ' Dambusters March ' , there was no way any of us were going to miss the actual show . It was their first attempt at a Christmas Special , though the previous year they had put out ' The Goodies ' Five-Minute Travelling Christmas ' as part of ' Christmas Night With The Stars ' . Here they got to do a whole show based on the old fairytale ' Snow White & The Seven Dwarfs ' ( according to the opening credits ) . Tim , Bill and Graeme have fallen on hard times . After failing as buskers , they decide to sell their only possession - Buttercup the three-wheeled bicycle . Bill is lucky to get a tin of beans for it . Graeme plants one , and lo and behold , a beanstalk shoots into the sky . Pursuing it across the channel to France , they become contestants on ' Jeux San Frontieres ' - the European version of ' Its A Knockout ' - , hosted by the late , much-missed Eddie Waring ( often the target of Graeme's impersonations , he was a good sport for doing this . Note the huge cheer he gets when he appears ! ) Surviving various obstacles , such as having coconuts thrown at them by Man Friday and swinging on a rope over a tank of piranha fish , they climb the beanstalk . Somewhere in the clouds there lives a giant , and when I tell you he is played by diminutive Alfie Bass I need say no more . Its impossible to list one outstanding funny moment from this - there are so many . The dancing copper , Graeme switching on a plant to read a book at night , the beanstalk crashing into the B . B . C . Centre where Corbet Woodall ( great guy ! ) is reading the news , the spoof ad offering puppies as prizes in a competition , Tim eavesdropping on female nudists ( hope Mrs . Whitehouse never saw this bit ) , the lads ' singing in a canyon and creating wonderful echoes , Bill trying to encourage hens to lay golden eggs and instead getting a brick , Alfie Bass bellowing ' fee-fi-fo-fum ' through a loudhailer , the ' Who Wants To Be A Millionaire ? ' song number with the lads dressed as the Marx Bros . , and of course , the aforementioned finale which also features Alfred Hitchcock and a giant hobnailed boot . All capped by a fabulous cameo from John Cleese as a genie ! Bass had earlier appeared in the ' Camelot ' episode that opened Season 4 , though as a different character . This is I think the best of his performances . He is a little man pretending to be a giant , and gets some cracking lines : " Have you ever tried cleaning a ten-foot high toilet bowl ? Come to think of it , have you ever tried using one ? " . I cannot remember what else was on telly on Christmas Eve 1973 , but I doubt whether it was outstanding as this . It was the work of three top-flight comedians at their peak . It went down so well it was repeated several times in the course of the decade , and was the first ' Goodies ' episode to come out on video . Channel 5 showed it as part of a Boxing Day ' 70's comedy theme night ( now why don't they do that anymore ? ) in 2004 . I do not know what first-timers made of it , but I thought it stood up well . Times may change , but fairy tales thankfully do not . The Goodies had a couple of Season 4 episodes left to see us into the New Year , but were largely absent from our screens in 1974 . When they returned a year later , however , it would be with a bang .
Punkerella !	The Goodies have formed a band called ' The Little Laddies ' . Their first attempt at a hit - ' Shiny Shoes ' - flops , partly because it is awful , but also because the group is perceived as old fashioned . Bill wants to go punk . ' The Little Laddies ' split up . Tim dates the attractive music journalist Caroline Kook , and takes her to a restaurant . But it has changed hands ; Graeme runs it now , and caters exclusively to punk rockers . Punk culture spreads like wildfire ; everyone is making their hair spiky , sticking safety pins through their noses and acting aggressively , even Michael Barrett of ' Nationwide ' and astronomer Patrick Moore get in on the act . At the Trendsetters ' Ball , punk rockers wait to see what the next youth culture trend will be . The winner will get Caroline's hand in marriage . Tim is determined to win . . . One thing television does not do anymore is to ridicule youth culture . With more and more modern comedies being aimed at the youth market , writers and producers are not going to risk offending their audience , so they put the boot into old people and ' 70's fashions instead . The last show brave enough to blow a raspberry at the young was the excellent ' Nathan Barley ' - cancelled after one season . But in 1977 , things were different . With the tabloids railing against the ' punk rock ' phenomenon , particularly in the wake of the notorious Bill Grundy ' Sex Pistols ' interview , the time was right for ' The Goodies ' to tackle the subject . It proved to be one of their most controversial episodes ever . The B . B . C . , bless ' em , still thought of ' The Goodies ' as a kids ' show , and felt ' punk rock ' an unsuitable subject for a prime-time audience ( even on B . B . C . - 2 ) . ' The Goodies ' were told to drop the idea . After much negotiating , and some script rewriting , it got made . Interestingly , it does not come out against ' punk ' , but simply shows what might happen if it were taken to extremes . The punk hospital , for instance , where patients are treated without anaesthetic , and the punk restaurant , where diners go to be sickened by the awful food . The Cinderella parody has punks sawing off their legs so as to win the hand of the lovely Caroline . Jane Asher is cast as ' Caroline Kook ' , a character based on the real-life journalist Caroline Koon , who was one of punk's first supporters . ' The Little Laddies ' were based on ' The Little Ladies ' , a fictitious girl group from the I . T . V . drama series ' Rock Follies ' . Funniest moment - Tim getting drenched in spaghetti sauce !
" I've heard of carrying the can , but this is ridiculous ! "	Legendary Scottish comedian Stanley Baxter made five lavish comedy spectaculars for L . W . T . in the ' 70's , of which this was the third . It begins with Baxter's radio announcer - ' Julie Hawn ' - introducing several spoof commercials ( including clever parodies of the Milk Tray and P . G . Tips ' Mr . Shifter ' ads ) . Then we move onto classic sketches such as ' Towering Quake 75 ' , a Party Political Broadcast on behalf of The Mafia , ' Police 3 And A Half ' ( with Baxter impersonating Shaw Taylor ) , and ' Los Paranoics ' , a Latin-American singing group whose membership has mysteriously expanded to include the Scottish broadcaster Fyffe Robertson . Some items go on a bit too long , most notably ' Faith To Faith ' , but there's no denying the fact that Baxter is a brilliant impersonator and every penny of the budget is up on screen . The obligatory Hollywood musical pastiche here is ' Born To Bitch ' , with Baxter as ' Vicki Lustre ' ( based on ' Vicki Lester ' - the Judy Garland character from ' A Star Is Born ' ) ' . The music , choreography and sets are spot on . Even if you do not like old musicals ( and I don't ) you will be impressed . On the down side , there are a number of racist jokes no-one would dare make now , and the scene where Baxter ( in drag ) moves to attack Denise Coffey's pigtailed little girl with a bread knife is surprisingly graphic for a comedy show . Even so , a tremendous piece of entertainment .
The Elisabethan Sitcom	' Blackadder 2 ' provoked outrage when first broadcast in the U . K . Those who'd liked the first series were extremely unhappy at the show's reformatting ; Nina Myskow , television critic of ' The News Of The World ' bestowed on Rowan Atkinson her infamous ' wally of the week ' title . Its only with the benefit of hindsight can we see now that the changes were absolutely spot-on ; Edmund becoming a sarcastic cad , Baldrick turning stupid , and the expensive film sequences dropped in favour of stronger characterisations and tighter plots . Without the likes of Brian Blessed to constantly upstage him , Atkinson was free to dominate the show . Ben Elton replaced Atkinson as Richard Curtis ' co-writer - another wise move . As the squeaky-voiced ' Queenie ' , Miranda Richardson was simply outstanding . Tom Baker played ' Captain ' Redbeard ' Rum ' in one episode , a tour-de-force of over-the-top acting . The weight of public opinion gradually swung behind ' Blackadder 2 ' - its now regarded as better than its predecessor .
The ' War & Peace ' Of Television	When the American mini-series ' Roots ' debuted on B . B . C . - 1 in 1978 , I was pretty cynical . Here we go again , I thought , yet another overblown soap opera , ' Rich Man , Poor Man ' Mark Two . I do not know what compelled me to tune in for the first instalment , but am so glad I did , else I would have then missed one of the greatest series of all time . Based on the book by Alex Haley , the story begins with his ancestor Kunta Kinte ( LeVar Burton ) disobeying his father's advice by venturing beyond the perimeters of his African village to find wood with which to make a drum for his baby brother . He is caught by slave traders , who ship him back to the United States in the most appalling conditions imaginable to begin a new life as a slave called ' Toby ' . The scene where Kunta is incarcerated in chains and screams at the top of his lungs is one of the most harrowing ever broadcast , and shocks still . Making repeated escape attempts , Kunta has part of his foot chopped off . Years pass , and he marries another slave named Bell ( Madge Sinclair ) , and they have a daughter called Kizzy ( Leslie Uggams ) . She is taught to read and write by the spoilt daughter of her owner , a fact that ultimately leads to her being sold off to the disgusting Tom Moore ( Chuck Connors ) , a man who thinks nothing of having sex with his female slaves . I will leave the synopsis here . ' Roots ' is an epic that spans decades , taking in major historical events such as the American Civil War , and although grim for most of the time ends on a note of optimism for the future . It brought history to life in a way no book could ever hope to do . My knowledge of the shameful age of slavery was increased a thousandfold . With race riots having been in the news only a few years earlier , it made me think : " my God , no wonder the blacks hate us . " . It took stick from some quarters over historical accuracy . While it is true that the African village seen at the start of the series was like something out of an old ' Tarzan ' movie the sense that a monstrous injustice had been committed was there . Yes , Haley took liberties ( it is called ' artistic licence ' ) , but did not invent slavery . He did not need to because it actually happened . If nitpickers want to remain blinkered to the evils of history , that's fine by me . As long as they do not expect everyone else in the world to think the same way . John Amos as the adult ' Kunta ' , Lou Gossett Jr as ' Fiddler ' , Leslie Uggams as ' Kizzy ' , and , in particular , Ben Vereen as ' Chicken George ' were brilliant , and the show not only was viewed by the highest audience in American history ( at that time ) , but also won countless awards , including the prestigious Peabody ( which Bill O'Reilly later claimed to have won ! ) . I doubt it but hope Enoch Powell ( and those cretins who marched in support of his extreme views ) was among the millions who saw it in Britain . Interestingly , 1978 was also the year in which ' The Black & White Minstrel Show ' ( a singing / dancing variety show starring white performers in minstrel make-up ) ended after a twenty-year run . After ' Roots ' , those hand-waving ' yassuh , boss ! ' stereotypes were no longer welcome on our screens . Though repeated several times , ' Roots ' has not been seen here for years , but thankfully is on D . V . D . It should be compulsive viewing in all schools .
" Why are lions lions ? "	The second episode of ' Fall & Rise ' saw Gareth Gwenlan assuming directorial responsibilities ( taking over from John Howard Davies ) and he remained with the show until its end ( and he helmed the 1996 sequel ' The Legacy Of Reginald Perrin ' ) . There is no difference between this and the previous instalment , they look like they were the work of the same man . Reggie is in bed with Elisabeth , feeling depressed because he is unable to make love to her . When the neighbours return from their ' snifter ' at the golf club , he vents his fury . Acting on his wife's advice , Reggie goes to see C . J . to ask for a month off . But he gets scared in his boss ' presence ( and anyway he is needed to supervise the new exotic ice creams project ) so backs down . C . J . gives him the afternoon off instead . Reggie's hopes for a peaceful afternoon at home are dashed when brother-in-law Jimmy ( Geoffrey Palmer ) shows up , and in what would be the start of a running gag , asks for food on the grounds that there has been a ' cock-up on the catering front ' . He even takes the fillet steak Reggie had planned on having for dinner . Linda ( the stunning Sally-Jane Spencer ) is next to invade the Perrin household , and reminds Reggie about the trip to the safari park lined up the next day . Reggie has an awful time , trapped in a car not only with Elisabeth , Linda , but her trendy husband Tom ( Tim Preece ) and their horrid children , Adam and Jocasta . Something has got to give , and does . . . This is where we first meet Major Jimmy Anderson , a scrounger of the first order , superbly played by Geoffrey Palmer . The character's habit of using clipped , militaristic phrases such as ' odd chaps women ' , ' Johnny Foreigner ' , and ' well done that man ! ' made him almost as popular as Reggie himself , and in the mid-80's , David Nobbs gave him his own spin-off series ( sort of ) in the form of Channel 4's underrated ' Fairly Secret Army ' . Tom is a wonderful example of the ' new age ' man ; he brews his own wine ( made from vegetables ) , smokes briar pipes , gives his children pretentious-sounding names , eats garlic-flavoured squid , and says nothing in his defence when Reggie brazenly insults him . He is a bit like ' Tom Good ' of ' The Good Life ' only much worse . Funniest moment - Adam announces he has just done ' biggies ' in his pants , and Tom says " That's not a good idea . old chap . It will get uncomfortable for you later on . " to which Reggie replies : " And not just for him ! " . If Adam sounds strange it is because he was dubbed by an adult performer ( a common practice in films / television in those days ) .
A Traitor In The White House	Senator William Lyons Selby is the favourite to be the next President of the U . S . A . The Chinese Communists know this , and have created a perfect double using a revolutionary ' molecular plasticity ' serum . The night before the election , Selby is quietly assassinated and the double takes his place . As expected , he wins by a landslide . On entering The White House , the double starts to undermine U . S . defence and foreign policy . His daughter notices the sudden change in her father's character , as do his aides . But how do they prove he is an impostor ? The second broadcast episode of ' The Outer Limits ' is noticeably different from all others ; being more of a political thriller akin to Richard Condon's ' The Manchurian Candidate ' . The only fantasy element is the method used to turn a Chinese agent into Selby's double . Anti-Communist propaganda ? Certainly . But in 1963 the West did feel genuinely threatened by the East , and this episode caught the mood of the time . As Selby , the late Sidney Blackmer is superb , one could easily picture someone like him becoming President . The only false note struck by this chilling episode is the melodramatic finale in which the plot is exposed in the middle of a White House reception . I must mention Dominic Frontiere's eerie music , definitely a major factor in this episode's success .
