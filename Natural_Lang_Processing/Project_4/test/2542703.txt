The Hoax is On Us	Confusing , muddled film dealing with Clifford Irving's alleged meeting with Howard Hughes and the false book that he comes out with . The film shows that the book written by Irving may have caused the Nixon Whitehouse to begin the break in at Watergate . Had the film concentrated on this , it would have been a powerful story . Instead , we are constantly confused by what is going on here . Alfred Molina and Marcia Gay Harden do give convincing performances as his friend , and wife , caught up in this hoax . Gere is hopelessly miscast here . He looks much older here and by the way , was his face stretched ?
40 Year Old Virgin : Sexless , Moronic and Hopeless	Hollywood reached a new low with this idiotic farce about a 40 year old nice looking guy who works in an electronic store . His weekends include fussing over egg-salad . Somehow , his co-workers at the store find out about his virginity and that's when the picture deteriorates quickly into ridiculous situations , stupid dialogue-i . e . One of the coworkers thinks at first that our hero is gay . He tells him that when he was in Hebrew school , he touched the testicles of a fellow student . Our hero has a chance encounter with a lady who has been drinking . She vomits all over him in a car . Come on , Hollywood ! You could do far better than this idiotic movie which is appropriate for sex-hungry morons . Katherine Keener is again wasted as the girl across the street . She is a fine actress but has not been getting the great parts . There was nothing to her in " Capote " as Harper Lee .
I Know Who Killed Me - How About Who Killed this Film ?	Absolute trash starring Lindsay Lohan . The girl has to be quite desperate to sign on to such rubbish . After giving up her promising piano career to pursue writing , Lohan is viciously attacked and loses limbs in the process . She is found and regains consciousness only to claim that she is someone else . What follows is far too grizzly to talk about . Suffice to say , it's absolutely disgusting . This is nothing more than a very cheap attempt to capitalize on horror films . The very horror is this film itself . Certainly not recommended for the squeamish and anyone who calls themselves normal .
I Was Up in Arms After Seeing this Picture	A colossal Danny Kaye bomb . It's amazing that Danny's film career went anywhere after a film as miserable as this . This was not the film to showcase his talents . Dana Andrews was not for musicals . It was as simple as that . He played his sidekick in this and was Jeanne Crain's love interest in " State Fair . " Andrews hit his stride in " The Best Years of Our Lives . " Danny is a severe hypochondriac in this film . He gets drafted and loves Constance Dowling who doesn't have the heart to tell him that it's Andrews who is her love interest . Dinah Shore , as Virginia , loves Danny but he can't see it . General mayhem develops when all 4 of the characters are on the ship and Dowling becomes a castaway by accident . Look for Margaret Dumont in 2 brief scenes . I guess she was taking a respite from the Marx Brothers . She is not even at her gawky best here . Also miscast are Louie Calhern and Lyle Talbot , both wonderful character actors , who have little to do here and are wasted . Dinah sings nicely and I guess that she and Kaye make a nice Jewish couple . That's about it .
Ocean's 13 - Drown It	Even an all-star cast can't save this misery of a movie . Danny Ocean is back with his pack ready for another caper . The original Ocean's 11 was lousy and believe me , this one is no better . I love Al Pacino's flaming red hair . At the beginning , I actually thought that Pacino's character would rival that in the wonderful Dick Tracy film . That role got him a supporting Oscar nomination . This picture he'd go absolutely nowhere . How about a little more excitement here such as terrorizing Elliott Gould ? Carl Reiner looked like he was ready to attend a Brighton Beach outing in this film . Bernie Mac at the gambling table ? He looked more like a super fool here . Ellen Barkin was just ridiculous in her role as Mr . Bank's ( Pacino's ) subordinate . By the way , what's going on here ? Are our motley crew more interested in breaking the bank or getting that piece of jewelry . Even the alleged earthquake scene was dull . Old ladies in a nursing home could run out faster in their wheelchairs . A thoroughly ridiculous , poorly written film . Scrap it to the garbage dump .
Kremlin Letter - Writing to Nowhere	This has to rate as one of the worst films ever despite an all-star cast . The plot is extremely muddled . What's with this letter ? What is the contents of this ? Can you just imagine George Sanders knitting and in drag ? No wonder he killed himself 2 years later . This film is living proof that no matter who the cast members are , if the writing is bad , forget it . I found it obnoxious with the Boone-O'Neal relationship of constantly calling one another uncle-nephew . Given the character that Boone was , did he arrange for the murder of of O'Neal's family . The great John Huston directed this mess . He had a very brief part . Better to run from the cameras period . A totally colossal bore . How many films can you sit through and have no understanding whatsoever of the plot ? This is the picture .
Another Woman , Another Stinker	Marion is the head of the Philosophy Department at a college who takes a leave of absence to write a book . As far as I'm concerned , she ( Gena Rowlands ) should have taken a leave from this terrible film . Marion , as in the case with too many of Woody's characters , has emotional hangups . Writing a book , the woman needed to be in therapy real fast . There is so much going on in this movie that yentas sitting in front of a building couldn't report it as quickly . Marion is on her 2nd marriage . Her husband is a cold doctor played by Ian Holm . At a pre-wedding party , Holm's first wife came in to slap her husband and condemn Marion for taking her husband away from her . Then , there's Holm's daughter , Martha Plimpton , who gets along very well with Marion but has her own emotional problems . Complicating all this , Marion's mother has died within the past few months , and her father , played by John Houseman , can't really dispose of his wife's belongings . A flashback shows him as a younger man ( played by David Ogden Stiers ) telling his son to work in a cardboard factory so that Marion can go to college . After talking about her friend , the latter suddenly shows up . Sandy Dennis , as the friend , condemns Marion for paying too much attention to her husband as well as a previous boyfriend . How could I forget to mention that Holm's friend , Gene Hackman , makes a play for Marion at the pre-wedding party . In writing her book , Marion can hear a psychiatrist talking in the next room to a patient . ( Mia Farrow ) Later , Marion befriends Farrow and then loses her as the movie thankfully ends . The film , which was Houseman's last , is ridiculous at best . Houseman looked in great pain . ( He died the same year . ) He managed to deliver his lines like Prof . Kingsfield in " The Paper Chase . " Dennis was very swollen , dying of cancer 4 years later , she was probably taking treatments . The best part of this farce is that Marion is recognizing that her marriage to Holm is coming apart . They are never alone and no longer sleep together . Naturally , while in a restaurant with Farrow , Marion sees Holm with a friend . It is tiring to see these emotionally strung-up women and men act out their problems . In a world full of problems , we don't need theirs .
Ambassador's Daughter-Get Diplomatic Immunity from this One	Simply miserable film starring Olivia de Havilland as the daughter of the American ambassador to France . The trouble is that Edward Arnold , the ambassador , and the visiting senator Adolphe Menjou have very little to do in this hopeless film . It's basically the story of an engaged woman who meets a soldier by chance and the two engage in a whirlwind romance throughout Paris . Tommy Noonan as the friend of John Forsythe , the guy who courts de Havilland , and Myrna Loy , as the senator's wife , are both unable to salvage a poorly written film . At age 39 , Miss de Havilland was way too old for the part . The story is nonsensical at best and Forsythe confusing de Havilland as a kept woman of the older Menjou is not written up to the hilt as it should have been . A shame that such a talented cast of thespians were wasted on this nonsense .
The Uninvited-Don't Bother to Knock	One step beyond awful describes this supposedly eerie film . Teaching in an urban school setting is far more scarier than this film which is really quite a stinker . Amazing that Ray Milland's following film earned him an Oscar . Goes to show you how versatile some of these actors are . The only good thing about this misery is the fine musical score by Victor Young . What a waste on such a terrible film . A brother and sister buy a haunted house . Naturally , there is a story attached to it but why bother to explain this nonsense . As far as the acting goes , there is one decent performance by Cornelia Otis Skinner who was better noted for her writing . Her part would have been perfect for Gale Sondergaard . In fact , Skinner resembled Miss Sondergaard . She plays a lunatic nurse owning an asylum . Believe me , she should have been one of the patients along with the writers of the film . Ray Milland and sister Ruth Hussey purchase this home in rural England in 1937 . The mayhem begins immediately as the owner of the place , who fell off a rock , haunts the place . Her daughter , played by Gail Russell , lives with grandpa Donald Crisp . Even Crisp is off his mark here . He is another victim of the plot and poor writing .
Don't Jump in the Lake House	Absolutely dismal story of a current occupant and past one of a lake home . They meet by mail and must find a way for a more meaningful relationship until it's too late . As far as I'm concerned , it was already too late . The film is quite dull and Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock both appear to be totally frustrated with it . There is a cameo appearance by Christopher Plummer who portrays an embittered father , who as a famous architect never got over the fact that his wife left him with the 2 sons . Plummer quickly exits due to two heart attacks that he suffers . Unfortunately , this film is enough to bring another one on . One day , Bullock sits with her mother outside only to witness a man struck by a car . Though she portrays a physician , there is little she can do but watch the victim expire . There is also little that can be done with this film . A real total sleeper .
Grumpier Old Men Too Sedate	While Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau were an excellent team , they bombed in this film but good . What's so grumpy about Lemmon in this film ? The prequel was much better . Ann Guilbert , as Sophia Loren's mother , is given little to do . Remember her as the grandmother to " The Nanny ? " Sophia Loren , other than marrying Matthau , is also give nothing to do . Ditto for Ann-Margret , Darryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak , all of whom were so good in the original but are reduced to practically nothing here . I also resent Matthau , who shows off his part-Jewish heritage marrying in a church at the end . I found this to be offensive . Sorry , but that's the way I am-old fashioned . To all those criticize me for the last statement , how would you have felt if the Matthau-Loren nuptials had taken place in a synagogue ? While I realize that this was a comedy , this still left me with a bad taste in my mouth . A non-religious setting would have been the only solution to this .
Sell Out is No Bargain	Oliver Reed looks like he is ready to continue his memorable turn of Bill Sykes in this so called thriller . Trouble is that he has been thrown into an absolutely muddled stinker along with Richard Widmark . Widmark is supposed to be Jewish here living in Israel as a retired CIA agent . The only things we can relate to Widmark and Judaism was that his ex-son-in-law was Sandy Koufax and he was absolutely brilliant as the prosecuting attorney in " Judgment at Nuremberg , " 15 years before he made this ridiculously confusing film . Gail Hunnicutt plays the girlfriend of both Reed and Widmark . She tends to play both ends until it's discovered what her real game is and she pays for it with a bullet . The same bullet needed to be shot into this awful script . As an agent who defected to the Soviet Union , Reed wants to come back to the American side and this causes havoc . However , the film never explains why Widmark is also marked for death . The ending scenes as the duo attempt to flee to Jordan are so dark that you can't see anything . Absolutely miserable production . Assaf Dayan , the son of Moshe , appears in this film , but he is hardly noticed .
How to Be Very , Very Popular - Is Anything But	The film starts off as if I was seeing " Some Like it Hot " years before . Two strip-tease dancers witness the shooting death of a Chinese stripper on stage and are pursued by police and the killer alike . Sounds funny and promising but the film soon falls into a trap of utter stupidity . Bette Grable ( too old for the part ) and Sheree North are the two fleeing strippers who wind up in a college dormitory and cause mayhem there . North is accidentally hypnotized by Tommy Noonan and spends much of the picture in a hypnotic state . How fortunate for her . There are two really good performances here by Charles Coburn , as the college dean , more interested in the college getting money than actually providing education and Alice Pearce , as a wacky housemother in the school . Fred Clark , as the millionaire father , who doesn't know that his son , Orson Bean , has been expelled is given the part of the guy getting hit over the head as he is confused with the killer . Rhys Williams gets the same treatment as North's father . Bette Grable plays Stormy Tornado . Stormy ? This storm blew out to sea . Big-time .
Fun With Dick & Jane-See Reviewer Run ( Away )	A serious topic regarding the corporate scandals is foolishly dealt with in this inane comedy . Jim Carrey and Tea Leoni star in this nonsense where Carrey is promoted as a VP of a corporation and is promptly used for the demise of the business . Naturally , the CEO ( Alec Baldwin ) runs away with the money . Reduced to having nothing as Leoni quits her job , the two resort to robbing banks and are pretty good at it until they see fellow workers arrested for doing the same thing . The rest of the film is devoted to turning the tables on Baldwin . Silly fun with a first grade humor of Dick and Jane . Not recommended for anyone and especially first graders !
Seraphim Falls - A Major Flop	You go over an hour and a half before you know why Pierce Brosnan is being pursued by Liam Neeson . The latter comes off as a vicious killer , killing his own people along the way . This is a post-civil war western . Believe me , the westerns they made in the 1950s were far superior to this long and often boring cat and mouse chasing scene . The picture has beautiful cinematography going for it . Unfortunately , that's about it . It becomes a wild shooting spree . What is the purpose of Anjelica Huston's bit-part as a lady with tonics at the end ? Has Miss Huston's career gone that far downhill that she has to subject her acting talents to this junk ? After all that goes on , the two guys walk away in the end . This is another Duel in the Sun without the deaths in the end . A major disappointment . Liam Neeson , " Since Schindler's List , " your career has taken a dive by a series of miserable films . Ditto for Brosnan . Get him back as 007 . " The Matador " and this other bomb will not help .
The Interpreter Gets Lost in Translation	Muddled , often confusing account of an assassination attempt on an African leader . Nicole Kidman translates an African dialect at the U . N . but how increasingly involved does she become in the assassination plot ? In a post - world , we don't need seeing a Nostrand Ave . bus being blown up . The corrupt African leader looks just like Nelson Mandela ? Were the writers of this junk trying to tell us something ? Penn's wife was just killed in a New Mexico auto accident ? What's the point of all this ? There is no relevance of this tragedy whatsoever to the story . The ending was pointless and confusing . What were the bad guys trying to accomplish ?
This Celebrity is Just Not that Famous to Me	Kenneth Branagh assumed the part that a younger Woody Allen would have had in " Celebrity . " As always , this Woody Allen creation deals with relationships . Judy Davis steals this film in the role of a plain-Jane looking woman who is divorced by Branagh , as he is looking for more fulfillment in his life . While in an office regarding a face lift , the English teacher Judy meets up with a producer who is doing a feature on the facial doctor . Joe Montegna plays the producer and he falls for her without her doing anything to her face . Davis shows her adeptness at comedy . In fact , she is even better here at being funny than when the role requires more serious acting . One line I regarded as utter stupidity by Allen . It is when Branagh states that he would do something even if it meant getting terminal cancer . Besides being a horrible thought , this line was totally insensitive to cancer patients . Davis can't believe that she has fallen in so good . In fact , it is she herself who almost ruins things by jilting Joe at the altar . A seer saves the day . By film's end , we see Branagh having nothing in his life other than a few trysts with others who prove themselves to be faithless and dimwitted .
Island in the Sun is Far From Paradise	Disappointing film dealing with life in the Caribbean . The film might have fared better if it had been a musical . The movie marked the re-teaming of Harry Belafonte and the late Dorothy Dandridge from " Carmen Jones " fame 3 years before . Belafonte sings well at the beginning before this film evolves into too many plots , pregnancy , murder , racial tension , politics , etc . The subject matter is totally uneven and the film suffers as a result . Dandridge was never weaker before in any of her brief film career . She evokes little to no emotion and the luster of Carmen , 3 years before , is totally gone . There is entirely too much going on here . James Mason is caught up in a killing , running for political office , and facing the reality that he is partially black . Belafonte loves Joan Fontaine , of all people , but by the end can't marry her due to racial-political considerations on the island . Joan Collins loves Stephen Boyd , he is given so little to do here , but he will be in The House of Lords , so how can she marry him if their children might be black . ( Collins and Mason are brother and sister in this Peyton Place circus-atmosphere . ) To complicate matters still further , old timer Diana Wynyard , an Oscar nominee for 1933's " Cavalcade , " appears in the film as the mother of Collins and Mason . She is effective in the part but the plot twists again when it is revealed that she had Collins from another man . Robert Rossen who directed this mess , did so much better years before with his winning " All the King's Men . " That 1949 Oscar winner for best picture stuck with basically one theme . This one is all over the mull berry bush .
Big Momma's House - Same Old Laughs	The person who does the make-up for Martin Lawrence deserves the Oscar-hands down . In this sequel , Big Momma again goes undercover , this time as a maid to a family that has little time for its 3 children . Seems that daddy , the typical nice guy , has gotten mixed up with enemy agents . The latter want to steal a disk that shows all secret government items . The laughs are there but the jokes are so old and you can easily predict what is going to happen . Lawrence makes all the right moves and the audience shall certainly laugh with his body-motions . The enemy is so predictable ; the kids are cute but their actions are known to the viewer before the next scene arises . Lawrence pulls out a couple of good laughs . Threatening to call the Rev . Al Sharpton , if he doesn't get the job and parking by a synagogue while claiming that Momma is half-Jewish . The reply of the FBI agent is " Shabbat Shalom . " As was in the original , when the bad guys are caught Lawrence can return again as Big Momma to pull the family situations together . While he does a credible job , the viewer should not be prepared for part 3 .
P . S . I Love You-Crying Tomorrow is Not A Romantic Comedy	Somewhat interesting film which was falsely labeled as a romantic comedy . When her seemingly happy marriage ends with the death of her husband , a woman begins receiving letters from him . Of course , you wonder where the letters are being sent from . This is not one of those eerie beyond the graves film . We've come along way from movies since Susan Hayward , as Lillian Roth , reacted to the death of her fiancée by indulging in alcohol . Hilary Swank does a fine impression of Judy Garland's rendition of The Man that Got Away . The part with the fancy shoes from the famous Bette Davis scene of " Now , Voyager " remains a mystery to me . Fine support by Kathy Bates , as her unhappy abandoned mother is given . Sending these letters is the ultimate sacrifice made by a dying beloved husband to get his wife used to her new fate and preparation for a life without him . It's the old adage that life goes on . The film has an interesting concept but is quite depressing . The memorial scene was supposed to be an uplifting scene , but how could it be ?
Thicker Than Water - Your Blood Will Not Exactly Boil Over	Routine movie fanfare where Melissa Gilbert finds out that her late erudite judge father was previously wed to a rodeo queen . The latter let him go because she saw greatness in his future . If she felt like this , why did she marry him to begin with ? Unbeknown to the future , he had a daughter with this woman . She is played by Lindsay Wagner . When Gilbert goes to the ranch to investigate , she soon finds that Wagner is in dispute with the new owner of the range regarding water rights for her horses . In fact , the film begins with the guy shooting at the horses . I was wondering if this was another " They Shoot Horses , Don't they ? " Unfortunately , the true nature of the conflict between them is never revealed . As Gilbert is an attorney , she soon threatens the guy with jail if he doesn't let the horses get their water . Along the way , there is a budding romance between Gilbert and the town vet . Looks like the film is going to the dogs .
Pajama Game-This Norma Rae Musical Just Doesn't Work	While the music and dancing are wonderful , the story is really off the wall . Who could believe that workers want just 7 cents more ? Anyone ever hear about an hourly wage increase ? Ludicrous . This is not one Doris Day's best performances . She needed to more than challenged here . That challenge does not come about from the performance of John Raitt . Yes , their voices are great but the writing does them in . Then there is Reta Shaw . She probably never made it big in Hollywood as there was a Marjorie Main to take the type of parts that Shaw could have done well in . She does an unbelievably good song and dance routine with Eddie Foy Jr . Must Barbara Nichols play the typical factory worker in her usual stupid voice ? Ms . Nichols was far better gifted than what is able to do here . Yes , Carol Haney shines but alas , she is given not that much to do here . Naturally , we're all happy to see that the threatened strike was averted by film's end , but the writing is so amateurish , we might have needed a walkout to make things more interesting .
Citizen Kane-Forever Seeking Rosebud	Perhaps , I am missing something here but what's the big fuss regarding " Citizen Kane ? " A masterpiece , no way ! In 1941 the motion picture academy selected " How Green Was My Valley " as the best picture of the year and this is one person who wholeheartedly agreed with the academy's decision . This movie starring Orson Welles as the fictional Charles Foster Kane was not at all interesting , especially when it was supposedly based on the life of William Randolph Hearst . Had they spoken more about the Hearst Newspapers , his castle in San Francisco , and his affair with Marion Davies , we would have had a far better picture . The picture conveys Kane as an absolute tyrant with a whole host of people around his orbit . Everett Sloane was excellent as Bernstein . The part I liked best was when Kane thought that he would be elected governor and the disappointment that was etched on his face when this did not occur . Rosebud . . .
4 Brothers - Where's the Beef ?	The plot of this potentially excellent movie is short-circuited by the writing . Why did the gang go after Mrs . Mercer like that ? The woman was shot down like an animal . The wonderful Mrs . Mercer , who took in 4 youths that no one ever wanted comes to an end like this . You have to wonder . The four adopted sons reunite and naturally begin to ask questions why this happened . At first , it appeared that old Mrs . Mercer was in the wrong place at the wrong time . Too much starts to come out about corrupt Detroit police , and elected local officials . It just doesn't bother to explain why all this is occurring . The chase scenes , especially the one in the snowstorm was filmed quite well .
Lies And Crimes Shoot Out in Modern Small Doesn't Cut It	Eddie , the cop , takes a bullet in his house and his widowed math teacher moves to the house that he had built . It looks like Ed was a dirty cop and when his widow moves , she finds the small town in filled with people on drugs " borrowing " prescriptions from others . Eddie's friend and fellow cop looks suspicious immediately . It doesn't take long to realize that . It seems as if everyone in the town is corrupt about the rampant use of drugs . " We have no problem here , " says the town constable . Right . When our widow tries to fight with a local drug dealer who she believes knows who killed her husband , there is a shootout and everyone runs . The ending is no surprise to me . I guessed it in the third scene or so . This film is so routine in nature .
Unsuspected - I Suspect Misery Here	Mediocre to average film showcasing the talent of Claude Rains . The latter has never been more bizarre than in this film . In it , he plays a famous raconteur , artist , man of the arts , writer , and nut Grandison . He is better known as Grandy . When Grandy is not airing his chilling stories on the radio , he is killing people . He makes excellent use of the tape recorder so as to record conversations that will later lead to others being blamed . In the meantime , they are already dead . A case in point is his niece played by Audrey Totter . When she guesses that dear old uncle Grandy is a killer , he merely says too bad and pulls out his gun from the drawer and fires . Miss Totter falls dead to the floor . In the meantime , a conversation has been taped with her husband ( Hurd Hatfield ) making it appear that he did her in . Hatfield leaves but Grandy has done something to brakes so you know what's in store for Mr . Dorian Gray . This film is predictable . Rains was a versatile actor and has a field day with the part but the story has been seen and anticipated so many times .
Astronaut Farmer is Lost In Space	Interesting but totally unrealistic film detailing the old idea of fulfilling your dreams . In this case , Billy Bob Thornton wants to go to the moon . No one really believes what Thornton wants to do . When he goes to his child's elementary school , the teacher thanks him for dressing up in his space outfit . Despite the threat of losing his home , Thornton pursues his dream which nearly ends in disaster . Miraculously , he is able to build quite a space station with the most modern of equipment . You may be left with that feel good feeling but the film is so overly unrealistic .
The Out-of-Towners Love N . Y . or Leave it	No getting around it , Jack Lemmon was a fabulous actor and in this film , there is no exception to that statement . His trip to N . Y . along with his wife , played by the late Sandy Dennis , turns into a comedy of errors . Yes , life in the big apple was rough at the time this film was made in 1970 , but everything happening all at once . It's a big exaggerated , don't you think ? The weak link in this film was Miss Dennis . Far better in " Up the Down Staircase , " and other films , she comes across at first as a wife who repeats exactly what her husband tells her to say . As their situation becomes more dire , she attains a degree of independence but her voice is upsetting . We reach the point where we can't wait for their nightmare to end in this city . At least the ending showed that you can't blame everything on N . Y . I wonder how Woody Allen would have handled this type of comedy .
Stone Cold - Great Cold Performance By Tom Selleck But Where's the Beef ?	As the alcoholic top cop in a small Massachusetts town , Tom Selleck gives one of his best performances in years . Having left California and his marriage , Selleck seems to settle in this cold town but a rape and serial killer soon keeps him hopping . We never fully realize why the husband-wife killing team are doing what they're doing . Their characters are not fully developed and when they are not shooting , they are reciting some sort of nonsense or poetry . Even insane people have reasons for going on killing sprees . After 3 killings in the town , the couple kill Selleck's girlfriend because she is too young for them . They claim they want to annoy him . Something is wrong with this kind of dialogue . 3 high school students rape a young girl but this has nothing to do with the serial killings . Maybe , had they tied the rape and the serial killings together , we would have had a better picture . The film ends where I can see a possibility of Selleck doing a weekly show on his character . He is subtle here and delivers a powerful performance in an otherwise flawed production .
Sound of Music Meets Cinderella and Mary Poppins - Wow	A bewitching tale of a widower with seven unruly children . Does this sound familiar ? He can't even keep a governess . No , Julie Andrews doesn't enter into the picture . A magical lady ( Emma Thompson , who also wrote the screenplay ) enters . No , it's not Julie again as " Mary Poppins . " Aunt Adelaide , a memorable Angela Lansbury , has been supporting the brood . She now says that the money will stop if daddy , an engaging Colin Firth , doesn't remarry . When a horrible woman becomes the prospect , the children conspire with Nanny to get rid of her . A Cinderella like ending ensues . This is a g-rated film . Nice to see Imelda Staunton , who played that abortion lady several years ago , in a totally funny role as the cook of the household . Children will enjoy it . You may add an additional if you're young at heart .
We're All Being Held Hostage	A hostage story within another hostage taking situation is what we have here . The film starts off reminding us that even with the best hostage negotiator , dealing in a calm way with a situation , tragedy can result . Three kids , two of them real mental cases , try to hijack a car . The situation soon spins out of control with a police officer dead , and the kids in the home of a widower and his 2 children creating mayhem there with their victims . We soon learn that the father is no angel either . He works for some kind of illegal organization and he has to pass something to them in a disc . The organization soon takes as hostages , the negotiator's daughter and wife . If you can fathom all this , good luck to you . The negotiator , Bruce Willis , does well in the part but the flick soon comes apart , complete with lots of violence . Not for the squeamish . Negotiator Talley ( Willis ) has an assistant in his office , a woman , who reminds us of the late Selma Diamond . She looks like the type living in a rent-controlled building on Kings Highway or Brighton Beach in Brooklyn . Like the rest of this mayhem , she should have retired and spent her days sitting in front of her house with a chair . There has to be two ends to this as there are two hostage situations . The faster they end , the better for all concerned .
My Left Foot Puts It in Its Mouth	Despite the brilliant performance of Daniel Day-Lewis , " My Left Foot " is a very disappointing film . In winning the Oscar , Lewis showed great depth and his mannerisms depicting a frustrated man paralyzed from cerebral palsy was amazing . I can't believe that Brenda Fricker was voted best supporting actress for her role as his devoted mother . Fricker showed absolutely no emotion here . In addition , she looked quite frumpy at the beginning of the film only to become younger looking as the picture went along . Even though he was phenomenal here , there were some parts that it was impossible to understand Day-Lewis . I know that he was talking as a victim of cerebral palsy , but the comprehension remained difficult . This language barrier had an effect with his alleged romance with the woman he ultimately married . Yes , the film is inspirational but it could have been a great deal better .
" Possessed " The Devil Made Her Do It	Poor Joan Crawford . In her 1945 Oscar-winning performance , she was victimized by a wretched daughter . 2 years later Miss Crawford was nominated again for having a stepdaughter-in-law almost get the man that she wanted . ( Van Heflin ) Pity Raymond Massey in this " Possessed " mess . His first wife , a mentally ill woman , commits suicide and Crawford plays the nurse that had taken care of her . She marries Massey on the rebound after being spurned by Heflin . Trouble is that Crawford is a schizophrenic with grand delusions . While the ending is tragic , how can she claim insanity as a defense ? She was overly in love with the Heflin character and was overbearing to put it mildly . Geraldine Brooks has some good moments as the stepdaughter but I generally feel this picture was done to cash in on the success of " Mildred Pierce . " It doesn't work .
The History Boys Make Just That	This is basically another " Boys in the Band " film , 2006 . Period . The exacting is fabulous , especially by Richard Griffiths as a wily professor of literature and Frances de la Tour as the once-married history teacher . We know that there is latent homosexuality as the film progresses . It just becomes a matter of time when it will all come out . Calling this an educational film is nonsensical . In our wildest dreams , no school could ever be like this with such emphasis on critical historical thinking . While the boys prepare for ultimate entrance exams into prestigious British schools , we see talk imitating " Now , Voyager , " and " Brief Encounter . " Come on , this is totally unrealistic . Perhaps , with a different society , this picture could have been much more of a success . Unfortunately , it's dealing with us .
Shock , Schlock Mar Bialystock & Company	An early song in this Mel Brooks romp describing shock , schlock of Max Bialystock really describes the problems in this offensive movie . Yes , offensive it is to all groups . Singing about Hitler and Germany is most obnoxious . Could you imagine Holocaust survivors sitting through this ? Unlike the original film , the song of " Springtime for Hitler " is lengthy and downright insensitive . Nathan Lane reprises the role originally done by the late Zero Mostel . He is engaging but lacks the emotional nerve needed for the role of this conniving human being . Matthew Broderick is Leo Blum , the bookkeeper originally played by Gene Wilder in the film . Broderick's performance is lacking . Though he sings well , his emotional outbursts lack the zany insanity of the Oscar nominated Wilder . There are some added songs and Will Ferrell as the author of " Springtime " is engaging but does not tackle the role as Kenneth Mars did in the original . Perhaps another flop could have made such as a nonsensical musical of Julius Caesar . Dancing to the Ides of March might have yet been hilarious !
Wrestler-Is Much Ado About Nothing As Rourke Looks Like He Has Been through Ringer	Ordinary story of a dejected wrestler who dreams for a comeback . Quite appropriate for Mickey Rourke as he has been out of the limelight for years now . Nonetheless , his performance was really nothing special except that he needed much physical stamina for it . To me , Rachel Evan Wood steals the movie for her fine supporting work as his dejected daughter . If Viola Davis could have been nominated for best supporting actress in " Doubt " for 1 scene , Wood should have been so as well . Marisa Tomei also fares well as the stripper who has mixed feelings about Rourke . Basically a film about 3 unhappy people whose unhappiness spills over to one another . By the way , when bypass surgery occurs it's time to call a halt to wrestling .
Immortal Sergeant Lives On	Henry Fonda looks just like he appeared in 1940's " The Grapes of Wrath . " This is quite a good film detailing several soldiers caught in Africa during World War 11 and how they eventually overcome their perils . Thomas Mitchell , as the old-time sergeant is a standout here . There is able support by Allyn Joslyn , Reginald Gardiner and others . Maureen O'Hara is used mainly in flashbacks here as Fonda thinks back of his past while trying to lead his men to freedom . The ending seems rushed up as Fonda wakes up in the hospital and is told how they got out of their predicament .
Relative Stranger is Beyond Somewhere	This film is essentially Bill Cosby and the Huxtable Family on television in a major conflict . The story would have been far better had it dealt with an impoverished white or black family . Instead , we're dealing with an upper class family whose father abandoned them 6 years ago and has now returned following the death of his father . What are we trying to prove here ? We have heard time and time again from sociologists about the missing father in African-American families and how this hurts their socio-economic status in society . Now , we're given the missing paternal figure with a wealthy family of African-Americans . In addition , someone should tell Cicely Tyson to stop playing Miss Jane Pittman over and over again . All this aside , there are some very good performances by Michael Beach , as the headstrong brother as well as the gentleman in the title role . The two young children convey the idea of a lost father whose presence they need so badly in their lives . While I praise Beach's work , how could the writer coincidentally use the reappearance of the father at the same time that the brother ( Beach ) proposes to his sister-in-law only to learn that she never filed the divorced papers ? That seems very tacky to me .
Poor Ending Spoils Second to Die	Mystery . An engaging , interesting storyline is killed by a ridiculous ending . The story of a beautiful blond who does away with the image of a dumb blond by building a bomb to kill her husband . She had everything until they found out that wife # 1 killed herself and a few days later , their handicapped daughter shows up to live with them . Her husband makes her a maid for this child . Enter the guy's best friend , played by Jerry Kroll , who is a definite look alike to Eddie Fisher . The two plot to kill Jim ( # 1 ) for an insurance policy . Turns out they can't do anything until she dies since the policy can only kick in then and it will be for the surviving child . In the meantime , suspicions are aroused when Kroll weds our blond shortly after Jim's death . The late Paul Winfield plays a widowed detective who is on the trail of the two . Again , the ending is ridiculous as everyone comes together suggesting that everyone was in this for the money . Ridiculous .
No Memorable Memoirs Here	The tale begins in pre-war Japan with two children sent out by their parents . One is accepted into a place where Geishas are . The other is never heard from again . The film has been described as the best backstabbing film since " All About Eve . " How ridiculous that statement is . The latter film had memorable dialogue , the dialogue here is ordinary . Our young heroine is mistreated by a well-known Geisha and the old lady who heads the place . Our story gets going as the girl grows up to become an apprentice-like geisha . She does well and challenges the geisha who had mistreated her years ago . After a major blowup with the latter geisha , World War 11 intervenes and our heroine hides out but is a victim of war deprivation as well . As a young girl , she meets a man who shows her great kindness . This man may very well be her love interest as the film ends . Our heroine is not Gigi and the man is not Louis Jourdan . The end of the war means that Japan , in defeat , will change as they learn to practice capitalism . Our heroine will be needed to get on the good side of the American occupants so as to spur American investment in Japanese industry . As the closing credits appear , I was more than happy to say sayonara to this film .
Dovish on this Hawk	This film was not nearly as good as 1938's Errol Flynn classic - " Robin Hood . " As in the case with " The Sea Hawks , " this film also starred Claude Rains , Una O'Connor and Alan Hale . Rains , brilliant in ' Hood , ' was not given the lines here . While he is again cast in a villain role , he is not given the opportunity to exert evil . O'Connor , who could be counted on to give great comical lines , is muted in this film . Hale is unable to deliver as well . " The Sea Hawks " should be noted for an excellent supporting performance by Flora Robson as Queen Elizabeth . She acts in a majestic style . The film dealing with English piracy , and the Spanish Armada is really dull at best . The escape from slavery was exciting but the picture is about done by then . Brenda Marshall is an engaging leading lady but her part was small and the depth of her acting is not viewed until the end .
Two Girls on Broadway-Only One Really Made It	Lana Turner proved that she could really dance up a storm in this 1940 charmer about the ultimate sacrifice that her sister ( Joan Blondell ) makes for her . When both sisters come to New York , they follow Blondell's beau , a wonderful George Murphy , in this film . As fate would have it , the director of the show is impressed with Turner but sees nothing ahead for Blondell except a job as the cigarette-girl . Not only does Blondell miss stardom , boyfriend , Murphy ( Eddie ) falls for Turner as well . So as not to hurt her sister , Turner is ready to marry the producer of the show , a wealthy womanizer who has wed 4 times . The story concludes as best as possible with Blondell taking a fast exit back to Nebraska . Look for Paul Ford , as a gossip columnist in the film . He is hard to recognize due to the date of the film and the fact that he is much thinner . The film leaves you with the question of whether Ford and Blondell could ever get together . Blondell , as the devoted sister , sacrifices both career and love , for her sister . This film is sentimental and might have worked better if it had been shot in Technicolor . Few realize that George Murphy , the future Republican senator from California , was quite a song and dance man in his day .
Little Women Needs More Maturity	Even Louisa May Alcott would have been disappointed wih this 1949 remake . With her hoarse voice , June Allyson lacks the exuberance of Katharine Hepburn . Elizabeth Taylor is as sour at the beginning as can be . She is almost cruel and as self-centered as they come . Did it make sense to all that while her young sister was dying , she went off to Europe with her maiden aunt , nicely played by Lucile Watson . Watson did an excellent job in reprising the role so memorably created by Edna Mae Oliver in the 1933 original . However , must they have made the trip in order to catch up with Peter Lawford , who had been abandoned by Jo ( Allyson ) ? Janet Leigh , as the sister who married , and " dad " Leon Ames are totally wasted here . Leigh appears but says so little and does anyone realize that when Ayres appeared , the great Civil War must have ended . What happened there ? Rosano Brazzi is way out of his league as the foreign-born professor who brings culture and love into the life of Jo .
Dewey Cox Story Delivers	John C . Reilly does a credible job as a rock singer in this film . This movie is really a take-off on the problems of the 1950s musical singers of the Elvis Presley genre . We see a young marriage falling apart , drug abuse , rising to fame too quickly . Denny is never forgiven by his father due to the tragic death of his younger brother . In addition , the way that it is showed how the mother died some years after that tragedy was rather silly . Falling out of a window with a radio landing on top of her was pretty unbelievable . Reilly , who sang his way to an Oscar nomination in " Chicago , " does sing well here again . The movie is a good one as it shows the importance of family .
Hustle Down the Road	The true feeling of the pool room and the people there are well depicted in " The Hustler . " The first half hour is rather tedious with Minnesota Fats ( Jackie Gleason ) and Fast Eddie ( Paul Newman ) hitting their strides at the pool table . Eddie is ahead by $11 , 000 but throws it all away . The story begins to really take hold and we see further character development when Piper Laurie enters the film . As a drunk , daughter of a rich man who abandoned her , Ms . Laurie showed tremendous depth in a fine performance . Lonely , desperate for love , and a desire to be wanted , she depicted a memorable portrait of desperation . As a vicious hustler himself , George C . Scott turned in a powerhouse performance . How he and Jackie Gleason could have both been nominated for best supporting actor is beyond me . The nomination only belonged to Scott here . Eddie is finally shown as a man who can think about more than pool when tragedy strikes . The film is structured well . We have the pool sequence followed by a body of story development before finally returning to the game itself . Murray Hamilton and Myron McCormick both shine in brief performances , especially McCormick who tries to act in a father role to our hustler hero , but ultimately fails .
27 Dresses Wears Well	Quirky romantic comedy starring Katherine Heigl who helps prepare other women as they walk down the aisle , only to have an inability to land the right guy for herself . She has her eyes on her boss only to lose him to her beautiful sister . She keeps putting off a newspaper writer but of course the two ultimately find love . This is a story of a girl who did everything for her younger sister as their mother died quite young . The sister is selfish and is ultimately revealed at a party for her and her fiancée . The ending is good since it shows how all characters have matured within the year .
Say Good Night to Night People	It seems that someone pulled the plug on 1954's " Night People . " There is a very good plot here about a young American soldier being kidnapped by the Communists in post-World War 11 East Germany . Broderick Crawford , in his usual tough no nonsense portrayals , comes to Berlin to make sure that no one is goofing off on getting his son free as well as to show that his a lot of political ties . What I found interesting here is that the usual gang buster Crawford quiets down and even changes his opinion once he finds out the elements of the entire story . Seems that the East Germans want to exchange his son for an elderly couple , the wife was British and the husband was a German army official , blinded by the Nazis . Appears that the British wife was informing allied intelligence of Nazi activities during the war . Peck is in his usual fine form as someone seeking justice and finding out along the way that his German female assistant is not everything she was cracked up to be . The film needs to have excitement with such a plot but we don't get it at all . Even the drinking of the poison is not shown with any zest at all .
When The Other Woman Was Really Needed	The way this film starts out , you would swear that we're in for murder and mayhem . James Read has divorced Tessa ( Jill Eikenberry ) . The marriage produced 2 children . He has wed Laura Leighton , a young sexy model . Tessa is fuming and you think something is going to happen . Something happens all right . Tessa is diagnosed with terminal cancer and the film depicts the relationship that she builds with Leighton , the latter who shall take care of her children . The film shows the coming of maturity of the Leighton character . She certainly rises to the occasion . The last part of the film falters somewhat as it becomes preachy with the inevitable dialogue . Nevertheless , the performances are quite good , especially those of Eikenberry and Leighton . Lloyd Bridges gives a memorable but brief performance as the father who really never understood Tessa and now has to come to grips with what is occurring .
This Eagle Soars-Jeanne Eagels	Very good film with Kim Novak and Jeff Chandler giving two very good performances . Agnes Moorehead gives fine support as an imperious drama coach who turns into a real human being . The story , well done , is the usual of a woman climbing to fame but allowing it to go to her head with alcoholism and drug addiction occurring . Novak does well in the title role for the first part of the film . It is when success sets in and she begins her outbursts that there is a definite tendency on her part to over-act . She tries to emulate Susan Hayward in " I'll Cry Tomorrow , " and Gloria Swanson in " Sunset Boulevard . " Yes , she is definitely a tragic figure in the vein of a Lillian Roth or Norma Desmond , but she does over reach her bounds . Look for a brief but wonderful performance by Virginia Grey , who is duped by Eagels and commits suicide . Chandler is excellent in the role of the man she really loved , but never married because marriage would have destroyed them .
Those Guns , those Guys , that Gal	" Gunsmoke " was an amazing show because the cast was like one big happy family . Marshall Dillon epitomized what decency meant to us . A fair and compassionate man , Dillon knew what he was up against when the dregs of society rode into town . We had Festus , with his memorable limp and Amanda Blake's Miss Kitty , a dance hall queen , with a heart of gold . Too bad that she was never able to get her man , Matt Dillon , lord knows how much she loved him and he loved her . Where were the script writers to produce the inevitable wedding between the two ? Milburn Stone made his mark playing Doc . He fixed up many a bullet-ridden victim but also had a pure heart . This was basically a story of very decent human beings who were caught up in the founding of the west .
Black Fury - Incisive Labor Film	The fabulous Paul Muni gives another wonderful performance in this 1935 film . With a genuine Slavic accent , Muni is superb as a coal miner who loses his girl ( Karen Morley ) to a company Policeman and goes on a drinking binge as a result . It is at this point that a gangster organization tries to create chaos within the union and Muni becomes their perfect foil . J . Carrol Naish is excellent as the worker who works for this unholy organization . Naturally , Muni's best friend is killed in a clash with company police and Muni , now sober , vows revenge . Morley returns to Muni just in time as he goes down into the mine and starts blowing the place up . It's at this point that the film starts to go down , but with Muni's performance and the problems shown of what the coal miners had to endure plus the dishonesty in trying to break the union , all make for a very good film .
Lady is Willing and So Should You in Seeing this Film	Wonderful 1942 film with Marlene Dietrich as a Broadway star who finds a baby and marries a pediatrician so that she can keep the baby . Of course , the story deals with them finding their way to love eventually as well as the situations they encounter such as phony parents showing up to take the child , and the doctor's first wife showing up to create further havoc . Fred MacMurray is absolutely charming as the doctor and Dietrich showed how quite adept she was at comedy . Aline MacMahon co-stars as a wise-cracking assistant to Dietrich . This kind of role was normally assigned to Eve Arden . Naturally , there is the end-of-film crisis where MacMurray has to operate and Dietrich sheds those tears . It's well worth it .
Love is Even Better than 4 Letters Here	A very satisfying comedy film featuring a girl and guy who meet at the wedding of their best friends . They are truly a perfect match for each other until they walk into court as divorce attorneys handling the opposite side of a divorce case . The film deals with how their handling of the case affects their relationships . This is basically a story of love , conflict , divorce and redemption . This is told along a backdrop of the true California beach scene . The couple who is divorcing after 30 years are being described as a retirement divorce . You hear so much of the husband retiring and the marriage faltering as he is around more often now at the home . This was a very interesting plot and is well resolved by film's end .
Of Human Bondage-The Third Time Around Merits	Kim Novak surprised me here . While she certainly was no Bette Davis , she ably tackled the role of Mildred Rogers . To me , Mildred , that British waitress with the ability to hurt people beyond belief , was still best served by Davis's marvelous 1934 performance . That's not to take anything away from Miss Novak . Nonetheless , the vulnerability of Mildred does not come across here . As for Laurence Harvey , he comes across to me in the opposite way that Leslie Howard played Philip in the 1934 version . Howard was much more subordinate to Mildred , just standing there with her violent outbursts . Harvey is able to match Novak and come back at her severely . Laurence Harvey did do an admirable job in the role of a man who seemed to be destined to fail at anything despite the fact that he did become a doctor . Kudos for Robert Morley who portrays a nasty medical instructor . He really knows how to put the prospective doctors down . Had he been more attractive , he could have handled Mildred Rogers . I was pleasantly surprised by this 1964 version of the W . Somerset Maugham's classic . However , while we shouldn't compare , it is still not in the league of the Bette Davis , Leslie Howard original . We should note that this 1964 film has a marvelous musical score .
Breach - What A Compromise !	Chris Cooper is very good as spy Robert Hanssen who caused so much damage with his espionage dealings from 1985 . Cooper conveys the mood of a religious obsessed person , who is autocratic , surly and just downright nasty to his subordinates . Who would ever guess that he was passing to the Soviets so much information ? Ryan Philippe is definitely an up and coming actor . Sent in by the bureau to investigate Hanssen , he immediately comes across as a nervous , incompetent person . Hanssen finally comes to realize that Officer O'Neill is not as foolish as he makes himself out to be . Laura Linney , a bureau head , does a very good job in conveying what is going on and what she is doing to destroy Hanssen . This true story was handles adeptly by Hollywood .
Traitor is Good Treason	Don Cheadle turns in another great acting performance . As a soldier of fortune in Afghanistan , who allegedly becomes a Moslem fanatic and throws himself in with Moslem terrorists , Cheadle etches a very interesting character . The truth be told , Cheadle is nothing more than a government operative living the life of a double agent . It is such a secret regarding his true beliefs that not even the CIA knows that he is really a good guy . For a change of pace , Jeff Daniels appears in a good film although his part is too brief . He is the agent who consoles Cheadle when a bomb that Cheadle has detonated killing 8 people only to fall victim to a bullet fired by Don to show the terrorists that he is one of them . The picture is fast paced and nicely done . The ending will make you smile .
Shall We Dance Has the Right Step	This 1937 again shows Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire in rare form . This time is Fred is a Russian named ballet dancer who falls for fellow dancer Rogers . He tells his aide , the ever adorable Edward Everett Horton , to get rid of a woman who is pursuing him . To do this , Horton tells the woman that Fred and Ginger are wed and the fun really begins . With gossip from the hotel staff , reporters and shipmates on board , word is soon out that Ginger is pregnant . To keep her from leaving their business relationship , Jerome Cowan adds to the mayhem to state that they really are married . Ginger feels that the only way to end all this is to get married and then quickly file for divorce . Love seems to blossom until that old pest girlfriend shows up and Ginger blows her top . How this resolves itself via dance is so entertaining to view .
He Walked By Night	Good film , but was Roy really into that led him into becoming a cop killer ? This is really never fully explained here . Yet , this is a very good film because it shows that by good detective work , the guilty can be found out . While Richard Basehart doesn't say that much in the film , his actions certainly speak for himself . There is wonderful acting by head cop , Roy Roberts , who did so well in bigoted roles in " Gentleman's Agreement , " and " Hotel as well as Scott Brody . The ending in the tunnel of L . A . is well done as Basehart meets his end . Whit Bissell is excellent in a supporting role of a businessman who buys Roy's stolen electrical goods and is then recruited by the police to turn him in .
Ivanhoe-Bring on the Anglo-Saxons and Normans	" Ivanhoe , " filmed in bright techicolor was nominated for best picture in 1952 . Miklos Rosza again provides us with a major musical score . I always felt that his scores , so rich in textures , would be a prelude to his Oscar-winning score in " Ben-Hur . " ( 1959 ) The film deals with the ongoing fight between the Anglo-Saxons and Normans , the latter having ruled England since the infamous Battle of Hastings in 1066 . While fighting in the crusades , Richard the Lionhearted has been kidnapped and held captive in Austria . This has been done with the help of the Austrian emperor Leopold and Prince John , Richard's evil brother , who assumes the throne in his brother's absence . I laughed at the beginning of the film when Robert Taylor , who plays Ivanhoe , loyal to Richard , asks someone for a translation as he doesn't read Austrian . Didn't they mean German ? While it is true that Germany did not become a unified country until 1871 following the Franco-Prussian war , the dialect spoken in the entire region was German . Taylor rallies to the aid of his people . Hurt , he is given refuge by the Jewess Rebecca , played with warmth and skill by Elizabeth Taylor . Her father , Isaac the Jew , played by the always serious Felix Aylmer , promises to help pay the ransom for Richard so that his people can have religious toleration in England . Naturally , Rebecca loves Ivanhoe but so does Lady Rowena played by a much reserved Joan Fontaine . Her guardian , the father of Ivanhoe in the film , is portrayed by Finlay Currie , who played in numerous bible films . The Technicolor and cinematography are breathtaking in the film . A story of love and devotion , especially that of George Sanders , who sacrifices all for Rebecca .
Diplomatic Courier-Cloak & Dagger At its Best	Wonderful Tyrone Power vehicle that will have you guessing every minute along the way . When Power is assigned to deliver important papers , the person who is to receive them can't retrieve them and is eventually murdered . Suspicion centers on Hildegarde Knef , who does quite well in this film . Patricia Neal is in fine form as a wealthy looking widow of an official who comes along and tries to romance Power along the way . What else is this conniving woman up to ? Diplomatic intrigue hasn't been this good in years . Power is sympathetic and will rescue Neff at the end when it appears that she has been truthful to him throughout the film .
Call Me Great ! Ethel Shines As Ambassador	Ethel Merman certainly proved her comedic gifts in this 1953 gem of a musical . Loosely based on Pearl Mesta , " Call Me Madam " deals with a female ambassador to an imaginary kingdom . Merman pulls out all the stops in blasting away such nostalgic music . She certainly was the hostess with the most . What makes the film so good is that she is ably supported by a great cast including Donald O'Connor , who played her bad boy son in " There's No Business Like Show Business . " In this film he portrays a reporter who finds romance while assigned to her . He is with the wonderful , charming Vera-Ellen . George Sanders , with a thick European accent , shines here as a count . He gets away from the usual cads that he played in films . Billy de Woolf is his usual irritating but wonderful self here .
Step Up and View this	With a cast of relative unknowns , with the exception of former Oscar nominee Rachel Griffiths , this film , dealing with youngsters at a school for dramatic arts , is absolutely marvelous . It's basically the story of changing one's environment so as to get the best out of what life offers . When our hero is involved in school vandalism , he is sentenced to 200 community hours of service at the school where he did the damage . There , he falls in with a different crowd of youngsters . Our protagonist comes from a dysfunctional foster home where the father drinks beer all day . His two African American friends are two guys into prank making . Unfortunately , the younger brother , is afraid of nothing and he will meet a tragic ending . Again , he could not get out of his environment . At the school , Tyler , who can dance up a storm , naturally falls for her a girl who needs a dance partner when her partner is hurt . This part of the story is highly predictable but the dancing is great and the youngsters put on great performances .
Whatever Happened to Aunt Alice ? Pure Fun for the Rest of Us	A definite film of the macabre again proving that there was no one like Geraldine Page for these neurotic , vicious parts . In this one , Ruth Gordon takes a job as a maid in Page's home under false pretenses . It seems that Gordon had a disagreement with her long time domestic , played by Mildred Dunnock . In a huff , Dunnock walked out and went to work for Page . Seems that Page has quite a history . Once she finds out that her maids have no family , she does them in quite neatly . Throughout the film you constantly are hearing Page yelling Mrs . Dimmock to maid Gordon , as she begins to suspect that Gordon is no usual maid . The film takes place in the desert of Arizona which seems to place a peculiar and effective aura to the film . The ending is an absolute knockout .
Like Mother , Like Daughter - This Anthropologist Makes Some Dig	Very much of a thrilling movie with William R . Moses once again proving that he has left the role of Ken Melansky completely from his Perry Mason days and has now become quite a killer in mid-age . This time he portrays an anthropology professor who apparently with his good looks likes to pursue young female students . Trouble is that he is also off the wall and his dark side can lead to tragedy . He does an excellent job in framing the dead student's ex-boyfriend , who by the way he kills as well . It's interesting how the dead girl's mother finds out through good detective work what is really going on . A really good film with intensity and good acting all the way .
The Garment Jungle is a Dressy Film	Terrific film in the genre of " On the Waterfront . " This one involves efforts to unionize the dress industry and the violence by mobsters hired by bosses to thwart the unions from getting a hold on the workers . Lee J . Cobb is perfect as the role of the garment boss who has paid for years to keep the union out of his business . When his partner is murdered by gangsters when the former is willing to sign on with the union , this occurs just in time as Cobb's son , well played by Kerwin Matthews , arrives from Europe on the scene and is willing to learn the business . He soon realizes why his father has kept him out and when an organizer for the union is murdered , he becomes totally sympathetic with the union movement as well as the widow ( Gia Scala ) of the slain organizer . The picture captures the woes of garment workers and the mobsters who were hired to keep them out . It is to be noted that the garment industry always had a history of difficulty with labor . Many of these places were in violation of National Labor Board rules and were continuously fined for abusing workers . This is a picture of rare quality with solid acting performances by a terrific cast . The film should especially be viewed by all the anti-union activists out there .
This Movie Hits A High ( The ) Note	Despite a far-fetched coincidence at the end , " The Note " is a wonderful movie . It made me think of the 1952 film , " Phone Call from A Stranger . " Again , we're dealing with the after effects of a plane crash . In this film , a reporter retrieves a note left behind from the passenger and tries to determine who the note was intended for . There are 3 possibilities . While each does not pan out , the note has a definite affect on each of the possible recipients - a pastor , a country western singer and the son of a real estate mogul . The last 2 mentioned had falling outs with their parents . The note shows the importance of strong family relationships and the ties that bind . It is also shown that the note could be used for devious means as in the case with the son of the real estate millionaire . With the spirit of the season , this is a timely , well-crafted film . Genie Francis delivers an interesting performance as the reporter . While she searches out the recipient of the note , we see flash-backs of her tragic life revealed . The ending , while too coincidental , comes with the spirit of the season so I will have to forgive the writers . This is still a memorable film and is well worth watching .
Trouble With Angels - All Trouble Should Be Like this	The film was directed by Ida Lupino and what a perfect vehicle for her . Lupino did a fine job in directing this film because she herself was a rebel in every which way of the film industry . What makes the film so good is the fine performances by Rosalind Russell and Hayley Mills and the wonderful surprise ending which I shall not reveal . The film starts off basically about 2 girl brats who are attending an all-girl Catholic school . Russell , as Mother Superior , comes off as cold and tough , but in reality , she has a heart of gold . One flaw I found was where Russell spoke of her personal life before the convent to Mills . Once a person enters the convent , they are supposed to " forget " about the past . Never really losing faith in the girls despite the havoc they cause , we really don't see where the film is going until the surprise ending which is quite poignant . The film goes from comedy to the telling of a nun who was tortured by the Nazis for hiding 34 Jewish children in Munich . You might begin to sense the surprise by viewing one of the girls in action at a nursing home for seniors . The film almost reminds me of another variation of " Going My Way , " and its sequel " The Bells of St . Mary's . " " Come to the Stable " also comes to mind . Well worth seeing .
The Life of David Gale-Capital Punishment Debate with A New Twist	Kevin Spacey turned in another excellent performance as a Ph . D college philosophy professor whose sexual escapade , while his wife is away , invariably leads to his downfall . Laura Linney does well as the dying member of the philosophy department . Both she and Spacey belong to an organization committed to being against the death penalty . When Spacey is condemned to death for killing Linney , he asks that a reporter , Kate Winslet in an excellent performance , interview him . Winslet determines that Spacey is innocent but has little time to prove it . The clock ticks away as Spacey , on death row , sees his appeals denied even up to the Supreme Court . The ending is a surprise and is further shocking when it's revealed that Spacey wasn't as innocent as he was made out to be , in a plot where Linney killed herself and wanted Spacey to be convicted and then it be revealed that she was a suicide . Trouble was that another cohort decided to take it further and sacrifice Spacey . The debate of capital punishment shall always be ongoing . What makes this film so good is the unusual twist we see at the end . May we say that people are just dying to end capital punishment .
Where Did Love Go ?	Danny has some very serious emotional hangups . Seems that she plunged a knife into her mom's boyfriend . Was it to save her mother ? Was it out of a jealous rage ? With a film starring Bette Davis and Susan Hayward , you know that the fireworks are there and they sure are . Nevertheless , they are well matched by a terrific performance by Joey Heatherton as the disturbed teenager . What happened to Heatherton after this film ? She was a fine dramatic actress with great potential . Davis is her usual overbearing mother and has created lots of turmoil for the seriously emotionally unstable Hayward . Both are like sticks of dynamite in the scenes that they appear opposite each other . ( In her autobiography Davis lashed out at Hayward stating that she said her lines and would immediately leave the set at the end of the scene . ) In a strong supporting performance , Anne Seymour plays the psychiatrist who tries to help the young Danny . Remember Seymour ? Usually a grade-B actress , she gave a fine supporting performance as Broderick Crawford's faithful but neglected wife , Lucy , in the 1949 Oscar winner " All the King's Men . " An emotionally charged film that brings out all the stops . Mike Connors costars as Hayward's ex . An ultimate crowd pleaser due to the fine acting of Davis and Hayward . A downer at the end but still worthwhile seeing .
Follow Me Boys Tribute to the Boy Scouts	Wonderful Fred MacMurray fanfare dealing with a man who settles in a small rural town in 1930 and in order to impress Vi , ( Vera Miles ) he embarks on a career as the scoutmaster of the town . Little does he know that this will become a lifetime position for him as he guides countless numbers of boys to maturity through 20 years of scouting . The film is an excellent tribute to the Boy Scouts of America . Vera Miles plays the girl he eventually marries . The film deals with the trials and tribulations that he has deal with during his 20 years of work . Lillian Gish is in fine form as Aunt Hetty , who seems to be senile but is anything but . Elliott Reid , her nephew , comes off as the villain here , partly because he had lost Miles to Lem ( MacMurray ) years before . Kurt Russell is absolutely terrific as a difficult youngster who loves his alcoholic father but is embarrassed by him . Russell goes to live with Lem and Vi when the father dies . Heartwarming and poignant , this is really Americana at its best .
Alex's Memorable Ragtime -	What a wonderful musical for Tyrone Power , age 24 , to appear in 1938 . When fate brings Miss Kirby to the band , the 3 become instant pals . The 3 being Don Ameche , Power and the wonderful Alice Faye . Faye gives by far her best performance in pictures . At the beginning , she shows depth in playing a loud mouth common person in the way of Stella Dallas . She matures beautifully as the film develops . Fate also intervenes when Stella Kirby is offered a role on Broadway , but she must leave the band . Power is bitter , but it's just in time for World War 1 and he goes into the army . Upon his discharge , he learns that Charlie ( Ameche ) has married Stella . While the marriage doesn't last , Power has made a name for himself with the band and Stella discovers that he has a new love interest in his life - Ethel Merman . While Merman has the voice , she is not exactly the other woman type in films . She sings her songs in timely fashion but she doesn't belt them out as she would do years later . How Alexander ( Power ) and Stella come back to each other is the rest of the movie . Done with lovely musical fanfare , " Alexander's Ragtime Band " must rate as one of the best musicals that Hollywood ever turned out .
Miracle at Midnight-A Rosh Hashanah in Denmark to Remember	Outstanding film reliving the events of Rosh Hashanah , 1943 in Denmark . After occupying the country for 3 years , the Nazis chose the solemn Rosh Hashanah holiday to arrest people . The film showed the courage of the Danish people in hiding the Jews on that fateful night . There had always been a strong feeling of toleration towards all groups in Denmark unlike the other European countries . Did not the king of Denmark wear the obligatory Yellow Badge when all Danish Jews were required to do so ? Sam Waterston and Mia Farrow are excellent as the surgeon and his wife , both of whom aid in the rescue attempt . This is a fine film detailing the human spirit . Anne Frank would have been so proud of the actions of the Danes as she so ardently believed that all people are basically good .
Grumpy Old Men We Need More Grumps Like this	Wonderful film pairing the great Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon as feuding neighbors who really both have so much in common . The feud intensifies with the coming of widowed neighbor-Ann Margret to the neighborhood . Both our old friends go after her . Daryl Hannah is along for the ride . As Lemmon's separated from her husband's father , she portrays an interesting character . Along for the laughs in Lemmon's father , portrayed with great wit by Burgess Meredith . Naturally , we have the crisis situation that brings the two elderly gentlemen together . If you think you're in for a funeral at the end , guess again . It's a great ending to an endearing film . Matthau and Lemmon had such great on screen chemistry together . This film is no exception .
Sacrifices Will Tug at Your Heart	Excellent film with Melissa Gilbert giving a wonderful performance as a young girl , a successful lawyer , who returns to her father's farm , when her brother informs her that there is something wrong with her father . When she returns , she is confronted with her past-finding her mother dead from carbon monoxide poisoning . The film nicely attempts to deal with the adverse affects of depression . I was surprised that the brother was startled to hear the diagnosis of the father's problem as Alzheimer's since the movie did a very good job of showing the usual symptoms associated with the illness . The Gilbert character is called away from a case where a young girl abandoned her baby . Gilbert immediately suspects incest upon the stepfather with the girl , but the latter refuses to open up . Tragic consequences follow this part of the story . Ken Howard gives an excellent supporting performance as the stricken father , but the entire cast is excellent , especially Gilbert's brother , the girl who was raped , as well as her mother . An excellent film dealing with human relations and the power of forgiveness .
This Mame is Still My Kind of Dame	Lucille Ball gets better and better as this film goes on . Still , it would have been nice to have the fabulous Bea Arthur in the title role . Lucy is effective in the title role but her voice was not good at the film's beginning . However , as was the case with the rest of her performance , that improved as well . Don Porter and Audrey Christie as the bigoted parents of nephew Patrick's girlfriend are hilarious . Also , hilarious is the way that Lucy fixes them . How can we criticize Ball ? Lucy is Lucy . Maybe , if we made Desi Arnaz , a Spanish Beauregard Burnside , the film would have been even better . However , that's unfair to Robert Preston who does well in the Burnside part . Lucy is at her best when she confronts a grownup Patrick ( nicely played by later Oscar nominee for " Longtime Companion's , " Bruce Davidson ) about his affair with that snobby girl . When she sings " He Walked into My Life , " your heart will flutter . Bea Arthur is magnificent as friend and rival Agnes Gooch . When she tells Mame to get your ass on the moon , you'll breakup from laughter . People were disappointed with " Mame . " I wasn't .
Leave Her to Heaven - You Can't Leave this One	Gene Tierney , as a fiery woman , driven absolutely mad by jealousy . The latter leads her to tragedy beyond the human realm of comprehension . Cornel Wilde plays the man who loved her dearly and suffered for her actions . Vincent Price is in top form as the prosecuting attorney at her trial . A terrific performance by Tierney who received a well-deserved Oscar nomination . Apparently , it was her misfortune to run against Joan Crawford that particular year for " Mildred Pierce . " The voting here between the two must have been tight at best . The film has excellent cinematography with vivid images left in the minds of the viewers .
We Own the Night A Wonderful Possession	The best roles that Joaquin Phoenix and Robert Duvall have had in years . They along with Mark Wahlberg show their mettle in this memorable film . While the theme may be cliché , a wayward brother from a police family , goes on the right side when his commissioner father is killed and officer brother is shot by drug dealers he has been with , the film is so well done that you just don't mind this . Phoenix captures the part of the renegade brother to a tee and Wahlberg is in fine form as the officer-brother . Duvall is just terrific as the no nonsense father who meets such an untimely end . The visual shots of a crime ridden Brooklyn are well stated . Even , then Mayor Koch appears in this film . A totally memorable experience .
This Princess is A Real Gem Princess O'Rourker	Olivia de Havilland shows once again that she can play a quiet , timid young lady as she had done 4 years earlier in the epic " Gone With the Wind . " Cast opposite a wonderful Robert Cummings , as Eddie O'Rourke , the two provide an absolute great chemistry between them in this wonderful film . My only surprise here is that Gladys Cooper , as a secretary , has so little to do here . As always , Charles Coburn is terrific , especially by showing his comic and dramatic abilities in films . The scene where he tells Eddie to get out is just great . The picture just proves over and over that wealth and status can't bring you happiness . The odd-ball meeting between the Princess and Eddie provides for so much fun here . Rounding out the cast is Jane Wyman and Jack Carson , as the married friends of Eddie . The scene where Mary ( Olivia ) is willing to do anything for the war effort was quite humorous . She is better than any princess , the woman is no snob . Eddie shows his mettle when he refuses to give up his American citizenship by marrying a foreign princess . He wishes to do his patriotic duty , the great theme for American films during World War 11 .
" Summertime " Seasonly Good	The adventures of an American spinster schoolteacher , in Italy on summer vacation , make for a wonderful Oscar nominated vehicle for Katharine Hepburn . Meeting handsome Rossano Brazzi brings delight to our heroine . Her dip in the pool and her purchasing of a goblet make for an enjoying film . Of course , along the way , Hepburn finds romance , which is tempered by the fact that Brazzi is married . Katharine Hepburn once again showed her comedic gifts as an actress . We hadn't seen that since the late 1930s with her screw-ball comedies such as " Bringing Up Baby " with Cary Grant . All summer vacations have to come to an end . Brazzi just about misses the train that sends her off . Of course , he catches up to her as the train is pulling out . Will they renew their friendship ? After all , there is always next summer . Now , we know how spinster schoolteachers felt every September when the school bells chimed for another year . Those warm summer days harkened them back to those summer romances and escapades in Europe . A great film for the romantically inclined .
Goldfinger - A Golden James Bond Film	A very good film based on the Ian Fleming character . Wonderful to read that it has been brought out that Gert Frobe , who played Goldfinger , used his membership in the Nazi Party to help Jews escape from Germany . It is said that a Jewish family came forward to thank him . If this is true , he should be considered by Yad Vashem as a righteous person . The film is filled with action and still holds strong after 45 years . Sean Connery's delivery of certain lines is wonderfully sarcastic . Those lines after people get electrocuted would bring a chuckle to anyone . Shirley Bassey's rendition of the title song is marvelously staged . Amazing that this song did not win the Oscar for best song . Hard to believe that Honor Blackman , who portrayed Pussy Galore , will be 82 in December . Are we all getting older ?
Susan Cuts No Slack in Susan Slade	By the early 1960s Hollywood was handling unwed pregnancies differently than they had done in the 1940s or even earlier . This film is no exception to that rule . Connie Stevens does a remarkable job in the film acting as churlish , and a totally obedient , young naive daughter to Lloyd Nolan and Dorothy McGuire in the film . Does she mature when she becomes pregnant and the child's father dies in a fall while mountain climbing . While Susan Hayward had nothing to fall back on other than marriage when she befell the same fate in " My Foolish Heart , " Stevens comes from an affluent family who flee to Guatemala where she gives birth and mom McGuire assumes the role of the baby's mother . Naturally , we have further sadness with the death of Nolan , from a heart condition that he kept from the family for years . There is ample support from friends Brian Aherne and Natalie Shafer , the latter always the wealthy high class matron , assumes a much more comforting and understanding role here . The real gem here other than Stevens is the performance by Troy Donahue , whose father embezzled from Aherne and hung himself in jail . Naturally , Donahue is to bear the stigma of being his father's son . Of course , love blossoms between him and Stevens . Aherne and Shafer have their young son , Burt Convy , as a love interest . The film is a good one due to story-line and the love of 2 people , both of whom society could have deemed as losers , if it weren't for the fate they shared together .
Les Miserables Not At all Miserable	Phenomenal remake of the Fred March-Charles Laughton classic dealing with a relentless officer's pursuit of a decent man whose sole crime was the stealing of a loaf of bread . The film depicts the conditions in France that would lead to this type of behavior . Excellent performances by Liam Neeson as the victimized Jean Valjean and Geoffrey Rush as the evil inspector made so famous by Laughton in the 1930s . This is a tale dealing with hate caught up in the pursuit of following the law in every detail . It brings forth the 1848 uprising in Paris and in a near tragic coincidental way , brings the inspector back to pursuing Valjean after a 10 year absence . The Paris uprising was never more valiant and the players are true to their form in revolutionary France . A film not to be missed . How come that Neeson doesn't really age as nearly 20 years goes by ?
Very Good Remake of ' 27 Classic	By 1952 Hollywood decided to remake the Al Jolson first-talking classic . This time the Cantor's son was played by Danny Thomas . Coming home from the army , it is expected that he follow in the footsteps of his father and other male relatives by becoming a cantor . However , young Mr . Golding has quite a zest for show business . At this time , he meets Peggy Lee , an aspiring singer . She acts very well and her rendition of her favorite song , Lover , is remarkable . The film writers were smart not to plug the obvious Jewish guy and non-Jewish girlfriend relationship . If anything , this is glossed over . In his anger , for betraying his pledge to become a cantor , his father makes the traditional Jewish sign indicative of a loss in the family . This would not be done under circumstances of breaking a pledge , it would be done if among the orthodox , an inter-faith marriage would take place . Thomas does a really good job of playing the cantor's son . His singing is up to par as the film ends on a positive note . Am surprised that technical advisers did not realize that women do not carry pocketbooks into synagogue on the sabbath or at all during that period .
This Crime Film Pays to Be Seen-Find Me Guilty	Surprisingly excellent film dealing with a large number of mobsters on trial for racketeering . What appeared to be a comedy in the first scene , turns serious and is done well by a cast led by Vin Diesel . Diesel is superb as a mobster with a 6th grade education who defends himself . Slowly but surely in a trial that lasted nearly 2 years , Diesel and others are able to make the government's case against them appear quite weak . Diesel effectively uses personal matters to his advantage to turn the tables on the prosecuting attorney . Diesel is supported by a fabulous supporting cast led by Alex Rocco , Ron Silver and others . Worthwhile to see especially for the human element it presents . This may be contrived but is effective movie-making .
" Guilty By Suspicion " Is True to Form	Robert DeNiro will not give names to the House UnAmerican Activities committee . There goes his Hollywood career . His marriage to Ruth , Annette Bening , has already ended in divorce , so why not the rest of his life down the drain as well ? The film is very similar in nature to Woody Allen's " The Front " of the 1970s . If you've seen the latter , you know what the ending shall be . It's called principles above all . Patricia Wettig gives a fine supporting performance as an actress turned in by her own husband with tragedy resulting . Nice to see Martin Scorsese go in front of the cameras for this film . He is fleeing to England to escape testifying . We get a wonderful sense of the 1950s in Hollywood . Marilyn Monroe is hot and so is this film .
" Birdman of Alcatraz " Beyond Anything for the Birds	Despite the fact that the real Robert Stroud was depicted as someone who had been rehabilitated but really had not been , the film was nonetheless an excellent story very well acted by all . Burt Lancaster did it again . Two years after winning the Oscar for " Elmer Gantry , " his strong performance in " Birdman " brought him still another nomination . The film is devoted basically into 3 parts , why Stroud was in jail , his work with birds and his attempt to reform prison life . It is true that Stroud became an expert on bird diseases during his long incarceration . Besides Lancaster , we have very strong performances by Telly Savalas , receiving a supporting nomination as a psychopathic inmate who develops an interest in birds as well , and Thelma Ritter , in her 6th and final Oscar nomination , as Robert's mother , who petitioned to President Wilson to save him from the gallows only to completely break with him years later when he married a woman while in prison . He had to his mother's full attention or none . Karl Malden is perfect as the warden who cried out for justice years after Stroud had killed a guard in prison . He was relentless and made sure that Stroud was transferred to The Big Rock . Betty Field is convincing as the woman who brought happiness into Stroud's life after reading about his success with birds . In a heartbreaking scene , Stroud realizes that he will never be pardoned and tells Stella ( Betty ) to leave him . The film is definitely one of social significance and is to be rated as excellent despite the fact that Robert Stroud did not possess a human side as depicted in the film .
" Pride of the Yankees " Hits Memorable Home Run	Superior biography of Lou Gehrig who had everything before ALS paid him a visit . Gary Cooper is terrific as Gehrig . He was the embodiment of a plain , aw shucks guy who made it big in baseball . Teresa Wright had the right flavor as Eleanor , his loving wife . There are fine supporting performances by Elsa Janssen and Ludwig Stossel as his parents . The film is great because it shows a warm , loving family , poor financially but rich in spirit . Rather than concentrate on all his baseball achievements , the film deals with Gehrig , the man and what a great , kindly gentleman that he was . Walter Brennan , who made so many films with Cooper , appears again this time as a sports writer . He befriends him and becomes a close family friend . Dan Duryea , as a cynical reporter , is quite effective in a small role . He seems to have it in for Lou but succumbs like everyone else during that famous farewell speech . What also made this film a classic was the use of Babe Ruth and other Yankees play themselves . Had the Babe lived , he could have been in films . A definite film detailing the human spirit . When Gehrig meets the boy that he had " hit 2 home runs " for years later , your heart will go out . That scene , along with the farewell speech , was poignant .
An American for All Ages-Knute Shines	Pat O'Brien had his best role ever as Notre Dame football coach Knute Rockne . From humble beginnings , Rockne entered Notre Dame as a student circa 1910 . He is into chemistry but becomes a marvelous football player and hero . Upon graduation , he teaches chemistry at the school but he has got the football fever that tugs at him , this forces him to give up chemistry to pursue his dream of coaching the game . In a way , too bad , the school probably lost a great chemistry teacher-certainly far better and nicer than the one I had in high school . ( Erasmus Hall in Brooklyn to be exact . ) He motivates his students . He will not tolerate academic underachievement . He is a coach for all seasons . O'Brien captures that common kind touch . One of his students , George Gipp , is memorably played in a fine brief supporting performance by Ronald Reagan . The years pass and the achievements run high-but Knute remains the same kind coach who testifies before Congress when football is called into question . Donald Crisp is outstanding as a Notre Dame priest who knew that Rockne was destined to coach football . Albert Basserman is adequate , but his Jewish accent in the portrayal of a priest is awkward at best . Basserman was nominated that year in the supporting category for " Foreign Correspondent . " Rockne's tragic death , in a plane crash , robbed the world of many more years of a totally professionally wonderful human-being . The film is great .
Sweet Home Alabama - Bring on the Sweets	I loved this film showing the cultural differences between New Yorkers Patrick Dempsey and his mayor mother Candice Bergen as opposed to southerners Reese Witherspoon and her estranged husband Josh Lucas . Fed up with her life down south , Witherspoon leaves for N . Y . and embarks on a career in fashion . She meets up with Dempsey and goes back home to get her divorce papers signed by Lucas so that she can marry the mayor's son . When returning to the south , she immediately takes on that southern charm and you know that she will redefine her relationship with Lucas . The hilarious ending makes you feel good about yourself . This is one of Reese Witherspoon's best .
Sinatra : You Will Be My Music-What Class	Highest rating to this Frank Sinatra special . Frank was 57 when he made this show in 1973 . Guest star was his often movie co-star , Gene Kelly , who at 61 , could still hoof it when it came to dancing . His display of it with Sinatra were great . Sinatra came out of retirement to do this show . After viewing it , you have to wonder why he retired to begin with . He first sings " You Will Be My Music " which essentially becomes the theme of the show . Frank was never better when it came to one liners explaining that a telephone operator didn't know who he was , couldn't spell his name and hung up on him when he sang . His rendition of Send in the Clowns was phenomenal . Nice to have seen Lucille Ball and Sammy Davis Jr . in the audience cheering The Chairman of the Board on . They had plenty to cheer about .
You're in for the Ride of Your Life	An all-star cast breathes life into this 1970 Oscar nominated film for best picture . What is going on at the airport ? Burt Lancaster is the airport manager and he even can't get everything under control . Pilot Dean Martin loves one of the stewardesses . His cold wife is no help either . We will soon discover that the stewardess is with child . We have the elderly Ada Quonsett , whose late husband knew all the angles , as a geometry teacher . Ada loves planes but not to pay as a passenger . She is a constant stowaway . It is her ability to be a stowaway that shall add so much to the plot . If this isn't enough , Van Heflin is a demented person unable to hold a job . He plots to blow up a plane as a passenger , so that his long-suffering wife , the usually great Maureen Stapleton , will benefit financially . Our stowaway , Ada , will ultimately thwart that plot in a tension filled segment of the film while the plane is flying . Helen Hayes , as Ada , won her 2nd Oscar as best supporting actress . Maureen Stapleton was also nominated in this category for the same film . This win came after her first Oscar , 38 years before , for best actress in " The Sin of Madelon Claudet . " The weather is no help either as the airport is plagued with a major snowstorm . You'll still enjoy flying after this exciting film .
Good Night Mr . Tom-Keep Up that Stiff Upper Lip	Marvelous film again dealing with the trials and tribulations of World War 11 England . What makes this film so good is the touching of the human element . This film is definitely in the tradition of such British line classics such as " Mrs . Miniver " and " Hope and Glory . " As is the case with this film , we see the desperation of people in the time of war . The performances are outstanding here especially by the embittered John Thaw , who is assigned a child who has been evacuated from the London bombing . We soon see why this child wets his bed . He comes from a lunatic mother who has abused him terribly . The old man takes to the child and brings happiness into his sad life . When the child is returned to his mother , the old man goes to London and seeks him out only to find tragedy . He literally kidnaps the boy and is able to convince a higher up that the child is better off with him than being in a boy's home . The picture is so good because it deals and builds on endearing relationships .
Never Good Bye to this Biridie	A totally delightful musical for the viewer to see is the 1963 hit " Bye Bye Birdie . " Albert Peterson is a scientist who also likes to write songs . Janet Leigh , his long-suffering girl friend , can't get Albert to make a commitment due to his mother , hysterically played by Maureen Stapleton . Her scenes with her space shoes and mink coat were memorable . To plug a song , Leigh devises a plan to name a typical teenager , Ann-Margret , to kiss Elvis-like Jesse Pearson farewell , as the latter has been drafted into the army . This event shall take place in Sweet Apple , Ohio-America's conservative heartland . The film is buoyed by Margret's " film " dad played with zest by the late Paul Lynde . The finale with an overworked Russian ballet is a riot and memorable . Even , TV host Ed Sullivan plays a small role in this fun-filled flick . The music and dancing are marvelously staged . Who can forget " Goin ' Steady , " " One Last Kiss , " " An " English Teacher , ? " etc .
The Guardian-Highest Rating for this Film of Valor & Courage	Outstanding film dealing with rescue swimmers from the U . S . Coast Guard . Few of us realized how valuable these people are . After seeing this film , you shall certainly appreciate them even more . As Ben Randall , Kevin Costner has about the best part he has had in years . He is tremendous as a no-nonsense instructor to the young men applying for such positions . He is an unconventional teacher . He teaches you about hypothermia by placing you in that kind of situation . As a cocky student , Ashton Kutcher gives a solid performance as the know-it-all who has plenty to learn . Naturally , he hides a dark secret that occurred at age 16 . The film shows you what the trainees have to go through . It deals with their personal lives as well as Costner's wife leaves him as he is literally married to his job . While the ending will break your heart , this is a fabulous film dealing with people there to save lives . The film is a taut tribute to these people .
You're in For A Fabulous Bumpy Ride : Flightplan	Jodie Foster's best picture and performance in years in an exciting riveting film . This psychological thriller deals with a woman whose 6 year old daughter mysteriously disappears on a flight from Germany to N . Y . Problem is that no one saw this child on the plane and since Foster is bringing home her dead husband on the plane , it appears that she is hallucinating especially when word is received that the child died along with the husband . Where has this child been placed in this exceedingly large airplane ? The film is action packed and Arabs are suspected by Ms . Foster of being in the plot to kidnap the child . While I don't want to give away the surprise plot , I must say beware of air marshals . Exciting and action packed all the way with a wonderful cast . Peter Scarsgaard is wonderful in the role of the subtle villain . Greta Scacchi shines as a psychiatrist on board who tries to comfort the " grieving " Foster . I have not seen such airplane excitement since " The High and the Mighty " in 1954 .
Mad World Absolute Magnificent Mayhem	Go know that Stanley Kramer , best known for his films regarding social issues , would make such comical masterpiece . Go know that Ethel Merman , who could belt out any song in her day , would give a phenomenal comic performance is this all-star classic of 1963 . The picture begins with a great musical score which sets mood for what you are about to see . Jimmy Durante , plunges down a ditch and in his revealing words , tells of money hidden under the Big W at a California park . This sets off a wild and extremely memorable chase by those who have heard his words . Others will join in this mayhem . Kramer knew how to get every well known comedian into this hysterically funny film . Often used by Stanley Kramer in his other dramatic films , Spencer Tracy , as the frustrated police officer does an unusual comic performance and he was really good at it . Sid Caesar and Edie Adams are phenomenal as well as the dentist and his wife caught up in this chase for the money . Milton Berle goes through plenty with a mother-in-law such as Ethel Merman . The casting director deserves a lot of credit here for casting Ethel in the loud-mouth mother-in-law role . She really steals the films with her hysteria and antics . I would have thought of Connie Gilchrist for the part of Mrs . Marcus , but Merman is in fine form here . She gets great additional support from Dick Shawn , who portrays her crazy son and British comedian Terry-Thomas who meets up with the group and is drawn into the conspiracy . Phil Silvers is at his devilish best here . The way he orders around people reminds us of his presence as Sgt . Bilko in that classic television series . Jonathan Winters will just break you up here , especially when he goes berserk and destroys a gas station run by Marvin Kaplan and Arnold Stang , who were also made for their parts . The film may exaggerate what people would do for the mighty buck but it gives you the feel-good attitude and is certainly a classic to behold . The film also reunited Tracy with Mickey Rooney , 25 years after they made Tracy's Oscar-winning " Boys Town . " The film marked the end of Za-Su Pitts ' career . Ailing during the film , she died of cancer the same year the film came out . Note that Paul Ford , Ben Blue and Carl Reiner , all had smaller roles in this film but would be used 4 years later in the equally hilarious " The Russians Are Coming , The Russians Are Coming . " A time honored classic . Better now to see it at home . When I viewed the film in the theater , people were laughing out so loud that you couldn't hear the words .
Diary of A Mad Black Woman Scores	They just don't make pictures like this anymore . A high-powered attorney accepts the Jacob Feinstein Award for Attorney of the Year and soon qualifies as a heel not seen since Fred MacMurray's performance in " The Apartment . " He bodily throws his wife of 18 years out to be with his lover and the two children he has fathered with her . Our heroine returns to her poor dysfunctional family including 2 relatives who are hilarious at best . Bent on retribution , she returns to the mansion with one of them-a big fat grandma-like lady and they begin their path of destruction . What you think is your typical comedy of revenge soon turns into a fine drama with the power of love , religion and redemption conquering all . I haven't seen a movie turn from such comedy to drama since 1983's " Terms of Endearment . " Cicely Tyson is wonderful in a supporting role as a mother with strong religious convictions . She talks and acts like Jane Pittman . The movie shows that wickedness may be paid by punishment followed by redemption . It's a powerful message and is quite well done .
A Girl Like Me-A Social Tragedy For Our Times	Outstanding film dealing with a teenager who was totally female in thought but was born in the body of a male and suffered each day in his tragically short life . J . D . Pardo is excellent as the conflicted youngster . Former Oscar winner Mercedes Ruehl shines in the role of his mother who at first thinks that he will outgrow his obsession of being a girl only to find out that this shall be his way of life . She goes to bat for him all the way . This excellent film deals with a major societal problem regarding transsexual behavior . We saw it in " TransAmerica , " and " Boys Don't Cry . " While the ending is tragic , the film is well acted and creates a disturbing picture of what transsexual people have to endure in our society .
Nothing Like Roz as " Auntie Mame " Sizzles	Rosalind Russell received a well deserved Oscar nomination for " Auntie Mame " in 1958 . True to form , she lost the coveted award . Miss Russell did so much better with the New York Film Critics . She won the latter award several times but yet never garnered an Oscar . Needless to say , Russell is Mame in every sense of the word . From that cigarette holder to her talk on screen , Miss Russell captivated movie audiences with a gem of a comic performance . O Oscar , you need to have both a musical and drama award for acting like the Tonys on Broadway . When will you ever learn ? Forrest Tucker is effective as Beauregard Burnside , her ill-fated husband , who brought joy to a tumultuous life . Peggy Cass was nominated for best supporting actress Oscar as Agnes Gooch . She did well but was not given enough lines as in the 1974 film . A great film , wonderfully acted and performed by all .
Fried Green Tomatoes in Forever Tasty	Wonderful motion picture with a stellar cast . Kathy Bates , as Mrs . Couch , along with her husband , go to a nursing home repeatedly to visit his cantankerous aunt . While they get thrown out of her room repeatedly , Bates soon strikes up a friendship with one of the residents who tells her an unbelievable story of love , tragedy , redemption in the south following World War 1 . The older woman is marvelously played by the late Jessica Tandy , who received a best supporting Oscar nomination for her performance . There are wonderful performances by Mary Stuart Masterson and Mary Louise Parker who form a life's friendship following the tragic death of one's brother while trying to retrieve a hat lost by the other woman along railroad tracks . This is a story of a brutal marriage subjected to one of the girls . It is well told along the backdrop of the 1930s and the Ku Klux Klan operating in both Alabama and Georgia . The picture works well because it treats a murder of the abusive husband in a comical way and there is a triumph of the human spirit along the way . This film was vastly under-rated .
