A real Bomb	Always enjoy Steven Seagal in most of his films , however , this film was simply horrible . Steven Seagal , ( Jonathan Cold ) , " Today You Die " , ' 05 , was a wheeler dealer of a character and had just finished an assignment for a creepy looking sinister under-world person . Once again , Jonathan decides to take on another case to deliver a package . Everybody seems to want this package for some reason and all kinds of hoods decided to go after Jonathan and secure this important package . There is one hood that Jonathan tries to kill over and over and over again and never seems to succeed . Anna Louise Plowman ( Mrs . Meredeth Van Aiken ) , " Shanghai Knights " , ' 03 plays the wife of a very rich man who wants this package and Mrs . Van Aiken has some dealings with Jonathan , but not romantic . This entire picture is a Merry-go-round of simply a package and hoods never being able to be Killed .
Don't Waste Your Time on This FILM ? ? ?	Love all kinds of Horror films , from the silent films to the present day gems . However , this film is absolutely HORRIBLE . These college gals and guys fool around with an experiment besides trying to make out , but there is very little time for romance . The so called MONSTER is like a spoiled brat of a kid , who wants to chew up everyone in sight and has a horrible TEMPER ! ! ! The college kids try to extinguish this creature with gallons of gasoline and nothing seems to work , they run around in circles trying to get away and of course , some wind up in body bags . I have to give credit to the poor actors who tried their very best to create some kind of picture , Nicholas Brendon , " Psycho Beach Party " , 2000 and Jaime Pressly , " Footprints " , ' 02 . When the CAMPUS POLICE finally came to their rescue and asked them , " JUST WHAT IS GOING ON HERE ? " , the entire remaining CAST went SILENT ! ! ! If you want to waste your time and see a NOTHING of a film , THIS IS FOR YOU ! ! ! !
A Film about Nothing	Always enjoy great films which deal with the super-natural and the deep thoughts of the Spiritual world . However , this film just turned me off as far as its production and direction . There is nothing to go into deep discussion about what this story has to tell ; all I can say is that it was a big waste of time and effort to put it on the big screen . The actors , namely : Mark Addy , Thomas Garrett , gave an outstanding performance in his native land England , and we have seen him in " Still Standing " a TV Series . Heath Ledger , played the real wicked dude and we have recently viewed him in " Brokeback Mountain " , ' 05 , gave a great supporting role . Shannyn Sossaman , ( Mara Sinclair ) , did a good job of seducing a priest from a church not recognized by any faith . Don't waste your time , you will be sorry !
Dying Production	Decided to tape a film from TV which was scheduled for around 1AM and soon found out why it was hidden away in the wee hours of the AM . Always liked John Heard as an actor and he did a great job trying to hold this film together along with actors who just did not measure up as supporting actors . Most of the film showed John Heard drinking beer . throwing a beer bottle against the wall of his apartment and blowing smoke rings . There was constant flash backs of his young daughter running into the street after a ball she was playing with and his wife who was pregnant . I must say this film was not worth watching , it actually put me to sleep , causing me to rewind the tape to find out what finally happened at the end . This is a real SLEEPER of a FILM .
A Slight Bit Better	This film is really called Foreigner 2 : Black Dawn and Steven Seagal , ( Jonathan Cold ) once again appears in this film as a real bad dude dealing with all the horrible under-world characters . Seagal even directed this film and the stunts and action were very low key and not performed very professional . It looks like Jonathan Cold put on a few extra pounds and and is acting more like Marlon Brando with his almost silent whispers . Jonathan meets up with a gal he had known years ago and a very good looker , he does manage to save her from a very close shave with death . There are plenty of explosions and the real bomb is when you start watching this film and wonder when it will ever end . It is about time to put an end to these Foreigner series and move on to something more interesting .
Very Disappointing Film	For some reason I had figured this was going to be a good film to watch because the cast had great actors with outstanding talents . However , as I started to get interested in the film it made a down hill plunge into complete nonsense . However , you will get quite a few laughs out of the performance by Bette Midler , ( Bobbie Markowitz ) along with Glenn Close , ( Claire Wellington ) and Christopher Walkin , ( Mike Wellington ) . This film is a comedy and nothing more and is a Very Spaced Out Film which was a big waste of money and time to direct or produce . Skip this film completely . The only actor in this film who I enjoyed seeing was Bette Midler who really carried this entire film on her back .
Big BUG Is Mad & Hungry !	Enjoyed this film and the great acting by Karl Geary ( Marvin ) , who did a great job of acting like a person who had Strickland Disease and had me completing feeling sorry for him . Marvin's big hobby was being a simple PEEPING TOM , who enjoyed watching all his neighbor's , old , young and in between . I think his favorite window to look into was Carmen , ( Rebecca Nader ) , who seemed to get hot and bothered over Marvin and his great hobby of posting pictures all over the wall and especially hers ! Marvin's sister Rosy , ( Alexis Dziena ) was the person who introduced Marvin to Carmen and this of course started a wonderful relationship . There is plenty of mystery concerning the horrible habits of a Judas Bug that gets so hungry he tries to break into the trunk of a car . This film is entertaining and does not need to be put under a microscope and studied , if you don't like the beginning , Turn it Off !
A Long Train Ride	Found this 1952 film quite interesting , where a detective has to protect a very tough gal from the hoods that want to wipe her out . The poor detective has to travel from Chicago to Los Angeles with this gal and runs into all kinds of problems on the train . If you like trains , and seeing the dinning car in action , the Pullman compartments with their bunks on top , this will bring you back in the past , when train travel was a joy for many people and inexpensive . There are many strange characters on the train , one is a very large man who seems to block the passageways , a sexy blonde with a brat of a son , and mean looking mobsters from the City of Chicago . Very interesting , you just might like it !
FANTASTIC JAWBREAKER OF A FILM ! ! !	Once I started viewing this film , I could hardly keep my eyes off the TV screen , from the beginning of the picture to the very end . I never thought that a " Jawbreaker " could cause so very much trouble in one picture . The actors were great , every one of them : Rose McGowan ( Courtney Alice Shayne ) of " Vacuums " ' 02 ; Rebecca Gayheart ( Julie Freeman ) gave an excellent performance , in real life she had a horrible car accident which caused her great mental suffering . Julie Benz ( Marcie " Foxy Fox ) of " Taken " ' 02 , a mini TV series ; and Judy Greer ( Fern / Mayo / Vylette ) excelled in her great acting abilities from being a geek of a girl to a red hot swinger ! Judy Greer has many films in 2004 and is climbing up the Hollywood ladder with a fast pace . There was lots of comedy , romance , sexy talk and drama . There even was a moral lesson to be learned , don't try to hid the truth , face it , and last but not least , don't give a person a JAWBREAKER laying down in a bed ! !
Natalie Wood was Beautiful	Enjoyed this slap-stick film which dealt with all kinds of crazy things that Natalie Wood , ( Penelope Elcott ) " Sex & The Single Girl " , ' 64 , managed to get involved with , in order to get the attention of her husband , a Bank Executive . There are lots of laughs in this film and Natalie Woods had just gotten a divorce from Robert Wagner when she made this film and still managed to give a great charming and sexy role , where she runs around in her bra and panties . Peter Falk , ( Lt . Horatio Bixbee ) , " Columbo TV Series " plays a police officer and seems to be captivated by the wiggle of Penelope's body and takes exceptions to putting her in jail when she really commits a bad crime against her poor husband . It is rather sad to view this film and see a beautiful Natalie Wood and realize she had to die in such a horrible way in life .
His Brain Was Bothering HIM !	Found this film a complete spinner with flashbacks almost as soon as the picture begins . John Savage loses his wife in a horrible car accident with a truck and dives off a cliff and explodes . However , for some reason , John Savage begins to have dreams about his wife and this accident plays over and over again in his brain and it drives him crazy . Savage completely looses self control and winds up in a rehabilitation center where the head doctor treats his patients like animals in a cage . John Savage does have a very sexy nurse to take care of him and he has wild dreams about making love with her , so he is not completely nuts . If you like something to spin your own brain , watch this film and you will feel like you are in the SPIN ZONE and I forgot , the ending will blow your mind completely AWAY !
Taped this Film by Mistake	This film was shown in the wee hours of the morning and since I had taped this film by mistake , I decided I may as well find out what it was all about . Janet Leigh , ( Abby Ames ) , " Scaramouche " , plays the role of a very famous singer who was visiting Army bases during WW II and stops her car as she approaches the Army Base . Abby hears circus music playing from a wooded area of the camp and decides to see just what is going on and runs into Fearless a nice big Lion who has a dear friend called Carleton Carpenter , ( Pvt . Floyd Hilston ) " Up Periscope " . The entire film deals with a great performance between Fearless who plays with and even sleeps with Carleton . Great Animal film along with a very pretty Janet Leigh who was just starting out in her career . This is a worthwhile film to view and I was glad to have taped the wrong picture . Enjoy
Husband neglects Wife	This story is about a sort of attractive middle age wife with some middle age problems around the waist , who is being neglected by her husband in the sex department . This gal is Oliva Hussey , ( Catherine Gaits ) , " Headspace " , ' 05 , who is married to a very busy wealthy guy who just simply falls asleep as soon as he gets into bed . One day her husband decides to purchase a yacht and sends his wife off to settle the sale of the vessel . Catherine meets up with a young man , John Denison , ( Peter Thornton ) , " Karla " , ' 06 and Peter notices that she looks very much like his wife and he becomes very interested in her and they have a drink together . It is from this point on that things begin to go crazy and the picture speeds into action and the drama begins . Very good film for a TV Show , but sort of a copy-cat story we have seen many times before .
Mitchum Held the Picture Together	Always liked Robert Mitchum in most of his films and for some reason did not view this late 1950's film . This film is suppose to take place in Greece during the year 1941 and is occupied by the lunatic Nazi forces . Robert Mitchum , ( Mike Morrison ) , is an Army officer who manages to somehow get involved with some very secret information that can help the underground forces in Greece to destroy the Nazi strong holds during WWII . Mike Morrison meets up with a Greek gal and becomes romantically involved with her along with an other young gal who is very confused about what to do with her children . It is rather long and drawn out and at the same time , Robert Mitchum seemed very bored with his role and gave very little enthusiasm . The film wound up being very boring and way too long . The Nazi officer in charge was always sick and complained about not having a PULSE !
Too Many Flashbacks !	This was an interesting Horror film with some great humor and plenty of flashbacks to Viet-Nam and William Kott , ( Roger Cobb ) . I must confess this house is very haunted including the brain of Roger Cobb , novelist of Horror and is presently trying to write a book on his experiences of Viet-Nam which is a Horror Story all by itself . Cobb lost is son in a drowning accident and his wife left him and so he decides to live in a very old home of his aunts . The aunt was very weird according to all the neighbors and as you can guess , the house has many creatures roaming all around the entire place . Not a Bad Film , but really not GOOD .
Interesting Film	Enjoyed viewing this German film and the very strange story about a young man who is studying to become a doctor and decides to get some intern work with poor people who are not able to afford medical services . This doctor hits it lucky and meets some very important doctors who are very famous and is accepted into their hospital . After being in the hospital for a brief period of time , he meets a young female doctor who asks him to strip naked and even grabs his private parts for a sex experiment . As the film progresses , there are very weird experiments performed and plenty of drugs are being used constantly through out this hospital . Some parts of the hospital are nothing but Butcher Shops with plenty of blood and gore , plus plenty of cuts being performed on human bodies . The only female in the picture is very hot to trot , but is very ugly and old .
Great Christmas Film from 1947	Enjoyed seeing this film which has a Christmas theme and concerns three adopted men who have gone in different places in the world after being adopted by their Aunt Matilda Reed , ( Ann Harding ) . George Raft , ( Mario Torio ) had a background of serving time in prison and escaping into a foreign county . The second adopted son is George Brent , ( Michael Brooks ) who is a con-artist and the third son is Randolph Scott , ( Johnny ) who is an alcoholic and is a sort of burned out cowboy from the West . Their Aunt Matilda wants to locate these adopted sons and have them at her house on Christmas eve . The reason she wants to bring the family together is she is fearful her nephew is trying to cheat her out of her fortune , as she is very rich . This story goes into great detail about each of her sons which is very interesting with plenty of comedy , drama and even three babies get involved . Cute Film .
Lots of Everything	If you like comedy , horror , sexy gals , nudity and girls running around in their underwear , this is the film for you . There is great photography from Idaho over snow covered slopes and mountains along with a trail of blood and guts . This story starts off with a group of young people who enjoy snowboarding and some just love to just plain ski and they are invited to a friends ski lodge . However , the local town people are not very happy about their arrival in their community because there was the killing of a very young gal which caused many problems and the lodge has been closed down with hopes of opening it up real soon . This is a good Halloween film and it will hold your interest . Enjoy .
Sophia Loren was so Beautiful	Gregory Peck , ( Professor David Pollack ) , " Old Gringo " , plays a professor who is kidnapped for a brief period and is told to reveal the secrets of an Arabic writing which is his specialty . He is shot at , hit on the head and thrown out of a truck and meets up with Sophia Loren , ( Yasmin Azir ) , " The Black Orchid " , who runs into him all the time and decides to help him escape from his captives . However , Yasmin tells so many lies that David does not believe her and begins to think she is working against him . There is plenty of comedy , drama , romance and action . This is not exactly an easy film to just sit back and relax , it keeps you wondering just what is really Going ON
Entertaining Film	The beginning of this film is very strange with a man , Paul Decker , ( Peter Van Eyck ) crawling around in a dark room and turning off various connections and inserting hoses and then you see him wearing a snorkel . As the film moves on you begin to realize just what is going on and discover that Paul Decker is up to no good and has caused many deaths . There is a daughter who becomes suspicious of her father Paul Decker and she is constantly watching him and even goes to the police , but no one believes her . Jean Edwards , ( Betta St . John ) tries to help Paul's daughter because she also has a love relationship with Paul , and the daughter and father definitely do not get along . This film will hold your interest and entertain you right to the very end , which is really funny . Enjoy
Great Si-Fi Film	There is plenty of action in this film dealing with people from another planet who send information to some scientists who are interested in UFO's and communicating with them . These scientists obtain information from outer space about a DNA embryo which they fertilize and a baby by mistake is born and escapes into the world . Xavier Fitch , ( Ben Kingsley ) is in charge of this experiment and calls in a group of people who can help him locate where this baby has disappeared to . Dr . Laura Baker , ( Marg Helgenberger ) assists Xavier in their search and finds out that this baby is no longer a child but a full grown woman and they have to locate this person quickly because she has already killed quite a few people and desperately wants to have a baby whenever she can find the most suitable man . There is plenty of blood and guts and very romantic scenes which usually wind up in a blood bath death . Marg Helgenberger , star of CSI Las Vegas gave an outstanding performance in this film and I can fully understand why she was selected to star in the CSI TV Series where she deals with DNA all the time .
Great Entertaining Classic Film	Sure missed this film over the years and was very glad I was finally able to view it on TV . James Coborn , ( Harry ) , " Intrepid " , played the role of a master at the art of pickpocketing and also had a side kick , Walter Pidgeon , ( Casey ) " Funny Girl " who gave a great supporting role . Michael Sarrazen , ( Ray Houlihan ) " Feardotcom " was starting out as an apprentice to this field of putting your hands in other peoples pockets . Trish Van Devere , ( Sandy Coletto ) " Messenger of Death " , was also in on this racket and her lover was Ray Houlihan . Trish would wear very very short skirts and bend over to distract young and old men in order to enable her co-workers to pick their pockets dry . This four some went from city to city and had a ball doing whatever they pleased . This is truly a great classic film from 1973 with James Coborn at the top of his career and his supporting cast were outstanding . Enjoy
Classic B Film	This Black and White film from the late 40's had a great deal of class and great acting . Steve Brodie , ( Steve Randall ) , " Frankenstein Island " , ' 81 , played a guy who had all the bad breaks and never seemed to be able to settle down with the gal or off spring and have a nice home in a small country town . Audrey Lang , ( Anne Randall ) , " Born to Kill " , ' 47 , was the wife of Steve Randall who did her best to help him make the right decisions and even got him to marry her . Steve and Ann Randall kept running away from a terrible threat made by Raymond Burr , ( Walt Radak ) , " San Quentin " , ' 46 , who was seeking revenge for the loss of a close family member . Jason Robards Sr . , ( Detective Lt . , Louie Ferrari ) , " Impact " , ' 49 , played the detective who was very interested in Steve Randall and hounded him where ever he traveled . There are some very tense scenes in which Walt Radak uses a clock to drive Steve Randall to a complete breaking point in his life . Great classic B film with a very young looking Raymond Burr and Jason Robards Sr . giving a great supporting role .
A Simple Accident on the FDR	Enjoyed the great acting of Ben Affleck , ( Gavin Banek ) along with an outstanding performance by Samuel L . Jackson , ( Doyle Gipson ) who are total strangers until they both have an accident on the FDR in New York City . Gavin Banek is a financial lawyer who works for his father-in-law who owns the firm and is being groomed for bigger and better things in this law firm .

This accident causes problems for both of these men and the entire story deals with how these two men are able to face some very difficult lessons to be learned by both of them . There is no romance just a very confused bunch of guys dealing with their problems in unbelievable ways and causing more problems than is necessary . John Hart , " Body Heat " is a sponsor for Doyle Gipson in his AA Group and does everything he can to make sure Doyle does not take a drink .
Wall Street & Trinity Church	This film goes back in history to the Declaration of Independence and a treasure hunter named Ben Gates , ( Nicolas Cage ) who decides to steal the Declaration of Independence which has a key to secret treasure which can be revealed on the back of the Declaration and leads to all kinds of clues .

Whitcombe , ( Herbert Marshall ) hired Steven's wife at his law firm and offered his assistance to the hospital in order to arrange for financial aid for his young son of 6 years of age . Audrey Totter gave an outstanding performance and is a rather under rated actor who appeared in many films , as of this date , Auderey is 90 of ages . Enjoy
Lots of Fun Film	This was a great entertaining film with plenty of action and lots of laughs . Emile Hirsch , " Lords of Dogtown " , plays the role of a very bright high school student and even President of his class , however , he was still not popular with most of the guys and gals of his senior class . Elisha Cuthbert , " House of Wax " , moves next door to Emile and gives him a free show of her body from her bedroom window and then proceeds to visit his home and asks for help getting to know the town and its hot spots . Elish did not tell Emile that she was a former porno star and poor Emile was still a virgin and very shy trying to put the make on sexy Elisha .

The story is written by John Le Carre , who has written many espionage books and in this picture , Leiser , ( Christopher Jones ) plays the role of a Polish defector promised political asylum in England . However , he has to go back behind the Iron Curtain to investigate the possibilities that East Germany is building a rocket in violation of a disarmament pack .

Great film with great actors , all very young and starting out in their films careers .
Gem of a Film	If you love to see old planes of the German's and British , this is the film for you . There is excellent photography and you actually see how the German's bombed London and destroyed many parts of the city and also how people ran to the air-raid shelters . There is a husband and wife who have joined the RAF and it clearly shows the problems of a married couple both serving in the same unit . There were many young British gals who joined up to serve their country and it showed the dramatic strain it had on all these very young girls . This is a great film because it shows how the British had to fight with the German's and the horrible bombings the German's did to the British people .
Talented Classic Actors	Edna May Oliver , ( Hildegarde Withers ) was a fantastic actress and her supporting actor was also a great actor , James Gleason , ( Inspector Oscar Piper ) . In this film Hildegarde investigates a murder in a New York City School which involved a very pretty young teacher who was involved in some very dark secrets . There is a blackboard that plays a very important role in this murder mystery which was musical notes placed on a C staff which reveal an important clue to the person who committed this murder . Edna May Oliver and James Gleason give an outstanding performance with very quick wit of words between each other and it is also very comical and funny to watch two great veterans doing what just comes very natural for both of them . Don't miss this great film Classic from 1934 .
Holmes Met His Doom	This is a great film about Porno Star John Homes , played by Val Kilmar , " Kiss Kiss Bang Bang'05 , who gave a great performance portraying the Screw King of all time and how he eventually got screwed himself . Apparently , after John Holmes burned out , and got tired of measuring his 14 inch pride and joy , he went down into the horrible depths of drugs and more drugs . Lisa Kudrow , ( Sharon Holmes ) , " Marci X " , ' 03 gave a great supporting role as John's wife , who deep down really loved him , but John just used her like everyone else he came into contact . Christina Applegate " Tilt-A-Whirl " , ' 05 gave a good supporting role along with a few other stars like Carrie Fisher . The moral of this story is you will always " REAP WHAT YOU SOW " .
Tom Selleck was Great	Enjoyed this picture which dealt with a farmer , Stephen Landis , ( Tom Selleck ) who lives with his wife and his wife's daughter . It seems that Stephen was married to another woman and they also had a daughter and his ex-wife was having problems with her teenage daughter and decides to send her to her father for a few months during the Summer . The teenage girl is from the city and on the wild side of life and going on a farm will simply blow her mind completely away , which it does . There are all kinds of problems that face this family during the Summer and of course , one of the girls becomes pregnant along with cows as well . Nice drama and Tom Selleck gave an outstanding performance in this film which was photographed in The State of Idaho . Good viewing .
Great 1937 Classic	Enjoyed viewing this great film classic from 1937 and enjoying a long forgotten actress , Deanna Durbin , ( Patsy Cardwell ) , " For the Love of Mary " . Patsy plays a very talented young girl who has a fantastic voice and a father who is an unemployed musician played by Adolphe Menjou , ( John Cardwell ) , " Bundle of Joy " . John Cardwell goes behind the scenes where Leopold Stokowsk has just conducted a Symphony Orchestra and asks him for a job as a trumpet player or even a trombone or whatever . There is some drama and great classical music selections along with plenty of comedy by great talents like Billy Gilbert and Eugene Palette ( John R . Frost ) , " The Mark of Zorro " . Leopold Stokowsk was a famous conductor during this period of time and married a few women and had children , one of the marriages was to Gloria Vanderbilt . If you like an old time Classic , this is a good film to view and enjoy the great singing of Deanna Durbin . Enjoy
Jim Carrey Was Great	Have not watched very many films of Jim Carrey and this particular film had me laughing through out the entire film . Jim played the role as a Rhode Island State Policeman who lives in a very modest home , a box , and just got married to his bride and carried her over the threshold and things started to happen which I would never have dreamed could happen . It seems that after their first , second and third son was born that the marriage went down hill for some odd reason . Renee Zellweger , ( Irene Waters ) meets up with Officer Bailey Gates / Hank Evans ) played by Jim Carrey who has a split personality and is constantly fighting with himself and Hank Evans . The rest of this film is filled with a great comedy situations in motel rooms and cars being pushed into gravel pits and unbelievable train rides and some way out comedy skits . Enjoy
Great Sydney Pollack Debut	Sidney Poitier , ( Alan Newell ) plays the role of a college student attending a college in Seattle , Washington who went directly from his classes to a Crises Hotline Center where he serves as a volunteer . Alan expects to spend a quite evening at the center and brings along plenty of his textbooks for studying . Telly Savales , ( Dr . Joe Coburn ) is the boss at the Center and tells Alan Newell that he is not going to be with him this evening and has a special event to attend , so Alan is going to be on his own during the entire night . It does not take too long before a telephone call comes into his office from a drunken barber who rambles on and on and then a telephone call is called in by Ann Bancroft , ( Inga Dyson ) who has taken pills in order to commit suicide . As soon as Alan Newell finds out this is a real crises for emergency assistance and it is all up to Alan to use everything in his power to stop Inga from taking her life . This is a rather long drawn out film , but worth the time to view and enjoy .
Great Pearl S . Buck Film	Enjoyed the great acting by the entire cast and especially Katharine Hepburn , who plays the role as Jade Tan who lives with her family on a farm and everything is very peaceful and happy for years . However , when the Japanese evade China these peaceful times turn into a complete disaster for the farming community . Walter Houston , ( Ling Tan ) plays the role as father and his wife Ling Tan , ( Aline MacMahan ) both give great supporting roles . Akim Tamiroff , ( Lu Lien ) becomes friends with the Japanese and is really a traitor to his Chinese family . The Japanese treated the people very poorly and their was rape and constant killing of innocent people . This story reminded me of a book entitled , " The Rape of Nanking by Iris Chang " which talks about the horrors that Japanese soldiers performed against innocent Chinese people which is told in this picture .
Long Ago & Far Away	This is definitely an outstanding 1944 musical with great young stars and famous veteran actors under the direction of Charles Vidor . Rita Hayworth , ( Rusty Parker ) , " Charlie Chan in Egypt " , sang and danced with Gene Kelly , ( Danny McGuire ) , " Anchors Away " , Danny McGuire owned a night club in Brooklyn , N . Y . and was in love with Rusty Parker who was a dancer in his club along with Phil Silvers , ( Genius ) , " Coney Island " , who was the comedian in this picture and also worked and dance together with Danny , Rusty . Otto Kruger , ( John Coudair ) , " Duel in the Sun " played the role as a promoter of a cover girl magazine and decided Rusty Parker was going to be his top model . Jerome Kern's music is heard through out the entire picture and the song , " Long Ago & Far Away " is the theme music for this musical . This film was nominated for many awards and was a big hit at the box office during WW II which kept peoples minds off of the war that was going on at the time . Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly were instant hits and their career's exploded on the silver screen for many many years . Great Musical and a film you will not want to miss , this is truly a great Classic Film . Enjoy
Great Classic Actors	If you enjoy a good submarine picture that takes place during WW II with Japan in the Pacific Ocean , you will definitely enjoy this film . Clark Gable , ( Cmdr . ' Rick ' Richardson ) commander of a submarine a few years early in thewar encountered a very drastic defeat by the enemy and was placed behind a desk . It was not too long when Richardson decides he is going to see the top brass about commanding another submarine and it is granted . However , Burt Lancaster , ( Lt . Jim Bledsoe ) wants to be the commander and he is turned down and Rick Richardson wants him on his sub and of course , plenty of trouble starts among the crew who are all on the side of Lt . Jim Bledsoe . There is plenty of action and you will soon find out why the title of this film is Run Silent Run Deep .
Irene Kane & Jamie Smith Made this A Great Kubrick Film !	Missed this great film of director Stanley Kubrick in 1955 . The black and white effect was perfect for this depressing story . However , it was enjoyable watching these two actors , Jamie Smith ( Dave Gordon ) , " Only Fools & Horses ' 81 TV Series " and Irene Kane ( Gloria Price ) " All That Jazz " ' 79 , look at each other through the windows of their one room apartments in the same building , dressing and undressing and looking very depressed and down in the dumps . Jamie was a down and out prizer fighter and Gloria was a dance for hire gal , who was down on her luck working along Broadway , NYC and being taken advantage of by the villian , Frank Silvera ( Vincent Rapallo ) " Valdez Is Coming " ' 71 " . Stanley Kubrick wanted this film to be a very realistic film about two people being drawn together by hard luck , therefore , he had these actors act just the way ordinary people would act in REAL LIFE , it makes it appear that they are both poor actors , which is far from the truth . It was great to see a man and a woman become drawn to each other and be able to try and cope with their horrible situations in life . This a great Classic film by Stanley Kubrick ! !
ONE OF JOHN WAYNE'S GREATEST FILM !	As other viewers have commented , I personally viewed this film when I only paid 35 cents for admission and it was well worth it . John Wayne was my idol and just the thought of going down under the water was extremely unimaginable and fighting all the horrible creatures we just read or heard about was never viewed on a big screen . ( Radio was our only big entertainment and we had to use our IMAGINATION ! ) In 1948 the country had just gotten over WW II and Hollywood did not have all the special effects it has in 2000 ! I have viewed this film over and over again and still remember how it kept me on the edge of my seat . All future generations will do the very same thing and admire how much the film industry has advanced in their technology . This is a great John Wayne Classic and to find fault with it is uncalled for .
BORIS KARLOFF IS A GREAT INDIAN !	I was able to tape this film years ago . It is not often seen on TV and a true classic film . Tap Roots takes place at the outbreak of the Civil War , Lebanon Valley tries to secede from the state of Mississippi and remain neutral . Hating slavery , its leader , Hoab Dabney ( Ward Bond ) , and a faithful Indian friend of the family , Tishomingo ( Boris Karloff ) , promise to protect the valley against the Confederate army . There is a great cast of actors namely : Susan Hayward , Van Heflin and Julie London ( former wife of Jack Webb , Dragnet T . V ) Tap Roots is rather long and drawn out . However , the plot has romance , excellent photography of the Civil War costumes , sex situations and the action is of great value . Karloff is excellent as an Indian guide of the family and his make-up makes him look just like a Native American . I noticed the Smoky Mountains located in North Carolina and Tennessee where this Mississippi story was filmed which is magnificent to view .
Joan Crawford was Radiant	Enjoyed this 1930's film starring Joan Crawford , ( Gerry March ) who lives with several girls who all work for a department store , some girls sell perfume and most of them are fashion models . All the girls are looking for the right man to marry who has money and they also want to throw away their alarm clocks and stop working and have babies . Gerry March has been around the block a few times and is always on guard against men who try to hit on her mainly because they have hurt her very badly in the past . Gerry tries to caution all the girls and stays pretty much to herself until Tony Jardine , ( Robert Montgomery ) enters her life and she really falls for him in a big way until he brings her to his secret tree house which looks like a penthouse suite and stairs that fold up . Tony is her boss at the department store and after the tree house scene , Gerry writes him off her list as a typical male trying to score . Great entertaining film , and if you like to see what women wore in the 1930's this is the film for you .
Bruce Dern vs . James Garner	James Garner , ( Jason McCullough ) is offered a job as a Sheriff for one-hundred and fifty dollars a month and has never had any experience in ever being a sheriff and he has only been in the West for about four years after living in the East . Jason meets up with a bad dude in town who is a big trouble maker named Joe Danby , ( Bruce Dern ) and he is put in jail by Jason , however the jail has no bars on the jail but he puts him into handcuffs . There is plenty of slapstick comedy with a gal named Prudy Perkins , ( Joan Hackett ) and she begins to have a crush on Jason and he soon begins to realize how pretty she does look like however she serves her father and Jason a dinner and gets her dress on fire and Jason puts it out by throwing a pitcher of water on her rump . Walter Brennan , ( Pa Danby ) gives a great supporting role as the father of Joe Danby and he demands to get his son free from jail , however , Joe killed a man and that is why he is in jail . Very funny and enjoyable film . Enjoy .
Nice Mysterious Film	Had no idea what type of French film this was going to turn out to be , so I gave it a try and became very interested in the characters portrayed by Jean Gabin , ( Jean ) who was a French soldier who was bound and determined to go AWOL and had a hatred for almost everything , mostly GUNS and explosions . Jean is broke and manages to locate an old shack near a river where an old man gives comfort to people who are homeless or just plain Hopeless in Life . A small cute dog seems to attach himself to Jean and follows him where ever he decides to go , after a while he becomes very fond of the animal . At the same time , Jean meets up with a very beautiful woman at the Old Man's Shack , Michele Morgan , ( Nelly ) who has had bad luck in the choice of men she makes love to . Jean and Nelly run around trying to figure out just what they want to do in life and fate has another plan for both of them . There is some very deep spiritual secrets in this film and I enjoyed it from beginning to end .
Classic Orson Welles Film	This was a true story and this picture gives a close look into the behind the scenes of the rich and famous years ago and depicts how some of their spoiled brats used their higher education to do just about anything they wanted , especially to young girls . Orson Welles , ( Jonathan Wilk ) , comes to the aid of the two young men accused of murder after they had been grilled night and day for a confession by E . G . Mrshall , ( District Attorney Harold Horn ) . The case looks rather bleak for the two young men and Jonathan Wilk decides he is going to try to uncover any new evidence to clear his clients . If you like Orson Wells and his acting , this is a great performance of a very wise attorney only trying to do his job despite Klu Klux burning crosses on his front lawn .
Mickey Spillane No Actor	Enjoyed everything that Mickey Spillane wrote and enjoyed this film , but Mickey just did not fit into the role as Mike Hammer , he should have stayed at home by the typewriter . Even Hy Gardner , a famous , NYC newspaper reporter and Radio personality added greatly to this film with his assistance to Mike Hammer . Lloyd Nolan , ( Federal Agent Arthur Rickerby ) , " A Tree Grows In Brooklyn " gave a nice supporting role , who was a great Classic Actor in his early career in Hollywood . The real hot sexy number in this picture was Shirley Eaton , ( Laura Knapp ) , " Goldfinger " , who did everything she could to tease and please Mike Hammer in hot bathing attire by the pool and in the bedroom . By the way , Shirley Eaton was the girl painted in Gold Paint during the filming of " Goldfinger " . Great classic black and white film you will not want to miss .
Great Eugene O'Neill Story	Never viewed this film and was completely surprised at the great acting by Burl Ives , ( Ephriam Cabot ) and Sophia Loren , ( Anna Cabot ) . Ephriam is an old man who runs his farm with a steel arm and treats his son's like dirt and he manages to work his wives to death on the farm . There are three sons and two of them decide to run off and go to California . While , Eben Cabot , ( Anthony Perkins ) stays on . Eben was very close to his real mother and she told him the farm was his and she also told Eben where Ephriam hid his money under a rock in the woods . Ephriam decides to find another wife and chooses a young 25 year old gal from Italy , Anna Cabot , ( Sophia Loren ) who makes herself right at home on the farm and manages to wrap her 76 year old husband around her little finger . Eben does not get along with Anna very much at first , but things do start to happen to these two in a romantic way . Excellent film and the ending you will never be able to figure out . Enjoy .
Great film but Unknown until Recently	Enjoyed this great newspaper story which took about three months to produce for a budget of about Three-Hundred & Fifty Thousand Dollars by Samuel Fuller the Director and Producer . Fuller was able to give a fifty year history of the newspaper business within this very film and it deals with two main characters , Phineas Mitchell , ( Gene Evans ) who decides to create a newspaper called the " Globe " with a group of other newspapermen who need work and they all get together to make this possible . The other person in this film is a woman named Charity Hackett , ( Mary Welch ) who is the editor of the " Star " which is a very established newspaper and they are a powerful voice in New York City on Park Row . The Globe's front page headline is about a man who jumps off the Brooklyn Bridge which is a leap of 120 feet into the East River . The Globe begins to over power The Star and Charity Hackett begins to get very upset because she realizes that her paper needs a complete change in is obtaining good news stories and things of interest for the public . The Globe was able to get an inventor who created the Linotype Machine for printing and they also started to raise funds for the land in which the Statue of Liberty would be built on . This is a great film and whenever you get a chance , don't miss this film .
Rape Upset Her Life	Carroll Baker gave a great performance as Mary Ann Robinson who was an only child and her mother told Mary Ann the outside world was dirty and filthy and their neighborhood was changing for the worst . Mary Ann one day was attacked and raped and it changed her complete outlook on life . Mary Ann washed herself constantly and felt she was very dirty and a bad person . Mary runs off and goes to the Bronx where she rents an apartment with horrible living conditions . This story becomes more complicated as Mary wanders around the City of New York working in a Five & Dime Store and then going up on the Manhattan Bridge and doing away with her life . This is a very well directed film and Ralph Meeker , ( Mike ) gave a great supporting role along with Jean Stapleton , " All in the Family TV Star " . Don't miss this film .
Outstanding film	This picture will capture your attention from the very beginning to the end and it never stops getting more and more involved with plenty of gore and the language is unbelievable . The story starts off with Joey Gazelle , ( Paul Walker ) who is involved in a money and dope operation and things go bad and a dirty cop gets shot . Joey is told by his gang members to get ride of the gun and make sure the cops do not find it . Joey goes in his basement at home and hides the gun but his son and another young boy hide and watch where his father put the guns . One of these boys takes the gun and tries to stop his father from beating up on his mother . Joey goes nuts when he finds out and knows he is in big trouble with his gang members if the police get this gun and the bullets . This particular gun causes more trouble in the lives of so many people and even causes people to kill each other in an ice hockey stadium . One scene on the ice is a hockey player shooting a puck into the mouth and face of his victim . There is some very steamy love making scenes and plenty of people being killed all the time .
LEE REMICK TAMES JAMES COBURN	James Coburn ( John Cunninghman ) gets very distracted when Lee Remick ( Sheila Metcalfe ) enters his room as a hooker and gives him plenty of action . He almost forgets about doing his final hit to retire on . This film is filled with great actors , Burgess Meredith ( Ramsey Williams ) who also played in Rocky 1 and Rocky 2 . Karen Black ( Ellen ) and Sterling Hayden give excellelnt supporting roles along with Lilli Palmer ( Adrianne ) , Lee Remick's close friend . This film cannot be ignored , it has too many veteran actors to make it an all time classic film of the late 60's .
Contact Lenses Change Appearance !	This is a great 1950's Classic film with great veteran actors and a very excellent plot which keeps you wondering how this crime will be brought to Justice ! Richard Basehart , ( Warren Quimby / Paul Southern ) , " The Satan Bug " , ' 65 , plays a mealy mouthed pharmacist who pushes pills at night and has a wife who is bored to death with him . Audrey Totter , ( Claire Quimby ) , " The Carpetbaggers " , ' 64 , plays the wife to Warren and decides to have a very hot and sexy affair for a different change of menu in her life . Cyd Charisse , ( Mary Chanler ) , " Party Girl " , ' 58 gets involved with Warren Quimby and falls in love with him while she takes his picture in front of his apartment dwelling . Barry Sullivan , ( Police Lt . , Collier Bannabel ) , " Harlow " , ' 65 tries to solve the murder and gets very close and warm with Claire Quimby who wraps him around her little finger more than twice . Contact Lenses were apparently quite new in society and Hollywood seemed to think it would change someone's identity completely . This is a great Black and White Classic and worth viewing .
Outstanding WW II FILM	Never viewed this film until recently and was very surprised at how well produced and directed this film portrayed . There is a cast of all time greats , some just starting out in their careers , such as : James Caan , Michael Caine , Sean Connery , Elliott Gould , Gene Hackman , Anthony Hopkings and Robert Redford and many many more . This film clearly showed what it was like fighting the Germans and how at times each side had compassion for the others in treating and caring for their wounded , nothing like the fight with the JAPS . ( As they were called during WW II ) . However , " Private Ryan " topped this film , but is a great second outstanding World War II Film I have ever seen . Great acting and down to earth realism .
Charles Burnett Film Is Great	It was great to view this film by Charles Burnett , who wrote the story and directed the film and also did the camera work . Burnett was working on a budget and was able to obtain left over color film from MGM who were willing to sell him this film for his picture . This film deals mostly with a great actor , Pierce Mundy , ( Everett Silas ) who is a hard working son in his mother and fathers dry cleaning business and Pierce is a very kind and giving person who cares for his mother and father and takes good care of his grandparents . Pierce has a brother who has become a lawyer and he intends to marry a very rich pretty young gal and Pierce does not seem to get along with his brother or his future in-laws . The film is very funny and it also has its serious moments where Pierce has to face a decision whether to attend his brothers wedding or go to his best friends funeral . Don't miss this film , it is a great masterpiece by Charles Burnett .
Hollywood Version	Have read various books which dealt with Joseph Goebbels one of Hitler's right hand men who carried out the murder of Millions of Jewish people and many more people from various countries . Goebbels had some very dark secrets as a young man growing up who carried out all his sick mental problems on other people . Joseph Goebbels is played by Wolfgang Zilzer who did a great job of acting and also looked very much like the real person . Goebbels in real life loved all kinds of women and he really loved Maria Brandt , ( Claudia Drake ) who was a very pretty German actress who gave Joseph a hard time . However , Hollywood twisted the story which made Goebbels into a person who was not as evil as he really was . In real life , Goebbels really went to bed with this famous German actress and was really married to a very beautiful woman who had to turn her back on all his affairs . Nice 1944 film .
Jennifer Lopez Tames a Snake ?	Being a big fan of Jennifer Lopez , " Angel Eyes " , ' 01 , I could not resist viewing this horror film and the horrors of a snake you have never seen before just hugging and hugging the entire cast to DEATH . Ice Cube , " Friday after Next " , ' 02 , was a great supporting actor who had a hard time trying to keep Jennifer Lopez out of harms way . Jon Voight , " Zoolander " , ' 01 , played a real real bad character who simply loved snakes and was a complete Snake himself through out the entire film . If you hate snakes in any way , this film will keep you on the edge of your seat in more ways than one . A great entertaining film because it has the charm of Jennifer Lopez , however , her charm does not seem to tame the Big SNAKE .
Susan Hayward & Tyrone Power Had Their Hands Full	Always enjoyed greatly the films which Tyrone Power and Susan Hayward appear in , they were great actors and put their hearts and souls into any role they had to play . In this picture Tyrone Power , ( Tom Owens ) , " Blood & Sand " , ' 41 , managed an outpost for stagecoaches and travelers . Tom met up with Susan Hayward ( Vinnie Holt ) , " I'll Cry Tomorrow " , ' 55 , and her little daughter and had some very unwelcome visitors who caused all kinds of problems and forced Tom & Vinnie to turn their entire lives upside down along with the little child who could hardly walk , but kept them on their toes . Jack Elam , ( Tevis ) , " Hannie Caulder " , ' 71 , played a very over sexed animal of a man who could hardly control his feelings for any woman . This picture keeps your interest to the very end and is a great Western Classic .
Enjoyed this Old Timer	This was a definite look back at the past when John Wayne was very young and starting out on a great career in films . There really is no stampede , except the bad guys trying to blame Stony Brooke , ( John Wayne ) for a crime he did not commit . However , the local town people want justice and are convinced that Stony is responsible for this crime and must pay for it . Stony is put in jail and his lady friend , Nanvy Carson visits him while the jail is set on fire and they are both destined to die in the blaze . Tucson Smith , ( Ray Corrigan ) and Lullaby Joslin , ( Max Terhune ) try to come to his rescue . Lullaby Joslin is also a ventriloquist and there are some funny scenes with his dummy talking and making jokes . If you look real close , you will see the famous villain of all Western Films , Charlie King . Great John Wayne Classic film , enjoy .
The Big Fight Era	Heard my grandfather talk about Jim Braddock and what a real down to earth man he was living in New Jersey and this film is truly a great tribute to a down on his luck prize fighter who had a second chance and even fought with the great Joe Lewis . Jim Braddock was played by Russell Crowe and he did one of the best performance I have ever seen , along with the great acting performed by Renee Zellweger as his wife Mae Braddock . There were many great boxers during those years , Willie Peppe , Jack Dempsey , John L . Sullivan , Joe Lewis and the list goes on , but Jim Braddock was truly a great person in real life and a true Champion of the Boxing Profession . Fantastic film to ENJOY
A Gem of a Film	This was a film I enjoyed from the beginning of this right to the end because of the funny story and the outstanding cast of great actors . Gene Tierney , ( Maggie McNulty ) , " The Left Hand of God " meets John Lund , ( Val McNulty ) , " Steel Town " and marries him immediately and has never even met his mother . Val McNulty's mother is Thelma Ritter , ( Ellen McNulty ) , " Pillow Talk " , who has a hamburger stand in Jersey City , New Jersey and is running into problems with her business and has to sell her hamburger stand and decides to pack up and visit her son . Ellen arrives at her daughter-in-law's apartment and gets mistaken as a cook who they are seeking to hire for a big party they are going to arrange . It is from this point in the picture that things start to get rather crazy where two mother-in-laws are living with the newlyweds and not realizing that the cook is Val's mother . This is a great 1951 Classic comedy with two great actresses Gene Tierney and Thelma Ritter . Don't miss this film , it is lots of fun to view .
Your MOM & DAD are Your Best Friends In The Entire World !	It is very easy to pick this film a part , and it is probably very easy to say that I would never get trapped like Jordan Ladd , ( Martha Hoagland ) , " Puzzled " , 01 , into an Internet Chat room or my daughter or son would never be that stupid to be lead away from our home by total strangers . If the mom in this picture , Cheryl Ladd , ( Connie Hoagland ) , " Lisa " , ' 90 , had noticed the signs of withdrawal by her daughter when she practically lived in the bedroom and gave complete devotion to the Computer , Jordan would never have faced the problems she faced . She was seeking Love in all the wrong places and the break up with her boyfriend sent her over the edge . This film is reminding us there is always someone in the Internet Chat Rooms who are playing very horrible games and pretending to be someone they really are not . This film pointed out the fact that Mom & Dad's are our best friends , and should be trusted enough to tell our most deepest SECRETS ! Remember , our parents were all very young ONCE , and can really help you with your deepest , darkest PROBLEMS ! Let Them HELP !
Telephone Line At Work !	Missed this great Black & White Film Classic with Edward G . Robinson , George Raft and a great cast of Classic Actors ! In this film Edward G . Robinson , ( Hank ' Gimpy'McHenry ) , " The Red House " , ' 47 , is the boss of a gang of linemen who have the hard task of putting up electric and telephone lines . George Raft , ( Johnny Marshall ) , " Red Light " , ' 49 , plays a rough guy who looks after his buddy ' Gimpy ' and does not like Marlene Dietrich , ( Fay Duval ) , " Touch of Evil " , ' 58 who is an all around the town gal . Gimpy falls deeply in love with Fay and wants to marry her in the worst way , even if she does not love him . This is an entirely different story and the all the great actors make this a truly great Classic film from the 40's . !
Unbelievable Western	Definitely missed this Henry Fonda film and was very glad that I caught it on late night TV . I could hardly believe all the great humor and drama portrayed in this Italian Western . After watching this film for a few minutes , you are unable to determine in just what direction the film is going to take . A poor local town barber and his son seem to get into a big mess of things , when a few bad bad cowboys decided to go to get a shave or just plain trouble . In another scene you see Terance Hill , ( Nobody ) , " Renegade " , ' 87 , take an apple away from a baby and eat the entire apple and gave it back to the child . Henry Fonda , ( Jack Beauregard ) , " Fedora " , ' 78 is a man who is burned out from being a gunslinger and wants very desperately to go to New Orleans and simply Retire . There is a hold up of a Federal Reserve Train and a wild scene of two guys in a latrine , looking face to face and trying to relieve themselves . This is a must see film , you will greatly enjoy watching and especially if you are a Henry Fonda fan .
A CLASSIC LUGOSI FILM !	In this film Bela Lugosi was the first to be harmed . Lugosi tried to make an atomic superman but what he got was Tor Johnson , a bald and bulgy wrestler . There is no doubt that this is a B Film from the middle 1950's , however , we must remember that Bela Lugosi ( Dr . Erick Vornoff ) , " The Black Sleep " , ' 56 , was one the greatest Classic Horror actors besides Boris Karloff . These films were Mr . Lugosi's last pictures before he went on to another Spiritual Stage ! His last picture was playing Dracula 1966 ! You can pick a part this picture all you want to , but always remember that Bela Lugosi will out live EVERYONE ! ! Bela Lugosi was trying to make a come back after having been a drug addict for years and these films helped him to try and gain his self-respect ! ! ! !
LAURA DERN FOLLOWS IN FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS ! !	As a great fan of Laura Dern and her father Bruce Dern , I have always loved their great acting skills and in this picture Laura as Lula , kept this movie really moving with fantastic WILD dancing , red hot sex scenes along with Nicolas Cage ( Sailor ) who tried real hard to keep up with Lula's every desire even though she had visions of the good and bad witch from the Wizard of Oz . Lula was a very unusual role to play , who loved her man more than anything else in this entire world and it was great to see that Sailor finally found his place in her life along with his cute son . Dern fans , this is a must and if you admired and respect Nicolas Cage's great talents , view this film over and over .
Kristy Swanson Was HOT	Kristy Swanson , ( Francesda Wells ) gave a very convincing performance as a very very bad girl who would do anything for money and a completely wild life . Francesda is every young man's dream of a gal who is Easy and eager to please all kinds of men and has no regard for law and order . In other words , this gal has no soul and lives from day to day and loves to destroy most of the people she encounters . Jeremy London , ( Danny Wells ) , " Kiss Me Again " , ' 05 , is the brother to Francesda and adores his sister and will do anything to protect her . However , in many ways she really uses her brother to accomplish her needs and desires . The poor mother has to put up with this daughter of hers and the entire film makes you hope and pray you never have a daughter like Francesda . Great acting by Kristy Swanson and Jeremy London .
Heartbreaking Story	Angelina Jolie , ( Sarah Jordan ) , " Mr . & Mrs . Smith " , ' 05 gave an outstanding performance as a young lady who attended a Relief Benefit for Needy Children and People and viewed a young boy half starved to death . Sarah was not really happy with her marriage and decided to raise money for the man who headed this Relief Benefit ; Nick Callahan , ( Clive Owen ) , " Sin City " , ' 05 and headed out on her own to help provide the needs of the sick and poor people in different countries . There is a romance that sparks between the scenes of horrible conditions dealing with human beings and crude methods of operating and caring for the sick and disabled . After viewing this picture , I found myself not complaining very much about things in general and being grateful for all the things and life I have in America . Get the Tissue Box out , you will need it .
Lots of Hot Love Making	This TV film was great , it had lots of romance , mystery and the story kept me guessing right to the very end . Angie Everhart , ( Lana ) , " Bare Witness " , ' 02 , married a very very rich older man and kept him very busy in bed much to his delight . However , the rich man's son returns from Harvard and accidentally walks into her bathroom while she is in her birth day suit and from then on , sparks seem to fly and the plot takes off in more ways than one . Andrew W . Walker , ( Holden ) , " The Secret Pact " , ' 99 , is the rich man's son and after staying around the mansion for a while and getting to really know his father , he finds out his father has some very horrible and mysterious hang ups . You will find this film very hard to figure out and it is a very well produced film to enjoy .
KARLOFF PLAYS A PHONY PSYCHIATRIST !	This film has a cast of all time veteran actors . Walter Mitty ( Danny Kaye ) , a very soft spoken proofreader for a magazine publishing house , tries to escape periodically from his routine existence in DAYDREAMS . A woman ( Rosalind van Hoorn ( Virginia Mayo ) " The Girl from Jones Beach " ' 49 seeks his aid in getting away from a strange character who seems to be following her . Later on Mitty gets involved with an international ring of jewel thieves . A phony psychiatrist is among the gang members , Dr . Hollingshead ( Boris Karloff ) who attempts to push him out of a window . Karloff does everything in the book to convince Mitty that he's NUTS . If you love Danny Kaye , who played Capt . Hook in Peter Pan TV 1976 , you will love this film . Karloff gave this film and extra boost and played a calm and sinister doctor for a change !
Great Drummer from the Past	Always enjoy listening to the great talent of Gene Krupa along with Buddy Rich . This is a film dealing with Krupa's childhood which dealt with his becoming a Priest and then a world famous drummer in the 1940's . Sal Mineo , ( Gene Krupa ) , " Rebel Without a Cause " , ' 55 , did a great job of trying to imitate Gene on the drums along with Susan Kohner , ( Ethel Maguire ) , " Freud " , ' 62 , who was his girlfriend and loyal supporter through out this picture . This film portrays the good and bad times of Gene Krupa and most of his bad times were caused by a frustrating childhood and a great love of his mother and father , who both demanded too much from their son . Great Class film along with great musicians .
Entertaining Film !	Greatly enjoyed viewing this film on dvd and liked the photography filmed in NYC , Broadway and very beautiful night scenes of the former World Trade Center and its many famous bridges . Robert DeNiro ( Detective Eddie Flemming ) , " City by the Sea " , ' 02 played an excellent role as a drinking cop who was madly in love with Melina Kanakaredes ( Nicolete Karas ) , " Providence " ' 99 TV Series , a TV reporter , who wants to make it to the big time and Eddie helps her get some big scoups . There is a very loveable scene where Eddie is trying to propose marriage to Nicolette , ( who looks radiant ) and Eddie gets his tongue twisted trying to say the magical words every woman in love wants to hear ! This movie had lots of action with ugly killings and some mild nudity . If you are a great fan of DeNiro and Kanakaredes you will over look this production and just plain sit back and enjoy a crazy , wild and nutty entertainment !
THE 1935 original Film Version was GREAT !	Alfred Hitchcock in 1935 did everything he could to have his favorite actress Madeline Carroll in this picture , he always loved to have blonde women to perform in his pictures . This 1935 version of " The 39 Steps " was very comical how they tried to show two people in bed fully clothed and the shocking scene with Madeline taking her stockings off . Hitchock always tried to surprise the audience in any way that he could . Just having Madeline Carroll and Robert Donat handcuffed together must have given plenty of people a bundle of laughs . However , Hitchcock had to direct this film in London , England , America was not ready for such a naughty Drama / Comedy .
Kiefer Sutherland was Fantastic	Never viewed this film and was completely surprised at the great performance Kiefer Sutherland , ( Kevin Richter ) , " 24 " TV Series , gave as a very mentally disturbed young man around 17 years of age . Kevin Richter just sits on the floor under tables , chairs and does not speak to anyone . Marsh Mason , ( Jennifer Hubbell ) , is a specialist in mental disorders and is chosen to take on this case , which all the doctors in the hospital think is completely hopeless and a big waste of time . Jennifer Hubbell tries to obtain medical records and personnel files concerning this very troubled young man and goes around completely in circles . There are days when Kevin improves and other times when he completely goes out of control . There is a scene where Jennifer tries to bring Kevin to a Pizza shop and he hides under the table and I need not tell you anymore . If you like Kiefer Sutherland , please do not miss this film .
Enjoyed this 1931 Version of the Film	Discovered this original film of " The Maltese Falcon " 1931 and was amazed how this version of the story was produced . The film stayed pretty close to the Humphrey Bogart , Sidney Greestreet and Peter Lorre theme . However , Ricardo Cortez ( Sam Spade ) and Bebe Daniels ( Ruth Wonderly ) acted completely different and the cheating of money from an envelope , caused a gal to have to take all her clothes off , in order to find out where she might have hid the money . Just mentioning the word take your clothes off in those days was probably horrible in a film during the 1930's . The ending of the picture was completely different , and the gal in question was treated with kid gloves . I always felt the Bogart Maltese Falcon could have done away with Mary Astor , the gals in this picture were more sexy and attractive that the 40's version .
Louis Calhern & Liz Taylor Carried this film on their BACK !	If you are a great lover of the classic piano and violin solos and want to see Elizabeth Taylor portray her real personality with men , as she did in real life with husbands , this is the picture for YOU ! Elizabeth Taylor ( Louise Durant ) , " Secret Ceremony " , ' 68 was a woman who fell in love with two men who had great talent . Vittorio Gassman ( Paul Bronte ) , " Mambo " , ' 55 , who was a struggling violin player who caught Louise's eye and captured her heart strings . John Ericson ( James Guest ) , " Bad Day at Black Rock " , ' 55 was a piano student struggling with money problems and also fell in love with Louise . Louis Calhern ( Nicholas Durant ) , " The Asphalt Jungle " , ' 50 was Louise's father who had plenty of money to allow his daughter to do as she pleased , but seemed to give her great advice when she needed it . Vittorio Gassman came to America to actor in a few films and later on become a great star in Italy , like our Spencer Tracy in the US . Louis Calhern was a great veteran of the screen and gave an outstanding supporting role to Liz Taylor . Much credit should be given to a great violinist , Michael Rabin who performed all the solos .
A Big Surprise	This story starts out very calm and quiet in a average American town with a married woman , Vanessa Marcel , ( Sydney Carpenter ) , " Storm Watch " , ' 02 , who is offered a career in the film business , which she had prior experiences . However , she loves her husband , Thomas Gibson , ( Matthew Carpenter ) , " Come Away Home " , ' 05 and her little son and decides to stay home and be a good mother and wife . Matthew Carpenter does very little communicating with his wife and they do manage to sleep in the same bed and things do happen , once-in-awhile . It is at this point that I begin to wonder just what is going to make this film interesting and is it going to be a good mystery . As this film progressed further , I was very much in for a Big Surprise and never stopped looking at the screen . Vanessa Marcel all of a sudden appears are a very charming young woman who has an outstanding female figure and is full of life and determined to find out some very dark problems in her marriage . You will enjoy this film and it will keep you guessing right to the very end .
Refreshing Story	This film was very refreshing to watch and enjoy because of the very down to earth story of a small town after WW II and the deep effects war has on people and how it can ruin people mentally and physically . Chris Klein , ( Noah ) , " The Long Weekend " , plays the role of a soldier wandering around and just plain getting out in nature and sleeping under the stars and mostly fishing . Noah meets up with an old gentleman who tells him how to fish like a professional and also directs him on the right path for him to take into a wonderful valley where there is a nice small town and good fishing in a lake . Noah meets up with all the local town people and also with Gretchen Mol ( Eleanor ) " Attracton " who gives a great performance as a woman who is deeply troubled and living with a grandmother who only wants to eat Hersey Bars . Sweet lovable story back when they had rumble seats in the back of cars . Enjoy
LUCINDA WEIST WAS A SEXY GHOST ! !	This film kept me guessing throughout the entire picture , the photography and location was simply beautiful . Ally Sheedy ( Susan Enright ) " A Good Night to Die " ' 03 and William R . Moses ( Mark Enright ) " The Painting " ' 02 picked out a very old beautiful Victorian Home with a hidden Widows Watch room with all kinds of treasures from the past history of the occupants . Susan and Mark wanted to start a nice BED & BREAKFAST and have a new start in life after Mark had an affair and they were drifting apart as husband and wife . The home is also occupied by spirits who are troubled and wish to do the same to Susan & Mark . Lucinda Weist ( Sara Warner ) " Net Worth " , is really a mistress Ghost from the past and tries to capture Mark's heart and soul with very tempting scenes . Sara finally decides to take a nice swim into the ocean and leaving plenty of questions unanswered . Veteran actress , Louise Fletcher , " One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest , ' 75 tires to help Susan cope with all the mysterious things that happen in this mysterious lovely haunted B & B ! ! ! !
Great Submarine Film	Have always been a big fan of Gerald McRaney , ( Admiral Eugene Justice ) who gave an outstanding supporting role in this Naval story about a struggle between Commander Miles Sheffield , ( Casper Van Dien ) who became the skipper of the Lansing Sub over Lt . Commander Albert Kenner , ( Stewart Bick ) . However , when North Korea sets off a nuclear bomb and completely upsets all the crew on the Lansing and causes many mental problems among the entire crew on board . This is something like the " Caine Mutiny " except the Lansing can possibly destroy many innocent nations of the world . There is plenty of great acting and there is only one female Lt . in this film who assists Admiral Eugene Justice and in many ways solved many major decisions in finding out just where the Lansing Submarine can be found . This is a very entertaining film with plenty of suspense and important decisions to make in a matter of a few seconds . Enjoy .
THIS FILM TOPPED ALL THE EARTHQUAKE FILMS !	Earthquake 1974 is a classic film with outstanding film actors who will never be forgotten . Charlton Heston ( Steward Graff ) ( " Ben Hur " ' 59 ) ; Ava Gardner ( Remy Royce Graff ) ( " Barefoot Contessa'54 starring with Humphrey Bogart ) ; George Kennedy , ( Sgt . Lew Slade ) ( " Blue Knight TV series and " Cool Hand Luke " ' 67 ) ; Lorne Greene ( Sam Royce ) ( " Bonanza " ' 59 ) ; Barry Sullivan ( Dr . Willis Stockle ) ( " Harlow " 65 ) ; Lloyd Nolan ( Dr . James Vance ) ( " A Tree Grows in Brooklyn " ' 45 ) and last but not least , Walter Matthau ( A DRUNK in a bar ) ( " Sunshine Boys'75 ) All these actors made this film a great classic , not the special effects , lets remember , this film was made in 1974 not in year 2000 . There will never be another Earthquake Film with such great actors giving their complete support to make this an enjoyable entertainment for generations in the future to admire and respect . This is not a film to be critical about , all actors have to make a living , whether they are old or young ! ! !
Not JUST Another RAPE Film !	There is nothing worse that can happen to a young girl , young lady or even an elderly woman as RAPE ! This film starring Lindsay Wagner , ( Molly McKinley ) , " A Light in the Forest " , ' 02 , works as a Rape Care Center Director in a rather run down building with very little funding . Molly was also a former Nun and meets up with Holly Marie Combs , ( Sophia DiMatteo ) , " A Reason to Believe " , ' 95 , and tries to help her inform the proper authorities about the horrible violation to her body . This is a very down to earth film and shows how the very rich and powerful town people try to prevent Holly from getting a fair trial in a Court of Law ! A very good TV Film to VIEW !
Tea Leoni & Nicolas Cage were a Great Team !	Have always been a great admirer of Tea Leoni , ( Kate Reynolds ) , " The Naked Truth " , ' 95 TV Series ( Nora Wilde ) , she had a great TV series and was very funny and sexy . However , in this film she was able to show her great acting talents and also her natural beauty seemed to explode in this picture . Nicolas Cage ( Jack Campbell ) , " Snake Eyes " , ' 88 gave an excellent performance as a Wall Street Giant and a simple down to earth Tire Salesman . A great family picture which had a great moral lesson LOVE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN M O N E Y ! and living a simple normal life has its greater rewards , like children and family . There two actors were fantastic together !
Jolie & Bonderas Burn Up the Screen !	This film was fantastic for the great acting performed and the beautiful location in Mexico and great photography . Antonio Bonderas ( Luis Antonio Vargas ) , " Imagining Argentina , " ' 03 , ordered a bride who was really very much like himself in many ways . However , Angelina Jolie ( Julia Russell ) , " Taking Lives " , ' 04 , had a mind of her own and enjoyed all sorts of men , especially Actors who played the DEVIL ! The film kept you guessing about where this love between these two lovers was really going to lead us . Antonio and Julia made a charming couple and especially when they were both involved in gambling with cards . There were hot scenes in the bed and a giant old time bath tub which got quite steamy ! Angelina Jolie looked very beautiful and the close ups of her face and lips were FANTASTIC ! ENJOY .
Great Cast of Famous Actors !	Viewed this film when it was first shown in New York City and always enjoyed the great acting of Claude Rains , Constance Bennett , Joan Caulfield , Audrey Totter and Hurd Hatfield . This was a very well produced picture with great photography of Long Island parkway scenes and the old water front sections of Manhattan . Claude Rains , ( Victor Grandison ) , " Phantom of the Opera " , ' 43 , was a mystery writer and had his own radio show with all kinds of old time recording equipment and secret compartments to hide his mysterious goings on at home and in the studio . Joan Caulfied , ( Matilda Frazier ) , " Dear Wife " , ' 49 gave a great supporting role and was very beautiful in the close up shots of her face in black and white . Audrey Totter ( Althea Keane ) , " Jet Attack " , ' 58 was very sexy and attractive . Althea and Victor both knew each other very well and kept a watchful eye on each other through out the entire picture . It was nice to see Hurd Hatfield ( Oliver Keane ) , " The Picture of Dorian Gray " , ' 45 make an appearance in this film and played his role to perfection . There was even a car chase in the end of the picture and lots of drama in an old time JUNK YARD ! Don't miss this great film , it is really worth watching .
Great McBride Series	Enjoyed viewing John Larroquette , ( McBride ) , " Happy Family " , ' 03 TV Series , perform as a lawyer who had a kind heart and was willing to defend a client who had no money and was deeply involved in a murder which was almost air tight against him . The film starts off with a very sexy hot looking blond driving along and stops at a Diner and mets a guy who needs a ride . The blond buys him a cup of coffee and gives him a ride to his destination . Once the blonde drops him off in front of his apartment things start to happened and McBride gets to work trying to solve a murder mystery which is very hard to figure out . Very enjoyable film and entertaining ; it should be made into a TV Series .
WE NEED MORE FILMS LIKE THIS ONE EVERY YEAR !	Hollywood for years portrayed drinking and smoking in all its films and continues to do the same thing in this century , making it look like a very important part of the social life for everyone , rich or poor , young or old . If you had a hard days work or wanted to have a ball , they showed famous actors and actresses having a martini and smoking in almost every scene . Drinking was an escape from the reality of having to face life and its many problems we all have to face . This picture about three ( 3 ) young gals looking for a good time , showing false ID's is an on going problem and does not end with this movie . ( it is done with High School & College Students ) Bonnie Root , who plays Lizzie Williams , enjoys drinking Vodka straight from the bottle , while other girls , Janie Palmer ( Marisa Rudiak ) and Kate Jenkins ( Deanna Milligan ) like to drink wine coolers or just plain beer . ( all of these are addictive ) As the movie progresses , each girl seems to drink occasionally and increases as time goes by , however , Lizzie seems to enjoy drinking more and more vodka . They are all very intelligent young ladies with straight A's , and have been told many times about the danger of drinking , however , they do not think it can happen to them , they really are not aware of the dangers of really drinking and its very addictive abilities to destroy your body and mind ( BRAIN CELLS ) . One of he girls was able to turn off their drinking habits with no withdrawal symptoms ( which is very hard to break , like smoking , but WORSE ! ) and went about their lives , however , Lizzie has an never ending fight with drinking . There really is no END to this movie so long as people DRINK & DRIVE and care nothing about their brothers and sisters in this world around them . The movie proved that you can really enjoy the natural JOYS of living without a DRINKING HIGH which vanishes the next day . Some of these girls thought that just drinking beer and wine was not as bad as hard booze , and found out it all leads them in the same direction . Having to drink everyday or on schedule , is a good sign you need HELP !
A MUSTACHE CAUGHT THE KILLER ! !	This 1934 film had a cast of movie legends along with Edward G . Robinson ( Damon Welles ) who also starred in " The Red House " and hundreds of other films . Mary Astor ( Jessica Welles ) , who starred in " The Maltese Falcon " ' 41 with Humphrey Bogart . Even Mae Clarke ( Daphne Martin ) who was on " General Hospital ' 63 TV Series as Marge . Louis Calhern ( Stanley Vance ) played a nasty con-artist in this picture and was dispised by everyone , even Damon Welles . Louis Calhern starred in " Asphalt Jungle " 1950 along with Marilyn Monroe and had a long career in the 1920's to late 1960's . In 1934 , this was considered a great drama or mystery , unfortunately , the plot was very poor , but the Actors made this a True Film Classic .
Great Entertaining Film	Enjoyed viewing this picture from beginning to end and how two families growing grapes in Napa Valley could have such a strong love and hate relationship . The entire cast of actors gave outstanding performances and I thought that Patricia Heaton , ( Sara Rosa ) showed her real talents and even rode a horse around the vineyards . This engagement ring was given with great love and in a way , caused a great deal of hatred for many many years among these two families . There is lots of humor , drama and cute romance with husband and wife and some live together couples , getting to know each other . I really think this story of these two famines should be made into a TV series , or at least make up a TV program using most of these fantastic actors .
Excellent Halloween Film	This film is full of blood and gore , however , it starts out with a group of young camp leaders and young children who are getting ready to end their camp tour . This group are having a good time telling creepy stories and one story teller tells them about an old farmer who goes crazy and starts chopping up human bodies and it just so happens that his old home is still standing on the property of the camp grounds . There are plenty of young couples who manage to make love and there are also ones who are fighting all the time about making love or not . If you like a good horror film with lots of thrills and chills , don't miss this good Halloween Film .
KARLOFF IS A BIBLE FANATIC !	Learned that this film was shot entirely on location near Yuma , Arizona with temperatures over 110 degrees . The music was created by Max Steiner and was nominated for an Oscar . This picture was also a remake of an earlier English film in 1929 of the novel . I also noticed there was not a woman in the cast , and no wonder , with all that heat during takes ! During the First WW1 , a patrol of British cavalrymen find themselves stranded in the Mesopotamian Desert . A veteran sergeant ( Victor McLaglen ) is in command . They camp at an oasis , and Arabs kill a sentry and steal their horses . It seems they are surrounded by unseen enemies and are killed one by one . The three remaining soldiers are : Morelli ( Wallace Ford ) , the sergeant ( McLaglen ) and Sanders ( Boris Karloff ) , a religious nut ! Karloff goes insane , and creates a makeshift cross and starts across the desert . Karloff as usual has bulging eyes and tormented facial expressions . Boris made this film another great classic . It is a worthwhile enjoyable film to view .
Very Down to Earth Film	Missed viewing this film in 1995 and was able to enjoy viewing all the great actors in the film and the wonderful portrayal of young girls growing into a very warm and loving relationship . Rosie O'Donnell , ( Dr . Roberta Martin ) , played an excellent role as a young girl who had a very bad habit from childhood of eating food all day long , non-spot . Melanie Griffith , ( Tina , ' Teeny ' Tercell ) was a very charming gal who desired to become a great sexy movie star and arrived at the gals reunion with a stretch limo and driver . Demi Moore , ( Samantha Albertson ) , played a very troubled young gal , who seemed to be lacking in love and the full meaning of life . This film showed very clearly how young gals confront young boys and in one scene in the old swimming hole of Summer , the gals stole the boys underwear and left them stark naked , except for a few towels the young boys were able to cover up with . Enjoy !
Great 1955 Classic	John Ford sure directed a great classic film about West Point and Tyrone Power , ( Marty Maher ) played the role of an Irish immigrant who is hired to work at West Point as kitchen help . Marty broke so many dishes in the kitchen that he quite that job and enlisted in the Army at West Point and he married a sweet pretty Irish girl named Mary O'Donnell , ( Maureen O'Hare ) . Marty and Mary enjoyed their life at West Point and they both met and made good friends of the cadets and some of them they treated like their own sons . Donald Crisp , ( Old Martin ) played the role as Marty's father who came from Ireland and Ward Bond , ( Capt . Herman J . Kohler ) gave a great supporting role to this film . Robert Francis , ( Red Sundstrom Jr . ) gave an outstanding performance and it is sad to say he was killed in real life in a plane crash right after making this film , he also starred in the Caine Mutiny along with Humphrey Bogart . Truly a great Classic film which you will enjoy from the beginning to the very end .
James Woods Gave a Great Performance !	James Woods ( Gregory Powell ) , " This Girl's Life'03 " , played a very hateful person , who was cold blooded and heartless , and claimed to be a family man . John Savage ( Karl Hettinger ) , " The Drop " , ' 93 played the role as a detective who seemed to lose his gun to Gregory and was subject to all kinds of problems at home and on the job . Franklyn Seales ( Jimmy Smith ) , " Southern Comfort " , ' 81 was a convict who just got out of the slammer and got involved with Gregory and also makes love to Gregory's pregnant wife and starts out on the wrong foot . Jimmy Smith tells the police : " I don't know what a conscience is nor the feeling of Wrong or Right " . Franklyn Seales was a great supporting actor to James Woods , it is sad that Franklyn had to die at a very young age . If you love James Woods , don't miss this film !
History of a Famous Gun Inventor !	Some how I just seemed to have missed this great film of James Stewart and his great acting and a very entertaining film . James Stewart , ( David Marshall , ' Marsh ' , Williams ) , " Bell Book & Candle " , ' 58 , winds up in a prison camp with nice stripe uniforms and a very bad attitude towards writing home to his wife , and his prison warden , Wendell Corey , ( Capt . H . T . Peoples ) , " The Big Knife " , ' 55 . Capt . Peoples tries to break Marsh down to his way of thinking and as a result , he starts making automatic weapons . Jean Hagen , ( Maggie Williams ) , " The Big Knife " , ' 55 , gave an outstanding supporting role as the wife of Marsh . If you want to see a young Stewart and a very entertaining story , watch this great CLASSIC !
Realistic / Down to Earth / What Life is All About	Outstanding film which maybe rather short in length but it tells more in ten ( 10 ) minutes than a two hour film . There is unhappy men and women who are desperate for a different kind of experience with a male or female and feel trapped in their marriage or relationships . This story will always be successful because people like to view people who do things they would like to do or have done against their husband and wives . The Director and Producer have contributed great talent to the entertainment industry and desire complete praise . I sincerely hope that these talented people all produce many more great films that will entertain us in the up and coming years into the future .
Great Acting by Kevin Spacey	Found this film very entertaining and at the same time , it made me very upset with a Boss that would have driven me crazy . I doubt very much if I would have taken that kind of abuse , no matter what the salary was or how much I wanted to be a success in the Hollywood as a producer . Kevin Spacey ( Buddy Ackerman ) , " The Tower of Babble " , ' 02 did such a fantastic job of acting his horrible part as a boss , you were convinced he was a real person . Frank Whaley , ( Guy ) " A Good Night to Die " , ' 03 , was the poor slob who started out his new career under the wonderful supervisor , or Boss , Buddy Ackerman . Guy has no one to turn to except a very sexy and hot looking Michelle Forbes , ( Dawn Lockard ) , " Perfume " , 01 , who befriends him in more ways than one in bed and guidance to stand up to the Big Boss . Excellent film to sit back and enjoy , don't miss it .
Outstanding Foreign Film	It was great viewing this foreign film from 1965 with great acting by Ida Kaminska , ( Rozalie Lautmann ) who is a very old Jewish lady who runs a fabric store and also buttons of all kinds . Jozef Kroner , ( Antonio Bitko ) plays the role as a good carpenter who is very lazy and not very interested in his profession and he also has a very nagging wife who drives him crazy . This story takes place in the Czeck Country during World War II and the country is being taken over by the Nazi's and Hitler is doing his best to get rid of all Jewish people in this very small town where everybody knows everyone . Antonio Bitko has a brother who has become a Nazi and gives his brother a new position which is to take over Rozalie Lautmann Button Store because they know she is Jewish and they are taking over all the Jewish establishments in town . As soon as Antonio Bitko gets deeply involved with Rozalie Lautmann he begins to have a great admiration for her and tries to protect her from being put in a cattle car and the concentration camp . This is a great story and a film you will not want to miss .
VAMPIRE PICTURE TOPS ALL VAMP PICS !	Viewed many vampire pictures throughout the years , and this Vampire picture portrayed the evil , lust , horror , murder and lots of blood drinking and passonate bitting with very beautiful women . Tom Cruise ( Lestat de Lioncourt ) " Minority Report " ' 02 and Brad Pitt ( Louis de Pointe du Lac ) , " Confessions of a Dangerous Mind " ' 02 both showed their great acting skills and could almost make you sick to your stomach with all the gory details . If you really want to see a fantastic VAMPIRE FILM , which will make Lugosi look meek and mild , watch this film for Halloween !
