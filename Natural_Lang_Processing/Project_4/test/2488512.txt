I really wasted forty-three minutes of my life watching the first half of this crap	A Brazilian cable television is presenting " Yadon Ilaheyya " this month in its " Cult " channel . I saw the trailer and listened to the advertisement , and decided to see this movie . Indeed it is an absurd boring pretentious dumb pointless disconnected crap about the conflict in the Middle East , and together with " Soultangler " , they certainly are the worst movies I have tried to see . I really wasted forty-three minutes of my life watching the first half of this crap , highly indicated for torturing enemies . How can this movie be awarded and nominated to prizes inclusive in Cannes ? My vote is one ( awful ) . Title ( Brazil ) : " Intervenção Divina " ( " Divine Intervention " )
Non-Sense , Bizarre , Weird and Sick Trip of a Director / Writer	In Tokyo , when fifty-four high-school students commit a collective suicide , jumping from a platform in Shinjuku Station , the police force leaded by Detective Kuroda ( Ryo Ishibashi ) has no clue to follow . Then he receives an e-mail from a young woman , Koomori ( Yoko Kamon ) a . k . a . The Bat , advising that there is a site where red dots mean the number of persons that died . Kuroda and his team investigate the deaths going nowhere . The premise of the storyline of " Suicide Club " is original and intriguing , reason why my daughter and I decided to see this film . However , the non-sense , bizarre , weird and sick story seems to be a bad trip of the director and writer Sion Sono . We saw this messy movie and we have not even understood its genre ( very black humor ? ; thriller ? ; horror ? ) . Sorry , but the explanation of difference of cultures is not acceptable to justify this terrible and disappointing film . It is indeed a very bad movie . Further , there are many good reviews promoting this film by users with only one review published in IMDb , showing a total lack of credibility . Title ( Brazil ) : Not Available
So Amateurish and Flawed that Becomes Funny	After a Halloween on a Friday , Laura Kove ( Jillian Byrnes ) becomes agoraphobic . One year later she finds that her apartment is haunted . She searches in Internet and finds Elizabeth Dean ( Jennifer Servary ) , a con ghost hunter , actually a stripper with a peepshow on line , offering her services and Laura and her best friend Nikki Brandt ( Marianne Hayden ) hire her to get rid off the fiend . Elizabeth investigates the past of Laura and discloses the truth of the mystery . " Ghost Watcher " is so amateurish and flawed that becomes funny . It is the typical movie that you join your friends to make fun and laugh so ridiculous it is . I do not know how producers invested in this film with such terrible screenplay and cast . The story is horrible , the three lead characters are awful and their actions make no sense . Elizabeth , for example , is a slut that risks her life to help Laura , inclusive dying in the end , solves the murders of a serial killer in a couple of hours , in a absolute lack of coherence . Nikki killed and buried Malculm Dixon , but she accepts to go to the abandoned house in the night to show the corpse to Elizabeth after seeing the weird events in Laura's kitchen . And Laura is pure contradiction , hiring a stripper to hunt ghosts . If any actress of this flick reads my review , do not be upset with me , but the acting are simply awful in this movie . I do not intend to see " Ghost Watcher 2 " , therefore I hope to have the chance to see any of you in the future with better performances in another movie . Title ( Brazil ) : " Após a Morte " ( " After the Death " )
Disappointing and Lame	In accordance with a Korean legend , every five hundred years , a woman protected by a man transforms in a serpent to fight against a dragon in a battle between good and evil . In Los Angeles of the present days , after a mysterious accident , the reporter Ethan Kendrick ( Jason Behr ) recalls his meeting fifteen years ago with Jack ( Robert Forster ) , who owned an antique shop and told him that he was the one supposed to protect Sarah Daniels ( Amanda Brooks ) . Ethan seeks out Sarah and together they fight to survive and destroy the devilish dragon . " D-War " is a disappointing movie , with a lame story of the director and writer Hyung-rae Shim associated to a terrible acting of the unexpressive lead couple . The screenplay is ridiculous and boring , supported by reasonable special effects only and together with the art of the cover of the DVD , they are the best offered by this feature . Title ( Brazil ) : " D-War ? Guerra dos Dragões " ( " D-War ? War of Dragons " )
Awful : Predictable and Full of Clichés	Brian Goodman ( Craig Sheffer ) is a scientist specialized in drilling operations . He aborts a dangerous perforation , leaded by Alan Morrisey ( Harry Van Gorkun ) and Darryl Simmons ( James Russo ) and destroys the whole project and facilities . A few years later , he is working with his friends Sam Dalton ( Bruce McGill ) and Rodney Bedecker ( Wil Wheaton , from Star Trek ) , when he detects an abnormal movement of the tectonic plates , provoked by Alan's new enterprise . Brian meets Alan , and together with Allison Saunders ( Terry Farrel ) , a highly graduated scientist from MIT , try to stop the movement of underground layers of Earth . This flick is awful : very predictable and full of clichés . The characters are badly developed , the story is horrible and it does not work . The best part is the ironical dialog of a married couple , asking for information in a road bar . The Brazilian distributors called it ' Catastrophe ' , maybe a hint regarding the terrible quality of this film . Title ( Brazil ) : ' Catástrofe ' ( ' Catastrophe ' )
Absurd , Long , Boring and Flawed Story With Awful Characters	A swarm of African killer bees attacks an Air Force base in Texas , then the small town of Marysville and later Houston . A team of scientists , leaded by the arrogant Dr . Bradford Crane ( Michael Caine ) , tries to find an antidote and an effective way of destroying the lethal swarm against the military command advice , that wants to restrain the area . " The Swarm " is one of the most absurd , long , boring and flawed story with awful characters that I have ever seen . The annoying Dr . Crane , for example , is arrogant , does not show any education or respect for the others , takes very bad decisions , and hangs around with the gorgeous Capt . Helena Anderson , performed by Katharine Ross , instead of being in the base where he is in charge of the whole operation . The silly teenager Paul is responsible for the death of more than two hundred persons and is patronized by Crane and without any further consequences but his moralist death . General Thalius Slater , performed by Richard Widmark , behaves like a puppet in the hands of Crane and has terrible lines . And the senior triangle of love ? What is the point ? The train wagons exploding and on fire is one of the most ridiculous scenes I have ever seen . How could they explode and burn ? It was imperative that the nuclear power plant should not shutdown , therefore why Dr . Hubbard did not ask the operators to wear protective clothing while working in the plant ? How can Dr . Walter Krim , the man in charge of finding an antidote of the sting , be the subject of his experiment ? The final solution with the tune of the alarm sound attracting the bees to the ocean completes this shameful flick that wastes an excellent cast . Title ( Brazil ) : " O Enxame " ( " The Swarm " )
Silly , Naive and Dated	While navigating from Rio de Janeiro to Vitória , the stewards Didi ( Renato Aragão ) and Dedé ( Dedé Santana ) and the inexperienced captain of the passenger vessel Anna Neri flirt with a group of models . In the return trip , Didi and Dedé simulate that the ship is sinking , and with another steward , they kidnap the captain and use a liferaft to go to a desert island with four models . But the island is the hidden place of a dangerous gang of smugglers , jeopardizing the group . " A Ilha dos Paqueras " is a silly , naive and dated Brazilian comedy of 1970 . The unique interest in this movie is historical , once shows Renato Aragão and Dedé Santana in the beginning of their career before the successful " Os Trapalhões " . There are also some images of Rio de Janeiro that worth . The DVD released by Cinemagia / Fantasy distributor has an awful quality of image and sound , and in some moments it is impossible to understand the dialogs , but probably the master is damaged . Title ( Brazil ) : " A Ilha dos Paqueras " ( " The Island of the Flirt Men " )
A Collection of Clichés Awfully Dubbed in English	The seven month pregnant Natalia ( Najwa Nimri ) and her wealthy husband Jaime ( Pep Munné ) welcome Natalie's sister Elena ( Ingrid Rubio ) and her boyfriend Mario ( Juan Sanz ) to spend the weekend in their manor . After a miscarriage , Elena proves that is an unbalanced and disturbed woman obsessed to have a baby even if she needs to kill . The terrible " Trastorno " is a collection of clichés awfully dubbed in English . The story is absurdly unreasonable , and the attitudes of Natalia are simply ridiculous ; Ingrid Rubio uses grimaces to express an insane woman ; actually a caricatured character . Why should Natalia invite Elena to stay at her home if she feels scared with her deranged sister ? The corny conclusion is silly . Title ( Brazil ) : " Jogo de Obsessão " ( " Game of Obsession " )
Pure Trash	An airplane carrying a huge snake crashes in a forest , where two lesbian lovers are camping . The python eats both women and leaves their remains destroyed by its acid . The animal moves to a town , threatening the population and leaving the local sheriff and his team astonished . Meanwhile , Dr . Anton Rudolph ( Robert Englund ) , who was developing a weapon based on the acid of the python , discloses to agent Bart Parker ( Casper Van Dien ) how powerful it is . ' Python ' is pure trash : the story is very silly and the dialogs are ridiculous , but there are reasonable special effects and somehow it becomes funny and entertains . If the viewer liked ' Anaconda ' , will certainly love ' Python ' . Title ( Brazil ) : ' Python '
Boring and Confused	In 1937 , the German family Kranz immigrates to the South of Brazil , settling in a hotel in the country . The members of the family are sympathizers of the Nazis and worship Adolf Hitler . One of the young woman of the Kranz was seduced and abused by a SS officer , arriving pregnant , close to the delivery and very disturbed . With the beginning of the war , two young men of the group move back to Germany to join the Nazi forces . After the war , the place becomes a meeting point for Nazi sympathizers , giving support to former Nazis and assisting them to move to Argentina . Eurico ( Carlos Vereza ) , a Brazilian traveling salesman , arrives to the hotel and stays with the Kranz , expecting to be rewarded with hold for helping the Nazi sympathizers . Although awarded in many minor Brazilian Festivals , " Aleluia Gretchen " is a boring movie . Due to the long period covered by the story for the running time of 118 minutes , and the great number of characters , most of them badly developed , the screenplay is very confused . I am a great fan of Brazilian cinema , but I was completely disappointed with this film . Title ( Brazil ) : " Aleluia Gretchen " ( " Hallelujah Gretchen " )
Too Long and Boring	In the late 60's , a couple of teenagers is brutally murdered by a killer while dating nearby a lake in California . This is the beginning of a series of murders , with the criminal sending letters to the newspapers with riddles and promising more murders while the police force and journalists investigate the crimes trying to find suspects . I have recently seen Alexander Bulkley's " The Zodiac " , which is based on the true events of the serial-killer Zodiac , and I found it a reasonable movie . Today I have just watched most of the 158 minutes running time version of David Fincher with my wife and when I did not sleep , I found it painfully long and boring ( my wife agree with my opinion and she slept less than me ) . It is amazing that this overrated movie needs 158 minutes running time to tell the same story that " The Zodiac " tells in 97 minutes . If the viewer has insomnia problem , try to see this film instead of using sleeping pills because it will be more effective . Title ( Brazil ) : " Zodíaco " ( " Zodiac " )
Boring and Forgettable	While returning in Shuttlepod One , Lieutenant Malcolm Reed and Commander Tucker believe that the Enterprise has been destroyed . Without communication and with limited quantity of oxygen , they have no expectation of being rescued in deep space . To make things worse , micro-singularities hit the shuttlepod , damaging it hull and one tank of oxygen , reducing their autonomy to less than three days . " Shuttlepod " is a boring and forgettable episode and certainly the worst episode of the First Season up to now . It is only funny to see that Malcolm has a crush on the gorgeous T'Pol . Title ( Brazil ) : " Nave Auxiliar " ( " Auxiliary Vessel " )
Pointless and Disappointing	A still famous but decadent actor ( Morgan Freeman ) has not filmed for four years . When he is invited to participate in a new project , he asks the clumsy cousin of the director to drop him in a poor Latin neighborhood in Carlson to research the work of the manager of a small supermarket . He sees the gorgeous Spanish cashier Scarlet ( Paz Vega ) and he becomes attracted with her ability . His driver never returns to catch him and Scarlet gives a ride to the actor . But first she has a job interview for the position of secretary in a construction company and the actor helps her to be prepared ; then they spend the afternoon together having a pleasant time . I am a big fan of Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega . However , the pointless " 10 Items or Less " is absolutely disappointing . This low-budget movie does not seem to have a storyline , and is supported by the chemistry and improvisations of Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega and actually nothing happens along 82 minutes . The ambiguous open conclusion is simply ridiculous , with the character of Morgan Freeman returning to his silver spoon world and telling the simple worker that they would never see each other again . Was he afraid to have a love affair with her and destroy his perfect world with his family ? Or was a clash of classes , and he realizes that his fancy neighborhood would not be adequate to a simple worker from the lower classes ? Title ( Brazil ) : " Um Astro em Minha Vida " ( " A Star in My Life " )
' Near Dark ' + ' Lost Boys ' + ' Angel ' + ' Buffy ' = Forgettable Vampire Movie	Viktoria ( Marisa Ryan ) and Alicia ( Amy Jo Johnson ) are ' good ' vampires and together with Darius ( John Huertas ) are close friends living in a coastal American city . When the newcomer Seth ( Robert Floyd ) arrives , he has a crush on Viktoria . Charles ( Christopher Wiehl ) , a ' bad ' vampire , does not like the proximity of Seth and Viktoria , and decides to disturb Seth with his gang . A great surprise waits for Charles in the end of the plot . This story is not original , being a blending of ' Near Dark ' , with ' Lost Boys ' , plus ' Angel ' and ' Buffy ' . The result is not totally bad , but in the end , it is just a forgettable vampire movie . There is a scene , supposed to be funny , in the middle of the credits , when two guards find the remains full of blood of the two dead vampires . Why these vampires were not converted into dust ? Further , why Viktoria was able to walk in the sun , only with minors burns ? Title ( Brazil ) : ' Filhos das Trevas ' ( ' Sons of the Darkness ' )
Disappointing Return	While working in a hospital treating a boy with terminal Sandhoff Disease , Doctor Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) is visited by FBI Agent Moslet ( Xzibit ) that is seeking out Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) to help the FBI in the chase of a missing agent . In return , the FBI would drop all the charges against Mulder . Mulder accepts the assignment and meets with Agent Dakota Whitney ( Amanda Peet ) , who is in charge of the investigations , using the leads of the psychic Father Joseph Crissman ( Billy Connolly ) , who is accused of pedophilia against thirty-seven altar boys . Father Joe claims that he has visions sent by God ; while Mulder wants to believe in his visions , the skeptical Scully loathes him . Duting their investigations , Mulder and Scully discover that there is a new Dr . Frankenstein using human parts in his experiment . I am a great fan of " The X-Files " series , but this movie is a disappointing return of the cult Scully and Mulder . The first negative point of this awful story is the absurd campaign against the Catholic Church . I have no religion , but it is disgusting to see a pedophile priest ; an unscrupulous Catholic priest in the direction of the hospital where Scully works ; and the subtle message with the name of the terminal boy called Christian together in the same movie , in a total lack of respect to the Catholic believers . The story of this modern Dr . Frankenstein is weird and inconsistent , with many flaws . Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny show no chemistry along the story and their kiss is depressing . Last but not the least , most ( or all ) characters are unpleasant and non-charismatic . It would be better of leaving Scully and Mulder retired . Mt vote is five . Title ( Brazil ) : " Arquivo X ? Eu Quero Acreditar " ( " X-Files ? I Want to Believe " )
Absurd , Corny , Incoherent and Overrated	The rancher Daniel Evans ( Christian Bale ) , who lost part of his leg in the Civil War , is broken and owing a large amount to a powerful man in Bisbee . When the outlaw Ben Wade ( Russell Crowe ) is captured after the heist of a stagecoach , Dan offers to escort the cold blood killer to the city of Contention to take the 3 : 10 PM train to Yuma to be sent to trial . In return , he would receive US$ 200 , 00 , enough to save his land and give a better life to his family . During their journey , Ben gets closer to Dan while his gang of criminals follows the group to rescue their boss . The deceptive " 3 : 10 to Yuma " has an absurd and incoherent plot and is absolutely overrated in IMDb . Indeed I can not understand how many viewers do not see how illogical this movie is ( maybe influenced by the positive marketing ) . I am a big fan of Christian Bale , I like Russell Crowe a lot , and actually their performances are top-notch as usual . Regarding the Hollywoodian bad guy Ben Wade , he is a cold blood killer and leader of mean criminals . However , along their journey , he has feelings for Dan in a ridiculously corny situation ; he runs and jumps over the roofs and alleys without any explanation to help Dan to reach the station ; in the climax , he kills his own loyal men that had risked their lives to save him . Regarding Dan Evans , he leaves his wife and sons in a dangerous trip just to raise money ; however , he neither accepts the offer of Ben ( ok , it would be corruption and not compatible to a good guy ) nor the money of the railroad agent when they are under siege in the hotel with a dreadful perspective of survival . Last but not the least , he runs and jumps very well with only one foot . Why the good guy did not kill the arrogant and cruel Ben Wade along the incidental trip ? Maybe the most ridiculous situation is Byron McElroy ( Peter Fonda ) , who was shot in the stomach , riding a horse on the next day . Title ( Brazil ) : " Os Indomáveis " ( " The Indomitable " )
Silly with an Absurd Storyline	When the bee Barry B . Benson graduates from college , he finds that will have only one job for his entire life , and absolutely disappointed , he joins the team responsible for bringing the honey and pollination of the flowers to visit the world outside the hive . Once in Manhattan , he is saved by the florist Vanessa and he breaks the bee law to thank Vanessa . The become friends and Barry discovers that humans explore bees to sell the honey they produce . Barry decides to sue the human race , with destructive consequences to nature . " Bee Movie " has a great animation , but unfortunately is silly with an absurd storyline . I do not understand what the writer might have in his mind with such lack of message ; maybe a child could have written a better and more intelligent plot . The lead character in funny but has an annoying voice . I love animations , especially those with good messages . However , is so inaccurate and stupid that even for children I believe this movie does not work well . Title ( Brazil ) : " Bee Movie ? A História de Uma Abelha " ( " Bee Movie ? The Story of a Bee " )
Why This Boring Remake of a Classic Comedy ?	The 1955 " Ladykillers " is a great sarcastic black humor British comedy , with five elegant small-time thieves and an irritating old lady . This version of the Coen brothers brought the same story to the Mississipi , changed the armored car by a casino and lost all the glamour of the original movie . I do not know how American viewers feel regarding the accent of Mississipi and the behavior of the locals , but for me it is very boring . Tom Hanks is excellent , as usual , but for those who have appreciate the original movie , I believe it is impossible to like this remake . Title ( Brazil ) : " Matadores de Velhinha " ( " Old Lady Killers " )
Meeting the Future	The Enterprise needs to cross a subspace corridor protected by the hostiles Kavalans to arrive on time to the meeting with the Xindi council scheduled by Degra . However , the ship is surprisingly stopped by another Enterprise from the future with the descendants of the original crew-members . Lorian , the captain and son of Trip and T'Pol , explains that the original Enterprise was sent one hundred and seventeen years back in time while escaping from the Kavalans through the corridor , and they want to help the Enterprise to succeed and accomplish her mission at any cost . " E2 " is a flawed episode , where the only explanation for the holes in the screenplay is the Expanse , where the laws of physics and time are different . T'Pol alive and the duplicate Enterprise together with the original T'Pol and Enterprise are absolutely incoherent and I did not like this unnecessary and forgettable episode . Title ( Brazil ) : " Enterprise 2 "
A Reasonable Sequel	In Japan , the daycare teacher Kyoko Okudera ( Mimura ) is convinced by her colleague and friend Madoka to visit her boyfriend Naoto Sakurai ( Yû Yoshizawa ) in the restaurant where he works instead of studying as planned . When the owner Mr . Wang answers the cellular call of his daughter , he receives a message telling that he would die in an accident in the kitchen that immediately comes true . Later , Naoto is visited by the snoopy journalist Takako Nozoe ( Asaka Seto ) , who is researching the death call , and she plays the deadly ring tone for him . He recalls that not only Mr . Wang , but also Madoka have received similar calls . Meanwhile Kyoko is talking to Madoka and she sees a ghost in her phone . She rushes to Madoka's apartment and finds her dead in the bathtub , with Naoto and Takako arriving immediately after . Their investigation shows that Mimiko's grandfather Wei Zhang is in Taiwan and Takako asks her former husband Yuting to search him . Meanwhile , Kyoko receives a phone call and the autopsies of Mr . Wang and Madoka indicate the presence of coal dust in their lungs and no candies in their mouths . Takako , Naoto and Kyoko travel to Taiwan expecting to solve the mystery and save Kyoko from her fate . " Chakushin Ari 2 " is scary like most of the Asian horror movies , and has a promising beginning supported by a good sequel of Takashi Miike's " Chakushin Ari " . I saw both movies in sequence and I found many explanations about characters and situations of the first movie . However , like in the first story , the conclusion the movie is confused , not clear , needing interpretation of the pretentious plot point that contradicts the whole plot and character development ; therefore , the screenplay writer Minako Daira or the director Renpei Tsukamoto or both failed since they were not able to transmit a clear conclusion of the story to the audience . Title ( Brazil ) : " Uma Chamada Perdida 2 " ( " One Missed Call 2 " )
American Reality	The American daughter of missionaries Lana ( Michelle Williams ) returns to Los Angeles from Palestine to work in a mission helping homeless people . Lana was born in Ohio and raised in South Africa and Middle East , and she is an authentic citizen of the world , connected through Internet and aware of how other people see the lack of culture and knowledge and exaggerated patriotism of average American people . Her unique relative is her unknown uncle Paul ( John Diehl ) , a veteran of Vietnam War that cut relationships with his family and is bigot and paranoid . Paul lives in a surveillance van , lives as if he were a secret agent , sees conspiracy and terrorist cells everywhere , and has a great prejudice against Arabs and other non-American breeds after the September , 11th . They meet each other , and when they see the murder of a poor Pakistanis nearby the mission , they travel together to the small town of Trone to deliver his corpse to the family , where Paul sees a different reality . " Land of Plenty " is a very well acted low budget movie , with great performances of Michelle Williams and John Diehl . Wim Wenders tries to picture the reality of North America unknown for foreigners and even common Americans , with homeless and alienated people living with fear , angst and prejudice , totally disconnected of the world , instead of the land of opportunities and plenty of the American Dream shown in most of the American movies . In this regard , he is very well succeeded , but in my opinion I found the character of Paul absolutely exaggerated , using many apparatuses and gadgets in his " work " . The beautiful and shining character of Michelle Williams gives the hope that the world can be a better place someday . Title ( Brazil ) : " Medo e Obsessão " ( " Fear and Obsession " )
Reasonable Idea , Terrible Screenplay	The veteran agent of the American secret service Pete Garrison ( Michael Douglas ) saved the life of president Ronald Reagan in the past and became a legend . Presently he is responsible for the personal security of the American president Ballentine ( David Rasche ) and the first lady Sarah Ballentine ( Kim Bassinger ) , with whom he is having a love affair . When his informer Walter discloses that there is a traitor in the secret service and a plot to kill the president , his former friend David Breckinridge ( Kiefer Sutherland ) and the chief of the secret service William Montrose ( Martin Donovan ) are in charge of the investigation and all the agents are submitted to a polygraph test . Due to his situation with Sarah , he is compromised with the results and accused of treachery . He escapes , and in spite of chased by the secret service , he conducts his own investigation trying to find the responsible . " The Sentinel " has a reasonable idea , of an agent failing in the polygraph test due to his love affair with the first lady , but the screenplay does not have any care for the characters . The running time should be longer and not waste in so many exaggerated details relative to the protection of the American president , and give more attention to the characters . In the end , the story is conventional , badly resolved and with bureaucratic performances of the good cast . Title ( Brazil ) : " Sentinela " ( " Sentinel " )
Funny and Entertaining	While heading to Galveston in a RV for the wedding of a friend , the driver Johnny ( Oz Perkins ) gets lost and arrive in the small town of Lovelock and his friends Kate ( Bianca Lawson ) , Sara ( Ever Carradine ) , Melody ( Gina Phillips ) , Christian ( Jeremy Sisto ) and David ( Erik Palladino ) decide to spend the night in the Bed and Breakfast owned by Mr . Robert Wise ( David Carradine ) . David has an argument with the chef of the inn , Henri ( Diedrich Bader ) , and when the chef is found dead and Mr . Wise has a heart attack in the middle of the night , the local Sheriff ( Jeffrey Dean Morgan ) suspects of the group and asks his assistant Enus ( Mark Kelly ) to take the key of their trailer and stay in Lovelock during the investigation . Then the Sheriff arrests a drifter ( Brent David Fraser ) that becomes his prime suspect . When the clumsy Johnny accidentally breaks a box of Mr . Wise , he releases the fiend Kuman Thong and the evil spirit possesses the locals transforming them into zombies . Matthew Leutwyler certainly wrote and directed " Dead & Breakfast " with the intention of making a cult-movie . Unfortunately his target is never reached , but this gore comedy is funny and a worthwhile entertainment . There are good lines and most of the characters are likable , and one of the best moments if the phone call of the maid of honor Kate to the bride Lisa , with a hilarious dialog . Title ( Brazil ) : " Adivinhe Quem Vem Para Morrer " ( " Guess Who is Coming to Die ? " )
Having Such Soldiers Presented in Movies Like That , How Americans Lost the Vietnam War ?	Col . Cal Rhodes ( Gene Hackman ) is a father who does not accept the loss of his son Frank in Vietnam . Frank was considered ' missing in action ' . He tries to gather evidences that his son is alive and is a ' pow ' ( prisoner of war ) . He does not convince Washington and decides to reunite other veteran ex-militaries and organize a raid in the field in Laos where Frank is supposed to be arrested . With the financial support of MacGregor ( Robert Stack ) , a wealthy father in the same situation as Rhodes , they prepare a small but experienced team for the action . First of all , I do not like this type of movie . It offends my intelligence . The usual arithmetic works this way : the life of Blaster + Sailor + two Asians > the freedom of four deranged and very sick prisoners . Further , having such soldiers like presented in movies like that , how Americans lost the Vietnam war ? Anyway , the action is great and entertains and at least the author made a decent end . Title ( Brazil ) : ' De Volta ao Inferno ' ( ' Back to Hell ' )
Just-Married	Melinda Gordon has seen , heard and talked to ghosts since she was a child with the guidance of her grandmother , helping spirits to cross to the other side . On her wedding day with the paramedic Jim Clancy , the ghost of Sergeant Paul Adams , who was missing in action in Vietnam , comes to her , asking Melinda to contact his son Michael Adams . Michael believes Melinda is a fraud , but when his wife forces him to call the Pentagon giving the leads Melinda gave them , the army finds the remains of his father . The pilot-episode of " Ghost Whisperer " promises an interesting series supported by the sweet Jennifer Love Hewitt . The simple story is beautiful , but predictable and without any surprises or twists . It is difficult to understand why the soldier of a war of the 60's and 70's has expected so many years to contact Melinda . Title ( Brazil ) : " Pilot "
Trapped in the Mind of a Serial Killer	While chasing the serial killer Conrad Phibes ( Patrick Kilpatrick ) in a flower shop , Detective Burke ( Jeff Doucette ) shoots him in the head under the protest of his partner Detective Fusco ( Romy Rosemont ) . Conrad enters in a deep coma and is near death , and Fusco seeks out Dr . Nathan Bradford ( Bruce Greenwood ) . She explains that Conrad has killed many red-haired women with blue eyes and his last victim , Rochelle Davis ( Dorion Davis ) , has not been found yet and might be alive . Kate Russell ( Naomi Watts ) decides to lure Conrad , painting her hair and wearing contact lens , and enters in his mind with Ben Costigan ( Jeffrey D . Samms ) trying to find the destiny of Rochelle . However , the evil killer has his tricks and the plan does not succeed , jeopardizing Kate's safety and sanity . This episode was released in Brazil in a single DVD with " Pilot " . However , the story is disappointing and confusing , maybe because there are many episodes missing . There are terrible and shameful mistakes in Brazilian title and the original title on the cover of the Brazilian DVD . Title ( Brazil ) : " Entre o Bem e o Mal ? Quando a Realidade Termina " ( " Between the Good and Evil ? When the Reality Ends " )
Disappointing Lack of Ethics	While running in the campaign to the senate , Jonathan hires Lois as his adviser . Meanwhile , his opponent Lex is visited by a group of fans leaded by the fanatic Samantha Drake , and the deranged woman threatens the safety of Jonathan . Lana discusses with Clark their sex life , and Clark exposes his innermost fears to Chloe . Lionel eliminates the dossier Griff has prepared to Lex and offers his financial support to Martha . I did not like this episode since the disappointing lack of ethics of Martha Kent spoils the integrity of the Kent family . One of the best things " Smallville " offers to the fans are the moral values of Clark , raised by a simple but honest family , explaining how he would become the greatest American ( and why not worldwide ? ) hero . However , the behavior of Martha accepting the support of the greatest villain of the show , the Machiavellian Lionel Luthor , is absolutely inconsistent with her character . The good moment is the discussion of Clark and Chloe about his sexual relationship and fears with Lois . But unfortunately I was upset with the amoral attitude of Martha . If Lex read the Art of War , it seems that Martha read The Prince . Title ( Brazil ) : " Fanática " ( " Fanatic " )
Unborn Demoniac Baby	Phoebe has nightmares during the night , and her unborn baby begins to control her body attacking Paige or any threat to his safety . Meanwhile , in the underworld , the ambitious The Seer convinces the demoniac council to postpone the coronation of Dane while she plots to steal the baby to become the new Source . In this reasonable episode , the evil The See uses her powerful magic trying to be the new Source , but the Halliwell sisters prove that the Power of Three is invincible . With the underworld lords destroyed , who might be the next enemy of the Charmed Ones ? Title ( Brazil ) : " O Bebê de Phoebe " ( " The Baby of Phoebe " )
A Very Reasonable Film-Noir	Detective Tom Chaney ( Jeff Fahey ) is a lonely man , having a new partner , the gay Detective Rod Lambeau ( Carl Marotte ) . They are investigating two similar murders in Manhattan , and their main suspect is the successful prosecutor Katy Wesson ( Marlee Matlin ) . During the investigations , Tom and Katy fall in love for each other . However , the lack of trust of Tom on Katty leads to a series of problems . The end of the story reveals many secrets . This film-noir is very reasonable , but something is missing in the story to be an excellent movie . The screenplay really need some improvement . Marlee Martin is very expressive and has a good performance . Jeff Fahey and Carl Marotte are also good as two colleagues who learn to respect each other . Anyway , it is a worthwhile entertainment and hooks the attention of the viewer . This is the second time that I watch this movie and I do not regret . The IMDB User Rating of 4 . 1 is unfair . Title ( Brazil ) : ' Assassinato em Manhattan ' ( ' Murder in Manhattan ' )
Lost in Stall	Jack is not feeling well believing that it was fruit poisoning ; however Juliet finds that he needs an emergency appendectomy , otherwise he would die . Meanwhile , in a " flashforward " , Jack is living with Kate and Aaron and proposes her . However , the deranged Hurley questions to Jack whether they are not dead in heaven , and later Jack sees his father , Dr . Christian Shephard . While heading to Jack's camp , Sawyer , Claire and Aaron and Miles meet Frank Lapidus that advises them to hide from Keamy and his men . In the morning , Claire has vanished and Miles tells that she had woken up in the middle of the night calling for her father . " Something Nice Back Home " is a reasonable episode that unfortunately goes nowhere . There is only one new mystery , with the presence of Dr . Christian Shephard , and once again there is an absolute lack of answers for the countless mysteries . After watching this " stalled " show I question again whether these successive breaks in this series do not indicate that the writers are unable to resolve the issues raised along the three successful first seasons .

Vagina Dentata ? One of the Most Refreshing Horror Tales	In a small town nearby a nuclear power facility , the chaste Dawn ( Jess Weixler ) is raised with her dysfunctional stepbrother Brad ( John Hensley ) by her mother that is sick and her stepfather . Once in high school , she participates of a meeting called " The Promise O " that preaches purity and virginity for the members . When the newcomer Tobey ( Hale Appleman ) arrives in town , the naive Dawn feels that he is her soul mate and stays close to him . The proximity becomes attraction and Tobey does not control his hormones and forces Dawn to have intercourse with him in a cave in an isolated lake . However , he is castrated by her vagina and vanishes in the lake . The desperate Dawn runs to the library and discovers that she has the mythical " Vagina Dentata " and only a hero can rescue her . " Teeth " is one of the most refreshing horror tales that I have recently seen . The story of a chaste teenager that finds that she has a " Vagina Dentata " is simply hilarious and surrealistic . The legend does really exist , and in accordance with the Wikipedia ( http en wikipedia org wiki Vagina dentata ) " various cultures have folk tales about women with toothed vaginas , frequently told as cautionary tales warning of the dangers of sex with strange women and to discourage the act of rape " . There could be also a subtle interpretation that could be the difficulty of Dawn to self-adjust to the womanhood , but I believe the intention of the author was simply uses the myth to make a gem of dark humor . The beauty of the sweet Jess Weixler is awesome . Title ( Brazil ) : Not available
Crossing the Line of Ethics	The Reptilians stop the attack to the Enterprise that is stranded seriously damaged , without propulsion and with many casualties . Captain Archer is sent back in an aquatic pod and evaluates the damage report . When a ship with problems caused by the anomalies hails the Enterprise , Archer proposes to trade their warp engine by Trellium and supplies , but the other captain does not accept the offer . When Archer decodes Degra's message calling him to a meeting with the Xindi council scheduled in three days , Archer decides to use force and take the warp coil by force from the aliens . Meanwhile T'Pol goes to the sick bay and tells Dr . Phlox that she is addicted in Trellium and unable to control her emotions . In " Damage " , Captain Archer crosses the line of ethics and steals the warp engine of an alien ship using the maximum that the end justifies the means that recalls the behavior of many governors of the Twentieth and the Twentieth Centuries that think in the same way . I personally hated this despicable episode and I believe the author could have written a better action to be taken considering the moral character of Archer . I do not agree with the destruction of his moral and ethical principles in such easy way . In the rest , the saga of the Enterprise goes on , but not as noble as it has been along the other seventy episodes . Title ( Brazil ) : " Relatório de Danos " ( " Damage Reports " )
Time Travelers From the Future	The Enterprise encounters an alien spacecraft with amicable aliens that will watch the Great Plume of Agosoria , a phenomenon considered religious by them that happen every eleven years , and Archer invite the group to come on board of Enterprise . When a plasma storm hits Enterprise , there is a miracle interrupting a serious cascade failure , preventing the reactor breach and explosion of Enterprise , and Trip finds that someone of the alien group disconnected a cable saving Enterprise . Later , the crewman Daniels tells Archer that he is a time traveler that has come from the future to chase the Sulliban soldier Silik , his opponent in a temporal cold war . " Cold Front " is an engaging episode of this series , but the explanation of Daniels and his motives are very confused . I confess that in the end I did not understand why Silik was the enemy , and why he saved the Enterprise from blowing up . Title ( Brazil ) : " Frente Fria " ( " Cold Front " )
Loneliness and Companion	In Enterprise , Hoshi has the sensation of being observed , and when an alien entity contacts her , she calls Reed that does not locate any stranger on board . Hoshi asks Dr . Phlox to examine her , but then she finds that a telepathic alien is inviting her to visit his planet . In return , he would use his abilities to seek the Xindis and where they are building their weapon . Hoshi meets Tarquin , who is four hundred year-old , and lives in exile because his society does not accept his telepathic power , and finds his real intentions in contacting her . Meanwhile T'Pol discovers that there is a second sphere , and she tries to map its position to foresee the location of the anomalies generated by the devices . " Exile " is an episode centered in Hoshi Sato , with an alien being outcast by his society and forced to live in exile due to his abilities . The idea is not original and the motives of the lonely Tarquin are predictable , and in the end " Exile " is only a reasonable episode . Title ( Brazil ) : " Exílio " ( " Exile " )
A Code of Behavior	After two weeks in space , the only contact of the Enterprise's crew has been with a dying worm . Lieutenant Malcolm Reed is trying to align the scanners of the defense system with the support of Ensign Travis Mayweather ; Dr . Phlox is researching a slug and a bat that have been brought aboard ; Ensign Hoshi Sato is bored and feeling upset for the slug . When Enterprise sees a spacecraft adrift in space , Captain Jonathan Archer decides to go on board with Reed and Hoshi to contact the crew , but they find fifteen dead crewman . Sub-Commander T'Pol advises to leave the place for the safety of the Enterprise and crew . After an argument with T'Pol about code of behavior . Captain Archer decides to return to the craft with Dr . Phlox , Ensign Hoshi and the engineer Reed , and make contact with the planet of the crewman . Dr . Phlox finds that a component of the body of the aliens has been drained by the killers , and they are surprised by the spaceship that has killed the crew . When the situation is dramatic and critical , Hoshi contacts another craft from the breed that had been murdered , the Axanar . " Fight or Flight " is a reasonable episode of Enterprise with a greater participation of the insecure Hoshi . T'Pol is more restraint by Captain Archer , but her advices are sensate and wise , contrasting with the impulsive Captain Archer . The preoccupation with the slug is silly , and the attitude of leaving the worm in another planet is irresponsible with the environment . Title ( Brazil ) : " Luta ou Fuga " ( " Fight or Runaway " )
A Person Is a Person No Matter How Small	In the jungle of Nool , the elephant Horton hears a voice in a speck ; he uses a clover to rescue the speck of dust and he makes contact with the Mayor of Whoville . Horton discovers that in that tiny speck there is a city crowded of people and he decides to leave Whoville in a safe place . However , the evil Kangaroo does not believe in his words and finds Horton dangerous for the children of Nool , making them believe in what they can not see , hear or feel , and incites the animals against Horton . With the message " A Person Is a Person No Matter How Small " , " Horton Hears a Who ! " is a lesson of respect and rights of the minorities through hilarious situations . The animation is awesome , the characters are nice and I liked this great family entertainment . Title ( Brazil ) : " Horton e o Mundo dos Quem ! " ( " Horton and the World of Who ! " )
A Surprisingly Good Plot to Remember the Movies from the 50's	Dr . Jenniffer Stillman ( the gorgeous Nastassja Kinski ) is a school psychologist from N . Y . that moves to her new job in a small American town . There she will meet Benjamin James McCann ( Bobby Edner ) , a boy with a powerful mind , and some strange citizens that live under the shadow of a mysterious event in the past . I am a great fan of those Universal Classic Monster movies from the 50's , such as ' The Creature from The Black Lagoon ' , ' The Wolf Man ' , ' Frankenstein ' , ' The Invisible Man ' etc . ' The Day the World Ended ' look like one of those movies from the 50's . It seems that the director and the screenplay writer wanted to honor those movies . Further , it could be used as a ' X-Files ' episode . There are clichés , the special effects are very poor , but it has a charm . It is a Sci-Fi / Horror movie without explicit violence that entertains . It deserves to be watched . Title ( Brazil ) : " O Dia Que o Mundo Acabou " ( " The Day the World Ended " )
Delightful Homage to a Great TV Series	In Transylvania , a raged crowd expels the Munster family from their castle . While escaping from the villagers , Herman ( Edward Herrmann ) finds a piece of a letter from his sister Elsa Munster Hyde ( Judy Gold ) and his brother-in-law Norman Hyde ( Max Grodénchik ) from North America and the family decides to travel to California . When they meet their niece Marilyn ( Christine Taylor ) , they are informed that Norman is missing and his wife is in coma due to her loss . On the next days , the Munster family faces problem with the adaptation in the new country : Lily ( Veronica Hamel ) meets her snoopy neighbors ; Grandpa ( Robert Morse ) researches in the laboratory a cure for Elsa and finds a videotape that shows what has happened with Norman ; and Eddie ( Matthew Botuchis ) goes to the school and has problem with the local bully . When the candidate to the Senate Brent Jeckyll ( Jeff Trachta ) arrives in the location in campaign , Grandpa discloses the truth about the past of the bigoted candidate . " Here Come the Munsters " is a delightful homage to a great TV series . The gags are hilarious , a journey to my childhood , and the cameo appearance of Yvonne de Carlo , Al Lewis , Butch Patrick and Pat Priest is a plus in this funny , but unfortunately underrated , movie . Title ( Brazil ) : " Os Monstros Estão de Volta " ( " The Monsters Are Back " )
Although Full of Clichés , a Good Horror Movie	Chris Flynn ( Desmond Harrington ) is driving his car for a job interview in another city . However , an accident with a trunk transporting chemical products blocks the highway and Chris looks for an alternative route through the mountains of West Virginia to accomplish his schedule . Due to a lack of attention , he crashes another car parked in the middle of the road with flat tires . Chris meets a group of five friends , who intended to camp in the forest , and they decide to leave the couple Francine ( Lindy Booth ) and Evan ( Kevin Zegers ) on the place , while Chris , Jessie ( Eliza ' Faith ' Dushku ) , Carly ( Emmanuelle Chrisqui ) and her fiancé Scott ( Jeremy ' Billy Six Feet Under ' Sisto ) tries to find some help . They find a weird cabin in the middle of nowhere , where three violent cannibalistic mountain men with the appearance of monsters live . The two couples try to escape from the mountain men while chased by them . ' Wrong Turn ' is a kind of mixture of ' The Texas Chainsaw Massacre ' , ' Deliverance ' and ' Jeepers Creepers ' plus a collection of clichés of the genre . However , the blending is surprisingly good and hooks the attention of the viewer until the last scene . The great young cast , leaded by the gorgeous Eliza Dushku , is very attractive and performs a great job . I liked this movie a lot . Title ( Brazil ) : ' Pânico na Floresta ' ( ' Panic in the Forest ' )
A Surprisingly Good B-Movie , With a Transformation of a Man into a Spider , Which Slightly Recalls " The Fly "	Quentin Kemmer ( Devon Gummersall ) is a shy and coward security guard and a passionate collector of comic books , who lives in a junkie building and has a crush on his next-door neighbor , the nurse Stephanie Lewis ( Amelia Heinle ) . However , he is too shy to declare his love for or invite her for a date . He works in a laboratory , which is studying and trying to develop a secret genetic weapon using the power and skills of the spiders . When the laboratory is robbed and his partner and great friend is killed with other persons by the criminals , Quentin feels under pressure with the situation and decides to inject himself the experimental vaccine . In the beginning , his strength and abilities increase and he feels like an arachnid superhero from his magazines . However , a couple of days later , he begins to transform himself into a giant spider-man hybrid , capable of throwing webs through his abdomen , developing claws in his mouth and prevailing the instincts and a non-stop hunger of the spiders over his will . Meanwhile , Quentin eliminates many persons , and Detective Jack Grillo ( Dan Aykroyd ) investigates the series of mysterious deaths in the neighborhood . " Spider Vs . Earth " is a surprisingly good B-movie that recalls the horror and sci-fi stories of the 50's . The plot is good , with the exception of the unnecessary participation of Theresa Russell , in the role of an adultery and drunken wife . The slow transformation of Quentin into a spider slightly recalls the dramatic situation of " The Fly " . My true and honest opinion is that the IMDb User Rating is totally unfair with this film . I bought the VHS and I do not regret . Title ( Brazil ) : " A Maldição da Aranha " ( " The Curse of the Spider " )
Respect the Dead	The former friends Harris ( Dominic Purcell ) , Kira ( Josie Maran ) and Sid ( Marcus Thomas ) reunite for drinking after the funeral service of an old friend that died in a car accident . When the bar closes , Sid proposes to go to the Cresent View Cemetery to say farewell to his friend and drink more . Once there , Sid finds a letter in a tombstone , reads it and they dance on three graves . On the next days , weird things happen in the house of Harris and his wife Allison ( Clare Kramer ) , but Allison believes it is Kira , who has a crush on Harris , stalking them . They go to Kira's house and find her wounded in a completely destroyed place . Later Sid calls them and they are introduced to the paranormal investigators Vincent Cochet ( Tcheky Kayro ) and Frances ( Megahn Perry ) , who tell them that Sid read an ancient spell that cursed the trio and brought back the ghosts of the graves from the damned sector of the cemetery where they danced . He also discloses that Harris and Allison are being haunted by an insane ax murderer pianist ; Kira by a sadistic rapist ; and Sid by a pyromaniac . They have to break the curse or survive for an entire cycle of the full moon when the curse would finish , while the ghosts are getting stronger and stronger . Yesterday I saw " The Gravedancers " on cable and I really liked this horror movie . The supernatural ghost story is original and scary , having right doses of humor and funny moments , and the acting is reasonable . This is the first time that I see the idea of bringing ghosts back from hell through the disrespect to the grave of the dead , and I found it great . This movie is highly recommended to fans of the genre . Title ( Brazil ) : " Carta Para a Morte " ( " Letter to the Death " )
A Suspenseful Adventure Enhanced by the Music of Tangerine Dream	Bobby Logan ( Kris Kristofferson ) and Ernie Wyatt ( Treat Williams ) are Texas border officers working in the area of San Antonio . They both are threatened of loosing their jobs due to the utilization of a type of underground radars to locate illegal immigrants from Mexico . One day , Bobby finds a buried 1962 jeep , with a skeleton , a rifle and a wallet with US$ 800 , 000 . 00 ( in 1984 ? it was lots of money ) in bills of 1962 and 1963 and shares this discover with his pal Ernie . These findings will jeopardize their lives , and this situation will long until the last scene of this suspenseful movie . A great thriller and adventure , that has traces of ' The X-Files ' , with a mystery and conspiracy in the government without a conclusive end . Further , this movie is extremely enhanced by the music of Tangerine Dream .
With a Better Story and Less Special Effects , Might Be a Great Film	I really had a great expectation with " Kingdom of Heaven " : beginning with the name of Ridley Scott , one of the greatest directors of Hollywood , the awesome cast and last but not the least the very high budget available for the production . Unfortunately , the confused flawed unreasonable story does not work well , and in the end I was disappointed . Balian ( Orlando Bloom ) , the lead character , is a blacksmith and bastard son of a noble , Godfrey ( Liam Neeson ) , that is going to Jerusalem and discloses to Balian that he is his father and invites Balian to join him in his journey . In the end of the story , Balian is absurdly a great strategist and leader as if he had a military formation . There are so many holes and inconsistencies along the screenplay that irritated me that I would make a long list , and certainly it would be incomplete . The excessive use of special effects is also awful , and when Jerusalem is bombed by the Muslims , I recalled the recent bombing of Iraq . The quantity of warriors looks like ants in an anthill , and the excessive splash of blood in the battles would be joyful for a vampire , but I found of a totally bad taste . The cinematography and the performances of the actors are excellent , and it was good to see the gorgeous Eva Green , from " The Dreamers " , again . " Kingdom of Heaven " with a better story and less special effects might be a great film ; the way it is , it is only a reasonable and forgettable entertainment . Title ( Brazil ) : " Cruzada " ( " Cruzade " )
Greed , Death and Murder	In the country of Drees County , the widow hard worker John Munn ( Dermot Mulroney ) lives in a simple rural isolated property with his rebel and troubled son Chris ( Jamie Bell ) and his sick son Tin ( Devon Alan ) and no friends . When his brother Deel Munn ( Josh Lucas ) unexpectedly arrives in his house on probation , John welcomes him . However , the real intentions of Deel lead the family to a tragedy , forcing the boys to leave home . " Undertow " is a low paced movie , with a short story , great development of characters and excellent performances . There are no big surprises along the story and in spite of the introduction of the film inducing that it is based on a true event , I have not found any reference in Internet about this murder . Title ( Brazil ) : " Contra Corrente " ( " Undertow " )
Another Delightful Romantic Comedy with Meg Ryan	Leopold ( Hugh Jackson ) is an English and broken baron living in New York in the end of the Nineteenth Century . He needs to get married with a rich fiancée to recover his family position from ruin . Kate ( Meg Ryan ) is a successful businesswoman living also in New York , but in 2001 . Due to a time incident , they meet each other in the present days and ( guess what ? ) they fall in love to each other . This is another delightful romantic comedy . In this field , Meg Ryan is outstanding . The plot has many inconsistencies : the time travel is not explained , the problem with the elevators ( why have they worked again ? ) , the interest of Stuart in Leopold in the past ( in the deleted scenes , there is a reference that Leopold and Stuart are relatives ) , how Kate , with her profile of stressed executive , would survive in the past only with love . . . But , anyway , forget these questions , be romantic , and this movie will be an entertainment for the whole family . Title ( Brazil ) : " Kate & Leopold "
The Father's Sin	In Denmark , A . D . 507 , the realm of King Hrothgar ( Anthony Hopkins ) is threatened by the tormented demon Grendel ( Crispin Glover ) that attacks the locals in their celebrations . The Danish king offers a reward for the death of the creature , attracting to Herot the brave Geet warrior Beowulf ( Ray Winstone ) that seeks for glory . After a fierce battle , Beowulf defeats the demon and after receiving an old relic as reward , he finds his men slaughtered in the party saloon of the castle . King Hrothgar advises that the Grendel's mother ( Angelina Jolie ) was the responsible for the bloodshed and Beowulf chases her in the lake where she lives . The creature takes the form of a seductive woman and seduces Beowulf with a promise of becoming an invincible and wealthy king if he makes love to her and gives his golden relic to her . Years later , King Beowulf feels the aftermath of his sin . " Beowulf " is a dark tale in an age in the beginning of the Christianity and a unique experience with the entire movie made of computer-generated image ( CGI ) . There is no live action , but the stylization of the characters and images is amazing . In accordance with the director Robert Zemeckis , this resource allowed to make this movie with lower costs , using unusual movements of camera . There are silly moments , like for example Beowulf fighting completely naked against Grendel , or the ambiguous character of Unferth , but in the end this movie is entertaining . I only imagine how frustrating might be for actors and actresses performing in blue screen without interaction or set . Title ( Brazil ) : " A Lenda de Beowulf " ( " The Legend of Beowulf " )
A Very Funny Parody of 007 Movies	Johnny English ( Rowan Atkinson ) is a bureaucratic employee of the British Secret Service , who dreams to be a charming agent . His dreams come true when all the British agents die , due to the lack of security in a funeral where he was the responsible . Johnny English , with the support of his assistant Bough ( Ben Miller ) and Lorna Campbell ( Natalie Imbruglia ) , fights against the evil Pascal Sauvage ( John Malkovitch ) , a powerful French who wants to be the king of the United Kingdom and transforms England in a great prison for all criminals of the world . This silly story is a very funny parody of 007 movies . Rowan Atkinson is very hilarious , as usual , and it is impossible not laughing with his stupidities . The singer Natalie Imbruglia is very beautiful , the unknown Ben Miller is the efficient assistant of Johnny English , and John Malkovitch , with a ridiculous French accent , complete the funny cast of this comedy . Title ( Brazil ) : ' Johnny English '
Bloody Revenge	In a juvenile detention center , the inmate Dave ( John Travers ) commits suicide after being abused with his friend Lindsay ( Ben McKay ) by the sociopath bullies Steve ( Stephen Wight ) and Lewis ( Luke Neal ) under the indifference of the other cell-mates . The governor sends them to an uninhabited island to improve their relationships and characters under the command of the tough monitor Jed ( Sean Pertwee ) . They meet another camping with female delinquents under the command of veteran soldier Louise ( Alex Reid ) and they camp in another area . However , when they are attacked by a pack of dogs and a mysterious man with a cross-bow wearing camouflage , they join forces fighting to survive under the leadership of Callum ( Toby Kebbell ) . After a magnificent debut with " Deathwatch " , the director and writer Michael J . Bassett makes another great movie , the gore " Wilderness " . The original story is well-constructed , with a perfect development of characters and supported by great acting and special effects . Title ( Brazil ) : " Os Selvagens " ( " The Savages " )
The Tiresome Life of a Powerful Millionaire , Who Can Have the Woman he Wants , But Is Afraid of Age and Death	Marcelo ( Tarcísio Meira ) is a tiresome , powerful and selfish millionaire . He lives in an existentialistic crisis , since he is a successful businessman but afraid of age and death . He can have the woman he wants , but in his intimacy , he desires the unique impossible woman , his daughter . In the present , he has the companion of two whores - Lila ( Nicolle Puzzi ) and Renata ( Monique Lafond ) - but he is not satisfied . They three will spend Christmas and New Years Eve in an island where Marcelo has a mansion . In a party , he meets another whore - Diana ( Monique Evans , in the top of her sculptural beauty ) and invites her to go to the island with them . All of these delicious women are paid for satisfying him . While in the island , his daughter Berenice ( Bia Seidl ) visits him with her friend Beatriz ( Christiane Torloni ) . This holiday period will end Marcelo having an incestuous relation with Berenice . The end of the movie shows that even after reaching the impossible woman , Marcelo is not satisfied . In this erotic movie , Walter Hugo Khouri has the participation of at least five of the most beautiful and desirable women in Brazil : in the Eighties , Monique Evans , Monique Lafond , Nicolle Puzzi , Bia Seidl and Christiane Torloni were disputed by male magazines to be shot nude . The story about a powerful dissatisfied man has great dialogs . However , it is not indicated for all audiences .
The Television Screen Is the Retina of the Mind's Eye	The president of the Civic TV - channel 83 , Max Renn ( James Wood ) , is always looking for new cheap and erotic movies for his cable television . When his employee Harlan ( Peter Dvorsky ) decodes a pirate video broadcast showing torture , murder and mutilation called Videodrome , Max becomes obsessed to get these movies for his channel . He contacts his supplier Masha ( Lynne Gorman ) and asks her to find the responsible for the transmission . A couple of days later , Masha tells that Videodrome is real , actually snuff movies . Max's sadomasochist girlfriend Nicki Brand ( Deborah Harry ) decides to travel to Pittsburgh to have an audition to the show . Max investigates further , and through a video of the expert Professor Brian O'Blivion ( Jack Creley ) , he learns that that TV screen would be the retina of the mind's eye , being part of the brain , and Videodrome transmission creates a brain tumor in the viewer , changing the reality in video hallucination . " Videodrome " , in my point of view , is a prophetic movie of David Cronenberg . The first time I saw this movie was in 1985 or 1986 , when video-clubs where novelty in Brazil , and the local price of a videocassette was more than US$ 650 . 00 . In that occasion , I recall that I was visually impressed with this gore , weird and bizarre movie . Twenty-three years later , I have just seen it on DVD and I realize the vision of this great director . He was able to foresee the importance of television for mankind , influencing people with sublimated messages , manipulating audiences and becoming very powerful , and how violence on screen can generate violence . I particularly like the following quotes : " The television screen is the retina of the mind's eye " and " Television is reality , and reality is less than television . " Last but not the least , Brazil is not located in Central America , but in South America . Title ( Brazil ) : " Videodrome ? A Síndrome do Vídeo " ( " Videodrome ? The Syndrome of the Video " )
Exotic and Dramatic View of Mexico	In 1931 , Sergei M . Eisenstein , Grigori Aleksandrov and another crew member moved to USA , to work for Paramount , but the agreement never happened . The team decided to go to Mexico to make a movie about its history and culture . They joined some Mexican intellectuals , traveled around Mexico trying to assimilate the culture of the people , and shot film . However , for some unexplained reason , the laboratory that revealed the films in Hollywood , kept them and sent them to a Museum in New York , and Eisenstein was never able to edit his movie . In 1979 , the Soviet Union government retrieved the fragments and Grigori Aleksandrov edited this movie , based on the notes and storyboard of Eisenstein . " ¡Que Viva Mexico ! - Da zdravstvuyet Meksika ! " is divided in three parts . The first one ( introduction ) gives a historical panel of Mexico and the Mexican people . The second part is a fiction based on the dramatic fate of a bride , submitted to the powerful farmer of the area close to her wedding day , and her fiancé , his brother and two friends trying to rescue her . The conclusion of the story would be called " " Soldadera " , the wives of the soldiers , and would be based on the revolution of Mexican people . Unfortunately Eisenstein had no more budgets to film the rest of the story . The last part , called Epilog , is about the celebration of the " memorial day ' ( day of the dead ? " dia de finados " ) , with the population wearing masks of skull and celebrating death . The footages are amazing , considering they were shot in 1931 . Title ( Brazil ) : " Viva Mexico !
Good Werewolf Romance Based on a True Story	In 1852 , in Galicia , Spain , the traveling vendor Manuel Blanco Romasanta is tried for the murder of at least fifteen persons . He claims to be the ninth son of a family and therefore a werewolf , and Queen Isabel II changes his death sentence to life . Once in prison , he dies for unknown cause . First of all , I would like to tell that I am not writing a spoiler : most of this information is on the box of the Brazilian DVD and in many reviews . I believe the lack of mystery with the lead character , i . e . , the viewer knows who is the killer before watching the film , is the greatest flaw in this screenplay . The story is great , recalling " La Pacte des Loups " ; the cinematography and effects are wonderful ; and Julian Sands and Elsa Pataky have excellent performances and chemistry , with the story centered in their romance first , and in the rage of Bárbara for Romasanta later . However , I have never heard about this Romasanta , and the writer used fictional and historical events to write this story , with elements of horror and romance . I believe he could have kept the mystery about Romasanta , disclosing his crimes only in the end . Anyway , this movie is original and very attractive and really worth watching . Title ( Brazil ) : " Romasanta ? A Casa da Besta " ( " Romasanta ? The House of the Beast " )
Very Original and Intriguing Story	In Bangkok , in a low-budget hotel called " Heaven " , the fate of four guests are interconnected due to a theft in a room : Sean ( Jonathan Rhys-Meyers ) , a paranoid English drug dealer , that is dealing with a powerful local drug lord ; the also British psychologist Rosa ( Saskia Reeves ) , who is grieving the loss of her son and making a research with poor children in Thailand ; a seriously wounded killer , hired to kill the mobster ; and Wit ( Alexander Rendel ) , a thirteen years old abused bellboy , that steals the guests . In the end , we see that it is almost impossible to control life , and sometimes , a subtle incident may lead to fatality . I did not find the word " Tesseract " in Webster or American Heritage Dictionary , but in internet , I found that it would be a 4-dimensional cube . The explanation of this word is also provided in the introduction of the movie . Using this concept with four characters in a hotel , reducing to three and converging to one , the screenplay writer wrote a very original and intriguing story , apparently based on a book , confused in the first twenty minutes since it is non-linear , but attractive when the viewer understands the plot . I believe that watching for the second time , this film would be better and better , and that is my intention in a near future . I liked the idea of how difficult would be to control our destiny , which is connected and affected by the actions of other people . Jonathan Rhys-Meyers , Alexander Rendel and Saskia Reeves give great performances . I really recommend this movie to audiences that like a dark and different story . Title ( Brazil ) : " No Limite da Realidade " ( " In the Limit of Reality " )
Protecting the Son	In the middle of the night on the road , a young woman is going to the maternity for the delivery , when she suddenly glows and blows . Lana Lang and Clark Kent are driving a truck along the same road and find a baby in the crater created by the explosion . They take the baby to the hospital , and the Kent family temporarily guards him , who is connected to Clark . Lana and Clark give the name of Evan , and on the next day , he becomes a teenager , precociously aging . The scientists of Lex Luthor study the case and conclude that the boy needs a transfusion of the bone marrow of his unknown father . Clark tries to save Evan . Meanwhile , Genevieve Teague has a meeting with Lionel Luthor and menaces the integrity of Lex , in case the stone is not delivered to her . The good part of " Ageless " is the duel between the dangerous Genevieve and Lionel , who proves to be a master of the evil . The dark side of Lex is also presented in the last scene with his " Eventually " answer . The story of Evan is silly and without any explanation for the happenings with Evan and his mother . Title ( Brazil ) : " Envelhecendo " ( " Aging " )
The Future Enemy of Mankind	Clark Kent applies to community work in an institute for the aged to be close to Lana Lang . Clark's favorite patient is Cassandra Carver ( Jackie Burroughs ) , an old lady that foretells the future . Lana takes care of Harry Bollston ( George Murdock ) , an unknown former murder . When Harry falls in a lake full of kryptonite nearby the institution , he becomes younger again . The young Harry Volk ( Eric Christian Olsen ) revenges the descendants of the members of the jury that sentenced him in the past trying to kill them . One of these descendants is Jonathan Kent . " Hourglass " is a reasonable episode of " Smallville " , but not my favorite . The story has some flaws , like for example how the Kents could explain the death of old Harry Bollston in a pit for corn . However , the scene when Cassandra Carver sees the future of Lex Luthor is very impressive . Title ( Brazil ) : " Destino " ( " Fate " )
Although Being a Television Show , This Film Is An Excellent Comedy	Lorenzo ( Chema Muñoz ) is a market operator , who has just separated from his French wife . He is feeling very lonely , and his partner and friend decides to ' bring him back to night life ' , going to nightclubs and meeting some women . However , this behavior does not fit with the personality of Lorenzo , and his friend shows him a place where he could buy an Asian wife after a trial period . Lorenzo gets enthusiastic with the idea , and brings a gorgeous woman , who does not speak Spanish , but is an excellent housekeeper , cook and lover . Lorenzo falls in love with her , and before they get married , he starts suspecting she has a lover . He decides to follow her , when many secrets are revealed . This comedy was the great surprise of yesterday night : it is excellent . A few days ago , I bough a VHS called ' Casos da Vida Privada ' just because of Antonio Banderas and Carmen Maura . Their pictures and names were on the cover , and I decided to try it . I saw the first good episode ( ' La Mujer Feliz ' ) and I liked it . This ' The Oriental Woman ' is better than the other story . Although being a television show , the plot is very funny , the direction is great , and the cast , especially Chema Muñoz , is excellent . The doses of humor , drama and romance are perfect , and the plot is not corny . As previously referred , in Brazil , it was released on VHS , with the name ' Casos da Vida Privada : A Mulher Oriental ' ( ' Cases of the Private Life : The Oriental Woman ' ) together with a second episode , ' La Mujer Feliz ' ( ' The Happy Woman ' ) . Title ( Brazil ) : ' Casos da Vida Privada : A Mulher Oriental ' ( ' Cases of the Private Life : The Oriental Woman ' )

Máiquel becomes upset and challenge Suel to a duel . On the next day , Máiquel shoots and kills Suel , and becomes famous in the neighborhood as a vigilante . The fifteen years old mistress of Suel , Érica ( Natália Lage ) moves to his apartment and Máiquel becomes a sensation in the community where he lives . His fame of hero reaches the upper class dentist Dr . Carvalho ( Jóge Dória ) , who hires Máiquel to kill the man who raped his seventeen years old daughter Gabriela ( Mariana Ximenes ) . Meanwhile , Cledir gets pregnant and marries Máiquel . This is the beginning of his successful career of killer . In the end , Máiquel believes that the are two options for like : let it go , like a flow of a river , or use reins and ride it like a horse . It seems that the success of ' Cidade de Deus ' gave enough courage to other directors to expose to the world the underground life in the periphery and slums of the big Brazilian cities . ' O Homem do Ano ' is based on a successful book of Patrícia Melo called ' O Matador ' ( ' The Killer ' ) . In the book , the story takes place in the periphery of São Paulo , but once the reality in the periphery of Rio de Janeiro is the same and due to geographical reasons , the story was transposed to the Baixada Fluminense , one of the most violent places in Brazil . Its narration in off by Máiquel recalls a film-noir . The story has most of the components of the popular and cheap Brazilian newspapers : the common murders and execution by vigilantes in the periphery of the Brazilian big cities and the religious fanaticism of the hopeless low classes . The middle and upper classes passively accepts this fearful way of life . Most of the characters in this movie represents a great segment of our society , where in some weekends can show more than seventy deaths of ' anonymous and common persons ' only in Baixada Fluminense . The movie is never corny , there is no exaggeration in the situations and is based on the worst present problem of our society , the violence . Lack of education , corruption , impunity , lack of employment , very low salaries and life conditions , lack of perspective in life , lack of security , hypocrisy of the upper classes , all of these components in minor or greater proportions , result in the increasing violence showed in movies like ' O Homem do Ano ' , ' Cidade de Deus ' , ' Cidade dos Homens ' and other sad examples of Brazilian society . Just as a curiosity , Cláudia Abreu has a daughter ( Maria ) with the director José Henrique Fonseca , who is son of the writer Rubem Fonseca . Title ( Brazil ) : ' O Homem do Ano ' ( ' The Man of the Year ' )

Michael prepares a device to interfere in the television signal ; however , the guard sees his binoculars and believes it is a gun . The patrol breaks in Sona , and Whistler assumes the blame telling that he was watching birds and shows the bird guide to the commander . Andrew recognizes Whistler as McFadden , who was in Nice in 1997 with an ambassador . In this episode , the story is stalled , and the greatest question is who James Whistler or McFadden is . The new inmate performed by Dominic Keating from " Enterprise " is also intriguing . Title ( Brazil ) : " Interferência " ( " Interference " )
A Tense and Dramatic Episode	While having breakfast with the tense and formal Reed , Captain Archer is called from the bridge by T'Pol . The Enterprise finds a Minshara planet with a volcanic hemisphere , and T'Pol waits for further instructions . Suddenly there is an explosion in the hull of the Enterprise , with the destruction of many decks and wounded crew . Archer realizes that the Enterprise is in a cloaked minefield and one mine is attached to the hull . Reed wears an EV suit to disarm the mine , but a sharp device is activated and penetrates his leg , and attaching him to the hull . Meanwhile , an aggressive Romulan ship orders the Enterprise to leave immediately that sector of the space . " Minefield " is a tense and dramatic episode , with great performances of Dominic Keating and Scott Bakula . The story is engaging , developed in an adequate pace , and has good dialogs between Reed and Archer . Title ( Brazil ) : " Campo Minado " ( " Minefield " )

However , their shuttle pod is attacked by a radical faction of Coridans and they are taken hostage . While Trip and Reed try to rescue their Captain and Sub-Commander , they are surprisingly helped by the Andorian Commander Shran . " Shadows of P'jem " is another great episode of " Enterprise " , with an engaging story full of action and a very satisfactory resolution . Jolene Blalock is excellent in the role of the logical T'Pol that even visibly affect by the human behavior , sustain her roots . I loved the last line when T'Pol says to Captain Archer that she must follow the orders of her physician . Title ( Brazil ) : " Sombras de P'jem " ( " Shadows of P'jem " )
Another Good Version of the Life and Death of a Martyr	On June , 26th 1996 , in the Naas road , the Irish journalist of The Sunday Independent , Veronica Guerin ( Cate Blanchet ) , was executed by two men on a motorcycle . Veronica started researching and writing a series of matters about the powerful barons of drugs , and was eliminated by one of them . The movie begins with Veronica being murdered and dramatizes her last months of life , showing her fighting against the drug dealers , her life with her family and her relationship with her colleagues . In the end , shows the consequences of her death . The first time I saw the story of this brave journalist was in " When the Sky Falls " , and the excellent underrated actress Joan Allen gave a magnificent performance as usual and I found the movie outstanding . Although I prefer " When the Sky Falls " , Joe Schumacher's version is also a great version of the life and death of this martyr . Cate Blanchett is excellent in the role of Veronica Guerin , but it is not explained the reason why Veronica was so obsessed and usually avoided the presence of other reporters . She was originally graduated as accountant , and later she decided to be a journalist , and her graduation was when she was thirty-one years old . Therefore , she felt the need of going deeper and deeper in her matters to prove her value to her community . This information is available in the extras of " When the Sky is Falling " . I saw " Veronica Guerin " in an American DVD , and there are some expressions , probably common in Ireland , that I did not understand and did not find in the dictionary . Collin Farrell has a minor participation as a guy full of tattoos on the sidewalk and the cast has a great performance , in a touching story that hooks the attention of the viewer until the last scene . Title ( Brazil ) : " O Custo da Coragem ? Veronica Guerin " ( " The Cost of the Courage ? Veronica Guerin " )
A Great Movie of Gangsters	The story begins in 1999 , with an old gangster performed by Malcolm McDowell being advised that Freddie Mays ( David Thewlis ) would leave jail after thirty years in prison . His mood changes and he recalls 1968 , when he was a young punk ( performed by Paul Bettany ) , and he joined Freddie Mays ' gang , his envy of his mob boss and his betrayal . The whole story of these two characters is presented slowly , alternating violent and luxury places and action . I liked this movie a lot . I would dare to say that it mixes ' Goodfellas ' , ' Casino ' , ' Pulp Fiction ' and ' Reservoir Dogs ' . Paul Bettany has a great performance as a psycho-killer : differently of those sadists in Hollywood movies that make grimaces , the simple look and expression of Paul Bettany is enough to terrify the viewer . The direction is great , and there is one specific scene that I appreciated very much . When Freddie Mays invites Paul Bettany's character to have a drink in a nightclub : Freddie is giving his overcoat to the attendant and the image of Paul Bettany is reflected in the glass of the door exactly over Freddie . The selection of Paul Bettany for this role is perfect , but why not ages him through make-up ? Malcolm McDowell looks totally different from Paul Bettany ! Title ( Brazil ) : " Os Gangsters " ( " The Gangsters " )

But the greatest surprise is the identity of the owner of Scylla in the end of the episode . Title ( Brazil ) : Not Available .
A Beautiful Reconstitution of a Period , Good Actors and Actress and a Weak Drama	Priest Vallon ( Liam Neeson ) is the leader of the Dead Rabbits gang .

Some years later , he returns as Amsterdam ( Leonardo DiCaprio ) , gets closer to Bill , becomes his protégée and meets Jenny Everdeane ( Cameron Diaz ) , who becomes his mate . Amsterdam intends to revenge his father . These events happen having the landscape of the American Civil War . This drama is very shallow and maybe may interest Americans ( and specially New Yorkers ) , since it mixes historical facts and fiction . There is a great cast and a beautiful reconstitution of a period . I myself expected much more from this film due to the lots of nomination it had . It seems to me that it is too much pretentious .

Dick ; gripping screenplay with many twists that inclusive provides a hook for a possible sequel ; and fine performances of three of my favorite contemporary actors and actresses : the sensational Nicolas Cage , the wonderful Julianne Moore and the sweet Jessica Biel . I really liked a lot the hilarious sequence when Cris is " studying " the best way to approach to Liz in the restaurant . Title ( Brazil ) : " O Vidente " ( " The Fortuneteller " )

Along the days , there is a battle between science and religion in the court . " The Exorcism of Emily Rose " was a great surprise for me . Based on a true event , I was expecting a horror movie like " The Exorcist " , but actually it is a great story of trial , with the confrontation of science and religion , but with an agnostic lawyer defending and a religious one accusing a priest . The story is leaded by Erin , and her contact with the unknown and her final speech are some of the great moments of this film . Among the scariest parts are Dr .

The direction of Scott Derrickson is excellent , using special effects only when necessary , and very well supported by a magnificent cast , leaded by the wonderful Laura Linney and the great Tom Wilkinson , followed by the unknown Jennifer Carpenter , who is great in the role of Emily Rose , Campbell Scott and Colm Feore . Title ( Brazil ) : " O Exorcismo de Emily Rose " ( " The Exorcism of Emily Rose " )

The plot has drama , thriller , crime and suspense and hooks the attention of the viewer until the last scene . Title ( Brazil ) : ' Falando Com os Mortos ' ( ' Talking With the Dead ' )

There is a great confrontation between magic and science . This movie has a great performance of the whole cast and a great black and white photography . The story , about reality x illusion , is very attractive . The VHS released by the Brazilian distributor Continental is a shame . It seems to be filmed from an English projection , having black stripes covering the English subtitles and trembling image . Unfortunately , this is the unique option I have in Brazil to possess such a film in my collection . Title ( Brazil ) : ' O Rosto ' ( ' The Face ' )

Charlotte ( Scarlett Johansson ) is a bored and lonely wife of a photographer lodged in the same hotel as Bob . Together , they find the company of each other to supersede their loneliness in a foreigner country , and their proximity becomes in friendship and repressed love . ' Lost in Translation ' is a sensitive movie , with a great performances of Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson . The direction is precise and secure and the screenplay is quite original . The situation of Bob and Charlotte is very easy to be understood , if the viewer has had the experience of working expatriated alone in a country in the Orient , where the language , culture , behavior and social customs and habits are totally different from the Occident . He certainly will miss his family , sometimes will feel bored and confused , most of the times will have difficulties even to order the meals . I found ' Lost in Translation ' a beautiful , romantic and melancholic uncommon American film , since it looks like an European movie , but overrated , maybe because of the name of Sofia Coppola . Title ( Brazil ) : ' Encontros e Desencontros ' ( ' Meetings and Failure to Meet ' )

James Bond travels with the British accountant Vesper Lynd ( Eva Green ) to bet and defeat La Chiffre and force him to look for protection with the MI-6 , disclosing the names of the terrorists . James wins , but is double-crossed , in a game of betrayals and murders . The model " 007 " was completely exhausted in the last Pierce Brosnan movies , with silly plots and cartoonist scenes . All the previous actors were handsome , with the stereotype of the British gentleman , exactly the opposite of Daniel Craig . This actor is surprisingly responsible for the renewal of the franchise , presenting the best James Bond movie in the last years , with a violent and tough character in a great adventure . The beauty and elegance of Eva Green make her one of the most beautiful Bond girls ever . The screenplay , full of betrayals and plot points , is consistent and well resolved , and the viewer does not feel the running time of 144 minutes and the wonderful locations complete this great entertainment . Title ( Brazil ) : " Cassino Royale " ( " Casino Royale " )

After their vacations , they grow-up and their friendship remains solid as never . " The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants " is a sweet tale of friendship , love and loss of four girlfriends . I saw the good sequel in a flight two days ago , and both movies are great . The chemistry among Amber Tamblyn , Alexis Bledel , America Ferrera and Blake Lively is amazing and they really seem to be close friends . The movie is delightful , the performances of the actresses are fantastic , but I particularly liked the dramatic and never corny relationship between Tibby and Bailey . Title ( Brazil ) : " Quatro Amigas e um Jeans Viajante " ( " Four Friends and a Traveling Jeans " )

A tense , dramatic and violent relationship develops between Link and the group , with tragic consequences . This western is very different from the others , without action , but having dramatic psychological drama instead , including a claustrophobic situation in the house . Gary Cooper plays a protective good man who wants to forget his past ; Julie London's role is a lonely woman , who does not love any man or anything , but who falls in love with Link ; and the performances of the ' bad guys ' are fantastic . This movie is really a classic western . Title ( Brazil ) : ' O Homem do Oeste ' ( ' The Man of the West )

The naive Martha accepts the offer of her " solicitous friend " Lionel Luthor , but she does not realize the price of the gentle support of her treacherous acquaintance . I found a little inconsistent the situation of Clark easily disclosing his abilities to Victor while hiding them from his beloved Lana . Title ( Brazil ) : " Ciborgue " ( " Cyborg " )
The Cycle of Life Through the Lives of Five Persons	This movie pictures the life of five characters connect by a car accident in a snowing road , provoked by the projectionist Rene ( Ulrich Matthes ) and the broken farmer Theo ( Josef Bierbichler ) . Rene is a kind of melancholic intellectual , who has amnesia problem and takes picture of the most important events of his life to recall them .

The direction and the performance of the cast are excellent and the photography is wonderful . Title ( Brazil ) : ' Winter Sleepers ? Inverno Quente ' ( ' Winter Sleepers ? Hot Winter ' )
The Fresh-Blood Colored Flag of the Rising Sun	In 1937 , the Japanese army invades China in a cruel war and after the fall of Shanghai , the soldiers head to the capital Nanking . A group of Western foreigners led by John Rabe , Minnie Vautrin , Bob Wilson and George Fitch create the Safety Zone , a sanctuary that was not bombed by the Japanese airplanes , to protect thousands of refugees . While the Japanese soldiers reach the town on 13 December 1937 , raping , slaughtering and pillaging the civilian , the heroic group of Westerns defends the lives of about 250 , 000 Chinese sacrificing their own freedom , and succeeds to tell the world the crimes of war committed by the Japanese army in Nanking . The harrowing , heartbreaking and awesome " Nanking " retells the story of the genocide in Nanking in 1937 promoted by the Japanese army . In the late 90's I saw the also impressive and disturbing " Nanjing 1937 " ( a . k . a . " Don't Cry , Nanking " ) and I confess that was the first time I heard anything about this massacre . In the movie " Shake Hands with the Devil " , the Canadian General Romeo Dellaire has a fantastic line when he says that " genocide is when there are cargo train , concentration camps , gas chambers " . In Hollywood , usually genocide is associated to the Jews in World War II and there are dozens of excellent movies about this dark period of the contemporary history . " Nanking " uses letters and other documents written mainly by the group of Westerns that created the Safety Zone in touching and emotional lectures of great actors and actresses ; disturbing and heartbreaking testimonies of survivors ; a great number of footages , in a magnificent work of research ; and the wonderful music score of Kronos Quartet . I immediately associated how traumatic might have been the lives of these survivors after witnessing such cruel crimes of war . Further , in Nanking there were Westerns observers that told the world part of what happened in the city ; imagine in Shanghai and in the minor towns in the countryside on the way of the Japanese troops without foreign witnesses how violent these soldiers might have been with the population . These group of expatriated shows the difference that an individual can make . I was really disturbed and sad after watching this fantastic movie . Title ( Brazil ) : Not Available

When Lieutenant Reed is transported with two security guards to protect the hostages , they chase the Andorians through the sacred catacombs , where they discover a hidden secret . " The Andorian Incident " is so far the best episode of the First Season of Enterprise . The story introduces the Andorian breed , and discloses the real behavior of the Vulcans , who does not walk the way they talk . The disappointment of T'Pol with her own people is very clear and may change her relationship with Archer and the Enterprise crew . I liked very much watching the " Reanimator " Jeffrey Combs in the role of the Andorian Commander Shran . Title ( Brazil ) : " O Incidente Andoriano " ( " The Andorian Incident " )

When their rations finish and without means of communication , they move to Carbon Creek to get food , interacting with the inhabitants , finding job in the community and feeling the warm welcome of the gentle dwellers . " Carbon Creek " is a great episode about the unknown first contact of Vulcans on Earth . The story is ambiguous and it is never clear whether T'Mir and T'Pol are the same character , or T'Mir is really her great-great-grandmother . Trip in some moments is very inconvenient with his observation about T'Pol age , but this query may be a clue that they are the same person . Title ( Brazil ) : " Carbon Creek "

Touching and Sensitive ? A Very Beautiful Movie	The famous international conductor Daniel Daréus ( Michael Nyqvist ) has a heart attack with his stressed busy professional life and interrupts his successful career with an early retirement . He decides to return to his hometown in the north of Sweden , from where his mother left when he was a seven year-old sensitive boy bullied by Conny and other school mates , to live a low-paced life . He buys an old school and is invited to participate in the church choir by the local Shepherd Stig ( Niklas Falk ) , but the reluctant and shy Daniel refuses in the principle . However , he gets involved with the community and feels attracted by Lena ( Frida Hallgren ) , a local woman with a past with the local doctor . His music opens the hearts of the members of the choir , affecting their daily life : the slow Tore ( André Sjöberg ) has the chance to participate in the choir ; Inger ( Ingela Olsson ) , the wife of Stig , releases her repressed sexuality ; Gabriella ( Helen Sjöholm ) takes an attitude against her abusive and violent husband ; the gossiper and frustrated Siv ( Ilva Lööf ) opens her heart against Lena ; the fat Holmfrid ( Mikael Rahm ) cries enough against the jokes of the businessman Arne ( Lennart Jähkel ) ; even Daniel starts loving people and Lena as the love of his life . When they are invited to participate in an important contest in Vienna , Daniel finds his music opening the heart of people making his dream come true . " Så Som I Himmelen " is a touching and sensitive movie , with a very beautiful story . It is impressive how director Kay Pollak and the screenplay writers have been able to develop a great number of characters in 132 minutes running time . The performances are top-notch , supported by magnificent music score and at least two awesome moments : when Gabrielle sings her song in the concert , and certainly the last concert in Vienna with the audience , jury and everybody participating in the melody , and Daniel making his dream come true . Like in " Teorema " , the stranger changes the lives , not of only a family , but of a conservative community . Further , like many European movies , the open conclusion indicates that Daniel actually died , at least in my interpretation , reaching peace with the success of his music . My eyes became wet in these two scenes . Title ( Brazil ) : " A Vida no Paraíso " ( " The Life In the Paradise " )
A Lovely Movie , With Humor , Innocence , Great Screenplay and Direction and Outstanding Performances	Fernand Bornard ( Claude Rich ) is the responsible for the Botanic Garden and Zoo in Paris during the Second World War . He was a coward in the First World War and used to lie to his granddaughter Philippine ( the lovely Salomé Stévenin ) about his heroic features and participation in the past war . His son Armand ( Samuel Labarthe ) is a smuggler and a cooperator with the Nazi regime in Paris . He does not take much care of Philippine . Philippine's mother is an actress and singer of cabarets and does not take also care of her . On Philippine's eightieth birthday , her father decides to leave her at the grandfather's home after the permitted retire schedule and is arrested by the Germans . Then , he is convicted to death by fusillade and his father witnesses the execution of his son . Fernand hides the death of Armand to Philippine . In order to justify the absence of the father , he tells her that his son is a highly graduated member of the French resistance and responsible for many explosions and sabotage of German facilities . The situations generated by this lie are delicious . This is indeed a lovely movie . With humor , innocence , great screenplay and direction and outstanding performances of Claude Rich and Salomé Stévenin , it is a type of movie to be watched by the whole family . This film is not well known in Brazil : looks like a hidden jewel to be discovered by viewers who appreciate a sensible story with wonderful performances and direction . Roberto Benigni , with his Oscar winner ' Life is Beautiful ' , copied not only the screenplay of the fantastic ' Train de Vie ' , but also the innocence of this marvelous ' Les Jardin des Plantes ' .
A Nightmare on Kent Farm	Clark Kent has a nightmare with a girl called Sara Conroy ( Katharina Isabelle ) being chased by a weird creature called The Traveller ( John De Santis ) and sleeps for thirty-six consecutive hours . When he wakes up , he finds that Sara Conroy has just moved with her uncle and tutor Nicholas Conroy ( Christopher Shyer ) to the house on the next door that belonged to Lana Lang . Intrigued with the situation , he visits Sara with Lana Lang and see that the girl has been in coma for six years , increasing the mystery . Blending reality with dream , like in " A Nightmare on Elm Street " , and with the participation of Katharina Isabelle of " Ginger Snap " trilogy , " Slumber " is a great episode of " Smallville " . The sexy beginning , with Lana Lang bathing naked in the lake , would suffice to make " Slumber " a worthy story . Title ( Brazil ) : " Adormecido " ( " Asleep " )
Families Issues and Complex of Peter Pan	In Smallville High School , a swimmer mysteriously ages and dies , after meeting his girlfriend Chrissy Parker ( Maggie Lawson ) . The new principal Reynolds ( Richard Gant ) arrives and conflicts with Clark Kent because he is friend of Lex Luthor . The Kent family is having financial problems and Martha contacts her father , who has been away from the family for twenty years , to borrow some money . Lana Lang finds an old picture of her mother with an apparent boyfriend and asks Lex to investigate . " Redux " is an episode with many situations , some of them resolved , but others left open . There are new characters , such as Principal Reynolds and Clark's grandparent , and the stories are very good . Title ( Brazil ) : " Redux "
Teen Fatal Attraction	The Smallville High School is visiting Luthor Corp . , and Clark Kent is left behind with the science geek Alicia Baker ( Sarah Carter ) to get the next elevator . While in the lift with her , the cable breaks and Clark uses his heat vision to melt the security camera first , and his powerful force to stop the vehicle with his hand . Alicia in return " teletransports " Clark and herself to another floor . She discloses her ability to Clark and he tells her about his strength and heat vision . When they date , Clark finds that the girl is indeed obsessed for him , jeopardizing his privacy and Lana Lang's life , and not accepting to end their short relationship . Meanwhile , Lana finds that Adam keeps a journal about Clark and her , and she decides to evict him . When Adam uses the tenant laws to get more time , Lana asks for help to Lex Luthor . " Obsession " is one excellent episode of " Smallville " and I do not qualify it as one of the best because again the resolution of the situation of the secret of Clark Kent is flawed . He told his powers to Alicia , arrested her in the end , and nothing happens , i . e . , the girl does not expose his abilities to everybody . The promising conclusion , when the mission of Adam is disclosed , is great . Title ( Brazil ) : " Obsessão " ( " Obsession " )
Unfair , Sad , but Good Episode	When Lana Lang is attacked in her apartment and Jason Teague in his car by an invisible being , the Smallville's dwellers believe that the attempts were committed by Alicia Baker , and even Clark Kent does not believe on her innocence . Alicia shows Chloe Sullivan the abilities of Clark , expecting people to leave them alone , but she is murdered by the deranged Tim Westcott ( Derek Hamilton ) . Meanwhile Genevieve Teague looks for Lex Luthor trying to separate Jason from Lana . " Pariah " is a very unfair and sad , but also good episode of " Smallville " . I personally liked very much the character of Alicia Baker and the beautiful unknown actress Sarah Carter , and I did not like the way she died . The usually wise Martha and Jonathan Kent showed a great prejudice against Alicia , and Clark Kent seems to be a teenager without a strong personality . Now that Chloe knows the secret of Clark , let's see her behavior in the next episodes . Title ( Brazil ) : " A Excluída " ( " The Outcast " )

One of the Best Comedies of the 80's	In Philadelphia , Louis Winthorpe III ( Dan Aykroyd ) is a successful commodity broker of the Duke & Duke , owned by the cheap millionaires Randolph ( Ralph Bellamy ) and his brother Mortimer ( Don Ameche ) Duke . Louis , who was graduated in Harvard , has an upper class lifestyle , living in a mansion with the butler Coleman ( Denholm Elliott ) , who also drives his Mercedes Benz , and is engaged of the wealthy Penelope Witherspoon ( Kristin Holby ) . After an incident in the sophisticated Heritage Club with the homeless beggar Billy Ray Valentine ( Eddie Murphy ) , Randolph defends that the situations of Louis and Billy Ray were caused by the environment where each man lives while Mortimer defends a genetic issue . They bet one dollar and decide to force Louis and Billy Ray to switch places : they frame Louis , planting drugs and a theft in his pocket , and he is arrested and loses his job , house , car , savings and credit cards ; and they invite Billy Ray for the position of Louis . The desperate Louis meets the golden hearted whore Ophelia ( Jamie Lee Curtis ) , who lodges him at her house and helps him . When Billy Ray overhears the Duke Brothers discussing their bet in the bathroom , he seeks out Louis and together they plot their revenge . " Trading Places " is certainly one of the best comedies of the 80's . Eddie Murphy in the beginning of his career was extremely funny and together with Dan Aykroyd , they are hilarious ; the veterans Denholm Elliott , Don Ameche and Denholm Elliott are amazing ; and Jamie Lee Curtis extremely sexy . I have just watched this movie again now on the DVD released by Paramount Pictures in Brazil ( Special Edition for Collector ) that shamefully does not have subtitles in Portuguese . I can read and understand English , but most of the Brazilian population does not . Therefore it is a complete lack of respect from this major distributor . Title ( Brazil ) : " Trocando as Bolas "
Delightful Romantic Musical With the Lovely Rita Hayworth	In Brooklyn , the nightclub dancer Rusty Parker ( Rita Hayworth ) has a simple but happy life dancing in the McGuire's , owned by her boyfriend Danny ( Gene Kelly ) . Rusty , Danny and Genius ( Phil Silvers ) have a ritual on Friday nights : they order oysters in a bar , trying to find a pearl . The life of Rusty changes when she participates and wins a contest to be the cover page of the Vanity magazine . She is invited to work in a huge theater in Broadway , whose owner proposes her . She loses her happiness and starts drinking in her new life style , missing the love of Danny and her old friends . ' Cover Girl ' is a delightful romantic comedy , very naive and having magnificent parts , such as the beauty and talented Rita Hayworth dancing , singing and acting ; Gene Kelly , specially in two scenes , dancing with himself and with Rusty and Genius on the street ; the songs and the choreography of the dances are also spectaculars . Danny , the character of Gene Kelly , is almost nasty with his chauvinist behavior . Rita Hayworth surprised me with her talent : I found her amazing in ' Gilda ' , but she is stunning in ' Cover Girl ' . In accordance with the information on the cover of the VHS , ' Cover Girl ' was the first musical where the songs were part of the plot , giving continuity to the story , instead of just being ' thrown ' in the movie . My sixteen years old son saw this movie with a friend of the same age in a recent Gene Kelly festival and they loved ' Cover Girl ' , therefore I dare to say that this classic is recommended to any movie lover and not only to the old generations . Title ( Brazil ) : ' Modelos ' ( ' Models ' )
The Press as the Vehicle of Manipulation of a Nation	The cynical , unethical and unscrupulous journalist Charles ' Chuck ' Tatum ( Kirk Douglas ) arrives in a small New Mexico newspaper asking for a chance . He was fired from famous newspapers because of drinking problem , lying and even for having an affair with the wife of one of his bosses . His real intention is to use the small newspaper as a " swimming board " to a bigger one . After one year without a bang news and totally bored , Chuck travels with a younger reporter to make the coverage of a matter about rattlesnakes . When they arrive in an isolated gas station , he is informed that a man called Leo Minosa ( Richard Benedict ) is trapped alive in an old Indian mine in a nearby place called Mountain of the Seven Vultures . Chuck manipulates the local corrupt sheriff , the engineer responsible for the rescue operation and Leo's wife Lorraine Minosa ( Jan Sterling ) , and a rescue that could be made using a simple and common process in twelve hours , lasts six days using a sophisticated drilling system and creating a circus in the previously desert place . Everybody profits with the accident except the victim . Movies about manipulation of people are usually excellent . I remember Costa-Gravas ' " Mad City ( 1997 ) , Barry Levinson's " Wag the Dog ( 1997 ) " , Howard Hawks ' " His Girl Friday ( 1940 ) " , and even the recent real case of the chemical weapons . Yesterday I saw " Ace in the Hole " for the first time and I really was impressed how this film is amazingly real and updated . There are elements present in every modern society , such as : the powerful sheriff very corrupt , like most of the worldwide members of the governments ; the press , interested in selling news only ; the victim used for other interests greater than rescuing him ; and the people , completely manipulated and with very short memory . Kirk Douglas is amazing in the role of a nasty reporter . I do not understand why this movie is not in the IMDb Top 250 . Title ( Brazil ) : " A Montanha dos Sete Abutres " ( " The Mountain of the Seven Vultures " )

Title ( Brazil ) : ' Matar ou Morrer ' ( ' To Kill or To Die ' )

The concert was recorded live , having the direction of Andy Harcott and using many cameras and lights distributed in the theater .
