" I'm only advancing a little hypothetical science fiction . "	I am devastated . I didn't think there could be a film worse than " Beast of Yucca Flats " , and I watched that one twice . Connoisseurs of bad movies will be tested to the hilt by " Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet " ; immediately after viewing it you will ask yourself why . I had all I could do to stop rocking back and forth to force myself to the very end . Granted , I learned much from IMDb reviewers who posted on this film prior to mine , and can appreciate the historical perspective . However history doesn't make a good movie , and the Russians showed here why they fell short in the space race . The lizard men and pterodactyl effects were bested at least three decades earlier in the original epic " King Kong " , while underwater scenes look like they were shot directly through aquarium glass . At least I recognize black mollies and tetras when I see them . The real sci-fi involved here is how they ever got Basil Rathbone to appear in the American version of this turkey . Sounds like a case for Sherlock Holmes . At least the writers got one thing right in a cosmic context - " There's no fair or unfair to a meteorite , you get hit , you die " . The only other comment I can agree with was made by astronaut Sherman near the end of the movie - " This is a mess now . "
" That night , all seemed well in the town of Shekar . "	A poor man's Chewbacca , " The Snow Creature " gives literal meaning to the term ' walking carpet ' . The Abominable Snowman concept gets off to an inauspicious screen start with this offering from 1954 , but unlike the intrepid explorers who bring one back alive , you won't have to reach a high altitude to get dizzy watching this one . Instead you'll be mesmerized by the hypnotic dance of the Yeti as he moves with exact precision forward and back , a feat remarkably produced by replaying the same scene over and over again . For something a little more original , you'll have to concentrate on Sherpa guide Subra ( Teru Shimada ) , who hijacks a botanical expedition into the Himalayan Mountains after his wife is captured by a Yeti . An inspired scene has him taking out the party's lone short wave radio with a characteristic logical explanation - " Subra only want to kill radio machine " . Probably the most interesting part of the film was the brief geography lesson at the opening , focusing on a map of the Himalayas and a brief description of it's border with the Ganges and Brahmaputra . Even though the expedition makes it's way up mountains , it's mostly down hill for the participants in this clunker . The movie is best viewed in the same condition the Yeti was kept as he was transported down the mountain from his icy lair - upside down and in a semi conscious state .
" You're never lost , you always know exactly where you are . "	An interesting premise comes to naught in this end of the world parable which never really establishes any semblance of credibility , at least in the mind of this viewer . When a vacationing banker and his wife , along with their lawyer go skin diving in Puerto Rico and come up for air , they find their chartered boat skipper dead , along with presumably , everyone else in the world . I don't know about you , but under the same circumstances , I think I'd be a little more panicked about what's going on , with a more than just a feeble attempt to make contact with the rest of the world . Instead , this trio simply resigns to their fate , with the men tiptoeing around their relationship with Evelyn ( Betsy Jones-Moreland ) , the apparent " Last Woman on Earth " . The film devolves into little more than pseudo intellectual babble as characterized by lines like " All that's left for us is to live without pain " . When the inevitable clash between " The Last Two Men on Earth " eventually occurs , I was looking for both to go over the oceanside cliff to at least give meaning to the title of the film . Instead the bad guy gets to keep the girl , in an unsatisfying finish that does nothing to offer sensibility to what went before . You have nothing to worry about if you take a pass on this one , even if you're a die-hard Roger Corman fan .
" It's only a building , lives are more important . "	The ninja kids in question are descendants of the Ming Dynasty who wear a talisman of their origin . The Ching want to kill them to remove all trace of their heritage . Just about the entire film is spent by the young martial artists in training with stone benches that will come in handy for the film's climax when they must do battle with the evil emperor in a giant spinning top . You couldn't make this up , so I'm wondering how they got that into the film . The movie mildly explores the relationship of an overbearing master who relentlessly trains his protégés , punishing them when they misbehave or don't perform to perfection . The scene when Wu Chan slaps the youngest boy changed the entire flavor of the story for me , especially since he didn't redeem himself in any way later on . The attempts at humor generally fall flat , like the pair of lanky warriors who might have been the two stooges of kung fu . There is one comedic scene done particularly well though . A few of the boys come upon a young female martial artist taking a bath in the river and one of the boys remarks - " Brother , why doesn't she have this ? " , while another checks his own anatomy for reassurance . I was perplexed by one scene near the end of the movie when the ninjas were working out in the cave . There on the floor in rather bold relief and colored in red was a large swastika . No mention of it was offered in the story , but it sure looked strange . Not being a big fan of the genre , I was intrigued enough to pick up this DVD when I saw the title in a bargain bin at a local store , especially since it was paired with another flick called " Little Mad Guy " . It only cost a buck , and to be honest , it was worth every penny , which is to say , about fifty cents worth .
" I wouldn't give you a plug nickel against fifty honest to God brass button soldiers . "	Chuck Connors and Cesar Romero head an otherwise unknown cast in this tale set in South America in 1870 , as Will Hansen ( Connors ) leads a group of four ex-Confederate soldiers now plying their trade as mercenaries . Hansen is the only member of the band that seems to have any hint of a hard edge , the rest are just a bunch of good old boys with no drive or direction of their own . The South American setting could be just about anywhere since no country is ever named , but it might just as well have been Mexico for the portrayal offered by the two opposing forces . On one side , General Alehandro Martinez offers Hansen and his comrades pay in exchange for information on the opposition in the valley town of San Carlos . Cesar Romero is the mayor there , determined to protect his town , but one wonders from what . The conflict between Martinez and Romero is never made known , maybe that's why Hansen and his men have no emotional involvement in the proceedings . It would be difficult to describe the action in the film - there is none . There are two romantic angles involving Hansen and a gypsy woman , while one of his men named Ike ( Aron Kincaid ) tries to woo a senorita from the local convent . If the film's pace wasn't slow enough as it was , it's accentuated by the doleful strumming of a guitar from time to time , bringing one's attention to the fact that nothing is going on . All doesn't go well for Hansen though , since he missed his appointment with General Martinez , he'll have to pay for that indiscretion . That prompts his men to think for themselves for the first time , and they take a stand with the citizens of San Carlos . You'll have to watch the film to see how far that goes , but even amidst the flying cannonballs , it's kind of anti climactic . One never feels any empathy for this bunch , and that's what makes the movie largely forgettable . If you're a Chuck Connors fan , you'll be better served by any single episode of his " Rifleman " , which will have more story and excitement to it in twenty six minutes than this hour and a half sleeper . The only thing I found interesting in the film was how much Connors appeared to have aged in the decade since the Rifleman series ended . Oh wait , maybe it happened during the filming !
" On my way in I planned a way out . "	On the trail of the once stolen and now missing " Nardo Diamonds " , police woman Lee Hamilton ( Carole Mathews ) infiltrates the female members of said gang behind prison walls . Planning a jail break , she accompanies Beverly Garland , Marie Windsor and Jil Jarmyn into the swamps of Louisiana's bayou country where the gems are hidden . Along the way , the quartet runs into Mike Connors and his little bayou baby Marie ( Susan Cummings ) by way of the Mardi Gras . Marie earns her status as a gold digging , whiny opportunist , so that by the time she's attacked by an alligator , you wind up rooting for the reptile . " Swamp Women " doesn't appear to be much more than an opportunity for director Roger Corman to put shapely women in cut off shorts on display in a lush tropical setting . It doesn't take long for the jailbirds to ditch their prison garb and land some eye candy duds for their swamp journey . You know it's only a matter of time before the obligatory cat fights and wet blouse tussles take center stage . Eventually , redhead Vera ( Windsor ) with visions of the entire fortune to call her own turns renegade . She ditches the group and attempts to escape with the gems , so why she climbs a tree instead of taking the boat is a mystery . Mike Connors is credited in the cast as " Touch " Connors , and doesn't have much more to do in the film other than ogle the ladies . I'm not sure , but I bet when he auditioned for the part he said he could do it with his hands tied behind his back . This is another mid 1950's film utilizing a color film process known as Pathe . My copy was heavy on the reds and browns including the swamp scenes , making it all look a bit unnatural . The entire business was filmed in and around New Orleans and Lacombe County . What's surprising is how many name actors wound up in this effort , with one on the way up ( Connors ) , one on the way down ( Windsor ) and one still going strong ( Garland ) . After watching the movie , there's only one thing that I'm still left wondering about - what prison cell in the country has a window ?
" OK , you bloodsucking weasel , where's Manfred ? "	The lone trivia note regarding this film states that it was made in color and released in the U . S . in black and white . Surprisingly then I suppose , the color version shows up on a three DVD / nine movie set of films from St . Clair Vision under their ' Pirates ' compilation . Echoing the sentiment of the only other reviewer for the film at this time , charisma is a word that need not apply here . In fact it takes some doing to figure out what's going on , but the basics are something like this . A usurper to the throne of Monteforte has done away with the Duke and has kidnapped his young son ( even though a quick storyboard at the beginning of the film states the Duke is in exile ) . Manfred ( Andrea Aureli ) is supported by Saracen pirates looking a bit like members of the Papal Royal Guard . A rival band of pirates from the Black Hawk are led by Captain Richard ( Gerard Landry ) , attempting to set things right by the original Duke . The Duke of Monteforte happened to have a rather beautiful daughter Eleanor ( Pina Bottin ) , thereby providing for the romantic angle . There you have it , that's about all you need to know before , during , or after the film is over . I would hope the original Italian dialog was more original than the English translation , which featured such Twentieth Century clichés ( in a Fifteenth Century setting ) as - " It's no good , let's make a break for it ! " In fact the most inspired line I heard in the film was the ' bloodsucking weasel ' reference in my summary above . Listen , you won't lose a lot of sleep if you pass on this salty sea tale on land , or conversely , if you do watch it , it just might put you to sleep . The best thing this one has going for it is the U . S . release title - " The Pirate of the Black Hawk " .
" You'd better run along before a storm breaks , ' cause I've got a feeling I'm gonna cloud up and rain all over you . "	As in John Wayne's earlier film " Blue Steel " , a polka dot neckerchief figures in the plot of this Lone Star production . It belongs to Rudd Gordon ( Dennis Moore ) , the man who killed John Mason's ( Wayne ) father in a botched hold up attempt . Racing after the bandit gang , Mason is injured , and is nursed back to health by Rudd's sister Alice ( Marion Burns ) . Alice is the object of Ben McClure's ( Reed Howes ) affection , but it seems she has eyes for Mason . It doesn't take long for Mason to sort things out , and in a final gun battle , McClure takes out Rudd who lies in ambush for Mason , while the saloon owner portrayed by Yakima Canutt guns down McClure . As in most of the Lone Star films , Wayne's character gets the girl in the end , even when he's not trying . In fact , Mason encourages McClure to propose to Alice , even after the engagement ring Ben bought for her winds up stolen . Nevertheless , the film closes on a wagon leaving town , Mason and Alice aboard with a sign on the back reading " Just Hitched Up " . If you're a John Wayne fan , you'll give this film a try , but don't expect much . It suffers from clumsy editing , and as typical with Wayne's other Lone Star films , the title has nothing to do with the story .
" Cease fire you fool idiots , you're shootin ' at the law . "	I remember seeing only one Lash LaRue film as a kid growing up , but the image of the black clad cowboy brandishing a bull whip has remained with me ever since . Seeing one of these " B " Westerns some sixty years after they were made is a neat exercise in nostalgia , and only goes to show how far films have come since the good old days . As far as shoot ' em ups go , this one has a lot of them , about every ten minutes between different factions . Like many ( most ? ) of these oaters , the title doesn't really have much to do with the story , though this one comes close . But instead of " Border Feud " , why couldn't it have been the " Blue Girl Gold Mine Feud " ? That would have made more sense and better described the action . Lash LaRue's character is Marshal Cheyenne Davis , helping out Sheriff Fuzzy Q . Jones ( Fuzzy St . John ) sort out the differences between two feuding families over gold mine rights in the town of Red Gulch . However there's a third party interested in keeping hostilities going ; Jack Barton ( Bob Duncan ) and his backer Doc Peters ( Ian Keith ) plan to move in when the families wipe each other out . It might have worked too , but with a cute Condon sister ( Gloria Marlen ) romanced by the opposing family's Bob Hart ( Kenneth Farrell ) , the truth will have to make things right . You can tell this PRC picture ( Producers Releasing Corporation ) film is an entirely low budget affair . Watch for a scene in the second half when Fuzzy shoots one of Barton's bad guys , he repositions himself ever so slightly so he can continue to fall down a stairway - no time for do-overs . " Border Feud " , along with most of these era Westerns are great for a one hour diversion , as long as they're not taken too seriously . What I'd like to know though , is how is it that no matter where Cheyenne is at the start of a gunfight , he can always find a way to sneak up behind the shooters ?
" When it comes to choosin ' sides Dinkie , you're not so good . "	Dare Rudd ( John Wayne ) and sidekick Dink Hooley ( Syd Saylor ) are itinerant cowpunchers who can't seem to stay in one place very long . In " Helltown " , the boys are headed to Montana , where they meet up with Rudd's cousin Tom Fillmore ( Johnny Mack Brown ) , who offers them a job . It's a hoot to see the boys wearing aprons as they start out as cooks with the herd , although Dare becomes self conscious when Miss Judith ( Marsha Hunt ) rides into camp . Judy is Tom's girl , but the attraction between her and Dare is evident early on . Fillmore has a cattle herd to move , and promotes Dare to running the drive , partly to prove to Judy that he may not be up to the task . Meanwhile , bad guy Bart Hammond ( Monte Blue ) has his eyes on Fillmore's cattle , but when his henchmen fail to rustle the herd , he figures it's easier to win the money that Dare was paid at the end of the trail . Conning Dare into a rigged card game with his man Brady ( James Craig ) , Dare's money begins to evaporate hand after hand . It's only when Dare fails to show up back at Fillmore's ranch that Tom goes out to find his cousin . Exposing the cheats , Tom , Dare and Dink high tail it before the bad guys can get their revenge . " Helltown " , also known as " Born to the West " , was released in 1937 by Favorite Films Corporation , a couple of years after Wayne's series of Westerns for Lone Star Productions . It only slightly alters the Lone Star formula ; Wayne does get the girl at the end of the film , but here he was trying . There's a great runaway horse scene where Wayne rescues Marsha Hunt , in which Johnny Mack Brown's horse does a complete somersault spill . Syd Saylor does a nice job as the comic relief pal , doing his best to sell lightning rods to unsuspecting victims . He replaces familiar faces George " Gabby " Hayes and Yakima Canutt here , staples of the Lone Star films . John Wayne's charisma is beginning to develop here , preparing him for the leap to super star status that he eventually achieved . " Helltown " was based on a novel by legendary Western author Zane Grey . If you're looking for more films based on Grey's stories , try " Fighting Caravans " with Gary Cooper , " The Light of Western Stars " with Victor Jory , " Drift Fence " with Buster Crabbe , and " Heritage of the Desert " with Randolph Scott .
" I belong to the jungle . "	If you've seen more than a couple of Johnny Weismuller's ' Jungle Jim ' movie adventures , you won't have any trouble spotting the scenes repeated from earlier films in the franchise . " Fury Of The Congo " has at least two , utilizing Jim's wrestling match with a leopard from the first film of the series ( " Jungle Jim " ) , and later on there's a view of Tamba the chimp in a vine swing over a ravine from the prior picture , " Captive Girl " . Come to think of it , those shots of the mountain top pass might have been the ones used in " The Lost Tribe " as well . That's one thing the Poverty Row producers of the era did well , and that was to economize wherever possible . At least a little more creativity went into this story than we've seen before . The plot deals with a rare jungle animal called the ' Okongo ' , described as a cross between an antelope and a zebra . That of course presumes that interspecies breeding is possible , but since it isn't , it's at this point you can leave your thinking cap on the couch . Curiously , dark Okongos have a pattern of white stripes , and light colored ones have the same pattern in black stripes , in a way that zebras just can't duplicate . It gets better . The Okongos feed on a rare narcotic plant ( sounds like ' madro ' ) , and then produce a glandular drug that has an even more concentrated effect . That makes them a prime target for drug smugglers who want to capture the Okongos for illicit trade . I found it pretty interesting that with all the rare animals they might have come up with to use in a story line , it's probably best that the writers made this all up . The creativity doesn't end there either . This is the first time out we see Jungle Jim use a bolo as a weapon , and with great accuracy of course . Besides the leopard mentioned earlier , Jim also defeats a giant hairy tarantula-like spider in an awkward looking battle where he's on his back the entire time . You know , you can say all you want about Superman , but the real Man Of Steel was Jungle Jim . In film after film , going hand to claw with lions , tigers , leopards and crocodiles , Jim never came away with even a scratch ! Of course there's never any doubt that Jungle Jim prevails in this one too , the downside however being that most of the finale in a violent desert storm goes on a lot longer than it needed to , much like the filler between Skipper and Caw-Caw in previous films . Which is another downside to the story , they're both not here , giving way to Tamba as Jim's animal companion in this one . I think he might have lost points for knocking Jim into a pool of quicksand though . But at least there's a pretty girl around as in the prior films ; Sherry Moreland is effective as Jim's native guide to locate the Okongo .
" This is a mad dream Antinea , but I shall put an end to the madness . "	The title " Hercules and the Captive Women " is a bit of a misnomer , there was only one woman captive , and along with her mother , Queen Antinea of Atlantis , were the only two women in the entire film . The International English title mentions the ' Conquest of Atlantis ' , and that probably makes more sense , but in the end , it's the destruction of Atlantis that takes center stage . There's an entire mythology offered by Zantas , the last high priest of Uranus , that explains what's going on with Antinea and her cohort of Grand Vizier clones . It involves the betrayal of Uranus and how at his death , his blood becomes a rock of power , which Antinea will use to become omnipotent . Only the rays of the sun can destroy the rock , so that clue is a preview as to how Hercules will save the day . Reg Park is the beefy Hercules in this film , probably the best known bodybuilder after Steve Reeves to don the mantle of Zeus ' son . The entire first half of the picture has him unusually resigned to his fate ; his buddy Androcles , the King of Thebes had him drugged so he could whisk him away to do battle against an unknown enemy . Herc's son Hylus was in on the scheme and tries to stay out of dad's sight as long as possible to avoid a Herculean butt kicking . One has to consider just how effective a king Androcles actually was . He's on a mission to save his kingdom , and not one warrior from Thebes accompanies him ; he had to man the ship with galley slaves and cutthroats . He mentions to Hercules that his senators didn't agree with him , but come on , he's the King ! At least Hercules was sharp enough to avoid being drugged a second time . When Antinea attempts to slip him a mickey , Herc fakes it so he can continue investigating the secrets of Atlantis . He had some fun earlier defeating the shape shifting Proteus who protected the island from the outside world . The other effect that caught my eye was when one of Antinea's ineffective soldiers got the ' House on Haunted Hill ' acid wash reducing him to a skeleton . I'd be curious to see the outtakes from this picture . How many times can you use the word ' Uranus ' before it starts to take it's toll on cast , crew and audience ? I'm sure by the time Atlantis blew up , Hercules was ready to say - ' you watch yours and I'll watch mine ' . And what about the captive women , er , woman ? Well she hooks up with Hylus on the voyage home , exchanging a major lip lock with Hercules ' son as they sail off into the sunset . All's well as Androcles comes out of his state of amnesia , and he doesn't remember a thing . As for Hercules , he shows just how powerful a son of a Greek god can be ; when he climbs aboard the ship after swimming to safety from Atlantis , he's as dry as a bone !
" Child marriage must go ! "	This just might be the creepiest movie I've seen to date , and not even for reasons posted in some of the other viewer comments on this board . The scene that got to me was the wedding ceremony near the end of the story with old Jake Bolby ( Warner Richmond ) all but licking his chops to get little Jennie Colton ( Shirley Mills ) home for consummation of the marriage . I don't doubt that stuff like this went on during the era represented , or that it might even be happening today under cover of darkest secrecy , but seeing it on display in this ' educational ' format was downright horrific . As with the exploitation drug films of the 1930's , the film makers were attempting to hit the lowest common denominator on the prurient interest scale to make a quick buck and move on to the next subject . It seemed to be a prerequisite with the anti-drug films to include a dead body in the story for graphic punctuation , and so it was here too ; impending child bride weddings cause suffering , pain , and even death . Now on the other hand , I didn't seem to have as much a problem with Jenny's nude swim scene that most other reviewers had . Within the context of the story , it seemed like a natural thing to do at the time , probably the only way these mountain people ever got to take a bath . There was really nothing ' to see ' in the version I watched , though I understand the Mill Creek DVD presentation is somewhat less graphic with a couple of missing minutes of footage . I'm almost tempted to go back to see if there was something I missed , but then I'd be part of that low end prurient interest faction , so I think I'll pass . You know what else was pretty nasty ? How about those pigeons dumping on the schoolbooks in the Thunderhead Mountain School classroom ? I wonder if there was an exploitation film about the dangers of bird doo ?
" We gotta finish like we began - together ! "	Well now , here's a crackerjack idea - let's rob the bank where I work , turn ourselves in the next day , do the time , and when we get out , get the money and live happily ever after . This might have worked if a little more thought was put into it , but instead what you have is a pretty lame story that fails on just about every level . Not that I would consider it a ' Worst Movie Ever ' candidate , my own personal Top Ten Worst List is already filled . What I have to do here is come up with a new category , maybe under the heading of ' Good Grief Movies ' of all time . Yeah , that sounds about right , something Good Old Charlie Brown would really get a kick out of . Oddly , the bank robbing couple in question ( Richard Cromwell and Helen Mack ) seemed like a charming enough pair , but they really didn't fit the Bonnie and Clyde stereotype . They were just too , well nice , I guess you could say . And what's with the insurance company detective hot on their trail while on parole ? Did you ever see Lionel Atwill in a more thankless role ? I was waiting for him to turn into this sinister boogie man as he closes in on the hundred large stash , but he remains just a peach of a guy right till the end . About the only character who had any credibility was Blackie Clayton ( Horace McMahon ) , Jimmy's ( Cromwell ) cell mate in the Big House . But even he proved to be rather inept when push came to shove . The best thing to do I guess , is watch this picture while suspending all manner of disbelief . If you sit there analyzing how nonsensical the elements of the story are you'll never get past the first ten minutes . On the plus side , it breezes by in a scant fifty three minutes ( Mill Creek Entertainment version ) , not that long to get bored , but long enough to realize that this just ain't ever gonna happen .
" I don't like to have to thank somebody too many times . "	This is a fairly obtuse Western , filmed altogether too dark and muddy that comes complemented by circus trapeze artists , midget clowns and dancing girls . There's also the hint of a homosexual flavor peppered throughout , with two shaggy males dancing cheek to cheek in an opening scene , and glistening male torsos swinging from bar to bar above the big top . It's an odd environment in which Cat Stevens ( Terence Hill ) recovers from a bullet wound while planning his revenge on an outlaw named Finch and land swindler Honey Fisher , portrayed by Victor Buono . That's about as much as I could glean from my viewing of the film , with the first third of the story a large question mark as to where things were going . It didn't help that a lot of the story seemed to be taking place in the dark , whether by accident or on purpose , with the result about the same , making it difficult to follow . As a result , the final showdown between Stevens and Finch seemed anti-climactic , as did the downfall of Fisher . Maybe a repeat viewing would help , but that's not going to happen .
" Just one thing Jason , rifles and women don't mix . "	Nor apparently , do rifles and Comanches , as the Indians are shown to be willing to fight and kill for them , or conversely , are willing to fight and kill once they have them . I couldn't help thinking while watching , as another viewer commented on this board , that here was a half century early preview of the politics of appeasement that the liberal Democrats are waging during the present day Iraqi War . Let's just give the enemy what they want and go on our way , because then they'll be satisfied and leave us alone . The story , one might surmise , stays in one place literally and figuratively for it's entire run . A broken down Conestoga wagon remains behind for a wheel to be fixed as negotiations get under way as to how to deal with the hostiles . It's unfortunate that the nominal leader of this piece , Jason Clay ( Lance Fuller ) was the one to waver in his determination to get the wagon through with one hundred Kentucky rifles intact . That resolve was maintained by sidekick Tobias ( Chill Wills ) , shown to be correct when the Comanches force their own hand by shooting their bargaining chip Foster ( Jess Barker ) . Interesting how one can see more clearly when when one's life is on the line . The sub plot of a romantic triangle among Clay , Foster and Amy Connors ( Cathy Downs ) wasn't particularly necessary for the story , and didn't wind up contributing to the finale . However it allowed for Chill Wills ' character to fire off a couple references to how women and rifles don't mix , even if the connection was virtually negligible . It seems to me the run in with the Comanches would have occurred with or without women along for the ride . I don't think it's necessary to be as hard on the flick as other posters for this film have been , but it sure did take a long time to get from Point A to Point B as has been pointed out . Sterling Holloway gets minimal mileage out of his home made still bit , and Wills is mildly entertaining with ' Sweet Bessie From Pike ' . It gets a little embarrassing though to see how much confidence he places in his own Kentucky Rifle , especially when he offers up a prayer to help him shoot straight .
" You have beaten my wife and she's gone off with another man ; you are a dirty dog . "	I'll have to admit that I'm at a disadvantage here ; when I learn more about a film from other reviewers than from watching it myself , then that's a problem . Although the plot of " The Man Who Knew Too Much " seems generally straightforward , the movie allows too many cryptic elements to get in the way of what could have been a satisfying mystery . By the time we get to the scene where a witchy looking woman establishes the secrecy of " the first degree of the seven fold ray " , I didn't know whether to laugh or rewind to see if I missed something . In retrospect , the cryptic note retrieved by Mr . Lawrence ( Leslie Banks ) from the handle of a shaving brush was a craftily written message , leading to a dentist named Barbor , and eventually to the Albert Hall , a place , not a person as indicated by " A . Hall " . But for all the intrigue , it's never made clear why the assassination target was being eliminated . Okay , so Louis Bernard was killed because he knew of a plot to assassinate a diplomat named Ropa , but why was Ropa a target ? Come to think of it , why was the note even written and secured in the shaving brush ? Did Bernard have to refer to it every now and then to remind himself what was going to happen ? With it's disjointed scenes , " The Man Who Knew Too Much " is hard to follow and a bit disorienting , however I'll give Alfred Hitchcock credit for this early effort . For perspective , I'll have to watch some of his other work of the same era , though this movie certainly can't hold a candle to his later works like " Psycho " or " North by Northwest " .
" Thank you , but I'm never coming back . "	I was rather surprised to see the IMDb overall rating of 7 . 0 for " Carnival of Souls " at the time of my posting ; the film for me straddles the line between pretentious and artsy . The lone survivor of a car driven off a bridge wanders out of the river in shock , only to be viewed in the next scene preparing to take a job as a church organist in another town . It doesn't get much more surreal than that . It's rather amusing to see the sheriff's department scouring the river for the submerged car , various folks commenting on the river's swift progress and how the muddy waters may make it impossible to ever retrieve the vehicle . The scene closes with a rather good view of the underwater vehicle , with the lights on no less . At various points in the film , Mary Henry ( Candace Hilligoss ) crosses over into a nether world where no one can see or hear her . She is menaced by the repeated sighting of a ghoulish apparition , but there doesn't seem to be any meaning attached to this particular character . At a certain point , he becomes the ring leader of a nightmarish cast of characters dancing the night away in a deserted pavilion on the edge of town , thereby at least lending credibility to the name of the film . Mary's boarding house neighbor across the hall John Linden ( Sidney Berger ) , plays his character with all the lusty alcohol induced stupor the part calls for , and then wonders why he can't seem to score with the church lady . The relationship though does set the stage for the single genuinely humorous exchange of the film - Mary : ( as John loads up his cup of Joe with a shot of alcohol ) " What's the matter , can you still taste the coffee ? " John : " Come on , whaddya think I'm an alcoholic . Look , I just like to start the day off in a good mood , that's all . " Mary : " You must be hilarious by noon . " Mary's nether world becomes too much to bear , the crossover between nightmare and reality blending together to such degree that she can no longer discern one from the other . It's at this point that Mary begins to plead for all this to be over ; this viewer at least was ready to take her up on it .
" Take it easy , you want this stuff to blow up ? "	The Bulldog Drummond franchise was a busy one with nine films in the three years from 1937 to 1939 . They generally followed a thematic line , one of those being the theft of a newly invented device that might prove useful to enemy hands . In " Bulldog Drummond's Revenge " , the gizmo in question is an explosive powder called ' haxonite ' , presumably named after it's inventor Sir Hohn Haxton ( Matthew Boulton ) . The powder is rather tricky and unpredictable , but it's theorized that enough of the crystals could blow London to bits . In very quick order , Haxton's traitorous butler Draven Nogais ( Frank Puglia ) murders the inventor aboard a plane flight , and parachutes himself and the device away from the doomed airplane . The coincidences necessary to make the film proceed are extraordinary , as Drummond and his sidekicks Algy and Tenny ( Reginald Denny , E . E . Clive ) recover the suitcase with the explosives , which conveniently falls on the road they're traveling . Back at Rockingham Lodge , the suitcase in turn is stolen by the bad guys during the old lights out trick , prompting a London to Dover escapade that have the heroes and villains trading the advantage before Drummond's team makes the save for Scotland Yard . As ever , Drummond's fiancée Phyllis Clavering ( Louise Campbell ) is left to wonder whether the wedding will ever take place , as it's constantly being interrupted by some nefarious plot or another . This time around , Miss Clavering receives consolation from Algy's wife Gwen ( Nydia Westman ) , the first time Mrs . Longworth is introduced into the filmography . The movie gets some mileage out of a rather gruesome plot device , a severed hand from Sir Haxton's plane crash . The girls do a double faint when the hand is revealed in the commotion at Rockingham when the suitcase is stolen . Rounding out the cast is John Barrymore as Colonel Nielson of Scotland Yard ; he once again gets top billing over John Howard's Drummond , as he did in their prior film " Bulldog Drummond Comes Back " . Barrymore's manner is sophisticated and professional , unlike the roles assigned to the lead authority in films of the Charlie Chan and Mr . Wong series of the same era . The comic relief as it were is left to Algy for the physical slapstick , and Tenny for the cerebral . Tenny's best deadpan line occurs early when Drummond comments on how much fun getting married ought to be ; the response - " It's a popular belief Sir . " With the case solved and the explosive powder back in safekeeping , the anticipated Drummond / Clavering wedding plans seem to be on track to survive some more adventures , and it will take a few more films to get there . There does seem to be some semblance of continuity to the development of the characters , so watching the series in the order of release is helpful to keep track of things . The movies offer a nice balance of mystery and comedy and thankfully don't take themselves too seriously .
" Please , please don't hate me for . . . , for what's happened . "	Sex delinquent ! ? ! ? - Is that what they actually called loose women back in the day ? " The Road To Ruin " is the sexploitation equivalent of those better known drug cult flicks from the 1930's like " Reefer Madness " and " Cocaine Fiends " . It purports to portray what can happen to an average teenage girl who gets caught up with the wrong crowd , resulting in a spiraling descent through the use of alcohol , drugs , and gasp ! . . . pre-marital sex ! The finale would be virtually unthinkable today , but seventy years ago , who knows ? I wouldn't doubt it if leery old abortion docs like the one in the picture had anything to do with it . This may not have some of the more over the top , goofy and contrived circumstances that the anti-drug flicks of the era might have come up with , but it plays out pretty much the same . Something unique to this one was that rather racy dice game played in the tradition of your best strip poker , followed by a steamy midnight swim . The picture offers a lot more in the way of suggestion and titillation than anything else , but it sure does get it's message across . By the time it's all over , you genuinely feel sorry for the film's main character Ann Dixon ( Helen Foster ) , but it's tempered by the totally unrealistic way the whole story ends . To catch it for yourself , look for the four disc / twenty movie DVD package titled ' Cult Classics ' from Mill Creek Entertainment at a bargain price . Fans of the genre will make a substantial addition to their film library with little known gems like this along with the titles mentioned earlier , all in one convenient place for the discriminating viewer .
" If I didn't know different stranger , I'd think I was lookin ' in a mirror ! "	You'll probably wonder as I did some time into the picture as to where exactly the ' range war ' of the title might be . Not really a problem , as almost any Western title from the 1930's and ' 40's had nothing at all to do with the story . Billy the Kid himself is presented as the film's hero rather than the famous outlaw he became . Portrayed by Bob Steele , ' The Kid ' is noticeably older than he ever got to be in real life , having died around twenty one years old ; at the time of the picture , Steele was thirty four . Bob Steele appeared as Billy The Kid in a half dozen films for Producers Releasing Corporation in the time frame , just prior to getting a call from Republic Pictures asking him to be part of the Three Mesquiteers . Al ' Fuzzy ' St . John appeared as his sidekick in these stories , and continued in the series when Steele was replaced by Buster Crabbe . The Billy character was generally presented as a good guy caught up in situations where he was wrongfully accused of some misdeed . In ' Range War ' , an outlaw impersonates Billy in a scheme where local town boss Williams ( Karl Hackett ) attempts to rid a stage line competitor from winning a mail contract from his steamship company . Conversely , Billy the Kid impersonates a henchman hired by Williams to sabotage the construction of a stage trail . I guess it sounds a lot more complicated than it plays out on screen , as Billy gets the goods on all the bad guys in short order to save the day for the stage company run by Ellen Gorman ( Joan Barclay ) . Fuzzy St . John is an effective comedy relief character backing up The Kid , getting a lot of mileage out of his trusty slingshot . He has to take his lumps too , as he gets belted hard a couple of times , including a hefty knock out blow from Billy early in the picture . Fuzzy's a trooper though , and proves a loyal ally to his partner . You'll catch a lot of the era's mainstays in the picture on both sides of the law - Carleton Young is Billy's friend , Marshal Jack Carson , while Rex Lease , Howard Masters and Buddy Roosevelt make appearances as villains or henchmen . Ultimately , the story itself winds up largely forgettable , but at least while you're watching , you'll have a good time with the story and it's characters .
" Connection complete , everything here is now ours . "	The colorful psychedelic intro during the opening credits of " They Came From Beyond Space " suggest something rather unusual might be about to happen , while the first appearance of scientist Lee Mason ( Jennifer Jayne ) and her foot tall red haired bouffant ' do definitely got my attention . And why are we intrigued by the fact that Dr . Curtis Temple has a silver plate in his head ? Temple ( Robert Hutton ) is an expert on extraterrestrial life , though I'm a bit confused on how one earns that designation , since there are no extraterrestrials around to study . He's been summoned to examine a meteor crash that has landed in Cornwall in perfect V formation , but he's denied by his superior because he's still recovering from an accident some time earlier , hence the aforementioned brain armor . Bodiless intelligent life forms take over Temple's colleagues , and create a " crimson plague " to disable other humans who are then held in a deep freeze until they can be transported to the aliens ' stronghold on the moon , where they're held to construct another ship to transport the beings to their home planet . Still with me ? The movie see saws it's way back and forth with Temple alternately a captive of the aliens and then an aggressor , as he eventually figures out that his silver plate prevents his mind from being overcome . You just know that the answer to defeating the bad guys is to fashion a helmet out of a set of silverware so his buddy can protect himself , along with a cosmic ray gun they're able to scrounge up along the way . Eventually we're introduced to Master of the Moon Zon , who's tale of woe gets Temple's attention - all they want is to get back to their home planet where they can die in peace . In his best ' All you had to do was ask ' sincerity , Temple offers Earth's assistance and the foes shake on it to bring this story to an abrupt conclusion . 1967 seems a bit late to have films like this still being made ; done in the 1950's in black and white might have given it more of a campy flavor . Still , it's not a bad diversion for it's eighty five minute run time if you're willing to give it a go . You'll have to supply your own laughs along the way though , as the film takes itself a bit more seriously than necessary .
" Well there she is - Sofio - jumpin ' off place for the scum of the South Seas . "	With a name like " Captain Calamity " , I was surprised coming out of the film at how entertaining it actually was . George Houston portrays the title character , Captain Bill Jones , who gets a lot of mileage out of a single gold doubloon . Without ever actually lying about discovering a sunken treasure , Jones ' tall tale takes on a life of it's own after the seed has been planted with a nefarious saloon keeper named Joblin ( Harold Howard ) . After that , the treasure grows with each telling of the tale , until one imagines the Schooner Marigold sinking under it's weight . To be sure , the film is not an award winner , but it is a fun adventure . George Houston , who I'd seen before in some of his Lone Rider Westerns , is much more spirited here , as he performs a host of singing numbers while grinning broadly . You never quite believe he's going to turn over his leading lady Marian Nixon to a former beau after all the commotion over the non existent gold . The best lines of the film are delivered by Captain Jones as he re-establishes his acquaintance with Joblin henchman Black Pierre . During introductions , Jones remarks - " You know of all the guys I don't like , you're the one I like most " . Later in the film Jones reaffirms his mutual trust and distrust of Pierre at the same time - " I'd be quicker to believe you than any other liar I know . . . " Besides Marian Nixon's character Madge Lewis , the film is complemented by Margaret Irving as a conniving Madame Gruen in league with the film's bad guys , and a pretty island girl named Annana . I got a kick out of her screen credit , reminiscent of one for a character in the 1970's TV series ' Hawaii Five-O " . In that one you had Zulu as ' Kono ' , and here we have Movita as ' Annana ' . My question in each case - Why couldn't they have just used their own names ? As mentioned earlier , George Houston went on to do eleven films for Producers Releasing Corporation ( PRC ) in the period 1940-1942 as ' The Lone Rider ' . Though I haven't seen any of those in which he sings , he does belt out the Lone Rider theme song over that series ' opening credits . Houston's voice was by some estimates just a bit too formal and booming for lowly ' B ' Westerns , but in ' Calamity ' , he does sound pretty good ; that salt sea air does wonders . As time goes by , little known titles like " Captain Calamity " seem to be finding a wider audience with assorted compilations . I found it as part of a ten film , three DVD ' Pirates ' set recently released by St . Clair Vision , which has also put together similar collections in other genres . It's a terrific way to spend a few hours at a very reasonable price ( under ten dollars ) , and get to see a lot of actors before they became big name Hollywood stars .
" That sounds like trouble . Let's find out . "	" Colorado Serenade " opens and closes with Eddie Dean on horseback singing " Home on the Range " , though he trades partner Roscoe Ates for love interest Sherry Lynn ( Mary Kenyon ) by the end of the film . In between , Eddie and Soapy ( Ates ) help a trouble shooting circuit judge find a long lost son and bring justice to Rawhide City . When you see them both together , it's remarkable how much Dean and Ates look alike , with Roscoe being an older version . The Soapy character was actually Dean's second screen comedic sidekick , Emmett " Pappy " Lynn worked with Eddie in earlier films . In the story , a cowpoke named Nevada ( David Sharpe ) goes undercover to infiltrate a gang that may be robbing gold shipments . At first , Eddie is unaware of Nevada's role , and they really bang it out in a wild saloon fight that's one of the more realistic ones you'll see in a ' B ' Western . Later , it's revealed that the mastermind behind the gold robberies is the same villain who Judge Hilton ( Forrest Taylor ) put in jail thirty years earlier . " Dad " Dillon ( Warner Richmond ) kidnapped the judge's son when he broke out and raised him as his own . " Duke " Dillon is now the town boss of Rawhide City , who'll learn his true origin just before he eats dust at the hands of " Dad " . Eddie Dean began his film career in the mid 1930's , appearing in back up roles to Hopalong Cassidy . Prior to that , he made his mark as part of a singing trio on Gene Autry's Melody Ranch Radio Program . Dean has his backers that will claim he was the best of the singing cowboys , and that's probably not far from the truth . " Colorado Serenade " showcases his talent quite well with a host of songs , and he finishes one up with a low key yodel . While many movie cowboys were synonymous with their horses , Dean chose to appear with four different steeds in his films , on the assumption that he wouldn't be upstaged by any of them . His mount in this picture is a palomino named White Cloud . Actually , Dean had a reputation for being fairly generous with his fellow actors , allowing them center stage when the story called for it . A final bit of trivia - though other Westerns were made before in color , Eddie Dean was the first to do a series of films in color , with five films for PRC in the 1940's . On that account , he managed to beat Roy and Gene to the draw .
" This is no police station , it's a sanitarium . "	Dead bodies have been washing ashore on the banks of the Thames River , and Scotland Yard has so far done very little to solve the mystery . With marching orders to investigate the crimes , if there are any , Inspector Larry Holt ( Hugh Williams ) makes his way to the Dearborn Institute for the Blind , home to a grotesque array of characters supervised by a blind man himself , Professor John Dearborn . Holt is aided by a detective on loan from the Chicago police force , Lieutenant O'Reilly ( Edmon Ryan ) . " The Human Monster " is aptly named , as Bela Lugosi portrays a truly sinister and hideous character , Dr . Feodor Orloff , who runs an insurance scam by backing policies for indigent residents of the institute , and then turning them into corpses to collect upon their deaths . His latest victim however , Henry Stuart , is retrieved from the Thames with a piece of braille writing in his pocket , linking his disappearance to the institute . Bela Lugosi turns in a truly malevolent performance as Orloff ; in a particularly chilling sequence , he dispatches a victim by drowning him in a vat of water , and then gleefully tossing him out the doors of the institute into the muddy river . Eventually we learn that Lugosi has a dual role in the film , as he removes the phony dark glasses and wig of Professor Dearborn . As the authorities close in , he makes a final stand only to be outdone by his gruesome assistant named Jake , a comically hideous creature who becomes enraged when the doctor dispatches one of the men he had been caring for . " The Human Monster " is pure grade " B " schlock horror , but if you're a fan of this genre as I am , you'll have some fun with it , though you'll have to plow through some slow going at times , even for a film that clocks in at seventy six minutes . The presence of pretty Greta Gynt helps , as she portrays the daughter of the murdered Henry Stuart , and almost falls victim herself to the evil Orloff . The U . S . working title " The Human Monster " seems much more apt than the original release name - " The Dark Eyes of London " .
" Your ears are like a fox Bwana Jim . . . "	As a kid growing up , I'd watch Johnny Weismuller's Tarzan movies every chance I got , but I can't recall ever seeing any of his Jungle Jim films . TV quality in the 1950's was a dicey affair , and you never knew if antenna reception would be favorable or not . The only other jungle adventures I can recall seeing were those of " Ramar of the Jungle " and " Sheena : Queen of the Jungle " ; something about those jungle flicks and wild animals that captured my imagination . Having just gotten my hands on a bunch of the Jungle Jim movies , I'll be watching them in order of release to see how the series progressed . In this , the first movie of the franchise , Jungle Jim leads an expedition to locate the legendary ancient temple of Zimbalu following the discovery of a vial made of pure gold . Of more significance though is the vial's contents , a poison that might hold the key to a cure for polio . That's of special interest to Dr . Hilary Parker ( Virginia Grey ) , who's willing to brave the dangerous trek into the wild for the secrets Zimbalu may hold . For those whose only experience of George Reeves is that of Superman in the 1950's TV series , one might be surprised to see him cast here as villain Bruce Edwards , especially when he tries to push Jungle Jim over a cliff feigning a dizzy spell . Something I could never figure out , even as a kid , was how movies featuring lots of wildlife found it impossible to maintain geographical integrity for those that appeared in the story . Here , it didn't take long for a North American mountain lion to show up along the expedition trail . Granted , it was stock footage , as were virtually all of the animal scenes , but I did get a kick out of the wild elephant stampede . The opener with Jim wrestling the leopard was a little more realistic looking than I would have expected . Say , here's a few questions that crossed my mind while watching . Why was everyone so surprised that Dr . Hilary turned out to be a woman , I mean she had a woman's name , didn't she ? And if Kolu ( Rick Vallin ) was the chief of his Masai tribe , how did the tribe get along without him while he was off serving as Jungle Jim's guide ? Then in one of the film's goofier moments , why would Edwards , who made his escape from the Zimbalu warriors out of the temple , wind up coming back ? Not a good career move as it turned out . Is it just me , or did Zia's ( Lita Baron ) fireside dance remind anyone else of that ' Seinfeld ' episode where Elaine does the goofy dance ? Still , as far out as this story tends to get , there's nothing like it for good campy fun , except of course for stuff like Flash Gordon , the Adventures of Superman , and a good dose of the Bowery Boys . Not a bad way to escape reality for a quick hour at a time . Say , I don't recall Jungle Jim's last name ever being mentioned in the story - it was Bradley .
Ever hear a polka in a Western ?	If you've seen one Durango Kid movie , you've seen them all . Here's the deal - in the opening sequence , the Durango Kid rides into town in the guise of his alter-ego . His name usually changes from film to film ; in " Snake River Desperados " , he goes by Steve Reynolds . Within the first fifteen minutes , we're treated to a humorous Smiley Burnette song . Sometimes Smiley knows the new man in town , sometimes he doesn't . However at some point they manage to form a casual alliance and go about righting the wrong of the movie . In this case , rancher Jim Haverly ( Monte Blue ) feigns friendliness to a band of Indians , while inciting his fellow ranchers to inflict damage to the town while dressed up as redskins . Then , Haverly gets to have it both ways by selling guns to Chief Black Eagle , hoping to create a vicious spiral of events . The Durango Kid is on top of things though , and is aided by two young boys , one an Indian named Little Hawk , and the other the nephew of villain Haverly . Meanwhile , the affable Smiley and his fellow musicians ( The Silver Coronet Band ! ) dress up in their new uniforms and perform , get this - a polka ! Burnette is always good for two , sometimes even three musical numbers per show . It's all spirited fun as the the guilty parties are finally uncovered , and The Durango Kid gets to move on to another town , another meeting with Smiley Burnette , and another mission accomplished . If you like this film , ( and I do enjoy these , even if the plot never changes ) , seek out the Durango films with early film appearances by Clayton Moore and Jock Mahoney . Occasionally Dub Taylor provides the comic relief in place of Smiley Burnette .
" When hoss thieves hear me comin ' , they march right up with a rope around their neck ! "	I got a kick out of this Roy Rogers film , and mostly for elements not even connected to the story per se . For example , the name of Buzz Henry's character in the picture goes by Bobby Blake , and I thought to myself , wouldn't it have been cool if the REAL Bobby Blake ( Robert Blake , that is ) was cast as a character with his own name ? It would have been possible too , since the young Buzz Henry was eleven years old when he appeared in the picture . At the time , Blake ( the real one ) would have been nine , so it probably wouldn't have been too much of a stretch to make that happen . Instead , Blake ( the real one ) made his mark in Westerns as Red Ryder's sidekick in the series of movies that started with " Riders of Death Valley " in 1944 ; Blake was Ryder's sidekick Little Beaver . Then there's Roy Rogers ' title song that's first heard as a recording when Bobby spins a couple of tunes on his record player . I thought that was pretty unique , at least it was the first time I'd seen that done to introduce the lead player . Rogers himself doesn't appear for a few more scenes , so that was a cool way to get his presence into the movie a bit earlier . A good deal of the fun in this one is provided by a running feud between Gabby Hayes and Pat Brady as a member of the Sons of the Pioneers . Each believes the other is deaf based on false information intentionally planted by Roy and Bob Nolan , so they go through the picture shouting at each other in comic fashion . Brady provides some more merriment when he gets to sing lead in a jail house tune later in the story . As for Gabby , he tries hard to build on his reputation as a ' professional rustler catcher ' , even if one wonders how many rustlers there might have been in that hazy modern Western era where 1880's sensibility collides with such technology as automobiles , radio and electrical appliances . The 1940's was a curious time for Westerns as this stuff pops up all the time in the films of Roy Rogers and Gene Autry , but it usually turns out fairly entertaining as it does here . If you hadn't figured it out by now ( unless you've seen the film ) , the story involves a gang of rustlers operating in a milieu where wild herds are being rounded up on reservations and bred with ranch thoroughbreds as part of a government experiment . The rustlers spring into action whenever a particular song is played during the Lariat Lodge entertainment broadcast . Inadvertently , the Pioneers are drawn into this ruse when they perform " Blue Prairie " during a one night stand at the Lodge . That actually rounds out another interesting point about the movie's principal players - when introduced , the singing group is introduced as Roy Rogers and the Sons of The Pioneers . I hope Bob Nolan didn't feel too bad about that one !
" If I saw this on television I'd never believe it ! "	Bob Hope plays a dual role in this comedy spy flick , one as his usual character throwing out humorous one liners , and the other as an international spy who Peanuts White ( Hope ) is asked to imitate in order to secure a valuable piece of film for the government . Hope actually looked a bit scary as the villain Eric Augustine , and it made me wonder if he could have pulled off a dramatic role in a non comedy vehicle . This was my first glimpse of Hedy Lamarr , and I wasn't too impressed with her looks when she first appeared on screen . But then , it seemed like she got better looking as the movie progressed . By the time of the film's finale and that wild hook and ladder ride , the zaniness of the scene seemed to bring out a naturalness to her personality that seemed suppressed in the early going . Actually , that scene had elements of Abbott and Costello and the Keystone Kops going for it , and was a lot more physical than any other Hope characterization I've seen . As usual , some of Hope's best zingers are of the self deprecatory kind ; when one of the detectives removes his clown rubber nose in the early going , Hope's character replies - " Hey , that's not all putty " ! You have to be quick when he does the gag about Bing Crosby , never mentioning him by name , but remarking how a skull he's looking at resembles a ' singer I know ' . Modern audiences and non-Hope fans would never give it a second thought , but it's one of the fun things about watching these era films when you're old enough to be in on the joke . Hey , I know it's just for laughs , but there was a goof in that scene when the phone started ringing inside the suitcase . When Peanuts / Hope finally gets it out , the receiver is off the hook ! " My Favorite Spy " seems to get mixed reviews , and though I enjoyed it myself , I thought about it being re-done as " Road to Tangier " with Crosby and Lamour along for the ride . Say , did you catch it when Peanuts White's real name was revealed ? - it was Cecil Longwood .
" Smart ? He's weird . I tell ' ya , if I didn't know better I'd swear we were doing business with Boris Karloff . "	I got a great kick out of the line Dick Tracy's detective assistant Pat Patton ( Lyle Latell ) used referencing the star of the film . It's the second time I know of when Boris Karloff or one of his characters is called by name in a movie . In " Charlie Chan At The Opera " , a stage manager responds to a ruckus in the theater by proclaiming - " This opera is going on tonight even if Frankenstein walks in ! " " Dick Tracy Meets Gruesome " is a wonderful take on the comic strip of the 1940's and ' 50's as I remember them . You always had those great play on word names for characters ; here two of the principals are Dr . A . Tomic and his aide I . M . Learned , while Boris Karloff as Gruesome takes up with a gangster named Lee Thal . When Tracy investigates a taxidermy parlor later in the film , a sign reveals the name of the owner as Y . Stuffum . It's too bad audiences of today are too sophisticated to find the fun in this kind of punditry . At the center of the story is a newly discovered gas formula that renders it's victims motionless , and comes in handy for Gruesome in pulling off a bank job . That scene brought to mind an episode of ' The Twilight Zone ' which would have come out some years later ; if memory serves that story also took place in a bank . The plot didn't seem to hold together all too consistently as to the effectiveness of the gas formula . In the warehouse scene when Gruesome attempts to render Tracy motionless to capture him , the villain enters the area where he set off the gas capsule shortly after with no ill effect . The film's windup which follows had Tracy and Gruesome in a bit of a contrived cat and mouse game exchanging gunfire . The elevator hauling the villain off to the furnace had me a bit nervous but fortunately justice wasn't carried that far . For his part , Ralph Byrd as Dick Tracy reminded me a little bit of actor Pat O'Brien . Tracy's girlfriend Tess Trueheart was played fetchingly by Anne Gwynne , and rounding out the bad guy cast were Skelton Knaggs as X-Ray and Tony Barrett as piano player Melody . This is the first Dick Tracy film I've seen , and it had enough of the Chester Gould comic strip fun to suggest looking up some of the other titles . As a fan of the genre , I found it to compare favorably to other detective series of the era , notably Charlie Chan , Bulldog Drummond and Mr . Moto . For a decidedly different view of Boris Karloff , try catching him in any one of the five films he starred in portraying the Oriental Detective Mr . Wong .
" Once a jailbird , always a jailbird . "	This fairly standard Western features cowboy star Tim Holt and perennial sidekick Chito Rafferty ( Richard Martin ) as a pair of ranch hands who spend a lot of time trying to prove a recently released ex-con is trying to go straight . They manage to get him a job on the Bar Circle Ranch owned by Gail Martin ( Joan Dixon ) , who eventually becomes the love interest for Dave Collins ( Ross Elliott ) . The main heavy is Turk Thorne , portrayed by John Dehner , trying to make one big score of a gold shipment on the train that runs through Trail Head , Arizona . Collins used to be mixed up with Thorne's gang , and that's what wound him up in the State Penitentiary . Thorne's plan is to spring him legitimately , and set him up in the telegraph office to intercept the time that a big payday will come through town . Holt's counter plan is to play along with Thorne's scheme , but be there with Sheriff Lacy ( Kenneth MacDonald ) to nail the bad guys and prove Collins is one regular fella . There are a few hitches along the way , but rest assured the good guys prevail , and the romantic duo of Dave and Gail hook up in the end . Richard Martin provides his usual comedic malapropisms as Chito , he has something to say about " tenderhorns " and " greenfoots " in this one . And as usual , he has a never ending eye for the ladies , but doesn't get to see many this time around . Tim Holt had a nominally successful career with a string of " B " Westerns with the coolest sounding titles , like " Storm Over Wyoming " , " Thunder Mountain " , and " Under the Tonto Rim " . However the most memorable film he ever appeared in was a neat little title from 1948 , starring Humphrey Bogart . You may have heard of it - " The Treasure of the Sierra Madre " .
" You have to catch the spider Inspector , not the web . "	The style and direction of the movie reminded me of the later British Hitchcock films as well as some of the Sherlock Holmes flicks of the 1930's and ' 40's , even though this German movie was made in 1961 . The quality of the print I viewed also seemed to place it as an older film by a couple of decades , but in that regard it added to the atmosphere of the story . I'm not familiar with the prior Mabuse films as most of the other posters on this board are , so my review isn't influenced by those other works . Of course the mystery lies in the identity of the title character , regularly mentioned but never seen , with hints of his previous demise and possible after life as a ghost of some sort . The voice of Mabuse makes contact at various times with Inspector Lohmann ( Gert Frobe ) and a mysterious contact who could be an undercover policeman or a mob contact from a Chicago based syndicate . It's not enough that Lex Barker goes by Joe Como and Nick Scappio , but later takes on a third guise as Bob Arco . I thought Mabuse figured out his identity just a little too easily with the Maria hostage ruse ; I would have thought the character would be more wary of a trick like that . I was a bit surprised to see that gruesome flamethrower death scene near the beginning of the story , particularly involving a woman . When a similar apparatus appeared later on with Maria ( Dahlia Lavi ) as a target I caught myself wincing a bit . I would have hated to see her go out like that . The story takes enough twists and turns to make it rather hard to follow as it nears the finale , and the payoff as to the identity of Mabuse came off as a downer actually since he wasn't a character introduced earlier in the story . There was enough mis-direction in the picture to suggest Mabuse as any number of people like Warden Wolf , the creepy Bohmler , or even Maria's father the Professor . Come to think of it , the Professor said he WAS Mabuse , and you kept watching for that to play itself out to no avail . So having Mabuse show up as someone else altogether was a bit of a disconnect for me . I did come away though wondering , as did Lohmann , that perhaps Mabuse found a way to escape his fate in a way that Sherlock Holmes ' nemesis Professor Moriarty managed to do on more than one occasion .
" Too late for a doctor , this boy's a fixin ' to die . "	Sorry I can't share the same enthusiasm for this film that prior reviewers have , but it seems to muddle from scene to scene in search of the righteous revenge angle that never quite materializes . The protagonist , Jet Cosgrave ( John Derek ) , never evokes the kind of sympathy one would expect for his cause , because even though he was swindled out of ownership of his father's ranch , he only seems one track minded on doing away with his uncle The Major ( Jim Davis ) . Along the way , he can't seem to keep his hands off the ladies , and I get the impression that if Mrs . Banner was a little younger , he might have tried to kiss her too . I guess where I lost empathy for Jet was when he failed to deal with his hired gun Dude Rankin ( Bob Steele ) for the shooting of the camp cook at the line ranch . It was almost like , ' well that wasn't a cool thing to do , but a purpose was served so we'll let it slide ' . Check the scene right after Jet admonishes Rankin , saying he's to do what he's paid for and not more ; as Jet turns his horse to ride away , the horse hits Rankin in the head ! I was surprised that wasn't a do over . You know what perplexed me - the showdown that I expected to occur between Jet and the Major the first time was interrupted by the love triangle , and the Major didn't do anything but hang out waiting for something to happen . Not very believable when he was already worked up enough to face off against his nephew . Then when it was set up again , attorney Devlin interfered to prevent a more satisfying resolution . In their own way , the only characters that seemed to maintain their integrity as bad boys were the gun for hire ranch bosses , Cal Prince ( James Millican ) and Dude Rankin . Oh yeah , and kudos to Curly too for remaining true to his principles and not selling out his boss ; what else would you expect from an actor named Nacho Galindo ? At least there was that cool fist fight on horseback between Jet and The Dude , I've never seen that before . Just about everything else though was pretty much by the book for a ' B ' oater . For a better John Derek effort in a Western , I would recommend checking out the 1957 picture , " Fury at Showdown " . It's got better atmosphere as a black and white film , a great bar room brawl , and an effective early appearance by Nick Adams .
" Well learn and live , huh kid ? "	Right out of the gate , this movie had an almost impossible hurdle to overcome by invoking the name of " High Noon " , so it shouldn't come as any surprise that the result was somewhat disappointing . Had the film makers gone for an entirely different premise , you might have had a reasonably interesting Western . However comparisons with the original were virtually assured by touting the ' Return of Will Kane , and when you throw that challenge at the viewer , you've got to expect to take your lumps . Back in 1952 , when Gary Cooper threw his marshal's badge into the dirt in Hadleyville , he was a fifty one year old actor , so I wasn't expecting to see Lee Majors show up a full decade younger . At least Katherine Cannon's portrayal of Mrs . Kane didn't give way to the same reverse aging process as her husband . I really have to wonder why the casting gurus went with this strategy , as it bothered me pretty much throughout the picture . About the only scene that captured my imagination was that saloon showdown when Will Kane first met Ben Irons ( David Carradine ) , and he winds up bluffing the villain and his sidekick Emmett ( Charles Benton ) into backing down . The picture could have used some more creativity like that , but wound up being a pretty standard Western the rest of the way . Pernell Roberts ' turn as sheriff J . D . Ward was fairly successful , having his bases covered as an all around bad guy . I did a quick sit up and take notice when he ordered his black deputy ( J . A . Preston ) to " Fetch your people " to form a posse , thereby adding racist to the list of his other endearing qualities . The idea that Kane would take up with outlaw Irons to protect him from Marshal Ward was generally handled OK , although more than once I wondered why Irons wouldn't have tried to make his own getaway . Of course everything that happened in the story prefaced the final showdown between Kane and Ward , with the point of Ward's mastery of long range sharp shooting about to be tested . The serving of the warrant gimmick was one of the more effective endings to a final gun battle that I've seen , so you can score another plus for the picture there . But once again , without the clock , without the train tracks and with no mounting tension to speak of , this poor man's version of " High Noon " simply failed to satisfy . And if I didn't hear it with my own ears , I wouldn't have believed that the final score would go spaghetti .
" We're starting from scratch . You're a duchess without dough , and I'm a millionaires without a mill " .	With the start of each Bob Hope movie , I begin my countdown as to when Bing Crosby might make a characteristic unscheduled appearance . So imagine my surprise when all of a sudden Jack Benny pops up in a typical skinflint role offering to change a hundred dollar bill for Hope's character . Hope's reaction to whether it was really the perennial thirty nine year old - " Naw , he wouldn't be traveling first class " . You just had to be there during television's Golden Age to make much sense of that scene , which leads me to consider that modern day viewers miss a lot of the in jokes that comedians like Hope , Benny and Crosby were known and caricatured for back in the day . And you know something else ? - they all did it without being off color or offensive , even if they managed to offer up a double entendre or three . That's why I keep going back to their films and TV specials , a neat time capsule reminder of life during a simpler time when we could all laugh at ourselves and each other without the politically correct deterrence of possibly offending someone . As for cameos , it probably wouldn't have passed for one at the time , because George Reeves hadn't achieved notoriety yet as the Man of Steel . However it was pretty cool to see him in an opening scene , even if it didn't end so well for his character . Now here's a line that had me doing some quick research . Duchess Alexandria ( Rhonda Fleming ) remarks to Freddie Hunter ( Hope ) , that " Someday I hope to have seven little boys " . It wasn't till some six years later that Hope would star in the biographical film " The Seven Little Foys " - a strange bit of cosmic serendipity . I wonder if Hope ever thought about that ? The odd thing for me about the story had to do with Hope's alliance with the Boy Foresters in the picture ; for all intents and purposes they were a knockoff of the Boy Scouts , with an oath that was somewhat similar . I wasn't counting , but Hope's character probably managed to break most of the rules regarding Forester behavior . The boys of course , try to keep him on the straight and narrow with mixed results . But then again , who wouldn't stray with Rhonda Fleming on board . With a title like " The Great Lover " , one might expect a bit more in the romance department , but this one is played more for laughs and Hope's quick wit . It's not one of the legendary comedian's best or well known films , but Hope fans will enjoy it , and that after all , is why we tune in .
" Well I've known some men that tried to cash in on bein ' crazy " .	" The Gunman From Bodie " is the second in a series of eight Rough Riders films from Monogram Studios that paired three aging veterans of ' B ' Western flicks from the Twenties and Thirties - Buck Jones , Tim McCoy and Ray Hatton . The trio had a pretty cool chemistry together in the RR flicks , and the stories themselves were decently written with good production values . This one takes it's name from Buck Jones ' character - Bob ' Bodie ' Bronson , an alias he assumes to smoke out a passel of villains masterminded by Larabie town boss Wyatt ( Robert Frazer ) . The story actually has a fairly intricate plot that you have to pay attention to as you follow the action , as Bodie's smokescreen identity as a bad guy is the only one known to most of the players . He manages to pull off the ruse nicely while having to think on his feet as a few curves are thrown his way . The further you go back in time , the more comical it sounds to hear one of those cliché lines that were parodied in the Warner Brothers cartoons of a decade or two later . In this case , I'm thinking of bad guy Bill Cook ( John Merton ) , who when pressed by Marshall McCall ( Tim McCoy ) in the bar scene , declares - " One move and I'll let ya have it " . Actually , I thought it was pretty dumb for McCoy's character to let Cook get the upper hand the way he did , even if only momentarily . But I did get a kick out of the marshal's hanging story . I also got a kick out of the way Tim McCoy strikes those affecting postures whenever he's at the center of a scene , as if recalling moments of past glory . I guess it was a way for him to convey equal status between himself and Buck Jones , who was top billed in these Monogram featurettes . You have to admit , he did look cool in all black , especially with the outer frock coat . The theme for virtually all of the Rough Riders films follow a similar basic pattern - Buck assumes an alias as his partners , all fellow marshals , get enough on the bad guys to bring them all to justice by the finale . In this one , that sentiment is echoed by Circle B ranch foreman Joe Martin ( Dave O'Brien ) , who after suffering his share of lumps in the story , winds up with the assessment - " And to think the three of ya were workin ' together right along ! "
" We drank heavily and fought over the women . . . "	I found the film to be strangely surreal , relating as it does the life on Pitcairn Island for the descendants of Fletcher Christian and his fellow mutineers from the ' Bounty ' . After setting Captain Bligh and eighteen of his men adrift in the ocean , Christian and his crew found solace and a life on Pitcairn , seemingly welcomed by the native inhabitants with which they formed an ongoing community . Virtually invisible to ocean going steamers as late as the 1930's , one hundred sixty years of inbreeding among the island's inhabitants is presented as a virtual idyllic utopia . Told in a documentary style with inserted dramatizations of the mutiny , it appears the picture was put together as sort of a travelogue by Expeditionary Films , whose stated goal at the beginning of the story was to take the viewer to strange and exotic places . In that respect it seems to succeed , and I imagine viewers of the time might have marveled at it's story . By the same token , it leaves out large chunks of the Bounty's history , thereby blurring the distinctions between fiction and fact . Going in , I was intrigued by this being Errol Flynn's first movie role . In fact , his first appearance on screen is almost comical , somewhat in a ' Saturday Night Live ' kind of way . His role thankfully is presented in the limited flashback scenarios that paint a picture of the mutiny and the angst he experienced as a result . For those interested in swordplay , you might better sit this one out . Considering the film was made in 1933 I was rather impressed with Charles Chauvel's direction and story of this South Seas tale . It's wondrous and weird at the same time and will likely make you thankful for your present circumstances . For anyone wondering what it might be like to live on a secluded tropical island , this is quite the eye opener .
" They haven't invented a medal yet for those people . "	Humprey Bogart is a doctor with the Mobile Army Surgical Hospital , MASH Unit # 8666 , in a non comedy preview of the more notable TV Series of the early 1970's . The early going in the film really left me disoriented when the unit's encampment undergoes strafing fire , while more than once and clearly visible , a warplane bearing USAF markings is shown flying by . Seems to me like someone should have caught that . Besides some interesting scenes portraying the daily life and death struggles of a Korean War medical team , the story follows Major Jed Webbe's ( Bogey ) romancing of a newly assigned nurse , Lt . Ruth McGara ( June Allyson ) . However there's nothing subtle about Webbe's approach , and it's surprising that McGara allows this affair to blossom considering how much of a chauvinist the Major turns out to be . In fact , he's a genuine creep when you get right down to it . Keenan Wynn is fairly effective as Sgt . Orvil Statt , competently running the basic mechanics of the unit , with impressive views of breaking down and setting up camp . Robert Keith is the no nonsense Lt . Col . Walters , who takes Webbe down a peg for getting drunk on his own time , and later offers him a drink after a particularly hairy operation . War is hell . You'll have to really pay attention to the only attempt at comic relief here , since it's a visual - the sign underneath the camp cook's serving table states " This Mess Recommended by Romanoff " . Humphrey Bogart made a number of war films , but much like the Westerns in which he appeared , this just doesn't appear to be his element . He was much better suited for the gangster and noir dramas that made him famous , and " Casablanca " didn't hurt either . Here , with his age showing through , he seemed entirely mismatched with the younger June Allyson , whose clout as a leading lady here is much subdued . With only one tense scene involving a Korean prisoner ( Philip Ahn ) threatening to blow up a grenade in an operating room , the film offers no defining moments and very little battle action . In fact , the movie doesn't really even have an ending . As the MASH Unit detours it's way around an active battle zone , all you have left is Bogey and Allyson walking off into the sunset as it were , perhaps wondering what might have happened if the grenade went off .
" Put the hose on him , put the fire out , and put him in the dungeon . "	" Abbott and Costello Go To Mars " is one of the better remembered films from my childhood , along with their romp with Frankenstein , and other Million Dollar Movie favorites like " Godzilla " and " King Kong " . Perhaps it was the memorable New Orleans Mardi Gras setting with it's outlandish cast of costumed " martians " , it would have been an even better visual treat in color . It's pure and simple fun , and doesn't use a lot of scientific mumbo jumbo to explain space flight , unless you rely on the comments by a couple of Orville's ( Costello ) young friends in the opening scene . The fact that the boys never do get to Mars is easily overlooked , particularly as they get sidetracked by a couple of bank robbers and take off for Venus . There we get an early look at the 1950's version of a Star Wars type land speeder , and get to see Venusian girls testing their accuracy in a game using saucers that pre-date the Frisbee . Presiding over the man-less Venusian landscape is Queen Allura , portrayed by Mari Blanchard and looking nothing short of gorgeous . Universal could have done a lot worse than populating the movie with an array of Miss Universe contestants . The funniest bit for me was probably meant to be serious ; as the boys take off in their rocket for the second time , Dr . Wilson ( Robert Paige ) needs only about one second on a slide rule device to determine the ship is heading to Venus - huh , how'd he do that ? Then there was the comment made by Orville when confronted by a foggy landscape in an unknown world - " Being I can't see a foot in front of me , I'd say it's Los Angeles . " Wow , I didn't think L . A . became known for it's smog until the sixties ! It's a shame that as time goes by , movies like " A & C Go To Mars " have less and less of an audience . It's charm lies in it's wholesome fare from a simpler time that doesn't have a message , without pretending to be anything more than fun . I think I'll get me a Venusian balloon .
" What I think up here , I think two , three , minutes ahead of you . . . "	I have to side with the naysayers here , if you've seen enough Westerns , there's no escaping the fact that this one is nothing special . Perhaps notable for an early treatment of rape in cinema , even that theme gets botched by the overtly one track randiness of henchman Gant ( John Quade ) . Once the attempt is made though , you have to wonder why Barbara Hershey's character doesn't seem the least bit traumatized , never mind the non response of her fiancée Brickman ( Christopher Mitchum ) . This could have been a taut psychological Western , what with the setup of the characters portrayed by Charlton Heston and James Coburn . Ultimately though , they seem to rather routinely go through their motions , former lawman Burgade ( Heston ) somewhat convincing as he reads Provo ( Coburn ) like a book , but as it turns out , Provo never even tries to throw him a curve . Say , how is it Burgade at one point has trouble getting up on his horse , but then winds up taking four bullets from Provo at point blank range and a nasty hard a - - bump off a rock ledge , and still manage to survive ? I'd give him till the closing credits finish rolling . At one point , as the hunt proceeds through Indian reservation territory , Heston's character remarks to his daughter's fiancée - " Everybody's gotta die , nobody's gotta give up " . Sorry to say however , the film does both .
" Well that makes it more interestin ' when the competition's good . "	" Trouble in Texas " appears to be a re-working of the 1934 Lone Star Pictures film , " The Man From Utah " , starring John Wayne ; both were directed by Robert North Bradbury and both utilize the excellent stunt work of Yakima Canutt . In fact , Yak's character in both pictures is pretty much the same , he portrays a champion rodeo rider who's part of a gang of racketeers that insures their top man wins most of the top prize money . Serious challengers never get a chance , usually winding up dead under mysterious circumstances . Tex Ritter acquits himself well in this film , his character is Tex Masters , and he rides the rodeo circuits in hopes of catching up with the gang responsible for his brother's murder five years earlier . But the real bright star of this film is a lovely young lady by the name of Rita Cansino , you might know her better as Rita Hayworth . It's stunning to see how lovely she looks , portraying undercover government agent Carmen Serano who tries to get the goods on the gang by working them from the inside . She's hired by rodeo racketeer Barker ( perennial baddie Earl Dwire ) , and before it's over she gets to show some early singing and dancing talent in an entertaining saloon number . Much of the movie's screen time is taken up by rodeo stock footage , with your standard roping and bulldogging , and a fair amount of native Indian parade and dance . When it comes time for the actual contests , Tex manages to out ride , out rope and outdo his main opponent for the prize money in every event , " Squint " Palmer ( Canutt ) . The gang is unsuccessful in having Masters fall for the old poison needle in the halter trick , but coincidentally , that's how Tex's brother died , so now he's got the goods on all the bad boys , enough for the Middleton sheriff ( Glenn Strange ) to put them all away for good . Quite coincidentally , the same ruse was used in " The Man From Utah " , only the poison needle was positioned in the saddle to do it's dirty work . I get a kick out of the pre-1950 Westerns where the good guy , in this case Tex Ritter , can shoot a gun out of the hand of an opponent , and not have the bullet find it's mark in another person directly in the line of fire . The Lone Ranger would consistently do the same , finding his target and only his target , even when firing right into the middle of a crowd . Horace Murphy offers up some comic relief in the movie as Tex's sidekick Lucky , his gimmick is talking up his non existent heroics in sort of a Gabby Hayes style , but he doesn't have the on screen charisma of a Gabby , or even a Smiley Burnette , kind of a poor man's " pardner " . I got " Trouble in Texas " as a double bill DVD along with Tex Ritter's " Arizona Days " ; available for a buck in one of the dollar chain stores - definitely a bargain for Tex fans , or if you just want to sample Ritter's work without laying out major cash . Of the two , " Trouble " alone will be worth your trouble , especially for the surprising appearance of gorgeous Rita Hayworth .
" Every day above ground is a good day . "	Finally , after watching literally hundreds of westerns , score one for the bad guy ! Bruce Dern's character is Jack Strawhorn , a savvy train robber with enough sense in the early going to know that his gang was second best to Marshal Howard Nightingale's ( Kirk Douglas ) lawmen . Savvy enough also to allow himself to be captured than to foolishly throw down with Nightingale when he had the upper hand . Strawhorn's capture virtually assures Nightingale of an election win for a U . S . Senate seat , a position he's angling for with a lot more ambition on his mind than simply serving the people . As the story plays out though , things get a whole lot murkier , so much so that the finale winds up totally at odds with any sense of credibility . Granted , Nightingale's men spend a fair amount of time worrying about what will happen to them should he pack up for Washington , D . C . Here's what bothers me though - whose payroll were they actually on to begin with ? They were uniformed officers and all wore stars ; Nightingale's title was that of a Marshal . So why wouldn't they have remained no worse off than their present circumstances ? I can understand them shaking down the town to save the life of their boss , but then to turn around and split up the money just because Strawhorn suggested it just doesn't make sense to me . Other than the ending that proved a letdown for this viewer , the film does have some fine points to offer . The cinematography is more than adequate , and the hijacked train on fire was an exciting touch . There are also two outstanding scenes where horses go above and beyond the call of duty . The first involves a mount going over a cliff and into the water at the Mexican camp , and later when Styrawhorn attempts his getaway from the train on horseback . How does one get a horse to take those crazy spills ? Pay attention to the scene when Strawhorn plans his breakout on the train . He rigs a garrote from a piece of wire taken apart from a broom and lashes Wesley ( Bo Hopkins ) tightly by the neck to the bars of the cell . Later when Wesley answers Strawhorn's call to come to his room where Nightingale is kept hostage , there isn't even the slightest hint of redness or abrasion on his neck from the event . One other comment bears mentioning that came across unintentionally funny . The train bearing Nightingale's posse is clearly marked as the Texas and Arizona Rail Road . While stationed at the town of Tesota , three of Nightingale's randy men entertain women folk of the town in secluded quarters . Interestingly , there's a shot of one of the train cars with the abbreviated name - ' T . & A . R . R . ' For Wesley and the boys , it certainly was .
" He couldn't track an elephant in five feet of snow ! "	In the oddest of coincidences , this is the second Western in a row I've watched , picked entirely at random , to take place in a town called Red Bluff . The other was the 1942 Rough Riders picture , " Riders of the West " . I don't recall the state ever being mentioned in the stories , but a quick Google search brought up a bunch of hits for Red Bluff , California . " Harmony Trail " has a pretty interesting team up between star Ken Maynard , Eddie Dean , and Max Terhune , and it made me wonder whether this was one of the traditional Western ' B ' trios that became a staple of the genre . Terhune had been a member of The Three Mesquiteers , but in this case , it was simply a matter of putting a number of top draws together . Actually , for Maynard , this was his last hurrah following a stint with Hoot Gibson and Bob Steele as part of Monogram Pictures ' Trail Blazers series . By this time , Maynard's girth had gained quite a few inches , and he's quite paunchy , no longer the solid , youthful looking cowboy that he was at the start of his career in the mid 1920's . In the story , the three buddies hook up with a traveling medicine show to get the goods on an outlaw gang who robbed twenty five thousand dollars . In an interesting gimmick , the baddies sell a herd of five hundred cattle to a local rancher for precisely the same amount , and deposit the stolen marked money in a bank account , thereby throwing suspicion on a local rancher . The main villain , Jim Sorrell is played by veteran bad guy Charles King . Besides bringing in the hoodlums , the picture offers a side story with Eddie Dean romancing Ruth Roman's character , the daughter of the medicine show owner . Dean , one of the top cowboy crooners , sings the title song along with a couple of others , including an out of place but entertaining boogie woogie tune . What's interesting about the medicine show set up is that Max Terhune winds up delivering the sales pitch usually done by the snake oil salesman . I wondered about that for a while , especially since Pop Martin ( Robert McKenazie ) wound up with virtually nothing to do for his part in the story . If you're wondering about my summary quote above , I would be too , as it doesn't seem like a comment that would be coming out of a Western . Credit that to Terhune's ventriloquist dummy Elmer in response to learning that the local sheriff would be tracking the bad guys . I've seen Terhune's act with Elmer in a few of his Three Mesquiteers films , but here's a bit of trivia coming out of this flick . Care to guess Elmer's last name ? - it's Sneezeweed ! ! !
" Boys - it's the last of the West . "	If William S . Hart's birth date listed on the IMDb is accurate , and my math is correct , he would have been sixty one years old in the picture , which I find to be pretty amazing . Considering that his on screen sweetheart Miss Molly ( Barbara Bedford ) in the story is twenty two , I'd say that some of the early silents didn't let realism get in the way of a good story . Hart does show his age though in the opening minutes of the 1939 re-release version of the film where he opines about the death of the Wild West and his love of making movies . There are moments though where he goes for the melodrama and it comes across as almost comical yet sad at the same time . This is the only Hart film I've been able to get my hands on , and I'm glad to have been able to see the legendary cowboy in even this one effort . As far as stories go , it's all fairly standard and formulaic , but with some neat elements mixed in . For example , after viewing a few hundred Westerns over the years , not one in the bunch ever mentioned the positions of cowpokes in a cattle drive before . Here we're treated to a couple of neat title cards depicting a Pointer and a Wheeler , pretty cool I thought . As for action scenes , two instances involving Hart are worth mentioning as stand out . There's the pole vault he used to escape the ' Sooner ' stockade in the latter part of the film , along with that magnificent ride on horseback into the Cherokee Strip ; that race sequence looked phenomenal . Hart's sidekick in the film goes by Kentucky Rose ( Lucien Littlefield ) , with the gnarly bearded look that reminds one of those two ' Fuzzy's ' - Knight and St . John . He gets entangled in a somewhat unbelievable relationship with the pioneering Widow Riley ( Lillian Leighton ) , and it looks like he won't be a ' tumbleweed ' by the end of the story . Most of Kentucky's comedy relief comes by way of facial expressions ; for his part , it's a hoot to see how Hart deals with a frustrating cowlick . " Tumbleweeds " winds up symbolizing a way of life that was already disappearing by the time of the late 1800's , a life characterized by a constant roaming and search for meaning . Hart and Kentucky epitomize the ' tumbleweeds ' of the story , finding themselves out of place and out of synch with a country that wants to settle down , with Hart's character best expressing the sentiment evoked by the film's story - " The only land I'll settle down on will be under a tombstone " .
" There you are old boy , you respond properly and my theory is sound , you'll be more famous dead than alive . . . , throw the switch ! "	" Indestructible Man " is one of those 1950's pseudo horror gems that threaten to implode into comedy at any minute , but chalk one up for Lon Chaney Jr . here , he holds this thinly scripted melodrama together long enough to provide some entertaining moments . Chaney's character is Butcher Benton , about to die in the electric chair for his role in a six hundred thousand dollar robbery . Masterminding the heist , as well as taking the fall is Paul Lowe ( Ross Elliott ) , Benton's attorney . Vowing revenge from beyond ( like he knew he was coming back ) , Benton declares " Remember what I said , I'm gonna getcha , all three of ya " , including partners Squeamy Ellis ( Marvin Ellis ) and Joe Marcelli ( Ken Terrell ) . First major suspension of belief - how does a lab professor's assistant score a celebrity corpse , even if he WAS a criminal ? You'll recognize future Captain Binghamton from " McHale's Navy " as that assistant , and boy does he play it without emotion . When Professor Bradshaw ( Robert Shayne ) brings Benton back to life with an untested combination of a special blood transfusion with a kick of two hundred seventy thousand electrical volts , the most Flynn's character can muster is " How do you explain this ? " When Benton revives , he's left without his vocal chords , they were burned out in the electrical shock . The good news however is that his cellular structure was changed to acquire super human strength . The indestructible man can now withstand gun shots at close range without harmful effect , and as an added bonus , so can his clothes . They hold up well ( his clothes ) after repeated police encounters , including a bazooka round , and a blast from a flamethrower . The film tries to get some mileage from repeated close up shots of Lon Chaney's eyes , similar to footage of Bela Lugosi's signature eye stare in films like " Dracula " and " White Zombie " . It doesn't work as well for Chaney , the menace that Bela achieved with his glare is far superior . Maybe Chaney had too much on his mind , like what did I sign up for here ? Balancing out the cast and the story are Max Showalter as Police Lieutenant Dick Chasen and Marian Carr as showgirl Eva Martin . Eva had a somewhat platonic relationship with the Butcher , a shoulder for him to cry on when the Butcher's girl left him high a dry . Maybe I'm reading too much into it , but it seems a more than generous smile came across Eva's face when she learned the lieutenant's first name . Ultimately , Benton exacts his revenge upon attorney Lowe and the rest of his no-goodnik partners , just as he vowed earlier from a prison cell . Alas though , he meets his end atop a gigantic crane high above a power plant . The scene is reminiscent of James Cagney's farewell in " White Heat " , but without the defiant " Top of the World , Ma " . As Butcher Benton succumbs to a massive high voltage charge , I couldn't help thinking that here in fact was the basis for the film's real title - " Almost Indestructible Man " .
" Sometimes most essential clue very difficult to find . "	Opposing forces are at work in a dual plot that makes " Docks of New Orleans " an interesting Charlie Chan mystery . An international gang attempts to steal a secret gas formula that they can no longer prevent from being shipped to rival forces in South America . At the same time , the inventor of the gas formula seeks revenge on the owner and partners of the LaFontanne Chemical Company who paid him a measly sum for the formula , while cutting him out of huge profits and a partnership for himself . As usual , Charlie Chan casts a wary eye in all directions and pursues his investigation with excruciating patience . Roland Winters portrays Chan for the second time in this Monogram release . As before in " The Chinese Ring " , Victor Sen Yung appears with a confused identity - early in the film , Pop Chan refers to him as Number # 2 son , and somewhat later calls him by the name of Jimmy . Near the end of the movie , Chan calls out to Tommy . For those not as familiar with the Chan characters , Tommy as Number # 3 Son was portrayed in earlier Monogram's by Benson Fong . Was this a confusing lapse in continuity , or was Monogram by this time goofing on it's audience ? Mantan Moreland is back again as Chan servant Birmingham Brown . In an interesting twist , son Jimmy / Tommy retrieves a hijacked vehicle from a parking garage with Moreland's character along for the ride as a passenger ; Birmingham is the Chan chauffeur in earlier films . Birmingham also reprises a humorous exchange with an uncredited Haywood Jones as " Mobile " Jones , reminiscent of his " Pidgin ' English " dialog with Ben Carter in " The Scarlet Clue " and " Dark Alibi " . The key to solving the mystery is provided by Tommy and Birmingham in concert ( no pun intended ) when they offer a rendition of " Chop Suey Boogie " with Birmingham on piano and Tommy on violin . The high pitched screech of Tommy's violin causes a radio tube to break , leading Charlie to theorize that the deadly gas formula is released in the same manner . To eliminate the three partners who bilked him out of a fortune , inventor Swenstrom cleverly uses his wife's radio broadcasts to break tubes planted in the victims ' home and office radios , set to the precise station at the appropriate times . Granted , " Docks of New Orleans " is not high drama , and there are slow moments . Captain McNalley ( John Gallaudet ) of the New Orleans Police Department is particularly inept in dismissing clues and evidence that Chan immediately considers important . All considered though , this is an entertaining mystery and a nifty entry in the Chan series .
" So my gringo friends , tomorrow your necks will be considerably longer . "	As Americans move westward to California in the mid 1800's , the days of the old Spanish Dons and their vast ranchos are numbered . One such landowner is Don Jose Vargas , who bemoans the loss of his way of life . Roy Rogers is like a second son to Don Jose , but his integrity is threatened when he defends a band of white settlers who are accused of stealing gold earned in the sale of Vargas ' cattle by his foreman Sujarto ( Jack LaRue ) . Gabby Hayes is the leader of the settlers , traveling with his niece Jean ( Lynne Roberts as Mary Hart ) . When Roy and Gabby team up to discover the bandits ' hideout , they recover the gold only long enough to be framed for the robbery . Brought to Don Jose's estate , they are imprisoned in the Don's cellar , and under grim circumstances , Roy gets Gabby to join him in a duet of " We're Not Coming Out to the Dance Tonight " . Things go from bad to worse when the Don's daughter Rita ( Katherine DeMille ) insists that her father heed a plea from Gabby's niece to hear Roy's side of the story . As the Don is about to free Roy and Gabby , he's murdered by Sujarto , who frames Roy for the killing . Ultimately though , the good guys escape , with Roy literally chasing Sujarto down into the Pacific Ocean . In the closing scene , Roy has joined the settlers , and is presumably ready to settle down with the pretty Jean . Gabby's trusted mutt , sporting whiskers resembling Gabby's own , acknowledges his approval by hiding under the covered wagon .
" Don't push me Willy , I'm a grease monkey that won't slide so easily . "	Comparisons to the 1937 version of " Kid Galahad " are pointless , the only similarity between the two films is the nickname of the title character . It probably suits Elvis Presley a bit better than Wayne Morris , the knight in shining armor who at the film's opening touts his reputation in song as ' King of the Whole Wide World ' . The movie's trailer calls it a ' honey of a picture ' , and for his fans back in the day , maybe so . Events in the story conspire to turn Presley's character Walter Gulick from an ex-GI mechanic into a successful local boxer , thereby earning him a paycheck and the heart of Rose Grogan ( Joan Blackman ) , kid sis of Willy ( Gig Young ) . Together they own the Grogan Gaelic Gardens , an upstate New York resort that can't turn a profit because Willy Grogan is a gambling lush in hock to local hoods . You'd be hard pressed to call this a boxing movie though , Elvis takes turns as a punching bag in virtually every ring scene until he finds the magnetic wonder punch to knock his opponent out . The dramatic set up for Cream Valley's Labor Day extravaganza includes Grogan's encounter with the bad boys who hope to make a killing with bets on the fight . Kid Galahad comes through , but you knew that , this is the King's movie . There are some interesting casting surprises here , highlighted by Charles Bronson's turn as Galahad's trainer , and a very early film appearance by the uncredited Ed Asner . Gig Young is generally competent as Grogan , while female leads Lola Albright and Joan Blackman don't have a lot to do except play off their respective boyfriends . Albright's Dolly Fletcher gets to fire off an effective one liner defending Elvis ' character when she starts to lose patience for Grogan's marriage delays . Every now and then you'll catch an art deco tease with vivid reds , yellow and blues interspersed with Presley's songs . All are fairly mellow tunes ; the " I Got Lucky " number brought a chuckle as I imagined it being performed in a corn field instead of by the side of a lake . You know , the slow twist accompaniment seemed a bit , well , corny . Hey , it's not a bad little flick and a better way to remember Elvis by than the bloated self destructive image he came to bear in the years before his death . A bit of escapist entertainment that in it's way echoes Dolly Fletcher's sentiment early in the film - " Thanks Galahad " .
" I got plans and I got organization , nothing's gonna stop me . . . "	" Racket Busters " is a Warner Brothers period piece that zeroes in on racketeering in the food and trucking business of the 1930's . John " Czar " Martin ( Humphrey Bogart ) has his sights set on the entire industry , seeking tribute from everyone in the food chain through intimidation and bribery . Denny Jordan ( George Brent ) is the wavering hero , who at first stands up to the mob , but falls victim to their tactics after stealing a mob satchel to provide for his ailing wife . Martin is willing to overlook Jordan's indiscretion , provided he cooperates with Martin's plans to take over the trucker's association . A few of the truckers stand true to their ideals throughout the film - " Pop " ( Oscar O'Shea ) , the father figure of the working stiffs ; and Skeets Wilson ( Allen Jenkins ) , a friend of Jordan's who manages to see through the corruption even after his friend falls under Martin's influence . Future " Blondie " star Penny Singleton is on hand as Skeets ' fiancée , providing a moral anchor for her man . The film is fairly formulaic , with the bad guys holding the upper hand for most of the film , but after " Pop " is murdered , and Skeets takes the lead in riling the truckers to action , Jordan wakes up to the reality of the situation and takes up the cause once again . In a climactic scene , Jordan and Martin duke it out , as special prosecutor Hugh Allison ( Walter Abel ) finally collects enough damaging evidence to put Martin away for years to come . Humphrey Bogart is top billed , but it's George Brent who has more screen time and is the film's center of interest . Allen Jenkins does a credible job , keeping the faith even as his tomato commission business takes it on the chin . " Racket Busters " is not as hard edged as the title might make it seem , but it deserves at least a single viewing . For another Bogey film with a trucking theme , try 1940's " They Drive by Night " , co-starring George Raft .
" You do not distrust men who volunteer for certain death Mr . Kroll . "	The film gets credit for it's slow and deliberate pacing in the early going , as it builds suspense toward the revelation of the plot to destroy the Panama Canal . You had to wonder what all the intrigue and mystery was about regarding Clegg ( Paul Brinegar ) , Kroll ( John Mylong ) , Sam Wilton ( Leif Erickson ) and the film's title character Captain Trednor / Scarface ( Barton MacLane ) . It's not often you catch MacLane at the top of the credits , though he might have been upstaged in this one by Erickson as the hero of the piece . Still , he does a pretty good job when he's on screen , even if that German accent was somewhat distracting . The movie also did a nice job of explaining two key elements that might not have been offered in another film of the era where these kind of details weren't as important . For one , I was thinking about how the original Banos could have been blown up and disappeared without the authorities knowing , and that was handled competently by the Captain's explanation of Clegg's role to Wilton . Speaking of which , having Wilton's character portrayed as a former plantation foreman allowed for his proficiency with a machete . Too bad though about Mrs . Dilts , she seemed like a nice lady . That's not to say the picture didn't have it's share of outlandish elements . An atomic bomb on board a banana freighter ? - I don't think so . And how did Scarface manage to secure all the right scientific looking equipment on board the fake Banos without some knowledge of atomic bomb technology ? No need to get into that . Say , keep an eye on the handful of scenes starting with Wilton taking out the Captain up to breaking into the radio room with Crofton ; the sweat stains on his shirt and the bruise on his face change size and shape a number of times . Makes one wonder why those scenes weren't filmed one right after another . On balance though , I have no problem recommending this film for devotees of mystery and espionage , especially as a throwback to a time when Communist ideology threatened the very existence of the Western world - remember all those duck and cover drills in elementary school ? Ah yes , the 1950's , you had to be there .
" Let's take ' em to Mexico ! "	The opening Civil War battle scene in " The Undefeated " takes place three days after General Lee surrendered at Appomattox Court House , the opposing Colonels receiving word of the news via a courier on the battlefield . Union Colonel John Henry Thomas ( John Wayne ) is only too glad to get on with civilian life . He takes the remains of his once seventy five member regiment , now reduced to ten , on a drive to deliver wild horses to Mexico's Emperor Maximillian . His opponent , Confederate Colonel James Langdon ( Rock Hudson ) , disaffected with the War , intends to lead his men and their families to a new life via Durango and on to Mexico City . Along the way , the two Colonels renew acquaintances , in a virtual bygones be bygones ritual cemented by trading barbs and slugs of whiskey . But it won't be long before trouble begins , as Mexican banditos lay in ambush for the Confederate wagon train , seeking horses , gold and women , not necessarily in that order . Colonel Thomas had the foresight to send his adopted Cherokee son Blue Boy ( L . A . Rams Quarterback Roman Gabriel ) away from the Confederate party , to round up his redskin brothers to help save the day . From there on , the story meanders it's way along with some side stories involving a talented supporting cast that includes Bruce Cabot , Jan-Michael Vincent , Ben Johnson , and another football notable , Merlin Olsen . However you can't convince me that the women on the Confederate wagon train exhibit any degree of authenticity , as Lee Meriwether , Melissa Newman and Marian McCargo are all just too darn pretty , not a hair out of place and dressed to the nines in every scene , even when they pick up rifles to fight the bandits . Having just watched John Wayne in the 1948 film " Fort Apache " , I was conscious of a possible reference to the Shirley Temple character in that film when Colonel Thomas and Colonel Langdon have a conversation . Thomas responds to his Southern counterpart " Not like Philadelphia " , which was the name of Temple's character . When Langdon seeks clarification , Thomas says never mind . Any insight into that exchange would be appreciated . Following the film's progress for two hours , the ending comes as a bit of a letdown , as one expects the alliance between the Union and Confederate Colonels to lead a final charge against the Juarista General Rojas ( Antonio Aguilar ) , who holds the members of Langdon's wagon train hostage in exchange for Colonel Thomas ' horses . Instead , Thomas agrees to the terms , presumably to insure a fight for another day and another movie .
" Softly , softly , catchee monkey " .	It's interesting that this movie had a Scotland Yard connection , one might have expected Sherlock Holmes to make an appearance . Mr . Moto ( Peter Lorre ) assumes the identity of a Japanese houseboy to Parisian criminal Paul Brissac following their escape from a Devil's Island prison camp . Once situated in London , Moto begins his investigation into an international ' League of Assassins ' , who have targeted industrialist Anton Darvak ( Henry Wilcoxon ) for his newly developed steel formula . Moto manages to dodge Scotland Yard detectives as well as nasty League henchmen in order to uncover the head of the assassins . In one of those films where the least likely character turns out to be the criminal mastermind , you have to wonder why Frensham ( Erik Rhodes ) allowed himself to be positioned under the murder weapon , hostage to Moto in one of his many disguises . Say , didn't he remind you of Arte Johnson's dirty old man character from ' Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In " ? Now just over half way through watching the Mr . Moto films , I'm impressed as to how consistently better they seem to be compared against those of the other Oriental detective of the era , Charlie Chan . The Chan stories relied on repeated use of the old lights out trick and other ruses on the way to solving the mystery , whereas the Moto stories are a lot more physical , even violent , with Moto engaging in a fair share of the action . In this one , Moto delivers some crisp judo throws and takes some wild flying leaps tackling bad guy Brissac in the finale . Elsewhere on this board I learned that Lorre's stuntman for the martial arts sequences was a gentleman named Harvey Parry . Even though they're nearly seventy years old , it's still a kick to watch any of these old time detective mystery films . Peter Lorre is a blast as Mr . Moto , and any movie in the series from Twentieth Century Fox is recommended for fans of the genre .
" It's my job to bring escaped Nazis to justice . "	It struck me while watching " The Stranger " that this could have been an Alfred Hitchcock film , what with the clock tower motif and the stairs / ladder plot element , not to mention the Nazi connection with Hitch's " Notorious " . Considering all that , there are a number of counterbalancing effects that prevent the film from being as great as it could have been . Orson Welles is believable up to a point as escaped Nazi war criminal Franz Kindler , masquerading as college professor Charles Rankin in a small Connecticut town . Yet his performance is uneven , with the cold calculating former Nazi virtually falling apart as he brings his new wife Mary ( Loretta Young ) up to speed regarding his criminal past . It's difficult to believe that the mastermind of the Nazi death camps would have so easily given himself away to face capture and punishment , let alone hang around for War Crime Commission czar Wilson ( Edward G . Robinson ) to put him away . At least Rankin had the good sense to avoid being seen after crawling around in the dirt following his dispatch of Meinike ( Konstantin Shayne ) . But really , his absence from the entire wedding reception was never adequately dealt with , and Mary's reaction never got hostile the way a real newlywed would have . That was a neat touch with the preoccupied Rankin scribbling away at a Nazi swastika while setting up his wife for a quick exit . If you suspend critical judgment while watching , " The Stranger " winds up as a fair enough thriller , owing primarily to Robinson's character methodically working the town's citizens to help expose his victim . However it was with an unintended chuckle that I came away from the story , considering the way Rankin deliberately murdered his former associate ; here in fact was the basis for the original Meinike muffler .
" Well here's another nice bucket of suds you've gotten me into ! "	With Oliver Hardy bedeviled by the sound of horns , bells , phones and trombones , his doctor Finlayson advises peace and quiet and a diet of goat milk . Partner Stan Laurel comes up with a great solution , living on a docked boat so the salt sea air can help Ollie get all the rest he needs . It's a great premise for all the mad cap hijinks to ensue , as the boat is set adrift by the hungry goat , and an escaped convict ( Richard Cramer ) stows along for the ride . I got a kick out of all the gags in the film , starting with that sign in the horn testing factory - ' Silence While Men Are Working ' . The early story at the boys ' apartment features a number of mixed up plumbing and appliance mishaps , with Stan doing a banana within a banana bit . Laurel has a couple of great lines in the picture , like " We must have been dis-unconnected " , but the one that had me rolling was his response to the criminal on board ship - " Self preservation is the last law of averages " - precisely ! I'm not as great a student of Laurel and Hardy's films as many on this board , all I know is I enjoyed them as a kid and find them to be as entertaining today as they were back in my youth . On that count , " Saps At Sea " provides a decent hour of hornophobic fun , well on it's way to hornomania .
" You see , I wanted to be a detective too . It only took brains , courage and a gun , and I had the gun . "	I never tire of Bob Hope's brand of humor , whether it be stand up or in films , and " My Favorite Brunette " is a great showcase for his comedic talent . I got a kick out of an early scene where he uses his famous beak to slide open the peephole of a door leading to death row . It's a self deprecating move and clearly shows that the man was big enough not to take himself too seriously . There's an element of understated glamor attached to the presence of Dorothy Lamour here . She looks elegant in whatever the wardrobe department throws at her . Didn't you just feel the heat when she croons to Hope's character - " Please baby , do it for mama " . Peter Lorre's always a favorite when it comes to the weaselly gunsel routine . Funny how you never hear the word ' gunsel ' anymore . Lon Chaney Jr . ' s on hand too as a henchman for Major Montague ( Charles Dingle ) , but it seems like he considers himself more of a friend to Hope's character than he is a bad guy . The cameos are great , but who else did a double take with Alan Ladd looking like a young Robert Mitchum ? I fully expected Bing to make an appearance , so no disappointment there - " Boy , he'll take any kind of part " . I'm not so sure that " My Favorite Brunette " is the best title they could have come up with for this picture , but you know what , it doesn't matter much . It's mile a minute quips and one liners from one of the masters , who looks like he's having just as much fun whether dishing it out or taking it .
" Well we can run , or we can stay and fight " .	" Gold of the Seven Saints " is such a cool sounding title for a Western that it's a shame the movie failed to live up to the mystery . I still can't get used to the idea of Roger Moore in a horse opera , and in this one he's not even asked to mask his English accent , instead going for a hearty Irish brogue . His character Shaun Garrett teams up with laconic TV Western star Clint Walker , an unlikely duo who discover gold and attempt to haul a hundred forty five pounds of it across the desert to the safety of the title town - that would be where the Seven Saints part of the story comes in . Midway , the pair hook up with Chill Wills in what might be the most serious role I've seen him in , that of a doctor who quite intentionally joins the boys hoping to offer his knowledge and services in exchange for a fair share of the bundle . I think it all sounds a lot better on paper than it does in the execution . Though there a couple of shoot-outs with Gene Evans ' gang of outlaws , I never got the impression that Rainbolt ( Walker ) and Garrett were ever in too much trouble , even when McCracken's ( Evans ) men kidnap Doc and Garrett in a ransom move . It made me wonder why they didn't go for Senorita Tita ( Leticia Roman ) , that might have been the more suspenseful alternative . Even Robert Middleton's hearty portrayal of Rainbolt's old Mexican friend seems a throwaway by the finale . His half hearted challenge to Rainbolt to split the gold is swept under the rug , or under the river as it were , in a move reminiscent of " Treasure of the Sierra Madre " . But this was no Sierra Madre , with a result that didn't convey the same power and irony as that earlier Bogart classic .
" John Wayne . . . , that's a terrible cowboy name ! "	As a fan of movie Westerns , I got the biggest kick every time a reference was made or an homage paid to characters and films that had gone before . Most obvious of course is the title knock off of genre favorite " High Noon " , and it just keeps building from there . Chon Wang / John Wayne was a hoot , along with the very obvious naming of the bad guy sheriff after high profile character actor Lee Van Cleef . Then there's the bit where Jackie Chan's horse does the gimmick with the blanket , something I'd seen done before by no less notable equine stars as Roy Rogers ' Trigger and Tonto's Scout in pictures going back to the early 1950's . Above all , I couldn't help noticing in scene after scene how much Owen Wilson looked like Redford's Sundance Kid , so much so that I could almost picture him as Paul Newman's sidekick in that 1969 film , except Wilson couldn't even come close as an actor . Which is OK if you're going for the over the top kind of comedy that this one does , but then you have to be prepared for mixed results . By that I'm thinking about scenes like the drunken hot tub splish splash that would have been alright if done just once , but got to be tedious after just the second time . There were just too many moments like that one that seemed to interfere with the flow of the story . Brandon Merrill had the thankless task of Chon Wang's Indian wife , who seemed to pop up from time to time to let us know she was around , but without any real connection to the story . So she came through with a save near the end of the picture , but why do the flip flop for Roy O'Bannon ( Wilson ) as Chon Wang pairs off with the Princess ( Lucy Liu ) ? Not very realistic or believable , especially on the part of the women . I would expect a Chinese princess to have more class than that , and an Indian maiden would certainly have had more discipline . But let's face it , you go into a Jackie Chan film for the martial arts choreography and innovative fight scenes , so on that score , this one delivers . Hard to imagine how you could incorporate trees and moose antlers into a fight routine , but Jackie does it with style . I'd like to know if you could expend all that energy beating up on six Crow warriors and still remain standing , but I think we all know that answer - it's a movie . Say , I noticed something that made me curious relative to a street sign in Carson City in the latter part of the picture . You could only make out a portion of the message that stated ' Bulldog Drummond's ? ' . So I did a quick google to learn that Bulldog Drummond's first literary appearance occurred in a 1920 novel . That would have been quite the feat to predict his existence approximately forty years into the future from the story's setting in 1881 . Somehow I don't think Chong Wang and O'Bannon needed the help of a fictional British detective .
" Well what are we dawdling for , don't spare the horses ! "	This was rather an anomaly among ' B ' Westerns , the nominal bad guy Stephen Bent ( Richard Dix ) conducted himself rather admirably , while the loyal foreman of the Jeptha Marr Freighting Company , Gideon Skene ( Albert Dekker ) , often looked like a vigilante . The REAL outlaw of course was Champ Clanton , portrayed by the ever capable Victor Jory in all his villainous glory . The story itself was played out rather seamlessly , no mean feat for an oater from the 1940's . So much so , that it's about the only one I've ever rated as high as a 7 , and that includes virtually all of the Roy Rogers and Gene Autry flicks . It didn't hurt that there was an intriguing supporting cast that included Lee J . Cobb and Jane Wyatt , which in an unusual casting decision , called for Miss Wyatt , a year older than Cobb , to play his daughter ! ! ! In fact , I'd have to say that Cobb's character here , Jeptha Marr , looked older than a handful of roles he performed up to as much as a decade later . For anyone who gets a kick out of those little nuances that shed light on life in an earlier era , this film offers a few that were pretty interesting . Like when Gideon offers a dollar per man to unload his wagons at Pawnee and there were no shortage of takers . Or how about that conversation between Jane Wyatt's character and Bent on how marvelous it was that trains traveled at the unprecedented speed of twenty five miles per hour ? ! ! Why someday , you would be able to take a train from New York City to San Francisco in less than two weeks ! Can you imagine that ? Of course , it's always cool to catch Joe Sawyer in one of his tough guy roles , but for a real life tough guy , Max Baer had to be one of the best as a former World's Heavyweight Champ . He's suitably cast here as one of Gideon's good guy sidekicks named ' Tiny ' , getting to show off some of his dexterity in the fisticuffs department . But the surprise of the picture for me - George Reeves popping up as a railroad surveyor ! You just have to love these old Westerns for the actors who turn up before they made it . The only thing I would question regarding the story would be how easily Jeptha Marr became a pro-railroad man at the finale . Not that it couldn't have happened with a little more plot development , but earlier he wanted railroad agent Bent off his land or under it ! It works well enough for the story , but just don't think about it too much .
" You an outlaw now , Pa ? "	With the Hallmark name attached I expected somewhat more from " Desolation Canyon " and was less than impressed and satisfied with this picture . The feature players were prominent enough to carry off their roles , but somehow Patrick Duffy didn't seem to pull it off as the grizzled sheriff of Green River . There was no hard edge to his demeanor , and even less urgency to taking up the chase after the Press Reynolds gang after they kidnap a young boy . Now I can bow to the wisdom of his older partner Sam ( Stacy Keach ) who seemed to know a whole lot more about the tracking business than sheriff Swede . As it turns out , the quarry includes Swede's own son turned outlaw , and the kidnapped boy is Sam's grandson Abe . The good guys are aided by an uprooted Boston banker ( David Rees Snell ) who knows something about handling firearms , and that's one of the twists of the story . In one of the better conceived scenes of the film , Edwin confronts bounty hunter Winters , leaving him both confounded and weaponless when he simply takes a six gun right out of his hand . On the flip side , that probably would never happen in a real life situation . Another scene defying credibility occurs when the good guy trio pauses on the trail at a saloon , soon followed by Press Reynolds ( Kenny Johnson ) and his main henchman Jack McAllister ( Courtney Gains ) . Press and his boys blew up the bank at Green River , stole seven hundred dollars , and conspired with Johnny Kendrick ( Victor Browne ) to kidnap Johnny's son . With all the build up aimed at convincing the viewer what a fearsome reputation Sam Kendrick had as a gunman , the movie could have been almost over right then and there . But nothing happened . At least some credit goes to the kidnapped boy Abe , wisely leaving a wooden toy horse on the trail as a clue to follow . Later when one of the wounded outlaws is left to oversee the boy , and just as I finished saying to myself the kid just ought to get up and go , the kid just gets up and goes ! However take away points for running into an open field where the gang picks him up again to resume the cat and mouse game . As other posters on the film have noted , clichés abound , mainly written for Patrick Duffy's character , but the one that came out wildly but unintentionally funny was uttered by hard boiled Sam at the final showdown - " Reynolds , you worthless piece of . . . . dung ! ! ! Obviously cleaned up for the Hallmark audience , the remark only drew more attention to itself as wholly unrealistic given the circumstances . It's soon overshadowed though when Reynolds sends Johnny out with a single bullet to kill his father . In probably the only moment they ever faced each other man to man , Johnny implores - " Make sure Abe don't turn out like you and me " - just before he's sent to Boot Hill by Reynolds . Except for the gorgeous scenery and superb cinematography , " Desolation Canyon " winds up merely adequate as a made for TV Western , while the relentless pace of the commercials in the final third of the story didn't help . Even the title hearkens back to the days of the ' B ' Western , when the name of the film had little or nothing to do with the story . There never was mention made of a canyon , desolate or otherwise , and the final showdown occurred at Antelope Springs .
" You'll be sleeping on the skin of a nightmare for the rest of your life " .	This was my first experience of a Sam Fuller picture , and I have to say , it was quite the revelation . The entire film keeps you slightly off balance , starting right out of the gate with that bizarre opening , which could have had any number of interpretations . It was interesting that the full details of that encounter weren't revealed until some time later in the story , by which time I had started to form a different idea of what had originally happened . But the scene that changed the entire picture for me had to be Kelly's ( Constance Towers ) discovery of Grant's ( Michael Dante ) pedophilia . Even though it was all done by inference and suggestion , I was immediately creeped out by the assault on innocence that changed the whole complexion of the story on a dime . Kelly's reaction was swift and deadly , and in keeping with the street smarts gained from a life of prostitution . I was surprised to see that this film was made as late as 1964 . It had a lot of the earmarks of the type of ' educational ' film that came out of the 1930's and ' 40's that have earned cult status for their camp portrayals . I'm thinking of titles like " Delinquent Daughters " and " Slaves in Bondage " , but here , the emphasis doesn't seem to be on creating sensationalism as much as forcing the viewer to think outside the box regarding aberrant behavior . Grant's conversation when he's outed as a pervert is particularly revealing ; he believes that he and Kelly could have a wonderful marriage because they're both abnormal . How's that for a rationale ? For it's unusual and offbeat subject matter , " The Naked Kiss " is a stunningly surprising movie , one that won't appeal to every taste , but it certainly leaves it's impact on the viewer in a way that precariously treads the line between entertainment and revulsion . Constance Towers is unusually effective in maintaining credibility for her character after the shock of that opening scene wears off . This is only the second time I've seen a bald woman in a picture , the first being Persis Khambatta in the 1979 flick - " Star Trek : The Motion Picture " . In both instances , there's something to say about how sexy a bald woman can be under the right circumstances . I think Captain Kirk would agree .
" I saw what I saw when I saw it ! "	" Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein " is probably my favorite film by Bud and Lou , teamed up as they are with Universal Studios ' all time horror trio - Frankenstein , Dracula and the Wolf Man . Part of the fun for me was seeing Bela Lugosi reprise his original 1931 role as Count Dracula , and Lon Chaney portraying his 1941 Wolf Man character . Maintaining continuity , Chaney's alter ego is Larry Talbot , the anguished soul cursed by the bite of a werewolf and doomed to become one whenever the moon comes out . Glenn Strange , a veteran of dozens of " B " Westerns primarily as a henchman , is cast as the Frankenstein Monster and does credibly well . In the scene when Lou's Chick Young character first encounters Dracula and the Monster , Strange does a great double take feigning horror at the sight of Chick . For some strange reason not explained in the film , Chick repeatedly refers to the Monster as " junior " . Rounding out the cast are Lenore Aubert as Dr . Sandra Mornay , assistant to the Count , Jane Randolph as insurance investigator Joan Raymond , and Charles Bradstreet as scientist Dr . Stevens , who helps the boys out when he realizes what the Count's plans really are . " Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein " is pure silliness and fun , and is recommended for fans of the comedy duo . It's probably the best of the films created around other horror characters where the boys meet up with The Mummy , The Invisible Man , and Dr . Jekyll and Mr . Hyde , all of which followed this 1948 title .
" Before anyone kills me they've got to get my OK . "	All the classic elements of a good spaghetti Western are on hand here , the rocky desert locales , the Mexican looking Italian villains , . . . and Lee Van Cleef . His character goes by the single name of Ryan , on the trail of a quartet of desperadoes who did him wrong during a murderous night at the Meceita homestead fifteen years earlier , where the story opens . Ryan saved a young boy's life then , but not his nightmares as the boy grew to manhood . Now , twenty one year old Billy has had years of practice with all manner of firearms , and waits for the day he can exact his vengeance on the marauders who killed his family . I got a chuckle out of the scene involving Ryan's release from prison while taking the rap for his gang's villainy . Apparently , the warden hadn't cleaned his desk for fifteen years ; Ryan's twenty seven bullets were still in the bottom drawer ! John Phillip Law portrays the vengeful Billy , impersonating a ruggedly handsome Clint Eastwood . Director Giulio Petroni sees fit to capitalize on Law's looks , zooming in for numerous facial close ups . His gun work is impressive as well , and though I haven't seen any of his other work , I'd say he passes reasonably well in this film . Playing the brash and impulsive revenge seeker , you know he's got a lot to learn from the older , wiser and more methodical Ryan . If not , then two stolen horses and a burial up to his neck should be enough to make him a bit more humble . The relationship between Ryan and Billy see saws throughout the film , all the while waiting for Billy's recognition of the first time he saw Ryan . What happens can go either way , for that you'll have to see the film . The Italian movie title's literal translation has nothing to do with horses , and " Death Rides a Horse " is too truncated to sound as cool as the ones in Eastwood's trilogy . Maybe " Death Rides a Dark Horse " , or " Death Rides a Pale Horse " ; either one would have worked , as the film's protagonists rode on one of each .
" I'm honest because with you , I think , it's the best way to get results . "	Just about everything works with " Suspicion " , except of course the ending , not so much that it negates everything we've come to know about Johnnie Aysgarth ( Cary Grant ) , but in the way in which Lina ( Joan Fontaine ) simply takes it on faith that what Johnnie reveals is true . Johnnie the schemer , Johnnie the conniver , Johnnie the rogue ; ' yes dear , I was going to kill myself because I can't pay back my debts ' . Then they proceed to drive home to live happily ever after , except of course , nothing's changed . Johnnie still owes on his gambling debts and the embezzlement at Melbeck's , so how exactly is everything now hunky dory ? The explanation of course lies in the fact that Hitchcock's studio restrictions wouldn't allow him to portray Cary Grant as a murderer . It's too bad since having Grant play some of his scenes with an uncharacteristically dark edge revealed a side to his acting that wasn't often seen up till then . Contrast that with the sublime beauty of his new wife Lina ( Joan Fontaine ) , and you had the makings of a real thriller , but the ' huh ? ' ending we actually get made it less than satisfying for this viewer . Especially after ' murder ' in the scrabble tiles , ' Murder on the Footbridge ' and murder in the milk glass . Up until the ending though , I found the principals quite credible . Grant and Fontaine take their portrayals through convincing character arcs that build suspense along the way . I particularly enjoyed Nigel Bruce as Beaky ; as Dr . Watson in the Sherlock Holmes franchise he's much too restrained . Here he's affably jovial and offhandedly self effacing , as in the scene where he makes himself stand in the corner ; that almost took on the appearance of an ad lib and it worked wonderfully . Over the past year I've seen a number of Hitchcock's early British films , and one can note the progress in his story telling style . Now with back to back viewings of " Strangers On A Train " and " Suspicion " , it's apparent that not all of his American movies were an unqualified success . In a way that's O . K . , since it prepared him for his later masterpieces , notably " North by Northwest " and " Psycho " .
" Gee , you know , it's stupefying . "	Another entry in the late 1930's Mr . Moto series from Twentieth Century Fox , this one finds the Japanese sleuth in an adventure on the island of Puerto Rico . As in the first film , " Think Fast , Mr . Moto " , the plot involves a diamond smuggling operation , and it too involves transport of the gems via cruise ships , however most of Mr . Moto's ( Peter Lorre ) investigation takes place on dry land . One of the things I liked about the early Charlie Chan movies from Fox were the references often made to events in a prior picture . In this story , Moto allows himself to be mistaken for a Japanese outlaw named Shimura . When Commissioner Gordon ( Richard Lane ) converses with a government official in the U . S . , he learns that Moto will use any ruse as part of his investigation , learning of the escape from a Devil's Island prison camp in the prior movie , " Mysterious Mr . Moto " . It's those little insertions that make the Oriental Detective movies so much fun for me . As in all the Moto films , this one features the sleuth in various martial arts scenes , but with a noticeable difference . In all the prior stories , the fights were almost always staged in very dim , even dark locations . The ones on display here are done in broad daylight , but even so , it's impossible to detect the stunt man ( Harvey Parry ) responsible for the flips and throws . Speaking of which , even Douglas Dumbrille's character La Costa manages to get a round house kick in on Moto's sidekick in the film , wrestler Twister McGurk ( Warren Hymer ) . Twister becomes Moto's shadow for virtually the entire picture , thanks in part to Moto's distraction of opponent Sailor Sam in the film's opening sequence . Anyone else do a double take to see Ward Bond in that role ? Keep an eye on the scenes involving Moto's second trip into the swamp in the latter half of the film . The lower half of Mr . Moto's pants are alternately muddy and clean in scenes that take place at the villains ' camp . Some viewers may find the later pictures in the Moto series to be inferior to the early ones , but I have to say that this one was as entertaining to me as the ones that went before . By now one has a pretty good sense of how Moto operates , solving the crime via a series of masquerades , martial arts and clever analysis . The addition of some comic relief to this film by way of Twister's malapropisms was just the right touch to keep things moving along briskly .
" I smell the faint sweet odor of blackmail . "	Sherlock Holmes ( Basil Rathbone ) and his assistant Dr . Watson ( Nigel Bruce ) are called in by Scotland Yard to help solve the most atrocious series of murders since Jack the Ripper . The victims are all women who are fiendishly mutilated , their forefingers severed and apparently taken by the perpetrator . Holmes comes to believe that the murders are incidental to a more sinister scheme , and what he discovers is a plot involving hypnotism and blackmail ; behind it all is his chief nemesis , the diabolical Professor Moriarty ( Henry Daniell ) . For his part , Moriarty engages the beautiful Hillary Brooke as his " Woman in Green " , though that's a moot point since the black and white film never references her choice of attire . Brooke is eerily malevolent as Lydia Marlowe , seducing unsuspecting victims to her apartment , then hypnotizing them into committing murder and blackmailing them for her silence . As effective as her performance was , it was difficult separating Brooke from her lighter role as Lou Costello's neighbor and would be girl friend on the " Abbott and Costello " show . Here she can make ice cubes with just one look . Viewing Holmes and his arch enemy Moriarty spar verbally is always a treat , as they discuss their plans for each other . You don't doubt it when Holmes proclaims " We shall walk through the gates of eternity hand in hand " . Nigel Bruce's Watson offers up two great comedic scenes . The first is a quick visual , as Watson answers a phone call for help he's shown blowing the dust off his medical bag . Later , as he casually dismisses the effectiveness of hypnotism , he's caught with his pants down , well make that just one leg , as he's made the butt of a parlor gag in front of an audience . In what could have been a cliffhanger ending , Holmes puts himself in harm's way , as the seductive Miss Marlowe hypnotizes him and Moriarty then takes over , eliciting a suicide note from the detective for failure to solve the murders . As he precariously balances on the ledge of a rooftop , Holmes ' trust in his aide de camp is put to the test . With Watson's arrival , along with Inspector Gregson of The Yard ( Matthew Boulton ) , the jig is up for Moriarty , whose escape attempt ends in his fall from a ledge and his own demise . Or does it ? It looked like curtains for Lionel Atwill's Moriarty in " Sherlock Holmes and The Secret Weapon " under similar circumstances . Sherlock Holmes fans should find this entry entertaining enough . This is only the sixth film I've seen in the series , and it appears to be one of the better ones . I'm finally getting better at keeping up with the dialog , as some of the films have a tinny sound quality that make understanding hard to follow . For novices interested in getting on board with the Holmes films , there's a neat ten movie package on five DVD's from Brentwood Home Video . As a plus , there's five bonus TV episodes from the series that starred Ronald Howard in the Holmes role .
" You don't just go and rob a train , it takes practice . "	This film has taken a lot of heat for it's role as a prequel to the Paul Newman / Robert Redford classic , but I think if you give it a chance it stands on it's own legs fairly well . The uncanny part of the picture is the remarkable resemblance ( most of the time ) that Tom Berenger and William Katt have to the stars of the 1969 original . While some of the banter between the two might seem awkward at times , it has the feel of two future buddies getting to know and trust each other and therefore appears more realistic than forced . The nods to the original are apparent without being over done , and it's cool to see Jeff Corey reprise his role as Sheriff Ray Bledsoe , even if he looks older here . Future relationships with characters Harvey Logan and Joe Le Fors are also introduced , creating just enough interest for fans of " Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid " to keep tuned in to see what happens next . My viewing of the film last night was the first , having over the years shied away from it because of my fondness for the original , but you know what - it was entertaining and one could definitely do worse . I'd recommend a look , even if it's only effect is to make you appreciate the original even more .
" Well , here's to what was " .	Twenty four hours since I've watched the movie , and with time to reflect , I would have given it higher marks yesterday . I guess that comes from thinking about the high degree of coincidence necessary to pull off the story , like Joyce Harwood ( Veronica Lake ) finding hitchhiker Johnny Morrison ( Alan Ladd ) in the rain , or Helen Morrison ( Doris Dowling ) picking up Buzz ( William Bendix ) in a bar after being ditched by her husband . Not to mention the set up with Johnny's service revolver that was a prerequisite for the murder to take place . Films of the Forties and Fifties relied on such techniques to a fault , and is one of the main reasons that a lot of them don't work for me when put under the microscope . But with that out of the way , I'd still recommend " The Blue Dahlia " for it's noir atmosphere and flawed characters , and a credible cast that does what they can with the material . Among that cast , it's probably William Bendix that will hold your attention the most as the shell shocked returning war vet who rather brazenly makes sure you get a look at the metal plate in his head . My earliest recollection of Bendix was his starring role in ' The Life of Riley ' TV series of the mid Fifties , and for the longest time I had him pegged as a comic actor . Here however he gives a fine representation of his much greater range and it's no surprise that he received top billing right along with Ladd and Lake . It was his character in fact that was originally written as the murderer , coming unglued by the repetitious plucking of the dahlia by Helen , and put over the edge by the pounding ' monkey music ' from next door . The movie actually brings you to that conclusion except for the Charlie Chan like explanation from the police captain that fingers the house dick for the finale . That revelation comes practically out of nowhere , and with it , a minor let down from the suspense that had been built up to that point . This was my first look at Veronica Lake , and I can't say I was overly impressed by her presence . She has the reputation of one of the leading film sirens of her day , but there seemed to be something missing here . The chemistry with Ladd seemed so-so , and for his part , there was a certain laid back quality that I found frustrating . Maybe I've seen too many Bogart and Cagney pictures , I was looking for a little more intensity in Ladd's character . Catching the film last night on Turner Classics , host Robert Osborne mentioned that this was the only script Raymond Chandler wrote specifically to be made into a movie . Paramount was so psyched to do the picture that filming started before Chandler finished the story , and then he developed a mental block . Having already sworn off booze , Chandler had to start drinking again to get the creative juices flowing to finish the script . He had to change his ending though , when the studio got pressure from the military over portraying a returning veteran in an unfavorable light , much less a murderer . That's something else I began thinking about , how times have changed in the sixty plus years since this picture was made . Today , it's almost a certainty that the returning serviceman would be the killer .
" If walls could talk , they might tell a different story " .	I have to say I'll always enjoy a Charles Laughton movie , but you have to admit , pictures from the early days of film almost always laid it right out there for the viewer as if one couldn't put two and two together . In this case , the murder of young Medland ( Ray Milland ) - it's OK for the viewer to be in on the little secret , but gee , could it have been any more obvious to anyone in the Marble home to figure out what happened ? A newly dug up back yard wouldn't have raised too much suspicion now would it ? Or how about that great big old bottle of cyanide sitting on the book shelf in plain view , with books discussing the subject of poisoning by cyanide the only reading material in the house ? You had to know that William Marble ( Laughton ) wasn't going to get away with this one , so the intrigue was in how the story would get you there . I think with a little more creativity , old Marble could probably have gone for a two-fer with Mrs . Collins ( Verree Teasdale ) if you know what I mean . Instead , poor Mrs . Marble ( Dorothy Peterson ) had to agonize her way through thoughts of extortion , adultery and suicide if her husband ever proved to be unfaithful . I was sad to see her go . Probably more unbelievable to me than the whole idea of murdering his own nephew was Marble's ability to turn the boy's wallet into a fortune of thirty thousand pounds - now there was the real mystery . In every other aspect of his life , Laughton's character seemed to be a real loser , pushing his wife around and completely unbearable to his daughter Winnie ( Maureen O'Sullivan ) . Who would have guessed that the line of BS he gave to Medland might have made them both rich . Check this one out if you can get your hands on it ; I happened to catch it on Turner Classics last night and it made for an entertaining hour and a half . There's always a good chance you'll pick up some neat trivia from one of the film hosts on Turner ; like the studio being pressured to remove direct references to cyanide in case it might give ideas to potential husband / killers in the future . They certainly didn't foresee the advent of the internet a mere seventy years later , where you could learn everything you ever wanted to know to commit murder and mayhem of your very own .
" Everybody's got a star to follow . "	Consistently shown these days on AMC , I managed to catch " Man Without A Star " this morning . Without knowing anything about the story , one might think it had something to do about a lawman without a badge , but here the title is used figuratively , and makes sense when cowpoke Dempsey Rae ( Kirk Douglas ) teaches his sidekick , Texas Jeff ( William Campbell ) , on finding his way by following an evening star . In that regard , the ' man without a star ' in the story would have been the direction-less Jeff Jimson , as Dempsey Rae always knew where he was going , even if conflicted about it . Douglas seems to be having a genuinely good time here , strutting his stuff on banjo much like he did in his film from a year earlier , " 20 , 000 Leagues Under The Sea " . Seeing it on TV , I didn't have the opportunity to pause and rewind , but it looked like Douglas finished playing his first song about a half click before the music stopped . I can still give him credit for his singing voice though . The story itself is a fairly typical open range tale that turns deadly once barb wire enters the picture - " When wire comes in , there's fightin ' and killin ' . " A little more thought could have gone into developing Dempsey's stand on the issue ; at first we're convinced he's dead against it , then he's putting up a fence in defiance of former boss Reed Bowman ( Jeanne Crain ) . By the end of the story , he's heading into a further fence-less West , leaving behind Bowman , Texas Kid , and Madame Idonee ( Claire Trevor ) . In hindsight , I would like to have seen more of Trevor in the story , maybe brawling it out with Bowman the way Dempsey and hell raiser Steve Miles ( Richard Boone ) did , wouldn't that have been something ? I liked director King Vidor's subtle humorous bits in the story , notably the running gag about a bathroom ' in the house ' , and Kirk Douglas combing his hair with the help of a goldfish bowl . And say , have you ever seen Kirk Douglas ' dimple more pronounced than it is here ?
" If you did do it , I'm all for you . That woman had at least one murder coming to her . "	" Charlie Chan in Reno " offers a cleverly woven mystery in which the murder suspects are all revealed to have had some involvement with each other in the past . It helps when watching to keep a scorecard to keep track of events and relationships so the final revelation makes sense . Not only do we have a murder victim , but an attempted murder as well . When Mary Whitman ( Pauline Moore ) is found over the dead body of Jeanne Bentley ( Louise Henry ) , she of course is the obvious suspect , and with a firm motive ; Bentley was going to marry Whitman's about to be ex-husband . But Bentley had a unique way of alienating most everyone with her ingratiating manner , not the least of which was another suitor , Wally Burke ( Robert Lowery ) . Burke comes across as suitably suspicious , as does Dr . Ainsley ( Ricardo Cortez ) , who is surprised to be discovered in the murder room of the Hotel Sierra , claiming to be looking for the money won by Bentley at the casino , offering robbery as the motive for the crime . Charlie Chan ( Sidney Toler in his second performance as the Oriental Detective ) is aided in the case by Number # 2 Son Jimmy ( Victor Sen Yung , credited as Sen Yung ) . Jimmy is on spring break from the University of Southern California , and gets himself mugged by a pair of con men who steal his borrowed car ; he's identified by " Pop " in a police line up . There's also Police Chief King ( played straight by Charles D . Brown ) and an inept Reno Sheriff Tombstone Fletcher ( Slim Summerville ) . Fletcher is quick to dismiss Chan's serious questioning and investigative work , preferring to pin the crime on the innocent Mary Whitman . Once Charlie gets down to business , a whole host of new clues and information come to light . The investigation eventually leads to an abandoned ghost town outside of Reno , and yet another suspect , this time Jeanne Bentley's ex husband George . For trivia fans , there are two actors in " Reno " that also appeared in Toler's first Chan adventure in " Honolulu " . Phyllis Brooks as Vivian Wells is ultimately revealed to be the murderer ; while Eddie Collins does a comic turn as the talkative cab driver . Collins was the lion keeper aboard a freighter in the " Honolulu " film . Before the mystery is over , Chan unravels an entire network of entanglements that connect the murder victim with each of the suspects , and the suspects with one another . It's rather cleverly done , and promotes this film to one of the better Charlie Chan titles , particularly those of Sidney Toler .
" You're right , you're always right . . . that's what's wrong with you . "	Pat O'Brien portrays the title character , a strictly by the book rookie patrolman in New York's 7th Precinct , in this formulaic story that will have you experience a range of emotions , as does O'Malley before it's all over . " I just love to watch him pull out that manual " - so says newspaper reporter Pinky Holden ( Hobart Cavanaugh ) , who takes great pleasure in taking shots at O'Malley and the Police Department under his byline . O'Malley is so strict in fact , that he pulls out the manual and admonishes his own mother when she throws a handful of crumbs out her apartment window for the birds - it's littering after all ! When O'Malley stops John Phillips ( Humphrey Bogart ) for a loud muffler , it causes Phillips to be late for his first job in a long time . With a wife and young daughter , Phillips loses his chance for work when he arrives late and finds the gate to his factory job shut down . You can more or less guess what follows - the frustrated Phillips accidentally injures a pawn shop owner and takes four hundred dollars out of the till . Arrested and sentenced to a minimum two year prison stretch , Mrs . Phillips ( Frieda Inescort ) is left alone to care for daughter Babs ( Sybil Jason ) , who's suffered a knee injury that cannot receive proper medical attention because of their meager circumstances . O'Malley realizes what he's done and attempts to set things right , even though by now , the neighborhood takes him for a real hard nosed pain in the butt . Ultimately , it's young Babs Phillips who helps O'Malley understand the error of his ways , at first not knowing of her connection to the man he helped put away . The humbled officer seeks medical treatment for the young girl , and arranges for Phillips ' early parole , all in secret . By the time the story ends , O'Malley has done a complete turn , and is now the one who tries to model compassion for his captain and fellow officers . Filmed in 1937 , " The Great O'Malley " is an excellent period piece of city life and neighborhood relationships . Without giving too much away , take note of the blood transfusion scene in the latter part of the movie to see how far medicine has evolved in seventy years . Pat O'Brien and Humphrey Bogart made a total of four films together , with O'Brien top billed over Bogey in each - the others being " China Clipper " , " San Quentin " , and the minor classic " Angels With Dirty Faces " , all made within the space of three years , 1936-1938 . For her part , actress Ann Sheridan appeared with both actors in this film and " San Quentin " , all are recommended .
" Lots of fellas live and die without ever having to find out how much of a man they are " .	If you've seen Jimmy Cagney in a few of his famous gangster roles , his appearance in a Western might be enough to make you scratch your head . I had that reaction the first time , when I caught him as a ' good ' bad guy in " The Oklahoma Kid " , opposite another actor you might peg the same way - Humphrey Bogart . That picture was filmed in 1939 and you had a much younger Cagney riding hell bent for leather and engaging in a wild saloon brawl with his co-star . Even so , he was forty years old at the time , while here , he's in his mid fifties and a bit slower on the draw as his character Matt Dow emphasizes a number of times . Cagney appears a bit more comfortable in his role here than he did as ' The Kid ' , in fact I did a few double takes as he resembled an older Audie Murphy a few times . The story has a couple of interesting turns , starting right out of the gate when Matt Dow hooks up with local cowpoke Davey Bishop , and they unwittingly fall into possession of a train payroll when two employees who have been robbed before under similar circumstances figure it would be easier to just give it up . Bishop is portrayed by John Derek , who I've seen in a few Westerns as well , and he too looks like he'd be more comfortable in a different type of film , say as an angst ridden youth or a slick motorcycle gang member . Although I did like him in " Fury at Showdown " , another Western with a great brawl , maybe the best I've ever seen , if not the longest . While Bishop recovers from severe wounds received by the posse that hunted them down for the lost payroll , Cagney's character sparks up a romantic interest with the woman who nurses Bishop back to health . At first I wasn't sure if Helga Swenson ( Viveca Lindfors ) was using Matt to get to know Bishop better ; she appeared a lot closer in age to the younger sidekick . I guess it could have been written either way , but this was Cagney's picture . It was clever the way Cagney's character got old man Swenson ( Jean Hersholt ) to allow Matt to earn his keep while Davey recovered . The old guy was pretty sharp though , he knew what Matt was doing the entire chess game before the subject of matrimony came up . The story got interesting with the robbery at the church service , leading to another twist in the story regarding Bishop's character . With greed winning out over his conscience , Bishop turns on his mentor , only to reverse himself in the finale . In a somewhat unusual ending , Matt comes through for the town folk once again , but at a price . You can see it coming , but it could have gone a couple of different ways , with the outcome another twist to your typical bad guy learning from his mistakes scenario . Here's something interesting about the casting for the picture - in Cagney's very first film , he portrayed a young hood who worked for a mobster played by Grant Withers . In this one , Withers is the outlaw who robbed the church goers . Funny how things go sometimes . The picture also offers a brief appearance by Ernest Borgnine , also as a bad guy taken out by Matt . The film was directed by Nicholas Ray , which helps explain some of the focus on John Derek's troubled character . For an even better Ray / Derek collaboration , you'll have to check out 1949's " Knock On Any Door " , with Humphrey Bogart in the lead role . Derek portrays a young man with a criminal past who reaches the end of the line when he winds up killing a cop . For his part , Nicholas Ray marked the epitome of his directorial achievement with his epic story of teenage angst - " Rebel Without A Cause " .
" You celebrating be kind to humans week ? "	It's always cool to run across a picture as absurdly titled as " I Married a Monster From Outer Space " , and even better when the picture turns out to be a whole lot better than the expectation it created . This wouldn't necessarily be everyone's cup of tea , but for schlock sci-fi movie fans of the era , this one has a nice balance of primitive alien horror effects and a story that that provides food for thought even after it's over . One of the things I noticed though as the picture progressed , there wasn't any thought of continuity in the way the aliens took over their human hosts . When Bill Farrell ( Tom Tryon ) is confronted by the alien early in the picture , the black cloud ( nice touch ) that envelops him leaves him collapsed up against his car . Later , when Bill's drinking buddy Sam is attacked , the black cloud makes the human disappear but leaves his clothes . Finally , when the beat cop becomes victim number three , he disappears altogether ! I don't know about you , but I like to see my monster continuity maintained . There were a couple of other things that fascinated me as well - like how did alien Bill know where to drive for his honeymoon destination ? - wife Marge ( Gloria Talbott ) was asleep for half the trip ! Speaking of Marge , what do you think might have possessed her to walk up to Bill right after seeing him emit the black cloud and have the exchange with the alien and the space ship ? I don't think I would have been that curious to investigate if I had just seen something like that . But here's some really curious points to ponder . When the aliens took over the human bodies , they developed an aversion to alcohol ; now there's an interesting subtext . Also , when the police aliens confronted the man from the bar stalking Marge , they rejected taking his body because he was a ' criminal type ' ! That has to say something about how discriminating they were , don't you think ? Coming as it did during the Cold War era , " I Married a Monster From Outer Space " has been offered as another example of anti-Communist propaganda . I don't know , I think it's a real stretch to go for that analysis , even with the us vs . them , human vs . alien plot elements . You can decide later on that score , but first enjoy the movie .
" What this turkey needs is some big shot in the arm . . . "	The original theatrical trailer for " The Wagons Roll at Night " compares it favorably to Humphrey Bogart's prior two releases , " They Drive By Night " and " High Sierra " ; in it , Bogie finds himself in a non traditional role as the hard driving owner of " Coaster's Combined Circus and Carnival " . His character is Nick Coaster , a con man in his own right , always looking for the angle that will make his circus a top attraction . As his alcoholic lion tamer Hoffman the Great ( Sig Ruman ) becomes increasingly unreliable , the chance escape of Caesar the Lion results in his being subdued by a local grocery clerk , Matt Varney ( Eddie Albert ) . Sensing the excitement that a home town hero would bring to his operation , Nick whets Varney's appetite for fame under the Big Top as his next major attraction . Eddie Albert brings all the laid back corn pone demeanor to a role that would be a fitting rehearsal for his future " Green Acres " character . However " Varney of the Lions " hits a brick wall when he meets and falls in love with Nick's sister Mary ( Joan Leslie ) ; she's all starry eyed and hungry for romance , fresh from graduation yet stuck on Nick's country farm . Nick has always been protective of his sister , and wants to shelter her from the " road show vermin " that work for him . This Nick Coaster is not a nice guy , and his plan to take Matt out of the picture sinks him to a new level . Rounding out the main cast is Sylvia Sidney as Nick's erstwhile girl friend and circus psychic , Madame Florina . Also smitten by Varney , she does the honorable thing and steps aside , as Matt confides his feelings for Mary to her - " Can you imagine anyone being in love with me ? " For her part , Joan Leslie as Mary portrays the wide eyed innocence and goodness of the girl next door , who reminded me an awful lot of Judy Garland's Dorothy in " The Wizard of Oz " . Leslie looks like she could have been a natural for that role as well . If nothing else , the film is memorable as one of the few in which Bogie's character cashes in his chips at the end . Coming to his senses at the provocation of Flo and Mary , Nick enters the circus cage that would have been Matt's death trap while facing down the killer Caesar . It's a moment of redemption for a con artist , who even at death's door is getting ready for his next gig - " I wonder if they can use a smart promoter where I'm going ' ? "
" Welcome to the Brotherhood . "	You expect intense action with the X-Men franchise and this one delivers as well . For my money though , the film is all over itself trying to be the greatest action adventure of all time , especially in the second half . I'd have preferred a bit more character development replacing some of the fight scenes , but hey , it's not my prerogative . There are almost 1400 posts on this film already , so I won't go into the story line . I WILL say I was happy to catch Stan Lee in his almost obligatory cameo early on and didn't have to strain to catch his appearance . You have to pay attention though , he shows up quickly as a homeowner watering his lawn in the twenty years ago flashback scene with Professor X , pre-Magneto and the young Jean Grey . I was also impressed with the way Kelsey Grammar mutated into his role as The Beast . Although it's hard to keep the Frasier personality out of it , I'll admit I only thought about it when he made his first appearance . There were a few downers though . Jean Grey's re-appearance following her demise in the prior film wasn't addressed at all , nor did her destruction of Scott bear any significance other than to provide a jolt to the viewer . I know that death in comics and soap operas don't mean a thing , but some sort of explanation would have helped on each score . Logan / Wolverine does the quick healing process one better this time out . When he takes that double shot to the stomach in the forest battle , he's able to heal the holes in his t-shirt too ; how about that ? For those who believe things come in threes , rest assured this is not the end of the X-Men franchise in film . That was established after all the endless credits rolled . Speaking of which , film credits these days are out of control . I mean , do we really need to know who made Wolverine's claws ( It was the ' Claw King ' ) , and who catered for the cast ? Back to my prior thought . If you wondered about that scene at the hospital with Xavier and the comatose paraplegic , you find out why in the last five seconds or less . The voice of the man in the coma speaks to the duty nurse , and there's no escaping it was Patrick Stewart's .
" Try not to puke , you may have to lie in it a long time . "	His adopted white name was John Russell , the Apaches called him Ishkanay . If you didn't know either , he was simply ' Hombre ' , the Man . I was startled to see Paul Newman's first appearance in the film , he definitely could pass for an Indian . His character is a man of few words , though when he speaks it counts for something . When his heritage is discovered by a handful of stage travelers , he's relegated to sitting out the journey atop the coach next to driver Mendez ( Martin Balsam ) . For that honor , he gets to defend their racism and hypocrisy with his life . " Hombre " is a little known but powerful Western casting Newman as a white man raised by Apaches , to which he returns after seeing just how civilized the white world can be . Though he inherits a two story house from the father who raised him , that doesn't figure much in the story . Instead , Hombre puts his cunning and survival skills to good use when outlaw Grimes ( Richard Boone ) and his gang attempt to rob a motley group of stagecoach travelers . Central to the group is Indian Agent Dr . Favor ( Fredric March ) , who carries on a running battle of wills of his own with Newman's character . It'a always a treat for me to have Richard Boone pop up in a film , his portrayal of Paladin in the TV series " Have Gun Will Travel " was always a favorite . Somehow he's even more delightful as a villain , and here he's about as nasty as they come ; he's so tough he doesn't need to take water along to fend off the desert heat , only whiskey . Obviously , one has a pretty good idea of how this one will end , but the formula is turned on it's head with a stunner ; Hombre doesn't survive the final showdown with Grimes and his Mexican bandit guide ( Frank Silvera ) . In death as in life , Hombre was his own man , who's stoicism was ever focused on what's right , not who's right .
" Whew , I hope I never have another five minutes like that again . "	George Raft and Humphrey Bogart portray Joe and Paul Fabrini , trying to get ahead in pre-War California as long haul drivers , one might call them a couple of brother truckers . The film is difficult to categorize , other than being another of Warner Brothers ' social commentaries , offering the gritty side of a tough life where long hours and a strict work ethic might turn into success . Life is never that simple though , and the Fabrini's are thrown about as many curves as the roads they travel . The pair are complemented by a superb cast , with Ann Sheridan second billed to Raft as a saucy roadside diner waitress who has the best line in the film . When some truckers at the counter crack wise about her " classy chassis " , the quick double entendre comeback is about as risqué as you'll hear this far back in film - " . . . you couldn't even pay for the headlights . " It's easy come , easy go for the brothers when they make a quick score with a load of lemons that allows them to pay off their rig . Shortly after though , the weary Paul falls asleep at the wheel , careening over an embankment and destroying the truck . With Paul losing his right arm as a result of the accident , brother Joe falls in with old friend Ed Carlsen ( Alan Hale ) , and becomes the trucking manager for Ed's firm . That's when the plot thickens , as Ed's wife Lana ( Ida Lupino ) tries to get her claws into Joe , constantly being rebuffed by Joe's gracious manner and loyalty to Cassie ( Sheridan ) . Now here's the mark of a good actress . Lupino is so convincing as the movie's perfect villainess that you'll want to reach right into the screen to grab her by the neck . Lana Carlsen literally crosses the line when she leaves her drunk husband behind closed garage doors with the car running . When Joe springs the news that he's about to marry Cassie , Lana recants her earlier story to the authorities and blames Ed's death on Joe . The courtroom scene where Lupino's character falls apart is presaged by a handful of scenes where she's deathly afraid of automatic doors . Her maniacal rant , " The doors made me do it " repeated over and over caused a chuckle with this viewer . I wonder what Jim Morrison would have thought if the movie was made in the 1960's . In an odd bit of serendipity , as I sit down to write this review , the Doors ' hit " L . A . Woman " is playing on the radio , with the haunting refrain " City of Night " . How's that for cosmic coincidence ? I'm always on the lookout for revealing scenes in films that show just how dated they are . When the brothers fill up at a gas station early on , their bill for seventy gallons of gas and three quarts of oil is $12 . 90 ! ! ! And Joe has to charge it ! Besides the players already mentioned , let's give credit to Roscoe Karns as fellow wildcat driver ' Irish ' McGurn , constantly waylaid by his fascination for pinball machines . Karns has a role usually reserved for Warner contract players like Frank McHugh or Allen Jenkins . He's also given his share of clever one liners , when he hooks up with a ditsy blonde ( Joyce Compton in an uncredited role ) he offers an offhanded compliment - " Sit down and have a drink , it's drinkin ' makes you beautiful " . Rounding out the main cast is Gale Page as Paul's patient wife Pearl , who loses some sympathy when she sees her husband's accident as a blessing that will keep him home now . That angle could probably have been handled a lot better . George Raft and Humphrey Bogart only teamed up one other time , a hard to come by 1939 gangster film , " Invisible Stripes " . In that one , the pair find themselves on the other side of the law as criminals . " They Drive by Night " is generally regarded as the better of the two movies , but as a Bogart fan , I'll recommend both .
" If we don't end war , war will end us . "	The message of a world on the brink of war is disregarded by the masses ; the mythical city of Everytown in 1940 represents England in general , but it could just as well stand for any nation of the world . When war finally does arrive , it's ravages continue not for another five years , but until 1966 at which time Everytown is completely destroyed . Adding to the desolation and toll on humanity is the " wandering sickness " , a pestilence that continues for another four years . " Things to Come " balances both a fatalistic and futuristic world view , where science holds out a hope for a revived civilization . The " Wings Over the World " concept plays out a bit corny , though it's spokesman Cabal ( Raymond Massey ) is unwavering in his mission and dedicated to his cause . If he fails , others will follow . This message is continually reinforced throughout the film , brought home convincingly in Massey's end of movie speech . Man's insatiable need to test the limits of knowledge and achievement requires an " all the universe or nothing " mindset . The film's imagery of automation and machinery in the second half is reminiscent of the great silent film " Metropolis " . As Everytown is rebuilt and transformed by the year 2036 , the spectacle of the city's rebirth strikes a resonant chord , as architecture of modern cities of today suggest the movie's eerily prophetic vision is coming to fruition . Where the movie gets it wrong by sixty seven years though is man's first mission to the moon , but in 1936 , a hundred year timetable probably seemed more legitimate than 1969 . " Things to Come " is one of those rarities in film , a picture that makes you think . Which side will you come down on , the forces for advancement in the face of uncertainty or maintain the status quo ? It's not a comfortable question , as both choices offer inherent dangers and unknowable outcomes . Those who choose to be bystanders risk being swept away by forces beyond their control .
" ' Scuse me while I kiss the sky . "	The channel surfing gods must have been watching over me last night , as I came across this documentary on VH1 Classics under their ' RockDocs ' format . As I tuned in , Hendrix was into his amazing " Wild Thing " version from 1967's Monterey Pop Festival and it had me hooked for the entire run . Jimi Hendrix was always a favorite of mine back in the Sixties , and when he died in 1970 , I became fixated on his ' Electric Ladyland ' album , seeming to find comfort in the ethereal strains of ' Moon , Turn The Tides . . . Gently , Gently ' , as if he were floating away to a far off better place . Besides the awesome live footage , the blast in watching this biopic has to be seeing rock gods speaking in reverenced tones of the guitar master . Were Mick Jagger , Lou Reed , Pete Townshend , Eric Clapton and Little Richard ever really that young ? It was revealing to hear Townshend describe how he and Clapton talked about Hendrix and his music , and how they ' decided ' that they liked him - as if it had to be a conscious choice . Other revealing insights came from some of the women in Hendrix ' life who I didn't know about at the time , like Fayne Pridgon and Pat Hartley . Even feminist Germaine Greer got into the act , with observations on how his music impacted male audiences of the era . An interesting element that worked for the documentary was interspersing scenes of live music and interviews with televised segments from a Dick Cavett TV appearance , where Hendrix ' low key manner seemed to belie his vulnerability . I never realized how insecure he felt about himself , and how malleable he was to the pressures of agents and hangers on , eventually leading to his tragic end . One of the Allen Brothers had an interesting twist on Hendrix ' passing , stating that the singer might have been experiencing an alpha state in which he consciously decided to experience death , resulting in an ' alpha jerk ' . A curious aside to the Dick Cavett appearance - sitting next to Hendrix on the guest couch was Robert Young . I wonder if Hendrix ever watched " Father Knows Best " ? Above all though , it's the man and the music that make this rockumentary special . My personal favorites - " Wild Thing " and the amazing Dylan tribute " Like a Rolling Stone " . Of course the Woodstock " Star Spangled Banner " version is on display in it's entirety , as are all of the song performances presented , making this picture a unique tribute to the rock legend . Had he lived , Hendrix would be sixty years old today , and oh , what music might have been .
" The point is , you are alive when they start to eat you . "	As a fan of ' B ' grade sci-fi and horror films of the 1930's through the ' 50's , I always get a kick out of the scientific rationale offered behind some new experiment or discovery . In " Jurassic Park " , dinosaurs have left behind their blueprints as preserved DNA strands in the blood of prehistoric mosquitoes trapped in amber - I love it ! ! ! Could anything sound more convincing to make you believe that dinosaur cloning is possible ? The buzz surrounding this monster film in 1993 took the movie world by storm , and with good reason . Here finally was a film where dinosaurs actually looked real , and responding just the way we might be inclined to think of them . A brachiosaurus nibbles from the tops of trees and tyrannosaurs literally shake the ground they walk on . There were even a few creatures thrown into the mix I'd never heard of when reading about dinosaurs as a kid - like when were velociraptors discovered ? Seeing the movie the first time I thought they were invented for the film until I did some research . Now one or two beasts at a time is remarkable enough , but the scene that really mesmerized me was the dinosaur stampede , once again with creatures I never knew about . If one is a gallimimus , would more than one be gallimimuses or gallimimi ? Just wondering . You would expect outstanding performances from the principal players , and all did well , but I found the acting of the kids ( Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards ) to be exceptional . Their expressions of wonder , awe , excitement and outright terror are conveyed as convincingly as if they suddenly found themselves actually surrounded by live dinosaurs . Ariana Richards ' expression in particular , in the scene where her brother might have been electrocuted is almost heartbreaking . " Jurassic Park " is one of those pictures you can take literally when it comes to a movie going ' experience ' . The film was the first to be recorded in DTS digital surround sound , thereby adding to it's thrill as an auditory as well as visual treat . A little over a decade since it's original release , it's the kind of movie that just begs for the home theater treatment .
" Brother when they hang that number one tag on you they shoot first and argue afterwards , I know . "	By 1941 , Humphrey Bogart had nearly a dozen gangster roles to his credit , but in " High Sierra " we get to see a criminal with a heart . That aspect of Roy Earle's ( Bogey ) nature is played out with the chance meeting of Pa Goodhue ( Henry Travers ) and his pretty niece Velma ( Joan Leslie ) . Though their age difference is plainly visible , Earle experiences a pang of feeling for Velma , even though she is handicapped with a clubfoot . The story within a story of Roy's white knight effort to cure Velma's malady and find a way out of his life of crime is eventually derailed , but not before the viewer gets a chance to observe a tough guy's soft side . But then there's his hard side . Fresh out of Mossmoor prison , Roy Earle wastes no time in hooking up with former gangster friend Big Mack ( Donald MacBride ) who had arranged his early release , and has already lined up Roy's next big payday . Roy will have to get heavy handed with two rookie sidekicks ( Arthur Kennedy , Alan Curtis ) , who between them are juggling a pretty " dime a dance " girl along for the ride . The would be moll is Marie Garson ( Ida Lupino ) , who with one look at Earle instinctively knows her two companions are in over their head . Roy tries to keep his distance from Marie , but when Velma makes it clear that she's marrying another man , Earle's romantic interest in Marie is driven up a notch . The film makes good use of Warner Brothers stock players . Barton MacLane is on hand as a rogue cop who's taken up with Earle's boss Big Mack . Henry Travers is put to good use in a role that serves as a warm up for that of Clarence the Angel in " It's A Wonderful Life " . Cornel Wilde and Jerome Cowan find themselves in limited roles , Wilde as the smarmy Mendoza who sets up the hotel heist , and then rats out Roy to the authorities . And let's not forget Old Pard , the friendly mutt with an attraction to people who wind up dead . Pard had a good acting coach , he was Bogey's real life pet dog Zero . The newspapers hang a ' Mad Dog ' tag on Roy following the botched hotel heist and Earle's shooting death of Jack Kranmer ( MacLane ) . Presumably seeing Marie off to safety , he finds himself on the run and seeking refuge in the shadow of Mt . Whitney . Reacting to a radio broadcast , Marie retraces her steps back to witness Roy's stand against the police , knowing that he'll never allow himself to be taken alive . However Earle's final defeat doesn't have the defiance of Cagney's in " White Heat " , no ' top of the world Ma ' challenge to incite the authorities . In the end , a big time hood falls in disgrace . By then , you get the feeling that Marie already knows the answer to her own question when she asks a reporter - " Mister , what does it mean when a man crashes out ? " You may be surprised as I was to learn that Ida Lupino was actually top billed over Humphrey Bogart in " High Sierra " ; I'd be curious as to the politics involved in that decision . Though her performance is very good , her actual screen time is considerably less than Bogey's . Lupino also excelled in another team up with Bogart , that of the vile and conniving wife who murdered her husband in " They Drive by Night " . Catch that one for her intense courtroom scene , it's a blast .
" . . . God's grace is sorta like retroactive . . . "	The unique quality of " Freedomland " lies in the fact that the film consistently leaves something just out of the viewer's reach , just as Julianne Moore's character does the same in her relationship with detective Lorenzo Council ( Samuel L . Jackson ) . The film is unnerving enough with the drama of a potentially abducted child ; it serves up additional tension with it's backdrop of strained race relations at a New Jersey housing project . In that respect , the movie may in fact be more about how not only different races see each other , but how different economic classes within the same ethnic community relate to each other . It's a precarious tightrope on which the film is balanced , and is made especially heart breaking when the lost child's fate is eventually revealed . Jackson is effective as ever as the black man in the middle , but the performance of the film has to be that of Julianne Moore . At times , the viewer must consider whether she's back on drugs , psychotic , having a mental breakdown , or just flat out lying . The mental anguish and pain etched on her face throughout the story makes her a believable character , and quite sadly reminds us that there are real people out there in the world suffering through the same type of ordeals , self inflicted or not . " Freedomland " is not the type of film you watch for entertainment , but once involved in the story , you find yourself straining to pick up that missing link that will make the entire story fall into place . Once it does , you'll feel no better for having solved the mystery , for as in real life , one doesn't always come away with a happy ending .
" I can smell trouble right here in this apartment . "	The great thing about " Rear Window " is how Hitchcock puts the viewer in the point of view of Jimmy Stewart's lead character L . B . Jeffries . It's a bit weird actually how you find yourself anticipating Jeffries ' reactions because you're thinking the way he does as he scans his neighbors ' apartments in an almost lurid act of voyeurism . What's problematic though , and what comes across as unrealistic today is how so many apartment dwellers can live without ever worrying that their activities ought to be concealed . Forget about the murderer for a minute and consider every other tenant featured in their mini-vignettes - Miss Lonelyhearts , Miss Torso , the Songwriter , the newlyweds , the doggy elevator couple . It seems to be a precarious way to live , like being in a glass enclosure or a cage in a zoo . That's why Jeffries ' solution of Mrs . Thorwald's murder is just a little too pat . He's got all the twists and turns worked out in the face of conflicting evidence to the contrary , mostly supplied by his detective friend Doyle ( Wendell Corey ) . Yet it's important to be in on the identity of the murderer to keep the tension building to a dramatic conclusion . Jeffries has ample support in building the case with the help of fiancée Lisa Fremont ( Grace Kelly ) and his temporary caregiver Stella ( Thelma Ritter ) . Stella is the perfect character to inject needed comic relief as Hitchcock layers the film with increasing levels of mystery and suspense . In fact , she's got the best line in the movie - " . . . just where do you suppose he cut her up ? " One of the neat things I learned about the film is how Hitchcock got around Paramount's limited set to replicate a city apartment complex . The building used in the film was only two stories high , so to get the illusion of a much larger unit , Hitchcock got the studio to cut into the basement . Jimmy Stewart's apartment was really at ground level on the actual set , thereby creating the impression that he was spying on apartments above , below and across from his own . One of the other cool tricks used in the story revolved around the Songwriter , and how the music emanating from his apartment served as a sound track for those scenes . It's where the director appeared in one of his trademark cameo appearances . If you were paying attention , you also learned that the writer got the inspiration for his songs from the landlady once a month ! For anyone new to the films of Alfred Hitchcock , this might be the best example of his American pictures , as it combines all the elements that he came to be noted for - mystery , intrigue , murder , an everyman character one can identify with , and the clever insertion of wit and humor to pace the film to an exciting finale . It's also one of the best examples of Hitchcock's pure cinema technique , replete with sophisticated use of camera angles , composition , lighting and perspective .
" Death can be very useful sometimes . "	At some point , I'll have to research the mystery behind the concept of ' The Man With No Name ' , because in this , the genre creating Western establishing Clint Eastwood as an international star , his name was Joe , and it was clearly stated more than once . Yet here was something different , a mono-syllabic , no nonsense anti-hero who spoke with his guns and his fists , and sometimes it was a toss up as to which was louder . The intrigue and novelty of his character is established early - " My mistake . . . four coffins " . From there , the body count takes on a life ( death ? ) of it's own , played out as a gang war between the Rojo's and the Baxter's , with No Name Joe the fuse , often as short as the cheroot dangling from his lips . Amid the blood and bullets , I guess the reason for the popularity of Eastwood's persona is that at his core , he's a loyal and honorable character . He rescues his benefactor Silvanito ( Jose Calvo ) from torture , and comes to the aid of Ramon's unwilling mistress Marisol ( Marianne Koch ) . Here's a guy you can beat to a bloody pulp and he keeps on ticking , but it's the ticking of a time bomb about to explode . I particularly enjoyed the clever way he took out the rotund Chico ( Mario Brega ) by shooting out the door posts , that had to be quite the headache . With my most recent viewing , I was particularly impressed with the Ennio Morricone score , perhaps not the best he would ever come up with , but new and different enough for the era to mark his arrival on the scene . Not only was the spaghetti Western something new , but so was it's hallmark music . The movie's most quoted lines have to do with the four coffins and the ' aim for the heart ' business , but midway through , Silvanito got a response out of me at the Rio Bravo massacre with " It's like playing cowboys and Indians " . Eastwood also sums things up nicely following the final confrontation between the Rojo's and Baxter's - " Let's go , the show's over anyway " .
" . . . your father made him to live always . "	How great was today , the American Movie Channel offered back to back showings of " Frankenstein " , " Bride of Frankenstein " and " Son of Frankenstein " as part of it's ten day Halloween fest . For the latter two films , it was my first opportunity ever to view both , and it made for a wonderfully entertaining day . Basil Rathbone appears as the titled " Son " of Dr . Henry Frankenstein , the Colin Clive role in the first two films . In perhaps an odd coincidence , reference is made in the story to Scotland Yard relative to six murders ; in his very next film , " The Hound of the Baskervilles " , Rathbone would begin a hugely successful run as detective Sherlock Holmes . There are a number of departures from the earlier movies , the main one being Boris Karloff's entirely differentiated attire from the ' classic ' look of the Frankenstein monster . Here he's wearing an out of character ( at least for me ) sheepskin type vest , reduced to the guttural grunting of the first film , whereas he was learning to speak in the interim film " Bride " . While Dr . Henry Frankenstein's assistants in the first two movies were named Fritz and Karl ( both portrayed by Dwight Frye ) , this is the one in which we're introduced to the familiar ' Ygor ' sidekick , masterfully played by Bela Lugosi . Now if the appearance of Rathbone , Karloff and Lugosi weren't enough , this film adds Lionel Atwill in a role that's almost a caricature , that of police Inspector Krogh . Perhaps I've been contaminated by the Kenneth Mars role in " Young Frankenstein " , but if I had never seen this film , I would have believed Mel Brooks made up the whole dart scene in his screen send up . Instead , when Krogh rams all those darts into his wooden arm , I could no longer contain myself . In fact , more than any other Frankenstein film in the series , this one probably provides the most fodder for director Brooks in his hilarious offering . How about Elsa von Frankenstein's reply to ' that awful knocker " ? And didn't Gene Wilder bear just a little more resemblance to Rathbone's character than can be explained by mere coincidence ? And when you get right down to it , those arm gyrations of the Inspector made it almost seem like " Son " was a parody of " Young Frankenstein " and not vice versa . Getting back to the matter at hand , it did seem to me though that the film got more and more camp as it progressed . By the time Baron Wolf is confronted by Krogh near the end of the film , he's ( Wolf ) just about over the top with his explanation of Ygor's demise - " He tried to murder me with his hammer , so I shot him " . Besides that , he seemed pretty deadly with the darts , it looked like he hit the bulls eye more than once . If you have the chance , try to view the Frankenstein films in order of release , as each sequel builds on the events of the prior movie . If that's not possible , no problem , as each movie stands on it's own legs pretty successfully as well . As an added bonus , throw in " Young Frankenstein " as the cherry topping onto the mix , it will only add to your appreciation of all three .
" What this country needs is bigger and better patriots . "	As if to counterpoint the darker drama to follow , the initial scene of " Black Legion " opens to a factory setting with it's workers all dressed in bright white uniforms , with names neatly embroidered over each man's left pocket . Contrast that with the black anonymity of hooded members of the titled organization , and you have Warner Brothers take on another facet of injustice in pre-war America . Humphrey Bogart portrays Frank Taylor , a disaffected employee passed over for a promotion to a book reading , intelligent Polish worker . While his work suffers his ego simmers , ripe for the pseudo intellectual babble of a disembodied voice on the radio clamoring for the rights of native white American workers . When the time is right , fellow employee Cliff Summers ( Joe Sawyer ) introduces Frank to an organization known as the Black Legion , championing the rights of workers , while engaging in night time raids on those they wish to eliminate . Taylor's induction into the Legion is conveyed with the utmost symbolism , vowing an oath to the death to protect it's secrets , while a gun points to his head to insure his allegiance . Taylor's involvement with the group comes at the expense of his family , wife Ruth ( Erin O'Brien Moore ) and son Buddy ( Dickie Jones ) . They attempt to keep him honest , as does friend Ed Jackson ( Dick Foran ) , but before long , Taylor is in so deep he no longer recognizes himself . As Jackson learns of his friend's involvement in the group's local hostilities , the situation reaches a boiling point for Frank , and the legion kidnaps Ed for a traditional whipping . It's Taylor's own handgun that cuts Ed down as he attempts to break free , putting Frank over the edge and setting him up for capture by the authorities . As newspaper headlines proclaim " Jackson Killing Bares Black Legion " , Taylor faces threats of harm to his family if he testifies against them while in jail . In a scene reminiscent of James Cagney's breakdown at the end of " Angels With Dirty Faces " , Bogey's character erupts a confession while on trial , bringing down the participants in his crime and exposing the Legion's secrets . In a follow up scene , the entire leadership of the organization involved in Jackson's murder stand trial and are sentenced to life in prison . The textbook speech by the judge ( Samuel S . Hinds ) to the defendants is a resounding affirmation of the American right to freedom and opportunity . The Warner Brothers films of the era did a good , if sometimes melodramatic job of presenting the ills of society in an unfavorable light . More noted for their crime and gangster dramas , they also keyed in on the effects of poverty ( 1937's " Dead End " ) and wildcat truckers ( 1940's " They Drive by Night " ) ; it seems there wasn't a subject they wouldn't touch . This film still resonates nearly seventy years following it's original release , presenting it's condemnation of a hate group characteristic of a " new Ku Klux Klan " .
" Alright Mr . Maryk , which are you , a fool or a mutineer , there's no third possibility . "	Though most of the action takes place aboard a mine sweeper in the ' junkyard Navy ' , the real drama occurs in the tense courtroom scene and it's aftermath in " The Caine Mutiny " . The spiral of events that result in Captain Queeg's ( Humphrey Bogart ) mental breakdown at first has the viewer sympathizing with Communications Officer Keefer ( Fred MacMurray ) and Executive Officer Maryk ( Van Johnson ) . That however is turned entirely on it's head by the cunning insight of defense attorney Greenwald ( Jose Ferrer ) once the military trial is over . The film will test your willingness to accept first impressions and brings to mind that things are not always what they seem . The military court scene is brilliantly done . When Queeg reaches for the steel worry beads , the sound of the metal clacking will be enough to create the doubt needed in the minds of the military judges as to his fitness for command . Up to that point though , it looked like Queeg's service reputation was a slam dunk to send Maryk and Ensign Keith ( Robert Francis ) to a court martial or worse . Here's a question - when Bogey's character becomes determined to expose the strawberry thief on board ship , where did he get sand from to conduct the experiment ? Why not sugar , it was already part of the mess menu . Just wondering . Seeing Lee Marvin and Claude Akins in non-descript early roles as ' Meatball ' and ' Horrible ' aboard the mine sweeper was a treat for this viewer , along with the uncredited appearance of character actor James Best . Fine performances are also put in by E . G . Marshall as Commander Challee at the trial , and Tom Tully who book ends his role in the film as Commander DeVriess . Humphrey Bogart's performance as the tortured Queeg earned a Best Actor nomination , and in fact was his most stirring performance in a military themed film . Apart from his gangster persona , Bogey also did quite well in " Action in the North Atlantic " ( 1943 ) ; " Sahara " ( 1943 ) ; and " Battle Circus " ( 1953 ) . All are recommended by this fan of the actor .
" We got you here Charlie , to tell you you've just been signed by our ball club . . . "	There's the great scene in " The Public Enemy " where Cagney leans against the lamppost in the rain , defining his character and persona as a force to be reckoned with . In " Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye " , it's the one where the oblique upward camera angle captures Ralph Cotter over the garage pit right after he dumps the body of Vic Mason ( Rhys Williams ) . It personifies the ' stark staring nuts ' quality of Cagney's character , ranking him right up there with Tom Powers and Cody Jarrett . The film skillfully weaves together strands of various sub plots to create a masterful gangster drama , even if it isn't as well known as Jimmy Cagney's premier movies . Teaming up Ward Bond and Barton MacLane as corrupt cops comes in stark contrast to their pairing in Bogart's " The Maltese Falcon " ; it never took much time for Inspector Weber ( Bond ) to cave in to Cotter's demands when it meant a bigger and bigger payoff . Somehow I don't think the cheesecake calendar in Weber's office would be deemed politically correct today . I'm a bit apprehensive over the Holiday Carleton character , I actually found her to be somewhat pathetic , particularly when she trades lip locks with Cotter after he slaps her around with a towel . Then again right after she manages to miss Cotter with all that kitchen artillery . For Cotter to be attracted to her didn't require much of a stretch though , he was as much a womanizer as a maniac . Here's a puzzler . When it was revealed that Ezra Dobson was the most powerful man in the state , and that he could get the goods on anyone within twenty four hours , how is it he didn't find out that there was no such person as Paul Murphy ? As mad as he was when he first discovered Cotter / Murphy and his daughter together , I wonder what he would have done if he hadn't caught the newlyweds fully clothed in separate beds . Even though a modern day remake of the film would find a way to eliminate those pesky plot points , I'm not sure you'll ever find a better gangster to take a powder on screen than Cagney's death scene here , in an ode to the movie's title ; it was brilliant . If one didn't know better , it looks like it might have reflected a personal experience . I wonder though , if an earlier line uttered by an off screen elevator operator was meant to reference Cotter's ultimate fate when he asked - " Going down ? "
" I concede nothing , until they throw dirt in my face . "	Though limited by the technology and writing of the era , " 13 Rue Madeleine " stands as an effective and exciting espionage thriller . I couldn't help thinking that if made today , it might prove worthy as a contender for a number of major film awards . James Cagney is top billed as a successful espionage agent , now training recruits for Secret Intelligence . His newest class , Operation 77 , contains a German agent . However rather than simply exposing the agent , the mission intriguingly evolves to planting false information regarding a second front in Europe to misdirect the Nazis and gain time for the Allies in preparation for D-Day . An associated goal of locating a scientist in the employ of Vichy France would also help uncover the location of German warheads aimed at England . A major part of the story revolves around the Nazi double agent Kuncel ( Richard Conte ) masquerading as a recruit for Sharkey's ( Cagney ) outfit . When he unwittingly ( and unknowingly ) outs himself in a set up that exposes his experience , Sharkey and his superiors go to work planting misinformation regarding Plan B - the invasion of Germany through the Dutch lowlands . At the same time , they make their one mistake , allowing agent Lassiter ( Frank Latimore ) to know the real identity of his buddy O'Connell . While on a mission , Lassiter's demeanor changes enough to give himself away , and O'Connell / Kuncel has no trouble doing what Lassiter might have - he kills him by severing his parachute jump line . Once the film gets under way following the training sequences , the film builds with tension and mystery . Lending support to the main story are Annabella as part of the Sharkey O-77 team , and Sam Jaffe as French Mayor Gallimard . A rare highlight of the film has Annabella's character suffering a violent death when discovered by the Nazis , not the norm for a female lead . For film buffs , it's a hoot to catch uncredited performances by future stars like Karl Malden , E . G . Marshall and Red Buttons . The picture's title comes from the address of Gestapo Headquarters in Paris , and trivia fans might be interested in something I picked up after watching this quite a while ago for the first time . Shortly after , I caught the Charlie Chan film " The Trap " from 1946 . In that story , the killer uncovered by Chan once maintained a Paris address that happened to be right across the street - at 14 Rue Madeleine !
" A type like that is an animal , so you've got to fight him like an animal , that's my advice . "	" Cape Fear " is an hour and a half long movie on a short fuse , ignited by Robert Mitchum's visceral portrayal of villain Max Cady , recently released from an eight year prison hitch for rape . The testimony of Sam Bowden ( Gregory Peck ) helped put him away , and for that exercise he's about to pay dearly . Now a lawyer , Bowden finds himself suddenly searching for intricacies in the law that will allow him and the authorities to keep Cady reigned in . But this is one clever fellow , and as a viewer , you find yourself wanting to reach right into the screen and wreak vengeance on Cady yourself , so despicable and smarmy is the character that threatens the peace and sanity of an otherwise charming Southern couple and their young daughter . Polly Bergen is Mrs . Bowden , and Lori Martin is young Nancy Bowden , who winds up being menaced for just about the entire film . In addition to the lead players , you've got some major Hollywood heavyweights lending their talents in supporting roles here ; Martin Balsam is Police Chief Dutton , and Telly Savalas with hair is private investigator Charles Sievers , hired by Bowden to learn Cady's intentions . A number of seamy scenarios are presented before Bowden succumbs to his baser nature , and hatches a plot to take out his aggressor with the tacit complicity of both . Cady won't go down easy though , and he remains a step ahead of Bowden at nearly every turn . When he makes his appearance on the houseboat and confronts Mrs . Bowden , the tension is palpable , and Polly Bergen's performance as she gasps for mercy is riveting . Soon enough though we learn that Cady's real objective is young Nancy , thereby extending the cat and mouse game into extra innings . As Cady emerges from the Cape Fear River drenched and oozing subdued hostility , director J . Lee Thompson draws us right into the action with a host of menacing camera angles , setting us up for the confrontation between the lawyer and the rapist . Their see saw battle is deftly handled ; Bowden's decision to go limp and pretend to be drowned allows sufficient time to gather his wits and fashion a weapon from a submerged rock . When the final reckoning comes due , you find yourself rooting for Bowden to pull the trigger , but his inner strength forces a decision to allow justice to take it's course . " Cape Fear " was remade some thirty years following the original with Robert DeNiro in the heel role , and Nick Nolte portraying lawyer Bowden . Interestingly , principals Gregory Peck , Robert Mitchum and Martin Balsam were called upon to play minor parts . Having seen the newer version first many years ago , I'll still tip my hat to the original black and white film of 1962 as my preference . Taking nothing away from the superb DeNiro , Robert Mitchum achieves an on screen menace almost effortlessly , endowing his character with a creepiness that infects every scene he's in ; he puts the fear into " Cape Fear " .
" Killing generals could get to be a habit with me . "	Wow , it's forty years since this film was made , and forty years since I last saw it . I've been revisiting some of the pictures I initially saw upon their original theatrical release in order to see how my impression of the movie might have changed over time . " The Dirty Dozen " still holds up as a strong war time drama , made most compelling for me by the way Major Reisman ( Lee Marvin ) reads each of his ' recruits ' in order to mold them into a cohesive unit . In fact it's the first third of the picture that I enjoy the most , as the major characters are introduced and we get to know just enough about each to understand how their motivations might be exploited . John Cassavetes ' portrayal of Victor Franko may have been the most complex on the surface , but Telly Savalas had an unusual assignment in the character of Archer Maggott . Although couched in religious extremism , I think the character went beyond that into a complex moral ambiguity . It was the kind of character that could have been the subject of a picture all by itself . The casting surprise , if you grew up in the 1960's , had to do with Trini Lopez as the soldier Jimenez . Until this picture , my only recollection of Lopez would be as a singer with some upbeat singles hits like " If I Had a Hammer " and " Lemon Tree " . I'm curious as to how he was selected for a part in this picture , since the other main characters were already fairly well established as actors ( Marvin , Savalas , Bronson , George Kennedy ) , or on the rise ( Donald Sutherland , Jim Brown ) . To his credit , Lopez did a fairly good job for the limited role he had . What I couldn't quite understand was why the Robert Ryan character , Colonel Breed , wound up at odds with Major Reisman and the Dozen . He was aware from the start that Reisman would be training his men in secrecy for a behind the lines mission , so it didn't seem logical to me that he would try to thwart it's progress . It was mentioned earlier that Reisman and Breed didn't see eye to eye based on a former association , but still , the new objective for which Reisman was training his men was for the good of the war effort . I've read with interest a number of the negative comments on the picture regarding the method of executing the mission via gasoline and explosives . I don't recall how that scenario was reviewed back in the late Sixties , but it seems we've come so far in terms of political correctness over the last forty years that there seems to be something to offend someone in every picture since , including cartoons . For my part , war is a dirty business where political correctness doesn't apply . Hitler didn't seem too concerned about incinerating women and children along with Jewish men as part of his ethnic cleansing program . If anything , the picture absolutely left out any hint of the savagery and brutality of Nazi officers , but I didn't read any complaints about that . Interesting . Also interesting is the point that the fictionalized events of the story were set BEFORE America's entry into the European Theater with the Allied D-Day landing at Normandy . It's easy to overlook that fact while the movie goes through it's paces , as the viewer's memory tends to recall events and battles of World War II that hadn't occurred yet relative to the story being told .
" You play your ball game and I'll play mine and we'll see how it comes out . "	You don't have to be a baseball fan to find the human drama gripping in this story of what came to be known as the 1919 Black Sox scandal . " Eight Men Out " tells a credible story of players directly and indirectly involved in one of the biggest sports scandals in history , even if the monetary sums involved seem meager by comparison with today . What's illuminating is the way an owner like Charlie Commiskey could get away with reneging on a promise to a star pitcher simply by not playing him and using that tactic against him . If not for Eddie Ciccote's ( David Strathairn ) disillusionment , how many dominoes would not have fallen to accept the fix offered by big time gamblers ? The story of Ciccote , much like the story of Buck Weaver and Shoeless Joe Jackson could probably fill an entire movie by itself . Having recently seen " The Sting " once again , this picture also compares favorably as a period piece of early Americana . The old uniforms and equipment are on view in abundance , and street scenes convey authenticity . The sight of men in suits with ties at a baseball game still fascinates me ; it makes me wonder when things loosened up enough to allow casual attire without showing disrespect for the game . Besides Strathairn , John Cusack delivers a fine performance as ' honest ' player Buck Weaver , and D . B . Sweeney is effectively understated as Joe Jackson . You'll also recognize Charlie Sheen and Gordon Clapp among the players , while John Mahoney is excellent as ' Kid ' Gleason , the coach who believes the best but fears the worst for his tainted players . John Anderson's appearance as Judge Landis was the surprise of the film for me , it wouldn't be far from wrong to say he appeared in just about every classic TV Western series ever made .
" Boy , a guy goes to jail for a couple of days , the whole town goes to hell . "	I can't pinpoint exactly why I enjoy this film so much , I like to call it one of my favorite movies that no one's ever heard of . I think it might have something to do with Paul Newman's character reminding me of my own father . Not that my father stole snow blowers or ever hit the trifecta , but it's just that affecting manner that makes a senior citizen a respected member of the community by dint of a lifetime of being just a regular good old guy . There's also the methodical way of speaking and listening , and coming to terms with the life one has led , even if it means having never left the small town in which you've grown up . It might also have something to do with the location of the story , since I'm from a small upstate New York town too , but heck , this could have taken place in any Smalltown , USA and it still would have connected . The story has some great dialog , with Sully ( Newman ) having the best lines , like addressing his arrogant employer Carl Roebuck ( Bruce Willis ) - " I used to believe in brains and hard work until I met you " . Or taking on the wanna be big time lawman Raymer ( Philip Seymour Hoffman ) - " This is where a smart guy would get out of the truck " . You would have to have grown up in a town of sixteen hundred residents to know that every public incident is just that , public for the whole town to know about in the blink of an eye . You know , you can't pick your family , but you can pick your friends . The thing is , by the time the picture was over , Sully was able to pick his family as well . Son Peter ( Dylan Walsh ) figured out Sully wasn't such a bad guy after all , and grandson Will came to learn that being scared was OK . There are some lessons you can take away from a worn out retread like Don Sullivan , you just have to recognize the limitations - " I am hurrying , it just looks like slow motion . " Now that I think about it some more , Beryl Peoples ( Jessica Tandy ) could have been my own grandmother too . And every small town has a Rub Squeers , I can picture that guy from my past too , even though he's passed on now . The only thing that hurts to remember is how things have changed since this film was made , not quite two decades ago . Fifteen dollars for a traffic violation ! - I paid one this year for a hundred eighty dollars ! I should have brought a Toby Roebuck with me to court .
" I'll stop when I think I'm doing the wrong thing . "	I think I'll file this one under ' best movies no one ever heard of ' , oddly enough right next to " Nobody's Fool " , which stars Robert Redford's buddy Paul Newman . Redford does a great job here of mixing together unknowns with a name supporting cast to tell a compelling spiritual tale that leaves you feeling good at the end . Fortunately , the film doesn't need a prayer to St . Jude , the patron saint of desperate causes . It's wonderful to see how Joe Mondragon's ( Chick Vennera ) accidental swipe at a sluice gate shakes up a town and makes his father's bean field a community event . Together with some of the Dancing Angel's divine intervention to spread the word in Charlie Bloom's ( John Heard ) newspaper , the town of Milagro rises up to oppose the area's development by greedy corporate fat cats . You know it's only a matter of time before the locals win out , but the fun is in seeing how they get there . Interestingly , the film's ' star ' talent doesn't seem to get in the way of the story ; Christopher Walken , Daniel Stern , John Heard , and Melanie Griffith all blend into their characters without stepping on the toes of the Milagro cast . Along the way , each of their portrayals learn something of themselves and the power of the human spirit . But the one to really keep an eye on is the town patriarch Amarante ( Carlos Riquelme ) , who combines the wisdom of the angels with the temerity to buy his bullets with food stamps . One gets the impression that he might be the next angel in training , almost certainly so as the movie comes to a close . " The Milagro Beanfield War " is certainly deserving of a wider audience . Kudos to Robert Redford for an inspiring piece of work that steps outside the boundaries of traditional Hollywood fare .
" You have awakened your demons . "	A highly stylized and psychedelic Western , I had no idea what to expect from the limited trailers offered on the Encore Western Channel . Totally unconventional , the film treads on ground that many viewers will find confusing and non-sensical , and it's not your father's Western in that respect . With so many movies nowadays it's fairly simple to come up with the ending , but this one had me entirely unprepared for the twist that revealed the way the whore Madeline died . There's also the incredible yet subtle attention to detail provided by director Jan Kounen ; who would expect that lone coyote to show up as an observer at the running battle between the Chiracahuas and Blount's posse ? Were I to be critical of the picture , it would be the abrupt transition from Mike Blueberry's ( Vincent Cassel ) youth to his showing up as a town marshal after being raised by the Chiracahuas . That , and what might have been the overdone use of the pyschedelic sequences , especially at the finale during the astral plane battle against Blount ( Michael Madsen ) . I had never thought about it before , but with Juliette and Geoffrey Lewis both in the same picture , I wondered if they might actually be father and daughter in real life . Easy enough to do with IMDb's data bank , so there's another piece of celebrity trivia confirmed . It's also curious to me how Ernest Borgnine keeps showing up in picture after picture , you would think he'd slow down after hitting his eighties . Not recommended for everyone , I'd be willing to give this movie another look the next time it's on with the hindsight of knowing the big picture . You know , it struck me that with all the spiders , scorpions and serpents slithering around in Blueberry's mind , a good alternative title would have been ' Snakes On A Plain ' .
" Just you wait , it won't be long , the man in black will soon be here . . . "	I was taken aback somewhat by the physical appearance of Peter Lorre as Beckert ; I had pictured him more like the scheming character Ugarte from " Casablanca " or the sinister henchman Joel Cairo from " The Maltese Falcon " . In " M " , he appears almost like a man-child , a roly poly round faced character who doesn't fit the profile of a child molester or murderer . Perhaps that was the point , to make him appear harmless until that creepy window scene where he wipes his lips and swoons with his evil desires while contemplating his next victim . Lorre brings out the evil in Beckert gradually over the course of the story , culminating in that agonizing appeal for mercy before the criminal underground at the finale . That in itself was a unique device for such an early talking picture , the question of whether a child murderer should be turned over to the police by a band of criminals or dealt with privately in vigilante fashion . Adding the third layer of a vagabond beggar society was also an interesting device , keeping the focus of the story at street level as it were , as the beggars used a host of ruses to keep their target in sight . It appeared to me that director Fritz Lang in this , his first talking picture , tried to maintain a link to the silent era with a number of extended scenes that relied on no sound at all . I found it almost distracting during one of the street scenes , since it seemed like it could have been a flaw in the filming rather than an intended result . Particularly since the silence drew attention to itself at the expense of expected background noise simulating street activity . The re-emergence of sound then was more like relief that the film was back on track , even if it was all the while . The other element that seemed overdone was Beckert's whistling that couldn't help but draw attention to himself . It seemed too convenient for the blind balloon man to make the connection with Beckert and Elsie Beckmann based simply on that circumstance . If it was intended to represent a subconscious desire on the part of Beckert to be caught , then that idea wasn't explored satisfactorily . Probably not , but it's interesting to consider . It's also curious to consider the similarities between this film and Lang's silent masterpiece " Metropolis " . Both utilize underground locations and capitalize on mob mentality . The tag line of " Metropolis " states that ' there can be no understanding between the hands and the brain unless the heart acts as mediator ' . Cleverly , the character of Hans Beckert exists with no understanding between his murderous hands and a sick twisted mind , and no mention at all of a non-existent heart .
" This is Duke Mantee , the world famous killer , and he's hungry . "	When you hear it said that " they don't make movies like that anymore " , you can rest assured that " The Petrified Forest " fits into that category . Though set in the sparse , almost barren confines of Black Mesa , Arizona , the film comes to life with sparkling and intelligent dialog that underscores it's mission to give meaning to the lives of it's two protagonists - Allan Squier ( Leslie Howard ) and Gabrielle " Gabby " Maple ( Bette Davis ) . Squier is a " tourist afoot " , hiking his way across the desert to the Pacific Ocean , when he finds himself in an out of the way diner populated by it's owner Jason Maple ( Porter Hall ) , daughter Gabby , Gramp Maple ( Charley Grapewin ) and an itinerant gas jockey named Boze ( Dick Foran ) . Most will find the film's tension in the presence of escaped killer Duke Mantee ( Humphrey Bogart ) , on the run from the law , and with his gang the object of the " greatest manhunt in history " . Delving deeper , it's the conflicting world views expressed by Allan and wistful dreamer Gabby that deliver the film's resonance , even as the immediate life or death threat of Mantee's muscle overtakes the film's second half . " There's something in me that wants something different " is Gabby's lament to Allan , he a world traveler who has given up his dreams as a writer and poet . Penniless , he seems almost trapped in a futile existence , though his brief visit to the Black Mesa Bar-B-Q will soon offer a grand moment of glory . Gabby magically and quickly finds herself head over heels in love with Allan , finding him worldly and intelligent , though to him , intelligence is " brains without purpose " . Squier's presence deflates the ego of Gabby's would be boyfriend Boze , who effectively delivers the film's defining comment when viewed in retrospect - " Everybody's entitled to their own way o ' thinking " . With a handful of films already to his credit , Humphrey Bogart finally gets his hands on a meaty role in the figure of Duke Mantee . By the time his gang makes it's way to Black Mesa , you know he's the man in charge . So does Gramp Maple , who's prior brushes with celebrity include Billy the Kid and Samuel Clemens . Though generally not taken seriously by his diner companions , he's vindicated by the appearance of the Duke - " You can't tell a killer except by his chin " . For his part , Bogey affects an odd posture , one that won't be seen again in any other film ; he bows his arms across the front of his body in an almost ape like stance giving added menace to his authority . Earlier , Mantee and his cohorts hijacked the vehicle of a wealthy businessman named Chisholm ( Paul Harvey ) . Representing industrializing America , he's everything his wife detests , hating herself for a loveless marriage and denouncing his timidity in the face of danger . As Allan and Gabby share a passionate conversation , director Archie Mayo poignantly frames their face to face encounter around the background features of Mrs . Chisholm , dramatizing the lost purpose and vitality of a woman who gave in to her family's wishes instead of her own . Ultimately , Allan Squier strikes on the one defining idea that will give his life some meaning and purpose , he will sign over his five thousand dollar life insurance policy to Gabby so she can use the proceeds to return to France to live out her artistic dream . To make it come true , Duke Mantee will have to kill Allan . Mantee has no qualms about the proposal , but has no personal quarrel with Allan and seems rather to almost enjoy his company . Squier must force the issue , so that " As long as I live , I'll be grateful to the Duke " . " The Petrified Forest " covers a lot of ground , and even manages to reflect on racial constructs in the exchange between the two black men in the film . Slim Thompson is Duke's driver , but a man in his own right freely challenging and offering advice to his boss . On the other hand , Chisholm's chauffeur Joseph is typecast as the subservient employee , who has to ask permission to have a drink when offered by Slim . The scene lasts only a few seconds , but long enough for the symbolism to jump out and grab the viewer . Having just viewed " The Petrified Forest " for the fourth time , I'm even more in awe now of the film's powerful story and the director's deft use of it's principals and supporting characters . There's not a wasted moment , and every scene seems to have a purpose , even if it's a rolling tumbleweed across the desert landscape . They just don't make them like that anymore . Bette Davis made her film debut in 1931 in " The Bad Sister " , a movie that also included Humphrey Bogart . The two would team up again an incredible five more times by 1939 , in order - " Three On A Match " , " The Petrified Forest " , " Marked Woman " , " Kid Galahad " , and " Dark Victory " . Davis was top billed each time over Bogey ; oddly Bogart usually wound up in supporting roles in most of his Warner Brothers films when teamed with fellow contract players Davis , James Cagney and Edward G . Robinson .
" You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view . "	I've now seen " To Kill A Mockingbird " about a half dozen times , and it didn't strike me until today's viewing how much of the story revolves around Scout and Jem , the children of the story's hero , Atticus Finch . Perhaps that's because the picture hooks us with it's courtroom drama and the overt issue of racial intolerance in 1930's America . Maybe it's because Gregory Peck is so brilliant in the role of the hero that it's easy to overlook all of the supporting characters . In any event , this is a strong and stirring film , I consider it must viewing for any serious fan of great cinema . It is simply perfect in it's execution , with character portrayals that are as real and endearing as any in film . Watching today , it helps to consider how important this movie was in breaking down racial barriers on the eve of the Civil Rights revolution in this country . It's not difficult to imagine lone , solitary heroes like Atticus Finch in far flung small towns of the South standing single minded against hatred and bigotry . The values instilled in his children are personified in the movie by young Jem , for whom the experience takes on a defining coming of age . Jem experiences first hand the fear of bigotry , yet with glowing pride comes to understand that his father is a true hero , not only accepted , but honored by the black community in his small town for showing courage and humanity in the face of overwhelming opposition . For her part , Scout ( Mary Badham ) shines in one of the story's most forceful scenes , facing down a veritable lynch mob by being nothing more than human , causing her father's adversaries outright shame and humiliation . One gets the feeling that perhaps Atticus himself learned a lesson that day . In accepting the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievemant Award in 1988 , Gregory Peck issued a challenge to the entertainment industry , one of ' elevating the quality of films and TV shows ' . Sadly , that challenge has gone largely unanswered , as movie makers go for larger and louder special effects , and an increasing appeal to the lowest common denominator . Fortunately , films like " To Kill A Mockingbird " live on to work their magic on succeeding generations who can appreciate and put into perspective the struggles of a nation coming to grips with equality for all . This one has been on my personal Top Ten list for a long time , and is in no clear danger of being replaced . It's one of the few movies I can revisit yearly and continue to take away meaning and importance time after time . Clearly recommended for one and all .
" You done it Pa , you done it . . . "	Utilizing the core story from the 1957 movie of the same name , James Mangold crafts a masterfully tense psychological Western that convinces this viewer that the genre isn't dead by a long shot . " 3 : 10 To Yuma " is one of those rare re-makes that surpasses the original by building on the themes presented there , while adding finely crafted layers to the story that help define it's characters , offering a glimpse inside the minds of the film's main protagonists . Those who dismiss the movie because of it's ending fail to consider what happened along the way , as events that occur and dialog among the characters offer many clues to Ben Wade's ( Russell Crowe ) ' sudden ' turn at the story's climax . Where the film differs substantially from the Glenn Ford / Van Heflin version is in it's intensity , not merely for the gun battles and action scenes in the remake , but in the way outlaw Wade and rancher Dan Evans ( Christian Bale ) employ a battle of wills to counter their respective foes . By comparison , the 1957 film is almost entirely laid back , with Wade's outlaw gang occupying a largely secondary position in the story . The addition of Evans ' son Will ( Logan Lerman ) to the core story proves important in developing the senior Evans ' obsessive resolve in proving his worth to himself and his family . Even when offered a fully reasonable way out from his mission , Evans sees it as his duty to respect himself first , and use that opportunity to teach his son a life lesson . For me , the turning point in the movie occurred when Dan Evans saves Wade from certain death at the coolie camp . Even though son Will later saw it merely as payback for Wade's role during the Apache ambush , something even more fundamental was going on with the outlaw's understanding of what makes his bodyguard tick . You catch a hint of it at the hotel room as Wade attempts to engage Evans in further conversation - " You mean we're still not friends ? " By the time Will implores Wade to hold back his men , you have a genuine sense that events are conspiring to force Wade to see this rancher in a new light . As Wade declines and asks why - Will : " Because you're not all bad " . Wade : " Yes I am " . But by this point , he's not . For those needing further insight into Wade's actions at the end of the story , I would refer to an early scene in the picture when Ben Wade killed one of his young outlaws when he failed to do a thorough job of inspecting the robbed payroll coach - " Tommy was weak , Tommy was stupid , Tommy's dead " . Tommy , I might add , also didn't follow his boss's orders . Therein lies the motivation for Wade's intemperate dismissal of Charlie Prince ( Ben Foster ) at the finale - Charlie didn't follow orders . He was told to stop shooting by Wade , and he didn't listen . I would still suggest strongly that Wade's admiration for Evans was more of a factor , but Charlie didn't help his own cause . Speaking of Foster , his was an excellent characterization of Wade's second in command , on the order of Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow , or Keith Richards ' Keith Richards . I also enjoyed Peter Fonda's interpretation of the Pinkerton bounty hunter , Byron McElroy . He seems to have aged nicely into a role suggestive of his late father , Henry Fonda , and all those great Westerns he appeared in . I also want to throw in a comment on the musical score as events headed to a showdown at Contention , highly reminiscent of , and sounding like an homage to the great spaghetti Westerns of the 1970's . I think Ennio Morricone would agree . For those still in doubt about the ending , thinking it just too difficult to consider Ben Wade siding with Dan Evans , perhaps I can counter with a plot point I found to be hard to imagine . How would a career outlaw be able to quote so many passages from the Bible after a single reading over three days ? That my friends , is truly unbelievable .
" Ah , ah , ah , now there your are , you've got to stop thinking in terms of fortune . "	Nearly forty years ago , I had the role of Kolenkhov in my high school's presentation of " You Can't Take It With You " , and it took all that time to get around to seeing the Oscar winning film today . Watching it brought back some great memories , along with a question . How is it that this film hasn't achieved the type of recognition accorded to " It's A Wonderful Life " , also directed by Frank Capra ? Both explore similar themes with stellar casts , and defined life's simple values against a backdrop of big business greed . One can only wonder . What's not hard to understand though is how quickly the Sycamore Family grabs you with their zany lifestyle under patriarch Grandpa Vanderhof ( Lionel Barrymore ) . He's clearly the voice of reason in the maelstrom of a New York City neighborhood in the shadow of Wall Street . He's also the conscience of a community that comes to rely on his status as the lone holdout against a major munitions manufacturer that wants to buy up the block for a new business enterprise . As daunting as that task sounds , it's the subtle and sometimes not so subtle subtext that comes across more forcefully in the day to day life of the Sycamore home . At any given moment , different members of the family take center stage , each with their own unique personalities precariously balanced above a basement filled with home made explosives . When the inevitable Fourth of July demonstration finally erupts , you've already been conditioned to accept it as just another day with Grandpa Vanderhof . Though most of the movie followed along the lines of the play as I remember it , there was a great additional scene in the park with Tony Kirby ( James Stewart ) and Alice Sycamore ( Jean Arthur ) where the local kids teach them how to do the ' Big Apple ' . As a couple , you just knew Alice and Tony were destined for each other , no matter what the script threw their way . And what a gold mine of supporting players ! Edward Arnold as the magnate Kirby , Mischa Auer as Russian ballet instructor Kolenkhov ( It steenks ! ) , Spring Byington , Dub Taylor , H . B . Warner and most surprising of all - Eddie Anderson as household servant Donald . He and Lillian Yarbo were generally afforded dignity in their roles as domestics , though there was an unfortunate ' boy ' reference thrown at Donald along the way . Even after all this time I was still able to pick off lines before they were spoken , and couldn't help recalling classmates that filled each role . It was especially a moving way to recall my best friend at the time who portrayed Grandpa Vanderhof ; he received standing ovations at each performance . I found myself wishing he were watching the movie with me , but he passed away a dozen years ago . That added another dimension to the harmonica duet , a scene that already had enough poignancy to elicit a couple of tears .
