Had to struggle to stay awake watching this movie	SPOILERS Embarrassingly bad movie about a lost couple , Michael & Margaret , and their little girl Debbie ending up in this creepy house with an even creepier care-taker Torgo . Torgo to his credit told the couple to stay away from the house because his Master don't want anyone there . But Michael and Margaret just ignored him and made themselves at home and even had Torgo help them move in . Torgo looked like he was recovering from a really bad LSD trip and when you saw him walk he would sway from side to side with his legs looking like they were suffering from a very severe case of elephantiasis . The Master , who has a striking resemblance to Frank Zappa , was at the time asleep , in a zombie-like trance , in his tomb with his six wives located somewhere outside the house . Torgo was very angry at the Master for having six wives while he had none and had his eye on the nice looking Margaret for his future mate . We see Torgo later trying to grope Margaret but his actions are so weird that it really looks like he just wanted to hold on to her in order for him not to lose his balance and fall on his face ending up breaking his head . When the Master finally awakes he finds Torgo out cold as if he were a corpse and after bringing him back to life he berates him for letting the strangers into his home . The Master also accuses Torgo of fooling around with his wives while he , as well as they , was asleep in the tomb . Later that night the Master gets the whole crazy crew together and the wives become enraged over Torgo letting Michael and the two women , Margaret and her little daughter Debbie into the house and want to have them all killed . But the Master's first wife only wants to have Michael killed and have the women , especially little Debbie , left alive . A fight breaks out between the wives over who should live and who should die of the three strangers but the Master settles to only kill Torgo for letting them in the house in the first place . Having Torgo tied down the Master then orders his wives to beat him to death . But it looks more like they were giving Torgo a total body massages instead of beating him and Torgo looked like he was really enjoying all of it . The Master then has Torgo's left hand blown off by touching some magic staff that he has and we then see Torgo , minus his left hand , running into the darkness never to be seen again in the movie . Having his # 1 wife tied to a poll for talking back to him the Master then proceeds to beat her to death . But the beating , like the one that Torgo got from the Master's wives , looked so harmless and phony that his wife must have died from laughing herself to death instead of the beating that the Master gave her . Meanwhile back at the house Michael and Margaret and little Debbie make a run for freedom in he dark desert but are caught by the Master and his wives before they get too far away . The movie ends with Michael replacing Torgo as the Master's care-taker and both Margaret and Debbie becoming his two new wives replacing wife # 1 ; Or let's just say two for the price of one if thats what it all meant ? What can be said about this movie that hasn't been said already . The two things I can add of what I noticed about " Manos the hands of fate " is that it was shot in color which was rare for a super low-budget , $20 , 000 . 00 , film like it was back in 1966 . As for the syrupy soundtrack it sounded like a music for a romantic or love story type film not the horrible horror movie that " Manos " was and is .
A hard act to follow	MAJOR SPOILERS The movie " Atom Age Vampire " really doesn't have anything to do with vampires at all which throws you off almost as soon as it starts . There's this gorgeous stripper Jeanette Moreneau , Susanne Loret , who's having trouble with her boyfriend sailor Pierre Mornot , Sergio Fantoni . Pierre is very critical of Jeanette taking her clothes off in public for a living . Walking out on the tearful Jeanette and taking the first ship out at sea Pierre has the distraught and suicidal Jeanette take off in her car and end up in a car smash-up with her gorgeous face hideously scared . It's then when in the hospital that Monique Riviere , Franca Parisi , pays Jeanette a visit offering her through the experiments of her lover as well as boss Professor Albar Levin , Alberto Lupo , to have her militated faced restored . Professor Albar had read of Jeanette's accident and want's to try out his new cell restoration serum , Durma # 28 , on the poor woman . Reluctant at first Jeanette goes along with both Albar and Monique's scheme and almost like magic withing days , after she was almost given up on by the two , Jeanette is as beautiful as even with Durma # 28 proving to be a complete success ! It's only later when the Durma # 28 starts to ware off , something that Albar never expected it to do , that the by now crazed professor turns into a Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde type personality . For reasons never explained Albar turns himself into , by locking himself into a cockpit-like device , a half-man half-ape like maniac . Going out at night the professor attacks and murders a number of young women and then again not really explained how in the film uses their , what I can only guess , pituitary and thyroid glands to extract a new batch of Durma # 28 . The serum is used by Albar on the decomposing Jeanette in order to bring her back to her full beauty . As you would expect all this attention towards Jeanette has Monique become jealous and it's then that Albar has her become , in extracting her natural Durma # 28 secretions , put away on ice , in the city mortuary , for good . It's later on in the movie when Pierre comes back that things start to unravel for Albar and his plans to make Jeanette his permanent property . Now fully restored , because of Albar's murderous efforts , and not decomposing anymore Jeanette tells Albar to take a hike since she's going back to her one and only love the handsome mariner Pierre Mornet . Feeling that he's been both humiliated and double-crossed , in all the great work he's done for her , by the ungrateful Jeanette Albar now not really wanting to live anymore goes on his last and final rampage . Albar turning again into an Apeman attacks a startled Pierre who , despite Albar's ape-like abilities , has no problem subduing the psycho . The end for the now helpless Albar comes in his greenhouse where he kept Jeanette hidden from the public . With even his loyal mute gardener / handyman Sacha , Roberto Bertea , letting him down by not hiding Albar from the police all he can do is wait for the enviable and with the enviable he finally snaps , or through metamorphosis , becomes normal again . The thing is that by him becoming normal Albar became dead at the same time .
Whatever Chuku want's Chuku gets !

These sessions are held in the basement of his antiques shop to bring him as well as his followers financial rewards in what ever business that their in . Worshiping this African Idol named Chuku Mottram has to provide it with monthly human sacrifices to keep his luck going . That resulted in him getting out of debt and becoming independently wealthy with his shop used as a front for his murderous activities . The local police are a bit suspicious of Mottram since he's suspected of being involved in two different murders of women who were known to him and ended up savagely mutilated , and in one case burned to a crisps , and found floating in the Thames River . With Chuku constantly needing new blood to be spilled to satisfy his gluttonous appetite Mottran comes up with a plan to do in his old and rich Aunt Louise , Edith Evens .

Mottran jumps into bed with her just as she wakes up , from the effects of all the booze she drank , making Dolly think that he spent the entire evening , and a good part of the morning , with her . The police lead by this tough talking and no BS guy Det . Sgt . Wall , Michael Jayston , feel that it was Mottram who murdered Aunt Louise ? How could that be ! Didn't the coroner determine that Aunt Louise was already dead before the stake , the so-called murder weapon was used to sacrifice , not kill , her by the insane Mottram ? With her death being the result of Mottran scaring her to death a fact that the police were totally unaware off ! The weak link in Mottram's chain of murders turned out to be his live-in protégée in his antique shop the naive and alcoholic prone Ronnie , Martin Potter .

At the the same time Ronnie gets up enough courage to smash to pieces Mottram's evil idol Chuku .

Beating him up and throwing Ronnie head-first through the store window with the police , headed by the rough and ready Det .

Wall's revolver to finally put the homicidal madman down .
Looney Tunes	SPOILERS " Paranoid " is a really weird movie about a fashion model Chloe , Jessica Alba , getting involved with a couple of nut-jobs in the little town of Davon on the quiet English coast . We also have Chloe getting harassed by some crazed stalker who's constantly calling her on her cell-phone and how he got Chloe's number , well you'll just have to stay to the end of the movie to find out if your still awake by then . Being set up by her boyfriend Ned , Gary Love , Chloe goes to Levens Hill Lodge in Davon for the weekend and ends up drunk and on drugs and when she comes too she finds out that all the guests at the lodge , except her , are gone . Chloe also finds that her boyfriend had more then just two timed her but that he was married to one of the guests that was with her at the lodge Eve , Gina Bellman , which hurt and greatly upset her . Stuck with nutty Stan , Lain Glen , and his burnt out wife Rachael or Ray , Jenne Tripplehorn , and Stan's creepy younger brother Gordon , Ewen Bremner , Chloe is trapped there with nowhere to go . Drugged and drunk Chloe is video-taped by Gordon having a good time with the trio and when she recovers she goes into the living room and finds a video-tape . Watching it on her TV Chole sees another party with not only Stan Gordon and Ray but also Ned with a girl drunk or doped up and partly naked . When Stan finds out that Chloe saw the tape he freaks out and in the end tries to have her murdered . I couldn't for the life of me figure out why Stan was so whacked out over a more or less harmless tape of him and his friends partying with the girl who wasn't a minor and didn't really seemed to be abused by anyone on the tape . We see her voluntarily take her clothes off and at one point on the tape she seems to have passed out . That was about the worst that happened to her and it wasn't brought out that she ended up dead injured raped or missing sometime after the tape was taken . Even if the worst did happened to her , she was found murdered all Stan had to do was destroy the tape and nobody would know if it ever existed , or if he knew or had anything to do with the girl on it ; but to kill Chloe for seeing it ! now that's crazy ! It may very well have been Stan's state of mind that was saturated with both drugs and booze over the years that may have given him this paranoid reaction and the burnt-out Ray and dopey Gordon in the end went along just to placate him . The two heroes in the movie " Paranoid " were really not what were used to seeing as heroes in films : Theresa , Mischa Barton , who was Stan and Ray's deaf mute and ping-pong playing 15 year-old daughter and Clive , Kevin Whately , a girl-watching weirdo who lived across the street from Chloe . Theresa drawing where Chloe is , the Levens Hill Lodge , and pasting a photo of her on the drawing sends it to the police . Clive who was watching Chloe with a pair of binoculars from his apartment across the street from her became alarmed when he didn't see her for days and then tracked her down to the Levens Hill Lodge where she was held hostage by Stan . Ned who supplied girls to Stan for parties and got his supply of coke from him in return got very nervous when Stan told him that Chloe had to be eliminated . In the end Ned told the police when they came to Stan's house looking for Chloe what was happening and led them to the cliffs to stop Stan and Gordon form killing her . We were told earlier in the movie that Stan was a big time rock musician a while back and I started to wonder if the heavy music did more damage to his brain then the heavy drugs that he was using in the movie . Stan also fancied himself as a big time philosopher and poet and me and those in the audience as well as those on the screen had trouble keeping a straight face and not cracking up whenever the so-called words of wisdom came flowing out of his mouth . Clive came to Chloe's rescue , together with the police , as Stan and Gordon tried to push a car with her locked up in the trunk down the cliff into the ocean . When Stan saw th cops all hell break loose as he told Gordon to distract them by not letting then hear Chloe's banging from inside the car-trunk . The not too bright Gordon dim-wittily banged against the trunk of the car like he was playing the bongo drums to drown out Choles screams ! Clive runs down and chases away both Stan and Gordon and prevents them from killing Chloe and as he's driving his car we hear the American Country & Western song " The Last Roundup " playing in the English countryside . The biggest surprise of all was saved for the end of the movie where we finally got to see who was pestering Chloe on the phone during the entire movie . That revelation only went to prove that the person wasn't who you thought he or she was but that the person was who you thought he or she wasn't .
Ridiculously muddled Black Sea thriller	( Some Spoilers ) Not to be taken seriously for a moment " Black Sea 213 " is so nutty that you have to like it even though it insults you sense of reality as well as intelligence . This arrogant and stuffed-up fashion photographer Gabe , Anthony Addabbo , gets the use of a Russian freighter to do his next big fashion shoot in the middle of the Black Sea . What he doesn't know is he and his troop of beautiful fashion models are being used as a cover for the ship's Captain Killick , Brion James , to smuggle high-tech weapons and a one billion dollar missile guidance system , the size of a briefcase , to an unknown world power . This is to take place off the port city of Yalta by loading the weapons on a submarine . The big mover in this deal is Dean , Timothy Bottoms , who was a fellow marine buddy of Gabe and now a big time arms smuggler who together with local Yalta gangster Pasha Lakovitz , Rubi Zack , set up the whole deal . Captain Killick who's being used to both Dean and Pasha's advantage and is to be knocked off after the deal with weapons is culminated has his own ideas to how things are to be done . Killick does in both Dean and Pasha leaving him as the only one to collect the big pay-off . Gabe who was thrown overboard and later gets back on deck together with his girlfriend model Ursula ( Jacki Lovell ) , who was also thrown overboard with him , starts a mutiny which has most of the girls gunned down . Captain Killick fleeing with his reluctant squeeze Isla ( Irina Zatolokina ) on a motorized life boat with the billion dollar missile system , packed in crate # 213 , on board expects to be picked up by the sub and get just what's coming to him . Killick has the freighter bobby-trapped to be blown to bits by a bomb he planted in it's Hull , where all the weapons and explosives are being kept , but unknown to Killick someone switched the bomb and he's the one to get blasted not those on the freighter . Everyone in the cast seemed to be either on downers or suffering from a severe case of sleep deprivation as they have trouble staying awake during the movie . Timothy Bottoms was so out of it that even when he was taking a shower with one of the gorgeous and busty models he seemed totally unconscious and unaware of the enviable , to those of us watching , position that he was in not even giving her a second look . Both Gabe and Ursula were totally unconvincing and came across as if they were forced to be in the film and wanted to get out of it even if it killed them , or they were killed off by the director , to do it . Only Brion James as Captain Killick seemed to have a good time being in " Black Sea 213 " and was about the only person who kept you , as well as the cast , from conking out and sleeping through the movie .

Farrady's part has Numar faint dead in his tracks . It later turns out that Numar somehow was possessed by Ra Ha Tet's spirit or soul who took over his body and caused him to age , at the rate of 500 years per hour , to become himself a 3 , 000 year-old mummy . The movie has Numar dressed in what looks like a pair of pajamas slinking around Ra Ha Tet's tomb and it's surroundings attacking and sucking out the blood in order to survive , like a vampire , of anyone man or animal that he comes in contact with . This blood-sucking adventure by Numar , with him later losing his right arm , goes on for some time until the by now crazed Quentin trying to find the entrance , you in fact thought that he already found it , to Ra Ha Tet's tomb get's himself killed is an indoor rock slide .

There's no place for him to go but down	Filmed along Yugoslavia's's Adriatic coast " Potrait of Terror " has some breathtaking scenic photography but it's story is just another madman on the lose movie . This time involving a killer who's out to get an expensive Titian painting that belonged to the 19th century Italian aristocratic Sordi family . Tony a descendant of the famed Sordi's is a wannabe great artist who feels that his great artistic talent is not appreciated by the local art connoisseurs who feel that he's anything but great . Tony's Uncle Hugo has a very valuable Titian painting in his mansion and he feels that if he gets a hold of it the painting would somehow give him magical powers . Those powers would greatly improve his painting and the appreciation of his work by the art-loving public . Tony also thinks that the possession of the Titian would have Vera come back to him after she left the overbearing and obnoxious artist for her now fiancé Danny . In steps this Professor Mauricio Aronie from the US who seems to have some connection with Tony in wanting the Titian and sure enough the painting is stolen from Uncle Hugo's place with Hugo ending up dead . It's obvious from the start that Aronie is the killer but what puzzles the police is how he got the key to get into Uncle Hugo's mansion ? since it's , and the medieval lock that it opens , a one of a kind ! Later Aronie finds out that the painting that he stole was not an original Titian but a fake and takes it out on Tony for tricking him . After a violent confrontation with Tony , off camera , we assume that he was murdered , like his Uncle Hugo , by the wild and crazy guy professor . Aronie now starts to track down Tony's friends who may know where the real Titian painting is including his now , after Vera , girlfriend Linda a local nightclub singer . Getting Linda to meet him outside a church Aronie takes out what looks like a girl scout , it looked like it couldn't penetrate the skin of an apple , pocket knife and kills Linda throwing her body in the Adriatic Sea . It later turns out that Linda did have the real Titian , that the missing Tony gave her , and gave it to Charlie the bartender at the nightclub that she worked at for safe-keeping . With the police finding Linda's body under the waves they now cut off all avenues of escape for the now on the loose murderer Aronie who's already responsible for some two or possibly three murders already and may well add a few more to his body count if he's not captured very soon . The surprise ending saved " Portrait of Terror " from being a total " Bomb " and at least made suffering through it up until the surprise ending worth while . With the killer trapped on top of a church bell tower as the police close in on him much like in the ending in Orson Wells ' 1946 Film-Noir thriller " The Stranger " .
Your kidney is now pumping away in a woman in Luxemberg ! She would have died without it !	SPOILERS Very uneven in parts but still unique and interesting movie about involuntary organ donations on the part of some very disturbed persons . Who feel that their the modern versions of Robin Hood , taking from the healthy and giving to the sickly . Movie stuntman Billy Castal , Jeff Wincott , is out with his friends at the local bar looking to have a good time . Seeing this knock-out of a woman Angel , Christna Cox , Billy makes a play for her , after he floored a patron who tried to violently grab her . Like magic she takes him up to her hotel-room gives the somewhat startled young man a drink and all at once Billy passes out cold . Awakening from his sleep Billy finds out to his shock that hes been surgically opened up with his right kidney removed ! At the hospital the doctor Lucy Flynn , Machelle Johnson , treating Billy says that whoever did the operation on him know what he , or she , was doing . it's was also found out that whoever did this outrage wore contacts , a lens was found stuck under Billy's stitches , and worked in a prison since the stitches that sew Billy up are only used by doctors in state penitentiaries . The film has a lot of false suspects to who actually did this hatched job on Billy which stretches it's plot really thin and makes Billy into an almost paranoid schizophrenic . Billy attacks anyone he as much as suspects was responsible for his unwanted and illegal operation . Whoever did in Billy later does the same thing to former collage basketball player Daryl Chambers , Falconer Abraham . Daryl being picked up at a bar by Sue , Ellen Dublin , who like Angle worked for the criminal organ donor outfit , gets him knocked out , with a glass of spiked champaign , in her motel room . Sue has a surgeon and staff wheel in an operating unite and do a job on Daryl by removing one of Daryl's pink and healthy kidneys . Unlike Billy Daryl has a very weak heart and never survived the operation . Billy tracks down one of the people that operated on him at the lab that handled a blood test he , like Daryl , took nurse Talia Green , Karen Waddell . Talia takes off like a house on fire at just the sight of Billy . Going to Talia's home Billy finds that she's dead from a drug overdose that's later determined by the police to have been forced on her . It now becomes obvious that whoever's responsible for Daryl's and Talia's murder and Billy's stolen kidney is working at the local hospital and that's where things start to really get mixed up . Billy , get involved in some crazy and mind-boggling shell game as to who in the hospital is responsible for these outrageous crimes that end with Billy , now at gunpoint , having the killer demand that he donate his second kidney ! The kidney is for some bright and deserving 16 year-old Mexican boy who desperately needs it ! All right for a straight to video movie " The Donor " does get a little carried away with itself by just trying to be too slick in trying to keep it's audience guessing to who the killer / operator is . Making everyone in it , with the exception of victims Billy & Daryl , suspects that takes a lot away from the real villain when you finally get to realize just who he , or she , really is .
The Psycho Next Door	( There are Spoilers ) Casing out the Michaels ' residence Dan Summer , using the name Brain Heartwell , plans to move in but there's only one problem . The spare room for rent is already occupied . Being a guy who doesn't take no for an answer Dan fixes that pressing problem by murdering not only the occupant of the room Carrie but her boyfriend Daryl as well ! Having just been released from the Greely Mental Institution Dan , taking the name of his psychiatrist , wants only one thing in life : Get even with the person who drove his dad , a former Teacher of the Year , to kill himself ! That person just happens to be Jessica Michaels ! The person whom he's about to rent a room from in her house ! Jessica as a young girl was inappropriately touched by her drama teacher Mr . Summer who tried to get into her pants or dress . Mr . Summer being indited for sexual molestation and fired from his job hanged himself on Christmas Eve with his nine-year-old son Dan discovering his body ! Dan having it in for Jessica all these years is now in the position to finally get even . SPOILER ALERTWhat Dan will later find out is that his " innocent " dad was a serial rapist with one of his victims being his daughter , and Dan's sister , Andrea . Dan in his deteriorating mental state loses focus on what he's supposed to do by murdering some half dozen persons before he finally get around to his original intended victim Jessica Michaels . A I was watching the movie I kept wondering just how this very obvious off-the-wall and dangerous psycho was released , if in fact he escaped , from the Greely Mental Institution in the first place ! Dan was anything but smart in what he did where you can spot his weirdo-like insanity as soon as you laid eyes on him . So why didn't the psychiatrist see that at the institution that he was committed to ! In fact it seemed like nobody in the movie except Jessica's adopted daughter Laura had even an inkling to how crazy Dan was . And Laura was just your normal high-school teenager not a certified or licensed doctor or psychiatrist ! The film tries , with very little success , to follow the usual pattern of the psycho pretending to be normal storyline except that Dan is anything but normal in the movie . Murdering persons like Jessica's dad Mr . Michaels who actually liked the crazy nut as well as his girlfriend , like him a former mental patient , Rachael who , despite treating her like dirt , worshiped the ground he walked on didn't help Dan either . All that did was just throw suspicion on Dan to what a loose nut and potential psycho killer he really was .
May be a little too deep for the audience that it's targeting	SPOILERS You don't really get what you expected watching " Terror of the Bloodhunters . Instead of lots of tall buxom and beautiful Amazon-looking women you get , almost throughout the entire movie , deep philosophical exchanges between the leading cast members . The story is built around the Devil's Island Commandant , Niles Andrus , and his spoiled rotten and bored daughter Marlene , Dorothy Haney . Marlene is sick and tired of being confined , like the guards and inmates , to the Devil's Island penal colony and wants to get out any way that she can even in a pine box . It's when a new group of inmates are sent to the Island that Marlene sees her chance to make a clean getaway . Big time philosophy writer and humanist Steve Duval , Robert Clarke , has been sent to that God forsaken island because of his ideas , thought crimes , about universal freedom as well as the human condition not because of any real crimes that he committed . The commandant wanting his daughter Marlene to marry his top-kick or the captain at the island prison the very effective and by the books Whorf ( Robert Christopher ) , who in twelve years running the place had no one escape , also want's Marlene to learn to paint with the multi-talented Duval giving her lessons . Marlene together with Duval and fellow inmate and humanist , another thought crime prisoner , Dione ( William White ) make their escape the very next evening on the Commandant's personal riverboat . It's later when the trio realize that their plan to make it to safety in Brazil is about to fall apart they go on foot thought the dense snake jaguar and headhunter infested Amazon jungle . It's there where they together with the pursuing Captain Whorf and his sniveling sidekick Cabot , Steve Conte , are enlightened to what life really means and the real purpose of man being put , by a powerful but benevolent creator , on earth ; To become as whole kind and perfect and the creator who put him there . In short man is to become a true human being in his feeling not only towards his fellow man , in treating him as he would want to be treated himself , but in forsaking the greedy materialistic and selfish ideas that's been put in his head , by those who follow and worship those false idols , since he was born . We do get to see a number of sexy women looking more like they work as secretaries in a Wall Street and Madison Av office then jungle natives doing some kind of hula hula dance . This while the native women are sacrificing a member of their tribe , who looks totally out of it , to their brutal and blood-thirsty jungle God . There's also a sequence where Whorf and Cabot are captured by a group of native headhunters and Duval together with Marlene , Dione was earlier killed by a attacking black jaguar , coming to their rescuer before they get their heads shrunk . All this of course is just window dressing to the real issues that the movie addresses : Man lifting himself up as well as those around him . This in spite of all the evil that he's both confronted with and controlled by . It's that hidden meaning in the movie " Terror of the Headhunters " that's by far the reason that it's not only a notch or two , but miles , above the average exploitation flick of the 1950's and 1960's . It's also the reason that the film hits home with its unsuspecting , who expected a lot less , and surprised audience .

Hack slowly working his way into the terrorists hideout , an abandoned bean factory , takes out all the bad guys leaving only him and Abdul to duke it out at the conclusion of the movie . Frank Stallone who's not as well known and popular as his famous older brother action hero Sylvester is effective in the fight scenes that he's in and his diction and command of the English language is much better then that of Sly's . The movie " Terror in Beverly Hills " is only just average with nothing that you haven't seen before in that type of film . What I found really interesting in the movie was the acting of Careron Mitchell as the L . A police Captain Stills who was on the verge of having a breakdown . Not just from the stress of the terrorists kidnapping and threatening to murder Margaret but how he was consistently harassed by the local TV news anchorman and his film crew all throughout the movie . Those jerks were a bigger danger to the presidents daughter as well as the police and government authorities , not to mention Hack , risking their lives to save her then even the terrorists were !
A Story Must Be Told !	SPOILERS Obviously a self-portrait of director Edward D . Wood Jr . strange life in and out of Hollywood . With Wood playing the title character in the movie Glen / Glenda . Originally titled " I led 2 Lives " . The movie starts with Bela Lugosi sitting in a laboratory and telling the theater audience about the mysteries of nature and creation as well as life and death and that nature , as perfect as it is , also makes mistakes . Mixing some chemicals Bela gets what looks like a full head on a mug after you pored a bottle of beer in it and his eyes light up and he says triumphantly " A life has begun ! " Then we see a big city and as the camera focuses in on a room where there's the body of a woman who committed suicide we hear Bela , off camera , sadly says " A life is ended " . It turns out that the dead woman is a transvestite who was arrested four times for wearing womens clothing and couldn't take being arrested anymore . Since as he wrote in his suicide note " That he'd rather be dead in womens cloths then have to live without wearing them " . Police inspector Warren , Lyle Talbot , who handled the case of the transvestite was so shook up over it that a few days later he went to a psychiatrist Dr . Alton , Timothy Farrell , just to settle down his nerves from seeing what he did . Dr . Alton tells Inspector Warren a long story about someone that he treated recently who had the same problem that the unfortunate transvestite had but with a happy ending . Glen , Ed Wood , is a man engaged to Babara , Dolores Fuller , but has a deep secret that he's afraid that if he told her it would destroy their relationship and he would lose her . Glen seems to be more in love with Barbara's angora sweater then he is with her . Dr Alton goes on to explain how Glen is a transvestite and what he does to satisfy his yearnings is to wear womens cloths . Dr . Alton goes on saying that to cure Glen of his obsession was for Barbara to except Glen for what he is after Glen confessed to her . Barbara , after taking a few minutes to absorb all that Glen told her tells Glen " I don't understand all of this but maybe together we can work it out " . We see Dr . Alton telling this story to Inspector Warren in a long weird surrealistic like strip show . We see women appearing on screen in all sorts of dress and undress scenes as well as Bela Lugosi popping up every now and then , mostly off camera . Bela Logosi keeps the audience entertained with saying things like " A story must be told " and " Pull the string " and for some reason that I can't figure out we see a herd of stampeding wild buffalo's in the background . Lugosi starts to get even more ridiculous as the movie rolls on with sayings that make no sense at all in light of the story that were seeing like " Dragon tell me , do you eat little boys and puppy dogs tails and big fat snails ? " . So after Dr . Alton's treatment Glen was completely cured of being Glenda by transferring Glenda , Glen's alter-ego , to Barbara but most of all having Barbara except Glen for what he is , a transvestite . With Barbara allowing Glen to wear her cloths both her and Glen can now live happily ever after . As the movie draws to a close Dr . Alton and almost in cadence Bela Lugosi end the it saying sadly that there are other transvestites like Glen who's stories don't have that same happy ending ; and just how many more are there ? just how many more are there ? What can one say after seeing a movie like this ! your left speechless . You have to give Ed Wood credit for not only making " Glen or Glenda " as well as staring in it with an added attraction at the conclusion of the film of the then , in 1952-53 , sensational story about the Christine Jorgesen sex-change operation , that was making headline news all over the world . The biggest surprise of all in regard to the movie is how on earth did Wood ever get it passed the ultra-prudish Hayes Commission back in 1953 ? That in itself ranks as one of the great accomplishments in motion picture history .
You took a bullet for the man . Nobody can ask for more then that !	MAJOR SPOILERS With his second term coming to an end as the President , Jack Scalia , is about to give his farewell address to a overflow and cheering crowd in the nation's capital tragedy strikes . As fate would have it he never made it to the podium to give his speech . As the assassin , with a forged journalist badge , pops out of the crowd and gets off a shot the President's personal Secret Service man Alex Thomas ( Cuba Goodling Jr ) , who's job it is to guard him with his life , sticks out his hand and the bullet hits and ricochets off it . This courageous act on Agent Thomas ' part causes the assassin's bullet , that would have missed , to hit the president in the chest leaving him mortally wounded . The assassin Lewis Detimore , Patrick Treadway , is killed on the spot by Agent Thomas and a number of other Secret Service agents before he can get off a second shot that may well had hit the First Lady , Anne Archer , and killed her as well . At first the killer is thought to be your average lone nut assassin with the case of the murdered president solved before the story hit the morning papers . Not for a moment believing the official story nosy and hot-shot Washington Inlander reporter Kate Crawford , Angle Harmon , smelled a big scoop and went after it . Uncovering the dead assassin's background Kate soon realizes that Detimore who was dying of cancer was in fact a Lee Harvey Oswald-like pasty planted at the scene to take the heat off those who really had the president done in . Getting in touch with a now dead drunk and guilt-ridden Agent Thomas , over his inability of not saving the president's life , Kate tries to get him to realize that there's more to the president's murder then what meets the eye or makes the 6 : 00 O'Clock Evening News . It's not Kate who convinces Thomas but a number of operatives , in the president's assassination , who soon end up dead in their trying to murder both him and Kate in order to keep their mouths shut ! Your basic conspiracy movie that has both Agent Thomas and reporter Kate Crawford in the both gun and bomb sights of those who did in the President of the United States . As it becomes more and more obvious to the American public , through Kate's reporting , that the deceased assassin , Lewis Detimore , didn't act alone Secret Service Chief Vaughn Stevens , James Woods , makes the uncovering of who was behind the president's murder top priority . You soon begin to realize that the top priority that Stephens has in mind is really to cover his and is agency's a in not preventing the assassination then in finding out who actually committed it ! Not at first really knowing it Agent Thomas had , in trying to cover up his beloved president's secret life , already solved who was the person responsible and the reason behind the murder the president ! But as it later tuned out Thomas was either too naive or unmotivated , in not consciously wanting to believe who had the president killed , that he completely overlooked it ! SPOILER ALERT The shocking truth , after about a dozen people end up getting killed in the film , to who set up the president and who in fact was the brains behind his murder really isn't that shocking at all . Having stepped on a number of powerful peoples toes during his tenure as the President of the United States those who wanted to do the President in not only had the means in doing it but also very personal reasons for having it done ! And what both Agent Thomas and reporter Kate Crawford were soon to find out , to their utter shock and frustration , is that these very powerful people were too far up the totem pole , in the Washington D . C political establishment , to ever be brought to justice for doing it !
For Granted ! For Granted ! In Science nothing is taken For Granted !	( There are Spoilers ) John Carradine in one of his many mad scientist roles as the crazed Dr . Charles Conway who's obsessed with finding the elusive secret of the legendary Fountain of Youth . Getting people to be patients at his secret medical clinic deep in the woods and miles from civilization Dr . Conway plans to experiment with them to make his subjects perpetually young like the portrait of Doren Gray . In the end he turns them into horrible and deformed mutants cursed to live forever in a cloistered sanitarium , like leapers . Never to see the light of day because of their shocking deformities that he inflicted on them . One evening an escaped convict Mark Huston , Myron Healey , is caught snooping around Dr . Conway's residence by his hulking and trusted servant Lobo , Tor Johnson . Dr . Conway sees the perfect specimen for his youth experiments with Huston in no position to run and go to the police for help since he himself is wanted for murder . Dr . Conway also has a number of other people at his place one of them Harry Jedrow , Harry Fleer , who's suffering from what the good doctor did to him by being in a totally comatose state . It's Jedrow who in the end spells the doom of Dr . Conway and his insane experiments by having his sister , whom he wasn't supposed to have , insist on having him released . This lead Dr . Conway to get Lobo to bury the poor man alive who was later rescued by Huston when Lobo took a lunch break , the big guy gotta eat , from shoveling dirt over Jedrow's coffin . Making a play for one of his patient's the beautiful Grace Thomas , Allison Hayes , has Dr . Conway's assistant the former 1946 Miss America Marilyn Buferd playing Dr . Sharon Gilchrist mad as hell and not about to take Dr . Conway's two-timing her anymore insisting that he use Miss . Thomas in his next experiment . Hoping that it will be as unsuccessful as the one he just had with Natalie Anders , Sally Todd a former Playboy Centerfold , who's face ended up looking like an over-baked pizza with extra cheese . As usual Dr . Conway's plan to bring eternal youth into the world is doomed to failure since the magical 17th gland , that looks like a pickled jalapeño pepper , that's supposed to bring on the miracle of eternal youth only makes his subjects freeze in time looking like a cross between the Munchkins in the Wizard of Oz and Lon Cheney Jr in his role as the hairy Wolf Man . With Huston now throwing off his cover and revealing himself to be police Let . , not wanted escaped murderer , Mark Huston everything starts to unravel for Dr . Conway . Huston and fellow patient Danny Green , Authur Batanides , overpower the brutish Lobo with Danny losing his life in the process and the zombie-like Jedrow coming back from the grave to pay Dr . Conway back , in spades , for everything he did to him over the years . Average 1950's horror movie with the so-called brilliant Dr . Conway flopping in every one of his experiments that had you , and the movie audience , wonder what was so brilliant about the crazy and arrogant kook in the first place . Tor Johnson's Lobo for once does have a few lines of dialog , which is very rare for him , notably the movies most quoted and remembered saying " Time Fahh Go Ta Bed " .
Hell On Earth	SPOILERS The dynamic Mister " D " , Lon Cheney Jr . is having serious problems in his underground domain with the population increasing and his real estate holding staying the same a major housing shortage has developed . Mr " D " could have come to the point right away in the movie about how to alleviate this nuisance but for the sake of the movie audience he padded the film with three episodes that really have nothing to do with his attempt to increase his land holdings . Getting a new tenant to his apartment complex , Satanya , who killed herself after her lover left her Mr . " D " gives her a chance to redeem herself by going upstairs and getting people to do things that would land them as new tenants down here with Mister " D " .

She predicted that he'll go on a trip to Egypt and later he wins a free ticket to go there and that he'll meet a man with a deep scar just before he dies Later John sees a man with a scar on his hand , banging on the phone booth , as he's trying to get help by calling his doctor as well as the police to prevent him being murdered . With nobody coming to his aid John then goes back to see Madame Germaine and plans to kill her before she kills him . After stabbing Madame Germaine and then pushing her down a railing John goes to see if she's alive but as he looks up he sees a statue of Madame Germaine , that was loosen when the railing broke , fall on him and crushes him to death . When the police find John's body they find that only he was killed and there was no Madame Germaine and the house that he was killed in was empty and condemned . All three people in these episodes ended up downstairs with a little help from Satanya by planting items for them to help them get there , Mister " D " ' s housing complex , somewhat faster . Back to the pit of fire John and Satanya together again are told by Mr . " D " that he has something for them to bring to the surface and give to the world powers to play with : The formula to build a 500 megaton nuclear bomb ! With that we see the world explode in a mushroom cloud and with it getting as hot up there as it's down here with Mr . " D " . With that Mr . " D " gets to control both upstairs and downstairs of the earth and his pressing housing problems are finally over . Those three interesting but totally unrelated stories were in all probability put into the movie to make " Devil's Messenger " a full-length motion picture . Without them the film would have been about as long as a Pespi commercial .
I have created a Monster ! May God forgive me	( Some Spoilers ) Having discovered the miracle of life through the process of blood De-coagulation Dr . Francis Flegg , John Litel , made the mistake of bringing back to life his first subject the brilliant , but convicted murderer , hematologist Doctor Maurice Xavier , Humphrey Bogart . Feeling that he's much too valuable a person to be taken from the world of science despite his criminal record . After being executed for murder in the electric chair at Sing Sing Dr .

I don't know how he did it YETI did .	SPOILERS Outrageously campy film about the " Yeti " or " Abominable Snowman " of the Himilayias with the creature looking like a giant Gabby Hayes or Jed Clampet of the " Beverly Hillbillies " . The creature goes around in a tight fur-lined jumpsuit tip toeing through the tulips as if trying not to wake up anyone in the movie or in the audience who may have fallen asleep watching . The creature was found by Dr . Frank Parrish's , Paul Langton , expedition that began in the town of Sherka at the foot of the mighty Himilayian Mountains . Dr . Perrish was going up the snow capped mountains to study plants and flowers , Dr . Parrish is a botanist , only to have his expedition taken over by a mutiny lead by his Sherka guide Subra , Teru Shimada , who's woman was kidnapped by a local Yeti in order to get her back . This leads to the expedition finding a cave high up on the mountain range where the Yeti and his family lives . Finding himself surrounded the Yeti starts a violent cave-in by pulling rocks out of their place killing his mate and offspring and knocking himself out . The Yeti ends up being captured by Dr . Parrish and his Sherka mountain climbers ; and who said that Yati's are supposed to be smart . Brought back some 10 , 000 miles to L . A the local authorities are more interested in the Yeti's immigration status then it's value to science . As their bickering with Dr . Parrish it escapes from an ice-box that it was caged in and goes out killing people on the streets of L . A . You would think that such a major find on Dr . Parrish's part would draw the attention of the entire scientific and anthropological world but in the movie that didn't even raise a stir in those two communities . With almost nobody showing up at the L . A airport to see the " Find of the Century " . The local as well as world media also seemed to be out to lunch or reporting on the latest gossip news , from TV and Movieland , to bother reporting about this historic find . On the loose and in the sewers , it felt more like home for the Yeti there , it terrorizes the city with the police hot on it's tail . Cornered in the sewer system the cops shoot , I don't know if they killed it or not , the Yeti and with that the movie ends . Campy and unintentionally funny film thats worth a look for bad movie fans who won't be disappointed and may even get a few good laughs out of it . The Yeti is so ridicules that every time you see it come on the screen you just can't help cracking up . the Yeti in the film " The Snow Creature " is about as scary as the Three Stooges and almost as funny .
Why Why don't they Understand !	SPOILERS Not defending himself or proclaiming his innocence at his trial for manslaughter young Jimmy Wilson , Robert Lowell , is asked by the judge , Edward Earl , if he has anything to say before he mets out justice . With tears in his eyes Jimmy opens his mouth for the first time as he turns to the spectators and reporters , including his morn & dad , as says " I accuse my parents " for whatever crimes that I've committed . Stunned with disbelief we get the real low down to what caused Jimmy to turn out the way that he did a an hour long flashback that takes up almost the entire film . Hollywoods attempt to explain juvenile crime back in the 1940's is no where as good as the films that came out of that town ten years later on the same subject like " Blackboard Jungle " and " Reble Without a Cause " in 1955 and the very underrated " Dino " in 1957 . Still the movie is nowhere as bad as it's been made out to be over the years by it's many critics and detractors . Jimmy was a very good student in high school and later had a good job selling shoes at a local loafer store in the neighborhood but his home life was a total wreck . Both his parents Mr . & Mrs . Wilson , John Milljan & Vivienne Osborne , never had any time for Jimmy with his mom an alcoholic and his dad never at home and always at some gambling den losing his money or carousing around at night looking for " action " . Jimmy's troubles started when he met at the shoe store young an pretty Kitty Reed , Mary Beth Hughes , who was buying a pair of shoes from him and fell in love with her . Kitty working at " The Paradise " nightclub as the top act also fell for the sweet and innocent Jimmy . Her boss nightclub owner and gangster Charles Blake , George Meeker , who was also in love with Kitty became very resentful of the young man and planned to use him , knowing that he'll do anything to be close to Kitty , as a pasty in his crime operations . Ferrying stolen cash for the Blake Mob Jimmy hit's it big when he's asked to be a driver in a heist , that Jimmy had no idea about , at a warehouse robbery that Blake is planing . The robbery goes bad with an night watchman getting shot and killed by the Blake Gang . Even worse Blake has Kitty break off her romance with Jimmy telling her she'll never sing , or breath , again if she doesn't . Heartbroken and a fugitive from the law Jimmy is out on the lamb alone hungry and broke when he comes upon a diner and , with a gun in his pocket , plans to rob it ; it's here where fate steps in and Jimmy's life turns around for the better . Al , George Llyod , the short order cook and owner notices that Jimmy is a good boy who ended up with the wrong crowd as well as his intentions of robbing him . In an angelically kind and simple way Al talks Jimmy out of doing what he's got on his mind . Al not only shows Jimmy the kindness love and understanding that his parents failed to show him all these years . Letting Jimmy live and work with him , Jimmy has a place to stay at the back of the diner , he for the first time finds the parental guidance that he needed . Later Jimmy comes to the conclusion , together with Al , that he'll have to come back home to face the music for what he did . Going to Blake's office , after he called the police to tell them he'll be there to turn himself in , Jimmy and Blake get into a violent struggle and Blake gets shot with his own gun . With the flashback over the judge gives Jimmy a second chance and gives him two years probation , for killing Blake and his involvement in the warehouse robbery / murder . The movie ends with Jimmy together with his girlfriend Kitty and both his parents at last coming to their senses and finally realizing the trouble that they caused for there son by ignoring , and not understanding , his feelings and thus having him end up the way that he did . But thanks to Al and Kitty Jimmy has redeemed himself and paid for his crimes and is ready to go out and face the world a free man in both mind and body .
Always wear Black	SPOILERS Not being up to take over and run his father's vast real-estate and business empire 19 year-old Jack Lyne , Jonathan Penner , is shocked to find out that his widowed mom Helen , Jacqueline Bisset , is planning to marry his hated and sleazy Uncle Carl , Jamey Sheridan . Doing nothing but getting smashed , with booze drugs and fists , Jack drops into one of his father's bars . While getting a load off his mind in the restroom Jack hears someone , on the other side of the stall , tell him that it was his Uncle Carl who really did his father in and made it look like a heart attack . Running out and checking everyones shoes , thats the only way he can identify the person who gave him the shocking news , Jack is beat up and thrown out by the bartender and a number of outraged customers . it seems obvious from the make of the shoes that the person who told Jack about his Uncle Carl's treachery is non-other then the family lawyer and his late dad's good friend Sol Hirsh , Philip Baker Hall . At a party at Hirsh's place that night , after having some hot action with Hirsh's unstable and dog food eating daughter Julie ( Mary-Louise Parker ) , Jack again sees written on a mirror , obviously by Sol , that Carl murdered his father and " what is he waiting for " ! It turns out that Carl is also at the party and so is Jack's mother where their to announce their upcoming engagement and marriage . Jack who's recovering from a sever mental breakdown want's to stop the marriage but doesn't feel that killing Carl is worth spending is entire life behind bars . On the other hand Carl , in having Jack murdered , does and is not at all planning to pay the price of his freedom for killing him and plans to make Jack's death look like an accident or robbery . The movie is a jumble of mistakes with Carl having these two creeps Bradbury & Brautigan , Randell Batikoff & Norma Needus , plan to whack Jack but things get a little complicated when Julie joins in . Jack calling for a cab to take Julie home with Brautigan's cell phone dials Sol's home and get's Uncle Carl instead . Not waiting for Jack to say anything and thinking that it's Brautigan , his cell phone number came up on the caller I . D , who's calling Carl tells Jack to whack Julie as well as himself . This tips Jack off that the two are not at all interested in Mexican food , which they were supposed to pick up , but are hired by Uncle Carl to put a bullet in his head . It turns out that Jack's fathers good friend and what seems to be his Guardian Angel Satch , Jonathan Banks , had these two crooked cops , Tony & Lobo , come to Jack's rescue knocking off both Bardbury & Brautigan before they could do Jack in . Later somehow , it's never explained in the movie , they seemed to have knocked off Julie even though she earlier left the car and the two would-be killers never as much as got out of their car seats ? Carl now greatly impressed with Jack ability to keep from getting killed by his hoods plans to get him in his friend's , and co-conspirator , Bruce , Maury Chaykin , " Pleasure Dome " nightclub to talk things over a few drinks . Setting Jack up with a spiked bottle of champaign and a hit-man , Jeff Bowser , if he felt like staying off the sauce that evening . As usual like everything else in the movie things get screwed up when Helen shows up , dressed all in black , for the party . Slow and boring movie that has to do with a number of off-the-wall characters who by the time it's over Jack is left dying and Carl and Jack's mother Helen who were supposed to be married are instead to be buried in the now very crowded Lyne family plot .
A Fever in the Blood	SPOILERS Deep psychological suspense / drama set in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn with a murder of a landlord . That later escalates into a world of insanity as well as the unknown , for one of the tenant's in the building . Sidney Miskowitz , Sandor Tecsy , is found murdered in his apartment one late evening just hours before Sidney has a bitter argument with one of his tenants Leonard Wooley , Jon Tracy . It's later thought by the police and almost everyone else in the building that Wooley is Sidney's killer . One of the tenants in the building art teacher Nick Parker , Henry Thomas , was a witness to the fight between Sidney and Wooley and is later called by the police as their star witness in the murder . At first you think your watching a murder / police drama until Nick goes upstairs to talk to his new neighbor Will , David O'Hera . It's then that things really start to get weird . Asking Will , the night of the murder , that he's disturbing Nick in doing his work , by making load noises , Will lets Nick have it about it being none of his business to what he's doing and almost throws him out of his apartment . Later that morning when the police are called to investigate Sidney's murder Nick tells NYPD Det . Glass , Bill Duke , about Will living upstairs and being a possible suspect and he's shocked to find that Will doesn't live there and In fact the upstairs apartment is empty ! You then start to realize that this Will may just be a figment of Nicks imagination . We keep seeing Nick go upstairs and talk to Will , who supposedly is not there , and Will comes across as a man totally out of touch with reality . Will feeling that the Nazis are in control of the world and that the ancient Gnostics are the real power behind every government on earth . This makes Nick , like those of us watching , feel that this guy is a can or two short of a six-pack when it comes to his mental reasoning . As the movie goes on it becomes apparent that Nick is suffering from some kind of breakdown but what exactly is causing it ? Later Mrs . Miskowitz , Sidney's 80 year-old mom , is also found dead by Nick . Sometime later Nick looks out of his window and sees Will leaving the apartment with a duffel bag . Nick is now certain that he must have murdered Mrs . Miskowitz , as well as her son Sidney , and is trying to escape . Quickly following Will onto the subway Nick Confronts Will between cars and ends up stabbing him to death . Scared almost to death Nick thinks that he was seen by a witness in the adjoining subway car doing it and then makes his way outside on the street only to be picked up by he police , not for Will's murder but for being a bit lost and out of his mind . It's not until the very last few minutes in the film that you realize just what's wrong with Nick ; his past has finally caught up with him . Nick indeed did witness a horrible event but not to the Miskowitz's or to the imaginary Will but to someone very dear and close to him . It may very well have been the murder of Sidney Miskowitz being so close to home that brought all this out . Carrying this guilt with him all his adult life Nick tried to hide it in his subconscious all these years . When it finally broke out and he was at last forced to face what he did . It was that dark and deadly secret that Nick kept hidden so deeply from himself all that time that in the end , when it finally resurfaced , drove Nick to lose not only his mind but later even his life .
Whatever they've done to your women , you deserve it !

Jack , Tom Laughlin , were given to understand in the films prologue has called it quits on society after coming home from " Nam " , South Viet Nam , with a chest full of medals as a member of the elite and tough as nails Green Berets .

One afternoon Billy Jack goes out of his way saving the life of a motorist who's being attacked and beaten by this gang of bikers known as the Born Losers , or Born to Lose . This ends up not only educating Billy Jack on what the outside world , beyond his home in the woods , is all about but makes him become an activist for among other things womens rights and the rights of self-defense . Billy ending up fined $1 , 000 . 00 , bankrupting him , and sentenced to 120 days in jail , that the judge dismissed , is outraged that the bikers who almost beat a man , the motorist that Billy saved , to death were given a much lighter sentence . Billy used a rifle , which according to the law is illegal , to save the man's life and the bikers used their fists as well as steel pipes and wooden clubs , which according the law is legal , to beat him into a pulp ! This incident at the beginning of the film " The Born Losers " sets the stage for the now arrogant and filled with hubris bikers going on a raping rampage grabbing a number of teenager , who in fact were invited over to their clubhouse , and brutally gang raping them . Among the bikers rape victims is also Vicky Barrington , Elizabeth James , who was just riding through town on her motorcycle with nothing but a florescent white bikini on . Vicky caught the eye of the bikers lead by the insect-looking , with those oddly-shaped black and white goggles on , Danny Carmody played by Jeremy Slate who just went wild over her . Looking like mousy Shelley Duvall from the neck up and voluptuously sexy Jacqueline Bissett from the neck down Vicky had that right combination of innocence and guilt , in the way she was flirting with the sex crazed bikers , that the bikers felt that she was asking for it and , despite her fending them off , piled on top of her . The local sheriff and D . A , Stuart Lancaster & Paul Bruce , were trying to make a case against the bikers but their victims , about a half dozen young women including Vicky , were just too scared to testify against them which in effect tied theirs as well as the laws ' hands . It was the bikers intimidation of the witnesses that really brought the best , or worst , out of Billy Jack in him doing what the gutless sheriff and his deputies were afraid to do , take the law into his own hands . Going from cold to hot an back again the violence avoiding and pacifistic Billy Jack purposely lets the bikers push him around so far that his adherence to violence , that he developed since he left the horrors of the Viet Nam War behind him , was slowly stripped away as he turned into the mad as hell , with his fists feet and guns , individual that he tried to repress for so long . Not just your typical biker movie " The Born Losers " in its own and amateurish way tries to tell it's audience how the law ties the hands of honest citizens by forcing them to give up their arms as well as refraining from defending themselves with anything , besides firearms , available to them . The police in the film are totally ineffective in enforcing the law in not just arresting the criminals , the bikers , and bringing them to justice but they can't even protect their victims who are needed to testify against them in court . Billy Jack who in the end saves the day , after having his skull cracked open , by putting an end to the bikers reign of terror in the little town of Big Rock ends up almost getting killed himself by the police whom he called to come to his rescue . Billy racing on a motorcycle to the hospital to see how Vicky , who was almost beaten to death by the bikers , is doing ends up being shot in the back by an overly eager sheriff's deputy who thinks he's one of the criminal bikers trying to make a run for it ! Despite all it's flaw's " The Born Losers " is by far the best of the four Blly Jack movies . This was only because the movie was made before it's star writer and director Tom Laughlin got too philosophical and sermonizing , in his screenplays , due to the amazing financial success of the Billy Jack films , which gave Laughlin complete control in making them , that followed it . " The Born Losers " at least stuck to a simple story that could easily be followed by those watching it . This made it a much better film then the three later Billy Jack movies that besides their confusingly mystic and American Indian philosophy themes also had so many sub-plots , which " The Born Losers " didn't , that you got lost watching them long before they were finally over .
Lifeless and Boring	SPOILERSI'll try to make it as short as I can in what little space that I have to tie all the loose ends together just to make some sense of it so here goes . Ed , is blackmailing his friend Big Dave , who's having an affair with his wife Doris . So that he can get $10 , 000 . 00 to open a dry cleaning business with his partner Tolliver . When Big Dave kills Tolliver thinking that he's blackmailing him only to find out that it's Ed ! Ed then kills Big Dave when Big Dave tries to kill him ! It's then that Ed's wife Doris gets arrested for killing Big Dave ! Who killed Tolliver for whom the innocent Ed gets executed for killing ! This is a short synopsis of a movie that is so laborious in it's story and it's acting that the audience will need a combination of pain killers and sleeping pills just to sit through it . With Billy Bob Thornton looking like an extra from " Night of the living Dead " who at the end of the movie when he's executed seem glad that it's finally over for him so he can get back to living . With Frances McDormand who has that look of shock on her face which gets more pronounced as the movie limps along . As if she didn't realize just how dull the script was until she signed to do it and now it's to late to back out . With Jon Polito who flipped his bird as well as his wig to end up being in the movie . And with James Grandolfini who when he's killed off , early in the film , he has that look of gratitude and relief on his face knowing that his pain and suffering by being in the movie is at last finally over .
Not just a simple case of harassment	SPOILERS Your usual psycho movie with a bit of a twist , like snapping one's neck , that has to do with this loved crazed teenager David McCall , Mark Wahlberg , who just can't let go of the object of his obsession pretty blond high school student Nicole Walker , Reese Witherspoon , whom he want's to be his " woman " even if it kills her !

David's true personality comes to the surface when he catches Nicole with her friend Gary , Todd Caldecott , outside of school kissing and almost beats the young man into a coma ! Why this dangerous lunatic wasn't arrested and put away , with the criminal record he already had , shows how slow and ineffective the justice system really is . Worming his way into both Nicole's heart and home David starts to get to work on both her parents Steve and Laura Walker , William Petersen & Amy Brenneman , with his charm and and boyish innocence . It's Nicole's dad Steve who at first sees what a lowlife and dangerous rat , in his little boy lost and without love routine , David is and this results in him being the major target , when he goes wacko , of David's mindless violence .

I didn't write the rules . I only enforce them !	SPOILERS Otto Perminger's three hour extravaganza on the inner workings of the Catholic Church is a bit heavy handed but still worth watching in his star Tom Tryon , as Father Stephen Fermoyle , unique performance in it . Father Stephen's faith is badly shaken when his sister Mona , Carol Lynley , who's both pregnant out of wedlock and on the brink of death . With only the abortion of her unborn child being able to save her life Stephen chooses the life of the child Rigena who's also played , when she's grown up , by Carol Lynley over that of his sister Mona leaving her to die in childbirth on the hospital operating table . Stephen going by his Catholic ethics has the child saved at the lost of Mona's life and that hunts him for the reminder of the film . Temporally giving up the priesthood , but not the vows he took , and becoming a teacher in Vienna Stephen meets and falls in love with one of his students Annemarie , Romy Schneide . It's when Annemarie finds out that Stephen is a Catholic Priest she drops his like a hot potato knowing that the church takes precedence over her . It's some time later when Stephen again meets Annamerie she's happily married to banker Kurt Von Hartman , Peter Weck . It's then , March 1938 , that the Nazis march into Austria and Kurt , being part-Jewish , jumps to his death , out of his and Annemarie's six floor apartment window , to avoid being arrested and put into a Nazi concentration camp by the dreaded Gestapo . Annemarie herself is arrested by the Gestapo in her being accused of trying to escape from Nazi controlled Austria which Stephen , if she only asked for his help , could have saved her from . During that same period , the late 1930's , Stephen risks his life by traveling to rural Georgia to help fellow-and black - priest Father Gillis , Ossie Davis who's church was burned down by a bunch of local Klansman . Being kidnapped and brutally horsewhipped by the hooded Klansman Father Stephen's courage to stand up to them encouraged the local black parishioners to come forward and testify against the head of the Klan in the area that put him behind bars . This , according to the movie , was the first time in the south that a white man was convicted on only the strength of a black man , or black mens , testimony ! Back at the Vatican Father Stephen's boundless courage and convictions for his fellow man has him rise to the point where he's appointed as a Cardinal to the Catholic Church . The movie ends with Father , now Carndial , Stephen telling his audience at the Vatican to follow God's rules and resist the dangers that are now surfacing all over the world in the coming , this is in the early summer of 1939 , conflict with Fascism . A warning that was sadly ignored , by the world powers at the times , and that resulted in the biggest and most destructive conflict , WWII , in human history . P . S Actor Tom Tryon who-as Father Stephen Fermoyle - was told by his superior in the film Cardnal Glennow , John Huston , that he needed to be thought a lesson in humility . Tyron was given that hard lesson by the director of the movie " The Cardinal " Otto Preminger himself . Being constantly yelled and screamed at by the ill tempered and demanding Preminger Tryon needed all the humility he could muster up to be able to finish , and not walk off , the movie set ! This in itself showed what an excellent and , in taking all that guff from Preminger , disciplined actor the late Tom Tryon really was !
Dissolved Evidence	SPOILERS This one's a real lulu in Lt . Columbo's brainy and successful crime fighting adventures against the , above average IQ , criminal element in L . A . Wanting to get the credit , and fame , all for himself in this new anti-organ rejection drug Dr . Barry Mayfield , Leonard Nimoy , sees his opportunity when his partner in that research project Dr . Edmund Hideman , Will Geer , is scheduled to be operated on by him the next day . Hideman needing a new heart-valve installed has Dr . Mayfield work on him in the operating room and successfully replaces it . The head nurse involved in the operation Nurse Sharon Martin , Ann Francis , notices that the suture , thread , that Dr . Mayfield used to sew up Hideman is of the dissolving not permanent kind . Nurse Martin feels that Dr . Mayfield who's insanely jealous of old man Hideman's success in the field of medicine , at his expense , is planning to murder him . Nurse Martin thinks that Dr . Mayfield is going make the murder look like the operation that he preformed on the old guy was just a tragic accident if it was even an accident at all ! with the sutures dissolved and gone when Hideman kicks off there would be absolutely no evidence that Mayfield had anything to do with his unfortunate demise . Finding out from Nurse Martin herself about what she's going to do in having him arrested for attempted murder Dr . Mayfield cuts her off at the pass , or hospital garage , and smashes her skull open with a tire iron killing her . Working hard to find a pasty in Nurse Martins murder Dr . Mayfield comes up with one of her patients at a local drug rehabilitation clinic , where she worked as a volunteer , reformed junkie Harry Alexander , Jared Martin . Dr . Mayfield plants bottles of morphine in the deceased Nurse Martin's apartment . This was done to make it look like she was stealing drugs out of the hospital infirmary , and selling it on the streets . Dr . Mayfield then has the now drug free and cleaned up Alexander implicated as one of her customers and very possibly her murderer . The problem for Dr . Mayfield is that Alexander is drug free and doesn't have as much as a milligram of drugs , illegal or legal , in his system or apartment . Always ahead of the curve the resourceful Dr . Mayfield sneaks into Alexanders apartment and knocks him cold sticking him in his arm with a lethal dose of morphine killing him . Alexanders timely , for Dr . Mayfield , death makes it looked like he died of a drug overdose from junk that Nurse Martin supplied him with . Lt . Colombo . Peter Falk , getting on the case seems to have met his match in the clever and slimy Dr . Mayfield . Mayfield is so cool and collective in side stepping and totally ignoring Lt . Columbo's needling and acting stupid , in order to get Dr . Mayfield to drop his guard , that it get's under Columbo's skin . Dr . Mayfield is so cagey and clever in avoiding any trap that Columbo sets for him that at one point in the movie he almost hit's him , in sheer frustration , over the head with a water pitcher . With Lt . Columbo slowly getting on to what Nurse Martin found out about the dissolving sutures Dr . Mayfield soon realized that if Hideman dies , like he planned him to , the autopsy will reveal that he was responsible not only for his death but murder . Reoperating on Hideman when he goes into cardiac arrest , after the sutures dissolves and the heart-valve dislocates , Dr . Mayfield secretly takes out the dissolving sutures and replaces them with permanent one . Only to have Lt . Columbo , like a crazed lunatic , crash into the operation room with a number of policemen , wearing doctors surgical masks . To his surprise Columbo finds out that Mayfield somehow had hidden the evidence , the dissolving sutures , that would implicated him in Hideman's attempted murder . It looked like for a time that the clever and witty Dr . Mayfield got away with it in being exposed as trying to murder old man Hideman It's also amazing to know that he would go as far as murdering two persons , Nurse Martin and Harry Alexander , in order to have the person whom he really wanted dead , Hideman , survive ! As usual Lt . Columbo is saved by the bell by exposing Mayfield as Hidelman's attempted killer in that he recognized that the cool as a cucumber Mayfied lost his cool , like Colmbo himself did earlier in the movie . It was during Columbo's wild exhibition in the operating room when Dr . Mayfield secretly , and hastily hid the damning evidence , the missing and dissolving sutures , that Lt . Columbo eventually found
Yes I hated him ! But I didn't kill him !	SPOILERS Noted for pulling all kinds of underhanded tactics on his players and those he represents as their agents Thatcher Horton , Pernell Roberts , pulled his last double-cross when he ended up at room temperature with three bullets in his chest . This happened when he was preparing to join his wife Linda , Deldne Hall , in the hot tub at his mansion . Having missed a flight to New York Tatcher felt that he needed a little rest and recreation before he would be ready to fly the next morning but ended up getting more rest then he ever expected . Having one of his star hockey players arrested and booked for Tacther's murder the confused and somewhat dull-minded , from taking too many hits on the ice , as well as washed up Bobby Spencer , Jason Beghe , is not at all in tuned to what's facing him in a court of law , first degree murder . Bobby acts like a brainless jerk when Perry Mason , Raymond Burr , is about to take on his case . Bobby in a contract dispute with Thatcher the day before threatened to murder him in front of a number of witnesses including his friend and lawyer Ken Malansky , William R . Moses . Asked by his private investigator and now aspiring , but not too successful , attorney Ken Manlansky to do him a favor by representing the very uncooperative Bobby Spencer Perry being talked down to and insulted by his clients actions just about walks out on him leaving Bobby to possibly spend the rest of is life in a state penitentiary . Bobby's actions pale in comparison to those of the kooky and what seems like very unstable hit-man Richards , S . A Griffin , who just does about everything to get himself caught . It's unbelievable to me that it took almost the entire movie for the cops and investigator Malansky , to finally catch up with him . In fact we also find out later in the film , like the last five minutes , that the guy who hired Richards to do a job on TatcherSpoilerswas actually after his son the over-pampered and snot-nose Stewart Horton , Bruce Greenwood . Stewart was having an affair with his step-mother Linda and had the killer mistakingly murder poppa when he thought , being that Tatcher was supposed to be out of town at the time , that it was him Bruce whom he was really aiming at ! One of the best of the TV Perry Mason Mystery TV movies with Perry having his work cut out for him in finding Tatcher's killer and not knowing who he is until the killer is gunned down . It's then that the truth comes out to who hired him being a guy who just couldn't take it anymore from young Bruce who was blackmailing him . It was nice to see the pretty and bubbly Alexandra Paul back again as Ken Manlansky's fiancé and partner in crime or justice Amy Hastings as she constantly has to get her boyfriend out of trouble more then get the person who put him into it . Ken again almost blows it as he instead of waiting for the cops , who had the sports arena sealed shut , to catch the hired killer he ridiculously risks his life trying to be a hero and almost getting shot for it . P . S The person who hired Richards also wasn't exactly the brightest bulb on the marquee with his leaving the murder weapon right where the cops , and Perry Mason , could find it ! It was as if he wanted to keep it as a reminder of his great work not knowing that it would put him in the big house for life where he'll have lots of free time to prefect his talents during exorcise time .
Ticking Time Bomb	SPOILER Disturbing movie about the events that led up to a bloody post office massacre in a small California post office during the week of April 15 , IRS day . One of the heaviest days of mail volume for the postal system . With postal violence reaching epidemic proportions the Postal Service hires Dr . Nicholas Brink , Richard Portnow , to conduct an in depth study on what is causing this violence and to see what can be done to cure it . Being sent to the above mentioned post office to study the workers and see what he can do to first identify and then defuse potential time bombs in that post office before they explode and end up killing themselves as well as their fellow postal workers . Dr . Brink narrows down his study to three people : Two who are very likely to go off the handle and one who is playing with fire , them , and may well be the reason that sets them off . Dr . Brink gets little help from the postmaster Calhoun Benedict , William Long Jr . who's only interested in getting the mail out at all cost at the expense of the physical as well as mental health of those postal employees that he's in charge of which is very counter-productive to what Dr . Brink is trying to do . Dr . Brink correctly zeros in on postal clerk Tammy Syke , Grace Cavanaugh , who was a survivor of a previous post office massacre in Dearborn Michigan the year before . Tammy's boyfriend at that postal facility Patrick Henry Shipper lost his mind and then went berserk and opened fire on his fellow workers killing eight of them before he was subdued by the police . Dr . Brink feels that Tammy was in some way responsible for Shippers actions by manipulating his emotions and setting him off . Dr . Brink sees that Tammy is doing the same thing in this post office with two workers Orsen Starks , Brad Garrett , and Harry Cash , Rob Roy Fitzgerald , by manipulating and playing them off against each other for her affections . Even more shocking is that Tammy's father is in jail for a multiple murder of some of Tammy's friends when she was a teenager some ten years ago who Tammy made to look like that they were abusing her , which drove her father to lose his mind and murder them . Tammy , Dr . Brink conclude , is a very unstable young woman . It seems that she gets some kind of thrill or kick at the sight and knowledge of people killing and injuring themselves over in manipulating them like her fellow postal workers Starks and Cash . It doesn't take long as that dreaded day April 15 , where the stress and tension in that post office has reached it's absolute breaking point , rolls in all the ingredients for an explosion have been mixed together for the movies violent final ending . Violent and disturbing movie that tries to mix comedy with tragedy but there's nothing funny about what happens in the film . If there's anything one can learn from " Postal Worker " is that when people aren't treated with understanding to what's bothering them without any thoughts concerns or consideration for their feelings , by their superiors as well as their co-workers , Bad Things Can Happen And Usually Do . " Postal Worker " should have been made as a totally serious movie instead of a black comedy . There's nothing funny about the incredibly bloody ending as well as the beginning of the movie where Dr . Brink views a tape recording of a previous and equally bloody postal shooting at the Dearborn Michigan Post Office where Tammy used to work at which seems to have been taken by a hidden camera .
Don't look in the Basement !	SPOILERS Odd ball urban horror thriller set in Manhattan but filmed Montreal Canada that has these old geezers more or less kidnapping young couples , formerly orphaned and now childless Yuppies , in order to experiment with in what looks like a crude attempt of draining off their youthful vigors and energies . It's after that the oldsters use those youthful attributes to keep themselves young , or at least alive , indefinitely . Tripping up and mugging youthful and athletic Matt Lawrence , Dead Cain , as he's doing his afternoon jog in Central Park the mugger is chased by these old folks who , after not being able to catch up with him offer the battered Matt an apartment in their townhouse on the expensive upper East Side for cheap outer borough , from Manhattan , rents . Moving in with his newlywed wife Jackie , Porita de Rossi , Matt finds that the oldsters are obsessed with young and childless , as well as healthy , couples like him and Jackie . All this doesn't seem to mean that much to him at the time but when the previous couple at the townhouse , also young and childless , suddenly disappear almost without a trace . Matt and Jackie start to get a bit suspicious of just what these old fogies are really up to . It's really Jackie who gets the drop on the strange and eccentric neighbors as she begins to realize that their somehow trying to poison her with this weird concoction of spring water and strawberry syrup , as well as herbal ice tea . Later when she gets pregnant her unborn baby is killed by one of the bunch turning up the heat in the basement sauna , a freebie for living at the townhouse . It's when Jackie with the help of her co-worker Randy , Jonas Chernick , finds out that the neighbor are lying about their age being well into their 100's not their 70's and 80's that she smells a rat . Randy is then run down and killed in a hit and run outside his studio and Jackie finds the car that did Randy in , parked in the basement of her townhouse . She then finally realized that she's living with a bunch of old psycho killers who are eventually going to do in both her and her totally unaware husband Matt . The movie never explains just what these old psycho's are really up to in that we never get just why they go not only for the young and healthy people in their neighborhood but why do they have to have been orphaned to be kidnapped . The young couples being in the pink of health and childless does in some ways makes sense by why do they have to be murdered ? You could have grown up with out any parents but have dozens of friends who would miss , if that's the reason for the old folks wanting orphans to experiment on , you just as much and go out looking for you like Matt and Jackie's good friends both Thrish and Allan , Sabrina Grdevich & Jason Blicker , did . Even at the point of risking or even losing , like Trish & Allan did , their lives in doing it ! The ending was somewhat of a letdown in that we never really get to find out , we can only speculate , just what the old crowd wanted in people like Matt and Jackie other then drive them out of their skulls and eventually murder them . Were shown that even when this old crew , the townhouse psycho's , are put out of commission theirs alway a new crew ready to step up to the plate and in their shoes and continue their wild and crazy , as well as murderous , experiments .
I know what you want baby ! I've got everything that Rich had and more !	( Some Spoilers ) Old money and high society sleaze make " Where Love Has Gone " one of the best of it's kind in how the other side lives loves and cheats on each other . War hero and USAAF fighter ace Major Luke Miller , Mike Conners , gets caught up with a world that even the trials and tribulations of the Second World didn't properly prepare him for . In Phoenix Arizona discussing an upcoming project for the city Luke gets a call from San Francisco for him to fly right over in that there's trouble brewing for his fifteen year old daughter Daniell , or Dani , played by Joey Heatherton the real life daughter of TV's popular " Merry Mailman " . It turns out that Dani was involved in a free for all between her mother Valerie Hayden Miller , Susan Hayward , and her mothers lover Richard Lazich . During the wild and hysterical slug-fest Dani ran through Richard with a knife killing him . We soon realize that both Luke and Valerie have been divorced and it's their separation that caused Dani to drift into very wild and dangerous company that has caused her to lose control of both her emotions and actions . Valerie who had a strict upbringing by her mother Mrs . Gerald Hayden , Bette Davis , had let her daughter Dani grow up wild and free . This caused Dani to lead a life of wild sex as well as partying with much older men losing her virginity before she was 15 years old ! We get a long flashback of how Luke met Valerie , a world famous artist and sculptor , during WWII and how her mother Mrs . Hayden practically forced Valerie , even though she was in love with him in the first place , to marry Luke . Mrs . Hayden was the epitome of a nosy and intrusive mother-in-law making Luke's life a living hell controlling both him and his means of making an honest living . Mr . Haydens actions kept Luke from his love of building buildings for the state by having him blackballed out of the real-estate and architecture business . Forcing a helpless and unemployed Luke to work for her building company Mrs . Hayden had the once proud and independent Luke Miller broken down to nothing more then an leach and moocher where he had to live off both his wife's and mother-in-laws money in order for him to survive . All this didn't help young Dani who growing up had no father to look up to with her dad Luke turning to the bottle for comfort and at the same time help make him forget what a failure he really was . As we get back into the present , 1964 , we see that Dani who's charged as a juvenile in Richard Lazichs death knows a lot more then she , and her mother , are willing to let out . It's the last ten or so minutes of the movie at Dani's trial that the awful and devastating truth comes out of what really happened that evening when Richard Lazich was stabbed to death . This shocking revelation that was so x-rated back then , we weren't even given the benefit to see it in a flashback , that it completely blew away Valerie as well as her mother Mrs . Hayden . This all lead SPOILER ALERT the poor and emotionally destroyed Valerie Hayden Miller to rush back to her studio and do herself in the very same way her lover Richard Lazich was . Too shocking and outrageous to mention even now some 40 years after it's release the movie " Where Love Has Gone " indescribable ending will leave you , like every one in it , sputtering with disbelief . In that something as shocking like that , the goings on between Valerie Dani and Richard Lazich , was even considered to be put into a film , as sleazy as it was , way back then . The movie is actually based on the Lana Turner Johnny Stomponato affair back in April 1958 where Lana's 14 year old daughter Cheryl was convicted in Stomponato's , a notorious Los Angelas gangster , justifiable killing . In the movie " Where Love Has Gone " the final few minutes totally outdoes and eclipses whatever happened in real life between Lana Johnny and Cheryl by a wide country mile !
Now That's Gratitude For Ya !	SPOILERS Somewhat confusing crime drama that's based on a true story , maybe that's why it's so confusing , about this parolee Lucinda Michaels , Cheryl Ladd , who gets involved with this very very very successful lawyer the sweet and very likable Clay Spencer , Mike Farrell , and takes him for the ride of his life ; straight into the city morgue . This whole sordid adventure started out as a harmless prank on the part of Lucinda's parole officer local cop Matt Harding played by John Cassavettes look alike Nick Mancuso . Playing a practical joke on his friend Clay , who's been divorced for some six years , Matt has him set up with his parolee client Lucindia feeling that he and Clay , as well as Lucinda , will get a big laugh out of the whole deal . It turns out that Clay ends up going ape-sht over the shapely and hot as a pistol Lucinda , who was some eight months pregnant at the time , and before you can say Jackie Robinson the two were hitched , married , in the biggest social event that town had in years . Grateful to her husband at first for all the things that he's given her together with her new born child , from her previous husband , Britiany , Clair Marie Hooker , Lucinda turns as rotten as a months old container of spoiled milk as she starts going on a spending spree leaving Clay in debt , over her extravagant lifestyle , tens of thousands of dollars . Lucinda really goes overboard when she starts to turn the screws on Clay's young and handsome , like his pop , son Nick , Michael Woolson , who despite all of Lucinda's trying resist her very sexy and aggressive advances which must have taken superhuman self-control on Nick's part . Clay smelling a rat when an acting scared and concerned Lucinda tells him that she's getting obscene and threatening phone calls has Matt tap his , and Lcinda's , phones . It's then when Clay finds out that his very greedy and ungrateful wife is trying to seduce and screw his innocent and very confused son Nick , who has a study girlfriend Samantha played by Cody Tucker , behind his back and decides to cut the two-timing hussy out of his will . As it turned out Lucinda gets to Clay first not only leaving him dead with a bullet to his left temple but his totally innocent son Nick implicated in his fathers murder . The movie " Vows of Deception " was pretty good for the first half but started to really lag after Clay's body was discovered in his mansion by Lucinda . We were giving the runaround to if Clay's death was a murder or a suicide . All the evidence seemed to point to the obviously innocent and framed , by Lucinda , Nick . Still it was hard , even if you fell for Lucinda's frame-up , to see how Nick could have knocked off his old man . The two , Nick & Cay , were always getting along fine and only Lucinda's lies about her step-son was the only evidence , if you could call it that , against him . Nick for his part was such a good and feeling son that he refused to bring out Lucinda's infidelities towards his father and his rejections of his step-mothers efforts in trying to get him romantically involved with her . That in itself would have easily cleared Nick of Lucinda's ridiculous charges of murdering Clay , but Nick kept it under the table in order not to soil his fathers good name and memory . SPOILER ALERTIn the end it was Matt , who felt very guilty for having him introduce Lucinda to Clay , that broke the case wide open by finding the murder weapon , Nick's gun , where Lucinda hid it . This before she could plant it on Nick , or in Nick's home , in what Lucinda called Plan B that would have iced Nick , with a murder rap and conviction , and had her get off Scot-free in her husbands and Nick's fathers murder .

But that's quickly broken when Jimmy's wife Bev , Helen Hunt , is killed in a car crash that Ronnie was responsible for . It turned out that instead of looking after Bev and her , and Jimmy's , infant daughter Corinna , Lindsay J . Wrinn , Ronnie was taking advantage of Bev while Jimmy was locked up . Also the day she was killed got Ronnie got Bev drunk and took her home to his place for both fun and games . Bev waking up from her alcohol-induced sleep ran out of Ronnie's place into her car and , still being under the influence , drove into an oncoming truck killing herself . Realizing what Ronnie did Jimmy agrees with the State prosecutor Frank Zioli , Stanley Tucci , to rat on his fellow car-thieves at a closed door grand jury implicating even himself in number of car robberies ; but slyly keeps Ronnie's name out of it . The news of the car-theft gang being ratted out by someone from the inside gets back to Little Junior from his mobbed-up lawyer Jack Gold , Anthony Heald . It's then agreed that it had to be Ronnie , since he was the only member who wasn't indicted , who ratted on his gang and in no time at all Little Junior pay him a friendly visit with a half dozen of his goons that turns out to be Ronnie's funeral . Having served his time Jimmy is released from Sing Sing Prison but the aggressive State procurator Zioli has plans for him to get Little Junior in a sting operation which will result in him getting a federal judgeship . Going to Little Junior's Baby Cakes strip club Jimmy having a wire planted on him by the police , in order to get evidence . Jimmy gets friendly with the mob boss only to be later shaken down in the clubs bathroom to see if he's working for the cops or not . Jimmy realizing what was going down threw away his wire before Little Junior and his boys got to him . As crazy as Little Junior is he still strikes me as a pretty smart cookie being able to sense if he's being set up in a sting operation , with a wiretap . But later he act's so stupidly that he guns down in cold blood an undercover federal agent Omar , Ving Khames , right in front of a shocked Jimmy who's got a wire on him . This in the end can lead to Little Junior to be indited and arrested for murder one . With Jimmy having the incriminating tape it looked like a slam dunk to convict Little Junior but his lawyer Jack Gold comes to his rescue having the evidence thrown out on a technicality ; Little junior killed a federal agent thinking that he was hood like himself and even more convincing it was in self-defense ! With Little Junior out free Jimmy , who's cover was blown , is now a marked man and with only Det . Hart , who's since become bonded with him , willing to help Jimmy it looks as if it's only a matter of time before he's history . But unknown to Little Junior as well as the double-crossing state procurator Zioli , who promised Jimmy that he and his family would be protected , Jimmy had devised a plan to keep himself alive . And that plan is to use the same method that get him into hot water to get him out of it : the wiretap . The David Caruso came across completely colorless as Jimmy Kilmartin showing in most of his scenes almost no emotion at all . The final scene in the movie showed that he , or Jimmy , also wasn't all that bright even though he miraculously survived a assassination attempt on his life . . NIcholas Cage as the mob boss Little Junior has a very serious asthma condition but looks and act in the pink of health . He even lifts heavy weights , as well as showgirls , 15 at a time without even breathing hard . Little Junior also viciously beats people up sometimes to death , very strenuous exorcise for an asthmatic . With the only sign of his asthma condition is the occasionally asthmatic aerosol spry that he uses to keep himself from possibly suffocating to death . Samual L . Jackson as Det . Hart is totally wasted as the good cop who risk his job and life in setting up his bosses in the federal government and NYPD . I also found it odd that Jimmy's wiretaps on both Little Junior and prosecutor Zioli had such an impact of bringing them both down to earth , Little Junior in jail and Zioli facing a serious ethics charge , that can also put him behind bars . When the wiretaps were done without a court order not only making them illegal but even criminal on Jimmy's part ? Just earlier in the movie a court ordered wiretap that resulted in getting evidence of the murder of a federal agent , by Little Junior , was thrown out of the same courtroom on the most flimsiest of legal technicalities . But these totally illegal and uncalled for wiretaps , on Little Junior and Zioli , were allowed to stand !
We'll check every pool in the valley for a sign of their secretion	SPOILERS With a strong earthquake erupting under the Salton Sea in Southern California it opened up a hole where there were some prehistoric giant sleeping Mollusks . The Mollusks not only came back to life but started killing and eating a number of people and cattle in and around the sea . They then start laying eggs to bring and replenish their extinct species back to the point that they'll overflow the inland Salton Sea and work their way into all the waterways and oceans of the earth . Eating everything , man animal fish plant insect , on the planet into extinction . The US Navy having a top secret base on the southern tip of the Salton Sea and experimenting with atomic energy has a lot of explaining to do to the American people in the fact that the Mollusks are now a danger to the nation , as well as the very earth itself . The Navy had been fooling around with nuclear fission in and around the sea that caused , together with the earthquake , the mollusks to grow to such enormous sizes and breed like a bunch of sex starved rabbits . After losing a number of Navy men and some civilians along the sea the Navy goes out on a hunting trip to find these killer Mollusks . It soon confronts a number of them ending up capturing an unhatched egg of the creatures . With the commander of the naval base John " Twill " Twillinger , Tim Holt , in charge together with the head scientist Dr . Jess Rogers , Hans Conried , they place the egg in a temperature controlled tank at 38 degrees to keep the egg from hatching . The up-tight and by-the-books commander Twillinger get very friendly with one of the young women at the base secretary Gail MacKenzie , Andrey Dalton . Thats after finding here cute but somewhat bratty little daughter Sandy , Mimi Gibson , lost lady bug which leads to Twillinger finding an opening to Gail's heart . It turns that Gale lost her husband in a tragic naval accident two years ago . Twillinger takes Gale out to dinner where he spends more time looking at her then eating his meal . Meanwhile the deadly and giant Mollusks begin to fan out of the Salton Sea and move into a nearby canal . Killing and eating everything in their path including , in the most jarring scene in the film , an old and cranky canal lock operator , Ralph Moody . Who thought the story about these " Monsters from the deep " , that the Salton Sea Naval Station warned him about , was all a joke until he himself got swallowed by one of them . The Navy tracks down where the Mollusks are and where their laying their eggs and with Twillinger and Dr . Tad Johns , Max Showpher , donning naval scuba outfits they both go underwater and plant explosives in the Mollusks breeding grounds ; thus blasting them and their eggs to pieces . What Twillinger and the Navy forgot was that back at the naval stations laboratory there was still an unhatched giant Mollusk egg and little Sandy , being there with her mom Gail , decided to heat up the place by raising the temperature level of the water . That caused the Mollusk to hatch and go on a wild rampage . Exciting and nail-biting final with Commander Twillinger , or " Twill " to his friends , coming to the rescue of Gail and Sandy who both locked themselves up in a side room to escape the crazed earthworm-like mutation . Twillinger single-handedly holds off the mad and surging Mollusk with a fire extinguisher and then steam hose until the troops finally arrive blasting the slimy thing right back into the stone age .
Why can't it just be me and not her !	( Some Spoilers ) Surprisingly effective made-for-TV murder mystery that keeps it's audience in the dark as to who the killer is until the last ten minutes or so of the movie . Even though it seems obvious to who the killer is almost from the start . Young Justine Essex , Charlotte Ross , is being influenced by stories her friend , or former best friend , Ashley , Amy Moore , is telling Justine about her boyfriend Ryan , David Lasher . David is having an affair with her now best friend Vicky , Kimberly Hopper . The three girls having a showdown , over Vicky's betrayal of Justine with her divorced mom Susan , Katey Sagal , out on a date with her old high-school flame Eric , Jamerson Parker , ends up with Vicky falling to her death in the woods . It's obvious from the start that it was both Justine and Ashley who were responsible for Vicky's death chasing her out of Justin's home to the place where she was later found dead . As the movie goes on there are things that seemed to have been overlooked by the police and the audience that shows that Vicky's death was a lot stranger and far more sinister then you would of at first thought . Making a pact with each other Ahsley and Justine swear to keep what happened the night that Vicky was killed to themselves and stick to their story that they were never there with Vicky in both Justine's home and in the the woods . The police slowly start to pick their story apart and Justine ends up , due to the overwhelming evidence against her , being indited for Vicky's murder . It's then when we start to realize there was a lot more going on with Vicky's love life then we were at first thought to believe . It's found out after the autopsy that Vicky was three months pregnant and that she kept a daily journal that kept referring to her boyfriend , and future father of her baby , simply as the letter " R " ? Was that to mean Ryan Justine's boyfriend ? Ryan confronted by Justine about his supposed affair with Vicky denies that he had nothing more to do with Vicky then just give her a kiss much less have a relationship with her that resulted in Vicky becoming pregnant . Were also told that this mysterious Mister " R " wanted Vicky to have an abortion but she refused ; could that have been the reason for her murder ? Ryan had gotten a full scholarship to college and if it were reveled that he got a girl pregnant it would have had it revoked . Could that have been the reason that he , if he did , murder Vicky ? With all the evidence of Vicky's murder pointing to Justine it seems to be an open and shut case for the local District Attorney to convict . It then comes out that Justine's mom Susan is involved romantically with the police detective on the case Eric Reilly , Jamerson Parker , and the case is thrown out of court . Still the the suspicion that Justine murdered Vicky is still fresh in the minds of the people of Clovis especially Vicky's parents Dr . Gilmore and his wife Elaine , Linda Pierce . Getting together with Ryan Justine goes out to the murder scene in the woods and finds a numbers of items that were overlooked by the police ; both Justine & Ryan find Vicky's car keys and that her body was moved some five miles from where she supposedly fell to her death . The evidence leads both Ryan and Justine to this empty cabin that was earlier discovered but somehow the evidence there overlooked by Justine and her mom Susan Essex where an audio tape was found purporting to be that of Ryan dedicating love songs to Vicky . Can it be the same Ryan that's Justine's boyfriend and who's with her alone In the woods and very possibly Vicky's murderer ? While all this is happening Justine's mom Susan Essex unknowingly comes across the real murderer of Vicky back in town which not only puts her life in danger but exposes the real and sick motive for Vicky's murder which is about as shocking a revelation as any good script writer could have dreamed up ; a real stunner .
Do you understand what benefits that mankind will reap on my research on the " Immune System " !	SPOILERS Another movie about an arrogant nut-job who thinks that he's God in playing with peoples lives in the name of " Higher Science " . In this case Assistant District Attorney Katie Demaio ends up at the receiving end of the psycho's sick delusions of grandeur by getting involved with him by being admitted in the hospital that he works at . Recovering from a car accident Katie is admitted to the Westlake Fertility Clinic not because she has problems giving birth but because the local hospital was filled to capacity . Heavily doped up on drugs Katie just happened to look outside her hospital room window and saw someone taking this unconscious woman , who turned out to be Vangie Lewis , into the trunk of his car . It's much later when Vangie's body was discovered in her home dead from a cyanide cocktail that things started to gel in Katie's brain in remembering the evening she saw her outside , with her possible murderer , her hospital room . What's even worse for Katie is that the person who stuffed Vangie's dead body in the trunk of his car saw her too and that's when her life , as well as a number of other persons connected to him , became endangered . Incredibly complicate made for TV movie that has at least a half dozen sub-plots in it besides just the one about who murdered , and made to look like a suicide , Vangie Lewis . There's also Vangie's cheating husband airline pilot Capt Chris Lewis who's having an affair with his stewardess Joan Morton who want's him to ditch Vangie and fly off with her to sunny Jamaica . There's also the two doctors at the clinic the British educated Dr . Edger Hghley and his top assistant the cagey and secretive , about his past , Japanese / American Dr . Fachita who both seem to know a lot more about Vangie's pregnancy then there's telling Katie . It was at her insistence that Katie was put on the case by her boss in the city D . A's office Alex Myerson . To make things even more exciting , or complicated , there's Dr . Salem who's Vangie's gynecologist from her home state of Minnesota who's certain that she's clinically unable to get pregnant ! So how on God's earth did Vangie end up dead with a seven month old fetus in her womb ? And last but not least there's the nosy and very concerned , and the late Vangie's good friend , receptionist at the Westlake Fertility Clinic Edna Burns . It's Mrs . Burns who has an inkling to who Vangie's murderer really is but never lives to talk about it by becoming the killer's latest victim in the movie . We also have a sweet little side love story with the local police pathologist Dr . Richard Carroll who's just out and out crazy about Katie who's husband John died of cancer two years ago . Dr . Carroll loves his job not just because of it's good pay and medical and pension benefits but because it has him spend most of his time working together , and thus being able for him to strike up a relationship , with Katie . The ending is not at all that surprising since we already know who Vangie's , as well as the two other murder victims in the film , killer really is . The big surprise is how totally insane the murderer is and yet at the same time him be able to keep his insanity hidden and under raps from almost the entire length of the movie !
Murder by Special Delivery	SPOILERS Based on a true story the movie " the Inspectors " has to do with a gang of pot smoking and booze swigging wackos who have it in for anyone who would dare to drive through their turf the town of Bayfield in rural Virgina . We find out what the real reason for the mail bombing of the Carrigan home , outside Baltimore , that killed Jacob and badly injured his wife Jane was when the son Drew is apprehended by the Postal Inspectors . As they showed up at his home just to ask him some questions why anyone would want to kill his parents . Under intense questioning Drew broke down and admitted that he was the real target of the mail bomb . In that he testified against his former friends Skell & Spider in a double murder that they participated in . What was so unusual about the mail bombing is that Drew's friends who are suspected in the bombing were serving a life sentence for murder in a maximum security prison at the time ! Documentary-like story of how the Postal Inspectors track down and get their man , or woman , and how the law enforcement agencies , state and local police as well as the FBI , work together with the inspectors in doing it . With ace Postal Inspector Frank Hughes , who was a former mailman and has a number of dog bites to prove it , put on the case he's teamed up with Harvard graduate and rookie Alex Ubina to find out how this crime was both planned and executed from inside the state prison . It turns out that Spider was in contact with his girlfriend Amy who together with Lester Glover the troubled son of Bayfields Sheriff Glover , who was covering up for him , were involved in concocting the explosive device and then sending it through the US Mail . With nothing to lose the two convicted murderers who were so determined to kill the stoolie , Drew Carringan , killed his father and critically injuring his mother Jane by mistake . Now their just as determined to kill his young son Edison , with the outside help of Amy & Lester . That's if the Postal Inspectors , Hughs & Ubina , don't get to and disarm the mail bomb by them sent to young Edison as a birthday present first . High wire tension as a sweating and nervous Inspector Ubina tries to get Edison not to open his birthday present knowing it would blow him , as well as anyone as close as thirty feet from him , to pieces as we all hold our breath for the movies final and very unexpected outcome . The film " The Inspectors " shows that Postal Inspector work is anything but easy like catching people using counterfeit bills to buy stamps , as we see early in the film . Seeing What both Inspector Hughs and Ubina go through in the movie , risking their lives and limbs over and over again , more then proves it .
Bubber's back in town	SPOILERSWith the electrifying news of convicted car thief Charles " Bubber " Reeves , Robert Redford , crashing out of prison the little Texas town of Tarl is put under the microscope to what exactly Bubber's past is about to reveal once he makes it back there . Being away for some two years Bubber's old lady Anna , Jane Fonda , has been having a hot and heavy affair with his best friend Jake Rogers , James Fox . Jake is now a bit worried at what his friend Bubber would do if he finds out that both him and Anna have been screwing Bubber and themselves behind his back . There's also the fact that wimpy bank VP Edwin Stewart , Robert Duvell , is terrified that Bubba would settle an old score with him when the two were teenagers . Edwin had stolen some $50 . 00 and had the innocent Bubber take the rap for it . It the middle of all this confusion is the town Sheriff Calder , Marlon Brando , who's trying to keep the peace but not getting any cooperation from the locals who feel that he's just a paid off stooge of Tarl's leading citizen as well as it's power broker Jake's dad Val Rogers E . G Marshall . Bubber for his part again gets screwed , this seems to happens a lot to him in the movie , by his fellow escapee Butcher who murdered traveling salesman McCormick during a carjacking . Now an escaped murderer as well as car thief Bubber has nothing to lose knowing he faces life imprisonment , or worse , if caught and is more then determined not to be taken alive . Sheriff Calder knowing that Bubber didn't murder McCormick tries to get him to give himself up but runs into a road block when he refuses to let out just were Bubber is hiding ; in his friends Lester's , Joel Fluellen , junkyard . Breaking into the towns jail a gang of drunken and unruly citizens work over Sheriff Calder , leaving his face almost unrecognizable , as they beat the truth out of Lester to just were Bubber is . Anna and Jake having been told by Sheriff Calder to talk Bubber into giving himself up end up being trapped , together with Bubber , in the junkyard as carload after carload of local adults and teenagers descend on the junkyard in a drunken frenzy . Somewhat recovered from the beating that he got Sheriff Calder gets to the junkyard together with Val Rogers , who's trying to get his son Jake out of harms way , to get Bubber into custody as well as try to prevent the local and now out of control townspeople from setting the entire place on fire . The tragic ending of the movie has Jake crushed to death by an exploding and flying car radiator with both Anna and Val Rogers losing a son a lover and husband during the drunken and fiery orgy . Bubber is taken into custody by Sheriff Calder only to be gunned down on the steps to the police station , much like Lee Harvey Oswald , by one of Tral's biggest troublemakers Archie , Steve Ihrat , who must have been afraid of just what Bubber knew and would bring out into the open about him . This cowardly act on Archie's part , shooting a helpless and handcuffed man , was even more horrific with Bubba's parents Mr . & Mrs . Reeves , Miriam Hopkins & Malcolm Atterbury , being on the scene to watch in horror as their son gets shot to pieces . Somewhat over-dramatic but still very thought-provoking film on how fear and loathing , as well as mob rule , can turn a town of peaceful and law-abiding citizens into a bloodthirsty lynch mob . Bubber Reeves was anything but innocent , he was in fact innocent of murder , but still deserved his day in court . It was Bubber's escape and presence in town that was bringing out all the skeleton's that many people there , in high places , wanted kept out of the headlines and in the closet that more then anything else lead to his brutal murder .
The Keys to the Kingdom	SPOILERS Decent 1950's film noir crime drama despite the very contrived and , due to the restrictive Hayes Commission , unconvincing ending . In an attempt to screw his former partner in crime , the head of West Coast illegal gambling racket , Paul De Camp , James Seay , L . A racketeer Willis Trent , Barry Kroeger , needs someone to makes him a set of safe deposit keys in order to break into and loot De Camp's box of some $200 , 000 . 00 in ill gotten gains . The Trent mobs gets totally innocent locksmith Tony Dancer , William Campbell , to do it's dirty work for it . Trent first has Tony's girlfriend Betty Turner ( Karen Sharpe Kramer ) , whom he accentually met a cocktail party thrown by Trent , threatened to have her face worked over by his bodyguard the 6 foot five inch ex professional boxer Louie , Mike Mazurki . Tony goes along with Trent's demands but just as he's about to get his hands , in the banks safe deposit vault , on De Camp's cash he has a sudden change of mind and takes off with the money himself leaving both De Camp and Trent empty-handed . With De Camp finding out that his cash was heisted right under his nose he realizes that his sexy and well endowed girlfriend Flo Randell , Anita Ekberg , had two-timed him and beats the truth out of her . Flo had been having an affair behind De Camp's back with his lawyer the very handsome but almost always drunk Earl Farraday , Robert Keys . Farraday secretly working for Trent had used the beautiful Flo to get the number of De Camp's safe deposit box , as well as the bank where it's at , with the promise that he'll split half the loot that's in it with her . The suspenseful ending in an empty and darkened L . A bowling alley was as good as anything you'd see in an Alfred Hitchcock thriller . Tony , who stashed the stolen money in a locker at the bowling alley , is constantly hounded by this unseen and shadowy assassin . The man in the shadows is trying to knock Tony off with a combination of bowling balls and bullets as he tries to make his getaway together with , the then held hostage by Trent's henchman Louie , Betty Turner . The final ending is a bit too pat and unbelievable to really take seriously and is about the only thing that spoiled the movie for me . But up until then " Man in the Vault " was about as good a movie , or film noir , as I would have expected and for that reason alone well worth watching up until the last two minutes . P . S I just couldn't get over the strong resemblance of actor William Campbell to Tony Curtis . Campball in fact was even better looking , in a pretty boy sort of way , then Curtis ever was . On top of all that Campbell didn't have that very thick Bronx accent , " Younder lies the castle of my Fattdaa " , that Tony Curtis had when he first started out in films . That unintentionally comical accent was to become the butt of so many jokes about Tony Curtis among both movie goers and critics as well as stand up comedians back in the 1950's .
Drilling Home a Point .	( Some Spoilers ) One of the better slashers movies of the 1980's that gets right to the point even before the opening credits stop rolling . Escaping from prison where he's been incarcerated since 1969 Russ Thorn , Michael Villella , doesn't take long to start on his murderous campaign against society by drilling to death a telephone repair worker , Jean Vargas , and then using her company van to make his getaway . Already having murdered five people for which he was given a life sentence the on the loose Thorn is out to make up for all the lost time that he spent behind bars . Thorn using a power-drill ends up boring to death some ten persons , as well as some members of the audience , before his reign of terror is over . " Slumber Party Massacre " is a lot better then you would have expected it to be with the tension and action nicely paced . Thron goes from victims to victim from one part of Tris Devereaud's , Michelle Michaels , house to another as he slowly knocks them off one person at a time until the final scene . Thorn is confronted at the end of " Slumber Party Massacre " by Trish together with Val and her kid sister Courtney , Robin Stille & Jenifer Meyers , and the girl's high-school coach Carpenter , Pamala Gazano , who all turned out to be more that a match for the insane killer . Like most , if not all , of these movie slasher psychos Thorn seems to have supernatural powers and no matter how much punishment he takes Thorn still comes back for more . Even when he has both his hands sliced and chopped off as well as run through with a machete and then thrown into a swimming pool where he's left to both drown and bleed to death . The acting in the film isn't anything to write home about with the girls trapped in the house by Thorn about as convincing , in trying to show any kind of fear and terror toward him , as if they found to their shock and horror that the hot and sizzling pizza that they ordered ice cold . In fact in one of the scenes after the local pizza delivery boy , Aaron Lipstadt , gets killed by Thorn they act so shrill and phony that for a moment you thought that it , the delivery boys death , was some kind of prank played on them by their boyfriends . They act more realistic and show more emotion eating slices of the pizza that he delivered then they did when he was murdered right in front of their eyes . You have to give the acting credits in the movie to Michael Villella as the psycho / driller / killer who uses his power drill as if it were an extension of his own libido . He's even photographed in some of his scenes with his power drill pointing menacingly between his legs , geared up and ready . It's as if he's about to drill , or screw , to death his mostly female victims . Thorn looked like he was far more hurt when his precious power drill had it's point chopped off by Valerie then when she sliced him up like a piece of swiss cheese . Thorn who didn't say a single word during almost the entire movie did open his mouth finally at the end . You could see why the director was wise enough to have him keep his mouth shut for as long as he did . He was a lot more effective when he let his drill do the talking for him .
Do you sell books ? What does this look like ! A Banana ?	SPOILERS Re-made Raymond Chandler film-noir classic that just doesn't have the drama and suspense of the original Bogart / Bacall 1946 film that in some ways was even more confusing then the less effective 1978 remake . We have in this version of " The Big Sleep " Robert Mitchum as the not so usual down on his luck , barley keeping up with paying the rent for his shabby office , private detective Philip Marlow . Marlow drives around in a $50 , 000 . 00 car checking the time on his $5 , 000 . 00 Rollex watch and wearing clothes personally tailored and cut to size never getting dirty torn or even creased no matter how many beatings he take throughout the movie ! This time around Philip Marlow is working his trade , as a PI , in the green rolling countryside of the 1970's jolly old England not the dark dirty and gritty streets of 1940's L . A . Coming to see his latest client sick and disabled millionaire General Sternwood , James Stewart , Marlow is told that he's being blackmailed by this local bookstore owner Arthur Geiger , John Justin . Geiger has a number of nude photos of General Sternwood's wacky's younger daughter Camilla , Candy Clark , and is threatening to make them public if the General doesn't pay him 10 , 000 Pound Sterling . We , and Philip Marlow , see right away that Camilla is a bit off her rocker but what we don't realize is that General Sternwood is really interested in finding her missing husband Rusty Regan , David Seville , whom he seems to have become very found of in his stories about himself and his exploits as an Irish patriot . Besides Camilla there's also the Generals slightly nymphomaniac older daughter Charlotte , Sara Miles , who like the younger Carmilla is always making a play for the much older , and not at all interested , Philip Marlow that's keeping him from doing his job . Marlow tries to track down Geiger and finds him in his house , with a naked and goofy Carmilla , shot dead between the eyes . It's later found out that the Sternwood family chauffeur Owen Taylor , Martin Potter , killed Geiger in a fit of anger when he found out that he was photographing his secret lover Carmilla in the nude . It's later that Taylor is himself killed and , together with his car , thrown into the nearby river by an associate of Geiger Joe Brody , Edward Fox . Fox murdered Taylor in order to steal Geiger's film that Taylor had on him but at the same time not knowing that Geiger was already dead . The story leads into a number of different directions that has to do with a local British mobster Eddie Mars , Oliver Reed , and his club-footed and sadistic hit-man known as the Brown Man Lush Canino , Richard Boone , and members of London's sleazy and dangerous Red Light district that includes some of the late Arthur Geiger's gay lovers . All this shenanigans leaves some half dozen corpses behind in it's wake but the real crux of the story goes right back to the missing son-in-law of General Sternwood Rusty Regan . Philip Marlow sensed right from the beginning that General Sternwood was only interested in Rusty's disappearance not his daughter , and Rusty's wife , Carmilla being blackmailed . Wanting to know for himself as well as his client , General Sternwood , if Rusty is either alive or dead Marlow begins to realizes that only Carmilla can provide that answer . Being mentally unbalanced may very well be the result of what Carmilla knows about Rusty . Taking a chance Marlow sets Carmilla up , in a scheme that he secretly devised , in order to find out just what she not only knows about her missing husbands whereabouts but also if she had something to do with his disappearance in the first place . Marlow's scheme entrapping Carmilla and finding out about what happened to Rusty Regan sadly pays off and shocking proves what Philip Marlow suspected about Carmilla all along . Now Marlow has to somehow keep her father General Sternwood from finding it out in order not just to keep from breaking his heart but also from causing him to suffer a fatal heart-attack . Having solved the case of the missing son-in-law for General Sternwood and not even asking or accepting a tip or bonus for doing it , from a grateful Charlotte , Philip Marlow hops in his expensive car and drives as fast as he can out of Sternwood Manor . Marlow in his speedy exit breaks a number of speed limits on the way out as he tries to get his head back together after what he had to go through in solving the case .

( There are Spoilers ) End of the human race via a deadly and unstoppable infectious disease or virus is the storyline of the the made for TV thriller " Carriers " . Were told that a US military / industrial operation for the US Army involving the drug company Gensystems got involved in a top-secret biological research experiment that suddenly went berserk when it . The by-product of the experiment , was introduced to the public as a fertility drug . One of the scientists working on this drug Jonathon Parker , Berry Bell , unwitting gave it to his wife Holly , Pamala Reed , to increase her chances of getting pregnant who eventually gave birth to twins two normal and healthy girls Alex & Lucy , Elke Larson & Kylie Larson , who were born with the virus in their systems .

The Black Cat is actually Gray and White !	SPOILERS Not at all the Perry Mason of Raymond Burr TV fame Perry is played by the witty eloquently sophisticated and most of all , unlike Mr . Burr , thin Ricardo Cortez . Perry get's involved in a case defending murder suspect Douglas Keene , Carlyle Moore Jr , at the assistance of his fiancé Wilma Lexter , Jane Bryan ; Wilma is the grand-daughter of Peter Laxter , Harry Davenport , one of the three persons who ended up as murder victims in the movie . Perry also becomes the attorney of record of this screeching and annoying cat named Clicker who's owner Laxter's caretaker Ashton , George Rosner , is worried that one of his employers relatives will kill Clicker just to shut him up so that he can finally get some sleep . There's far more to the movie then Clicker but it's the crazy cat who unwitting set's off a series of events that lead to two murders and the abduction of the body of hobo Watson Clammert . Clammert is to be used as a substitute for the load mouth and grouchy Peter Lexter who got wind that one of his many close , to his money , relatives were planning to kill him knowing that he'll change his will leaving everything over to the cat . Having Perry come over to re-write his will later that evening at the Lexter Mansion it suddenly burns down with a body burned beyond recognition found in the rubble . Later Perry finds out that the day before the fire Lexter had converted all his stocks and bonds into cash , a cool million dollars , that mysteriously disappeared . Asking the police coroner to exhume Lexter's body to see if in fact he did die in the fire it's found out that he was actually dead hours before and that the fire was just a cover . It later turned out that the persons who set the Lexter Mansion on fire had no idea that not only was whoever they thought was Lexter was already dead . Lexter himself planned his own murder , by them , in order t catch his killers flat-footed in the act of trying to murder him . What makes the movie really work is that the last ten minutes or so we get a flashback of what really happened . The flashback connects not only old man Peter Lexter but his nurse Louise DeVoe , Nedda Harrigan , and caretaker and owner of Clicker the Cat , Ashton , to the killing . The ten minute on flashback helped explain a lot of the very complicated plot , through Perry's courtroom monologue , that tied all the lose ends together and made an almost impossible to follow murder mystery easily understood . Laxter played his cards right by tricking those who were just about to do him in to expose themselves . It was their greed in not only wanting to grab Lexter's missing million but getting their hands the valuable Koltsdorf Diamond necklace that Laxter together with his caretaker Ashton secretly hid . It turned out that it was Clicker , or one of his feline relatives , who by his wild and crazy antics provided the clue that not only broke the murder case wide open by in effect marking the killer , thus making it easy to identify , by Perry Mason , him .

Shadow Play	SPOILERS We first get to see pretty blond psychologist Dr . Sarah Taylor , Rebecca De Mornay , interviewing her favorite mental patient convicted serial murder and sex fiend Max Cheski , Harry Dean Stanton . Max seems to be far more knowledgeable in the science of multiple personalities then even Sarah is even though she's supposed to be the expert in these matters . It's much later in the film that we begin to realize how right Max was in that he's suffers from a multiple personality complex himself ! Sarah later gets involved with ex-cop Tony Ramirez , Antonio Banderas , whom she met in the wine department of her local supermarket . Tony a guy who can't take no for an answer sweep the icy blond off her feet and within hours the two have a sizzling as well as kinky affair at Tony's loft apartment . The affair between Sarah and Tony gets under the skin of Sarah's boyfriend Cliff Raddison , Dennis Miller , who in how he handles himself may be in need of psychiatric treatment , like Sarah's patients , himself . The movie gets even more confusing when Sarah's father Henry Taylor , Len Cariou , unexpectedly shows up wanting to crash her place , because he doesn't have money for a hotel room , for the Christmas Holiday's . Henry has been estranged from his daughter since her mother died in a car smash-up when she was a little girl . It soon becomes evident that the circumstances of Sarah's mothers death are not exactly as her father told her in fact she was at the scene and made , through brainwashing , to forget the whole thing ! As we soon learn it was Sarah's mothers death that was the reason that got her interested in becoming a psychologist in the first place ! It's when Sarah starts to get strange packages sent to her , one with the dismembered body of her pet cat Sam , that she starts to suspect that Tony , whom she's now having a stormy relationship with , is behind them .

It's when ex-boyfriend Cliff gets the hell beat out of him by a masked assailant that Sarah finally suspects , if she didn't already , that Tony is responsible for all the terror that she now finds herself engulfed in . SPOILER ALERT What Sarah didn't realize is that her troubles are a lot closer to home then she could ever have imagined ! Nothing special in this Alfred Hitchcock-like thriller with the exception of the typical icy blond , Sarah Taylor , really heating up the screen in her almost X-rated acrobatics with Tony Rameiriz . Something that even the " Master " , Alfred Hitchcock , would more then hesitate in putting into his films !
I'm Screwed !	SPOILERS The movie " Disclosure " is more about corporate climbing and back-stabbing then sexual harassment like your made , by it's advertising campaign , to believe it is . There's the handsome and personable , as well as highly competent , head of manufacturing at the giant computer chip company Digicom Tom Sanders , Michael Douglas , being passed up for the vice president slot at the company for the very sexy and conniving head of operations Meredith Johnson , Demi Moore . Were informed very early in the film by Tom , to his fellow employees , that he and Meredith had a very serious sexual relationship years ago before he married his wife Susan , Corline Goodell , which makes Tom even more upset that his former lover will now be his boss at Digicon . Swallowing his pride and taking the whole thing , his being passed up for promotion , in stride Tom sees nothing suspicious in being invited by his new boss Meredith to her pad after work to discuss business matters . Before he can get to the bottom line of the weekly profit report Tom ends up being attacked set upon and almost raped by a very wild and aggressive Meredith , acting like a young filly in heat , that has him run for his life out of her apartment , almost tripping over himself , with his pants still hanging down to his knees . Back at work the next day Tom , who was willing to put the whole sordid episode with Meredith behind him , is slapped with a sexual harassment suit by Meredith which can not only cost him his job but his marriage and reputation and make him virtually unemployable in the computer software business . Trying to fight off Meredith's suit Tom counter-sues which if made public will prevent a planned merger of Digicom with Colney Electronics that will raise the company's stock price value to over 100 million dollarsThe stakes being too high for Digicom president Bob Garvin , Donald Sutherland , to ignore gives him two option in dealing with Tom and that's either to farm Tom out to his new plant in Austin Texas which will completely disrupt his , and his wife Susan and two children , life here in Seattle or just plain fire him with the stigma of being a sexual predator where he'll be unable to get a job anyway in the computer software business in a managerial , or any other , position . Having a hearing on his counter-suit , as well as Meredith sexual harassment suit against him , Tom exposed his accuser as being a very manipulative and driven young woman who uses her looks to entice and then destroy , like a black widow spider , those she feels are a threat to her or in her way , like Tom , from climbing to the very top . Tom really gets a big lift in his hard fought efforts to exonerate and free himself from the tight and suffocating strangle hold that Meredith has on him when he recovers a tape that was made when he called , or miscalled , someone from work Mark Lewyn , Dennis Miller , to confirm his meeting with his boss just seconds before the out of control , and hot to trot , Meredith assaulted him at her suite that recorded an X-rated ten minute blow by blow description of the entire shocking incident . It's then when you , and Tom , realize the real purpose behind Meredith's strange and bizarre behavior and it doesn't have at all to do with Tom's sexy goods looks , which must have come as a big shock and disappointment to him , but with him being in the position of exposing her even more stranger managerial habits and activities back at the Digicom main computer chip plant in Kuala Lumpur Malasya the year before that is now costing the company tens of millions of dollars , in lost revenue from defective computer chips , that the sneaky Meredith want's to have the unsuspecting Tom take the blame for but first she has to get him fired so he won't have access to the company's files and records to prove his innocence and at the same time Meredith's guilt . Somewhat decent , but very complicated , movie about the movers and shakers in the top positions of cooperate America and how they use their power and influence , and in the case of Meredith Johnson her very sexy body , to get ahead and stay on top using all the assets available to them to keep up and coming young hot-shots as well as those senior executives over them from unseating and preventing them from reaching and staying on their high perch in the company that their employed at .
Rabid	( Spoiler Alert ) Like a hungry leopard totally focused on his pray we see at the beginning of the film " Pursued " corporate recruiter Vincent Plamer , Christian Slater , zero in on his helpless victim business executive John Blakely , Kevin McNulty , and get him to join the firm that he's being employed by . Blakely was forced to quit his family business , and let it go bankrupt , by Plamer blackmailing him in his wife's death whom he murdered . Now working for Seattle high-tech giant Resdat who's CEO William Carey , Andrew Stevens , gives Palmer a million dollars and instructions to tear top executive Ben Keats , Gil Bellows , away from the up and coming chemical company Viztrak . The company is about to release a low-jack-type formula that when ingested can track down lost children missing persons pets or escaped criminals anywhere on earth . Plamer at first tries to get Bellows to quit Viztrak and take over the management of Carey's company by offering millions in salary and stock options . Still Bellows want's nothing to do with Carey or his firm Resdat feeling obligated and being loyal to the owner of Viztrak Franklin , Michael Clark Duncan , who he looks up to as a father figure and well as his good friend and employer . It's when he feels that money can't reel Bellows in that Plamer turns obsessive pestering and harassing not only Ben Bellows but his wife Emily , Estella Warren , and even his young daughter Alison , Conchita Campball , night and day on the phone ! I started to wonder just how much Plamer's monthly cell-phone bill was ? in the thousands ? Plamer also goes as far as trying to split up the workers at the Viztrak firm by planting rumors that Bellows was leaving it for Resdat . Plamer even plants bugs in Bellows home office and even car to get all the info he can on him driving the poor man almost out of his mind . Getting the confidential information , by having a bug planted in his home on Viztark's CEO Franklin's inoperable brain tumor Plamer sneaks into his mansion and shoots him to death leaving a suicide note , and gun in Fanklin's hand , blaming Bellows actions of leaving his company for driving him to kill himself . At Franklin's funeral Plamer shows up inciting Bellows , who instinctively knew that he was behind Franklin's murder not suicide , to attack him . Which put the hysterical Bellows in the county jail and right where Plamer wanted him ; to sign on the dotted line and join Carey's company Resdat if Bellows wants him to drop all charges . The ending of the movie " Pursued " is a bit of a let-down with Bellows and his friend and corporate fraud expert Robert Langford , Scott Hyland , tricking Plamer into drinking the Viztrak formula and thus be able to track down his movements in order to trap him in committing a felony . That would put Plamer away from pestering people like Bellows , and is family , once in for all . It was hard to believe that Palmer could have gotten away with his sleazy activities all this time and not once be set up and caught by the local police and those he was victimizing . You also also why Bellows never went to the police to report him in the first place ? Plamer himself was so boastful about his underhanded actions , including the murder of John Blakely's wife , that all it would have taken was for the police to check up on his past criminal adventures that he so openly bragged about ! Plamer even bragged about his crimes when he was pressuring Bellows in jail , where the walls have ears , in order to get him to join the chemical firm Resdat or end up behind bars himself .
The Perfect Husband	The made-for-TV film is very faithful in retelling of the story of what happened back in 2002-2005 in the murders of Laci Peterson and her unborn son Connor and the trial that followed of her husband Scott . It turned out that Scott was cheating on Laci as far back as a month before she disappeared the day before Christmas 2002 . Having a relationship with physical therapist Amber Frey Scott bragged to Amber that he's a very successful fertilizer salesman . Scott boastfully tells Amber that he spreads the stuff , horse manure , all over the world in order to impress the single mother . What in fact Scott was spreading was a whole line of BS . In real life Scott was a part-time waiter and collage student with a wife and soon to be born child whom he could barley support with his meager income . Thinking that Scott was single Amber is shocked to find out from her girlfriend Carol , who introduced Scott to her , that he in fact is married . Scott knowing just what buttons to push get's Amber back on track , and on his side , tearfully telling her that his poor wife in fact died , he doesn't say how , about a year ago . This BS story on Scott's part falls completely apart when Amber , who never watches the TV News , accidentally happens to see Scott on TV when he was supposed to be traveling all throughout Europe selling his brand of high quality horse manure . Scott is seem by the hurt and surprised Amber begging the public to help him in finding his wife Laci who mysteriously disappeared during the Christmas holidays ! You would think that by now Amber , who's very sensitive in being lied to , would have dropped that lying bum Scott Peterson , and never had anything to do with him again , instead she gets even more involved with him . That's when the local Modesto Police have Amber try to trap Scott , by recording his cell-phone calls to her , in having him admit that he , now the prime suspect , was the person who did both Laci and the unborn Connor in . Laci together with Connors bodies were found in the waters outside the Berkeley Marina on April , 2003 . You have to tell yourself that this Scott Peterson is either the stupidest or the most clever killer in the history of crime . The guy keeps calling Amber over and over up to and even after his trial for murder began knowing , how could he have not , that she's recording both his and her conversations ! Never in any of the dozens of calls he makes to Amber does Scott as much admit that he murdered his pregnant wife Laci . I feel that Scott knowing that his calls are being recorded wanted to put off the cops in thinking that he was guilty of the crime . Why else would he do something so ridicules unless he wanted everyone , the cops listening in as well as Amber and later the media , to think that he's just a poor innocent schmuck who has nothing to hide in his wife's murderer ? Amber for her part gets support from Laci's mom Sharon Rocha and step-dad Ron Grantsky who saw , after struggling with their consciences , what a low life creep their son-in-law Scott really is . It's the support of Laci's family , far more then the hot to get Scott Peterson police , that in the end gave Amber the strength and courage that he needed to get on the witness stand . It's there that Amber looked her ex-lover straight in the eye telling Scott , and a packed courtroom , what exactly she thought of him and it wasn't pretty . We'll never really know for sure what was the reason , now that he's been convicted of it in a court of law , why Scott Peterson murdered his wife . Scott always maintained his innocence all throughout the trial and even after his conviction . The evidence that sent Scott Peterson on a one way trip to San Quentin's death row was circumstantial at best with him never as much as admitting or even hinting that he murdered his pregnant wife Laci . It was Scott's former lover Amber Frey's testimony more then the not so incriminating police undercover audio tapes that convinced the jury to convict him . Amber's brave decision to face the public in her involvement with Scott , that at one point had her suspected in being his accomplice in Laci's murder , that in the end put him behind bars . Amber's court testimony also showed how she did it not just out of a sense of justice , in Scott murdering his wife , but betrayal as well . The betrayal of Amber and her feelings for Scott in what the scheming heel did to her . In Scott using Amber as an alibi and human shield in his failed efforts to escape ultimate justice .
Words to Music	SPOILERS " Dressed to Kill " is the 14th and last installment of the Universal Sherlock Holmes series with Basil Rathbone as the famous English detective and Nigel Bruce as his bumbling and butterfingered sidekick . Sherlock Holmes gets on the case of the missing and mysterious music boxes , one of three , when one of his friends , Julian " Stiky " Emery , ends up dead with the music box he just bought at an auction stolen . The three music boxes were made by convicted counterfeiter John Davidson . Davidson stealing the engraving British five pound plates from the Bank of England had them haphazardly hidden them and is afraid that they'll be discovered before he gets out of prison to retrieve them . Trying to get in touch with his fellow crooks on the outside , Hilda Courtney Col . Cavanaugh and the colonel's chauffeur Hamid , Davidson has the music boxes sent to a London auction house that handles and sells goods produced by convicts , like himself , at the British Dartmouth Prison . With Davidson's confederates getting to the auction house too late to buy the music boxes they now set out to track down those who did murdering them , if necessary , to get the boxes back . Racking his brains out to figure out just what the music boxes , they all play the same tune , has to do with finding the missing British five pound plates Holmes deducts that all three tunes , even though exactly the same , are a bit off key ! That's the key in finding out where the valuable Bank of England plates are . Having retrieved just one of the three boxes , the Cavanaugh Gang had the other two , Holmes knows from decoding the music in what place the plates are hidden . Holmes needs to follow the Cavanaugh Gang to find just where that place is . More physical then brainy Sherlock Holmes gets kidnapped by the hoods and later escapes from being gassed to death in a sealed car garage . Holmes in the movie does a bit of advanced aerobatics instead of his trademark elementary intelligence . Sherlock Holmes even guns down one of the bad guys at the end of the movie but it was really the klutzy Dr . Watson who broke the case of " The Missing Music Boxes " wide open without even realizing it .
Itch for Scratch	( SOME SPOILERS ) Effective low budget crime flick with Walter Matthau , Jack Martin , both staring as well and directing . Escaping form being extradited at the airport Jack Martin gunned down two lawmen and goes into hiding in a downtown hotel . Getting his priorities in order Martin devises a plan to rob the local bank using the excuse to the police that he's doing a movie about a bank robbery and the bank president is staring in it . The cops just stand outside the bank , hoping to be in Martin's movie , and watch Martin pull off the robbery not realizing that it's the real thing . Mob kingpin Earl Dawson , Bruce MacFarland , is outraged that the bank robbery was pulled off without him having anything to do with it as well as not getting a percentage of the loot . Dawson is also mad that the robbery took place in his mob controlled territory and he'll be blamed for something that he had nothing to do with . Finding that Martin is at the racetrack laundering the stolen money Dawson has two of his hoodlums track him down but Martin outsmarts them and ends up blowing the two away . it's also during this time Martin got to know and become very friendly Carol , Carol Grace , a local librarian whom he met when he was running from the police . Figurings out that if you can't beat him let him join your organization Dawson sends Martin a peace feeler and offers him to join his mob with just his second in command Adolph , Garry Walberg , being the only person , besides himself , who gives Martin orders . Martin quickly becomes a sensation in the world of crime pulling off a string of daring robberies that result in millions of dollars going into he coffers of the Dawson Mob . Martins masterpiece being the rip off of the impregnable Meadow Lark Country Club . It's there where the biggest bookie operation in the state the Gordon Bookmaker Syndicate works out off . Getting together a number of Dawson's men , including Adolph , Martin pulls off the Meadow Lark caper but only himself and Adolph survives the shoot-out with the police at a highway road block . Back home with Carol Martin is told by her that she's leaving him if he doesn't quit his life of crime and the Dawson Mob . Agreeing with Carol Martin decides to tell Dawson that he's through with him and is going to retire together with Carol to Mexico . Mad as hell at Martin for quiting on him Dawson later tells Adolph to rat him out to the FBI and see to it that he never makes it across the border . Adolph who owes his life to Matin , for saving him from getting shot and killed by the highway cops , has second thoughts about ratting him out to the feds . After tipping off the FBI about his , and Carol's planned escape , Adolph calls Martin and tells him that his former boss Earl Dawson had tried to double-cross him . With Carol driving to Mexico Martin tells her that he'll meet her there the next day but what he really intends to do is to pay Dawson a surprise visit . A bit tongue in cheek with Mattau being more funny then serious in the film as he seems almost invisible in his many crime exploits . Matthau , or Jack Martin , goes on robbing banks and gunning down policemen all throughout the movie yet he seems to be almost unrecognizable to the police and people in town who don't even bother to give him a second look in the movie .
The horrors of wartime occupation	SPOILERS The movie " 2 , 000 Women " has to do with ex British showgirl and Paris night club singer Rosemary Brown who ends up becoming a nun after she broke up her cheating , on his wife , boyfriend's marriage . Now arrested by the French police as the German Army advances into France in the late spring of 1940 Rosemary is thrown into prison as a suspected German spy ! It's later in the movie when Rosemary , after being freed from a French prison cell by the Germans , is sent to the German womens internment camp in Marneville France that things start to turn around for Rosemary as her , and her fellow 2 , 000 women internee's , live the kind of life that one can only dream about . Having all the convenience of living under stressful wartime conditions Rosemary and her fellow British women prisoners need only one thing to keep them from going crazy from boredom and that's a handsome and willing young man ! And a British one at that ! Not that the Nordic and Aryan looking German soldiers at the Marneville detention camp are not attractive ! For the patriotic English girls to have any kind of relationships with their German captors , as the British lads are on the front lines getting shot at , was considered by them to be an act of treason against the British Crown ! It's no too long when , like manna from heaven , three RAF bomber pilots and gunners parachute into Marneville to the delight of the man hungry women living there . Despite wanting to be with a man , a British man , more then anything else in the world the love starves British woman do everything possible to get the boys , who'd rather be there at Marneville then anywhere else , out safe and back to England even at the cost of their , and the fly-boys , lives ! More of a comedy then a war propaganda movie " 2 , 000 Women " has the hapless German soldiers at the womens detention camp get screwed at every turn in the film . These fearless and indestructible Nazi Supermen are so incompetent in keeping the women , looking like they just stepped out of Cosmopolitan Magazine , in line that you wonder how they at one time , in late 1942 , were very seriously on the brink of winning WWII ! Things almost backfire on the women's plan to get the fliers out safely to England when woman detainee , and Rita Hayworth look-alike , Birdie Johnson is caught by her fugitive , from the German Gestapo , RAF Canadian boyfriend Davy Kennedy alone in her room with German Army Sergeant Hentzner . Not knowing that Birdie was only using the love sick Sgt . Hentzner to get her tea bags and nothing else Davy blew a fuse and ended up strangling him to death ! As you would expect in movies like these , made to lift wartime moral , Sgt . Hentzner in fighting for his very life not only failed to use his gun to defend himself from the disarmed Davy , who gave him every chance to discharge it , but also failed to open his mouth and scream for help with hundreds of fellow German soldiers within yards of coming to his rescue ! SPOILER ALERT In the end the boys , the RAF men , are snuck out of Maneville by car as the girls , or women , distract the entire German Army stationed there with a song and dance as well as strip tease act . This has the Germans more interested in what's going on the stage then what going on , with the RAF men escaping , right under their noses ! I kept wondering as the film so abruptly ended where exactly were the three RAF men going with the Germans controlling all the roads and highways leading to the English Channel which is their only avenue of escape ? Wouldn't it have been far better for them just to stay at Marneville , with the 2 , 000 gorgeous and man hungry women , for the remainder of the war ! With the Germans there so incompetent in doing their jobs there's no way they would have noticed them being there in the first place !
Here we go again ! Another killer psycho-wearing a hockey mask-on the loose slasher flick !	SPOILERS Not that bad of a rip off of " Friday the 13th " , with a little of " Halloween " and " The Texas Chainsaw Massacre " thrown in for good measure . " Bloody Murder " has a bunch of teenage camp counselors at camp Placid Pines victimized , and murdered , by a masked nut-case running around in the woods with a chainsaw while dressed in-what looks like-car mechanic overalls . You at first have the feeling that all this murder and carnage is only in the imagination of the people victimized by it . Even though a number of camp counselors are brutally murdered within the first half hour of the film it's done in such a hap hazard , and unconvincing , manner that the killings come across as it their part of some kind of dream sequence and not at all reality based . We're also given clues to just who this masked killer , at the very beginning of the film , really is : The legendary Trevor Moorehouse . Moorehouse we're told is a deranged psycho who's been roaming the woods outside Camp Placid Pines for years slashing , with his chainsaw , anyone who got in his way . What Moorehouse's reasons are for doing all that is left very unclear in the movie . The closes I can come to understand Moorehouse's bizarre behavior is that somehow he was mistreated by the camps , Placid Pine , counselors and fellow campers when he was a young boy and is now taking his anger out on society ! Of all the characters in the film the one I found most interesting was that of the chubby and grossly out of shape local Sheriff Williams , Michael Prohaska . Williams who's been stationed in and around Camp Placid Pines since it came into existence seemed to be totally oblivious to what was going on around there now as well as over the years . Were told that during that span of time the masked psycho Trevor Moorehouse had murdered dozens of people . The Sheriff has such a bulging-looking like woman just about to give birth-stomach that's probably from the result of too many Big Mack's and Quarter Pounders-with cheese-that I waited-in vain - for him to finally tilt over and fall flat on his face ! The fact that he didn't defied the very laws and long proved theories of Newtonian psychics ! The usual surprise , which was no surprise at all , and twist ending to the film was so predictable that in fact you would have been totally surprised if it didn't happen at all !
An Ye Shall Wax Mightily	SPOILERS Having elderly music store owner Edward Stillwell , Paul E . Burns , show up at what you would expect to be , from watching Sam Spade & Philip Marlow like 1940's private eye flicks , his rundown and barley lit office in what looks like swanky Sutton Place , check out the 59th Street Bridge outside the office window , private investigator Don Gale , Richard Dix , is anything but interested in taking up his case . Stillwell is willing to pay Gale all his life saving , $100 . 00 , to track down and find 21 year-old Elora Lund , Pamela Blake , whom he hasn't seen or heard from for almost seven years . It's when Stillwell tells the very uninterested Gale that Miss . Lund is to inherit a large amount of money that her widowed mother , who had just passed away , left with him that Gale suddenly got interested in the case knowing that he'll , if he finds Miss . Lund , get a piece of it . The movie " Mysterious Intruder " is a lot like the " Maltese Falcon " with an unscrupulous private eye , like Sam Spade in the latter , breaking every rule in the book trying to get his hands on , instead of the legendary " Black Bird " , a set of 1887 wax recordings cylinders of Swedish Nightingale Jenny Lind worth over $200 , 000 . 00 . Gale is in fact a lot more unscrupulous then Sam Spade ever was by using people to trick poor old Mr . Stillwell into getting hold of the wax recordings without even giving them to their rightful owner Elora Lund ! Gale using one , of many , of his lady friends hot blond Freda Hanson , Helen Mowery , to impersonate Miss .

If we run we'll let those monsters ruin our lives !	( SOME SPOILERS ) True story of a vicious kidnapping of a couple and their infant daughter by two on the run drug addicted psycho's . Moving to the quaint and picturesque little town of Yachats Oragon the Plunks , Paul & Kathy , expected to get away from the big city crime that they just left in Tucson Arizona only to find out that no place is safe in the country and learning it the hard way . Opening a motel the very first customers Jeff Frost & Robert Knotts , who had just pistol whipped and carjacked an elderly couple , rob the place and hold Kathy and her baby daughter Katie hostage until Paul shows up taking him hostage as well . Needing cash the two criminals have Kathy go down to the local town bank to withdraw $9 , 000 . 00 from her , and Paul's , bank account . With that done Knotts decides to take the entire Plunk family along with him as his partner Frost , across the Oragon / Washington border . It turns out to be a crazy ride to nowhere ending in a wild shootout with the police . The movie " Captive " focus more on the aftermath of the Plunk's kidnapping then the kidnapping itself and how it effected the two crime victims , as well as little Katie . Paul had to suffer the humiliation of having his wife raped before his eyes , with little Katie on the scene , and being unable to do anything to stop it . Kathy for her part felt guilty for being concerned and sympathetic , shades of the Stockholm Syndrome , for one of her kidnappers , Jeff , who ended up getting killed in a police shoot out . This while and his partner Knotts kidnapped two more innocent motorists . Kathy is also later counseled by police trauma expert Karen in getting over the fact that she may have caught Aids from being raped by the two drug addicted thugs as well as being impregnated by them , she didn't and she wasn't . Jeff for his part wasn't as " innocent " as Kathy may have thought at first with him , like Knotts , raping her right in front of her husband and little Katie . The last twenty or so minutes of the movie " Captive " had to do with the Plunk's trying to get their lives back together , that was shattered by their experience with the two kidnappers . That was more painful for them then the kidnapping and the brutality , Paul was also thrown out of his van and left to freeze to death , they suffered at the hands of Frost & Knotts . The movie ends on a comical note with Knotts ' lawyer wanting the Plunk's to be a character witness for him at his upcoming trial . When holding the Plunk's captive Paul & Kathy promised Knotts that they'll give him a job as night clerk at their motel in order to humor him . It was that absurd suggestion that broke the ice and had the Plunk's , Paul & Kathy , realize that they had to put what happened to them , at the hands of Knotts & Frost , behind them once and for all and get back to a normal life . A bit uneven but still penetrating movie about crime and the effect it has on people who were traumatized by it long after it's over .
The title character upon which this story is based on is true .	( Some Spoilers ) Early Roger Corman AIP collaboration that comes across pretty good with a cool jazzy score by Gerald Fried . We find out right away that this killer of a gangster George " Machine Gun " Kelly , Charles Bronson , is anything but a killer when he freezes at the sight of a bouquet of flowers at a local Lebanon funeral home . This happens at the start of the movie when Kelly and his gang are about to knock off a bank . Ripping off $41 , 000 . 00 in the bank robbery the gangs pick-up man Mike " Fanny " Fandango , Morey Amsterdam , takes $6 , 000 . 00 for himself before Kelly and his gang have time to split up the take . Outraged at Fanny's two-timing Kelly later , after working him over , has Fanny served up for lunch to a caged mountain lion who ends up ripping off his left arm . It's this act of unnecessary violence that in the end , according to the movie , has Fanny turn against Kelly which leads to his retirement as a big time gangster . Kelly ends up spending the remainder of his life in federal prisons like Alcatraz and Leavenworh dying behind bars on July 18 , 1954 which just happened to be Kelly's 59th birthday . Kelly is depicted , very accurately like he was in real life , in the movie " Machine Gun Kelly " as a cowardly bully who pushed people around only when the odds , and guns , were all in his favor . It's later in the movie during another attempted robbery in the small Oklahoma town of Elizabeth Kelly once more screws up . Kelly panicked when he sees a coffin being delivered to a funeral home , they always seem to pop up at the wrong time for Kelly in the movie , which in the series of events that follows cause his wheel-man Maize , Wally Campo , to end up getting shot to death after a wild car chase . Howard , Jack Lambert , who was in the bank when Kelly , who was to help him rob it , chickened out escaped . Later Howard and his gang ended up being massacred by a pumped up Kelly who ambushed them playing poker at their hideout . It took Kelly's gun moll Flo Becker , Susan Cabot , to get the wimpy hoodlum to get his courage back by taunting him in what a gutless coward he really was . Hiding out from the police at Flo's mom's Ma ' Becker , Connie Gilchrist , home Kelly dreams up a new scheme in making big bucks without the dangers of robbing banks ; kidnapping . This new criminal adventure on Kelly's part at first seemed to be paying dividends with Kelly & Flo grabbing little nine year old Sherry Vito , Lori Martin , as she and her nurse or nanny Lynn Gryson , Barboura Morris , were coming home from school . Contacting Sherry's dad Mr . Andrew Vito , Robert Griffin , Kelly wants $100 , 000 . 00 in cash from him as ransom if he ever wants to see his daughter again . As you would expect by now in the movie the not too bright Kelly screws up . Having again recruited the now one armed , because of Kellys actions , " Fanny " Fandango to be his pick-up man Fanny instead , in revenge to what Kelly did to him , snitches Kelly together with his partners in crime Flo and the equally one-armed Harry , Frank DeKova , out to the police ! Fanny also proved to be as brainless as his reality-challenged boss George Kelly by bragging , as the cops were closing in on Kelly's and Flo's hideout , that he sold him out ! Whatever happened to Fanny next , getting his brains blown out from behind , had nothing to do with Machine Gun Kelly who was too chicken to do anything with the cops and FBI men shooting up the place . A terrified Kelly ended up cowering in a corner and weeping like a little boy as the lawmen finally put the cuffs on him and took this poor excuse of a gangster . Unlike the legendary hoods of that time , Dillinger Pretty Boy Floyd and Bonnie and Clyde , George " Machine Gun " Kelly lived to eventually die in bed not in a blazing shootout with the local police or FBI Agents . Kelly's who life as a fearless gunslinging , with his tommy gun , gangster was all a myth made up by his gun moll and partner in crime Flo Becker . It's suspected that it was Flo , a member of the weaker sex , who really did most off the bank jobs that Kelly was credited with in the newspapers . This was done by Flo to build up her boyfriends image who in return smacked her around every chance he got . Even Kelly's working Flo over was sissy-like in him , not being a Jack Dempsey or Joe Louis , not being able to even make a mark on Flo , who took it all in stride , no matter how hard he belted her . P . S One thing that you have to give George " Machine Gun " Kelly credit for is in him coining the word , referring to FBI Agents , G-Men . It was that word , " Please don't shoot me I give up G-Men " , that a scared to death George Kelly uttered as he was about to be arrest and put away for good as the " G-Men " busted into his hideout .

The key to all this is with Bob at he time in the casino gambling and being seen by hundreds of gamblers and tourists as well as the casino's battery of security cameras . This action on his part will provide Bob with an air tight alibi in not participating in the robbery . Far too complicated to go into details , without giving away the very clever surprise ending , " the Good Thief " has Bob pull off a real double whammy to the surprise of everybody watching , as well as in , the movie . Bob not just lowers the boom on the casino and the cops headed by Bob's good friend , who want's to see him go straight , Capt .

The crew that both Bob & Roul assembled included sex-changed , from a male to a female , bodybuilder the former Philip and now Philipe , Julien Maurel . Philipe's fear of spiders , something he or she keeps secret from the rest of the crooks , later almost blows the entire caper wide open . There's also the Judas , or rat-fink , that Bob covalently set up without his knowledge to throw the police off to what he was doing Algerian fugitive Said , Ouassini Embarek .

In his also trying to get in good with Anne , whom he supplies with dope , to find out Bob's plan Said didn't realize , until it was too late , that her boyfriend Paulo , Said Taghmauel , had a nasty and murderous jealous streak in him . The really big ace up Bob's sleeve in what turned out to be the perfect crime turned out to be the identical twins Albert & Bertram , Mark & Micael Polish . In an amazing final sequence the twins not only had Bob , together with Anne , pull off the crime of the century but have in done with a double indemnity clause tacked on to it as well ! P . S The song " A Thousand Kisses Deep " on the movie's soundtrack had me at first think that it was sung by non-other then it's foghorn voiced star Nick Nolte . The song in fact turned out to have been preformed by singer Leonard Cohen , who's voice is a dead ringer for Nolte's , instead !

Madness Reigns	SPOILERS Spine-tingling and mind-bending ride about madness and the macabre in this little known psycho-thriller aptly called " Madhouse " . Young college medical-student Clark Stevens , Joshua Lenard , gets a job at the state Cunningham Hall Mental Health Facility in order to get enough credits for his degree . Meeting the " Big Cheese " Dr . Franks , Lance Henriksen , who's in charge of the institution Steven starts to feel a bit unsettled about whats really going on there and , as Steven learns later , it has nothing to do with the curing of the patients there . Since Dr . Franks has been in charge of Cunningham Hall no patient ever recovered or was ever let out of the facility . Steven also finds that the people interned at Cunningham Hall were never given the strong and effective medication prescribed to them , to help them recover from their mental illness , but were given instead useless placebos by Dr . Franks and his staff . Striking up a friendship with Sara , Jordan Ladd , a fellow worker and medical student Steven finds out that she herself has a mental illness that at times effects her work and also endangers the patients that she's in charge of . Things start to get out of control when two of the workers at the institution end up being brutally murdered . Head Nurse . Hendricks , Dendrie Taylor , who's electrocuted and Dr . Morton , Leslie Jordan , who's chopped to pieces with an ax . There's also one of the patients Carl , Aaron Armstrong , who seemed to be recovering and was about to be released , the first patient released there in some 15 years , who ends up hanging himself . Steven also begins to notice some little boy running through the hallways and grounds of the institution . When it's found out that it's , the boy , probably his imagination Steven begins to feel that he's either going insane or that there are ghosts or spirits running loose at Cunningham Hall something that he never believe in . Slowly going insane Steven becomes involved with this mysterious patient , calling himself Ben , at the top-security section of the institution in whats called " Cell 44 " . It's then that he finally gets in his head just whats happening at the institution and to himself and it's something thats so unimaginable that it cause Steven not only to lose his mind but his ability to have any control of his actions . A bit too hard to follow at first " Madhouse " does have a cohesive plot thats a lot like the famous 1945 British horror film " Dead of Night " . The acting of Joshau Leonard Jordan Ladd and Lance Henricksen , in a small but very pivotal role as the mental facilities administrator , was a lot better then you would have expected in a B-movie like " Madhouse " . Some things in the movie were left a bit up in the air or unexplained like just who was Ben ? Was he for real or a figment of Stevens imagination or even Steven himself ? There was also the staff at the institution who were at times even more unstable then the patients they were treating ! Were they also patients allowed to act out their fantasies by the somewhat crazed and maniacal Dr . Franks ? All and all " Madhouse " is well worth watching if you want to see a movie that would not only scare the hell out of you but scare it back into you as well .
Leave the dead to their Maker	SOME SPOILERS Unusual movie with Boris Karloff that has him , playing ex-convict John Ellman , not as much as hitting much less killing anyone in it yet being responsible for the deaths of some half dozen men who framed the innocent Ellman for a murder that he didn't commit . With Steven Martin , Kenneth Harlan , having the book thrown at him for fraud and embezzlement Martin's fellow gangsters including his crooked lawyer Noland , Ricardo Cortez , plans to knock off the Judge who put him behind bars ; the Honorable Roger Shaw , Joe King . In finding a perfect pasty to do the job for them Nolan and his gangster friends come up with ex-convict John Ellman who was just released from prison . Ellman was sentenced by the Judge to ten years for the murder of a person whom he claimed he killed in self-defense . Having one of the mobsters Trigger Smith , Joe Sawyer , get friendly with the unemployed Ellman he gives him a job to check up on Shaw claiming that he's cheating on his wife and that he , Trigger Smith , is a private investigator hired by her to get the goods on the judge . Murdering Judge Shaw the mobsters then plant his body in Ellman's car and that just about clinches it for them in implicating Ellman in Shaw's murder . Just one thing unexpectedly went wrong with their plan . A couple was on the scene and saw the mobsters moving Judge Shaw's body into Ellman's car . That couple just happened to be Jimmy & Nancy , Warren Hall & Marguerite Churchill , who work for heart transplant pioneer Dr . Even Beaumont . The sleazy Noland volunteers to take on Ellman's case , free of charge , in order to secretly undermined it and do everything he can to put the poor and innocent man into the electric chair . Jimmy and Nancy at first not wanting to get involved change their minds on the eve of Ellman's execution . They together with Dr . Beaumont get in touch with Ellman's lawyer Noland to get the governor to stop his client's execution .

Dr . Beaumont getting Ellman's body from the prison morgue conducts an operation on it , that's the least he could do for him , using a new invention called the Lindberg Heart and miraculously brings the executed convict back to life .

It's those powers that gives him the ability to not only know what's in the hearts and minds of the men who railroaded him into the chair , Noland Trigger & co , but is also able to make them pay with their lives for doing it . A very sensitive and sympathetic Boris Karloff , who's a former concert pianist in the film , together with a somewhat selfish and scheming Edmund Gwenn , make the movie " The Walking Dead " somewhat of a novelty to watch . Very moving ending sequence with Karloff , or John Ellman , facing death for the second time in the movie . This time around not at all being afraid of what he'll find on the " outer side " since he's already been there before when he was executed . Ellman now knows that death is not the end but a new beginning in one's endless journey through the vast and unexplored universe of existence . As he and the movie comes to an end Ellman tells Dr . Beaumont just before he passes away that there nothing to fear in death ; it's only the gateway to a world that offers a peace and tranquility to those that enter it that they'll never find while alive and on earth .
Reality Check	SPOILERS Remade nine years later in 1956 as " Nightmare " with Kevin McCarthy and Edward G . Robinson " Fear in the Night " is a neat little thriller about a man who has a nightmare that seems too real and turns out to be more then just a figment of his imagination . Waking up in a cold sweat one morning at his room at the Commodore Hotel bank teller Vince Grayson , Deforest Kelly , realized that he has thumb marks , like he was being strangled , an his throat and blood on his hand as well as a strange key and a button in his coat pocket that was in his nightmare . Vince had a dream where he got into a fight with someone in what looked like a hall of mirrors . The man that Vince was fighting was handed a steel bore by the women in the dream with him but Vince grabbed it and stabbed the man to death . With his attacked dead Vince ran out of the hall of mirrors and blacked out ; it's then when he woke up in his hotel room . Eerie mystifying and frightening film about an innocent man who thinks that he murdered someone only to find out later that he was used by the real killer Lewis Belknap / Harry Byrd , Robert Emmett Keane . Belknap put Vince under hypnosis to get him to commit the murder , or murders , of his wife Mrs . Belknap , Janet Warren , and her lover Bob Clune , Michael Harvey . It was a murder that Belknap not only planned but manipulated Vince into thinking that he committing and then having him take he blame for it . Very unusual movie for that time , 1947 , about mind manipulation and murder and it comes off very well . Deforest Kelly , Vince Grayson , is the poor and innocent dupe who doesn't have a clue to what he did and how he did it and that confusion almost drives him to kill himself . Cliff Herlihy , Paul Kelly , is very effective as Vince's brother-in-law as well as police detective . Cliff at first suspects Vince of murder but as the facts slowly comes out realizes that there's more to what happened in the murder of Mrs . Belknap and Bob Clune then what Vince has been telling him . Later Vince being is again put under hypnosis by Lewis Belknap inducing him to kill himself by drowning and then leaving a suicide note confessing to Belknap's murders . That attempt by Belknap goes haywire with Cliff having the entire scheme , to frame Vince by Belknap , audio taped as evidence of his crime of where he had Vince kill Bob in self-defense . With Bob out of the way Belknap then ran down his wife in the driveway killing her . The ending with Belknap trying to get away from the police and having his back tire shot out and his car plunge down a gully to his death was about the only action scene in the movie . The mind games played by Lewis Belknap on Vince as well as the movie audience was more then enough to keep everybody watching interested .

Cleared by a court of inquiry in Medeleine tragic suicide Scottie , still holding himself responsible , becomes almost a recluse to his friends , which are very few , as well as society at large .

Obsessed to the point of being arrested and put in a mental ward for both observation and preventing him from both hurting himself or anybody else Scottie really loses it in the end . The bad news in the movie is that Scottie loses his chance to put his past behind him in what he did , or thought he did , in having Medeleine driven to kill herself . The good news is that Scottie in his mindless actions at the end of the movie did in fact put himself through his own kind of unique and very needed " Shock Treatment " . It was that self administrated " Shock Treatment " what in the end finally cured Scottie of his Vertigo !

Making a noise in this world	SPOILERS When he was ten years old Rudy Yellow Lodge , Eric Schweig , was stung by a deadly Trickster Spider that would have killed him if it wasn't for his older brother Mogie , Graham Greene . Who carried him to the hospital where the quick attention of the hospital staff saved Rudy's life . From then on young Rudy looked up to his brother Mogie and also felt that he owed him something to repay him for what he did . But as both brothers grew up Mogie , after coming back from the army in the Vietnam War , became a helpless alcoholic with nothing to look forward to but a government check to buy beer and wine . While Rudy became a policeman on the police department of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation where both Rudy and Mogie lived . The Pine Ridge Reservation is a depressing place , in the Black hills on the South Dakota Nebraska border With unemployment among the American Indians there at a whopping 75 % with alcoholism nine times higher and life expectancy some 15 years lower then anywhere else in America . This is where the story about the two brothers , Rudy and Mogie , takes place . Rudy trying to do what is beyond his authority as a lawman gives him takes the law into his own hands when a friend of his son , Cokie Red Tail , is murdered . Tracking down Cokie's killers one night , while they were drunk , Rudy breaks their kneecaps with a baseball bat as well as later puts them behind bars . One evening watching TV Rudy sees a news story about a liquor warehouse across the South Dakota border in Nebraska where the Indians of the Pine Ridge Reservation go to buy their booze which is illegal at the reservation .

Rudy it tears secretly tells his brother that he was the one who set the fire that almost killed him . But Mogie , to Rudy's great relief , took it quite mildly telling Rudy if he wanted to do something to show his outrage at what was happening to his people , the American Indians , why not stick something up George Washington nose on Mount Rushmore . All his sounded pretty stupid to Rudy even though what he did as a vigilante was a lot worse . Later with Mogie looking a lot better Rudy went down to the local hardware store and bought his brother a T-shirt with famous American Indians instead of famous American Presidents on Mount Rushmore knowing that Mogie would get a kick out of it . But when Rudy came back to the hospital room where Mogie was staying he saw his Aunt Helen , Lois Red Elk , and Mogie's son Herbie , Noah Watts , in tears and sadly Rudy knew what happened . Rudy was depressed not only by Mogie's death and by the guilt that he felt by what he did to Mogie by setting the warehouse on fire where Mogie was sleeping in . But by not repaying is big brother for saving his life when they were little boys . Rudy saw that there was only one thing that he could do to square things with his brother and that was what Mogie suggested to him just before he died . So one cold and early morning Rudy with a one gallon can of bright red paint drove down to Mount Rushmore and paid Uncle George a visit .
Lock & Load ! We're Going In !	SPOILERS Not at all that bad of a movie , if you see just how ridiculously entertaining it is , that has to do with this maniac colonel in charge of a giant ammo dump , Camp Benton , in the middle of the Nevada Desert that even includes nuclear weapons . We already see at the start of the movie " Breach of Conduct " a young woman , obviously the wife on a soldier at the base , die form an overdose of barbiturate's . We don't really realize why she did herself in until a bit later where we see that the commanding officer of the army post Col . Andrew Case , Peter Coyote . Col . Case is an absolute madman with delusions of grandeur who thinks that he's God's gift not only to women but to the future and safety of the United States of America as well . Having transfered from Ft Bragg to Camp Benrton the Lutz's Lt . Ted Lutz and his pretty wife Helen , Tom Verica & Courtney Thorne-Smith , never realized what they were in for with the commander of the base Col . Case who turned their lives , mostly Helen , into a living hell . Being mad as a hatter and all full of himself Col . Case got to Helen right away laying down the law , his law , to her that he and only he's the law of the land , or of Camp Benton . This militaristic lunatic soon demands that Helen do whatever he , his highness Andrew Case the all powerful supreme and exalted leader , tells her to do or else ! At first acting as if he just wants to be friendly Col . Case becomes almost unbearable towards Helen . Getting her husband Let . Ted Lutz transfered out of the base Col . Chase can now have his way with her without any interference from the outside world . Putting the screws on Helen by trying to get her to be his next military conquest , everything with this crazed lunatic has to do with war and military operations , Helen feels that the only way to survive this madman is to escape from the base . Helen is soon to find out it just isn't that easy with the colonel having the ammo dump under a total lock-up like a high security prison . Showing Helen his private pad , a reinforced steel and concrete bunker some 100 feet underground , that can withstand a direct hit from a thermonuclear explosion makes Helen finally realize that this guy is not only completely out of his head but a danger to her the men he commands and entire country . Now desperate in stopping this lunatic Helen tried to go through the proper channels to get him arrested and put away before he can cause any more damage that he already had . Col . Case running the entire camp as well as it's surrounding towns like a ruthless dictator has Helen instead of himself get arrested . Using a bogus medical report Col . Chase has Helen declared mentally unstable that lands her inside base hospital to be shot up with drugs and made into a mindless zombie that he could easily control . Helen escaping from the hospital and Col . Case's clutches with the help of the kindly and conscientious Cpl . Reed , Keith Amos , has the now totally nuts Col . Case go completely bananas . Running down Cpl . Reed with his command limousine killing him and then when Helen and her friend another army mans wife Paula ( Beth Toussaint ) , whom Col . Case also physically and sexually abused , take over Chase's command bunker he orders a massive military assault ! Chase's bizarre behavior shocked the soldiers under his command including the base doctor Dr . James , Tom Mason , who the insane Col . Case beats to within an inch of his life for disobedience . With no one , after the soldiers under his command mutinied , on the base left for him to command the hysterical Col . Case now armed to the teeth , and like Rambo , goes it alone to put an end to this disobedience and attack on his supreme and God-given authority , by two housewives ? To Col . Chase surprise he's soon to find out that he isn't exactly the super macho fighting man that he always envisioned himself to be . If you don't take this movie seriously you can really find it well worth watching as some kind of comedy about army or military life , like the TV shows Sgt . Bilko and F-Troop , which I feel that it was really intended to be but somehow along the way started to take itself seriously .
The Apartment	SPOILERS " Copkiller " or " Corrupt " does it's best to mix police corruption with a string of killing of " dirty cops " , who work for the plain clothes narcotic division of the NYPD , and comes out a bit uneven in the end . Narcotic plain clothes policemen are being murdered in New York City by this serial killer who dresses as a NYC policemen wearing a ski mask . The masked psycho kills the cops by slashing their throats with a long serrated knife . On the scene of one of the killers victims he left a phony police badge . While all this is going on we see NYC police Let . Fred O'Connor , Harvey Keitle , who's on " the take " with his partner police officer Bob Carvo , Leonard Mann , and who , together with Carvo , is living a double life . The two cops masquerade around as high living drug dealers at a $400 , 000 . 00 apartment overlooking Central Park . Everythings going well for the two plain clothes policeman until one afternoon when this weirdo Leo Smith , John Lydon , shows up at their apartment unannounced . O'Connor at first doesn't know what to make of this oddball since he feels that he somehow has " the goods " on him in his illegal drug dealings , together with his partner . How else could Leo have known about his and Carvo's secret apartment and the double lives that they lead ? Later on Let . O'Connor finds out that Leo comes from a very rich family who live in the town of Rhiencliff in upstate New York and is being looked for , as a missing person , by the entire police departments in both NYC & Rheincliff . Having him locked up in his apartment O'Connor goes up to Rhiencliff to see Leo's grandmother Margaret Smith , Silvia Sidney , on official business ; pretending that he's on the case to find her missing grandson . O'Conner also find an audio tape that Leo left there implicating him and his partner as corrupt cops . O'Connor feels that Leo , who told him about the tape in the first place , must have made other tapes as insurance to keep O'Connor from murdering him and making him disappear . The film then takes a turn where it's Leo not O'Connor who seems to be in control of the situation with O'Connor trapped in his own world of corruption and feeling that Leo had this planned all along . Later in an heated exchange between O'Connor and his partner Carvo at the apartment , over his treatment and confinement of Leo , O'Connor accidentally kills him and with Leo's help makes it look like Carvo was the victim of the police serial killer to throw the police off his trail . The movie starts getting even weirder when Leo tries to get O'Connor to murder Carvo's wife Lenore ( Nicole Garcia ) . Both Leo and O'Connor feel that Lenore had found about her husband and Let . O'Connor's corrupt activities and make their murdering her look like she killed herself . By now O'Connor is a totally destroyed man knowing that he was somehow manipulated by the clever Leo from the start . It's only a matter of time before the law , that he was sworn to uphold and enforce , will catch up with him and bring him before the bar of justice . It was both Harvey Keitel and John Lydon's performances that made the film " Copkiller aka Corrupt " well worth watching . The cat-and-mouse game between the manipulator and manipulated kept you glued to the screen until the ending credits and made you overlook the films many faults and inconsistencies .
You really scraped the bottom of the sewer to dig up your character witnesses didn't you !	SPOILERS Showing up in the little town of Grantville Kelly , Constance Towers , is determined to make a new start and throw away and forget her past as a hooker and call girl . On the run for two years from her slimy and mob-connected pimp Faraulde , Monte Mansfield , whom she beat up at the start of the movie all Kelly now want's is to live a normal and peaceful life in a place where nobody knows her . In the end fate was to intervene and bring her whole sordid past out into the open and with it change the peaceful and quite little town of Grantville and the people in it forever . Gtting off the bus Kelly is immediately recognized by the towns police chief Capt . Griff , Anthony Eisley , as a hooker ; " you can fool people with your face not with you body " Griff tells her . After making a play for her and spending the night with Kelly at his apartment Griff tells her she can get a Job as a " Bon-Bon Girl " across the river in the seedy and red light district of Delmar Falls at a night-club called Candy Ala Carte . Kelly feeling dirty for returning to her life as a hooker is now more determined then ever to shad her former occupation and instead gets a job at the local hospital as a nurses aid at the pediatric ward taking care of disabled children . Doing an almost miraculous job , with no former experience at all , Kelly get's the many children in the ward to be able to overcome their disability with a unique kind of tough love and understanding ; that astounds even the most senior doctors and nurses in the facility . It turns out that the good that Kelly does in Grandville is the very reason that Capt . Griff want's her out of there . Griff is very alarmed of the angelic Kelly turning the young and pretty girls in town , that he recruits into a life of sin , away from ending up as Bon-Bon and call girls at Candy's which Capt . Griff seems to be getting most of his illegal pay-offs from . Invited to a party at the towns favorite son's L . G Grant , Michael Dante , mansion L . G falls like a ton of bricks for the sweet and understanding Kelly after she opens up to him and tells L . G about her past as a hooker . Back a the hospital Kelly finds out that one of the nurses her friend Buff , Marie Devereux , is working at Candy's joint as a " Bon Bon Girl " . This leads an outraged Kelly to drop in there and after putting Candy , Virgina Gray , at ease thinking that she's looking for a job beats the living hell out of her . After working Candy over Kelly stuffs her mouth with the " dirty money " that she or her sleazy customers paid Buff for her service . It's Kelly's very actions in her cleaning up Grandville that leads to Capt . Griff to begin to blackmail her by threatening to bring out that she was a hooker to her now hopelessly in love fiancé L . G Grant . Kelly contemptuous of Griff's threats gives him the surprise of his life by not only telling him that L . G knows all about her past life but that he's been chosen by G . L to be the best man at their wedding ! It's when everything seemed to be going as smooth as silk that the whole world that Kelly created for herself as an upstanding and respected citizen in Grandville fell apart . That all happened when Kelly came to see her future husband one afternoon and found out to her shock and surprise what he really and secretly was ! It's L . J's sexual aberration that was the reason why he was so crazy about her in the first place . As the sick and perverted L . G tells Kelly " our marriage will be a paradises because were both abnormal " ! . Disgusted at her future husbands secret life leads Kelly , in a sudden flash of righteous indignation , to smash L . G's head in with a telephone receiver which killed him . Arrested and put in jail facing trial for murder all of the past that Kelly tried to hid from the public and herself comes to the surface . At her trial sleaze-balls like her former pimp Farlunde and that vindictive madam Candy come forth and spew dirty lies about her character to get even with Kelly for what she did to them . It's when everything looks hopeless for Kelly that the only person who could save her shows up and testified in her favor . The explosive and shocking testimony saves Kelly from spending the rest of her life behind bars for a crime that in the eyes of everyone in Grandville , including Capt . Griff , was fully justified . Samuel Fuller took a big chance in making " The Naked Kiss " knowing full well that it's subject matter was anything that the public back then in 1964 could fully accept digest and understand . The sick and secret life of L . G Grant was the first time that this mental perversion was ever brought out in a movie made in Hollywood . It was Fullers skillful directing and Constance Towers deeply emotional performance together with Michael Dante , as the sick and perverted L . G Grant , that makes " The Naked Kiss " as thought-provoking and effective now as it was back then .
When you dream you become a Night walker	Dark and spooky movie about murder and deception with a number of twists and turns to it that keeps you guessing until the very last frame . " The Night walker " is one of those films that doesn't seem to be what you at first think that it is ; Something between a horror and psychological movie . The movie skillfully goes from one side of of line to the other throughout it's almost entire time on the screen until that last ten or so minutes when you really see it for what it is and it's very effective in doing it . " The Night Walker " starts out like something out of the " Twilight Zone " or " One Step Beyond " with a very good prelude about the world of dreams and how we who dream becomes " Night Walkers " in them . Howard Trent , Hayden Rorke , is a blind millionaire who's suspicious of his wife Irene , Barbara Stanwyck . Howard thinks that Irene is cheating on him but all the evidence that he has is a number of audio tape recordings he secretly recorded in her bedroom while Irene was talking in her sleep . Howard tells his friend and lawyer Barry Moreland , Robert Taylor , how he feels about his wife Barbara at the start of the movie . You somehow at first think that it's Barry who's the man who having the affair with his Irene . It's seems that the blind but very cagey and clever Howard is manipulating both Barry and his wife Irene is some kind of sub-rosa plan that he's cooking up for them . A little later after Howard got into a fight with Irene he goes into his secret room where he keeps all of his audio equipment and tapes , as Irene runs out of the house , and the room suddenly explodes with him being blown to bits to where there's nothing left of Howard but molecules and atoms . With her husband dead and Irene now all alone in the house her dreams , or better yet nightmares , become more and more pronounced and real to the point where she has to leave the house in order to keep from going insane . Moving into a room at the back of a beauty shop that she owned now instead of her dreams stopping they become even more real to the point where she can't tell the difference between fantasy and reality . Irenes conjures up this " Dream Man " Lloyd Bochner , who appears to Irene at night . The " Dream Man " is so real that when he gets her to go out with him one evening to a chapel to get married the next day when Irene was driving with Barry through the city streets Irene recognizes the places that she went with her " Dream Man " ! Is Irene dreaming all this or is it real ? if it is real why and who is behind all this ? and even more if it's real what are the reasons for doing this ? Plays like a very good whodunit with Robert Taylor and Barbara Stanwyck giving the movie the attention and class that it wouldn't have gotten if it had much less known actors in those two top roles . The ending to the movie was not at all that contrived as if the screenplay was written only for shock value . The ending tried and succeeded in tying all the loose ends together and giving the film a satisfying instead of a confusing ending .
And Down The Stretch They Come !	( There are Spoilers ) Even though the movie " Thoroghbreds Don't Cry " is the first of many films pairing Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland as the most popular and admired teenagers on the silver screen in the late 1930's and 40's . The film instead comes across as being an early buddy-buddy like film about two at first combative then best of friends teenage boys horse-racing jockey Timmie Donovan , Mickey Rooney , and British blue-blood and all around nice kid Roger Calverton , Ronald Sinclair . Judy Garland is more or less overlooked by the two boys and almost everyone else in the cast in the small role as the sweet singing and piano playing Cricket West . The movie itself is a somewhat run of the mill story about a brash young man jockey Timmie Donovan who after he gets into a fight with the very proper and refined Roger Calverton , over his table manors , soon get's to become Rogers best friend . Timmie agrees to ride Roger's prized racehorse The Pookah in the biggest and richest race in California the California Cup . With young Roger's grandfather Sir . Peter Calverton , C . Aubrey Smith , and co-owner of The Pookah going along it's decided by Timmie that the horse needs a tune-up race before the Cup . It's than decided to run him in Ridgemore Handicap which The Pookah is expected to be an odds-on favorite . With both Timmie and The Pookah razor sharp for the Ridgemore the young jockey is summoned to his fathers Click , Charles D . Brown , bedside where he's told by the old man that he's dying from a very serious heart condition . Click gives the concerned Timmie this whole line of horse-sht about needing something like $5 , 000 . 00 so that he can have an iron-lung that would save his life . Click as well as his doctor " Doc " Godfrey , Henry Koker , tell Timmie that the only way he can get that kind of money is if he'll throw the race that he's to ride The Pookah in . Timmie who's as honest as the day , that's June 22 the beginning of summer , is long at first refuses to give into his dad's desperate plea but being the tender on the inside and tough on the outside guy that he is finally agrees to throw the race just to save his poor and sick father's life . It turns out that there's nothing at all wrong with the old man but that he and his gang of crooked gamblers , including " Doc " , are planning to bet heavily against The Pookah and make a killing at the expense of Timmie's career as a professional horse-racing jockey . Not letting The Pookah , who has a terrific closing kick , run in the Ridgemore Timmie loses the race and just after the horse crosses the finish-line finishing out of the money Old Man Calverton , shocked by the Pookah's loss , collapses in his private box of a heart-attack . At the hospital Timmie is told by the head nurse that the old guy didn't make it . Timmie get's so depressed over what he did that he becomes a homeless hobo sleeping on a bench in the park and asking for handouts so he can get himself a bite to eat . The ending is a bit unpredictable since you would think that Timmie in an effort to vindicate himself would ride The Pookah to victory in the California Cup . Instead Timmie is drummed out of his profession as a jockey by admitting to the race track official's , after his lousy and two-timing dad tipped them off , that he threw the previous race that he rode The Pookah in . Timmie in a round about way still does the right thing by getting , or stealing , the $1 , 000 . 00 entrance fee from his cheating dad to have The Pookah run in the big race . Since his friend Roger was not only broke but about to sell the horse to non-other then " Doc " who together with Timmie's sleazy father were planning to run the horse into the ground . Making as much money that they can off him until they finally , when The Pookah is an old and broken down nag , sell him to the glue factory . With him being suspended and not able to ride The Pookah Timmie has Roger take the mount and with him giving his friend instructions on what to do in the race , while hiding in a tree overlooking the race-track , Rogers and The Pookah end up winning it in a heart stopping stretch run ending to the movie . 15 year-old Judy Garland who even though had a secondary role in the movie did receive top billing together with stars Mickey Rooney and Ronald Siclair and also sang the movie's title song " Gotta A Pair of New Shoes " .
Terror Down Below	SPOILERS Leaving it's port of call , the US Navel base at Bangor Maine , and sailing out to the Pacific the US Nuclear Submarine USS Lansing is some ten miles off the coast of North Korea . It's then that the Communnist Koreans detonated a nuclear device short-circuiting it's electronic and communication equipment , as well as knocking out power in all the surrounding countries , leaving the ship totally in the dark to what's happening in the outside world . The Lansing's commander young Capt . Miles Sheffield , Casper Van Dien , tries to get in contact with the Pacific Fleet commander Admiral Eugene Justice , Gerald MacRaney , headquartered at Pearl Harbor but all communications are dead . This leads the second in command of the ship Lt . Com . Albert Kenner , Stewart Bick , to feel that the US is under attack . Kenner wants Capt . Sheffield to launch the Lansing's four nuclear-tipped Tomahawk missiles at either Communist China or the new Russian government in the former Soviet Union , whom he feels are at war with the United States . We've seen earlier in the movie that there's trouble brewing between the crew over the fact that Capt . Sheffield was put in command of the Lansing over Capt . Kenner who's more respected by many of those on board due to his much more experience in the underwater , or silent , service . With a total black-out to what's happening in the world above Capt . Sheffield tells the concerned , and almost hysterical , let . Com . Kenner that he'll have the Lansing surface to show him that everything on shore is all right and not to worry . Breaking on the surface outside the South Korean seaport of Ulsan it turns out that there's no sign of life at all with the entire town pitch black , this due to a power black-out not a nuclear attack like Let . Com . Kenner feels happened . Later when returning below it's discovered that both Sheffield & Kenner were contaminated by fall-out , from the North Korean nuclear blast . Kenner and his followers on the sub , seeing their chance , forcibly takes command of the Lansing from Capt . Sheffield who was suffering from a far more serious radioactive dose , as was not given the proper medication , that Kenner was . The new commander Capt . Kenner quickly has the four nuclear-tipped Thmahawk missiles armed and ready to be launched at cities in both China and Russia in retaliation for , what he thinks was , their attack on the US . With no way of getting in touch with the Lansing , and it acting erratically at sea , Admerial Justice reluctantly comes to the realization that it's in danger of igniting a world war . Admerial Justice sends out the US attack Submerine USS Mako to first communicate with the Lansing to stop it's unstable and dangerous actions or , if that doesn't work , sink it before it does . Exciting and heart-stopping ending with Capt . Sheffield and his crewmen retaking control of the sub and at the same time being tracked by the attack-sub Mako that's trying to sink it not knowing that Capt . Sheffield had the Tomahawks disarmed and stopped from being launched . Using evasive Maneuvers the Lansing Sails underwater through the very dangerous " Tin Can Alley " , aptly named for the scores of sunken ships left there from the Russo-Japanese War , outside the Russian port-city of Vladivotok . The Lansing makes it to safety in Russian waters as the Mako withdraws from the chase not attempting to navigate through the hazardous ship graveyard . Surfacing the crew of the Lansing found out that there was indeed life in the city and that no world war broke out above sea and at the same time they didn't , unknowingly and tragically , start a world war from down below .
Read Me !	( There are Spoilers ) Out of the ordinary film about a somewhat whacked out young woman Morvern Callar , Samantha Morton , who's discovery of her live in boyfriend James Gillespie dead in their apartment on Christmas Eve drives her off the deep end . James for some reason killed himself by slashing his wrists just as he finished his great Scottish novel . Leaving instructions on his computer , but not saying why he did himself in , for Morvern James tells her to get his " litereary masterpiece " published as a last favor for him . If she wasn't nuts already , before discovering James dead , Morvern completely losses it not even bothering to report James ' death to the local police or health department . This has James lying in the apartment for almost a week slowly decomposing , as well as attracting flies and roaches , where Morvern had to finally get rid of him . She does this ghastly job by chopping James ' corpse up into little pieces and dropping them off in the woods outside of town . Now with her wiring James ' novel to British book publishers Tom Boddington , James Wilson , and his girlfriend Venessa , Linda McGuire , Morvern plans to get in touch with them in Andulucia in warm and sunny Southern Spain , from cold and damp Argyll Scotland , to see just what they both think of it . Morvern not only sent the novel to the London book publishers but also , something that they don't know , put her name on the manuscript as if she , not James , wrote it . The remainder of the film has Morvern who empties out her late boyfriends James ATM account , of over 3 , 000 pound sterling , together with her best friend Lanna , Kathleen McDermott , traveling to Spain for a long vacation . Lanna has no idea of what her friend Morvern is really up to in that she keeps James ' death from her as well as his unpublished novel . Lanna doesn't know that she's only going along with Morvern just to keep her company until she contacts Tom & Venessa who by now are very interested in having her , or really James , book published . We have a number of sexual escapades with Morvern and Lanna with some young men they meet at a local hotel in Spain with Morvern getting seriously involved with the boy from hotel-room # 1022 , Raife Patrick Burchell . Raife had just learned that his mother passed away and Morvern hearing him sobbing in his hotel-room offers him comfort , as well as sex , to ease his terrible loss . It seemed to me that Morvern saw in Raife the same loneliness and depression that she's now suffering from because of her lover , James Gillespie , suicide . It's later when Morvern has Lanna rush out of the hotel , with only her underwear on , for a taxi ride into Central Spain that Lanna finally realized that her good friend is on the verge of having a nervous breakdown . Leaving Lanna alone , with enough cash to get back to Scotland , Morvern finally gets in touch with Tom & Vanessa about her book that their so impressed with . It's then when Morvern starts to get second thoughts in what she's doing , stealing James manuscript . But with the 100 , 000 pounds sterling advance for her , or James , book offered by Tom & Venessa has Morvern suddenly change her mind . SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT ONHalf baked ending with Morvern back in Argyll Scotland , with a check for 100 , 000 pound sterling , getting in touch with a surprised Lanna at the local watering hole . Offering to take Lanna on another European tour Morvern is rebuffed by Lanna telling her that the boring life in Argyll is just find with her . Lanna seems to have had enough of Morvern and her hair-brained ideas of what a good time really is . Alone with Lanna not there to share her money with her Morvern is last seen sitting on the dock of the railroad station waiting for the train to pull up and take her for a long ride out of town . Despite having a very confusing story that just goes on and on without , in most scenes , making any sense at all " Morvern Callar " has some of the best and eye popping , mostly in the scenes in Spain , cinematography I've ever seen . It's for that and that reason alone that " Morvern Callar " is more then worth watching and sitting through .
Bye Bye Blackbird	SPOILERS Having been lost and missing for almost five hundreds years since it was grabbed by a bunch of pirates on the high seas the Matlese Falcon , a black coded statue made of solid gold and encrusted with finest of jewels , had finally been tracked down in Hong Kong by the Fat Man . That enormous , in both body and mind , and well read and cultured Kasper Gutman , Sidney Greenstreet . It's there in the British Crown Colony where the Fat Man had a falling out with two of his gang members Brigid O'Shaughnessy , Mary Astor , and her boyfriend Thursby who checked out with the bird to what they thought was the safety of San Francisco . With The Fat Man and his boys sweet smelling Joel Cairo , Peter Lorre , and Wilmer " Two Gun " Cook , Elisha Cook Jr , bearing down on her and Thursby Brigid desperately go to SF private dick Sam Sapde , Humphrey Bogart , for help . Using the fake name Mrs . Wonderly Brigid claims that she's in the city looking for her kid sister Croinne who's being abused by her , Brigid's partner in crime , associate Thursby . Spade's partner PI Miles Archer , Jerome Cowan , at first takes the case . Later that evening checking on Thursby in his hotel Archer ends up getting shot and killed by an unknown gunman . It also turns out that Thursby is also murdered leaving Spade in a real tight spot by , besides Brigid , being the only person alive who knows or is about to know about what the connection is between the two murdered men : The Maltese FalconSpade is now in trouble with not only the Fat Man Mob but the police who think that he murdered both Archer and Thursby . Spade's secret affair with Archer's wife Iva , Gladys George , didn't help either giving him a motive to murder his partner . The movie then has Spade being confronted by the Fat Man's two buffoonish hit-men Cairo & Cook , the comical C & C boys . Tough guy Spade has no trouble at all making monkeys of them by alway beating the two doofuses to the punch and taking their pieces , guns , away from them without even breaking a sweat . There's a big break in the case of the missing bird that suddenly comes out to the surface . It's when the captain of the boat La Poloma Capt . Jacobi . John Huston , that brought the Fat Man and his gang to the states from Hong Kong is badly wounded in an assassination attempt after his boat was mysteriously set on fire in San Francisco Harbor . Jacobi escaping with both his life and the black bird makes it to Spades place with it just before he collapses and passes away . Spade putting the bird away with his trusted secretary Effie , Lee Patrick , now has all the marbles that the Fat Man is looking for . He then decides to play hard ball with him knowing full well that he has implicated himself in three murders , his partner Archer Thursby & Capt Jocobi , in doing so . Big and long winded final at Spades apartment with Sam Spade and the Fat Man and his boys and girl , Brigid , trying to figure just whom to set up as the pasty for the three murderers in the Maltese Falcon affair . It's then decided that the wimpy and tough-talking " Two Gun " Cook is the lucky guy to pin it on . The big surprise comes later when Effie brings the bird back to her boss Sam Spade and the Fat Man as it in fact turns out to be a fake . The big surprise causes Fat Man Gutman to completely loses it , mumbling unintelligently to himself , as he and both Cairo & Cook check out of the apartment empty handed as they plan to check out of the country as well . It seems that the person whom the Fat Man bought the bird from , a former czarist general named Kemidov , tricked him back in Hong Kong by slipping the Fat Man a phony lead , not golden , bird and then taking off with the real one : The Maltese Falcon ! Spade calls the cops who quickly apprehend Fat Man Gutman and his gang . It's then that he confronts Brigid who , unlike the Fat Man and his boys , foolishly stayed behind thus exposing herself as the real mastermind behind this whole squalid affair as well as being the one who blasted away Sapde's partner Archer . Grabbed by the police who raid the apartment a mind-numbed and almost comatose Brigid is lead away to the police station by the officers in the building elevator with Spade instead taking the stairs . It seems that Sam Spade had very deep guilt feelings about his dead partner Miles Archer and the way he betrayed him by having an affair with his old lady Iva behind his back . Feeling in some way that he's as responsible for Archer's murder as much as Brigid was is what I feel lead to Spade's decision in taking the stairs and not the elevator down to the building lobby together with Brigid and the police . This conscious , or subconscious , decision on Spade's part will very well get him in his guilty mind to the same place , the hot spot where the sun don't shine , that Brigid is ultimately headed for but it , in Sam Spades case , would take just a little bit longer for him to get there .
Doctor Barton , Doctor Morgan , Doctor Johnson , Mister Grant !

One Step Beyond	( There are Spoilers ) Trying to put his long deceased lover Sarah Williams , Jenniffer Connelly , out of his mind up and coming Chicago politician Fielding Pierce , Billy Crudup , is hunted by her throughout the movie " Walking the Dead " as if Sarah was his guilty consciences . Sarah had been killed in a car bombing some ten year's earlier in her being involved with an organization that protest the conditions in Chile . Being the very idealistic and headstrong young woman that she was Sarah put her life on the line for the downtrodden and underprivileged Chilean peasants that lead to her untimely murder . It was Sarah's selfless actions that sparred Fielding to see her way of thinking . But that only happened after Fielding almost blew his election , for Congressman , which and at the same time had him find his long lost and troubled soul . Trying to cover all the bases , as well as his a , in his future in politics Fielding played it safe in the Vietnam War by becoming a commissioned officer in the US Coast Guard where being sent to fight in Vietman was practically an impossibility . The very politically ambitious Fielding also played ball with the state and local Chicago big wigs from the governor and mayor on down in order to get himself a plumb job in the city's D . A's office which was to serve as a springboard for his future political ventures . While all this was happening his girlfriend Sarah became more and more distanced from him . Sarah felt that the get to the top at all cost Fielding is just a political climber who's concern from the public , mostly the poor and disenfranchised , was only to get their vote and nothing else . It was Sarah's sudden death that put Fielding's career on hold and took the poor guy some ten years to get over it . Now back in action running for a seat in the US Congress Fielding disregarded all that Sarah taught him about serving , in and out of politics , those who needed his help most . As if coming back from the dead Sarah started making ghostly or real live appearances , where only Fielding can see her , in an effort to spook Fielding by making him more of a feeling and caring human being . The question is if Sarah is actually alive , and faked her death , or only an illusion in Fielding's unbalanced mind ! Which may be due to his guilt ridden conscious or the result of a combination of sleep deprivation and prescription drugs , as well as alcohol , in his non-stop 24 hour around the clock campaign to get himself elected ? SPOILER ALERT The movie makes it's point in a very confusing way where we in the audience as well as the confused and befuddled Fielding don't really know if the supposed long dead Sarah Williams is really alive or the product of Fielding very fertile imagination . Fielding's last encounter with the ghostly Sarah at the end of the movie gets his head back on together in helping the poor infirmed and financially destroyed in his district to get back on their feet . We'll never know , like Fielding , if in fact it was Sarah in the flesh or conjured up from deep inside his subconscious that got Fielding to do the right thing ! But whatever the reasons were , real or imagined , it worked !
Murders just don't happen in the Hamptons !	SPOILERS Made for TV movie about the brutal murder of multi-millionaire banker / financier Ted Ammon , David Sctcliffe , and the twisted logic that lead to that crime by his estranger wife the former Generosa Rand , Poppy Montgomer , and her boyfriend and later husband Danny Pelosi , Shawn Christian . Having what had to be the perfect marriage both Ted and Generosa had everything that a couple could want . A ten million dollar waterfront home in the exclusive Hamptons out in Long Island NY , the playground of the rich and famous on the east coast , and a palace almost the size of Buckingham in jolly old England . With Generosa not being able to conceived the Ammons adapted two beautiful children twins Alexa and Gregory , Alliasen Misclone & Mitchell Nye , and then settled down with Ted starting his own financial firm which was highly successful and Generosa becoming a full-time housewife and part-time artist . The one thing that was wrong , fatally wrong , with the Ammon's " Perfect Marriage " was Generosa's deteriorating mental state which had her erupt over the most minute details in her life with Ted like a slight variation of colors of the tulips planted in the Ammon estate's backyard . Incident like that lead to the disintegration of their marriage and the death / murder of Ted Ammon . Suspicious beyond belief Generosa had Ted followed all day by private detectives at his job showing Ted photos of him and a woman , who worked at his firm , and connecting them with him having an illicit affair with her . Generosa even accusing Ted of having a baby with the woman just about convinced him to move out of the house . Ted soon came to realized that Generosa was insane just like her mother was . While working out divorce papers with her and Ted's lawyers Generosa and the kids moved out of the Hampton estate and bought , with Ted's money of course , a nine million dollar apartment in Manhattan . It was there where she met fell in love and involved in her husbands murder the ruggedly handsome Danny Pelosi who was working as a construction contractor at her new apartment . True story with a penetratingly performance by Poppy Montgomer as the unstable Generosa Ammon who's paranoia lead not only to her marriage dissolving but to the death / murder of her husband the hard working and loving family man Ted Ammon . David Sctcliffe is just as good as miss . Montgomer as the ill-fated Ted Ammon who despite giving in to almost all of Generosa's demands in their divorce , all Ted wanted was the house in the Hamptons and visiting rights to the children . Despite getting everything that she wanted Generosa just had to have him killed to be able to " live " with herself and Danny . Shawn Christian as Danny Pelosi is both scuzzy and , in his own way , likable at the same time . Even though Danny had a criminal record that includes violence he never mistreated Generosa or the children , as well as his own kids that he had from his previous marriage . In fact both Alexa and Gergory genuinely liked Danny and excepted him as their father after he married Generosa . It was Generosa who had to push a noticeably reluctant Danny to murder Ted and in the end it was she who , in an ironic twist of fate , got off Scot-free due to her dying of cancer and it was Danny who ended up getting 25 to life in the state pen .
Do You Realize What Your Asking ! ! !	( Some Spoilers ) Has already reached cult status in the ranks of bad but unintentional funny and hilariously entertaining movies " The Green Slime " is one of those films that most people who've seen it say is so bad that it's actually great . The story takes place in the not so distant future with this space station Gamma III getting information from it's home base on earth , the Huston Space Center , that a killer asteroid , Flora , is headed for earth and is to reach its target in less then ten hours . The asteroid is so big , six million tons , that if it crashes it will annihilate in the blink of an eye all life on the blue and watery planet ! Getting the retired Commander Jack Rankin , Robert Horton , out of retirement to do the job his immediate superior Gen . Jonathon B . Thompson played by actor Bud Windon , in his first and only movie role , has to get him to work with his former friend and now bitter adversary Commander Vince Elliott , Richard Jacekal , who commanding Gamma III . There's also a little sub-plot involving Commander Elliott's fiancée the head doctor on the space station the red headed and hot blooded Dr . Lisa Benson , Luciana Paluzzi . Lisa had been in love with the all business and by the book , in doing his job , Jack Rankin before she met the super sensitive and somewhat schmucky Vince Elliott who stoled her away from him . This rivalry in itself will cause far more damage to those on board , or on earth , then Asteroid Flora ever will . Reluctantly following Rankin's orders to travel , together with him , to the out of control asteroid Elliott and his crew do in fact pull off the impossible . Setting or planting a number of nuclear bombs all over the " hot rock " the Rankin expedition blast the asteroid out of its orbit and save the earth . The only problem is that an algae-like substance that was growing on Flora latched itself on to the spacesuit of one of the crew member Michael played by Richard Hyllard , who also like Bud Windom , in his only movie role . That pulsating green algae will later grow and multiply at a fantastic rate living off the energy of the Gamma III space station ! With the space crew safely on board Gamma III the algae , known as the Green Slime , sucks up all the energy on board and grows into this octopus-like creature attacking and killing , by electrocuting , everyone and everything in the space station . The top scientist on Gamma III Dr . Hans Halvorsen , Ted Gunther , realizing what a find , a living organism outside the earths atmosphere , this creature is jeopardizes everyone on the space station by trying , against orders from Commander Rankin , to keep the thing alive for future studies . Making things worse then they already are Dr . Halvorsen in his bizarre actions to keep the creature alive not only lets it multiply , into hundreds of octopus-like creatures , but ends up being electrocuted by it ! It's now up to past bitter enemies , and now best of friends again , Commanders Rankin and Elliott to head off the Green Slimes from killing the entire , including themselves , crew of Gamma III . With time quickly running out and the creatures , the Green Slimes , now in the hundreds if not thousands sealing off the space stations only escape hatch there's only one way to stop them ! A kamikaze-like attack lead by the two commanders who know if they don't succeed it will be curtains not only for them but the entire human race ! Campy but great action sequence with really cool special effect , for 1969 , that more then make up for the films many deficiencies due to its very meager and shoestring budget . In fact there's not a single scene in the movie that I found at all boring even the corny love triangle between Commanders Rankin Elliott and Dr . Benson . In fact I found the relationship between Rankin and Elliott far more effective and genuinely moving , in a platonic and non-sexual way , then that between the two commanders and their love interest in the movie Dr . Lisa Benson !
Top of the World	Tragic but true story about the disastrous mountain climbing expedition of Mount . Everest in the spring of 1996 . Two teams assemble at the foot of Everest headed by world renowned mountain climbers Rob Hall and Scott Fischer with a group of armatures climbers who paid as much as $65 , 000 . 00 apiece for the opportunity to scale the highest point on earth ; the 29 , 028 foot five and a half mile high Mount . Everest . Slowly moving up Everest's snowy slopes the teams reach Camp # 3 which is just under what is called the " Death Zone " 26 , 000 feet up where you can't can't survive without an oxygen mask for any long period of time . What these dizzying heights do is cause your lungs to work four times as hard pumping the same amount of air that they normally get at sea level . The brain then swells up causing unbelievably painful headaches with the lungs filling up with liquid , that if not immediately attended to , can drown you . Then your body becomes so starved for nutrients that it starts to literally feed on itself . This is what happens to a mountain climber reaching these heights , + 20 , 000 feet , who's not fully aware and prepared for the reception that he'll get up there from Mother Nature . Going towards the Everest summit in sub-freezing weather the men , and women , of the expedition scale the dangerous " Hillery Step " which is the last step to climb before reaching the very top . Told by Scott that if it's 2 : 00PM to immediately start back down , even if the climbers are within 50 yards of the summit , his words are ignored . The climbers instead of turning back after the dreaded 2 : 00PM deadline keep climbing and one by one they all reach the top of Everest between the 2 ; 00PM cut-off point until as late as 4 ; 45PM which turned out to be a fatal mistake on their part . Earlier on the climb at camp # 1 Sherpa guide Ang Dorge spotted two of the climbers , a man and woman , embracing outside their tent and got very upset feeling that they , not being married , were very disrespectful to the mountain and that it would lead to an angry response from Everest . Being told by climber and writer Jon Krakaur that it's not unusual for an unmarried couple to have relations back home in America . Jon is reminded by Ang Dorge that their in Napal not in America and what he's saying has nothing to do with native superstitions but that it's based experience and reality . Later when the climbers make their chilling decent from the mountain they find out just how real Ang Dorge's words really were . Leaving late in the afternoon to climb down the mountain , after planting flags and taking photos on Everest's summit , an unexpected storm kicked up and engulfed the entire summit area in darkness with 70 MPH winds and wind-chill temperatures of under - 100 degrees . A number of the climbers started getting lost in the snowstorm and then ended up freezing to death . Among those who perished in the snows of Everest were the two team leaders of the exportation Scott Fischer and Rob Hall . The story of the climb is told to us in flashback by the author of the book " Into Thin Air : Death on Everest " writer Jon Krakaur who also was on the expedition but unlike some of his fellow mountain climbers lived to tell , as well as write , about it .
Writers Block ?	SPOILERS Hard to follow movie , due to it's convoluted storyline , even when you kind of figured out what the ending is going to be . " Secret Window " is about a popular author Mort Rainey , Johnny Depp , who's shacked up alone in his country home in up-state New York trying to get the juices flowing in an attempt the come up with a story for new book that he's planing on writing . Knocking at his door is this stranger who came all the way from Mississippi John Shooter , John Turturro . Shooter claims that Mort plagiarized a book that he wrote back in 1997 seven years ago . Mort realizes that he wrote the short story that Shooter claims that he stole from him back in 1994 and had it published in a national magazine , Ellery Queen , a year later in 1995 . Some three years before Shooter claims he wrote it . That doesn't convince Shooter who says that he wan't proof , the June 1995 issue of Ellery Queen , or he'll keep hounding Morth until he publicly gives him the credit for the story . At first Mort dismisses Shooter for a disgruntled and failed writer until he finds his dog , Chico , dead under a blanket with a screwdriver stuck in him . Later Morth hears from his wife Amy , Maria Bello , who's in the process of divorcing him , that her house was burned down which Morth rightfully suspects was the work of Shooter , just like the killing of his dog Chico . Mort gets in touch with New York Private Eye and good friend Ken Karsch , Charles Dutton , to find out just who this John Shooter is and if he's responsible for the death of Chico and the arson of his wife's home and what can be done to put him behind bars . Later after Ken came to Morth's home , and checked out the place for any signs of Shooter and left , Shooter appeared and roughed up Morth where he badly bruised his arm . Calling Ken at the motel he's staying at in town about the incident Ken and Mort agree to meet the next morning at a local diner with a witness Tom Greenleaf , John Dunn-Hill , who saw Shooter talking to Mort the day before . The film " Secret Window " really starts to get weird now when both Ken & Greenleaf don't show up at the diner and Mort later finds them murdered in Greenleaf's SUV , by Shooter , on Mort's property . Shooter had set up Mort for the murder for both Ken and Greenleaf in his attempt to get him to right the wrong of stealing his story . Later Mort gets through the mail a copy , from his lawyer , of the 1995 issue of Ellery Queen with his story " Secret Window " , that Shooter says that he stole from him in 1997 , torn out ! Was Shooter responsible for that too ? There's also a sub-plot in the film between Mort and his wife Amy and her lover Ted Miner ( Timothy Hutton ) , who we saw Morth at the beginning of the movie catch in bed together in a motel room . that story seems to morph into the story between Mort and Shooter that in the end leads to murder . Johnny Depp does his best to make the movie work as the confused and a bit psychotic Mort Rainey but just can't pull his act off . John Turturro was good as the mysterious John Shooter and his weirdness was just right for the part that he played . Both Timothy Hutton and Maria Bello were almost as mysterious , as Mort's wife Amy and her lover Ted , as the off-the-wall John Shooter was . The ending of " Secret Window " was a bit contrived , it was somewhat of a cross between the films " Children of the Corn " and " Silence of the Lambs " , and left you with the feeling of a sequel , if the film is a major financial success , not far behind .
The swamp shall have him	SPOILERS German movie about a masked killer in and around the English castle of Blackmoor who's out to avenge his fathers murder by the future Lord Lucius Clark , Rudolf Fernan , who lives there . The killer who's father Charles Manning was Clark's assistant and good friend in the British colony of Kimberly in Africa , where Clark was the district governor , was murdered by Clark who stole over 6 million in pound sterling worth of uncut diamonds that his father had . What the killer doesn't seem to know is that Clark is really his father , which was brought out at the end of the movie . But there seems to be some disconnect here with the killer when it's revealed that he came upon a batch of love letters by Clark to his mother Bettie Manning that he found hidden in the castle ! the guy couldn't put two and two together ? Early in the movie we see that Clark is having the stolen diamonds cut by his creepy butler Anthony , Dieter Eppier , who used to be an expert diamond cutter until he was sent up the river for five years for stealing diamonds from his employer . Clark is secretly sending the diamonds hidden in cigar tubes to the owner of the " Old Scavenger Inn " in London Mr . Travish , Hands Nielson , who's fencing the hot diamonds by paying Clark in cash for them . What both Clark and Travish as well as Clark's lawyer Mr . Tromby , Richard Haussler , doesn't know is that the killer has someone working at the " Old Scavenger Inn " , his wife , who's tipping him off about the transactions . At one point in the movie he ambushes Clark's delivery man with the diamonds who happens to be his gardener Sebastian , Albert Bessler , killing him and taking the stones . What the cagey Clark is doing is getting rid of the diamonds so that the killer can't get his hands on them and giving the money that he gets from Travish to his niece Claridge Dorsett , Karin Dor , as stated in his will on or after her 21th birthday . The masked killer is determined to get the diamonds or the money that Clark gets for fencing them before she does even if it kills her . Interesting German 1963 import that has you guessing to who the killer is until he's dredged out of the swamp outside Blackmoor Castle at the end of the movie and his identity reveled . " Strangler of Blackmoor Castle " is a bit too violent for movies released back then in those days in the early 1960's with a number of shocking and bloody decapitations that are really gruesome even watching the movie now . The film does have some comic relief in it with the lord of the castle Lord Blackmoor , Hans Reiser , spending all his time listening and recording on his portable tape recorder bird love calls in the woods .
There's just one reason to watch " Impulse "	Fairly interesting movie about an undercover policewoman which unfortunately gets muddled . As the story tries to cover too much ground that in the end leaves everyone watching confused and unconcerned about what it's trying to tell them . Trying to mix big time drug dealers and protected witnesses who the DA is trying to get to testify against their former associates , the mob , with an obsessive and corrupt police officer . Together with an undercover policewoman who has enough problems outside as well as inside the police department doesn't jell together in this very complicated and confusing movie . Besides all the negative things one can say about the movie " Impulse " the one very positive thing about the film is the appearance and acting of it's beautiful and talented star Teresa Russell . Teresa makes you , in many cases , forget the plot holes and inconsistencies of the movie just by watching her whenever she's on the screen .
Estimate of the Situation	Timely documentary about the UFO , or really extraterrestrial and intelligently manned space craft , debate that has been baffling military men scientists and astronomers , as well as the public , since the end of WWII . Released about the same time that the Roswell Crash of 1947 became public the film " UFO's : It Has Begun " has gone from being just another one of many UFO films or documentaries to a forerunner to the real facts that came out of the Roswell Crash . The evidence that has been made public , released due to the Public Freedom of Information Act , make the point that there's a real possibility that were being visited by beings or spacemen from outer space not just over the last 50 years or so but since the dawn of human history . There's three cases , or UFO encounters , in the movie that have been known long before Roswell was made public in 1978 that really stand out . These cases show that UFO's may very possibly be real and that the US Government has been covering up their existence from the public in order not to create panic in the fear that they , not the US military and air force , rule the skies and that there's nothing the government can do about it . The first of the three earth-shaking encounters took place outside Louisville Kentucky on January 7 , 1948 when veteran combat pilot Capt . Mantell chased , in his P-51 fighter plane , an unidentified object that was reported to be at least 200 feet in diameter . After reaching the 20 , 000 foot level Capt . Mantell lost control of his plane and crashed or what some eye witnesses said exploded in mid air as he fell to his death below . Mantell who flew hundreds of combat missions in WWII and during peacetime we were told , by the USAF , mistook the UFO for the planet Venus ! A pilot of the caliber of Capt . Mantell would never mistake a planet , this in broad daylight , for something that was less then a mile away from him and climbing at tremendous speed unless he was either drunk or high on drugs which , as the autopsy on him proved , Mantell wasn't ! The second UFO incident in " UFO's : It Has Begun " that shows that UFO's may very possibly be the real McCoy had to do with the spectacular July 1952 UFO flap over the Alexandria-Clarendon Axis or corridor that covers the very seat of power of the United States Government its capital Washington D . C . For over two weeks aggressive and unconcerned UFO's criss crossed the night skies over D . C , the most heavily defended place on earth , with the USAF totally unable to not only stop them but even keep up with the mysterious glowing flying objects . Playing a dangerous , for the USAF , game of cat and mouse the UFO's out maneuvered , making sharp and unbelievable right angle turns , and out paced , going at speeds of over 7 , 000 mph , the most modern USAF fighter aircraft , the F-94 saber-jets . Things got so out of hand that President Truman almost called for a state of emergency feeling that the nation was under attack and was unable , with the USAF rendered useless by the speedy unidentified flying objects , to do anything to stop it . Trying to keep the American public from panicking the US military reported that the UFO's seen both on radar and by thousands of eye witnesses , including experienced combat pilots , were nothing more then weather inversions ! The third UFO incident of note in the film " UFO's : It Has Begun " took place on October 18 , 1973 outside of Cleveland Ohio . It's there when a US Army reserve helicopter came face to face with a large object in the night sky that not only paced along with it but , hovering over the craft , kept the helicopter from descending to the ground by toeing it up into the sky , like it was a giant and powerful magnet . The with the pilot in charge of the craft Capt . Coyne desperately pushing hard on the controls for it to go down ! The craft was totally under the unknown flying objects control for at least ten minutes as it inexplicably and slowly ascended upwards , with the UFO hovering just a few feet overhead , from 1 , 000 to almost 4 , 000 feet . All this was seen by dozens of eye witnesses as well as recorded on ground radar by startled and terrified air traffic , civilian as well as military , controllers !
See Palermo and Die	SPOILERS " The Palermo Connection " starts off as a very interesting film about the corruption in New York City . Due to the influx of illegal drugs a young reform councilman tries to take the profit out of drugs that in the end costs him his life . Councilman Carmine Bonavia , James Belushi , is running for mayor of the city of New York and is far behind in the polls with the election just weeks away . Trying to come up with a new issue that will jump-start his campaign Carmine comes up with the idea of legalizing drugs and thus taking the profit motive out of them . The Mafia who traffics in illegal drugs uses the drug profits to pay off and corrupt the local police and politicians to look the other way . Getting married to Carrie , Mimi Rogers , who works on on his campaign for mayor Carmine plans to spend his and Carrie's honeymoon in Palermo Sicily the ancestral home of his parents . He also wants to see from there how his idea of drug legalization does for his chances of him getting elected . Unknown to Carmine the Mafia in both New York and Palermo are setting him up for a fall in order to stop him from taking away their drug profits if and when he gets elected mayor of NYC . Hard hitting but admittedly slow moving film about the evils of illegal drugs and how their used to destroy physically as well as morally everything that they touch . We get to see how a courageous young big city activist is destroyed in trying to combat that evil . Carmine's poll number start to dramatically shoot up with him being 11 % ahead in the race and in no time at all he's a shoo-in to get elected mayor of the city of New York , this makes the nervous Mafia bosses go into action . Getting Carmine involved in the killing of a flower boy , which was really done by the Mafia , in a Palermo fish market the Mafia have him blackmailed by secretly photographing the entire event . The Mafia uses those photos to get him off and at the same time using them as leverage to keep Carmine in line in trying to have him drop the issue of drug legalization after he's elected mayor . " The Palermo Connection " has it's good points about the cause of crime but is too slow and takes a lot of attention to really follow and understand the film . There's almost no action at all in the movie and there are times that it lags by putting in scenes that seem to have nothing at all to do with the story the film is telling it's audience . The mystery as well as sultry women who seems to be trying to split up Carmine and Carrie in Palermo by starting an affair with Carmine is one such example . One thing you have to say for the movie is that it's about as honest as a film can get about the drug menace that's destroying almost ever major city in America , as well as all over the world . With the active participation of those law enforcement officials who are sworn to combat it .
The Ultimate Evil	SPOILERS A number of brutal and ritualistic-type murders that have taken place in Georgetown has police Let . Bill Kinderman , George C . Scott , deeply concerned . Let . Kindeman was in charge of the " Gemini Killer " serial murder case that happened fifteen years ago and the MO of these killings are identical to that of that long ago killer . The fact that the murder victims now , a 12 years-old boy and two Catholic priests , were killed exactly the same way as those victims of the " Gemini Killer " were back then . The method of his savage actions was never reviled to the newspapers and the public yet these killings could not have possibly been done by him since the " Gemini Killer " was executed back in 1973 , or was he ? Worthy follow-up to the original movie " The Exorcist " if you throw out the ridicules " The Exorcist Part II : The Heretic " made some thirteen years earlier . William Peter Blatty's " Exorcist III " starts where " The Exorcist " left off when the heroic Father Karras , Jason Miller , fell down a long flight of stairs outside the MacNeil residents taking the demon who was in possession of young Regan MacNeil's body with him to his death . At that very moment the convicted " Geemini Killer " James Venamun , Brad Dourif , was executed for his crimes . The Devil took advantage of this moment in time by transferring the soul of Venamun into the dead Father Karras ' body and at the same time bring Karras back to life . Wondering around the streets of Georgetown the now unrecognizable and comatose Father Karras was taken into a local mental institution where he spent the last fifteen years , strapped down in a padded cell , and known to those in charge only as patient X . As time went by Karras ' mental facilities slowly came back to him and with Venamun in control of his body and , this is hard to take , soul has been using the mental patients to do his bloody work . Manipulating their , crippled and very impressionable , minds the patients go out in the neighborhood as well as in the hospital and commit this latest string of " Gemini " killings . " Exorcist III " has a lot of dream-like and surrealistic scenes in it which at times confuses you . As it moves to it final conclusion , in the graphic battle between " Good " and " Evil " , it becomes very clear to what it's been telling you for the first 90 minutes or so . " The Devil " through the helpless Father Karras , whom he brought back from the dead , is waging his war against " Good " with one of those saintly men who stood fought and died for it . George C . Scott gives his usual top-rate performance as the troubled and gilt-ridden , he felt that he should have saved Father Karras back in 1973 , police Let . Kinderman . At first Let . Kinderman didn't really understand what he was up against , the Devil . When he finally did , at the end of the movie , he not only cast the Devil's demons out of the tragic priest but put Karras tortured soul to rest and peace forever , in a truly shocking and memorable final sequence . Both Brad Dourif & Jason Miller were just as good as Scott as the " Gemini Killer " James Venamun and Father Karras who both occupied the same , Karras ' , body . Like in a titanic tug of war Venamun and Father Karras were in conflict with each other throughout the entire movie . Until the evil , that was engineered by the Devil , on the people of Georgetown and the Catholic Church was finally put to an end .

Even though at the time when Bishop saw Steve with his father they weren't exactly that close and Steve seemed to have a dislike and resentment for his dad even at his funeral that Bishop attended . It seems that Steve wants to become a " Mechanic " like Bishop and wants to learn the tools of the trade from him , who's the best in the business . Steve likes Bishop's pad in the country and fancy sports car and most of all the danger of his job that is very exciting for the young man who was bored with his life of unending parties . You start to wonder if thats really the reason Steve is so interested to be around Bishop ? Does Steve want to get even with Bishop , who Steve seems to know , killed his father ? And why does Bishop seem to be so agreeable with Steve in teaching him about the art of killing in secret ? Or is Bishop not as naive as he seems to be and is setting Steve up for something ? Intelligent film about the dirty business of the assassination game with Charles Bronson and Jan - Michael Vincent very good as cold-blooded killers who show no emotion at what they do . Slow in the action department , for a Charles Bronson movie , at first but better acted and written then most of the movies that he made back then in the 1970's . With an ending that's one of the best and most surprising finals you'll ever see in any movie .
The only type of killing that's safe is when a Stranger kills a Stranger	( Some Spoilers ) Dead serious in the job that he does Claude , Vince Edwards , is the absolute epitome of a gun for hire , or hit-man . Cold calculating and most of all careful Claude knows just how to deal not only with his victims but those behind the scenes who hire him to rub them out . We get to see just how disciplined Claude is in the first fifteen minutes of the movie when after having an interview with his soon to be boss Mr . Moon in how we see him going about in doing a number of " jobs " for him . Being told to stay in his hotel room for a call , and he's employment with Mr Moon will be terminated if he didn't answer , Claude never leaves the room for two weeks ! Exorcising his very fit and well-developed frame while waiting , until Mr . Moon finally calls him . Giving a hit-job to do for the secretive Mr . Moon Claude does it with style by posing as a barber and slitting the throat of his victim . The next " job " that Claude does for Mr . Moon is at the hospital again posing as a doctor , a precursor to Edwards role as TV Doc Ben Casey , and suffocating his next victim , who's in intensive care by cutting off his oxygen . Finished and payed off by Mr . Moon for a job , or job's , well done Claude pays him an unexpected visit doing a hit-job on him running his startled ex-employer through with a switchblade ; Claude is now working for Mr . Moon's boss Mr . Brink who for reasons that only he knows had Mr . Moon terminated . Being paid $5 , 000 . 00 , ten time his usual fee , Claude is given an all-expense paid vacation and two week stay in L . A to hit a US government witness who's to testify against his now boss Mr . Brink . Being put under the careful watch of his two mob controllers Marc & George when he arrived in the " City of Angels " Claude is soon to realize the devil in the details in his new job . The person Claude is to hit Billie Williams isn't his normal kind of victim . She's a woman who's not only Mr . Brinks ex-gun moll but who's also turning evidence against him . At first just sightseeing and going swimming and deep sea fish diving Clude waste almost all his alloted time in plotting the hit he was assigned to do for Brink . George & Marc get really ticked off at the careless and paranoid way Claude is acting after telling him who the person that he's assigned to knock off is to be . It's then where he for the first time in the film Claude actually shows some feeling for one of his victims . It's not that Billie is just a woman but that she's protected by dozens of police and federal agents . That makes the hit he's paid to do on her so difficult for Claude . After two aborted and messed up attempts on Billie's life , one which results in the death of an undercover police woman , Claude starts to feel that this job is jinxed and wan't out . Only to have himself then set up to be hit by his now angry and frustrated boss Mr . Brink . Having a far easier time in dispatching both his controllers George & Marc , who were secretly contracted by Mr . Brink to knock him off , Claude goes after and sets his gun-sight on Billie for what's now become for him personal not professional reasons . Being the perfectionist that he is Claude is now more then ever determined to finish the job that he was originally contracted to do $5 , 000 . 00 or no $5 , 000 . 00 . One of the best movie about the inner workings and thoughts of a professional hit-man and how he operates in the world of crime . Never leaving any paper trail and always respecting , Claude tries not to use a gun on his job because their illegal , the law until he corners and rubs out his victim . Vince Edwards ' cold-blooded portrayal of professional hit-man Calude is one of the best and at the same time most underrated performances of his career . Edwards presses all the right bottoms during the 81 minutes that he's in the movie where he goes form an almost zombie-like and mindless killer to a swathing and emotionally unstable kook . Who in the end when he finally has Billie right where he wants her to be , alone and in the house with him , he completely blows it and ends up with himself being blown away in return .
Who's that guy reading the newspaper ?	SPOILERS Way ahead of it's time movie that disclosed to the movie going public back in 1949 that there's a sub rosa government working independently from the laws that govern all of us . Which it's far more destructive then any outside enemy , like at that time the Soviet Union , ever was . Hard to follow at first when we see a man Max Von Brog murdered at his printing shop on 506 East 31 st in Midtown Manhattan by a hood known as Knuckles , George Breen . Mr . Borgs wife , Hester Sondergaad , claims that her husband committed suicide . Later she's picked up at the airport trying to flee the country to Mexico City terrified of those who murdered her husband and feeling that she might well be next . Mrs . Von Borg is put into protective custody by Assistant D . A Malloy , Franchot Tone . Local columnist Charles Riggs , Myron McCormick , feels that those who murdered Von Borg , whom he was printing leaflets and posters for , are highly connected in government and that the suspicion of them belonging to some hate group " The Crusaders " . A subversive group that his friend and Assistant D . A Howard Malloy thinks are just a front for their real activities . Later when Riggs goes home to his apartment he's murdered by Knuckles and like Max Von Borg Knuckles makes it look like Riggs killed himself by throwing him out the window . Malloy now with a personal reason to find the killer and those behind him starts making inroads into this group " The Crusaders " . Malloy starts by tracking down the person who did the art work for their posters a Mrs . Sigmund Kosterich , Hedley Rainne . It's from Kosterich where he gets the name of a young woman Barbara Whitfield , Jean Wallace , who he's doing a painting of and also seems to be involved with this mysterious group . Going home one evening Malloy is attacked by Knuckles who he knocks out and disarms . After checking his wallet Malloy finds a business card for a person call " The Angel " Angelo Agostini , Marc Lawrence . It turns out that " The Angel " runs some charity outfit in the city . After Malloy has a talk with " The Angel " everything seems to open up for him where he's appointed Special Prosecutor by the Governor . This after he met with Mrs . Hartley a major NYC political king-makers at a big social party who's also a close associate of " The Angle " . It seems that those in power , Agostini Mrs . Hartley etc . etc . , are trying to buy off Malloy to keep him from finding who and whom their working for . But it doesn't work with the brave and honest Malloy and leads to a shocking and bloody final in the movie . It turned out that the group " The Crusaders " were just a cover and a microscopic part of the real power clique that controls the city of New York if not the entire country . Ground-breaking film who's story has been copied hundreds of times since it's release back in 1949 about those in power who answer to no one but themselves . With both Franchot Tone & Jean Wallace very effective in their parts as the somewhat naive D . A . Who finds out the truth the hard and deadly way . With Jean Wallace as the young singer who also finds out , too late , that she's into something that she had no idea of how dangerous it was . The movie " Jigsaw " has a number of top Hollywood stars in cameo roles and top NYC news & gossip columnist Leonard Lyon who wrote the popular " The Lyons Den " newspaper column . That showed just how important the movie was to them for them to want to be in it . Only the ending was a bit too contrived and phony but with the Hayes Commission back then controlling the US film industry a happy ending was a must in a disturbing as well as dark Film-Noir movie like " Jigsaw " .
180 Degree Turn	SPOILERS Based on a Richard Oursler article in Readers Digest about the real life murder of popular Catholic priest Father George A . Lambert , Wyrley Brich , Eli Kazan's " Boomerang ! " doesn't go into who murdered Father Lambert , the killer was ever apprehended , but in the story of the Innocent man accused of killing him ex-GI and town drifter John Waldron , Arthur Kennedy . With the murder investigation of Father Lambert going nowhere the local Stamford political machine , run by power-broker T . M Wade ( Taylor Holmes ) , goes full-blast in attacking the city administration of reform Mayor Swayze , Walter Greaza , in hopes of getting it's man elected mayor . The murder of Father Lambert turns out to be a political football between the two warring political parties instead of a police affair and investigation . After Waldron is arrested in Ohio and sent back to Conn . to stand trial State Prosecutor Henry Harvey , Dana Andrews , is put on the case . Waldron mentally pounded for three straight days by the police not allowing him to sleep breaks down and confesses to the Lambart murder making his conviction a forgone conclusion . As prosecutor Harvey looks closely at the evidence against Waldon he realizes that the man may very well be innocent . If convicted he'll , Harvey , have to live for the rest of his with the thought that he sent a innocent man to his death . Harvey later finds out that a lot is riding on Waldon's conviction and it has nothing to do with the murder of Father Lambart . A non-conviction will effect the re-election chances of Mayor Swayze . Harvey is also running the risk of destroying a promising political career in state politics , he's already being groomed to be the states governor , by getting Waldon off even if he's innocent . Well paced and honest film about big city politics with a stellar performance by Dana Andrews who didn't let his career ambitions get in the way of his sense of justice . Also in " Boomerang ! " is Jane Wyatt as Prosecutor Harvey's wife Madge . Madge was tricked into an under-the-table deal by the city's Commissioner of Public Works Mac McCreery , Ed Begley , McCreery was terrified that if Mayor Swayze didn't get re-elected and agree , as he promised him , to have the city of Stamford buy his real-estate property it would in the and financially ruin McCreery and possibly land Madge behind bars . Powerful ending sequence in a Stamford courtroom that has all the drama and tension of that of a very good fictitious movie screenplay but in this case all that happened in the movie also happened in real life .

At the base it's reported that the weather had gotten so severe that they would have to abort the expedition and return back to their icebreaker , the Soya , that would take them back home to Japan . Unable to bring them along the men were forced to leave the dogs , including the two who rescued them Taro & Jiro , at the now deserted Showa Base and ; thus leave them to the bitterly cold Antarctica winter that was just starting to set in . Heartwarming and true story of men and dogs and how left on their own the sled dogs , answering the call of the wild , formed a wolf-like pack that for over a year survived everything that the inhospitable Antarctic winter had to offer them ; a frozen and agonizing death . Beautifully photographed with incredible wide angle shots that showed the audience how vast and eerie the Antarctic really is . We see the dogs roaming around like a bunch of dark and unrecognizable black specks in the limitless white background . " Antarctica " also has a number of fascinating views of the Southern Lights , the Borealis Australis , as they illuminate and light up the cold and dark Antarctic winter night . By the time the winter was over , in September 1958 , the Antarctic spring set in with the ice packs breaking apart and causing a number of the surviving sled dogs to fall into the open waters where they drowned .

With all hope gone , for the dogs left behind , like a winter mirage Taro and Jiro materialized out of the snow to the shock and delight , to the point of tears , of those who so sadly were forced to leave them behind and to face certain death .
Being an amateur is loving the game that your playing	( Some Spoilers ) Never in the history on modern professional sports was there ever an individual like golfer Bobby Jones and undoubtedly there never will be another one like him again . Playing his entire career as an armature against the worlds top professional golfers , and not getting a dime for doing it , is in itself something that legends are made of . Thats what Bobby Jones was a legend in his own time . A sickly boy who had trouble eating , and keeping his food down , young Bobby was fascinated with the sport of golf because it wasn't as strenuous as most of the games , like baseball an football , his friends and classmates played . Going against his dad and granddads wish to become a lawyer , like they were , Bobby perused the sport that he loved and reached heights in that sport that have never been attained before or since . Bobby ended up winning the unattainable Golf Quadrilateral which consisted of both the American and British Opens as well as both of those countries Amateur Golf Championhips , or Grand Slam as it's called in 1930 . With no worlds left to conquerer the Bobby at age 28 retired from golf never to play in competition again . At the same time Bobby went to law school and passed the Georgia Bar and became a lawyer in his dad's law firm . James Cariezel is very effective as the short tempered and irritable , at first , and then wise and philosophical , later in his life , Bobby Jones who played golf with a love and determination that no amount of money could motivate . Bobby also played the sport with such excruciating pain that no amount of medication could cure or relive . Bobby was later diagnosed with syringomyelia , a crippling disease that effects the spinal cord , that he had while he was still playing and winning golf tournaments during the 1920's and in 1930 when Bobby won the Golf Quadrilateral or Grand Slam . The movie " Bobby Jones Stroke of Genius " is beautifully photographer with , besides a touching and likable James Caviezel , a wonderful cast with Bobby's wife the former Mary Malone played by Claire Foriani who stood by Bobby all throughout the highs and lows of his golfing career . Mary was the main reason for Bobby giving up golf , before it ended up killing him , and leaving at the hight of his ability and popularity in the sport . Maclolm McDowell is the wise old Atlanta sports reporter and friend of Bobby O . B Keeler who never ceased to be amazed at Bobby's golfing skills no matter how many times he reported on his play on the golf course in both America and the United Kingdom . Jeremy Northam is funny and somewhat sad as the early 20th century golf great Walter Hager who saw Bobby's star eclipse him . Hager began to resent this brash armature who was beating the stuffing out of seasoned and highly professional golfers like himself but in the end he , like everyone else in the movie , became a fan and believer in Bobby Jones . Hager realized that he was more that just a great athlete but a kind unselfish as well as charitable human being . Bobby Jones won the Golfing Grand Slam back in 1930 not only with the god-given ability that he had , and developed over the years , but against the best golfing professionals in the world while suffering from a crippling disease that could very well have put him in a wheelchair for the rest of his life . Since 1930 with 75 years of future golfing greats coming on the scene to hit the golf ball down on the green and on the straightaway no one has ever won golfs Grand Slam event . Only Bobby Jones did it and not for the fame or the money that goes along with winning that magical event but just for the sheer love of the game .
Don't Make The Same Mistake Twice	SPOILERS Even though the movie " They Made Me A Criminal " is nowhere as good as the later John Garfield anti-hero classics like " Body & Soul " in 1947 " Force of Evil " in 1948 and his last and very underrated " He Ran All The Way " in 1951 it's the film that defined his career from that point onward until his untimely death on May 21 , 1952 at the young age of 39 . Garfiled plays the part of light Weight Champion Johnnie Bradfield and later the fugitive from the law Jack Dorney who's innocent of the murder that he's charged with , even though he's been declared officially dead . Jonnie's manager Doc Ward , Robert " Doc " Gleckler , who during a drunken victory party killed reporter Charles McGee , John Ridgely , who was going to expose to the public his fighter Johnnie Bradfield lies about him being a one women guy as well as non drinking momma's boy . Doc Gleckler smashed a bottle over McGee's head killing him as Jonnie was almost dead drunk with a number of women partying in his hotel suite . Doc was later killed in a car crash with Johnnie's girlfriend Goldie , Ann Sheridan , but Doc burned to a crisp and with Johnnie's watch on him was mistaken for Johnnie . Told to stay dead and buried by his lawyer Malvin , Robert Strange , who took $9 , 750 . 00 of the $10 , 000 . 00 of Johnnie's money that he had for this great piece of advice . Malvin told Johnnie to take on a new identity and call himself from now on Jack Dorney and get the hell out of the state of New York ; talking about sleazy shysters . Johnnie now Jack Dorney travels the rails from New York down to Arizona ending up at the Rancho Rafferty Date Farm where most of the film takes place . If it wasn't for John Garfield in the lead role as both Jonnie Bradfield & Jack Dorney the movie would have long been lost and forgotten . Garfield who was only 26 at the time brought the best out of everyone in the movie . Even the transported Dead End Kids , I guess we can call them The Arizona Kids here , acting were notches above what you would have expected from them and they came across as real and sensitive persons not a bunch of slap stick clowns like in almost all of their movies . All that due to being on the same stage , or filming location , with John Garfield . " They Made Me a Criminal " is a good story that has the undercover champ acting like anything but not to draw any attention on himself and end up not only behind bars but in the electric chair . In the end Jack showed just what kind of man he is by not fighting the big fight and against all the odds dramatically winning at the last moment but by going four brutal rounds to get the money for his new found family at the date farm including his girl Peggy , Gloria Dickson , to open up a gas station with it . Giving the European champ Gaspar Rutchek , Frank Riggi , the fight of his life and getting $2 , 000 . 00 , thats $500 . 00 a round , for doing it Jack showed everyone who looked up to him like the " Arizona Kids " that sometimes taking a punch is far braver and more courageous then throwing one . The fact that Jack could have easily clobbered Rutched but didn't in order not to expose himself to the police , as on the loose killer Johnnie Bradfield . But instead went as far as he could taking everything that Rutchek could throw at him to help out his friends showed more then all the fights that he won in the boxing ring put together . I for one didn't find the ending of the movie contrived at all but fitting right in with the story . The cop Morty Phelam , Claude Rains , who came to Arizona from New York to arrest Jack had to live with for years the fact that he once sent an innocent man to the electric chair . We were told all this right at the start of the movie . Why knowing that Jack / Johnnie was innocent of the murder that he's charged with and not knowing for sure if he'll be found innocent of it in a court of law would he want to make the same terrible mistake again ? I can easily see this happening in real life why not then in the movies .
Look everybody's looking at me , this is the first time I ever felt important !	SPOILERS Subliminal and thought-provoking Western that covers far more ground then can be digested in just one screening . Basically a story of a bitter rivalry between Emma Small , Marcedes McCambrige , and Vienna the local saloon owner , Joan Crawford . The two fight over the love and affections of the Dancin ' Kid , Scott Brady . The Dancin ' Kid together with his gang of fun loving and hard drinking cowboys run a silver mine outside of town . Emma was madly in love with the Kid but he dumped her for the much more attractive and down to earth Vienna . This has the vindictive and almost insane with jealousy Emma want to have both of them , the Kid & Vienna , end up with their necks at the end of a hang-rope . With her brother Len gunned down in a stagecoach robbery Emma immediately accuses both the Kid & Vienna of having something to do with Len's death . For the rest of the movie Emma tries to whip up a lynch mob to hang both of them . All this results in total chaos and destruction of the town and it's surroundings as well as almost everyone in the film . With the movies main , who its titled after , character Johnny Guitar , Sterling Hayden , coming onto the scene we get a feeling that him and Vienna seemed to have known each other , very intimately , some time ago . It's obvious just from the strange and revealing dialog between the two : " lie to me say that you really love me " a heart-sick and tearful Johnny pleads to Vienna . Dropping into Vienna's saloon from far flung Albuquerque Johnny we find out was hired by Vienna to entertain the customers with his banjo or guitar but also to protect the place , and Vienna , with his six-shooter . We soon find out that there's much more to Johnny then his talents as a musician but his also lighting fast draw . Johnny is not only the fastest gun in the West Johnny Logan but also Vienna's lover from yesteryear who she broke up with five years ago . Thats when she was a bar-girl and Johhny was the toast of the town in Albuquerque . Now with her owning Vienna's saloon and about to strike it rich , with the railroad slated to go through her property , the shoe is on the other foot . With him needing Vienna not the other way around when she would have crawled at his feet to keep Johnny from walking out on her . The film in a weird way has the two women in it , Vienna & Emma , be far more manly then any man in it . That includes the entire lynch mob who we can find no one with the raw hatred and malice to hang the innocent Vienna . Even though they have no trouble at all stringing up the boy-like Turkey , Ben Cooper , who besides being a member of the Dancin ' Kid's gang was also involved in a bank robbery of the towns bank . We also see at the end of the movie with the shooting and bloodshed getting so out of hand that the lynch mob lead by a now almost crazed Emma not having the stomach , with the entire Dancin ' Kid's gang rubbed out , to go after both Vienna and Johnny . Who were both innocent of the trumped up charges of bank and stagecoach robberies , as well as the murder of Len , by the vindictive and hateful Emma . They just walk off and let both Emma and Vienna shoot it out in the movies exciting and heart-thumping final . One of Joan Crawford's best movies even , in many movie critics opinions , outdoing her Acadamy Award winning 1945 role in " Mildred Pierce " . Undoubatly this was Nicholas Ray's cryptic and camouflaged description of McCathyism and the communist witch hunts back in the 1950's . We see in " Johnny Guitar " how people can be whipped up against an innocent person , or persons , and then lead to do things that they would soon regret . And how people with axes to grind or money to make exploit and foment mindless hatred . As well as use the unthinking and impressionable public to achieve their ends no matter how evil they are and how many innocent persons they destroy .
You Make Me Feel Like Dancing	SPOILERS Slice of life , in the swinging pre-Aids Eepdemic 1970's , movie about a middle-aged married woman Erica Benton , Jill Clayburgh , who's husband Martin , Michael Murphy , leaves her for another and much younger woman . Things couldn't have been better for Erica living on the upper East Side of Manhattan with Michael a successful Wall Street stock broker and her teenage daughter Pattie , Lisa Lucas , who at age 15 is still a virgin but knows everything there is to know about sex . Noticing Michael acting strange and funny Erica thinks that it has to do with the results of a physical examination he recently took but is shocked to find out from him , on a crowded Manhattan street , that he's no longer in love with her and is involved with another woman . Meeting this teacher Marsha Brenner at Bloomingbergs , while waiting on line to buy a new shirt , Michael fell madly in love with her and as a result is leaving his wife of 16 years . This leads Erica into a deep and dark depression that causes her to stop seeing anybody but her fellow friends , all woman divorcées , for support and solace . Having trouble socializing with men brings Erica's depression into even deeper depths as she goes to see psychiatrist Tanya Berkel , Penelope Russianoff , who's also divorced , it seems like every married women in the movie has broken up with their husband , and tries to help her get her life back together telling Erica to go out to the bar and single scene and meet someone new . On the first night Erica goes to a singles bar she meet Chalie , Cliff Gorman , a 1970's type super stud who thinks he's God's gift to women . Charlie , an artist himself , has known Erica from the Rollin Art Gallay where she works at and has been dying to get into her pants , or panties , for some time and now that she's available he sees his big chance . Spending the night with Charlie Erica knows that there's really nothing between them , but a one night stand , and leaves somewhat hurt and disappointed . It later happens that , almost by accident , Erica meets abstract expressionist artist Saul Kaplan , Alan Bates , who's also divorced and realizes that he's the one man she want's to spend the rest of her life with . At an art exhibition a few days later with Saul Erica is confronted by a drunk and obnoxious Charlie who insults Erica by bragging about his one night affair with her . Charlie is nasty as well as both sarcastic and condescending to Saul to the point where he gets his face drenched with a glass of wine by Erica and belted and knocked to the floor by Saul . Charlie seemed to have been so impressed on his night-out with Erica that he couldn't stand to see her with another man . As things start to go well for Erica they grow sour for Michael as his new love Marsha leaves him , or throws him out of her house , less then a month after he married her . Michael almost begging Erica to take him back is shocked that she has a boyfriend who's far more sweet kind and loving , as well as honest , then he ever was with her and finally realizes what a prize he threw away in trying to relive his youth . Saul trying to get Erica to spend the summer with him , and his two children , at his country home in Vermont is left on his own when Erica chooses to stay at her job in New York . Painting an abstract work of art Saul gives it to Erica for a going away present but the damn thing is something like eight by eight feet square ! You would have thought that the kind and understanding Saul would have at least called for a taxi or even a two ton Ryder truck to haul this " piece of art " back to her home all the way up-town from Saul's loft in Shoho to her place on East 68th street in the upper East Side , some 4 to 5 miles away ! but Nooooo ! We see the movie " An Unmarried Woman " end with poor Erica lugging this monstrosity through the streets of Manhattan as , you would expect from New Yorkers , nobody on the heavily traveled and crowded thoroughfares trying to help her .
Whatever happens in this town happens Suddenly !	SPOILERS Hired assassin John Baron , Frank Sinatra , saw just how futile the " hit-Job " , that he and his fellow hired killers who were paid up to $500 , 000 . 00 each , was to assassinate the President of the United States ; " A second after he's shot he'll be replaced by someone else so what's the purpose of killing the President anyway " ? The movie " Suddenly is more then just a solid thriller as well as a curiosity piece . It unknowingly and unconsciously foretells a real presidential assassination , JFK , by some nine years after it's release . The way the assassination is depicted planned and put into motion is far more realistic and believable then what the Warran Commission come up with . Instead of one lone nut all by himself with one gun that The Warren Commission came up with the film had a trio of professional killers . Who were hired by an unknown person , or persons , to knock off the president for reasons known only to themselves . Another oddity about the film " Sudddenly " is that it was actually broadcast on the CBS network's " The Early Show " weeks before the assassination of JFK took place in November 1963 . With the President of the United States special train due to stop at the town of Suddenly the Secret Service FBI and local policemen get a tip of a possible assassination , that they got from a shot and dying hoodlum . The cops search the building and stores by the railway station to make sure that everything is secure for the president's stopover It also turns out the tip was real ; three hired hit men are in town to pay the president a deadly visit . Lead by John Baron the thee , posing as FBI men , take over the home of Pete Benson , a retired Secret Service man , and his widowed daughter Ellen and eight-year-old grandson Pidge , James Gleson Nancy Gates & Kim Charney . The trio shoots both Sheriff Tod Shaw , Sterling Hayden , who was wounded and Secret Service head Don Carney , Willis Bouchey , who died as they came to the door to check things out . It's now just a matter of time for the train to pull up and for them , with Baron as the shooter , to get the president in their cross-hairs . It's between the time that the killers wait for the presidential train to pull up at the station that two of them Benny Conkln & Bart Wheeler , Paul Frees & Christopher Blake , begin to realize what their doing and how the odds are against them to survive and escape from the law ; nobody has ever gotten away with killing a President of the United States and they'll be no exception . Only the psycho and insecure Barnon thinks that he can pull this off , even after Benny is shot dead by the Suddenly police , as he cased out the train station less then an hour before the president's train was to arrive . Being on an ego trip more then anything else Baron , despite the police already being tipped off , is determined to get the job done and in the end does a job not only on his co-hit-men but on himself . Chilling as well as entertaining movie with Frank Sinatra at his best as crazed ex-war veteran John Baron who feels that life had dealt him a losing hand and was to even everything up by killing the president and getting away with it at the same time . Sterling Hayden is a bit stiff as the towns Sheriff Tod Shaw and has a hard time convincing the audience , as well as those on the screen , that he's in danger of losing his life even after he was shot . Hayden reads his lines in such a mechanical way that he comes across as if he's a telephone answering machine . Both Nancy Gates and James Gleason as Ellen & Pete Benson are effective as hostages . Ellen's concern for her son and father as well as her fear of guns , Ellen's husband was killed in the Korean War , comes across believable and at the same time unnerving . Since she's forced to use a hated gun to save her and her father together with Pete , James O'Hara , and her son's Pidge lives towards the end of the movie .
He was never one of us !	( There are Spoilers ) Refreshingly honest , for it's time 1957 , movie about the horrors that were facing the African countries who after the Second World War were emerging from the colonialism imposed on them by the European Colonialist Powers . Obam , Sidney Poitier , has been doing his best for his people through the all black or African political labor party he's been leading and has now been accepted by the white colonial government as a member of it's legislator . Feeling that his brother has sold out to his country's colonial establishment the hot headed Kanda , Clifton Macklin , is now not only stirring up hatred against the government but implicating his brother Obam , who's name in African means hawk , by hanging dead hawks all over the countryside . To make things even worse Kanda has been hanging the dead hawks in front of white settlers homes . Obam trying to get his brother to see that violence will only beget violence later ends up seeing things his brother way instead . This happens when the government refused to give his people the right to vote with the exception of land owners ! Land which Obam's people by law are not allowed to own ! As Obam , seeing that there's no hope in negotiating with the white establishment , turns radical his good friend and mentor Christian Missionary Bruce Craig , John McIntire , tries to get him to see that he's , as well as his brother Kanda , being manipulated by the Communists in his labor party . The Communist who's aim is rule by violence not freedom only want power for themselves not freedom for Obam's people . At first Obam is anything but receptive to Craigs pleas for love and understanding and goes full tilt into revolutionary mode . Going along with the radical Kanda in stirring up trouble Obam's wife Renee , Eartha Kitt in her first major movie role , also tries to get him to to see that what he's doing will only lead to death and destruction for his people and nation ! With the dye now cast for an native uprising against the colonial powers in control of their country Craig in a last desperate effort to get Obam to see his way reveals what happened to him and his wife Barbara , Helen Horton , back in China before and after the Communist took over . Obam is shocked to hear what happened there , after the Communist takeover , and now knows what will happen now when the Communists , who have now taken over Obam's labor party movement , take control of his country ! Bittersweet ending with both Obam and Kanda getting caught up with the madness and violence that swept across their country . It was Craig and his fellow Christian Missionaries Amugu and Sandar Lei , Juano Hernandez & Marne Mathland , that in the end get Obam to see the light in that what he , and Kanda , were doing will only play into the hands of the terrorist-controlled Communist elements . With the Communists getting their way they in the end , like in Communist China , will destroy everything that both Obam & Kanda fought for all these years . Obam now seeing what he's done in lending a hand in his brother ill conceived revolt tries to stop the uprising against the colonialist government before it's too late . Craig for his part put his life on the line running out into the line of fire , between the rampaging Africans and defending white settlers , to stop this madness from getting out of control ! Outstanding performance by the 30 year-old Sidney Poitier that was as good if not better as his Academy Award effort in " Lillies in the Field " or as a back Philadelphia detective in the deep south in the film " In the Heat of the Night " . The fact that " The Mark of the Hawk " is almost unknown to the movie going public in not being shown on TV for at least 30 years or available , until recently , on DVD or video tape has people not realize what a great and timely movie it really is . P . S The multi-talented Eartha Kitt in her first staring movie role as Obam's wife Renee also sings the movies team song " this Man is Mine " referring of course to her husband in the film Obam .
Bandit's At Five O'clock	True story of the valiant B-17 bomber " Memphis Belle's " 25th and last bombing run over the German port city of Bremen on May 17 , 1943 . Having flown 24 bombing missions over Nazi occupied Europe since it's first bombing run on November 7 , 1942 over the city of Brest France this if successful , it's 25th bombing run , would be the planes and crews ticket out of WWII . It had been determined by the US general staff that 25 bombing and combat missions over Europe were the limit that a bomber crew , in order to keep casualties down , can take before they start to fall apart from the stress and cease to be effective . The crew of the " Memphis Belle " are the first to almost reach that goal , 25 successful bombing missions . The unbelievably ferocious German resistance from it vaunted Luftwaffa and ground anti-aircraft batteries over the skies of Europe cost the USAAF and RAF some 35 , 000 planes , fighters and bombers , and their crews , over 150 , 000 airmen , during the bombing of Germany and German controlled Europe from 1942 to 1945 . Thats just how savage and bitter the fighting was for air supremacy over that war-torn continent . Stirring story with fine performances from the " Memphis Belle's " Captain Dennis Dearborn , Matthew Modine , on down . As the legendary bomber weathers wave after wave of deadly German ME 109 Messershmitt fighter planes from the sky and massive and murderous German AK AK anti-aircraft fire from the ground . As the " Memphis Belle " flies over Bremen and drops it's bomb payload and then limps back to England . With it's crew battered and bloody but safe and alive to be the first bomber crew to survive 25 missions over German controlled Europe . The spectacular air combat photography was the best I've ever seen in a war movie and the cast was on par with the " Memphis Belle " with no one outshining the others but all equal up to their task just like the famed bomber was . Back on the ground there was another drama played out with officer Col . Harriman , David Strathaim , who sent out the " Memphis Belle " and the other 23 B-17's of his bomber squadron on their mission over Bremen Germany . Col . Harriman didn't go along with Col . Derringer , John Lithgow , the US public relation officer who seemed too eager to reward the " Memphis Belle " crew with honors and glory even before they successfully finished their 25th mission . Not realizing that he was making the bombers crew and Col . Harriman very nervous with his not understanding how dangerous their mission was and even possibly jinxing them . Tense and terrific the movie has already become a war classic without the false heroics that was so common in war movies made during WWII by Hollywood in order to boost the US morale at home and on the battlefield . The crew of the " Memphis Belle " were just as normal and scared as anyone of us would be if we were in the same situation that they were in . But it was that very fear that brought the best in strength and courage out of them and made them the hero's that they eventually became .
Together Forever	SPOILERS Has to be seen at least twice , like being reincarnated , to really appreciate what a great psychological thriller " Renni " or " Reincarnation " really is . The film gets somewhat confused and esoteric at times , especially in the first five or so minutes , but when it gets down to business just watch out ! Making a horror / suspense film about a bloody massacre that took place back in 1970 at the now abandoned Ono Kanko Hotel outside of Tokyo top Japanese movie director Ikuo Matsumura , Kippei Shiina , cast actress Nagisa Sugiora , Yuka , in the leading role . Nagisa is to play one of the victims of the hotel slaughter the six year old daughter Norishasa , Atsuhsi Haruta , of crazed killer Professor Kazuya Omori , Shun Oguri . What would be the part of a lifetime for the young and practically unknown actress turns out to be a nightmare for her . Telling her good friend and acting teacher Tadashi , Tetta Sugimoto , that she feels strange playing Omori's murdered daughter in that she sees the young girl in both her dreams as well as while she's awake and fully conscious ! There's a scene when Nagisa , while she's with Tadashi , is on the Tokyo Subway and suddenly sees young Norishasa with her battered , with it's left eye busted , doll standing right in front of her ! With Nagisa turning away for a split second to alert Tadashi to what she saw both Norishasa and the doll disappears in a flash ! As the movie goes into production Nagisa begins to become spooked whenever she's to act out a scene in it . Seeing in a number of visions of the insane Professor Omori doing his dirty work slaughtering the people in the hotel Nagisa also sees him recording his bloody work with a 1950's style 8mm Bell & Howell movie camera !

It's when things suddenly start to magically materialize in her hotel room , almost out of thin air , right in front of Nagisa's eyes , like Norishasa's doll and her father's movie movie camera , that it becomes apparent that Nagisa's greatest fears have more then just a a grain of truth in them . MAJOR SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT ONNagisa gives the mysterious movie camera to her friend Tadashi to have the film in it developed and see what exactly is recorded on it . This all takes a number of days for Tadashi in him trying to find a photo lab , being that almost everything now is " filmed " on video tape and DVD discs , that could process the film . When the movie camera film is finally processed Tadashi has it screened in front of Director Matsumura and his film crew . What they see is a horror that even the most brutal and bloody slasher movie couldn't duplicate ! The film also shows that not only is reincarnation real but who the brutal and psychotic killer Poffesor Kazuya Omori really is ! Not back then in 1970 but now in his new incarnation !
I'll have to stay out of rooms with mirrors for the rest of my life , I just like looking at myself too much .	SPOILERS Intelligent and uncompromising movie with an almost total lack of the false heroics , on the part of those victimized , that you would usually expect in films like these of the Hollywood " Blacklist " years . It's September 1951 and Hollywood's " Golden Boy " director David Merrill , Robert de Niro , has just come back from France where he spent the last three years making movies for Fox Studios . David has come back to a country that doesn't resemble the free and open , to ideas and opinions , nation that he left . It's not long afterwords that he's hit with the stark reality of the overblown and self-righteous House of Un-America Activities Committee ( HUAC ) that destroyed , financially as well as psychically , thousands of people in the entertainment world for no other reason then to throw it's weight around in fighting the communist menace . which it unconsciously did more to advance in its own very Un-American and Un-Constituional witch hunts and hearings . David finds his friends in the entertainment industry in a white panic the very first evening , at a welcome home party at his house , when screen writer Larry Noland , Chris Cooper , got into a very heated exchange with his actress wife Dorothy , Patricia Wetting , over him naming names at a secret HUAC hearing . The names that included some of his , and Dorothy's , life long friends in the industry . Called into he office of his boss 20th Century Fox head man Darryl Zanuck , Ben Piazza , David's told that he'll soon be subpoenaed to testify before HUAC and if he values his job in movies , or anywhere else in the entertainment world , he'd better tell them what they want to hear . David is even told to turn in his own wife Ruth , Annette Bennings , as being a member of the Communist Party if that's what they wan't David to do ! Excellent recreation of a period of American History that we'd very well wan't to forget . Robert de Niro is at his very best as the troubled and self-doubting Hollywood director David Merrill who during the entire movie is caught between a rock and a hard place . David is given a way out , by HUCA , to rat out his friends and associates for among other things an anti-Atomic Bomb Peace rally that they attended in 1946 . There's no real winners in the movie " Guilty by Suspicion " with everyone in it from David on down being forced one way or another out of the profession that they chose , creativity in movies books and on the stage , to put all their hearts and souls into . There's poor Dorothy Noland who's career as an actress was destroyed and even had her young son Matthew taken away from her by being falsely accused by her rat-fink husband Larry , working in concert with HUAC , as an unfit mother . With all doors in Hollywood and on Broadway closed to her and never seeing young Matthew again Dorothy started to drink heavily . One evening after saying goodbye to David and Ruth at a restaurant in L . A Dorothy , at the end of her line , got herself smashed on drinks and ended up really getting smashed by killing herself in a car smash-up . The smear-mongering scoundrels of HUAC had the gal to grill David about her , Dorothy , being a communist , which she wasn't , even with her body still warm in her grave ! David for his part , who was anything but a hero up until then , just had enough and threw caution , that his lawyer Felix Graff ( Sam Wanamaker ) told him to have , and his career to the wind and let the Grand Inquisitor Chairman Woods , Gallard Sartain , an his two sneering and sanctimonious deputies Congressmen Tavennar & Veld , Robin Gammell & Brad Sullivan , have it . David tells them : " In the name of ridding the world of Communism you destroyed her life ! Have you no shame in what your doing ! She's DEAD ! " David did indeed become a hero at the end of the movie but not because he wanted to be one but because his conscience and love of country and just plain human decency wouldn't let him be anything else .
What I do know about commies is that I just don't like them	SPOILERS Post WWII Film-Noir spy drama set in New York City with three-time loser and just released pick-pocket artist Skip McCoy , Richard Widmark , lifting a purse that contained an important piece of microfilm off Candy , Jean Peters , on the New York City Subway . Candy thinks that the microfilm is from a rival corporation of her boyfriends employer . What Candy doesn't know is that her boyfriend Joey , Richard Kiley , is a commie spy and that the film is top secret US government information that he's passing off to his commie contacts in the Soviet Union ! Neither does Skip . Superior cold war espionage suspense drama from the 1950's by director Samuel Fuller without the over-the-top super patriotism that was so common in spy movies back in those days . Both Skip and Candy and later police tipster " Moe " Williams , Thelma Ritter , act like normal people caught up with something thats far more dangerous that they at first thought . Candy trying to get the film back from Skip after she's told where he lives , off a pier on the East River , by Moe later realizes that she's helping the communists not her boyfriends corporation and tries to get Skip to return the film to the local police and F . B . I . Skip at first doesn't believe Candy and a he same time is too smart to keep it all in one place which makes it impossible for Candy or anyone else , like Joey & Co , to get all the microfilm at one time . Later Candy , who now realized what she was involved with , after not getting anywhere with Skip in having him return the film to the police knocks him out and returns it to Joey . Candy is helping to set him up with the police by getting Joey to expose his commie contacts . It turns that the most important frame of the microfilm was missing and with that Joey realized that he was being set by Candy and at first brutally beat and then shoots her leaving her for dead . It's then that he made his escape via a dumbwaiter in her apartment killing one of the policemen who was in on the raid . Skip going to the hospital where Candy was recovering realizes that she risked her life by giving Joey his wrong address when he later went to murder Skip and grab the microfilm . Joey after he found that the address that Candy gave him was a lie found out where Moe lived and after not being able to get her to tell him Skip's whereabouts blew her brains out . Moe who was slated to be buried in ' Potter's Field ' ended up getting a proper burial for giving her life in protecting Skip as well as keeping Joey from getting the film to his commie cohorts . Exciting final sequence in the subway with Skip and Joey slugging it out after Joey's gun was lifted by Skip making the fight between the two even . Both Skip and Candy , as well as the doomed Moe , who were at odds with each other at the beginning of the movie realized later that they were all working for the same . Together they put an end to the commie spy ring that Joey was involved with . I really liked the theme song " Again " that Samuel Fuller used that was very effective as well as moving in the romantic scenes in the film between Skip and Candy .
He might have been following the organ grinder but it was the monkey that he was really after	( There are Spoilers ) Almost unbearable at times to watch tear-jerker about a young man working himself up from he slums of New York City as a concert violinist . Then getting involved with a rich socialite who would have never as much as looked at him . Falling in love with the violin at a very young and tender age Paul Boray , John Garfield , wanted nothing more in life then to play his violin to the detriment of his parents grocer Rudy Boray and his wife Esther , J . Carroll Naish & Ruth Nealson . It was Paul's mother Esther that at fist bought him his first violin for his 10th birthday thinking it would make a sensitive and caring person out of little Paul . Esther not wanting her son to be a baseball player like his father Rudy wanted him to be but little did she know that it would turn Paul into a selfish and unfeeling Frankenstein monster instead . Growing into manhood during the Great Depression Paul couldn't bring himself to do any manual work to help out his family during the hard times . Instead he spend hours upon hours practicing his music with the only real friend he had pianist Sid Jeffie's , Oscar Levant , who was almost as crazy as he was when it came to being obsessed with music . Sid also seemed to be immune to the aging process with him not looking a day older from the time when we first saw him when Paul was a little boy to when the movie ended with Paul being a man in is mid 30's ! In fact Sid looked like he was getting younger as Paul was getting older as the movie's chronology moved from the 1920's into the post WWII 1940's . It must have been the liquids that Sid was drinking , water from the fabled Fountain of Youth , during the movie that kept him looking so young . Paul got his big break when Sid invited him to a party gathering of the rich and famous on 5th avenue that was hosted by the filthy rich and blue-blooded socialite Helen Wright , Joan Crawford . It was only when at Sid's insistence , to Paul's disdain , Paul was asked to play his fiddle to the stuff shirts at the party that all hell broke loose . It was after his jaw-dropping performance that , as they say in Paul's old neighborhood on the lower East Side of Manhattan , the rest was " His Story " for the remainder of the movie . With the word of mouth spreading all over New York and places far and wide about Paul's amazing ability to play the violin all the doors to the world of concert music , with the help of the very rich and influential Helen Wright , were suddenly flung open to him . Paul still has that lower East Side combative attitude that no matter how hard he tries he can't shake off . Which in fact make's the classy and refined upper East Side Helen fall heads over heels for the young man even though she's still married , in name only , to her equally rich but not stuck up husband Victor , Paul Cavanagh , who eventually agrees to give Helen a divorce . It doesn't take long for Helen and Paul to become an item in the local gossip columns with the two lovebirds sending all their free time together at Helen's many estates all around the country notably at Helen's waterfront mansion on the Pacific coast . It there that we have a number of really hot scenes between the two making out on the beach with the waves rolling to the the sounds of Paul playing his violin to the music of " Humoresque " the title of the movie . Madly in love with Paul Helen gets a divorce from her husband Victor and now feels that the road is clear for her and Paul to get hitched and live happily ever after in unimaginable , to the common people , wealth and comfort . What Helen doesn't realize is that she has a rival for Paul's love and affection , that's far more formative then any woman , which is Paul's music . In the end it's the music that wins out with Paul leaving Helen all alone drowning in her sorrows in a sea of liquor tears and finally 15 to 20 foot high ocean tidal waves . Even though you wouldn't expect it John Garfield and Joan Crawford who was some six years older , and looked at least ten to her the very youthful-looking co-star in the movie John Garfield , really clicked in all their love scenes together . Paul in the end could not break himself away from his music and even the loss of Helen didn't seem to effect him at all . After a brief period of mourning life and music returned to normal to Paul . Paul was a man who's only purpose in life was to play and perfect and keep perfecting his music . With him being the perfectionist that he is Paul could never be satisfied in what he does no matter how good he does it until death do them , him and his violin , part .
There's no such thing as " Trust " in the spying business	( There are Spoilers ) It's March 1944 and things aren't going that good for the Germans in Europe with them being thrown out of the USSR and desperately holding on to their former alley Italy holding off the allied forces there who are within artillery fire from Rome . With all this going on the Germans need all the help that they can get and they get it in the form of the valet to the Briitish ambassador to Turkey an ambitious civil servant in His Majesty's service Ulyesses Diello , James Mason . Diello has had it with his life that was going nowhere and wanted to make it big and then check out to South America , in Rio De Janeiro , and live like a king but the only way he can pull that off is by spying for the Germans and getting his hands on top secret information . Diello plans to get this secret information from his boss the British ambassador Sir Frederic , Walter Hampden , when he was outside of his office , which seems like all the time , attending as well as entertaining parties and state dinners . Getting in touch with the attaché of the German ambassador to Turkey Count Von Papan , John Wengraf , a guy named L . C Moyzisch , played by Oskar Karlweis , Diello later given the code name , by Ambassador Von Papan , " Cicero " . Diallo Impresses the German diplomat so much that Van Papan get's in touch with Berlin so he can get the go ahead to do business with him but at a price : 20 , 000 in British Pound Sterling . Deillo's plan at first works flawlessly with him getting his hands on every piece of information , that always top secret , that's sent to the British ambassador . Photographing the documents and , after getting paid by the German government , Diello then sends it on to his contact , Moyzisch , in the German embassy . Despite his ability to be secretive Deillo foolishly gets involved with the stateless and almost destitute , the Germans confiscated all her property money and holdings back in Poland , Polish Countess Anna Staviska , Danielle Darrieux . Deillo had the hots for Anna since he met her back in London before the war as her late husbands valet . Being a bit too trustworthy in a business , spying , where trust is a dirty word Diello lets his both pants and guard down and gets it where it hurts him the most both in his wallet and bank account . Diello gets zinged not only by scheming and double-crossing Countess Staviska but the German Government as well , in the end which will , like it did Diello , completely blow you away . Tense filled and exciting movie about spying that has going for it the fact that it was based on a true story where more then anything else we see just how true the saying " Truth is stranger then fiction " really is . Diello has nerves of steel in his nerve-wrecking attempts to get a hold of British Military secrets that if caught can have him take a long walk and short drop at the end of a rope . Manipulating both sides , the German & British , in keeping him alive and free in order to find out whom his contacts are and how much he actually received and sold to both warring parties , the British and Germans , has Deillo playing for high stakes in both money as well as his life . Even though Diello screwed a lot of people in the movie he got the royal screwing in the end with his lover the two-timing Countess Staviska checking out on him and going to neutral Switzerland with all his cash , 130 , 000 Pound Sterling , just when he was about to check out together with her to South America . Diello gets in touch with his contact Moyzisch , whom he'd since discarded , for one last deal in getting him , and his German boss ' , for a cool 100 , 000 Pound Sterling the plan to invade Europe by the allies , Operation Overlord , and open up a second front against Germany later that spring . By sticking his neck out in getting the information from the British ambassador's office safe , that was rigged with an alarm , Diello blew his cover and was now a marked man by both his former employer the British Government as well as his collaborators The Germans . The two were tricked , by the sneaky Countess Staviska , into thinking that Diello was working either for the British or Germans as a double-agent giving both sides bogus information . This miscalculation on the Germans part had them throw away the actual plan by the British and US to invade France in June 1944 which if they believed and acted on it the Germans may well have prevented the allies from invading and conquering Western Europe . At the same time , with a second front no longer a reality , The Germans would have been able to defeat the Red Army and thus win the second World War . One of the best spy films ever made not only because of the superior acting , especially by James Mason as Diello / Cicero , editing and directing . The very fact that it really happened shows just how close Hitler's Germany was in winning the Second World War even as late as the spring of 1944 when most people in the allies camp , both in government and the military , thought that the war was just about over and that Nazi Germany would be defeated by Christmas 1944 at the latest . Nazi Germany in fact held out together with it's Fhurer Adolph Hitler for five more long brutal and bloody months with just the Western Allies alone , the British & Americans , suffering well over 300 , 000 casualties in the desperate , by the defending Germans , and no holds bar , by both sides , battle of Western Germany until the war finally ended in Germanys total defeat in the spring of 1945 .
A Game of Chess	SPOILERS Traveling back to his castle in Scandinavia Christian Knight Antonius Block , Max Von Sydow , has seen enough death and horror in the Crusade that he went on into the Holy Land , where he fought the last ten years . The Crusades took almost all the faith that he had in man as well as his belief in God out of him . Together with his squire , Gunnar Bjornstrand , Block found that his native land as well as the whole of Western Europe is being ravaged by the Black Plague that's destroying even more lives that the Crusades . Block begins to wonder if the plague is God's retribution to man for the evils that he committed over the centuries . Block and his squire have another person traveling with them through the hills and forests and along the coast of Sweden and he was with them throughout their entire journey back home from the hell-fires of the Middle-East Death , Bengt Ekerot . Sensing who he is when Block sees him at the seashore he knows that his time has come but talks him into playing him a game of chess to for stall his eventual demise . Even more to get from Death the knowledge about good and evil and the existence of a God before he ends up at the tip of the Grim Reaper's scythe . The chess game goes on and off throughout the movie " The Seventh Seal " and as long as Block stays in the game he stays alive as well as those who he picked up with him in his going back home to his castle where his lovely wife Karin , Inga Lanogre , is waiting for him . Beautifully and eerily photographed and directed by Igmar Bergman " The Seventh Seal " show us how we can be deceived into thinking that what were told is good can easily turn out to be evil , by those whom we trust and believe in . Like in the case of the many thousands of men like Block who believed enough to be willing to give up their lives for it . Later in the film we see Raval , Bertil Anderbern , stealing the gold and silver jewelry off the dead to enrich himself . Raval was the local religious leader who's fiery speeches to go to Jerusalem and drive the unbelievers out of that holy city and the entire holy land . Reduced to being a Godless grave-robber and unfeeling liar Raval ends up falling victim to the very horror that he profited from in stealing from the dead : the plague . As it begins to look that Death is slowly winning his game of chess with Block and the end is almost near for him he in desperation goes to talk to this young woman , Maud Hansson , who's about to be burned at the stake for being a witch by the local townspeople . Block trying to find out if it's true that she can see and even communicate with the Devil feeling that if the Devil exists God has to exist too . Since one can't exist without the other . Mercyfully giving her a potion that would ease her pain from the torch and fire thats about to engulf her all Block gets from the woman is a mindless and empty stare as she awaits the horror thats about to end her short and so mournful life . " The Seventh Seal " is considered my many to be Bergmans best film and since he made it back in 1956 he never came close to making another motion picture , with the many fine movies that he made over the years since then , as good as it was and still is even now . The movie not only makes you wonder if there's any truth that God as well as good and evil exists but also makes you think about yourself and that final journey into the dark and great unknown that we all eventually will have to travel .
All Is Lost !	Berlin April 1945 : The Red Army has launched it's last great offensive of the Second World War with a massive armored and infantry assault on the German capital . Deep inside a bunker underneath the German Reichstag is the German Fhurer Adolf Hitler , Bruno Ganz , and his general staff conducting the last desperate defense of the city but time is quickly running out with even the most fanatical and optimistic of them , with the exception of Hitler , know that the end is near and are looking to somehow escape from this hell on earth or at least negotiate a surrender with the attacking Soviets forces . It's these historic days during the spring of 1945 that are covered in the movie " Downfall " . Explosive and blood-splattering film with an Acdemy Award caliber performance by Bruno Ganz as the German leader Adolf Hitler as his nation is being clobbered with daily and nightly one thousand plane bombing raids from the air and with millions of allied troops , on two fronts , swarming across it's borders on land putting an end to the Third Reich that he brought into power in Germany back in 1933 . The total pandemonium that struck that city is realistically and graphically depicted in the movie that's based on the memories of Hitler's personal secretary Traudl Junge , Alexandra Maria Lara , who was working for him in that capacity since 1942 . One of the best movies about Hitler ever made has him shown in a very different light then the usual portrayals that were used to seeing him in the scores of films made about Hitler , and WWII , over the years . Wild threatening and hysterical towards his generals when things aren't going right , which in the movie was almost all the time , Hitler showed his " human side " when it came to his personal staff . Insisting that they leave the city before it fell to the dreaded Red Army and also being grateful to them when they refuse and wanted to stay , and kill themselves , along with him when the end came . There's a great scene in the bunker when Hitler realizes that the " great offensive " that he expected by German General Steiner's 9th Army , to smash the Soviets and throw them out of Berlin , never materialized because he , Steiner , didn't have the men and tanks to do the job . Completely losing it and letting his generals have it Hitler at last finally realized , with the later defection of his two top honchos SS leader Himmler & second in command Goering , that the war was lost . Hitler then instead of trying to escape from the doomed city decided to stay at his post , as the German Chief of State , until it's defense was no longer possible then end it all by putting a bullet in his head . Terrifying scenes with blood and guts and body parts flying in all directions with even the Germans themselves , the Army and Nazi Gestapo , shooting hundreds of German soldiers and civilians who were trying to flee the city , to save their lives , for disobeying orders and not standing and fighting to the last man and woman like their Fhurer ordered them to . With all the horrors in the movies " Downfall " the one that struck me most , even though it was very minor compared to the rest of the carnage in the film , was the murder by the Nazi Misnister of Propaganda Joseph Gobbels and his wife Magda , Ulrich Matters & Corinna Harfouch , of their six young children by poisoning them as they were asleep . Determined to both kill themselves the Gobbels ' didn't even want their children to survive the war saying that there's no reason for them to live in a world without National Socialism or their " beloved Fhurer " Adolf Hitler or uncle Adolf as he was efficiently called by them . the movie " Downfall " showed more then anything else how right the Union Civil War General Sherman was in his famous statement " War is Hell " .
Extremely underrated thriller ; Not to be missed	SPOILER ALERT I was surprised looking at the IMDb top 250 movies that " Primal Fear " isn't among them while the more elaborately made and overrated thriller " The Usual Subjects " is listed as # 17 among the all time best in motion picture history . Both movies have narratives that build up to a shocking and surprising ending but the movie " Primal Fear's " ending fits right in with the story that it's presenting and doesn't take anything away from it . While at the same time when you see the movie again for any clues for the surprise ending as hard as you try you can't find them because the ending was , in the true sense of the word , a total surprise . " Primal Fear " is really one of those movies that has a good story that builds up the suspense level with acting and directing and delivers a shocking ending . The film climax not only stuns the audience but makes total sense and doesn't take away anything from the story that you saw up to that point when it hits you . Where as " The Usual Suspects " surprise ending seems totally contrived and completely negates the story that you were seeing up to the part that you were hit by it that the movie plot that you were watching becomes utterly senseless . Marty Vail , Richard Gere , is one of Chicago's top defense attorneys who likes to take on high-profile cases for a hefty fee or Pro-Bono as long as it gets him publicity and embellishes his already envious reputation . Marty also believes that everybody no matter how repulsive their crime , which there accused of deserves to be defended to the utmost of his ability . One morning in a bar watching the TV Vail sees a live news report of the police chasing down a young man who is reported to have murdered a very powerful and popular man from the Catholic Church Archbishop Richard Rushman , Stanley Anderson . Smelling publicity in defending that person , if he's not killed by the police or ends up killing himself , Vail uses his connections to get on the case defending him . At the jail-house talking to the young man Aaron Stampler , Edward Norton , he finds out that he's a 19 year-old altar boy at the church that the Archbishop was in charge of . Stampler tells him that he blacked out , lost time as he puts it , when he came into the Archbishops office when he heard that there was someone else there . Stampler blacked out but when he woke up from his unconscious state he found himself covered with blood and the Archbishop was dead ! Seeing that he just panicked and ran . The state wants the death penalty for Stampler and assigned to prosecute the case Janet Venable , Laura Linney , who once had an affair with Marty Vail and is very surprised that Vail is handling the case for Stampler's defense . Before he's to go on trial when Stampler is examined by a defense paid psychiatrist Dr . Molly Arrington , Frances McDormand . It's then discovered that he has a split personality and is not in control of himself when his other self takes over his mind and he becomes " Roy " , a completely different and violent person ! Marty Vail later also finds this out the hard and brutal way about Stampler's condition by being banged around by " Roy " . It's determined by Dr . Arrington that Sampler is a very sick person and should get help in a mental hospital not in a prison but since the trial is already on Vail can't change the plea from not guilty to innocent by reason of insanity . Vail later finds out that Stampler was sexually abused by the Archbishop by tracking down a video tape with the Archbishop having Stampler and other altar boys and girls engage in sexual activities while he watched . The tape would not only be very embarrassing to the church but to a lot of high powerful people in the city and state government if it were released . Vail sends a copy of the tape to the prosecutor , Miss . Venable , so it would force her to use it at the trial . At the trial State Prosecutor Venable has the tape played , to the total shock of those in the courtroom , to show that Stampler had cause and reason to murder the Archbishop . Just as Vail expected , by releasing the tape to Venable , the case starts to backfire against her . It's then when Vail puts Aaron Stampler on the stand to be cross-examined by Miss . Venable who aggressive and belligerently questions him on the archbishops murder he goes completely berserk . " Roy " takes over Aaron's mind and attacks Miss . Venable and almost ends up breaking her neck . Everybody decides , the Judge as well as the prosecution , that Stampler is insane and not responsible for his actions and drops the murder case against him . I's agreed that he needs to be in a mental hospital and not in a state prison ; but the story is not over for the movies shocking and surprising ending is just about to happen . One of the best crime / court dramas ever made with outstanding performances by , of course , Edward Norton , Richard Gere , Laura Linney and everyone else involved with the acting in the movie . Don't miss seeing it you won't be disappointed , you'll be rewarded with one of the best crime / court dramas and surprise ending movies of all time .
