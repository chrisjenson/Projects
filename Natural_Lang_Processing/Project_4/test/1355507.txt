Awful .	Blood Predator starts as a small plane full of people on holiday heads towards Yosemite National Park in California , however during bad whether the plane is forced to crash land in the wilderness miles from anywhere . There are seven survivors , married couples John ( Bill Devlin ) & Sandy ( Merry Simkins ) plus Tom ( Mark Irvingsen ) & Barb ( Rayne Aspengren ) along with snowboarder Zak ( Jared Cohn ) & his girlfriend Jennifer ( Mary Dignan ) & rounding things off is lesbian Caren ( Jackie Freed ) . Deciding they need to get out of the freezing whether they come across a seemingly deserted house with a ski mobile , unfortunately it doesn't work so they then decide to stay at the house & wait for help . Little do they realise that alien creatures have invaded the house & have eaten the previous occupant's , the seven survivors soon end up on the menu . . . Written , produced & directed by Paul Gagné at the time of me writing this comment Blood Predator has no other ' User Comments ' or ' External Reviews ' on the IMDb although in the fullness of time as it becomes widely available that will undoubtedly change . It also only has five ' User Ratings ' with three IMDb users giving a lowly 1 star ( six now if you count me ) & two insane users giving it an astonishing , I'm sorry but the day when a piece of crap film such as Blood Predator is worthy of a flawless is the day civilisation as we know it collapses . There are so many things utterly awful & inept about Blood Predator it's hard to know where to begin or indeed stop for that matter . First the character's , there are two types of character's in Blood Predator . Annoying & very annoying . They are really awful clichés of the poorest sort , apart from a few random clichéd lines to flesh them out these people are just there to make up the numbers . The dialogue is awful & sometimes contradicts itself , for instance after shooting an alien one character triumphantly claims that ' it's dead ' at which point someone replies ' are you sure ' to which he says back ' it's impossible to tell ' . Just think about that short dialogue exchange , it's a total contradiction within the space of five seconds isn't it ? At first the guy is sure it's dead & then in virtually the same sentence claims it's impossible to know if it's dead . That's just one example of the badly written & thought out dialogue , trust me there are other's . Then there's the fact that Blood Predator is so slow & boring , for the first seventy minutes nothing happens . Why don't the aliens attack ? What are they doing exactly ? If they strip human beings to the bone ( lots of bones found in the basement ) & eat the flesh why didn't they eat Zak the snowboarder ? They killed him & placed his body outside the front door so the other's would find it , why ? Look I could go on all day about how bad Blood Predator is but there's a word limit & I really can't be bothered even thinking about it any more . Director Gagné obviously had no money & doesn't have much of anything else either . We are supposed to believe that these plane crash survivors are snowed in but if you look at the scene when they first find the house the ground is perfectly dry without a single snow flake anywhere to be seen , now you could accept this & say the snow cleared up but then why do they spend so much time trying to fix the snow mobile ? They could just literally walk & if you look at the scene when they start the snow mobile & how slow it is it probably would have been quicker to walk ! There's just no snow on the ground or lying on the branches of trees or any sign that they are snowed in . It's a huge continuity problem that is just laughable when seen on screen , it destroys the whole plot & it's impossible to take the film seriously . There's barely any gore , there's some blood splatter , an alien sticks it's tongue through a girls chest , there's a decapitated head & hand & that's it . The special effects are terrible , the CGI alien ant things don't look anything like the real life on set rubber puppet which is so static & lacks any sort of movement . According to the IMDb Blood Predator had a budget of about $250 , 000 which actually sounds quite a lot considering what ended up on screen . Quite literally noting happens for the first seventy minutes for God's sake . It seems to have been shot on a video camcorder with most of it being filmised although there are still shots which are clearly video . The acting is pretty bad . Blood Predator is a truly awful , awful film in every way both conceptually & technically . Seriously this is the kind of film that makes you want to stop watching films altogether , definitely one to avoid & don't believe the ratings as it was probably the director & his mum who voted . Think Return of the Aliens : The Deadly Spawn ( 1983 ) rip-off only much , much worse .
I hate this film , the sort of film that gives horror a bad name .	Elaine Barlow ( Cheryl Black ) runs a complex of cabins on a small island with her husband Frank and is having an affair with Vic Carlton ( Bob Wagner ) . One night while Frank is supposed to be on the mainland he catches them together in one of the cabins . A fight breaks out , Frank is knocked unconscious and in an unfortunate accident involving an oil lamp the cabin is burned to the ground with Frank still inside . Fast forward an unknown amount of time , Vic and Elaine are now married and they have rebuilt the cabins and plan to reopen to the public . They advertise the island as ' Honeymoon Cove ' . They are expecting their first guests , three recently married couples who are Kay ( Margi Curry ) and Jeff ( Paul Inwanski ) , Sue ( Kari Addington ) and Gary ( James Caskey ) plus Linda ( Leslie McKinley ) and Dwayne ( Philip Thompson ) . Before they arrive three of their friends Kelly ( Jane Pardue ) , Robin and Jill ( Jillian Raye ) turn up and ask Elaine and Vic if they can decorate their cabins as a surprise . One of the girls find the maid Emily ( Megan Ready ) dead in a closet and she herself is killed , as are the rest of the trio . The couples arrive on ' Honeymoon Cove ' and are given their cabins and settle down for the night . Things start to turn sour as they find the remains of their friends and realise they are being stalked by an unknown killer . Vic tries to contact the mainland and inform the Sheriff ( Bill Pecchi ) and his Deputy ( Jerry Meagher ) but finds the radio's antenna broken , the small and only pier on the island is set alight and is destroyed along with the only boat . The remaining survivors are trapped on the island until help arrives in the morning . But will they live that long ? Who could the killer possibly be ? Maybe the retarded caretaker who can't speak named ' Crazy Joe ' ( Micheal Wycoff ) ? Or is it someone less obvious ? You can probably guess , that opening sequence isn't there for the hell of it you know . Written and directed by Harry Preston ( although there is an ' Additional sequences by ' credit ) this slasher film has no redeeming qualities at all , quite simply it's awful in every single aspect of it's 90 minute running time . It feels much longer than 90 minutes . I just sat there hoping , in vain as it turned out , that something , anything exciting would happen but it never did . The film as a whole is really slow and boring . It takes great efforts to try and keep the killers identity secret but there are no suspects apart from the obvious and you can guess the killer within the first 5 minutes . The gore is none existent , a bit of blood and a fake axe stuck to the top of someones head is about it but there are no special effects to talk about . The acting is consistently terrible , and that fat ' comedy relief ' Sheriff is the most annoying and useless character in a film that I've come across in a while . On a technical level the film is generally very poor and a bit of an eyesore to watch . There are much better slasher films out there , don't even consider sitting through this lame incredibly boring mess . A sorry excuse for a film that I thought was the pits and has nothing to recommend it . Everyone involved in making this crap should be embarrassed . For masochists and insomniacs only . Trust me , this is definitely one to avoid .
As terrible as they come .	Ghoulies IV starts in a museum storage facility where PVC & leather clad blonde Alexandra ( Stacie Randall ) is looking for a ancient jewel , after offing various guards she summon the demon Faust who she worships & wants to have sex with , unfortunately she lost the jewel so he's not very happy & orders her to get the last remaining one . . . Which belongs to Jonathan Graves ( returning from the original Ghoulies ( 1985 ) Peter Liapis ) who is experienced in demonic possession & stuff like that after the events of the original Ghoulies . Alexandra sets about finding the jewel so she can bring Faust to Earth permanently from the ' other side ' to , well I don't know actually . Erm , that's about it really . . . Directed by Jim Wynorski whose very name name sends shivers down my spine when it's attached to a film I'm about to waste 90 minutes of my life on Goulies IV is as I expected complete , total & utter crap from start to finish & it's as simple & straight forward as that . The , ahem , ' script ' , cough , by Mark Sevi has virtually nothing in common with the other Ghoulies film except in it's title & that they managed to convince Liapis to reprise his role which also has the added bonus of big able to use footage from the original even though it has no relevance whatsoever . The story is almost none existent , the whole film is a real chore to watch , it's incredibly boring & moronic , it's slow , it's predictable , it's squeaky clean as far as blood or gore goes & it has two comic relief goblins whom I assume are supposed to fill the Ghoulies quota even though they look nothing like they did in the previous films & are in fact just embarrassing to watch , in fact I think they were practising to be ventriloquist's during most of the film as when they speak their mouth's don't move . . . You know I don't want to talk or think about Ghoulies IV anymore so please believe me when I say this is one huge piece of crap of Elephant sized proportions , don't waste either your time or money . Dirctor Wynorski turns in a throughly rotten film on just about every level , the special effects are terrible as is the whole film . Apparently Ghoulies IV is meant to be some sort of horror comedy but it misses both targets by the proverbial mile & it is neither funny nor scary . The best thing about this film is actress Randall in her PVC & leather outfit running around trying to find the jewel & that's hardly worth sitting through this rubbish to see . There's a half decent runaway car scene with a few crashes but it looks like it was edited in from a completely different film & given Wynorski's track record I'm sure it was . Forget about any gore as there isn't any . Technically Ghoulies IV sucks , it's obvious it had & low budget but that simply isn't an excuse for it to be this bad , is it ? Liapis is back in the cast although he probably wishes he'd stayed away , PVC clad babe Randall is easily the best thing about this film which says a lot . Ghoulies IV is crap , there's nothing else to say really . I honestly can't see anyone who enjoy films getting anything out of this , I just can't . I can't believe that I'm going to recommend the original Ghoulies over anything but it's going to happen now because even though that's crap as well it's a hell of a lot better than Ghoulies IV , one to avoid folks & you can thank me later . The things I sit through so you don't have to , honestly . . .
" We just landed on monster island . " Awful , awful , awful , avoid at all costs .	The Curse of the Komodo starts on an isolated island near Hawaii as an army special forces operation is secretly taking place which ends up with them all being killed by a huge genetically engineered Komodo . The army have gotten cold feet over the experiment & orders the project leader Professor Nathan Phipps ( William Langlois ) & his assistant Dr . Dawn Porter ( Gail Harris ) back to the island to destroy all evidence of the experiment that was designed to produce huge genetic mutations to used as weapons against the enemy . . . Meanwhile thieves Drake ( Paul Logan ) , Tiffany ( Melissa Brasselle ) & Reece ( Cam Newlim ) make good their escape in a chopper after robbing a casino but they run into bad weather & their pilot Jack ( Tim Abell ) has to land anywhere he can & in one of the film only type coincidences they land on Komodo island . They meet up with Phipps his daughter Rebecca ( Glori-Anne Gilbert ) & Porter who are protected by armed guards Jason ( Jay Richardson ) , Hanson ( Ted Monte ) & Blake ( J . P . Davis ) . Things quickly spiral out of control as the huge Komodo begins to systematically eat everyone in sight , will any of them survive ? Directed by Jim Wynorski as Jay Andrews The Curse of the Komodo is one awful creature feature & just a downright terrible film . The script by Steve Latshaw is predictably rubbish , the rules for this type of film aren't hard to follow are they ? You have your isolated location & stranded monster food , there's the giant dinosaur , genetically engineered creature or alien or whatever to eat the cast members one-by-one & the corrupt military involvement to introduce lots of guns & weaponry , simple right ? Well not to Mr . Latshaw & Wynorski as The Curse of the Komodo fails in every department , there isn't one positive thing I can say about this film . The character's are boring cardboard stereotypical clichés the least about whom the better . The Komodo barely does anything & why did the military create giant Komodo lizards in the first place ? Maybe they could have genetically engineered a huge hamster or something docile & cuddly , it would have been easier to control if anything went wrong , right ? The film is really slow , dull & very boring as it's over forty minutes before the Komodo even shows up ( not counting the opening sequence ) . The attack scenes are dull , unexciting & repetitive as the giant Komodo just stands there as our cast of humans just shoot at it for what seems like ages as their guns never run out of ammo . I have an intense dislike for films like The Curse of the Komodo , it's boring , poorly written & it's a film of absolutely no redeeming qualities . If the military had no conscience about napalming the island why didn't they do that to start with instead of sending in two scientists ? It would have saved a lot of time , trouble & pain for everyone involved especially us the poor viewer having to sit through this crap ! Director Wynorski has made over sixty of these low budget horror / sci-fi films & to be fair he knows how to make a film , unfortunately he doesn't know how to make a good film . The special effects are terrible , the plotting is awful , the logic is absurd , it rips off various other films & as a whole The Curse of the Komodo is seriously crap . Forget about any sort of gore or violence , the Komodo only eats one person on screen & even then just to their legs . Technically the film isn't too bad but it's all rather bland & forgettable . The acting is pretty bad & I didn't think the women were good looking enough either , Anne Gilbert gets her breasts out but that's about it . The Curse of the Komodo is total rubbish , it provides no entertainment value whatsoever & there are far better creature feature films out there . This is not a sequel to & has nothing to do with the film Komodo ( 1999 ) which is far better than this . According to the IMDb Komodo Vs . Cobra ( 2005 ) directed by Wynorski is in post-production , I shudder at the mere thought of it .
When is an episode of Quincy not an episode of Quincy ?	Quincy M . E . : Has Anbody Here Seen Quincy ? sees Los Angeles coroner & chief medical examiner Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) having car trouble , he just can't make it into work . Dr . Asten ( John S . Ragin ) exasperated , he then gets a visit from the chief coroner Dr . Hiro ( Yuki Shimoda ) who Lt . Monahan ( Garry Walberg ) has personally asked to perform an autopsy on a body flown in from Italy which he suspects is being used to smuggle millions of dollars of diamonds into the country . As Dr . Hiro runs around trying to sort various problems out things get more & more complicated . . . Episode 7 from season 2 this Quincy story was directed by Steven Hilliard Stern & I really hated it , in fact it's one of only two Quincy episodes I would never watch again . First lets take a look at the title which is in the form of a question , Has Anbody Here Seen Quiny ? Well actually yes , in fact I would go as far as to say that I have seen every episode of Quincy that was ever made more than once so the answer to the question is a definite yes . When I sit down to watch an episode of Quincy I expect at the very least to see Quincy involved in some capacity & usually he always is , however the one exception to that rule is Has Anybody Seen Quincy ? since Quincy doesn't appear in the episode at all & as such this episode has the distinction of being the only one in the entire eight seasons not to feature Jack Klugman as Quincy except during the opening titles . So there's no Quincy , right . Instead we get a annoying little Japanese coroner who speaks very slowly often in silly little proverbs & phrases with an irritating accent . Not pleasant . This guy isn't even second rate Quincy , he's more like twentieth rate Quincy . When I want to watch an episode of Quincy I expect him to be in it , if I didn't want to watch an episode of Quincy I would just turn the telly over / the DVD off so the fact the production team give us a Quincy free episode is neither here nor there . Dr . Hiro is awful , Quincy is fantastic . Dr . Hiro in an episode equals crap , Quincy in an episode equals entertaining . Here Dr . Hiro gets caught up in several bitty little sub plots none of which are particularly interesting , a young boy is poisoned by cigarette butts ( how , you can't get poisoning from sucking on a cigarette butt otherwise everyone who has ever smoked a cigarette would be dead ) , a woman who was brought into the morgue but wasn't dead is never explained ( I mean how did the Hospital pronounce her dead in the first place ? ) & capturing some diamond thieves for the LAPD even though he doesn't actually do anything & the thieves come to him . I am not happy about Quincy's situation either , I mean Los Angeles as a city isn't that big you know & besides hasn't he ever heard of the bus ? Or the train ? Then again he does have two legs that he can walk on doesn't he ? He didn't have to miss the whole day , he could found his way into work & put in a few hours , right ? Most of the regulars have a fair amount of screen time but none more so than usual , the guy who plays Dr . Hiro is awful & his jive talking chauffeur is irritating . Has Anbody Seen Quincy ? is right down there with the very work Quincy episodes ever made , it's awful & doesn't feature Quincy which for me is an absolute minimum requirement for a Quincy episode . This Japanese Hiro guy doesn't even make a decent replacement , to me this isn't an episode of Quincy .
" It might be nice to have a future , even a petty little one . " Absolutely awful 50's monster film .	Beast from Haunted Cave is set in a ski resort & on the snowy slopes somewhere in South Dakota called ' Happiness Lodge ' where a quartet of thieves , Alexander Ward ( Frank Wolff ) , Gypsy Boulet ( Sheila Noonan ) , Marty Jones ( Richard Sinatra ) & Byron Smith ( Wally Campo ) , intend to rob the local bank & use an explosion in an old mine shaft as a diversion before making their getaway across country on ski's , sounds foolproof right ? Well wrong because Gil Jackson ( Michael Forset ) their ski instructor becomes suspicious of the quartet & when Byron plants the explosives in the mine his date Natalie ( Linne Ahlstrand ) is taken by a hideous spider creature thing which , as an experience , leaves him a gibbering wreck . To add to their worries as they hide out in a remote cabin owned by Gil waiting for their getaway ride the monster reappears intent on making meals out of them all . . . Apparently a remake of Naked Paradise ( 1957 ) & directed by Monte Hellman Beast from Haunted Cave is a low budget Corman quickie that really doesn't have much to recommend it by . The script by Charles B . Griffith is really slow , has lots of padding to fill the minutes out & doesn't offer any surprises . Beast from Haunted Cave can't quite decide what it wants to be & as such tries to mix a crime thriller with horror . A mix which , in this case , is far from successful . There are just so many instances of boring conversations , people walking around doing nothing ion particular & the monster itself barely makes an appearance until the final five or so minutes . The character's are unlikable & there's annoyingly named brother & sister Gil & Jill ( how would they know who their parents were talking to ? ) . Director Hellman does nothing to add any sort of style or excitement to the dull proceedings . Only the monsters cocooned victims offer any sort of effective horror . He wisely hides the monster until the end where , when finally seen , looks like a guy with a blanket over his head & a few spider legs sticking out of him . It ain't going to impress anyone these days although if you have a thing for actors in dumb looking monster suits then you may find something here to enjoy . Technically Beast from Haunted Cave isn't as bad as it could have been , silly monster apart . It's reasonably well made , the black and white cinematography is decent enough & the locations are nice enough . The acting is generally wooden although not as bad as in some of these types of films . Beast from Haunted Cave is a real bore to sit through , the monster is barely seen or used & as a whole the film doesn't have any redeeming features . Only die hard 50's monster film fans need apply , everyone should try their best to avoid it .
Awful Sc-Fi Channel ' Creature Feature ' Swamp Thing rip-off .	Swamp Devil starts as city girl Melanie Blaine ( Cindy Sampson ) gets a phone call from a guy named Jimmy Fuller ( Nicolas Wright ) who claims to have known her when they were young children in Melanie's home town of Gibbington , Jimmy pleads with Melanie to come back to Gibbington to see her father Howard ( Bruce Dern ) who is dying . Although Melanie hasn't been in Gibbington for twenty odd years she feels she should make the effort to be with her father so she drives up there where she discovers that her father Howard isn't dying at all & in fact he is wanted for the brutal murder of a teenage girl . The local Sheriff ( James Kidnie ) & a posse of local men are on the hunt for Howard who is hiding out somewhere in the vast local swamps & marshes , Melanie decides to stick around to find her father but there's more going on that at first appears . Was all the crazy talk of monsters living in the woods by Howard just trying to shift the blame from himself or is there more to it than that ? This Canadian production was the third & to date final Sci-Fi Channel ' Creature Feature ' directed by David Winning after he had previously directed the equally awful Something Beneath ( 2007 ) & Black Swarm ( 2007 ) , unfortunately it's not so much a case of third time lucky as third time even worse than the first two . I suppose in broad terms one could say Swamp Devil is a cross between Swamp Thing ( 1982 ) with it's similar sounding title & similar looking monster made from swamp weed or branches or whatever it is & A Nightmare on Elm Street ( 1984 ) with the central concept of a brutal child murderer being killed by vigilantes ( including the local Sheriff ) & coming back for revenge although one also has to say that Swamp Devil is as bad a cheap ' Creature Feature ' as you can imagine . I have seen so many of these things I am beginning to wonder why I bother watching them as they are all generally awful from rubbish scripts that are very predictable & make no sense ( there's absolutely no explanation whatsoever as to why or how the killer was resurrected as a Swamp Thing rip-off , there's no reason given as to why it can't cross the county boundary & there's no reason why it hasn't already killed Howard ( I mean he's been running from this thing for twenty odd years ? Why didn't he just move house ? ) ) to clichéd cardboard cutout character's ( a typical local Sheriff , one character who know's about the monster but no-one else believes them ) to forgettable dialogue to yet more truly awful CGI computer effects work that render any of the scenes with the monster laughable . The pace is slow , the film is boring & apart from some dull mystery elements that are easy to work out Swamp Devil really doesn't have much , if anything , going for it . The one thing that might have saved Swamp Devil was some good solid exploitation but unfortunately this is pretty much PG rated stuff all the way with only one scene featuring any blood when someone has possessed vines poked through his leg & shoulder very briefly , otherwise Swamp Devil doesn't feature a single drop of blood . The CGI computer effects are mostly poor , the actual Swamp Devil creature itself when seen looks terrible & has very awkward stiff animation although I will say the possessed vines effects are quite good . The end is very poorly shot & edited with the viewer having to guess what is going on most of the time . There's nothing scary here & apart from the opening & closing sequences it's set entirely in the day which doesn't help the atmosphere , I mean a nice dark spooky swamp at night would be a perfect place to set a horror film but during the day it just doesn't have the same sort of ominous feel . With a supposed budget of about $2 , 000 , 000 one wonders where all the money went , there's an exploding pick-up truck at the end but apart from that nothing happens & you can't tell me those CGI effects cost that much . Although set in the deep south in the US this was filmed in Montréal in Québec in Canada . Most of these ' Creature Features ' have at least one name actor & here it's the turn of the Oscar nominated Bruce Dern , Cindy Sampson as Melanie does alright & it helps that she's quite hot . Swamp Devil is another faceless Sci-Fi Channel ' Creature Feature ' the likes of which sort of melt into one another , basically if you have seen a few of these ' Creature Features ' before then you have seen Swamp Devil & the lack of any sort of gore or explanations for the events contained within doesn't help matters .
" I can't have you wondering around the countryside chopping up the population ! " Hammer took their Frankenstein franchise in a different direction and failed miserably .	We start in school as a young Victor Frankenstein ( Ralph Bates ) is bored and decides looking at anatomy sketches would be more fun at which his teacher ( Neil Wilson ) is offended by . Arriving home at his Castle , Victor finds his Father , Baron Frankenstein ( George Belbin ) has just had sex with the 16 ( ! ) year old housekeeper Alys ( Kate O'Mara , who was actually 31 when she made this ) . After a bit of cheek and sexual innuendo aimed at his Father Victor asks him if he can go to University in Vienna to further his studies . He Father says no and that he shouldn't be so interested in science at his young age , and adds " you'll see me in my grave before I let you go gallivanting off to Vienna for a couple of years " . Victor ' fixes ' his Fathers hunting rifles which backfires killing him while out shooting . Victor gets his wish and goes to University in Vienna . Unfortunately , once there he manages to get the Deans ( James Cossins ) daughter pregnant . After the Dean starts to talk about marriage Victor decides to head back home , and convinces his friend Wilhelm Kassner ( Graham James ) to join him so they can continue their studies and experiments back at his Castle in his Laboratorty . While on horseback travelling Victor and Wilhelm stumble across a gang of highwaymen robbing one of Victor's old school friends Elizabeth Heiss ( Veronica Carlson ) and her Father Professor Heiss ( Bernard Archard ) . They intervene and save them by shooting two of the highwaymen . Once he is alone with the bodies Victor cuts one of their heads off with a large knife . Back at his Castle he finds Alys is still the housekeeper , Victor picks up where his Father left off by having sex with her on a regular basis . Victor and Wilhelm continue their experiments , and after successfully bringing a Tortoise back to life Victor decides to try his hand at something a bit more ambitious . He hires a local grave robber ( Denis Price ) who makes his wife ( Joan Rice ) do all the work and dig up the bodies , to provide him with the necessary parts . Using the various body parts delivered to him , Victor creates a human being but needs one more ingredient before it's complete , a fresh human brain . He manages to bring the stitched together monster ( David Prowse ) to life , but because of an accident the brain was damaged by shards of glass and renders Victor's creation near uncontrollable and extremely violent . The problems mount for Victor as his friend Wilhelm gets cold feet over the experiments , an old friend Lt . Becker ( Jon Finch ) starts to poke around as he investigates various murders around the Castle , Alys tries to blackmail him and he has the added hassle of having Elizabeth move into the Castle when her house is repossessed as he sets about trying to control the monster to do his bidding . Co-written and directed by Jimmy Sangster this was the sixth film in Hammer's Frankenstein series and was made between Frankenstein must be Destroyed ( 1969 ) and Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell ( 1973 ) . I personally thought this was a pretty poor film . Hammer have seemed to abandoned all the things that worked so well in the other Frankenstein films , the sets look cheap , tacky and like their made from cardboard . The music credited to Malcolm Williamson doesn't even try to be scary or build tension as it instead comes across as silly especially whenever the monster is on screen . I felt the film didn't have the atmosphere or vibe about it that many Hammer horror films do . The worse part of this film is the script by Sangster and Jeremy Burnham which plays more like a comedy than a horror . When Victor tells the grave robber that he needs fresh body parts he replies " anything I bring you would get past the Government meat inspectors " . When Victor reanimates a severed arm he makes it stick two fingers up , Victor quips " I think I'll send it to the Dean as a going away present " . There is a scene where Victor invites Elizabeth and her Father to dinner , at this point Victor needs a brain and on his anatomy diagram he has marked it down as ' 25 ' . While sat opposite him Victor sees a ' 25 ' written in black felt pen on the Professor's forehead ! Needless to say it looks incredibly silly . Frankenstein in this film comes across as a spoiled , arrogant , cheeky and wise-cracking little sod . Far removed from Peter Cushing's dignified portrayal of the character . And as for Kate O'Mara being passed off as a 16 year servant , well forget it Sangster and one more thing would you like to buy a bridge I have for sale in London ? There is no sex , nudity , blood , gore or violence as it's all merely hinted at and one or two quick shots of various severed limbs , that's your lot . Hammer have made much better Frankenstein films so make sure you avoid this one and see one of those instead . Disappointing , and strays too far from it's roots .
" Do you know why divorce is so expensive ? Because it's worth it . " Rubbish .	Saquatch Mountain , also known as Devil on the Mountain which is what I saw it under , is set in a small rural backwoods American town where a young woman named Erin ( Cerina Vincent ) is drifting through on her way to a new life somewhere , not that that matters though because while driving along Erin is involved in an accident with a gang of bank robbers lead by a guy named Travis ( Craig Wasson ) , in an ensuing gunfight with the local Sheriff ( Rance Howard ) the gang kidnap Erin & flee into the forest with the local law enforcement in close pursuit . However there is something that lives in the forest , something that isn't human & the crooks & police are forced to work together to try & survive , but is it enough ? Directed by Steven R . Monroe Sasquatch Mountain is a pretty terrible film all round almost as if there weren't enough really bad low budget horror films already . The boring script by Michael Worth takes itself far too seriously & tries to mix the basic ' criminals on the run encounter all sorts of horrors ' taken from From Dusk Till Dawn ( 1996 ) & the basic killer Bigfoot scenario from the much , much better Night of the Demon ( 1980 ) both of which I think are throughly excellent films by the way & a hell of a lot better than Sasquatch Mountain which is crap . Anyway , there are lots of problems with Sasquatch Mountain , from the basic concept which is pretty bad in itself to the truly awful character's including a getaway driver for a bank job who would rather go down on a pretty girl than actually wait outside the bank ( actually when you put it like that . . . ) for his mates who are shooting the place up , then there's the inevitable in-fighting & petty arguing rather than working together as a team to survive & an annoying British guy who I just wanted to die . I have to mention the ending which is terrible in itself , I think it's meant to be all ' emotional ' but it comes across as just embarrassing . Then there's the fact it's incredibly dull , boring & predictable , not much really happens & there's an unforgivable lack of horror or gore or anything that might keep you awake . It's all rather obvious , it felt like the thing went on for hours & in my opinion it basically has zero entertainment value . Director Monroe makes this thing even more annoying to watch as he uses all sorts of editing tricks like most of the time when the creature is on screen the picture goes very blurry , he uses slow-motion , there's some highly annoying & somewhat dizzying shots where he insists on spinning the camera 360 degrees around people for little reason , the whole film seems to lack colour so it's quite drab to watch & the creature ends up looking like a gorilla more than anything else . Forget about any gore as there isn't any . With a supposed budget of about $800 , 000 the makers of Sasquatch Mountain didn't have the biggest budget ever but having said that it's still a terrible film . One of the most disappointing things about Sasquatch Mountain is that the always fantastic Lance Henriksen is in it , the guys just class , he deserves better & it's a shame that he's making films like this . Apart from him the acting from everyone else is poor . Sasquatch Mountain is a terrible straight-to-TV piece of rubbish that I got no enjoyment or entertainment from at all & it's as simple & straight forward as that . One to avoid .
More low budget horror crap .	Feral starts on Highway Forty-Five where a lot of animals have been disappearing recently & their mutilated bodies turning up shortly after , the local Sheriff ( Louis Dupuy ) is on the case . Willing to help him are a young couple named Stacey ( composer , producer & director Merill Capps ) & Michelle ( Sheena Dodds ) who live on Highway Forty-Five in a glorified shed but their help turns to desperation when their own baby daughter Sarah ( Elizabeth Poirrier ) is abducted herself without a single trace of who or what did it . . . Co-directed by actor , composer & producer Merill Capps along with editor , writer & producer Britt Pitre I thought this was pretty bad . The script by Pitre which takes itself extremely seriously isn't what you might expect , if your looking for a straight froward horror about something nasty in the woods then forget it because Feral isn't it . Almost the entire running time of Feral is devoted to Stacey & Michelle & their attempts at getting their daughter back & the emotional strain of the situation which leads to Stacey accidentally shooting someone which starts a chain of events which include lies , kidnapping & murder as they will do anything to stay together as a family & find Sarah . As far as the ' thing ' in the woods go we never see it , we never find out what it is & is almost inconsequential . Oh & if that wasn't dull enough there are loads of shots of people walking around the woods late at night , there is barely any dialogue to speak of , probably a few conversations throughout the entire film which gives it a gritty minimalist feel but also means you never feel like you know these people or care for them as we learn next to nothing about anyone & there seems to little or no reasoning behind the odd decisions made by Stacey & Michelle . It goes on for too long , not enough happens either & who the hell was that old guy with the beard who had that video camera set-up ? Director's Capps & Pitre obviously haven't made a film before , I'm not exaggerating when I say half this film is spent outside in the woods where it's so dark you literally cannot see a thing . I watched this on VHS so maybe a DVD release would be clearer but even so there were many occasions where the entire screen was black . There are no scares although to it's credit it has some tension & atmosphere but that doesn't save it from being rubbish . There's no real gore either , there are some puddles of blood , some bones & skulls with gore still attached & a scene when Stacey & Michelle supposedly cut someone up but this is achieved by using joints of meat from a local butcher & you never see anything graphic . With a supposed budget of about $65 , 000 this actually looks alright , I can't believe I just described a film as looking alright when half of it was so dark you can't see what's going on but when you can see what's going on it does indeed look alright if you get what I mean . The acting is actually pretty strong although the lack of dialogue or character development meant I never really cared for them so it didn't matter in the end . Feral is a total waste of time , there is no horror here & feels like a drama more often than not & that's when you can actually see what's happening on screen which isn't as often as it should be . I don't know who Feral would appeal to , I didn't like it & wouldn't want to watch it again therefore I can only give it .
I really hated this .	The Exorcism of Emily Rose starts on a rural US farm where a county medical examiner ( Terence Kelly ) pronounces nineteen year old Emily Rose ( Jennifer Carpenter ) dead & says he can't be sure that she died of natural causes . After examining the evidence about how Emily died shortly after an exorcism performed by Father Richard Moore ( Tom Wilkinson ) the district attorney ( Julian Christopher ) decides to charge him with negligent manslaughter . Ethan Thomas ( Campbell Scott ) handles the prosecution while ambitious attorney Erin Bruner ( Laura Linney ) is assigned to to the defence but she has her work cut out as the prosecution calls in numerous doctors & scientists saying that Emily needed proper medical treatment & that her supposed possession was down to epileptic fits & psychosis . Bruner feels her only chance of success is not to disprove the strong medical evidence but to prove demonic possession & that therefore an exorcism was the only thing that could have saved Emily . Co-written & directed by Scott Derrickson I have to say that I hated The Exorcism of Emily Rose with a passion , there are films which just rub you up the wrong way & almost make you want to hate them from the story to the character's to the pacing to the production values & The Exorcism of Emily Rose definitely falls into that category for me . Right , to begin with anyone who goes into The Exorcism of Emily Rose expecting a straight horror film rip-off of The Exorcist ( 1973 ) will be sorely disappointed , this plays more like the dullest & most boring episode of L . A . Law ( 1986 - 1994 ) you could possibly imagine . So basically what we have here is a courtroom drama & supernatural horror film mix of The Exorcist & L . A . Law , doesn't that just sound wonderful ? To cut straight to the chase The Exorcism of Emily Rose fails miserably as both courtroom drama & horror in my opinion , the horror is lifted directly from The Exorcist with a teenage girl possessed by an evil demonic spirit , she is tied to her bed while the exorcism is performed , there's the bodily contortions & she even speaks in an ancient language she couldn't possibly know . Trust me you've seen it all before . Then there's the courtroom angle which is no better , a courtroom drama succeeds on it's twists & turns but here there are none with very linear flashbacks that support only the defence & make it all to clear what happened . There doesn't seem to be any middle or opposing ground . Where's the opposing viewpoint of the prosecution ? The film leaves one in no doubt about what happened & that it tries to suggest possession is real & the whole message about opening up to other possibilities besides scientific ones has been done before & isn't anything new . Then there are the character's , Emily is barely seen & we never get to know her , her family aren't even given names , Father Moore is underdeveloped & Erin Bruner is just such an unlikable character I wanted to kick my telly whenever she appeared . A lot has been made of the fact that The Exorcism of Emily Rose was based on a true story , that of a young German girl named Annelises Michel in 1976 ( suspiciously not long after the original The Exorcist was released . . . ) who also died because of neglect after an exorcism . This film & that case have little in common , the country the story takes place in is different , there's almost thirty years difference in the setting & every single name has been changed . The makers didn't exactly go for accuracy did they ? The outcome of the case has also been changed , here in the film there's a terrible ' happy Hollywood ending ' in which Father Moore is freed & just made me want to vomit really . The scares are none existent although I did like the fact the makers kept the use of CGI computer effects down to a minimum , there's nothing in the way of blood or gore either & the majority of the films slow two hour duration is set in the courtroom . With a supposed budget of about $20 , 000 , 000 this was a surprise hit at the box-office , obviously the vast majority of people being sold on the true story & horror aspects of it both of which are awful . I thought the acting was pretty poor & in particular in my opinion Laura Linney was absolutely awful . The Exorcism of Emily Rose is maybe the worst big Hollywood studio film that I have seen in the past few years , hell I'd rather watch Blackwater Valley Exorcism ( 2006 ) again than watch this . Thank God I saw it on telly for free & didn't waste any money on it .
Confusing nonsense .	The Attic Expeditions starts with the revelation that Trevor Blackburn ( Andras Jones ) has murdered his fiancé Faith ( Beth Bates ) . After a medical procedure went awry Trevor has been in a coma for the past four years in a sanatorium for the criminally insane run by the sinister Dr . Ek ( Jeffrey Combs ) . Trevor regains consciousness & claims to remember nothing about Faith's death , Ek decides to try a little experiment out on Trevor & places him in the ' House of Love ' run by Dr . Thalama ( Wendy Robie ) , a sort of normal house environment for the insane to readjust to normal life or something like that . The other patients are the attractive Amy ( Shannon Hart Cleary ) , Liz ( Nancy Wolf ) , Doug ( Seth Green ) & Ronald ( Jerry Hauck ) . At first things seem good but the very first night Trevor has a dream about going into the attic & finding a spooky old chest . The next day Trevor has an interesting & somewhat revealing conversation with Ronald who is murdered shortly after , Trevor has more dreams about Faith , operations & books about Black magic as he becomes more & more paranoid over who he can trust & just what the hell is going on . . . Directed by Jeremy Kasten this is one weird film , personally I really disliked it . The problem I have with The Attic Expeditions is the script by Rogan Russell Marshall which is an absolute incomprehensible mess . Nothing is this film is given any sort of closure , was it all a dream ? A hallucination ? Was it reality ? Was half of it reality & half of it fantasy ? I mean just what the hell was this film all about ? Whats with the staircase hidden in a chest ? Why does someone suddenly turn into a psycho killer ? What with the book with blank pages ? Whats with Dr . Ek ? There are people who will like this sort of muddled plot & try to come up with lots of possibilities & theories which is fine I suppose but I like my films to have closure & come together rather than just end up all over the place . I can't stress enough just how much of a mess the narrative actually is , this film is all over the place & incredibly confusing . It likes to introduce twist & turn after twist & turn which in the end ties itself up in knots . I still don't have much of a clue about what happened & I'm not going to waste anymore of my life trying to figure it out . On a positive note at least it's original & tries to be different . Director Kasten must take a huge slice of the blame , the various plot threads just don't go anywhere & I'm at a loss to understand why he didn't try to tie the dreams , hallucinations & the reality together so it actually makes some kind of sense . What makes thing even worse is that there are some good ideas & I always felt there was a good film trying to break free of the muddled narrative . The gore is tame , a few splashes of blood & a ( dream ? reality ? hallucination ? ) scene of Trevor with the top of his head sliced off & his brain exposed . There is some nice nudity too . With a relatively low budget of $1 , 000 , 000 The Attic Expeditions is a surprisingly well made film with really good cinematography , decent special effects , nice production values & it's well made . The acting is pretty good expect for Andras Jones the lead who was flat & bland . Horror genre favourite Jeffrey Combs deserves better than this . The Attic Expeditions is a mess of a film , I simply can't look at it any other way . I'm sure there are people who will like this & this is my own personal opinion but I really couldn't recommend this film to anyone , very disappointing .
More straight-to-video shot in Bulgaria action film junk from Seagal .	Today You Die starts as honourable criminal Harlan banks ( producer Steven Seagal ) is hired by sinister businessman Max Stevens ( Kevin Tighe ) to drive a security vehicle with $20 , 000 , 000 of cash in the back from point ' A ' a Las Vegas casino to point ' B ' him , sounds simple right ? Well what Max forgot to tell Harlan that the money is stolen & that he has just become the getaway driver in an armed robbery . Bummer . Things get even worse for Harlan when the local cops catch him & chuck him in prison for a long time , however Harlan managed to hide the money before he was caught & with a nice $20 , 000 , 000 at stake & unaccounted for Harlan has to watch his back as the crooks want it as do Government agents . Harlan teams up with Ice Kool ( ! ) ( Anthony ' Teach ' Criss ) in prison & they both manage to escape at which point Harlan goes looking for some revenge . . . Photographed & directed by Don E . FauntLeRoy one has to say that the shot in Eastern Europe straight-to-video action films that Steven Seagal specialises in these days aren't getting any better & Today You Die is a good case in point . This is a terrible film , simple as that really . The script by producer Danny Lerner , Kevin Moore & Les Weldon gives Seagal a new sort of character to get his none existent acting skills around , that of a criminal rather than some Government agent / cop / soldier / one man army cliché he usually plays . In fact if you were being charitable you could say Today You Die is a rip-off of Mel Gibson's excellent thriller Payback ( 1998 ) where he too played a really nasty piece of work to such good effect . While Payback was a superb uncompromising hard edged film noir type action thriller Today You Die isn't & pales into insignificance by comparison . Unfortunately here Seagal is terrible , he has no on screen presence or menace either & the audience is never quite sure whether he is meant to be a bad guy that we hate or not . For instance initially his character's is set up like a modern day Robin Hood as he steals from the rich drug dealers & scumbags to give to the poor ( as well as keeping a tidy profit for himself ) which is just ludicrous in itself but then it has Seagal turn around & murder a lot of people which contradicts the likable criminal with morals that the film went to such lengths to set up in the first place . The story is full of holes , for instance Agent Knowles is contacted by the on the run Harlan & is then reprimanded by her bent superior for meeting him & it turns out that he found out by tapped her phone . In that case why didn't her boss use the information he had to catch Harlan ? The story is the usual dull predictable bland fight over lots of money with surprise surprise the investigating Government agent is actually a bad guy ! Wow , I didn't see that coming I must say . . . Director FauntLeRoy slows everything down to a snails pace & Today You Die feels like it goes on forever , the action scenes & set-pieces are also severely lacking in entertainment value . The infrequent fight scenes aren't great , most are either shot in shadow , very quickly cut & edited or with the camera played behind Seagal's character to try & disguise the fact that most of the stunt work done here is by a double . Again Seagal looks fat & out of shape & uses long baggy overcoats to try & hide it , it doesn't . There's a pretty cool car chase through the streets of Las Vegas in this at the start & I thought that Today You Die might be alright but it seems the whole sequence was stolen from another action film called Top of the World ( 1997 ) which is about a Las Vegas casino robbery , as well as using footage from that film Today You Die also edits scenes from the Charlie Sheen action film No Code of Conduct ( 1998 ) , the Jean-Claude Van Damme action film The Order ( 2001 ) & the Wesley Snipes prison based action film Undisputed ( 2002 ) so quite how much of Today You Die is original footage is anyone's guess . Technically the film is alright , considering it's edited together from four separate films as well as it's own footage it's just about competent & consistent enough . All the footage of the US locations are obviously lifted from the films already mentioned with all the original footage shot on the cheap in Bulgaria . The rap style music that litter Today You Die is awful by the way . The acting is poor & Seagal just mumbles his way through his lines as usual . Today You Die is a really bad film made up from other bad action films , Seagal looks old & fat , the action scenes are average at best & most of the story is fairly random & it doesn't come together at the end that well at all . One to avoid unless your a die hard Seagal fan , if such an animal even exists . . .
I don't get why this is so highly regarded , I really don't .	Night of the Comet starts as the world prepares for a once in a lifetime event , the passing of a 65 million plus year old comet . Instead of watching the light show Regina Belmont ( Catherine Mary Stewart ) decides to spend the night with cinema projectionist Larry Dupree ( Michael Bowen ) in his booth . . . They awake the next morning & as Larry attempts to leave the cinema he is attacked & killed by a zombie , the same zombie attacks Regina but she manages to escape where upon she discovers that almost everyone on the entire planet has been turned into red dust . Almost everyone because by some amazing coincidence the only other person to survive happens to be her sister Samantha ( Kelli Maroney ) , they desperately search for more survivors & meet up with a long distance trucker named Hector Gomez ( Robert Beltran ) . Meanwhile an evil bunch of scientists need human blood to develop a serum to save themselves from turning into dust & they're on the look out for unwilling donors . . . Written & directed by Thom Eberhardt I found Night of the Comet a pretty rubbish viewing experience , I'm surprised at the amount of positive comments on IMDb about it because I just thought it was boring crap that never lived up to it's potential . The script starts off 100 miles an hour with the obliteration of the entire population of Earth & a zombie attack but then it goes absolutely nowhere & then eventually introduces the sinister blood stealing scientists towards the end of the film because by that time the slim story has run it's course . There are plot holes too , if these scientists want blood why shoot the three or four gang members & save the two sisters when the guys would have provided more blood for their experiments , killing them just seemed a totally bizarre & an almost suicidal thing to do considering they need blood to develop a cure , it just doesn't make sense I mean if your going to die & you need to experiment on human blood would rather have five or six donors providing blood or just two ? I'm not having the fact that the two sisters survived independently of each other , I mean what are the odds on that ? When Hector confronts the female scientist for the first time she never mentions Samantha or where she was or where the underground facility was where they took Regina before she committed suicide so how did Hector know these things ? I also thought after the first twenty odd minutes the film slows down to a snails pace & became incredibly boring & dull to watch , after hearing so many good things about it Night of the Comet comes across to me as nothing more than an overrated boring piece of crap . Director Eberhardt does a really good job , I liked the look of the film with it's red tinted sky & he manages to create a really cool atmosphere of isolation . Unfortunately there are far too many shots of empty streets , there are constant montage's of empty streets , deserted roads & abandoned buildings & it gets extremely repetitive & dull . OK we get it there's no one else about so there's no need to keep ramming it down our throats by constantly showing roads without cars on them . The zombies are totally wasted , there are two zombie attacks in the entire film & that's two individual zombies as well although there are a couple of effective nightmare scenes . Night of the Comet pays homage , or rips-off whichever you prefer , several other much better films including the obligatory end of the world shopping spree in a mall lifted from Dawn of the Dead ( 1978 ) . Forget about any blood or gore as there isn't any . Technically Night of the Comet is pretty good , the special effects are decent enough & the production crew were obviously very good at closing streets off . The acting was alright expect for Maroney as Samantha the air-head blonde who became highly irritating . Night of the Comet was a big disappointment for me , I had hoped for so much more . Persoanlly I found this film dull , boring , uneventful & the puke inducing sequence where the sisters go shopping to the tune of ' Girls Just Wanna Have Fun ' is probably the worst moment in the film . Really bad & I just don't get why so many people like this , I'm sure I'll get slaughtered for saying it so let the abuse begin I can take it . . .
" No respectable ghost would live in California . " Really unfunny comedy .	High Spirits is set in Ireland where Peter Plunkett ( Peter O'Toole ) is told he has two weeks left to pay the mortgage on his ancestral Castle turned hotel , unfortunately the hotel isn't very popular & in an attempt to muster business Peter advertises it as an authentic haunted Castle complete with real ghosts . Peter's attempt's at fooling his guests into thinking the Castle is haunted fail miserably , however all is not lost as then the real ghosts take over . Much hilarity ensues , not . . . This English American co-production was written & directed by Neil Jordan & quite frankly I think High Spirits is a pretty bad film . The script is a muddled mess , there are sporadic moments of supposed comedy , there's an awful romance between American tourist Steve Guttenberg & ghost Daryl Hannah , there's stupid drama & it tries to chuck some horror into the mix as well . None of it works , it never comes together as one coherent piece & the fact that it's so unfunny , childish , predictable & rather boring doesn't help my love for it . The character's are clichéd , the ghosts are underused & did I mention that it wasn't funny yet ? So here we have a film that tries to be a horror comedy but fails on both counts , High Spirits is not a film I look back on with any fondness . At all . Director Jordan has apparently gone on record as saying that he had no input over the editing process & what was released was substantially different to his original cut , to be honest that sounds like an excuse for making such a bad film as he still directed the scenes which ended up on screen , it was still his script this mess came from & quite frankly how much difference could there have been ? Was there hours of unused footage ? Would any of it been any funnier if there was ? I imagine the studio probably tweaked it a bit but maybe because Jordan's original cut was even worse , I just don't believe this ' it would have been brilliant if the studio had left it alone ' rubbish . , anyway I guess we'll never find out either way . . . I must admit the film looks quite nice with good sets although the special effects vary between impressive & poor . On a side note did anyone else notice the white horse Guttenberg lands in front of when he falls out of the tree hit by lightening ( don't ask ) ? I'm positive you can see the horse's penis dangling between it's legs , not that I specifically look out for these things you understand . . . Technically High Spirits is fine with decent production values . Looking at the cast list it's pretty impressive although no one covers themselves in glory , O'Toole is good but that's it . Gutteneberg tries to act all emotional , oh dear . . . High Spirits is a comedy that simply isn't funny & it's story is a mess that doesn't entertain , I don't know what else to say other than I didn't like it . Could have been better , much better . Watch Ghostbusters ( 1984 ) instead to see how a proper supernatural comedy should be done .
" Your sunglasses are the only protection you have from all the white out there . " Bad made-for-TV action flick .	Blackjack starts as former FED Jack Devlin ( Dolphh Lundgren ) is called in by his brother to protect his young daughter Casey ( Padraigin Murphy ) with good reason because shortly after an attempt is made on her life , luckily Devlin is pretty much bullet proof & hard as nails so a heavily armed gang of mercenaries is no problem although one throws flash grenade which temporarily blinds Devlin but simply not being able to see isn't enough to stop Devlin killing all the bead guy's & saving his niece . However the attack has left Devlin with a phobia , he is afraid of the colour white which is a bit of a problem . Anyway , when his former FED buddy Tim Hastings ( Fred Williamson ) is shot while protecting a supermodel client named Cinder James ( Kam Heskin ) Devlin takes over the operation & sets about finding out who wants to kill Cinder & stopping them , obviously . . . This made-for-TV American Canadian co-production was surprisingly executive produced & directed by John Woo who deserves better than this & one wonders why he made Blackjack straight after the big budget futuristic action flick Face / Off ( 1997 ) , to me it seemed like a step backwards although having said that his next film after Blackjack was the big budget Tom Cruise flick Mission : Impossible II ( 2000 ) so I can only assume he made this over a couple of weekends to pass the time . Anyway , the script by executive producer Peter Lance is to be blunt tripe . For a start it's unoriginal , it's predictable , it has very low key action scenes & set pieces , bad dialogue , clichéd character's & it's dull . Then there's this nonsense about Devlin being afraid of the colour white , I'm sorry but I was like sitting there thinking so what ? It's hardly the most exciting plot device in the world is it ? The only reason it's original & hasn't been used in any other film is because it's such a stupid notion nobody ever wanted to use it before . The scene when the bad guy gets away because he drops a large white sheet down in front of Devlin is hilarious & stupid in equal measure as is the fight in a huge pool of milk . The bad guy's motives suck , the script takes itself very seriously & there are no one-liners or wisecracks to lighten the tone & there's no chemistry between any of the character's either . Director Woo is on autopilot here , sure there are maybe a couple of decent motorbike stunts but apart from that there's some shoot outs with his traditional slow motion shots there but very little else , it's certainly not exciting & where do I get some of those razor sharp playing cards that Devlin has ? Devlin is hard , in fact he's so hard he even has a butler who wears an eye-patch . . . You have every right to expect better from Woo . With a supposed budget of about $10 , 000 , 000 Blackjack had a much bigger budget than I first thought although Lundgren was paid $2 , 000 , 000 & the film looks like what it is , a low budget made-for-TV action flick , there's no style or substance here at all although it's well made for what it's worth . The cast are alright although Heskin never convinces as a supermodel in either looks or acting department . Fred Williamson is wasted in small cameo . Blackjack feels like something Woo made during his weekends , I don't really understand what anyone would see in it as it's not exciting & it's action scenes are below average .
Really bad sequel .	The Rage : Carrie 2 starts with the Mother ( J . Smith-Cameron ) of a young girl with telekinesis named Rachael ( Kayla Campbell ) being taken away by paramedics to rot in in insane asylum . Jump forward several years later & Rachael ( Emily Bergl ) is now a freaky looking goth wannabe teenage high school student who all the popular kids think is a skank & to add to her worries she only has one friend , Lisa Parker ( Mena Suvari ) . If that wasn't enough one of the football jocks Eric Stark ( Zachery Ty Bryan ) dumps Lisa in a rather unfriendly way , Lisa is devastated & commits suicide by jumping off the school roof . Eric & the other lads seem more concerned about the damage to the car Lisa landed on while Rachael is understandably gutted , as Rachael begins to discover the cruel joke played on Lisa & herself by her fellow students she delivers her own unique violent brand of revenge as she goes into a rage . . . Directed by Katt Shea , who also has a small role in the film as an assistant D . A . , I thought The Rage : Carrie 2 was a pretty awful film . The original Carrie ( 1976 ) is a brilliant horror / thriller & my IMDb comment exists to prove that I think that but this supposed sequel fails in almost every respect in which the original was so good . The script by Rafael Moreu is slow , it has the most clichéd & unlikable character's imaginable , it's wholly predictable , there's no subtlety & there is virtually zero build up or development unlike the original . The dialogue was bad , the character's didn't work & I really fail to see why Lisa & Rachael were treated as outcasts as I thought they were both very attractive & seemed pretty ' normal ' , the whole concept of Rachael as an outsider & social misfit just didn't work as she comes across as far too normal . One of the reasons why the original was such a good & powerful film was of Carrie & the fantastic & utterly believable Oscar nominated performance by Sissy Spacek , can the same be said about Bergl ? She ain't getting anywhere near an Oscar unless she steals one ! Unfortunately the central character & how you feel towards them is essential for the film to work so when it's messed up as badly as it is here the film suffers . For most of it's dull running time The Rage : Carrie 2 plays like a teen drama with the boring romance between Rachael & Jesse ( Jason London ) dominating things , it's not until the bland climax that Rachael uses her powers to any entertaining effect . Director Shea does nothing , her idea of style is to shake the camera a bit , insert a few black & white shots & have a stupid sound effect when Rachael uses her powers , yuk . It has none of the elegant class of the original . The scene at the end when Rachael's tattoo starts to grow & cover her body is meaningless & looks terrible . The climax is basically the same as the original with Rachael using her powers to take revenge on her tormentors , at least there's some blood during this bit . A couple of people are impaled on pokers , someones glasses shatter which make their eyes explode , someone has a spear shot through his groin & in a hilarious bit someone is attacked by a plastic pool cover which knocks him out ! I was simply amazed to learn that The Rage : Carrie 2 had a supposed budget of about $21 , 000 , 000 , where did all the money go ? That seems like an awful lot of money , there's no big name stars , no special effects until the end , no exotic locations , no stunts or action scenes & it's set almost entirely in the same place . It's generally well made but then for that sort of money that's the minimum requirement . The acting was pretty bad with Amy Irving the only returning original cast member . The Rage : Carrie 2 is an awful film that doesn't deserve to feed off the reputation of the original , this is definitely a sanitised bottle-less version of Carrie for the teenage masses . In my opinion apart from a few half decent deaths at the end The Rage : Carrie 2 sucks , it's as simple & straight forward as that .
Another terrible low budget Seagal effort , will he ever make a decent flick again ?	Mercenary for Justice starts as corrupt CIA agent John Dresham ( Luke Goss ) & all round bad guy Anthony Chapel ( Roger Guenveur Smith ) arrange the kidnapping of the French Ambassador in a remote African island using hard as nails Gulf war veteran John Seeger ( co-executive producer & uncredited co-writer Steven Seagal ) & some of his mates as cover , plausible deniability & all that apparently . John isn't happy when he learns the truth & is even less happy when his best mate Radio Jones ( Zaa Nkweta ) is killed during the fighting . Back in the US & John promises to look after Radio's widow Shondra ( Faye Peters ) & young son Eddie ( Tumi Mogoje ) but Chapel is hired by billionaire Greek Arab arms dealer Ahmet Dasan ( Peter Butler ) to break is son out of prison & kidnaps both Shondra & Eddie in order to force Seeger to carry out the break . Seeger isn't happy & his mood doesn't improve & sets out to gain revenge on those who double crossed him & are threatening the lives of his friends family . . . This Arubian , American & South African co-production was directed by Don E . FauntLeRoy who is also credited as cinematographer Mercenary for Justice was the second of three awful straight-to-video / DVD action flicks he made with Seagal ( the other's being Today You Die ( 2005 ) & Urban Justice ( 2007 ) which are just as bad ) & at this stage I seriously doubt whether Seagal will ever make a decent action film again , entertaining action fare such as Hard to Kill ( 1990 ) , Marked for Death ( 1990 ) , Out for Justice ( 1991 ) & the two Under Siege ( 1992 , 1995 ) films seem a distant memory from a very long time ago . One of the main problems with Mercenary for Justice in my opinion is that it's insanely complicated & tries to be too clever , there are all sorts of vague double crosses & ulterior motives & supposed twists & turns that are just so contrived & convoluted that they make little sense & are so badly written & presented end up making the whole film feel like a complete unfocused mess . No-ones motives are ever fully revealed , I still don't really know what that CIA guy played by Luke Goss is all about , why were Seagal & his men fighting at the start , who was Chapel & why did he hire people he couldn't control & the whole thing is just a mess that jumps around from scene to scene trying to be clever but it's so poorly put together it's annoyingly confusing . Even though it only lasts for about an hour & a half it feels much , much longer which is never a good sign , the dialogue is terrible , the character's are not fleshed out & their motives are never made clear & there isn't even much action in it which is the final nail in it's coffin really as far as I am concerned . These days Seagal is fat , you can see it & he's out of shape & not that menacing & he looks sluggish , slow & unconvincing in the action scenes . There are one or two fights which are quite violent but for the most part he leaves the action to other people & is it any coincidence that one of the other main character's is fatter than he is ? I am sure that guy Bulldog is there to make sure Seagal isn't the fattest person on screen during the action ! During the old days Seagal's action scenes were based around brutal martial arts violence & amusing one-liners , these days he can barely walk yet alone pull those moves off . There are a few explosions , a few shoot-outs & some fights but nothing special or that memorable . According to the IMDb this had a budget of about $15 , 000 , 000 which I don't believe for a second , there is no way this cheap looking film cost that much . Apparently shot in Bulgaria & South Africa . The acting sucks , Seagal minus pony tail mumbles his way through the film as usual while Luke Goss has managed to put this turkey behind him having appeared in the recent Hellboy II : The Golden Army ( 2008 ) . Mercenary for Justice is another terrible low budget shot in Eastern Europe action flick with Seagal who really should either lose some weight or call it a day & realise that he can't make these action films anymore . Not good .
" This guy was ugly before he became a Werewolf . " Cheap horror film .	Lycanthrope starts in a top secret Government laboratory somewhere underground in the middle of the Amazon , a lab where a team of scientists were conducting experiments into the depletion of the o-zone layer & the effects that the suns ultra violet rays have on animal & plant life . Unfortunately something has gone very wrong so the top brass in the American Government send in special forces man Bill Parker ( producer Robert Carradine ) & his sidekick Lee Davis ( Michael Winslow ) to escort Dr . Ivan Stein ( Jeffery Alann Chase ) & his wife Sheila ( Rebecca Holden ) to the lab , assess the situation & ' clean up ' any mess there might be , have you lost the will to live yet ? I had by this point . Some army bird named Rosary ( Dalia Garcia ) & military dude Cody ( Bruce Gregory ) also go along . Once there they discover the various mutilated corpses of the scientific team & some fat black guy wearing an American football shirt who thinks he's a Werewolf because he's been exposed to the suns ultra violet rays . . . Written & directed by Bob Cook who also has a small role in the film as a dead body Lycanthrope is a pretty bad film all round . First it's very clichéd & predictable , for instance the scientists in the team want to study the Werewolf guy while the army dudes just want to kill it . At least a couple of the character's are there merely to pad the film out & become victims , I would also imagine that the pseudo psycho analytic explanation for the Werewolf seemed like a good idea at the time but unfortunately it doesn't translate very well to the screen & it just comes off as completely ridiculous . I suppose the filmmakers wanted to mix the Eco-disaster film with plenty of preaching together with low budget horror , as far as I'm concerned it doesn't work . Having said that the films stuffed with loads of unintentionally hilarious & stupid dialogue , it moves along at a reasonable pace , it's fairly short & it's good for a few laughs . Director Cook was obviously working on a really low budget , the special effects are rubbish including a simple shot of the sun in the sky ! Apparently set in the Amazon it is painfully obvious that it was shot in some local woods , every time the Amazon was mentioned I laughed ! There isn't really a traditional Werewolf in Lycanthrope , only a fat guy who thinks he's one so forget about seeing one . There isn't much gore , only a few after-the-fact dead bodies & a severed hand . Technically Lycanthrope is rough & that's being kind , it's poorly made with very low production values . Now on to the single most interesting aspect of Lycanthrope , have you ever wondered what happened to various stars from the 80's & 90's ? You know who I mean , people like Bill Murray , Steve Guttenberg & Rick Moranis . Well have you ever wondered what happened to the black guy from the Police Academy films who used to make all the funny noises ? Wonder no more as I can reveal he is starring in crap like this ! Yes , in case you want to know he does make lots of funny noises in this as well , talk about type casting ! Unfortunately the budget was so low on Lycanthrope that they couldn't afford him the entire shoot so he was killed off with the first 40 odd minutes . Yep , Lycanthrope really is that low budget ! I bet he & Steve Guttenberg could share some great ' crap films I've been in ' stories during the Police Academy cast union party ! Lycanthrope is a pretty crap film , it's badly made , it's stupid & there aren't any proper Werewolves in it . It's good for a few unintentional laughs & ' that guy from Police Academy ' but otherwise there is very little here to recommend .
" If you fck with him I promise he will hardcore fck with you . " Cheap remake in name only .	Earth vs . the Spider is set in New York where nice guy Quentin Gemmer ( Devon Gummersall ) works as a security guard in a science research lab called ' Biochemco ' , he is an avid comic book reader his favourite strip being the ' Arachnid Avenger ' & he has a huge crush on one of his neighbours a student nurse named Stephanie Lewis ( Amelia Heinle ) , I think I would too to be honest . One night while at work some masked men break in & in an ensuing gunfight his partner Nick ( Mario Roccuzzo ) is shot dead , at the same time he is accidentally injected with an experimental serum . . . Quentin starts to change , he starts to think he has superpowers like his comic book hero & after he manages to kill the notorious ' Midtown Murderer ' ( Randall Huber ) & discovers he can shoot spider webs from a hole in his chest he is convinced of it ( as you would ) . But Quentin soon begins to realise that his new found powers come at a high price as he continues to change & mutate beyond all recognition as he soon discovers he has other more unwanted spider characteristics , Detective Inspector Jack Grillo ( Dan Aykroyd ) is in charge of cleaning the mess Quentin leaves behind . . . Directed by Scott Ziehl Earth vs . the Spider was the first of five made for TV films produced by ' Creature Features ' & isn't that impressive . The only connection this film shares with the original Earth vs the Spider ( 1958 ) is it's title . The script by Cary Solomon , Chuck Konzelman , Max Enscoe & Annie de Young can easily be split into to distinct sections . The first half of Earth vs . the Spider is basically a low-rent low-budget Spider-Man ( 2002 ) , although I'm fully aware this was made before the Hollywood blockbuster it's just the two share remarkable similarities like shooting spider webs from bodily parts , superhuman powers , crime fighting after suffering an injustice , having a crush on a good looking bird but not being able to do anything about it because of what's happening to him & trying to keep his powers a secret & , of course , all the comic book references throughout . Then Earth vs . the Spider changes films to plagiarise & has a go at The Fly ( 1986 ) , which was definitely made before this , as Quentin starts to transform & mutate into an insect & developing it's unwanted characteristics , again it bears striking similarities like the tragic relationship between himself & Stephanie which predictably ends in tears , unfortunately director Ziehl isn't a Cronenberg & you just don't care for the character's or what's happening to them , the only thing that really kept me watching Earth vs . the Spider was to see what Quentin would look like as a human spider mutant thing . I can't believe four people worked on the screenplay as it's rather disjointed , somewhat slow & predictable . Director Ziehl doesn't really add much to the film in the way he shoots things , there's no real style or imagination about it & is pretty forgettable overall . The film has a strange feel as some of the props used indicate a 40's or 50's period film like the old fashioned camera & Quentin's ancient looking TV set while the cars , clothes & scientific equipment would lead one to believe it's set in modern times , maybe Ziehl couldn't make his mind up . There isn't really any blood or gore to speak of although the special make-up effects on the spider creature are fairly impressive . Technically Earth vs . the Spider is bland & forgettable as most of these made-for-TV films are , having said that it's still well made with decent production values , music & photography . The acting is OK but nothing spectacular , Heinle is a very nice looking young lady & Aykroyd just looks embarrassed . I will stop short of call Earth vs . the Spider a bad film but at the same time I can't call it a particularly good one either as it steals it's best ideas from other much better films , as I was watching this I got the feeling I'd seen it before . The sort of film that can pass an hour and a half painlessly enough but you will probably have forgotten about it within a week , average at best . In my humble opinion Mermaid Chronicles Part 1 : She Creature ( 2001 ) is by far the best ' Creature Feature ' so track that down instead .
This one didn't quite work for me .	Monsters : The Legacy is set in a Palm Beach house which an author named Dale ( David Brisbin ) has rented out after he has become convinced it used to belong to horror film legend Faulton Pierce one of the most respected actor's ever to grace Hollywood . Dale is trying to write a book about Pierce & how he managed to create such convincing on-screen character's , while rummaging through the basement Dale finds Pierce's old make-up box & soon learns the truth about Pierce's on-screen creations . . . Episode seven from season one of Monsters this originally aired in the US during December 1988 , directed by Jeffrey Wolf this was based on a story by famed horror author Robert Bloch ( as was Mannikins of Horror ( 1989 ) another story from the first season of Monsters ) & against all expectation is maybe the weakest episode of the first season & if it's not the weakest it's certainly right down there . The story itself isn't that great to begin with & is more of a mystery thriller before a horror type ending which is far too rushed to make sense & have any sort of impact , from a personal point of view I just didn't get the ending at all & I didn't think it worked . It starts off with Dale changing into a monsters & then he's back to normal again & then there's this Vampire standing in the middle of the room who pulls a funny face & then the episode ends . The pace is generally slow & the duration is too short to get over what seems fairly exposition heavy with most of it narrated by Dale as there aren't enough other character's to bounce the various ideas & themes off . As usual there are limited sets & a limited number of cast but it's still quite polished & it looks nice enough . There's no gore in this one & apart from a deformed monster at the end not much in the way of horror or scares or atmosphere . The relatively unknown cast do alright but no-one stands out particularly . The Legacy is maybe the worst Monsters episode from it's first season & I didn't rate it at all , there's just not much of a story , not much horror & a mess of a twist ending .
Quincy in moral message mode .	Quincy M . E . : Seldom Silent , Never Heard starts as a teenage boy named Jeffrey Rosental ( David Tress ) is chased out of a movie theatre & in his attempts to get away he falls from a great height on a building site & is killed . L . A . coroner Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) is on the case & comes to the conclusion Jeffrey's death was an accident , however it comes to Quincy's attention that Jeffrey was suffering from turrets syndrome which causes uncontrollable facial tics & involuntary vocabulary outbursts amongst other symptoms . As Quincy digs deeper into the condition he realises the big pharmaceutical companies are not investing any money into a cure because there's no profit in it . . . Episode 14 from season 6 this Quincy story was directed by Jeffrey Hayden & is one of those episodes which concentrates on the moral issues surrounding some sort of tragedy rather than Quincy playing detective so straight away I have a problem with this episode . The script starts off like a mystery but it's quickly solved & then goes into sentimental overdrive , there are at least four passionate speeches by Quincy about bureaucracy & red tape in this one & even the guest cast get the opportunity have their say as well . Hey , I like it when Quincy gets moral & vents his anger at anyone who will take it but I prefer the murder mystery episodes much more than these dull & in this case somewhat depressing & downbeat heart felt tales of morality . I'm sorry but that's the way it is , not the best Quincy story & unusually the ending leaves everything up in the air as opposed to happy ending we normally get . The lab & the regular cast barely feature in this episode as Quincy goes off on his moral crusade to change the law single handedly , I don't know I just don't like these types of stories . The guest cast are OK but nothing more . Seldom Silent , Never Heard is one of those Quincy episodes where an intriguing murder mystery is replaced with a dull morality tale , not one of the show's finest 50 odd minutes .
One of the poorer Hammer House of Horror episodes . . .	Hammer House of Horror : Visitor from the Grave is set in rural England & starts late one night as rich American Penny Van Prutten ( Kathryn Leigh Scott ) is home alone in her isolated cottage in the woods , loud banging on the front door wakes her & a man named Charles Willowbee ( Stanley Lebor ) breaks in . Charles says he wants her boyfriend Harry Wells ( Simon MacCorkindale ) but he isn't there so Charles turns his attention to Penny & tries to rape her but Penny grabs a double barrelled shotgun & shoots him . The next morning & Harry arrives back at the cottage to find blood on the floor , Penny is hysterics & Charles dead body . Harry says he will bury the body & no-one will ever know what happened , unfortunately Penny is haunted by visions of Charles whose ghost seems to want revenge on her . . . Visitor from the Grave was episode 11 from the one & only season of this British horror anthology series of macabre tales produced by Hammer studios for TV , originally airing over here during November 1980 one has to say that Visitor from the Grave is one of the poorer episodes from this generally high quality series . The script was by Anthony Hinds who had written many scripts for Hammer including The Brides of Dracula ( 1960 ) , The Curse of the Werewolf ( 1961 ) , The Evil of Frankenstein ( 1964 ) , Dracula : Prince of Darkness ( 1966 ) , Dracula Has Risen from the Grave ( 1968 ) , Taste the Blood of Dracula ( 1970 ) , The Scars of Dracula ( 1970 ) & Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell ( 1974 ) to name but a few & with this sort of pedigree one would have thought Hinds might have been able to come up with something a little better than this contrived , insanely convoluted & downright silly piece of telly . You can see the twist ending coming quite literally a mile off , it's so obvious & predictable it's almost embarrassing when it happens . The whole thing is one big con but there are many flaws in the plan , for a start what if Penny had called the police after shooting Charles ? That would have buggered their plans up wouldn't it ? The whole fifty odd minutes is full of holes , script problems , improbabilities & just poor plotting which makes Visitor from the Grave a less than satisfying way to spend fifty minutes . Director Peter Sasdy does alright but no-ones heart seems to be in it , the opening scenes of Charles breaking into the cottage are quite effective but some of the set-pieces thereafter are hilariously bad including the climatic séance which has to be seen to be believed . It's a wonder any of the actors involved kept a straight face especially the guy in the bad false beard , turban & dark sunglasses . There's no blood or gore in this one , unfortunately . Visitor from the Grave is one of the poorer Hammer House of Horror episodes with a bad script & a bad central premise , I don't know what else to tell you really other than there are better episodes out there to watch instead of this .
Nothing special .	Ghost Town starts as Kate Barrett ( Catherine Hickland ) drives along an isolated desert road , her car suddenly breaks down & she hears horses hoofs approaching . . . Deputy Sheriff Langley ( Frank Luz ) of Riverton County is called in to investigate Kate's disappearance after her father reports her missing . He finds her broken down car & drives off looking for her , unfortunately his car breaks down too & he has to walk . Langley ends up at at a deserted rundown ghost town , much to his shock Langley soon discovers that it is quite literally a ghost town as it's populated by the ghosts of it's former residents & is run by the evil Devlin ( Jimmie F . Skaggs ) who has kidnapped Kate for reasons never explained & it's up to Langley to rescue her & end the towns curse . . . The one & only directorial effort of Richard Governor this odd film didn't really do much for me & I didn't like it all that much . The script by Duke Sandefur tries to mix the horror & western genres which it doesn't do to any great effect . Have you ever wondered why there aren't more horror western hybrid films out there ? Well , neither have I but if I were to ask myself such a question I would find all the answers in Ghost Town because it's not very good . The two genres just don't mix that well . There are plenty of clichés , on the western side of things there's the innocent townsfolk who are to scared to stand up to a gang of thugs who are terrorising them , the shoot-outs in the main street , saloon bars with swing doors & prostitutes upstairs & horror wise there's plenty of cobwebs , some ghosts , an ancient curse , talking corpses & a few violent kills . I was just very underwhelmed by it , I suppose there's nothing terribly wrong with it other than it's just dull & the two genres don't sit together that well . There are a few holes in the plot too , why did Devlin kidnap Kate ? I know she resembled his previous girlfriend but how did he know that & what was he going to do with her anyway ? We never know why this ghost town is full of ghosts either , I mean what's keeping them there & what caused them to come back as ghosts ? Then there's the bit at the end where Devlin after being shot says he can't be killed only for Langley to kill him a few seconds later , I mean why didn't the bullets work in the first place ? Director Governor does alright , there's a nice horror film atmosphere with some well lit cobweb strewn sets & the standard Hollywood western town is represented here with a central street with wooden buildings lining either side of it . I wouldn't say it's scary because it isn't , there's not much tension either & the film drags in places despite being only just over 80 odd minutes in length . Forget about any gore , there a few bloody gunshot wounds , an after the fact shot of two people with their throats slit & someone is impaled with a metal pole & that's it . I'd have imagined the budget was pretty small here , it's reasonably well made & is competent if nothing else . Credit where credit's due the period costumes & sets are pretty good actually . The acting is alright but no-ones going to win any awards . Ghost Town is a strange film , I'm not really sure who it's meant to appeal to & it certainly didn't appeal to me . Anyone looking for a western will be annoyed with the dumb horror elements while anyone looking for a horror film will be bored by the western elements . It's something a bit different but that doesn't mean it's any good , worth a watch if your desperate but don't bust a gut to see it .
" You give me apple , Herman give you nice soft bat . " A bit of a bore with a misleading title .	The Vampire Bat is set in the small German village of Klineschloss where Gustave Schoen ( Lionel Belmore ) the Burgermeister is holding a meeting with Inspector Karl Brettschneider ( Melvyn Douglas ) from the local constabulary about all the recent murders , six victims have been discovered in as many weeks all drained of blood & bearing the same two puncture wounds on their necks . Brettschneider doesn't have a single clue but the superstitious elders of the village believe the deaths to be the work of a Vampire . Brettschneider isn't convinced but the scared villagers keep telling tales of seeing a large Bat , meanwhile the latest victim Martha Mueller ( Rita Carlyle ) has been found . Brettschneider comes under increasing pressure to solve the murders but can he really believe that a giant Vampire Bat is responsible & if it is how's he going to stop it ? Directed by Frank R . Strayer The Vampire Bat was a cheapie from Majestic Pictures to cash in on the success of it's two stars Atwill & Wray & their success in the previous years Doctor X ( 1932 ) & is more of a murder mystery rather than a horror as the exploitative & enticing title may have lead you to believe & quite frankly it's rather dull . The script by Edward T . Lowe Jr . takes itself rather seriously & sets up the basic story that something is killing local villagers & that something could possibly be a Vampire , then for most of it's duration the film focuses on Brettschneider & his incompetent investigations which are , not to put too fine a point on it , boring . The Vampire Bat also has a bit of an identity crisis as it doesn't quite know what it wants to be , the title would suggest a horror film while the majority of it could easily be described as a thriller with the final few minutes descending into silly sci-fi . There is no Vampire Bat , the attempts to fool you are pathetic , all the character's are broad stereotypes & you can tell the villain of the piece straight away & as a whole there is nothing particularly exciting or entertaining about The Vampire Bat . I know it's old but that's not an excuse as cinema has moved on a lot since 1933 & a bland , flat , dull , boring & misleading film such as The Vampire Bat just doesn't cut it these days , just look at the original King Kong ( 1933 ) released the same year & how brilliantly that still holds up today . I didn't like it & I doubt many modern film-goers would either , it's as simple & straight forward as that . Director Strayer doesn't do anything special but this is a case in point where I can cut the film some slack because of it's age , as a whole it's pretty much point , shoot & hope for the best stuff . There isn't much in the way of atmosphere or scares although some of the sets which were already existing ones taken from The Old Dark House ( 1932 ) & Universal's European set on their back-lot are nice & add a certain ambiance to things . Technically The Vampire Bat can't compare to anything even remotely modern , for the age of it it's alright I suppose but again I draw your attention back to the original King Kong . Speaking of King Kong it's star Fay Wray has a role in this as does horror icon Lionel Atwill , I'll be kind & say the acting is OK . The Vampire Bat will I imagine fool a lot of people into thinking that it's a horror film about Vampire Bats when in fact it isn't , personally I thought the whole thing was a bit of a bore . It's short & it tells it's story reasonably enough but I must admit I'm not a fan .
" Always bet on black . " Average 90's action flick .	Passenger 57 starts as hotshot ex anti-terrorist Airline security guard John Cutter ( Wesely Snipes ) takes a job as head of security for Atlantic International airlines , he decides to fly out to Los Angeles to start his new job . Unfortunately at the same time the FBI decide to fly air-plane hijacker & terrorist Charles Rane ( Bruce Payne ) , whose exploits have become known as ' the reign of terror ' ( get it ? ) , to LA to stand trial which just plain sounds like a dumb idea & as it turns out it was because Charles with the help of sexy babe Sabrina ( Elizabeth Hurley ) & some of his terrorist mates hijack the plane , kill the FBI dudes & take the passengers hostage . However Cutter manages to throw a spanner in the works & escape down below to jettison the fuel which forces Rane to land the plane , Rane seems prepared & has a back up plan but Cutter is determined to bring him down for good & save the hostages including a stewardess he fancies . . . Directed by Kevin Hooks this typically over-the-top 90's action flick is OK but lacks a certain spark needed to elevate it anything above an average time waster . The script by David Loughery & Dan Gordon takes itself pretty seriously & probably wouldn't get made these days , in fact I'm absolutely positive it wouldn't as it deals with terrorists hijacking an American flight & , well , that's just a sensitive issue these days isn't it ? The script seems rather silly & far fetched these days especially post as the terrorists depicted in Passenger 57 are seemingly able to freely carry guns aboard , impersonate stewardesses & flight attendants as well as take complete control of a commercial airliner very easily . Basically this film has zero credibility & no-one watching it will think it's possible , I'd also say Passenger 57 is one of the top 10 films most likely never to appear as in-flight entertainment . The actual amount of time on the plane in the air is actually quite small as Cutter forces them to land , however it's at this point the film gets really stupid as Rane sneaks off the plane & legs it only for Cutter to magically know where he's going & chase after him . Seriously , if you watch Passenger 57 try to work out how Cutter knows that Rane is headed towards the funfair ? He can't know , it's impossible so why does Cutter follow Rane there when as I've said he couldn't possibly know where Rane was headed ? The character's are poor , Rane as a villain is never given any motivation for what he does , other to escape obviously but none as to why he is a terrorist is what I meant . The film moves along at a nice pace , it only lasts for about 80 minutes & is never boring , there's enough action to keep one amused & the story is OK if a little weak in places . Director Hooks does OK , it's a largely forgettable film to be honest . There's a few decent martial arts fights , some shoot-outs & some chases but it never really gets the blood pumping if you know what I mean , it's competent & fairly slick looking but a bit bland & forgettable overall . I'm not sure if this film is trying to be racist but the two main villains are English , I thought that was a bit harsh actually while most of the good guy's are black . One more thing , I don't know if I have a point here but the interior of the plane looks so fake because the isles between the seats are absolutely massive ! I usually travel economy so maybe that's why but I've never seen isles that wide on a plane before , never . Technically the film is alright , it's well made with that big budget Hollywood action film feel about it . Apparently shot in Florida . The acting is OK , Snipes is alright although the script could have used a few more one-liners to lighten his character up a bit , Payne is a decent villain while Hurley ( I was just reading her IMDb bio where it says she claims she hasn't watched TV since 1979 ! ! ! ! ! ! ) looks hot in this & is probably the only time she has played a villain . Passenger 57 is a decent enough 90's action flick , it's nothing overly special & there are better films out there with similar plots , Executive Decision ( 1996 ) anyone ? This is passable entertainment , although it's probably only worth a rent rather than a buy .
Could have been so much better .	Werewolf : Blood Ties sees Eric ( John J . York ) working as a grounds keeper in a large estate owned by a kindly old lady named Evelyn ( Peg Stewart ) , also living there is her bitter granddaughter Lila ( Catherine Hickland ) & her selfish husband Ray ( James Horan ) . One night Evelyn is brutally murdered in her own home & both Lila & Ray put the blame squarely on Eric who is already wanted for the murder of his roommate back in Los Angeles , however Eric knows he didn't do it & knows who did . The only problem is proving it . . . Episode eighteen from the first & only season of Werewolf this originally aired in the US during November 1987 , directed by David Hemmings I must confess I was rather disappointed by this Werewolf attempt at a whodunit . At only twenty fives in length there's just not enough time to tell a really good murder mystery , the murder of Evelyn doesn't happen till the fifteen minute mark & then there's less than ten minutes left so it's solved pretty quickly . Then there's the fact there are only two suspects , it's an either or guess & you have a straight chance of getting it right . There are no red herrings , no diversions , no clever plotting & as a whodunit it's actually very poor . The other big problem is motive , the eventual killer is never given one apart from the fact they don't like Evelyn that much which is just weak . Surely Blood Ties would have been better & a lot more satisfying if there was actually some dark motive behind the murder ? Hell , any kind of motive would have been nice ! There's a little Werewolf action in Blood Ties but not much , the Werewolf turns up at the end & pushes the killer into a pond & that's your lot . It's interesting to note that Eric has had a wide variety of jobs on his travels , from railroad worker to store clerk to grounds keeper here in Blood Ties . The episode is well made with good production values as usual , neither Skorzeny or bounty hunter Rogan appear in this episode . Blood Ties could have been a great whodunit episode in the horror themed style of Werewolf , as it is it's rather lame & quite frankly one of the worst murder mysteries your ever likely to see .
" Now I'm not going to lie , this is going to hurt . " Average at best as far as I'm concerned .	Copycat is set in San Francisco where a serial killer is at large , homicide inspector's M . J . Monahan ( Holly Hunter ) & her partner Reuben Geotz ( Dermot Mulroney ) are on the case but are going nowhere fast . A serial killer profiler named Helen Hudson ( Sigourney Weaver ) who suffers from agoraphobia & has been housebound for thirteen months after a serial killer named Daryll Lee Cullum ( Harry Connick Jr . ) tried to kill her agrees to help the police catch the killer using her expertise . Helen quickly realises that the killer is copying other serial killers from the past in the way he kills his victims , the killer also contacts Helen & taunts her as he intends to finish the job Daryll Lee Cullum started & kill her in the way Callum wanted . . . Directed by Jon Amiel I am actually amazed at how many positive comments this strictly average killer thriller has , for me it's a poor mans Se7en ( 1995 ) or even The Silence of the Lambs ( 1991 ) . The script by Ann Bidderman & David Madsen takes itself very seriously , is far too long , deviates from the main action too often & doesn't make the most of it's good aspects . There are some good ideas in Copycat including the idea of a serial killer copying other serial killers & the profiler suffering from agoraphobia but little is made of them & I thought Copycat was a throughly routine & disappointingly predictable thriller . For start the killer is identified too early , there's no mystery surrounding who they are at all & he isn't given any sort of motive other than ' I'm a killer & that's what I do ' which is about all the motive a character like Jason Voorhees from the Friday the 13th slasher flicks is given which I didn't like at all & then there's the extremely predictable & clichéd ending where you just know Helen will have to find strength within herself & overcome her agoraphobia in order to defeat the killer , you can just see it coming from the moment we learn she's a agoraphobic . I wasn't keen on the killers characterisation either , why at the end does he save Helen from hanging ? Wasn't that his plan ? To recreate & finish Daryll Lee's plan ? Why save her & then instantly want to killer her again ? He runs after her with a knife so why not let her hang ? Surely that's what he wanted ? For someone who is portrayed as so intelligent & cunning he suddenly becomes a nervous wreck & if you think about it Helen owes the killer for saving her life as much as she owes Monahan . Also why did the killer kill his wife ? What serial killer was he copying then eh ? Director Amiel turns in a throughly standard looking cop thriller , it has absolutely no style like Se7en did , it's not scary , most of the kills are off screen & there's no atmosphere which Se7en manage to generate so well . The gore & violence isn't that excessive , there's a couple of slit throats otherwise all the kills are off screen . The computer terminology used in Copycat is also severely questionable & basically total nonsense . What on earth was that terrible ending all about as well ? It's awful & seemed more suited to a cheap horror flick that wanted to spawn a sequel . As a big fan of the telly series Quincy M . E . ( 1976 - 1983 ) I wonder if they named Hunter's character Monahan after a similar homicide detective in Quincy ? I doubt it but you never know as it's not a common name . With a supposed budget of about $20 , 000 , 000 Copycat is well made but throughly bland & forgettable . There's no style here at all , shot on location in San Francisco & Los Angeles . I thought Sigourney Weaver was pretty good in this but I also thought Holly Hunter was awful , really , really bad . Copycat is an average killer thriller , it doesn't have the scares , the atmosphere or the mysterious intrigue the likes of Se7en & The Silence of the Lambs excel at & which are both far superior to this . A thriller that's not very thrilling , generally disappointing & I thought it was average at best .
" I'm not waiting to be eaten . " Disappointing Japanese zombie film , average at best .	Junk : Shiryo-Gari starts in an American Army laboratory where evil scientist Doctor Kinderman fills a syringe up with a bright green fluid known as DNX which he injects into a corpse of a young Japanese woman named Kyoko ( Miwa Yanagizawa ) who then comes back to life & bites a large chunk out of Kinderman's neck . Three men , Akira ( Shu Ehara ) , Jun ( Nobuyuki Asano ) & Kabu enter a jewellery store & rob it but Akira is stabbed in the foot . They flee the store & to their getaway van driven by a woman named Saki ( Kaori Shimamura ) who speeds off , Jun contacts his Yakuza contact Ramon ( Tate Gouta ) who arrange to meet in an abandoned factory on the outskirts of the city . Meanwhile Doctor Takashi Nikada has been summoned to U . S . Army base to see Colonel McGriff who asks him to help cover up Doctor Kinderman's experiments which he help start & the Military have been carrying on . Back at the factory Jun , Akira , Kabu , Saki , Ramon & his bodyguards quickly discover that they are not as alone as they first thought when they are attacked by rotting flesh-eating zombies . They are forced to fight the zombies as they try to escape with their lives & the 100 , 000 , 000 Yen worth of stolen jewellery . . . This Japanese horror film was co-written & directed by Atsushi Muroga & I was somewhat disappointed by it . The script by Muroga , J . B . Baker , Yoko Kuzuki & Emiko Terao doesn't make the most of it's promising sounding premise that tries to mix horror & action . It's quite slow to get going & the zombies are some of the worst in film history . They look poor with unconvincing make-up & they move so slowly there is simply no threat there whatsoever , I won't even call it walking because they they more shuffle & I was frustrated that the clichéd ' just have your actor stand there & scream until the zombies catch up ' trick is constantly used , why don't they just RUN away ? I was screaming at the screen for these idiots to just outrun these pathetic zombies . The characters are threadbare & unlikable the babe of a zombie in leather apart , the plot is full of holes that you could drive a double-decker bus through & any decent ideas Junk : Shiryo-Gari does have it rips off from better zombie films like the American Military involvement from The Return of the Living Dead ( 1985 ) , the ultra slow zombies from Zombi 2 ( 1979 ) & an almost identical scene when a woman is holding a door shut with a piece of furniture & a zombies fingers poke round the door & Night of the Living Dead ( 1968 ) style intestine eating & only a bullet to the head will kill them & the bright green re-animation serum stolen from Re-Animator ( 1985 ) . Junk : Shiryo-Gari feels like an American film using Japanese locations & actors & there is nothing original here . Technically the film is very basic with flat extremely grainy cinematography , mixed special effects , bland production design being set almost completely in an old factory & lacklustre unexciting direction . Director Muroga fails to film any of the films set pieces with flare , pace or originality . The gore was disappointing , a splinter of wood ( Zombi 2 rip off again ? ) is forced through someones throat , there are a couple of intestine eating scenes , a few gory gunshot wounds , a decapitated head & ripped off hand & someone cut in half . The make up effects aren't particularly impressive & the zombies look really poor except that is Kyoko who for some reason looks perfectly human , can talk & can change the colour of her hair in the blink of an eye ! She also has a nice sexy line in leather outfits & thigh high boots & is probably worth a couple of stars on her own & is quite possibly the sexiest zombie in horror film history . The acting isn't great as far as I can tell but it's all in Japanese so who can tell ? There's a bit of a buzz about Asian horror at the moment with Ringu ( 1998 ) , Ju-On : The Grudge ( 2003 ) & Dark Water ( 2002 ) all getting big budget Hollywood remakes but that doesn't automatically mean all Asian horror is good & Junk : Shiryo-Gari isn't , good that is . Do yourself a favour & avoid this , there are much better horror films , much better zombie films & much better Asian films worthy of your attention . The best thing I can say about it is that it provides a reasonable amount of entertainment once it gets going but ultimately it didn't impress me that much .
I'm in two minds over this one . . .	Laserblast starts in a Californian desert where two lizard like aliens chase another human like alien ( special effects make-up man Steve Neil who also gets a ' special property designer ' credit whatever that means ) & after a short ( one shot each ) laser fight the lizard aliens zap & vapourise the human like alien , the two lizard aliens are disturbed by an air-plane overhead & make their escape in a spaceship but leave behind the human like aliens laser-gun & pendant . In a nearby town teenager Billy Duncan ( Kim Milford ) has a tough life , his mum leaves him home alone a lot , he is picked by by just about everyone who knows him & his girlfriends Father ( Keenan Wynn ) is giving him serious hassle . Billy has had it & to make his day even worse he picks up a speeding ticket , however while on his own messing around in the desert he discovers the human like aliens laser-gun & pendant & discovers that the laser-gun shoots , erm well lasers . Billy starts to change as the power of the laser-gun & pendant take over , it turns Billy into a green faced creature with bad teeth & the strange desire to blow as many cars up as possible . Can shadowy Government official Tony Craig ( Gianni Russo ) together with Billy's girlfriend Kathy ( Cheryl Smith ) put an end to his homicidal laser-blasting ways & get the real Billy back ? Directed by Michael Rae I am somewhat surprised to see Laserblast on the IMDb's bottom 100 list , I mean it ain't no masterpiece that's for sure but one of the 100 worst films ever made ? I don't think so , I really don't . Then again if all you're used to is Hollywood films with budgets that consist of 10's of millions of $'s then yeah I suppose I could see how someone like that might see Laserblast as a pretty crap film . Anyway here's my opinion , I'm in two minds over Laserblast as it's a pretty bad film but there was just about enough in it for me to enjoy it on a basic level . The script by Frank Ray Perilli & Franne Schacht moves along at a reasonable pace , I certainly didn't think it was boring or dull so that's something positive I can say about it . Unfortunately there's plenty of negatives as well , it takes itself far too seriously , the narrative is poor throughout & character's are very underdeveloped & stereotypical including two dumb comic relief Deputies . How did that Government agent guy know what was going on ? The old army buddies thing with him & Kathy's Father goes nowhere & serves no purpose whatsoever . What were the human alien & lizard aliens fighting over in the first place ? Why did the lizard aliens leave the laser-gun behind ? What actually happens to Billy ? Why does he change ? What is he changing into ? You will not find the answer to these & many more questions in Laserblast . Laserblast was released shortly after the much better Star Wars ( 1977 ) to try & cash in on it's success & at one point Billy uses his laser to blow a Star Wars advertisement billboard to pieces ! Make of that reference what you will . The film is basically all about underdog empowerment & in this sense owes as much to the also then recent & also much better Carrie ( 1976 ) . Director Rae doesn't do anything special & he seems to have some sort of fascination with blowing cars up & showing the same shot from different angles . The film has flat & bland cinematography & the dull , repetitive desert locations are instantly forgettable . The films distinctly underwhelming climax has Billy blow up a newspaper stand & letterbox along with , yes you've guessed it , a couple of police cars . The lizard aliens are realised using stop-motion animation & are pretty cute if I'm honest , I want one as a pet although it goes without saying I'd have to take his laser-gun off him otherwise he'd probably zap me . The other special effects are poor & won't impress anyone . Technically Laserblast is pretty rough & not that well made , I counted at least two shots where the boom mike was clearly visible at the top of the screen & generally speaking you can tell it was a low budget effort . The acting was average , no one's going to win any awards for it that's for sure . Laserblast is a terrible film really but there was a certain something that I liked about it , something that kept me watching right through to the bitter end . It has many problems , a badly underdeveloped script , clichéd character's , awful special effects & low production values but I found a certain charm , a certain amount of entertainment value & at the very least I wasn't bored . Sure it's a mess but it's a watchable mess as far as I'm concerned .
" Necrophillia is a very expensive vice professor . " Average giallo .	Una Libelula Para Cada Muerto , or A Dragonfly for Each Corpse as it's more commonly known amongst English speaking audiences , is set in Milan where some drug addict low life named Franco Perotti buys his latest fix & heads home to inject but once there he is brutally murdered by a hatchet wielding psycho . . . Italy's finest Inspector Paolo Scaporella ( Jacinto Molina under his usual Paul Naschy pseudonym ) is on the case with the only clue being a small Dragonfly left on the body , Franco was the second to fall victim to the ' Dragonfly Killer ' & as the bodies continue to pile up the pressure on Scaporella increases . It seems someone is waging a one person war on the drug users , dealers , prostitutes & the general scum of Milan . Scaporella has little to go on apart from the Dragonfly's & a drawing by one of the victims , a drawing of something that Scaporella can't quite make out but his wife Silvana ( Erika Blnac ) thinks she can which makes her the Dragonfly killer's next target . . . This Spanish production was directed by Leon Klimovsky & I personally thought it was nothing more than a below average murder mystery that tries to spice it's undercooked story up with some nudity & fairly gory ( for the time ) murders . The script by star Jacinto Molina ( under that name ) is your basic who dun-nit & not one that particularly impressed me , it starts off well enough with a couple of decent kills but then all sorts of unlikely things happen to stretch the story out & I found the climactic unmasking of the killer very underwhelming . The film states early on that the killer is trying to ' clean up ' Milan & in the final reckoning that's all it amounts too , so in that respect we know the killers motives from pretty much the first five minutes & after that it's just a case of them being found out which in the end Scaporella's wife does ! Why didn't they just put her on the case in the first place ? Also there's the usual stupid unrealistic character actions , for instance if you knew the identity of a sadistic killer who had brutally murdered at least five people would you try to black mail them & even worse meet up with them in the middle of the night in a completely deserted & isolated location ? I mean that's just asking for trouble , isn't it ? I don't get the roller-coaster escape bit either , if your trying to escape from the police why get on a roller-coaster ? I mean a roller-coaster just travels around the same track & will always end up back where it started , right ? There really is very little chance of escaping anywhere on a fairground roller-coaster . The film moves along at a reasonable pace , it has a fair few murder scenes although they're not that graphic & it's watchable but it's just not very clever , the killer's motives & identity are both disappointing & could have used more thought . Director Klimovsky does OK , the film has that 70's sleazy horror atmosphere to it , there's a fair bit of nudity but it lacks gore or violence . Oh , isn't that title A Dragonfly for Each Corpse just great ? The title is one of the main reasons I bothered with it & as many of you already know you can't judge a film by it's title . The fashions & facial hair are all very 70's & the film has a certain dated feel to it which I liked . Technically the film is alright , it's well made enough with decent production values . The film was shot in Spanish & I can honestly say the dubbing & voice acting is absolutely terrible which gives the film an unintentional & unwanted comedic element . Naschy sports a fine moustache in this one , he's all man . . . Una Libelula Para Cada Muerto is a by-the-numbers murder mystery that can't quite decide whether it wants to be a full on gory slasher or a thoughtful who dun-nit , it's somewhere between the two without totally satisfying in either department . Watch something like Tenebre ( 1982 ) , The New York Ripper ( 1982 ) or Opera ( 1987 ) instead .
Decent enough episode .	Monsters : The Mother Instinct starts as lying , cheating , thieving & womanising Nelson ( Tom Gilroy ) persuades his wife Sheila ( Finn Carter ) to ask her well off mother ( Elizabeth Franz ) for money to help cover his debts , however she refuses & a fight ensues in which it comes to light that she has developed a special muscle energising serum from the enzymes of Melon's that gives whoever takes it super human strength for a short time . Sensing an opportunity to print money Nelson uses his gullible wife Shelia to find out the secret of the serum , when it's finally revealed Nelson wants it all for himself & Sheila finally sees him for what he really is but there is one last secret that Nelson hadn't bargained for . . . Episode fifteen from season one of Monster this originally aired in the US during February 1989 , directed by Bette Gordon this is an alright episode of Monsters but nothing special . The Disney styled plot about a magic serum that gives an old lady super human strength & her pantomime villain son-in-law who wants it all for himself would probably be more suited as an episode of Tales from the Darkside ( 1984-1988 ) except that it has a huge slimy monster worm at the end which just about pushes it into horror territory & saves what otherwise would have been a fairly dull twenty odd minutes . The plot is a little silly , the twist's aren't great & at only twenty odd minutes in length not that much happens but I still found it watchable enough & a great big slimy monster worm turning up always helps . There's also a slight moral message here about protecting ones offspring , it's both mirrored in Sheila's mother & indeed the giant worm who both only seem to have their babies best interests at heart in a roundabout kind of way & that's obviously where the title The Mother Instinct comes from too . As usual for Monsters there's a monster here & it's a huge giant worm with a big mouth & lots of sharp teeth as well as lots of little slimy worms with big mouths & sharp teeth . The effects are alright but it's shown very briefly & in a cloud of smoke for some reason . There's nothing in the way of gore here in this one & not even much horror to be honest . Monsters : The Mother Instinct is another watchable episode that isn't amongst the show's best but still passes twenty odd minutes harmlessly enough & anyone into their horror anthology telly show's should like it .
OK tale from the crypt .	Tales from the Crypt : The Trap starts as Lou Paloma ( Bruce McGill ) loses yet another job , his worried wife Irene ( Teri Garr ) reminds him of how much debt they are in & that they have big money problems . Lou becomes desperate & comes up with a plan to defraud his insurance company & cash in on his life policy , blackmailing his mortician brother Billy ( Bruno Kirby ) into helping him they come up with a story that a burglar killed Lou , local mortician Billy would step in & officially pronounce him dead , Irene would receive the insurance money & they would fly off to Rio & live a life of luxury . Could it really be that simple ? This Tales from the Crypt story was episode 1 from season 3 , directed by Michael J . Fox who also has a small role in The Trap I thought this was a disappointing opener to season 3 . The script by Scott Alexander was based on a story from the ' Shock SuspenStories ' comic book & is more of a crime thriller than horror which isn't the type story I want to see while watching Tale from the Crypt , generally speaking The Trap is a pretty straight forward crime thriller with the usual Tales from the Crypt twist at the end which really isn't that surprising & if you think about it has plenty of plot holes & just doesn't work . Directed by Michael J . Fox himself I'm sure he didn't appreciate the story he was given as there's no horror , no suspense or gore in this episode , I mean what the hell was the point ? The acting is OK & there's a few decent over-the-top performances here especially McGill . The Trap is average Tales from the Crypt & one for the fans only really as there are far better stories out there , hopefully this isn't representative of the rest of season 3 .
Decent enough Monsters episode .	Monsters : The Vampire Hunter starts as renowned Victorian Vampire hunter & killer Ernest Chariot ( Robert Lansing ) informs his younger protégé Jack Avery ( Jack Koenig ) that he intends to retire from the Vampire hunting business . Then Chariot is visited by a young woman named Maura Warren ( Page Hannah ) who begs for his help as she suspects her brother has been turned into a Vampire , Chariot seems uninterested & sends her away but Jack is taken with her & when she speaks to him alone that night he agrees to help her . However Maura is not what she seems & Jack has unwittingly become a pawn in a larger game of revenge . . . Episode three from season one of Monsters this originally aired in the US during November 1988 , directed by Michael Gornick this is a reasonable way to pass twenty odd minutes but it's rather forgettable & there's no twist at the end which I always think are essential for these short horror anthology programmes to work . To be fair the plot isn't too bad although it does feel like a standard Hammer horror Vampire film condensed into twenty minutes , there's the Peter Cushing style Vampire hunter , there's the Christopher Lee style Vampire bad guy & the Victorian setting . The one big disappointment here with The Vampire Hunter is a lack of any real twist's or surprises , it's just too straight forward & a little bit predictable . Still , it moves along at a decent pace , it's short , the character's all serve their purpose well enough & it manages to tell a reasonable story within it's limited duration although like a lot of Monsters episodes it finishes abruptly just as your getting into it . Like most Monsters episodes The Vampire Hunter takes place on only two or three sets & features a small cast but the Victorian period sets are well realised & look quite nice while the costumes & props help the overall look & feel of the episode . There's a bit of gore when a Vampire has a stake driven through his chest at the end & there's a disfigured Vampire with burn scars across his face which are revealed when he removes his Hannibal Lector style face mask . The acting is good , TV & film veteran Robert Lansing plays the stately Vampire hunter while the main Vampire appears to have been dubbed for most of his screen time . The Vampire Hunter doesn't feel like a Monsters episode as such because of the lack of twist's , it feels more like a cut down period Hammer horror film which is no bad thing in itself but personally I would rather watch the real thing . Fans of the show should like it but it's not the best example .
" I bet this didn't happen in your filthy novels . " Good premise but ultimately wasted .	Matango , or under one of it's alternate titles Attack of the Mushroom People , Curse of the Mushroom People , Fungus of Terror , Matango the Fungus of Terror or Matango : Fungus of Terror as I saw it under , starts off the shores of Japan where five friends including businessman Fumio Kasai ( Yoshio Tsuchiya ) , an author named Etsuro Yoshida ( Hiroshi Tachikawa ) , radio & TV presenter Mami Sekiguchi ( Kumi Mizuno ) , University professor Kenji Murai ( Akira Kubo ) & his student Akiko Soma ( Miki Yashiro ) have hired a yacht owned & run by captain Naoyuki Sakeda ( Hiroshi Koizumi ) & a sailor named Senzo Koyama ( Kenji Sahara ) . They are caught in a vicious thunderstorm , the yacht is damaged & they become lost . They are very lucky that they drift towards an island & potential safety , once ashore they discover another wrecked ship that they use as a base . It appears to be some sort of scientific research ship on a mission to study the effects of nuclear testing & radiation . They also find books which warn not to eat the mushrooms which grow in abundance on the mysterious island but with food running very low , seven mouths to feed & tension growing several of the group cannot resist the temptation . Unfortunately for them the mushrooms have strange side effects , strange mutating side effects & the survivors quickly realise that they have to fight the mushroom men as well as hunger . . . This Japanese production was directed by veteran Ishiro Honda , Matango had a great premise & could have made for a good horror / monster film but when the finished product is viewed it has to go down as a big disappointment . The script by Takeshi Kimura & an uncredited Sakyo Komatsu takes itself 100 % seriously & is based on the on story ' The Vioce in the Night ' by William Hope Hodgson which I have not read so I cannot compare them . The film starts out promisingly enough with the group being stranded on the island & the scene being set but then it goes absolutely nowhere as the following 40 odd minutes is constant moaning & arguing amongst the group trying to decide what to do & petty squabbling as everyone tries to get the upper-hand . OK , listen I'm all for character development & a strong story but I really started to dislike these selfish annoying & irritating people which in turn made Matango hard to watch & like . I just wanted to see the mushroom people attack , unfortunately that doesn't happen until the last 10 minutes or so , until that point the mushroom people only make two brief appearances & are almost inconsequential to the dull melodramatics . I just found it a bit tedious & boring , I actually started to check my watch to see how long was left even though the film only lasts for a relatively short 70 minutes . Director Honda does a good job & he manages to create a great atmosphere especially the deserted ship with it's rundown equipment & fungus covered walls , it's a pretty creepy place . The mushroom people themselves aren't shown in any great detail & don't feature that much but they're pretty freaky looking & very effective when they make an appearance , I just wish they were in the film more . Technically Matango is very good , it's competent & generally well made throughout . The version I saw was a panned & scanned English dubbed travesty , huge chunks were obviously cut off each side of the frame & the dubbing was absolutely terrible . I'm not sure an original ratio Japanese language version would greatly improve it but it certainly couldn't be any worse . It's hard to tell whether the acting was good or not since the English dub was hardly the fault of the original Japanese cast , was it ? Matango was a huge disappointment for me , it's not a bad watch I suppose & at least it's short but when ' The End ' credit card appeared I couldn't help but feel short changed . Could have been great , as it is it's strictly average at best .
Another average Midsomer Murders episode .	Midsomer Murders : Death in a Chocolate Box is set in the small village of Midsomer Holm where retired Segeant Jack Colby ( Pip Donaghy ) lives & works as a probation officer with his wife the criminal psychoanalyst Gina ( Clare Higgins ) both helping ex-criminals readjust into society . Things take a sinister turn when recently paroled criminal Eddie Marston ( Nigel Harrison ) becomes their latest case , the body of Jack Colby is found having been bludgeoned to death & DCI Tom Barnaby ( John Nettles ) & Sgt . Ben Jones ( Jason Hughes ) are on the case . Tom & Jack used to be good friends , they joined the force together but Jack had to retire amidst a sex scandal involving the murdered Maria Godbold the wife of Lord Holm ( Edward Petherbridge ) who was convicted of her murder shortly after but they haven't spoken in over sixteen years . Barnaby feels he must reopen the Godbold murder case to get to the truth & bring a killer to justice . . . Episode 8 from season 10 this Midsomer Murders mystery was directed by Richard Holthouse & one has to say Death in a Chocolate Box pretty much ends the tenth season on a distinctly average & lacklustre note , more or less in keeping with the whole season really . The script by Tony Etchells is utterly unremarkable & one of those really slow going ones that takes literally ages to start , it's over half an hour before the first murder happens & then a further ten minutes before the body is found & Barnaby is called in . For the first thirty minutes there's a lot of unnecessary exposition , character build up & scene setting that really doesn't go anywhere & feels like padding . The actual plot is alright I suppose , it involves blackmail gone wrong , a past vendetta , a scandal & plenty of lies & cover ups . Par for the course really . The problem is that you can't really do anything different with the show , I mean Midsomer Murders is Midsomer Murders because people are murdered in Midsomer for the usual reasons such as jealously , money , greed & self preservation . There's just not a whole lot you can do with that basic requirement so a lot of the latter episodes feel like rehashes , predictable & the wonderful writing , eccentric character's & intricate plots full of clever red herrings just aren't there anymore like in the earlier seasons either . At almost two hours in length Death in a Chocolate Box is yet again a very exposition heavy episode with only two murders so you need to pay attention . The end of this episode sees Barnaby's daughter Cully reveal that she is about to get married to her boyfriend which leads directly into the season eleven episode Blood Wedding ( 2008 ) . As usual the production values are flawless , beautifully shot in the English countryside this looks great . There are only two murders in Death in a Chocolate Box neither are graphic although you do see a pool of blood on the floor & a dead body on an autopsy table . The acting is top notch as usual too , Clare Higgins makes her second Midsomer Murders appearance after Midsomer Rhapsody ( 2005 ) from season eight & the only real reason I know that is because she starred in the first two Hellraiser films which are amongst my favourite films ever . The other main cast member of note is Chris Barrie who is better known for his comedy roles including Rimmer in the popular sci-fi sitcom Red Dwarf ( 1988 - 1999 ) & The Brittas Empire ( 1991 - 1997 ) . Death in a Chocolate Box is an average Midsomer Murders episode to finish what I truly believe to be a pretty average tenth season , I can't really think of one outstanding episode from the season at all if I'm honest .
One of Troma's better films .	Sgt . Kabukiman N . Y . P . D . starts as New York police detective Harry Griswold ( Rick Gianasi ) decides to go to a Japanese theatre but has his night ruined when a bunch of machine gun wielding thugs burst in & begin shooting up the place , the owner of the theatre manages to breathe his dying Kabukiman spirit into Harry who over the next few days experiences some strange transformations . He suddenly becomes Kabukiman a Japanese superhero who fights crime & evil , speaking of evil an ancient Japanese legend states that every 1000 years ' the evil one ' will take form on earth & well generally be evil & this is the year so Kabukiman is charged with the task of stooping him . Directed by the ' brains ' behind Troma Michael Herz & Lloyd Kaufman this is actually far better than I expected considering their general output . The script by Kaufman , Andrew Osborne & Jeffrey W . Sass is a clear homage to the superhero genre with some mildly amusing scenes that rip-off the likes of Batman , The Incredible Hulk , Spider-Man & Superman . Not everything works but at least it tries without having to resort to the stupid , childish gross out humour & violence most Troma films rely on & in fact this is surprisingly restrained & light hearted compared to a lot of Troma's output , whether this is a good or bad thing I'll let you decide but I thought it made watching it a lot easier . Everything about Sgt . Kabukiman N . Y . P . D . seems just that bit better than the usual Troma film which obviously helps , it isn't going to win any awards but as trashy entertainment that makes you smile on occasion it's not too bad . Director's Herz & Kaufman do OK , while still not up to Hollywood standards this has a greater level of technical competence than any other Troma film I can remember . As already mentioned this is surprisingly tame , apparently available in two versions of differing strength I'm not sure which one I saw but as far as gore goes there's some people shot in the head , some is attacked by a Tiger & eaten plus there's a silly blue demon monster thing at the end . This probably had a slightly bigger budget than the usual Troma & it show's , apparently this didn't get distributed in the States until 1996 some 5 years after it was initially made . Again while the acting isn't going to win any awards it's much better than in most Troma films . Sgt . Kabukiman N . Y . P . D . isn't too bad a film & one if watched in the right mood provides a few decent laughs although you have to be of a certain disposition to enjoy stuff like this . Worth a watch for those twisted souls wanting something a bit different .
" Whatever your drinking or smoking stop it . . . or share it out . " So-so creature feature , average .	The Bone Snatcher starts in the ' Nambi Desert South Africa ' where Clive ( Sean Higgs ) , Paul ( Langley Kirkwood ) & Harvey ( Jan Ellis ) three diamond prospectors are , well prospecting for diamonds . Unfortunatelty for them they discover something rather nasty lurking under the sand . . . Jump to ' Vancouver British Columbia ' where systems analyst Dr . Zack Straker ( Scott Bairstow ) is told that he has to go to the Namib Desert to do a bit of field work , analysing systems I guess . Jump back to the Namib Desert & Zack has arrived at ' Eland Mining ' , he has to pass security before he is driven to the main complex . The three prospectors have been reported missing & the security guys are going to pick them up on the way , attractive female Mikki ( Rachel Shelly ) , Karl ( Warrick Grier ) , Titus ( Patrick Shai ) , Kurt ( Andre Weiman ) & the driver Magda ( Adrienne Pierce ) are the rescue team . It's not long before they run into the prospectors abandoned truck & nearby discover the remains of two of them , the bones stripped of all the flesh . Karl decides the third prospector was responsible & they set off in search of him but only find his bones as well , they also discover that there is something nasty out there lurking in the bleak isolation of the Desert . . . This English , Canadian & South African co-production was directed by Jason Wulfsohn & is fair to middling entertainment . The script by Malcolm Kohll & Gordon Render is a little slow to get going , after the three prospectors meet their ends at the start no-one else dies for over 40 minutes & is rather clichéd , the attractive female , the computer nerd , the tough macho guy , the religious nut-case there to add a supernatural spin on things & , of course , the disposable character's merely there to die & do very little else . The creature itself is disappointing in the sense that it turns out to be a collection of ants that steal peoples bones so they can use them as a skeleton & walk around , why exactly ? Surely just walking across the ground would be just as efficient ? Add that to the fact that all they want to do is find a new nest & aren't bothered about killing anyone it all becomes rather lacklustre & dull . I don't particularly understand the need to hunt them down & destroy them either , as I've said they don't purposely set out to kill anyone & they are buried deep in the Namib Desert far from civilisation . Having said that it provides fair entertainment & is far from the worse horror film ever but at the same time far from the best & in keeping with the rest of the film the climax is dull & by-the-numbers . Director Wulfsohn can't exactly do much with the monotonous Desert locations & it starts to get tedious to look at . Most of it takes place during broad daylight which doesn't help the atmosphere & it lacks any real tension or excitement . Forget about any gore because there isn't any , a few bones & someone has their arm devoured . The creature itself is a mixture of both CGI & traditional puppet effects which are decent enough & look OK . With a surprisingly healthy $6 , 000 , 000 budget The Bone Snatcher comes across as a missed opportunity & where did all the money go exactly ? The entire thing is set in the Desert , the creature & CGI effects are used sparingly , there are no action scenes or big set pieces & no big name actors . Six big ones sounds like a lot of money considering what ended up on screen . The acting is annoying & most of the cast talk in thick South African accents which sometimes makes it a bit difficult to understand them . The Bone Snatcher is an OK way to pass 85 minutes but is far from spectacular , in fact average is the word I'd use . I can't say I hated it but I can't say I liked either , disappointing .
Not too bad .	Ghost Story is set in the small new England town of Milburn where four elderly friends have formed the Chowder Society in which they regularly tell each other ghost stories . After the death of his son David ( Graig Wasson ) the Mayor & Chowder Society member Edward Wanderley ( Douglas Fairbanks Jr . ) is visited by his other son Don ( Craig Wasson again ) , soon after Edward is killed when he falls off a bridge . Edward's death is put down as a suicide but Don & the other members of the Chowder Society aren't so sure , they have all been suffering from nightmares & they all fear that a dark secret from their past may be back to take revenge on them & their families . . . Opening in US theatres a week before Christmas 1981 & directed by John Irvin this big budget A-list Hollywood horror film is a pretty entertaining way to pass 110 minutes if nothing truly spectacular The script by Lawrence D . Cohen was based on the novel of the same name by Peter Straub which spent five weeks in the best sellers list , I have never read the novel but by all accounts the filmed adaptation is significantly different to the 700 plus page novel although on a basic level the story about supernatural revenge remains the same . To state the obvious Ghost Story is a story about ghosts & it's a slow burner as it takes it's time to build up the situation & character's , it's certainly not the most incident or action packed horror flick your ever likely to see that's for sure . It also has an odd narrative which twice goes into a lengthy flashback sequence the first of which is almost totally pointless & could just have easily been achieved by a few lines of dialogue between a couple of the character's . Everything is nice enough , the character's , the setting , the dialogue , the fact that since Ghost Story is a Hollywood flick it is relatively restrained & maybe could have done with a few gory set-piece deaths . It's a little bit too routine , a bit too predictable & for a horror flick just a bit too nice & cosy . I liked it , I thought the story held my attention & just about enough happened to stop me losing interest but you can't help but feel Ghost Story as a ghost story had more potential than what ended up on screen . I thought the ending was a bit of an anti-climax & virtually nothing is made of the escaped occultist's Gregory & Fenny . Director Irvin does alright , he manages to capture a nice small town mood during the scenes in the snow covered Milburn . This has a couple of effective jump moments especially one on a bridge . There's a scene at the start when someone falls out of a skyscraper window naked & we follow him down to the ground which is actually an unintentionally funny scene because the guy is naked & the special optical effects are poor . The sparingly used special make-up effects on the other hand by Dick Smith are superb , it's just a pity they weren't used more often . The zombie make-up really is excellent & as good as anything from any zombie film . The actual gore levels are low , in fact I can't remember any significant blood spillage at all , even when a character cracks their head against a stone fireplace there isn't a drop of blood to be seen . Technically the film is very good with high production values , I didn't like the music that much but it didn't hurt the film too much . The cast includes some heavyweight actors from the early years of Hollywood , Ghost Story would be the final film for both Fred Astaire & Douglas Fairbanks Jr . who have impressive & extensive filmographies . I would have also thought Ghost Story was their one & only appearance in a horror film . Ghost Story is an OK ghost story as it were , it's perfectly watchable , it's well made & it has a distinguished cast but it's all a bit too pedestrian & a little bit safe for my liking . Good but not great .
" When you have the gun you can ask the questions . . . ' Average at best .	They Are Among Us is set in the small American town of Point Ridge where your average American teenager Daniel ( Michael DiLallo ) lives at home with his mum Collette ( Anne Apra ) & dad Hugh ( Bruce Boxleitner ) & generally does what the teenage youth of America do . However Daniel's 18th birthday is fast approaching & his parents are acting strangely , they have always guarded a box & Daniel is interested what's inside so along with his mates Harlan ( Michael maples ) & Devon ( Lacey Beeman ) he steals the box & has a look inside where he finds some strange feeling paper with some unknown symbols on it . Daniel's parents continue to act odd & he is convinced something is going on , the three friends then meet a woman named Finley ( Alison Eastwood ) who claims that their town is in fact a colony of aliens who use the skills of crooked plastic surgeon Norbert ( Corbin Bernsen ) to help them retain a human appearance & that Daniel's mum is in fact one of these aliens . As you would expect the news that his mum is an alien comes as somewhat of a shock but after seeing proof he sets about putting an end to the aliens before they contaminate the whole Earth . . . Co-produced & directed by Jeffrey Obrow I thought They Are Among Us was average at best . The script by Lars Hauglie takes itself extremely seriously & is badly structured . For the first 45 minutes They Are Among Us tries to be a mystery & build up to the shocking revelation that aliens are among us , unfortunately the narrative is poor & unlike any good mystery there is nothing within that opening 45 minutes to hold your interest to hook you or engage . Sure there's a couple of brief scenes with an alien in them but apart from that I found it both dull & forgettable . While watching They Are Among Us I was thinking that it could be some nightmarish mutant offspring of a cheap rejected episode of The X-Files ( 1993 - 2002 ) , Invasion of the Body Snatchers ( either the 1956 one or the 1978 remake ) & Dawson's Creek ( 1998 - 2003 ) . The character's are poor , the dialogue is poor & there's not one single surprise within the entire film while the ending leaves everything wide open & doesn't really resolve anything . Having said that it's reasonably well paced & might pass 100 odd minutes painlessly enough if your not too demanding . Oh , & one more thing for those that have seen it you'll know what I'm talking about but what the hell happened to the missing friend Langford ( Garikayi Mutambirwa ) ? One minute he seemed vital to the plot & the next poof he's never seen , heard or mentioned again ! Director Obrow films like an episode from a TV show which comes as no surprise since it was made-for-TV . The whole thing looks flat , unadventurous & utterly forgettable . The special effects are few & far between , there's basically a couple of aliens & it's just some guy with sharp teeth & funny coloured skin while at the end for some reason that is never really explained there's big alien that appears from nowhere & then just disappears into thin air . Forget about any blood or gore as there isn't any . There's no tension or atmosphere & there's definitely no scares while the main villain is some old geezer with bad hair . Technically They Are Among Us is reasonable , it's quite well made but it's all rather average . The acting wasn't great & I'm sure some of the cast were chosen for their looks rather than their acting skill of which they have little . They Are Among Us is nothing special , it didn't do much for me although at least I watched it to the end with having to use the fast forward button on my remote . Not recommended .
" I was born to murder the World . " Average & overlong horror .	Lord of Illusions starts with a paragraph of text that reads ' There are two worlds of magic . One is the glittering domain of the illusionist . The other is a secret place , where magic is a terrifying reality . Here , men have the power of demons . And death itself is an illusion . ' The film then cuts to the ' Mojave Desert 1982 ' where at an isolated house an evil magician named Nix ( Daniel von Bargen ) & his brainwashed cult of followers have sex , walk around naked , write messages in blood on the walls & generally behave in an anti-social way . Phillip Swann ( Kevin J . O'Connor ) , Casper Quaid ( Joseph Latimore ) , Jennifer Desiderio ( Sheila Tousey ) & Maureen Pimm ( Susan Taylor ) pull up outside , they enter the house fully armed with the intention of putting an end to Nix's evil ways & rescuing a young girl ( Ashley Cafagna-Tesoro as Ashley Lyn Cafagna ) whom he has taken hostage . They all think they put an end to Nix when Swann screws a metal mask onto his face , they then bury him deep in the desert . A rainy ' New York 13 Years Later ' where private detective Harry D'Amour ( Scott Bakula ) is given a insurance fraud job by a friend named Loomis ( Wayne Grace ) which involves tracking a man named Tapert ( Johnny Venocur as Johnny Venokur ) down in Los Angeles . While following Tapert D'Amour discovers Casper Quaid dying having been cut up by one of Nix's cult members Butterfeild ( Barry Del Sherman ) , D'Amour quickly becomes involved in his death & is hired by Dorothea Swann ( Famke Janssen ) the wife of Phillip who is now apparently the best illusionist in the world . Dorothea knew that Phillip & Quaid have connections & fears that Phillip may be next on the killers hit-list . What D'Amour finds is a trail of lies , deceit , murder & the possible resurrection of the evil Nix . . . Written , co-produced & directed Clive Barker I thought Lord of Illusions was an OK film , nothing more . I should point out at this time that the version I am reviewing is the longer ' director's cut ' released on DVD so bear that in mind , there are also some extra ' deleted scenes ' on the DVD which are short & offer nothing in the way of additional story development . The script by Barker based on his novel ' The Last Illusion ' tries to mix horror , mystery & the private detective genre with little success . Put quite simply there wasn't enough of a mystery element for me , I found the story extremely uninvolving & dull to watch . In fact Lord of Illusions totally ditches the detective story well before the end & goes into straight horror mode as Nix comes back from the grave for a standard ' hero kills bad guy & gets the pretty girl ' ending , very disappointing as there is no twist or anything that I really didn't see coming . I never really cared for any of the characters & the silly plot devices Barker employs to further the already ridiculous premise stretch Lord of Illusions credibility to breaking point as Barker treats the material with deadly seriousness . On a positive side Lord of Illusions looks great with it's cinematography & use of colour showing how Barker has developed since his debut , the infinitely superior Hellraiser ( 1987 ) . Tecnically Lord of Illusions is great apart from a couple of the optical effects which don't impress . Barker also continues his love affair with religious symbolism & bondage imagery , I mean just check that metal spiked mask out . There are one or two decent gore scenes but don't expect another Hellraiser , someone is impaled with swords , gunshot wounds splattering blood everywhere , nails being screwed into peoples heads , dead animals , stabbings with scalpels & peoples skin coming off their faces . The acting is OK but I thought Bakula was miscast & didn't feel right for the role , Janssen is still a babe & easy on the eyes . Overall I thought Lord of Illusions was an OK horror film which for the most part unsuccessfully tries to blend various genres , it's a bit different if not exactly gripping in the way I'm sure Barker had intended & it has it's moments but at the end of the day it provides little entertainment , nothing in the way of surprises & you will have forgotten about it within a week . Average at best , but still worth watching if your desperate .
" I thought you were a blood sucking leech but was I wrong , your a lot lower than that . " Religious themed Quincy episode .	Quincy M . E . : By Their Faith starts as Asten ( John S . Ragin ) sends medical examiner Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) & laboratory assistant Sam Fujiama ( Robert Ito ) to San Remos in Mexico by request of Archbishop Vallejo ( René Enríquez ) in order to help authenticate one way or the other ancient remains that have been found there . A local village girl named Jacinta Gonsales ( Eugenia Wright ) found some bones in a cave which she believes belonged to famous 16th century Spanish missionary Fei Deigo , Jacinta claims that she now has the power to miraculously cure disease , sickness & ailments . With religious people flocking to her from all corners of the globe seeking a ' miracle cure ' Quincy fears that with no proper medical attention at the site many will die or even worse spread deadly disease throughout the region . . . Episode 7 from season 6 this Quincy story was directed by Ron Satlof & this is maybe the only religious themed episode of Quincy that was made . For obvious reasons absolute hard scientific fact of the sort a scientist like Quincy would deal in & superstitious religion which comes down to belief which you can't see under a microscope or bottle in a test tube contradict each other & are at opposite ends of the story telling scale which is probably why the production team kept the two separate for the majority of the show & even here in By Their Faith the focus of the story is more on the disease those looking to be miraculously cured bring with them & the race against time to get them proper medical help . By Their Faith nails it's colours to it's mast , miracle cures do not work although those who offer them sincerely believe that they have the power to heal & that media hysteria is to blame . Like a good few episodes from season five By Their Faith takes place entirely outside the traditional Los Angeles laboratory setting apart from Asten's office at the very start , here it's a small Mexican village which is actually never seen & resembles a dusty field as much as anything else . There's no murder here , there's no mystery & while it's nice to get varied story lines By Their Faith isn't one of my favourite episodes as there's not much here to really get excited about & the traditional Quincy elements that make the show so enjoyable for me are largely absent here . This episode also touches upon the effect of irresponsible journalism & not reporting the facts . The start of the episode sees Quincy get covered in mud in a comedy moment while there are a few continuity issues regarding Quincy's sweat patterns on his shirt , they disappear & change size all the time between shots . Even this is meant to be set in a Mexican village the budget didn't stretch to build one so we get a dusty clearing in a wood , I wouldn't even go as far as to call it a field ! The acting is alright if unremarkable . By Their Faith is an alright episode of Quincy , it's not one of the best from the series but it's not one of the worst either . I am always disappointed not to see a murder or a mystery so this was never going to be one of my favourites .
Average Quincy episode .	Quincy M . E . : Nowhere to Run starts as Los Angeles coroner Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) is called to a crime scene , the body of a teenage girl named Melissa Watson ( Nancy Carol ) is at the bottom of a very high cliff & her boyfriend Jeff Cavanaugh ( Bill Beyers ) is Lt . Monahan's ( Garry Walberg ) prime suspect even though it was he who phoned the police . Jeff claims that he tried to stop Melissa from jumping off the edge of the cliff but failed while Monahan believes Jeff deliberately pushed her off . Jeff manages to convince Quincy that he is telling the truth but the findings of his autopsy on Melissa prove nothing to collaborate Jeff's story , then Quincy discovers that Melissa was pregnant . Jeff denies it was his & Quincy is convinced that the reason Melissa committed suicide is tied in with her pregnancy & he sets out to find the father . . . Episode 8 from season 5 this Quincy story was directed by Jeffrey Hayden & one has to say Nowhere to Run isn't amongst my favourite Quincy episodes . For a start Nowhere to Run has dated badly , very badly with extremely outdated scientific procedures . I know that Nowhere to Run is a product of it's time & medical science has come a long way but the idea that Quincy can't tell who the father of Melissa's baby was seems almost unthinkable these days with DNA testing & the like . How many Jerry Springer type talk show's have done the old ' is the baby yours ' routine with it's guests , revealing the results of the DNA test on stage for maximum humiliation & impact ? So straight away Nowhere to Run is a difficult episode to relate to , then there's the main plot revolving around incest . Right , well it's odd that I should see a Quincy episode about incest this week as a few days ago it came to light that a seventy three year old Austrian man named Josef Fritzl fathered six children with his forty two year old daughter Elizabeth , ironically it's the DNA testing that this episode of Quincy lacks that has proved it , so these sorts of things do indeed happen but I doubt if any of the Fritzl's neighbours had watched Nowhere to Run things would have turned out differently as I would imagine it's almost impossible to spot & very unpleasant to even contemplate . I mean a grown man slipping his one eyed monster in & out of his daughter's love basket & filling her up with his man juice every night ? It's not really something you can bring up over casual conversation is it ? At a brisk fifty odd minutes ( without commercials ) it moves along at a decent pace & it's watchable enough but it is rather predictable & it lacks any sort of mystery element . The very start of Nowhere to Run sees Quincy having to attend to a body at the bottom of a cliff & he actually abseils down there & then climbs back up ! When he reaches the top he isn't out of breath & there's not a single drop of sweat on him either , even if a man of his age could haul himself up a sheer cliff face I find it hard to believe he wouldn't be sweating buckets . Deputy DA Barnes makes one of his seven appearances in a role which I think the production team were trying to make a regular one . Neither Danny nor his bar feature at all during this one . The acting is alright but it's Klugman as usual who shine's . Nowhere to Run is average Quincy , it tries to tread the line between being moralistic & mysterious but gets it wrong with both elements being far too predictable & forced . A nice try but it didn't really work so good , still worth a watch though .
" You've been with the dead too long , it's time you dealt with the living . " Average Quincy episode .	Quincy M . E . : Matters of Life and Death starts as Asten ( John S . Ragin ) tells Quincy that he has become unbearable , bad tempered & grouchy . Asten tells Quincy that one of his friends a local small town Doctor named Max Gilliam ( Walter Brooke ) is going away on vacation for a month & he wants someone to take over his general practise for that period which Quincy agrees to . However before he even reaches the town ( hell , before the opening credits even finish ) Quincy runs into trouble , the dead body of Vincenzo Maggiore & if that wasn't enough Quincy finds dealing with the living can sometimes be just as difficult as dealing with the dead with all sorts of problems of it own . . . Episode 14 from season 3 this Quincy story was directed by Paul Kransy & is decent enough but not one of the show's best . This is one of those Quincy episodes where all the action & incident happens outside the traditional laboratory setting for those of you who like these sorts of episodes , it works well enough I suppose but it's just a bit lethargic with a couple of pretty dull story lines about a pregnant woman with twins & the mysterious circumstances surrounding a man's death neither of which are that great or particularly hold your interest , well not mine anyway . It's a bit predictable as well if I'm honest with a pretty lacklustre ending although watching Quincy fighting against & shouting down bureaucrats & red tape is alway fun in it's own right . Don't get me wrong , Matters of Life and Death is alright but nothing special & by Quincy standards nothing to write home about . As one would expect due to largely being set outside the laboratory & outside Los Angeles only one of the regular character's appear until the cheesy comedy happy ending at Danny's . The acting is OK but Klugman stands out as usual & he is just great in the title role . Matters of Life and Death is an average Quincy episode , the two slim story lines aren't really enough to carry it & as it stands it's one of the poorer episodes from the third season .
A dull moralistic Quincy to end season 7 .	Quincy M . E . : The Mourning After starts late one night as three college students are about to undergo an initiation which when complete will allow them acceptance into a fraternity , the boys have to swim to a buoy on an open lake & back again the only catch is their drunk & have had their hands tied together with rope . Two of the lads make it but Carey Stadler ( Timothy Wead ) doesn't & ends up on L . A . coroner Quincy's ( Jack Klugman ) autopsy table , it looks like an open & shut case of drowning but the facts don't match the story given to the police . Quincy investigates & discovers that Carey died because of a stupid tradition & sets out to prove it , meanwhile Carey's brother Nick ( Timothy Patrick Murphy ) feels cheated by the police who can't do anything & wants revenge on those who let his brother die . . . Episode 24 from season 7 this Quincy story was directed by Jeri Taylor & was the final episode from season 7 , I didn't really like The Mourning After that much & in a nutshell it demonstrates everything that has been bad during season 7 . Most of season 7 has drifted between heavy handed & frankly dull social & moral issues to the more familiar crime mystery based stories which I infinitely prefer while it occasionally mixes the two sometimes to good effect & sometimes like The Mourning After the show isn't so successful , The Mourning After is one of those episodes which contains both moral & crime based issues although a large amount of time is spent with the Stadler family & the affect Carey's death has on them , it also raises the issue of hazing while Quincy actually investigating Carey's death is frustratingly given very little screen time . I'm all for a TV show with a moral point to make & Quincy does have a wide variety of different story lines which it tackles but the TV actors aren't good enough to convince , the writing isn't strong enough & the crime element of Quincy is always so much more interesting & entertaining than a dull conscious pricking topic such as hazing & grief . Don't get me wrong because whenever someone dies someone is grieving for them but that just doesn't make good TV , does it ? I really have to mention the guest actor's here , they are trying to convey some pretty serious emotions but the ones on show here are just so bad I was cringing with embarrassment at times . This episode is just to heavy handed & has no sense of humour at all , even the feel good comedy moment at Danny's is absent & is replaced with a sombre speech from Quincy . The Mourning After ( isn't that a great play on words ? ) wasn't a good way to end season 7 & it encompasses everything that I dislike about the show , far too much ineffectual moralising & too little of Quincy solving a crime . Simple as that really , now bring on season 8 . . .
" It's alive . . . " I quite liked it actually .	Frankenstein is set in London where genetic scientist Victoria ( Helen McCrory ) is working on pioneering stem-cell research , however her young son William is dying & will die unless he gets a multiple organ transplant . Wishing to help her son Victoria uses his DNA in her stem-cell research , she sets up an experiment to genetically create the organs he needs . William dies & Victoria decides to abandon the research but her boss Professor Andrew Waldman ( Neil Pearson ) feels her work is too important to destroy & carries it on . Unfortunately the DNA starts to mutate , it starts to mutate into some humanoid shaped mutant creature . When a power surge cuts the electric in the laboratory the genetically created mutant creature manages to escape into the night . . . Written & directed by Jeb Mercurio I quite liked this despite having little in common with Mary Shelley's novel from which it takes it's title . Made for & recently aired on British TV I suppose this got the go ahead after a recent spate of classic horror adaptation including Sweeney Todd ( 2006 ) with Ray Winstone , the six part series Jekyll ( 2007 ) with James Nesbitt & a feature length Dracula ( 2006 ) with David Suchet , however Frankenstein doesn't have any ' names ' in it & has little connection with it's literally source . For a start no-one is called Frankenstein & for that matter the word Frankenstein is never mentioned once . Then there's the one basic aspect of the novel which the makers of this have seen fit to disregard , the fact that Frankenstein is a man & not a woman . Now , I'm all for equal opportunities for both sexes but Frankenstein is a bloke , he always has been & always will be . Then there's the fact modern genetic techniques are used to create the monster rather than stitching various body parts together which is fine in itself since this is meant to be a contemporary adaptation . At 75 odd minutes it doesn't last too long , it moves along at a reasonable pace , it's pretty entertaining for what it is but it stalls & falters once the Frankenstein monster is captured , there are too many mysterious Government secret service officials dressed in black & I didn't like the abrupt ending either . This looks alright , it's well made but nothing spectacular . The Frankenstein monster is kept hidden for the most part , which once it is actually shown you'll see why . I suppose the look of the monster is supposed to incite sympathy for it but for most it will probably incite laughter , the actual special effect on it is OK . There's a brief nod to the original Frankenstein as the monster here has a paralysing device stuck into his neck which resembles the look of a large bolt ! This is also one of the few films I've seen which actually kills a child on screen , not only does the monster kill a young girl who he tries to befriend after she rejects him ( another homage or maybe rip-off to the original Frankenstein ( 1931 ) ? ) but it actually show's the monster breaking her neck in a sequence which just leaves a bad taste in the mouth . Otherwise there isn't much gore or violence , a few burnt corpses is as graphic as it gets . Frankenstein is an OK way to 75 minutes but don't expect a faithful adaptation because this is anything but , taken in it's own right it's decent enough but nothing overly special .
" The old head in a fish tank routine . " OK but somewhat dull thriller / horror .	Night School starts with various nighttime shots of the Boston skyline as the credits play , Night School then switches to the ' Jack-n-Jill Daycare Center ' where the children are leaving for the day . One of the teaching staff named Anne Barron ( Meb Boden ) is sitting on a roundabout when a mysterious figure approaches wearing full bikers leather gear with a blacked out helmet . After playing with Anne for a bit the biker takes a large curved knife out & decapitates her . Bostons finest , Lieutenant Judd Austin ( Leonard Mann ) & his partner Detective Taj ( Joseph R . Sicari ) are on the case . This is the second decapitation within a week & the only clues they have to go on are that Anne's head was placed in a bucket of water while the first victim's was placed in a duck pond & that Anne was a night student sitting Anthropology at ' Wendell College ' . Lt . Austin speaks with Anne's teacher a one Professor Vincent Millett ( Drew Snyder ) who seems to be a bit of a ladies man & likes to have affairs with his students . He also speaks with one of Anne's close friends Kim Morrison ( Elizabeth Barnitz ) who informs Lt . Austin that she thinks Anne was having an affair with someone but doesn't know who . Before long Kim's decapitated head is found in a fish tank & a local waitress named Carol ( Karen MacDonald ) also loses her head in unfortunate circumstances . But who is responsible ? Maybe it's Professor Millett whom all the evidence seems to conveniently point to ? Or maybe it's Gary Downe ( Bill McCann ) a peeping tom who had connections with at least one of the victims ? Or how about the schools principal Helene Griffin ( Annette Miller ) & lets not forget Eleanor Adjai ( Rachel Ward ) who also both keep turning up during the course of Lt . Austin's investigations ? Who knows , watch it if you want to find out . . . Directed by Ken Hughes I thought Night School was a reasonable horror film that also could probably be classed as much a psychological thriller as straight slasher . The script by co-producer Ruth Avergon tries to be a murder mystery , keeping the killers identity secret until the end . It's a little slow & dull on occasion with director's Hughes bland & forgettable film-making style not helping it along that much . Don't expect a bloodbath of mutilated teenagers like a Friday the 13th ( 1980 ) because the body count is actually quite low as the film concentrates a bit to much on set up & characters for my liking . There aren't really enough suspects for the mystery element to work properly , neither does the film give many clues away & the red herrings are a bit obvious . You'll either guess the killer by luck or you won't , there's no real method involved here . As for the killer's eventual identity , well it's OK I suppose & the motive is a bit different but once again director Hughes doesn't make the most out of it & it ends up being only mildly interesting . To give Hughes some credit that double twist ending , although strange , works fairly well . The murders aren't overly gory & have far to long a build up with people walking around , hearing strange noises etc . , the best being when a victim is attacked in a white tiled room & her blood spraying over the walls . Other than that the only gore is a few brief shots of severed heads , disappointingly the process of them being severed is never shown . Yes Rachel Ward does have a shower scene , & yes Drew Snyder gets to rub red paint over her naked body , hey it's nice work if you can get it eh Drew ? In my opinion neither of these scenes are particularly sexy though . There is also a brief lesbian scene too . Night School has good solid production values throughout but it's a little flat & unexciting to watch , it's all very middle of the road stuff as it's not bad but it's not particularly good . The acting in Night School is pretty good by all involved except Rachel Ward who is simply terrible & just check the scenes out when she tries to be emotional , at times it's embarrassing to watch . Night School is just an average horror / thriller that is an OK watch but isn't going to make anyones top ten that's for sure . Just about worth watching if you can catch it on T . V . for free or find a cheap copy somewhere .
Better than the first .	Spider-Man 2 is set about two years after the events of the original where Peter Parker ( Tobey Maguire ) now lives in New York City & is having all sorts of problems , he has no money , the fact he is Spider-Man is destroying his relationship with both his childhood love Mary Jane ( Kirsten Dunst ) & his best friend Harry Osborn ( James Franco ) & his schoolwork is suffering . Parker decides to leave Spider-Man behind & just live his life , while researching a college project about scientist Dr . Otto Octavius ( Alfred Molina ) Parker is invited to a demonstration of Octavius ' new fusion based energy source but the demonstration goes wrong . The four mechanical arms attached to Octavious designed to help him work malfunction & take control of his mind turning him into a crazed madman intent on finishing his dangerous experiments even if means the destruction of New York , that is unless Spider-Man can stop him . . . Directed by Sam Raimi this was the sequel to the blockbusting live action Spider-Man ( 2002 ) that went into production before the original even opened to such impressive box-office numbers , on a personal level I actually slightly prefer Spider-Man 2 to the original . The script by Alvin Sargent based on the popular Marvel comic book character is a continuation of many plot lines from the original , Peter's relationship with Mary Jane & Harry , his feelings of guilt over his uncle's death , his superpowers ruining his normal life & his coming to terms with his powers . In fact almost the entire first hour & a half feels like a soap opera with the film firmly focused on Peter Parker's various problems & dramas , the character of Doc Ock is relegated to a minor role for the majority of the film which is my biggest gripe with Spider-Man 2 really . I mean I don't want to watch a film such as Spider-Man 2 & find myself looking at a bland soap opera , I want special effects , I want spectacular action set-pieces & I want cool imaginative villains . Like many recent films there are at least a couple of different versions available , the original theatrical & DVD cut , the Spider-Man 2 . 1 extended cut & maybe even another different TV version , I really hate this practise of putting multiple versions out by big studios . The standard theatrical cut runs for a little over two hours & despite some truly outstanding action sequences I felt overall it was rather uneventful & I just ended up sitting there during the soap opera type moments waiting for Doc Ock to show up again . Director Raimi does a fine job here & there are some amazing set-piece action scenes , the fight Spider-Man & Doc Ock have on the speeding train in particular is spectacular . Apparently the CGI computer effects budget was $54 million & most of the CGI is outstanding & as good as anything out there , from dizzy shots of Spider-Man swinging through the streets of New York to Doc Ock's tentacles who all have individual personalities & another amazing scene when Spider-Man & Doc Ock have a fight on the side of a building . I have to say Doc Ock is maybe my favourite Spider-Man villain , I used to watch the old 60's cartoon series , & I'm a bit disappointed with him here . I not disappointed in how he looks , with a combination of CGI & puppet effects the character looks amazing with some great shots of him walking & climbing using his tentacles but he just wasn't evil enough for me , his whole plan was to carry on with his fusion energy source machine & nothing else . He didn't want to take over the world , he didn't want any money , he didn't even want to hurt anyone & his motives just seemed weak & uninteresting . Also , if the tentacles took over his mind & were partly controlling him what did they want ? What difference to them would it have made if he had finished his fusion machine ? One more thing , I understand that the tentacles were strong but surely Doctor Octavius was still a normal human being , while the tentacles could have survived falling 1000's of feet from a skyscraper onto a moving train why did Doctor Octavius as a normal human being survive ? As I said I thought he was still human , there was nothing in the film to indicate he suddenly became invincible , was there ? I know it's a comic book superhero film but it still needs to be based in some sort of reality for it to work . With a supposed budget of about $200 , 000 , 000 this was the most expensive film ever made at the time along with Titanic ( 1997 ) , this definitely has that big budget Hollywood look & feel & has exceptional special effects & is very well made . The original score by Danny Elfman was replaced by one from Christopher Young at the last minute who composed the music for Hellraiser ( 1987 ) , if you listen the first time Doctor Octavius walks towards the fusion device during the demonstration & while he is working on it the music is exactly the same as in Hellraiser ! Set in New York but filmed in both New York & Los Angeles . The acting is fine , J . K . Simmons as Parker's boss J . Johna Jameson puts in another funny performance while Molina is pretty good as Doc Ock & Willem Defoe makes a small cameo at the end . Spider-Man 2 , or the 2 . 1 extended cut , is a good solid comic book superhero film that wastes a great villain in Doc Ock & only has some spectacular action set-piece sequences going for it . The dull drama about Peter Parker's personal life drags it down to slightly above average , good but not great . Followed by Spider-Man 3 ( 2007 ) & Spider-Man 4 ( 2009 ) .
Surprisingly decent low budget horror mystery .	The Darkroom starts in a hospital where an amnesia suffer ( Reed Diamond ) has spent the last 15 years , he was found wandering on a forest road covered in mud & blood & nobody has any idea who he is least of all himself . However a Dr . Allen ( Ellie Cornall ) who works for a private company has developed a new drug designed to help people remember & it's currently going through clinical trials & this guy has been chosen as a human Guinea pig , Dr . Allen administers the drug & the man has violent convulsions . When he recovers he claims not to remember anything & is taken back to his room , however on the way another patient attacks some members of staff & in the confusion he manages to escape the hospital . Once outside in L . A . he befriends a young boy named Stanley ( Shawn Pyform ) , the more time he spends around Stanley the more he remembers as if Stanley was once part of his life all those years ago . . . Co-written & directed by Michael Hurst I actually thought The Darkroom was a pretty decent time waster , sure it ain't going to make anyone's top ten best films anytime soon but it's perfectly watchable in it's own right . The script by Hurst & producer Mark A . Altman which takes itself extremely seriously is basically one long build up to it's twist ending & not much more , I have to say I thought the ending was pretty good as it wasn't too over-the-top or silly & is pretty cool . I personally didn't see it coming until late in the film & I don't think it's twist which is too predictable either . I'm sure if you sit down & pick the film apart then you could probably find all sorts of plot holes but as an immediate out the blue twist I thought it worked very well . However , the film is maybe a touch on the slow side & the impatient among you may not last the ride , several things aren't exactly explained clearly & it tries too hard at the end to tie everything up together & give itself a feel good happy ending . I thought the character's were good as was the dialogue without being outstanding , I thought it was something just that bit different & overall I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked The Darkroom , I also thought the mystery elements were pretty engaging & they at least kept me watching . Director Hurst does alright , the film doesn't have much style but it's well made at least . I'm not really sure who the target audience for The Darkroom is as it's not really a horror film , I would struggle to call it a thriller as well so I'm not sure . This is a hard one to categorise as it has elements of both . This contains quite a few gory blood spurting slit throats which are quite graphic although they occur mostly during dream sequences & there's also a mud monster thing as well that turns up every so often . The special effects are fine with the slit throats looking particularly good & I'm pleased to report I didn't notice any awful CGI computer effects . Technically the film is good & a hell of a lot better made than many recent straight-to-video low budget horror themed junk out there , it's well made throughout with decent production values & it actually looks like a proper film . The acting is OK , Xena : Warrior Princess ( 1995 - 2001 ) star Lucy Lawless is the only recognisable cast member as far as I was concerned . The Darkroom is a good attempt at a psychological horror film with a twist & in that regard it's a watchable effort , it's nothing that will change your life but you could do a lot worse that's for sure .
Decent horror film .	Castle Freak starts as American John Reilly ( Jeffrey Combs ) inherits a large 700 year old castle in Italy , he travels there with his blind daughter Rebecca ( Jessica Dollarhide ) & his wife Susan ( Barbara Crampton ) who has never quite forgiven him for killing their son & blinding Rebecca in a car accident . However there is a dark secret lurking in the castle , a secret that has been hidden for decades but now it's free , it has nine fingers & wears a bed-sheet . Oh , & it's also a deformed cannibalistic killer . . . Co-written & directed by Stuart Gordon I thought Castle Freak was a decent enough horror film but didn't quite reach the heights of greatness . The script by Gordon & Dennis Paoli was based on the story ' The Outsider ' by H . P . Lovecraft & is a reasonable way to pass 90 odd minutes but I just felt there was nothing here that really stood out & grabbed my attention , you know what I mean ? There's the family who inherit a property with a dark secret & that's about it only we know what the dark secret is within five minutes because the freak monster is seen even before the opening credits have started . Also , why didn't the freak bite his own thumb off years ago to escape ? How did it open the huge locked cell door exactly ? Who put & subsequently removed the picture of John's dead son in the family crypt ? The body counts consists of exactly four , it's hardly the most exciting film ever made & it just feels a bit too routine , predictable & ultimately rather forgettable as there just seemed to be too many shots of people walking / running around the same corridors . It's still a good horror film make no mistake about it & has some positives going for it but I think I'd have completely forgotten about it by the end of the week . Director Gordon knows how to turn in a decent flick & Castle Freak is a nice enough looking film , it has a a great setting & the real castle location adds to the atmosphere immensely . There are some creepy moments but don't let anyone fool you into thinking this reaches the gory heights of Gordon's Re-Animator ( 1985 ) or From Beyond ( 1987 ) as there's not much gore here , the one & only real gore scene involves the freak biting the nipple off a prostitute & then there's some shots of her dead body with further bite marks & a bit when someone has some skin bitten off their face , the special make-up effects are good on the freak & there's a fair amount of blood splatter but overall this isn't that gory . Technically the film is good , certainly better & classier than the majority of Full Moon productions that's for sure . Actually being shot in a real castle ( owned by the head of Full Moon ) in Italy helps give the film a great look . The acting is pretty good , it's always nice to see Combs in a genre film & he is reunited with Crampton as they both appeared together in a couple of other Gordon horror films Re-Animator & From Beyond . Castle Freak is a watchable , well made & perfectly decent horror film but while I definitely liked it I didn't love it , Gordon has done better but this is still worth a watch .
Handsomely mounted adventure film .	The Wind and the Lion starts in Tangier in Morocco on October 15 1904 where an American woman named Eden Pedecaris ( Candice Bergen ) & her two young children Jennifer ( Polly Gottesman ) & William ( Simon Harrison ) are kidnapped by the gang of men lead by Moroccan rebel Mulay Hamid El Raisuli ( Sean Connery ) the Lord of the Rif , Sultan to the Berbers & the last of the Barbary Pirates . Word of the kidnapping gets back to President Theodore Roosevelt ( Brain Keith ) who decides to use the situation as a show of strength & issues the ultimatum ' Pedecaris alive or Raisuli dead ' . As the struggle for power in the Middle East & Morocco wages between the Europeans , the Americans & the Moroccan people Raisuli & Pedercaris become pawns , they become symbols of war & what to fight for or against as the Middle East sees in the beginning of the 20th Century in turbulent fashion . . . Written & directed by John Milius this historical adventure is loosely based on real events but in essence is a fictional work , whether you like The Wind and the Lion will probably depend on how much you enjoy period adventure films . Of course the fact that the film is partly about an American war against Middle Eastern extremist's who kidnap people & demand a ransom has parallels to what's happening right now in the real world , doesn't it ? The character's are well written & likable , it's odd to see Sean Connery play an Arab Sultan but he has great charisma & screen presence although it's rather inevitable that Pedecaris will fall for his roguish behaviour , sense of honour & conviction in his beliefs while it's also just as inevitable that Raisuli will fall for her strength , independence & good looks in the obligatory romance subplot . The film has an uneven pace & tone , it flips between Raisuli , Roosevelt in America , lots of political wrangling & some good old fashioned fighting without a totally clear direction . It's a good film but I just wish it didn't last quite as long & it didn't come to a grinding halt every five minutes for a speech of some sort , whether it's Roosevelt in America talking about Grizzly Bears or Raisuli in Morocco spouting another cryptic proverb . I mean I just think it might have flowed a bit better had it not been so bogged down in politics & philosophising . The Wind and the Lion is good film but I did get bored by it by the end , it is a little predictable & the story could have been a little bit more focused . Director Milius does a fine job here , the film looks wonderful from start to finish with exemplary production design , costumes & locations . A lot of time is spent during The Wind and the Lion setting the scene & really making the viewer feel they are watching something that did indeed take place at the start of the last century . The film can also be quite violent at times , there's plenty of death , shootings , a severed tongue , a couple of executions & some nicely choreographed action scenes . Some people seem to think the horse were abused during the making of The Wind of the Lion , the film has never been released on any home video format here in the UK because the BBFC demanded cuts to several horse falls to which director Milius reacted angrily to & stopped the planned release since all who were involved with the making of it say no animals were hurt at all . To be honest I didn't see anything that concerned me at all . With a supposed budget of about $4 , 000 , 000 The Wind and the Lion looks great throughout with top class production values & meticulous attention to detail . Set in Morocco but filmed largely in Spain . The acting is good especially Sean Connery . The Wind and the Lion is a visual treat for anyone who likes their films set in the past , it looks great throughout & there are some nice action scenes but the story doesn't hold up that well & it's far too long for my liking . Good but not great & I doubt I would want to see it again anytime soon .
" Maybe you are a bomb . . . just don't blow up in my face . " Entertaining enough Sci-Fi thriller .	Impostor is set in 2079 & starts with a narration by Spencer Olham ( co-producer Gary Sinise ) informing us that the planet Earth is now at war with a race of hostile aliens called the Centauri . There now exists a Global Government run by a Chancellor ( Lindsay Crouse ) & all our cities are protected by ' electromagnetic domes ' from Centauri air raids , Spencer also informs us that his Father was killed by the Centauri & that he has devoted his life to the fight against the alien invasion . Spencer works for the defence bureau & has helped develop a weapon which will potentially help win the war , together with his best friend Nelson Gittes ( Tony Shalhoub ) Spencer is ready to meet & present the weapon to the Chancellor . However , before he has the chance he is arrested by Major Hathaway ( Vincent D'Onofrio ) of the ESA , the Earth Security Agency . Hathaway claims that Spencer is now an impostor sent by the Centauri to assassinate the Chancellor , a flesh & blood genetic cyborg created from DNA that is perfect in every detail & has a bomb inside his heart ready to explode when the Chancellor is in range . Hathaway points out there is only one way to find out for sure & that's to surgically remove Spencer's heart & have a look , Spencer believing he is still human & that a mistake has been made doesn't like that idea much & manages to escape into the ' Dead Zone ' with Hathaway & his soldiers in hot pursuit . Spencer's wife , Maya ( Madeleine Stowe ) works as a doctor at ' Veterans Hospital ' & could possibly hold the key to proving his innocence with a special medical test she can run . Spencer teams up with Cale ( Mekhi Phifer ) to escape the Dead Zone , infiltrate the Hospital & hopefully prove he is human . But will they succeed & will Spencer like what he finds out . . . Co-produced & directed by Gary Felder I thought Impostor was an OK time waster that had more potential than what it delivered . The script by Caroline Case , Ehren Kruger & David Twohy based on the story by Philip K . Dick starts strongly with the Sci-Fi mystery elements of whether Spencer is indeed a impostor & playing around with the basic human emotion of who we can & can't trust really working well & engrossing me , but it quickly degenerates into a cheap looking Sci-Fi action film with Spencer avoiding the authorities & having the odd fight until things become interesting again with a pretty cool twist ending that you may or may not see coming , I must admit that I didn't . Most of the secondary characters aren't developed in the slightest , for example we never learn the relationship between Cale & the woman in the Hospital who he's risking his life to get medication for . Impostor has a nice look throughout with decent enough special effects , it's just a shame the action scenes are dull , lifeless , unoriginal & unexciting as a few good chases & shoot-outs would have helped no end during the slow middle section between the initial accusation & the eventual resolution . I was surprised to learn that Impostor had a budget of $40 , 000 , 000 as I'd never heard of it before I actually saw it , I presume it was a flop at the box office & didn't get much attention , certainly not here in the UK anyway . It doesn't have the look of a big budget film either , it has nice production values for sure but not outstanding . The acting is pretty good & Sinise does a fine job as a man who doesn't know if he can even trust himself . Onofrio plays the supposed villain alright even if he doesn't turn out to be such a bad guy after all . Unfortunately & somewhat strangely we never actually see what the Centurai aliens look like , how can you make an alien invasion film & not show a single alien ? Stowe as the token wife is rather flat & uninspired . Overall I thought Impostor was a decent way to spend 90 odd minutes but I also felt it could have been so much more if it had carried the paranoia & more interesting elements of the fist 20 odd minutes right through the rest of the film rather than piling on lots of dull Sci-Fi chase scenes which mean very little & are far to bland & forgettable . Worth watching for sure as it ain't a bad film by any means but maybe you could read a book during the middle third , say a Philip K . Dick story or something like that . . .
Watchable at best . Potential not fully realised .	Sometimes They Come Back . . . for More has two M . P . ' s Captain Sam Cage ( Clayton Rohner ) & Major Callie O'Grady ( Chase Masterson ) dispatched to a military base in the Antartic named Arebus , officially a research facility but in reality an illegal mining base . Their brief is that Arebus has a crew of six & one of them has gone ' postal ' , it's their job to sort things out . A helicopter drops them in & they quickly find Major Frank Whittaker ( Stephen Hart ) frozen solid in the snow outside the base , upon entering the base they find medical officer Dr . Jennifer Wills ( Faith Ford ) & technician Lieutenant Brian Shebanski ( Max Perlich ) who show them the frozen body of Lieutenant Baines ( Douglas Stoup ) & say that the remaining two members of the crew , Captain Robert Reynolds ( Michael Stadvec ) & Dr . Carl Schilling ( Damian Chapa ) are somewhere outside in the tunnels they have mined . The mystery deepens as Baines body disappears & the radio is trashed , could the puzzling events be connected to something Dr . Schilling discovered in the icy tunnels below the Antartic surface . . . Directed by Daniel Zelik Berk I thought Sometimes They Come Back . . . for More was an OK way to pass the time but ultimately disappointed . The script by Adam Grossman & Darryl Sollerh starts off really well as everything is kept as mysterious as possible , the film gradually unravels into a weak climax involving Brothers who are 1000's of years old & the resurrection of Satan which is all rather silly & doesn't sit that well with what has gone before . The character's are pretty good , the dialogue is fine , it moves along at a fair pace & the basic story manages to do a decent job of both gripping & engaging the viewer . The film obviously reminds of The Thing ( 1982 ) although that's where the comparisons stop . It kept me watching throughout but I couldn't help but think that the climax isn't worth watching the first 90 minutes for which is a shame as I thought the set-up was well executed & deserved better . One more thing , I don't think the U . S . military would send just two soldiers ( no medic either ? ) out for a rescue mission in horrendous weather & just leave them there with no radio contact except what was available at Arebus ( what if it was broken ? ) , I don't think so . . . Director Berk does an OK job here & there is some decent atmosphere & tension . The Antartic is a great place to set a horror film & makes for a harsh , cold , desolate , unforgiving & isolated location . I don't know why more horror films aren't set in either Pole , perhaps it's the technical problems associated with filming in the conditions . Forget about any blood or gore as there isn't any but the film relies more on atmosphere & story for it's effectiveness . With a budget of about $2 , 000 , 000 Sometimes They Come Back . . . for More is technically a very solid film , it's far from spectacular but since it was actually shot in Antartica , according to the IMDb , it has a definite chilly feel throughout . The acting was pretty good although I wasn't to impressed with leading man Rohner . Sometimes They Come Back . . . for More started well & showed promise but it's almost as if the filmmakers didn't know where to go with the set-up & it all ends rather lamely with a weak climax . Worth a watch but don't expect a masterpiece . The third in the Sometimes They Come Back . . . series of films this has no connection with the previous two & in fact is also known as Frozen & Ice Station Erebus & I wonder whether this was even conceived as a sequel or a stand alone film ?
Unique , surreal and often bizarre horror / fairy tale that is certainly different .	I'm not sure where to even start and describe the ' plot ' of The Company of Wolves ! But I'll try as best I can , the film begins with Rosaleen ( Sarah Patterson ) asleep , tossing and turning in bed . Most of the film is the telling of her dream . Rosaleen's dream starts with her running through a dark spooky forest . She meets a giant teddy bear and a few more of her dolls . Just forget about the story that doesn't make a blind bit of sense and enjoy the visuals . Rosaleen's dream is mostly set in a small village in the middle of a large forest . Rosaleen is attending the funeral of her sister Alice ( Georgia Slowe ) who was supposedly killed by Wolves . Rosaleen spends the night at her Grandmother's ( Angela Lansbury ) who tells her a story . The story concerns a young newly married couple ( Kathryn Pogson and Stephen Rea ) on their wedding night . He disappears into the forest and doesn't return , his wife fears him dead and remarries . One night years later he does come back , but he has changed in a horrifying way . The film then jumps back to Rosaleen in the village being chased and chatted up by a boy ( Shane Johnstone ) until we get another bizarre story about the Devil ( Terence Stamp ) turning up in a chauffeur driven car and handing out a strange potion . There is another story where a woman witch ( Dawn Archibald ) turns a load of wealthy wedding guest into Wolves . Then it's back to the village again as Rosaleen takes an eventful walk with the boy who fancies her . Towards the end of the film Rosaleen also meets up with a huntsman ( Micha Burgese ) who happens to be a Wolf . Eventually the film switches back to Rosaleen in the ' real ' world but ends up still as bizarre and surreal as what has gone on before . Co-written and directed Neil Jordan this is one bizarre and surreal film . The script by Jordan and Angela Carter based on her own short story mixes fairy tale folk lore with horror and tries to create a film around the ideas . The biggest problem I had with this film is that it just doesn't have any linear or coherent story , very few developed characters most of whom aren't even given a name and confusing dream within a dream type structure so I was at times not sure ' where ' I as a viewer was meant to be . When the film finished I didn't really know what to think except ' what just happened ? ' . On the positive side the film is absolutely gorgeous to behold . It oozes style and class . This is a real treat to sit down and watch as Jordan directs with flair and purpose . The production design by Anton Furst is sumptuous with beautiful looking sets . I love the forest with it's huge mushrooms , the graveyard and the whole village itself . I really liked the end where it was snowing and icicles were hanging from the branches as flakes of snow fell to the ground while Rosaleen was walking along in her hooded Red Riding Hood cape , a truly wonderful film to look at throughout . There are a few special effect shots , a couple of gory Werewolf transformations plus a severed hand and chopped off head , but this isn't a gore-fest . Sarah Patterson is OK as Rosaleen as is Angela Lansbury as her Grandmother , no-one else is in it for that long as they just come and go depending on where we are at that particular moment . The Comany of Wolves has great visual style but has absolutely no meaningful story to back them up . Worth watching if you want something a little different . Generally speaking I actually quite liked it , but it's definitely not a film to suit all tastes .
The beginning of the end .	Blade : The Series : Monsters starts as the bomb given to the pureblood Vampire Charlotte ( Emily Hirst ) by Chase ( Jessica Gower ) on behalf of turnblood Marcus ( Neil Jackson ) explodes in mid air on her jet , they just about survive the crash & two unlucky campers provide fresh blood . . . Krista ( Jill Wagner ) informs Blade ( Sticky Fingaz ) & his sidekick Shen ( Nelson Lee ) who with the help of ex-FBI agent Ray Collins ( Larry Poindexter ) locate the jet's wreckage , in an attempt to salvage some information Blade searches the wreck & discovers Charlotte has found her way to a nearby town . . . This was episode 11 from season 1 of the made-for-TV Blade : The Series , directed by Ken Girotti you will probably get more out of Monsters if you have prior knowledge of the series . The script by Daniel Truly is starting to wrap the series up , Marcus's plan is reaching it's final stages with his attempt to kill Charlotte , Blade is getting closer to him & other such factors . This is definitely not a good episode to jump into the series with . The action levels are pretty low during this one & it's rather talky , it's an OK watch but I doubt I'd be in any hurry to see it again . This looks pretty good considering the budget was probably low , the average fights & action scenes simply can't compare to the films & left me distinctly unmoved . Forget about any gore in this one as there isn't any . Monsters is alright but it isn't brilliant , worth a watch if your a fan but don't expect too much .
Decent making of a remake TV special .	What Have You Done ? The Remaking of ' Black Christmas ' is a 28 minute long made-for-TV documentary focusing on the making of Black Christmas ( 2006 ) & I would have thought it would have found it's way onto at least some of the various DVD releases around the world . As far as it goes this is a perfectly watchable making of documentary , it's not the greatest one I've ever seen or the most in depth but if you want to get a feel of the production , see some behind-the-scenes sequences & get the thoughts of the main cast & crew then you can't really go wrong with this . There is a fair amount of behind-the-scenes footage including an interview with a stage hand who has to make the trees sway in the wind with two ropes attached to the branches which he has to pull on ! There's also the story of how one of the girls hurt her ankle when a hatchway fell on it during the first days shooting . I also liked the comments by those involved which seemed to suggest that they weren't trying to remaking the original Black Christmas ( 1974 ) shot-for-shot as such but just making a new film based on it , if that makes sense . Unfortunately this has a couple of things against it , for a start it was made-for-TV so all the bad language is beeped out , the sequences chosen from the film are of the talky variety so as not to show any violence & because of the lack of blood there's nothing about the special effects which is sort of disappointing as the gory murders are one of the films highlights . Also another problem is that it was broadcast before Black Christmas actually hit theatres so everyone interviewed is on their best behaviour & basically big the film up as much as possible , there's plenty of he / she / they did a wonderful job type comments even though at the point they were interviewed ( actually on set during the filming ) I doubt any of them would have seen the finished film . What Have You Done ? The Remaking of ' Black Christmas ' is a fine self congratulatory promotional piece designed solely to get potential viewers into theatres , for what it is it's fine but I'd have liked to have seen something on the gory special make-up effects .
" Pain & the knife are inseparable . " Decent historic drama .	Corridors of Blood is set in ' London 1840 before the discovery of anaesthesia ' where prominent surgeon Dr . Thomas Bolton ( Boris Karloff ) is convinced that ' operations without pain ' are possible as having your leg sawn off without any anaesthesia is rather painful . Bolton feels that by experimenting with different combinations of drugs he can create a gas which will render the patient numb & not able to feel a thing as the sharp steel of the saw & knife slices through flesh . . . Not everyone is convinced about his ideas though & after a terrible demonstration which fails Bolton finds lots of resistance to his idea but he carries on with his experiments & becomes addicted to the drugs he creates , after he is forced to take a ' holiday ' & his privilege's are revoked he has to turn to local thugs to acquire the drugs he needs . . . This British production sat on the self & remain unreleased for 4 years was directed Robert Day & to be fair to it it's a pretty decent film . The first thing to say is that the inappropriate & unjustly exploitative title is very misleading & that Corridors of Blood is more a historic drama than a horror film , in fact apart from some uneasy surgery scenes there is no horror in this film . The script by Jean Scott Rogers chronicles the invention of anaesthesia in an entirely fictional story , it's a fairly interesting & watchable film but I felt it was a bit dull & not much stood out for me . It has a leisurely pace , I'm not sure whether it was conceived as a horror film & I get the impression that anyone going ' blind ' into this film on the back of it having Boris Karloff & Christopher Lee in it along with it's attention grabbing title will be disappointed . The character's are OK , the dialogue is alright although I didn't think that much of the overly sentimental ending . It's a decent enough film but that's it . Director Day does OK but it suffers from the limitations you think a black and white film of this vintage would . The sets are cosy enough , the period recreation looks good but it's all rather static & a bit bland . The couple of surgery scenes are pretty grim even though they're not graphic a it's more the thought of what's going on than what is actually seen . Forget about any scares as it's just not that sort of film , there's no exploitation either . Technically Corridors of Blood is fine , it's a reasonably well crafted film with good production values . The acting is good , Karloff puts in his usual commanding performance & a young up & coming actor named Christopher Lee makes for an effective villain in an early role . Corridors of Blood is a perfectly watchable film although I'm not really sure who it's meant to appeal to , for me I was hoping for a horror film because of the title & instead I got a fictional historic drama & frankly I'd rather had spent the time watching a horror film . Worth a watch but nothing that special .
" I will satisfy you until you beg me to stop . " Average & somewhat dull exploitation film .	Ilsa , She Wolf of the SS starts with a paragraph of text that states the events in this film are based on reality , yeah right . Afterwards the action proper begins with an unfortunate male prisoner being castrated by Ilsa ( Dyanne Thorne ) & her two guards Ingrid ( Jo Jo Deville ) & Maigret ( Sandy Richman ) . Ilsa is the Nazi Commandant of ' Camp 9 ' that is used by the Third Reich for cruel medical research . Shortly after 15 new female prisoners arrive for Ilsa & the sleazy Dr . Binz ( George ' Buck ' Flower ) to conduct their experiments on & prove her meaningless theory that specially trained women can withstand more pain then men . New inmate Anna ( Maria Marx ) is as hard as nails & refuses to break , just the sort of woman Ilsa is looking for . Anna decides she has no intention of hanging around & befriends Kata ( Nicolle Riddell ) who tells her about the male prisoners who are kept separate & that they might be able to join forces & break out . Meanwhile a German born American ( ! ) named Wolfe ( Gregory Knoph ) has amazed Ilsa with his sexual powers to withhold ejaculation ( ! ) which he intends to use to his advantage , help the escape effort & liberate the camp . . . This German American co-production was directed by Don Edmonds & was the first of four films featuring the infamous character of Ilsa although apart from her presence none are really connected to each other & it really didn't do that much for me . The script by Jonah Royston goes for all out exploitation & sleaze with virtually no regard to historic accuracy or worrying about little things like the story & character's , at least it keeps moving & never becomes dull or boring . Ilsa , She Wolf of the SS exists purely to show off plenty of naked flesh , soft-core sex & torture scenes , if this sounds fun then I guess you'll love it but I look for a little bit more depth & reasoning behind my exploitation . The torture & gore scenes aren't much to get excited about these days as they feature plenty of ( very ) fake blood but few are overly explicit , someone has her toenails pulled out , someone is forced to lie in a tub of boiling water , someone is left in a pressurisation chamber , someone has their privates operated on , people's open wounds are deliberately infected with diseases , someone has their throat cut & there are various beating's & floggings . There is also a dining scene in which a female prisoner has a noose tied around her neck & is stood upon a block of ice , as the ice melts & begins to disappear the noose gets tighter . . . There is plenty of female nudity but the sex is pretty soft , there is a gang rape & an embarrassingly lame attempt at a golden shower scene I mean just look at the expression on her face as she delivers the goods . . . With an estimated budget of about $150 , 000 Ilsa , She Wolf of the SS has surprisingly good production values although that can be contributed in no small part to it being filmed on the existing sets from the recently finished TV series Hogan's Heroes ( 1961 - 1971 ) which probably actually had a set design budget . The costumes are OK although there aren't many guards are there ? The special effects are good enough but mostly consist of fake blood , the music & cinematography are also better than one would expect from a poverty row exploitation film such as this . The acting was OK but I have to admit I really dislike Thorne , she was 42 when she made this & looks it & being in my mid-20's I found her somewhat off-putting ( & I'm being kind there so I won't mention her horrid saggy breasts ) . Not really much else to say other than if you like exploitation then this is a must watch but ultimately it didn't do that much for me . It's a decent enough way to pass 95 minutes for those with the stomach but just don't expect anything outstanding , average at best .
" Gentlemen , you are about to enter the most important and fascinating sphere of police work the world of forensic medicine . " The first we got to hear those words .	Quincy M . E . : Fight City Hall . . . To the Death ! starts as LA coroner Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) examines the dead body of Diane Johnson ( Martha Smith ) on a beach , LAPD cop Lt . Monahan ( Garry Walberg ) sees it as a open & shut case of rape & that Peter Gordon ( Rick Podell ) who was shot by some of his men while in possession of Diane's handbag is guilty . Quincy is positive Peter isn't though , trying to use scientific methods to convince Monahan fails & he decides to investigate Diane's murder himself . He starts at city hall where Diane worked but before long more dead bodies turn up & Quincy feels the answer lies in city hall itself with corrupt counsellors . . . Episode 1 from season 1 this is where it all started for Quincy , this is where we got our first glimpse of the much loved Los Angeles coroner & I have to say I didn't actually like this one that much . I first have to say I will be basing my comment on the cut down 45 minute version rather than the longer original one which is available in the DVD set , it seems the short one only gets played on TV to bring it & the other feature length episode down to the standard 45 minute duration . I must admit that if I had seen this back in ' 76 I probably wouldn't have bothered sticking with the show because this is one of the weaker murder mystery episodes . I found the way Monahan constantly dismissed Quincy's findings as stupid , sure if Quincy was going on a hunch I could understand it but Quincy presented solid medical facts especially regarding the guy who supposedly hanged himself & he would have been obliged to accept Quincy's findings . Then there's the fact Quincy , at least in this short version , isn't in the lab at all in this episode & flies off to Mexico to do some investigating & it just felt like a routine cop show rather than the interesting mystery show Quincy would become . The character's are nothing special , there's some humour here but not much & overall while it's still watchable I didn't think it ranked up there with the best Quincy stories . This one looks OK , I'm not sure about some of the fashions but it was made in ' 76 which was before I was even born . In a way it's amazing to think episodes of Quincy are still being played even now . The end features some truly awful dubbing & some of the grunt noises Quincy comes out with are pretty funny because they so obviously are dubbed , badly dubbed too . This is the episode which features the two cars falling over a cliff seen in the opening titles for the rest of the show's entire run . The acting is good & Klugman just fits into the role perfectly from the word go . Go Fight City Hall . . . To the Death ! is an OK Quincy episode , it's probably more notable for being the very first one rather than for being a particularly good story . A must if your a fan otherwise there are better stories out there .
" You you please get your dog of my foot . " Another social issue for Quincy to solve .	Quincy M . E . : Deadly Protection starts as a young girl named Emily Stapleton ( Kristin Gamboa ) is happily playing in her yard when the family's new German Shephard guard dog named Samson goes crazy & attacks her , L . A . county coroner Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) is deeply upset & moved at having to perform an autopsy on her . Quincy speaks with Emily's father Jay ( Sam Groom ) & promises him he will look into the regulations surrounding the training & selling of guard dogs before anymore innocent lives are lost to killer dogs , as he digs deeper Quincy discovers a virtually unregulated business & he uses his influence to try & warn the general public of the dangers . . . Episode 23 from season 7 ( the IMDb is wrong because it also states that Expert in Murder aired on / 82 yet lists it as episode 20 from season 6 , a season which aired in 1980 & 1981 , when it was in fact episode 20 from season 7 & Deadly Protection actually aired on / 82 which makes it episode 23 from season 7 , got that ? Good ) this Quincy story was directed by Paul Krasny & is yet another diverse story from this very adaptable & varied series , it's not the best Quincy episode ever but it's still a decent watch & a perfectly entertaining way to pass an hour . Disappointingly there isn't much of a crime here for Quincy to solve for mot of it's duration & when one does finally arise it's painfully obvious what's going on , the issue it tackles though is still very relevant & I can recall several high profile attacks here in the UK on children by vicious dogs which have left them either dead or horribly scarred although as far as I remember they were from family pets as opposed to guard dogs . It's not a pleasant subject to be honest & I didn't think it made the basis for a particularly good story , it's Quincy & I like the show even when it's not as good as usual but other's may not have the same tolerance levels . There's a cheesy comedy gag running through Deadly Protection as Quincy adopts a cute little doggy from the pound & has to hide it from his boss Asten ( John S . Ragin ) whom the dog keeps peeing on , very funny if you like that sort of thing . The acting is alright here but Sam Groom as the father who has lost his only daughter doesn't convince . Deadly Protection isn't the best Quincy episode , it focuses too much on it's moral issue & for the most part leaves Quincy on the sidelines which is never a good idea , it's a perfectly watchable story but there are better ones out there .
Half good , half bad . I'm in two minds about this one .	Know more commonly as Tombs of the Blind Dead among English speaking audiences La Noche del Terror Ciego begins in a hotel somewhere in Lisbon . Two old school friends , Betty Turner ( Lone Fleming ) & Virginia White ( Maria Elena Arpon as Helen Harp ) spot each other . Virginia introduces Betty to her friend Roger Whelan ( Cesar Burner ) and together they all decide to go camping for the weekend , nice . They all meet up and hop on a train . Virginia is uneasy about Betty coming along & her mood worsens further when Betty and Roger seem to be getting along together a little too well . Virginia spots a building in the distance and jumps off the train , leaving Betty and Roger behind . Virginia heads towards the building which turns out to be a ruined castle located near an old , abandoned and run down village called Berzano . Virginia decides to get her camping gear out and bed down for the night in a small-ish house . While listening to some terrible music on her radio zombies start to rise from their graves . The next day and Betty & Roger are concerned over Virginia's safety . They head out to Berzano and find lots of tombs and graves with Latin inscriptions , Roger helpfully knows how to read ancient Latin . He translates the writing and tells Betty that these are the " tombs of the Templar's , an ancient order that worshipped the devil in 1250 A . D . " . While at the village they also run into Inspector Oliveira ( Rufino Ingles ) who confirms that Virginia was murdered . Back in Lisbon Betty and Roger identify the body . They decide to investigate Virginia's death . First they talk with Nina ( Veronica Llimera ) who works for Betty and was brought up in a neighbouring village not far from Berzano . They also talk to an authority on the middle ages , a Professor Candal ( Francisco Sanz ) who tells them about the Templar's . Betty and Roger feel they must spend the night in Berzano , so along with a drug dealer named Pedro ( Joseph Thelman ) and his girl Maria ( Maria Silva ) for reasons that still aren't clear , they head towards Berzano and wait for the night and whatever it may bring ! This Spanish / Portuguese production was written and directed by Armando De Ossorio and is a decent enough time waster but it's not without it's problems . The biggest fault with Tombs of the Blind Dead in my opinion is that it has a terrific opening 20-25 minutes , then during the next 40 odd minutes the film introduces characters and situations that are only seen and referred to in this middle third , after this awkward looking section it's back to business and we get a great ending 20 odd minutes . Basically the entire middle third seems like padding and at odds with the Gothic zombie horror of the first and last thirds . I think the version I watched was cut , but then again there are probably various differing edits out there . The one I saw had virtually no blood or gore whatsoever , a few bites , a chopped off arm and a couple of dead bodies on a morgue table . There isn't any nudity either and during an opening lesbian flashback scene the two ladies in question keep their clothes on when it probably would have been just as easy to show naked flesh . The film has a really good atmosphere , especially the Templar's themselves who wear dirty rotting robes & brandish large broad swords , their slow motion attacks which are surprisingly effective & creepy as is when they rise from their graves and tombs . I loved the locations and the run down house set with it's cobwebs everywhere , creaking battered wooden doors and crumbling plaster & bricks . Ossorio directs with style and has created some very cool imagery , I loved the swinging light in the morgue which constantly changed the position of shadows during the sequence and how Ossorio lit the run down house with the warn glow of a flickering fire . On numerous occasions it's a pretty impressive looking film , except the obvious day-for-night sequences which there are many . On a technical note the film is generally very good , photography , editing , special effects and sets are all better than I would have expected . But when all said and done I can't get over the pointless middle section that feels like it's there to extend the running time as most of what happens during this part simply isn't necessary . So I think half of this film stands out as being a great Europeaon zombie horror while the other half is a total waste of time . Worth watching for Euro horror fans but very patchy .
" Quite a number , she keeps quiet & she's a good cook , where did you pick her up ? " Strange & pointless but I kind of liked it .	Le Notti Erotiche dei Morti Viventi , or Erotic Nights of the Living Dead & Sexy Nights of the Living Dead as it's more widely known among English speaking audiences , introduces us to John Wilson ( Mark Shannon ) who works for a company that are going to buy a tropical paradise called Cat Island & build a holiday resort on it . John hires local sailor Larry O'Hara ( George Eastman ) to take him & his wife Fiona ( Dirce Funari ) to Cat Island so he can give it the once over , despite Cat Islands bad reputation with the superstitious locals Larry agrees to take them . Once there they encounter a mysterious young woman ( Laura Gemser ) & her Grandfather who act strangely & warn them to leave . John isn't having any of it & since the boats motor has broken down their stuck there anyway . Things take a turn for the worse when it becomes apparent that Cat Island is also infested with rotting flesh-eating zombies whom appear very hungry . . . This Italian production was directed by Joe D'Amato who also saw to the cinematography under his real name Aristide Massaccesi & there really aren't many films like Le Notti Erotiche dei Morti Viventi around , this has been released in basically two different versions an explicit one with hardcore sex & a softer one without although I think both versions contain all the gore . The script by star George Eastman mixes hardcore pornography & Italian exploitation horror . I'm not sure that the mixing of these two genres work particularly well as both the horror & sex elements are kept well apart in terms of the story & one has no notable significance in regards to the other which at times can make you feel that Le Notti Erotiche dei Morti Viventi is two different films pasted together . The hardcore footage consists of one scene where two prostitutes have sex with John , masturbation ( at this point while giving John a hand-job one of the women says " they could arrest you for carrying a concealed weapon ! " ) , oral sex & full penetration are present but that's where the hardcore ends really , there is a scene when Fiona masturbates & an infamous bit when a women opens a bottle by inserting it into her vagina . The horror doesn't really kick in until the last 20 or so minutes when the zombies rise . The pacing is a real killer as far as the overall film goes , it becomes quite boring towards the end & at almost 2 hours long in it's uncut state I found my interest waining well before the end . There are very few characters in Le Notti Erotiche dei Morti Viventi & those present aren't that well fleshed out , a lot of scenes & ideas seem unrelated & go unexplained like the Doctor who gets one scene , the black cat that keeps turning up , the zombie in the port that Larry kills , the man at the beginning killed by a zombie & why the hell are there zombies on Cat Island anyway ? Some sort of explanation would have been nice while the opening & closing segments are completely unnecessary & feel out of place . On a positive note director D'Amato amazingly manages to create some good sequences , the blue lit zombie scenes at the end look fantastic & add a visual elegance . I wouldn't give D'Amato too much credit though as these scenes were shot during the day & a blue sepia tone was probably added in post production with the alternate sunny daytime shots as they were filmed presented on the DVD as an extra . The real life Santa Domingo locations in the Dominican Republic look beautiful , the beaches , the clear blue sea & the palm trees make me wish I was there zombies or not ! The gore is not that graphic , a couple of zombies have their heads chopped off , a few are shot in the head , there is one brief gut-munching scene , a Doctor is attacked by a maggot ridden zombie & that's about it . There is lots of nudity , in fact everyone take all their clothes off for the slightest reason except Eastman who never strips below the waist in any part . The acting & dubbing are up to the usual low standards set by Euro exploitation films . Le Notti Erotiche dei Morti Viventi is an odd film , I liked it's exploitation elements but found it very choppy , poorly paced & despite the odd explicit sex scene & brief horror I didn't find it particularly enjoyable or entertaining as a whole , just in parts which is where my score comes from . Still it's definitely worth a watch for Euro exploitation fans like myself who should be able to find a few redeeming features in it . However , if you get hold of the uncut version make sure you don't watch it in front of your family . . .
" He doesn't need a wife , he needs a bank he can bonk . " Dream Demon had potential but ultimately disappoints .	Dream Demon starts at a wedding as the Minister ( Richard Warner ) ask's the bride Diana Markham ( Jemma Redgrave ) to take her vows but she hesitates & declines so the groom Oliver Hall ( Mark Greenstreet ) slaps her across the face , Diana ain't going to take that sort of thing so slaps him back which makes his head fly off his body & fountains of blood spurt everywhere . Diana suddenly wakes up , it was just a horrible nightmare . Diana is in reality engaged to Falklands War hero Oliver & their wedding becomes a big story with two local scumbag reporters Paul Lawrence ( Jimmy Nail ) & Russell Peck ( Timothy Spall ) who constantly hassle her for a story & try to dig a bit of dirt up if you know what I mean . One day Diana befriends an American teenager named Jenny Hoffman ( Kathleen Wilhoite ) who claims she can't remember anything about her childhood but then confusingly says she remembers growing up in the house in which Diana now lives having just moved in a mere 2 weeks ago . Diana continues to have terrifying nightmares , a doll that a large maggot crawls out off , the basement turning into a labyrinth of dark corridors , a split in the wall appearing & starting to pour with blood & both Paul & Russell turn up horribly disfigured taunting her . Jenny also starts to experience Diana's nightmares , but in reality while Diana sleeps . Diana starts to lose her grip on reality as her nightmares take over , is it all in Diana's imagination ? Is the sudden appearance of Jenny a mere coincidence ? Is the house somehow involved ? Is there a purpose to these gruesome nightmares ? You will have to watch it to find out . . . This British produced film was co-written & directed by Harley Cokeliss & while I thought Dream Demon had potential it ultimately disappoints . The script by Cokeliss & Christopher Wicking is at fault here , basically it's one big unexplained mess . Even now I simply don't know what really happened & I finished watching it mere hours ago , where do the two newspaper journalists come into it ? What were their purpose & why do they just walk off at the end discussing fast food ? Why does not one single person die during the entire film ? Where's the horror & threat ? Why does Jenny not remember anything about her childhood but specifically remembers the exact house she grew up in in London ? I mean London is a pretty big place you know & considering she can't remember anything else . . . What were the meaning & purpose of these nightmares ? I know it recounts the house's past but why ? Nothing is put right , nothing is avenged , nothing is resolved & at the end nothing has changed from when Dream Demon started . One final baffling question , does anyone else think Kathleen Wilhoite looks like a man ? That jaw line , that nose & her face in general screams transvestite ! On the positive side director Cokeliss manages to create some terrific sequences , I absolutely love that wedding scene at the beginning ! The scenes that feature the disfigured Paul & Russell are pretty creepy especially a scene in a lift , I don't know what they did to Jimmy Nail to make him look the way he did but he gave me the creeps big time ! It moves along at a nice pace but for the first hour or so it's just Diana having a nightmare , waking up & telling people about it & then having another nightmare , waking up again & telling people that she's had another one , & so this pattern continues for over an hour & I found it started to become dull as I wanted some sort of explanation of what was going on . The slightest hint of a story would have helped , there are also various plot threads that are left unexplored like the possible child abuse suffered by Jenny , the Angel symbolism , the two-timing fiancé & Diana's virginity & marital fears . There are some impressive gore effects too , the aforementioned decapitation at the wedding , a fist punched through someones head & some gory make-up effects plastered on Spall including him having his ear pulled off . It's just a shame there wasn't more of them & that ultimately they were all only dreams & everyone in the film survives . With a modest budget of about £3 , 000 , 000 Dream Demon has nice production design & is well made with a certain class & the late 80's London setting makes it feel a little different . The acting is surprisingly strong throughout except Kathleen Wilhoite , now I have nothing against her but she does look like a bloke & she is both terrible & annoying in her role , urgh . Well what can I say to sum up ? There is no dream demon that the title refers to , it has a very loose poorly thought out story which is confusing & when all said & done Dream Demon disappointed & in no way could be described as the British A Nightmare on Elm Street ( 1984 ) . It's unusual & has some great ideas & individual scenes but isn't something that I could recommend to the casual film-goer , however die-hard horror fans would probably get something out of it but just don't expect too much .
A mixed horror anthology , average at best .	A Rolls-Royce pulls up outside some large metal gates . A sign on a wall next to the gates says ' H . M . Prison Commission , Department of Psychiatric Medicine . Prof . R . C . Tremayne , MD Phd BSc ' , basically it's an asylum and Tremayne is in charge . Once past the gates and inside the building Dr . Nicholas ( Jack Hawkins ) congratulates his friend Dr . Tremayne ( Donald Pleasence ) on his breakthrough . They walk around the asylum and visit four patients who each have a story revolve around them . First up it's a young boy named Paul ( Russell Lewis ) in a segment called ' Mr . Tiger ' . Paul's parents Faye ( Georgia Brown ) and Sam Patterson ( Donald Houston ) are always arguing . Paul's tutor Phillipe ( David Wood ) tells Faye about Paul's imaginary friend named ' Mr . Tiger ' who is unsurprisingly a tiger . Obviously everyone thinks Paul is making it up . That is until Faye finds claw marks on a door . . . . . . . . . . . . Nicholas and Tremayne then visit Timothy Patrick ( Peter McEnery ) , which leads us into the second story called ' Penny Farthing ' . Timothy's Aunt has recently died and left him a lot of antiques for his shop which he runs with his wife Ann ( Suzy Kendall ) . Included with the items are a photograph of Timothy's stiff-upper lipped Uncle Albert ( Frank Forsyth ) and a penny farthing . While working late one night Timothy becomes possessed by Albert who makes him get on the penny farthing and start to peddle . This takes Timothy to another time and place , but for what possible reason . . . . . . . . . ? Next up it's Brian ( Micheal Jayston ) and a short story called ' Mel ' . While out running one day Brian finds a strangely and interestingly shaped log . He drags it home as he thinks he can ' do something with it ' . Much to the displeasure of his girlfriend Bella ( Joan Collins ) . Brian becomes obsessed with it . But there seems to be something odd about the log , it's almost as if it were alive . Eventually Bella decides either the log goes or she does , with unexpected results . . . . . . . Finally it's Auriol Pageant ( Kim Novak ) and her segment is called ' Luau ' . Auriol is expecting an important client , an author named Kimo ( Micheal Petrovitch ) and his assistant Keoki ( Leon Lissek ) to fly into the country . Auriol decides she has to show him a good time and impress . First of all she takes Kimo and Keoki out to dinner , along with Auriol's daughter Virginia ( Mary Tamm ) . Kimo then starts to take an unhealthy interest in Virginia's personal life . Meanwhile Auriol is planning on having an Hawaiian party as a surprise for Kimo , and the centrepiece being a large pork roast . However , it soon becomes clear that Kimo and Keoki have their own ideas as to what type of meat should be served . . . . . . . . . . Back at the asylum there is one final horrifying twist before the end credits roll . Directed by Freddie Francis I thought this was an average anthology and the individual stories themselves are a mixed bag to say the least . One of the problems is the script by Jennifer Jayne as Jay Fairbank . With an anthology film like this the segments need to be short and have a memorable twist at the end , in this case only the story called ' Mel ' does . Mr . Tiger is very predictable , as soon as the word tiger is mentioned you know exactly what's going to happen in the end and it's not a surprise when it does . Penny farthing is just plain surreal and bizarre , there is no real explanation as to why Uncle Albert is possessing Timothy , it's merely hinted at . This story also has a very weak ending , I was sitting there waiting for a twist or a startling plot revelation but neither came and it just sort of ended limply . Mel with Joan Collins is easily the best story and tries to have a nice twist at the end , and as a whole the story itself works well as a short and is entertaining to watch Joan battle it out with a tree stump for the affections of Brian . The final story is also really predictable as it starts with Kimo promising to preform a voodoo ritual with a human sacrifice , he turns up at Auriol's house and takes an interest in her daughter Virginia . It doesn't take a rocket scientist to work out what's going to happen does it ? It's generally well made as you would expect of British horror from the 70's . There is no blood or gore in it and only a couple of brief scenes of nudity , one of which involves Joan Collins , but the camera never shows her face while her characters breasts are out . They probably used a body double . Acting is OK from everyone involved . Overall I didn't think too much of it , it's OK but not as good as many other horror anthologies like the House that Drpped Blood ( 1970 ) , Asylum ( 1972 ) , the Vault of Horror ( 1973 ) or even Creepshow ( 1982 ) . Probably worth a watch if you can catch it on T . V . but not much else .
" Your out of bullets & you know what that means . . . your sht out of luck . " Solid 80's tough cop thriller .	The Dead Pool is set in San Francisco where crime-boss Lou Janero ( Anthony Charnota ) has put a hit out on Inspector ' Dirty ' Harry Callahan ( Clint Eastwood ) , while dodging attempts on his life & with his new partner Inspector Quan ( Evan C . Kim ) Harry has to investigate the death of rock star Johnny Squares ( Jim Carrey ) when he is discovered dead in his trailer on the set of a horror film . With help from a local new reporter Samantha Walker ( Patricia Clarkson ) Harry discovers the existence of a dead pool , a list of celebrities which horror film director Peter Swan ( Liam Neeson ) & some of his friends bet on who will die before a certain date . It quickly transpires that someone is systematically going through Peter's list & killing the celebrities off one-by-one & Harry learns that his name is on the list which makes him a potential victim . . . Directed by Buddy Van Horn this was the fifth & to date final Dirty Harry film , I haven't seen all of them as yet but I thought The Dead Pool was a pretty good if unspectacular 80's tough cop thriller . The script by Steve Sharon is alright , it has a fairly good story that tries something different for the genre although one has to say I felt it had more potential than it ultimately delivered . The idea of a dead pool lottery style bet about celebrities dying could have made for a great film but here the idea is underdeveloped , it's never revealed what the point of the dead pool is in the first place . I mean it's seemingly nothing more than a silly bet between a horror director & a few of his friends , it's never revealed what the actual prize was meant to be or just how seriously those involved took it & it gets forgotten as the number of murder victims grow . What I'm trying to say is that I never felt there was sufficient reason behind the killings & the climax which reveals it was the work of a lone psychotic was somewhat underwhelming . The Dead Pool also tries to say something relevant about media coverage of crimes & cops , this is quite well handled & the point is made effectively enough . The makers could have had a lot of fun with the dead pool & turned this into a gripping thriller , as it is it's a decent action thriller that passes the time but ultimately doesn't live long in the memory once it's over . Director Van Horn does alright , it moves along at a decent pace , there's some good action scenes & shoot-outs along with an imaginative car chase in which Dirty Harry is chased across San Francisco by a remote controlled car packed with explosives ! Harry himself is still a great character & he has everything it took to be an action hero back in the 80's , the utter & total contempt for authority , the droll one-liners & the need to use excessive & deadly force at all times which he also had during the 70's of course . He has it all , he's maybe a bit old but he still holds his own as he blows bad guy's away left , right & center . There's some violence & a bit of blood which helps things along nicely . Technically the film is good , it has that solid Hollywood big budget feel to it & it's well made especially the car chase . Shot on location in San Francisco despite , according to the IMDb , the cities residents ( people with obviously too much time on their hands ) protesting that ' Dirty ' Harry Callahan would be a bad character to represent the city ! The acting is OK , there are early roles for Liam Neeson & Jim Carrey while the members of Guns N'Roses appear as extras at the funeral of Johnny Squares . The Dead Pool is a solid action thriller , it's not the best one ever made but it's far from the worst . Dirty Harry fans should like it & general action fans should too , worth a watch if nothing else . This was a sequel to Dirty Harry ( 1971 ) , Magnum Force ( 1973 ) , The Enforcer ( 1976 ) & Sudden Impact ( 1983 ) .
Decent 90's action flick .	Air Force One starts in Russia three months after General Ivan Radek ( Jürgen Prochnow ) the self proclaimed military leader of Kashakstan has been captured by American & Russian forces , the president of the United States James Marshall ( Harrison Ford ) & the Russian president Petrov ( Alan Woolf ) speak to the worlds media & affirm their tough stance on terrorism & terrorists . Afterwards Marshall & his people head back to his plane Air Force One & take off . Shortly into the flight General Radek loyalist & terrorist Ivan Korshunov ( Gary Oldman ) & his men hijack Air Force One & take complete control of it , Marshall makes it down to the baggage compartment & the escape pod which he ejects . Korshunov thinks he has lost the president but Marshall is still on board & is determined to save his family , the other passengers & not give in to Korshunov or his demands . . . This American German co-production was co-produced & directed by Wolfgang Petersen & while it's not up there in the higher echelons of the big budget action film genre alongside the likes of Die Hard ( 1988 ) , Terminator 2 : Judgment Day ( 1991 ) or Speed ( 1994 ) for instance it's an entertaining enough big budget action spectacle with which to pass a couple of hours . The script by Andrew W . Marlowe really rams home the all American hero plot with the president of the United States turning into an action star as he single handedly takes on a bunch of terrorists , it's all very patriotic & a bit sentimental as it tries to makes all you Americans out there feel a little bit better about your foreign policies & stance on terrorism . Air Force One repeatedly states that America & it's stance is right & everyone else is wrong . However take away some of the more questionable political aspects of Air Force One & we are left we a action packed thriller with a familiar hijacking plot but plenty of fights , shoot-outs , explosions & action to pass a couple of hours with the minimum of fuss . The character's are your usual cardboard cut-outs & clichés , the dialogue is functional & the pace does drag at times but if you like big budget Hollywood action flicks then I am sure you will like Air Force One . Director Petersen does alright , there are maybe a couple of plot holes like how did known terrorist Korshunov & his men get through the fingerprint security check at the start ? There's some stuff about inside help but it's never really explained to any satisfactory degree & then there's setting all those explosives off on the plane which in reality would be a really bad idea . Then there's the secret service traitor , why does he just stand by while the terrorists plans go down the toilet ? Why does he not try to rectify them ? Why remain anonymous ? It just seems weird that he would stand by & let all the plans that he was involved with go to waste , I just don't really get it . The action scenes are well handled but a little repetitive . There's a fair amount of violence & blood splatter . The final plane to plane mid air rescue is apparently an almost shot-for-shot copy of the same type of rescue in Airport 1975 ( 1974 ) . With a supposed budget of about $85 , 000 , 000 Air Force One is well made with big budget Hollywood production values , some of the CGI computer effects look a little dated these days but they still suffice . The lead role was originally written for Kevin Costner but he did The Postman ( 1997 ) instead , big mistake Kevin big mistake . The acting is good , Harrison Ford makes for a decent all American hero , British actor Gary Oldman playing a Russian terrorist turned down the bad guy role in Speed 2 : Cruise Control ( 1997 ) to do this ( good choice ) & makes for a good villain while the likes of Glenn Close , Dean Stockwell , William H . Macy & Tom Everett having supporting roles . Air Force One ( if they ever made a sequel would they call it Air Force One Two ? ) is a entertaining if ultimately somewhat shallow big budget action film set aboard a plane , to be honest I think Con Air ( 1997 ) is still the best hijacked plane action flick out there but this isn't too far behind .
" You look good enough to eat . " I liked it .	Masters of Horror : The Washingtonians starts as Mike ( co-writer Jonathon Schaech ) & Pam Franks ( Venus Terzo ) along with their 10 year old daughter Amy ( Julia Tortolano ) drive to the house left to Frank by his recently deceased Grandmother , once there they start to explore their new home . Amy decides to look in the basement & discovers a large painting of George Washington the founder of the United States , upon closer inspection Mike finds a letter & a fork made of bone behind a tear in the canvas . The letter talks of Washington engaging in cannibalistic activities , Mike realises that if the letter turns out to be genuine then it could rewrite American history but so do a group of loons called Washingtonians who will do anything to get the letter back . . . This Canadian American co-production was episode 12 from season 2 of the generally hit-and-miss Masters of Horror TV series , directed by Peter Medak I actually thought The Washingtonians was a definite hit & I rather liked this darkly comic story despite it's largely negative reviews . The tongue-in-cheek script by Richard Chizmar & star Jonathon Schaech was based on a short story of the same name by Bentley Little & has a cool twisted central premise , the thought of George Washington being a cannibal & there being people who call themselves Washingtonians who still carry on the tradition is an interesting & perverse idea that I thought made for a very watchable & entertaining 60 odd minutes . However it's far from perfect , the tight time scale means it feels a bit rushed no more so than the frustrating ending because the episode was going really well as far as I was concerned & then all of a sudden everything just seemed to end abruptly without a satisfactory conclusion which is the only real criticism I have with The Washingtonians & I deify anyone to say The Washingtonians is a worse Masters of Horror episode than The Screwfly Solution with a straight face . Director Medak is yet another strange choice to direct a so-called Masters of Horror episode , apart from The Changeling ( 1981 ) , a Tales from the Crypt episode called The New Arrival ( 1992 ) & Species II ( 1998 ) he hasn't exactly been prolific within the horror genre has he ? He does fine here , there's not many scares but at least he keeps things moving & there's a nice atmosphere to this one especially the cool juxtaposition at the end when amidst all the splendour & opulence of The Washingtonians posh surroundings they indulge in very vulgar acts of cannibalism . As usual there's some top gore , there's a decapitation at the start & the expected various cannibal scenes including someone eating chunks of flesh from a severed foot , a huge tray with a chopped up body on it , there's intestine eating & plenty of blood splashed around . Techncially these Masters of Horror episodes are very well made & don't look like the cheap made-for-TV show's that they are in reality . The special effects are excellent as always & it has high production values . The acting was alright but the 10 year girl annoyed like a lot of child actors do . The Washingtonians seems to have a bad reputation which frankly I couldn't give a toss about because I liked it & that's all that matters to me & it's as simple & straight forward as that , I reckon it's well worth an hour of your life .
" Let's give him a piece of his own medicine . " You have to see it to believe it , outrageously entertaining horror or confused rubbish ?	Horror Hospital starts with a black Rolls Royce parked in some woods somewhere in England . Dr . Storm ( Micheal Gough ) cracks his knuckles as he waits in the back with his assistant , a dwarf named Frederick ( Skip Martin ) . A teenage couple are seen running through the woods covered in bloodied bandages , the Roller pulls up behind the escaping duo & a couple of sharp blades shoot out of the side of the car & as it catches the fleeing patients up & drives past the blades decapitate them both & their heads are caught in sacks also attached to the side of the Roller , this is a fantastic sequence by the way ! Jason Jones ( Robin Askwith ) decides to leave the ' Mystic ' rock group after they stole one of his songs & a fight broke out . Jason notices an advert for ' Hairy Holidays ' & feels the time is right for a break so he wanders down an alleyway in London ( NOT a good thing to do . . . ) where the Hairy Holidays office's are located & meets Mr . Pollack ( Dennis Price ) the gay owner . After a brief sales pitch Jason decides to go to Brittlehurst Manor , a relaxing health resort . On the train Jason meets Judy Peters ( Venessa Shaw ) who is also on her way to Brittlehurst Manor to meet her Aunt Harris ( Ellen Pollack ) for the first time . But once there what they find is beyond their wildest ( drug induced ) dreams ! The insane wheelchair bound Dr . Storm & his wife Aunt Harris , zombified teenagers , murder , a strange abused dwarf servant , biker helmet wearing guards , blood stained sheets that look as if someone has been slaughtering cattle on them , axe's hanging on the walls , water that runs red with blood & only one available room which they have to share . It soon becomes clear to both Jason & Judy that Dr . Storm has some unusual methods of treatment . . . This English exploitation / horror film was co-written & directed by Antony Blach who also has an uncredited cameo in the film as a bearded man in the club , I thought Horror Hospital was a bizarre film that feels like it has everything but the kitchen sink , they don't , won't or can't make ' em like this any more ! The script by Blach & Alan Watson is a real mess , there's guards dressed as bikers for some reason , a Rolls Royce which decapitates people , zombified back flipping teenagers , dwarfs , a deadly bog in the middle of an English wood , a deformed monster who likes to whip naked girls , brain operations , flashbacks , gay holiday salesmen , a rock group with a thieving transvestite lead singer , a weird train station attendant , severed heads in a water tank , a shower scene involving someone wearing a Knight's steel helmet & a real overriding sense of bizarreness throughout . In fact sometimes it feels like too much is happening , Dr . Storm's motives are never made clear & as a whole Horror Hospital is all over the place even though it has some great ideas it doesn't quite know what to do with them as it tries to stuff as much into it's 88 minutes as possible . This , as it happens , is a good thing though as it moves along like a rocket , is never dull or boring & is just so entertaining to watch if you take it in the right way . Horror Hospital is not set in any sort of Hospital I recognise , it was obviously shot in a stately house somewhere that has a basement lab for Dr . Storm next to the basement gym . After a fantastic opening sequence Horror Hospital loses it's way more & more as it progresses , it becomes more confused & feels more padded as it reaches it's predictably bizarre ending . At least Blach & his crew tried to make something a bit different & they certainly succeeded . Horror Hospital is one of those unique films I could probably talk about all day analysing it & pointing to various scenes that stay in the memory . A lot of Horror Hospital is very tongue-in-cheek & for the most part it thankfully doesn't seem to take itself too seriously . It's also very camp & garish , it's a real product of the early 70's , just check out Askwith's hairdo & clothes ! Horror Hospital contains little in the way of blood or gore , the brain operation is off screen for the most part but that wonderful decapitating Roller provides some severed heads & gore when it pops up . Gough is good as the mad scientist but everyone else is rather undistinguished in their roles . Technically Horror Hospital is basic & a bit crude at times but more than acceptable & it gives the film yet another bizarre extra dimension . Overall I had tremendous fun with Horror Hospital but if your looking for a serious scary horror film then forget it , watch a Hammer Dracula or Frankenstein if you want serious British horror . Still with me ? In that case make sure you check this out if just for laughs only of which there are many , definitely a unique viewing experience & a film everyone should see at least once . . .
Entertaining horror anthology that's good fun .	Tales from the Darkside : The Movie starts with an ordinary looking woman named Betty ( Deborah Harry ) driving home , once there it is revealed that she is keeping a young boy named Timmy ( Matthew Lawrence ) locked in a cage in her kitchen & intends to kill , cook & eat him . To try & stall for time Timmy offers to read some stories from a book called ' Tales from the Darkside ' , Betty reveals that they have plenty of time & tells him to go ahead . Timmy's first story is called ' Lot 249 ' . . . Andy ( Christian Slater ) & Lee ( Robert Sedgwick ) are university students & best friends . They discover another student named Edward Bellingham ( Steve Buscemi ) has won an auction for ' Lot 249 ' which happens to be an Egyptian sarcophagus with it's Mummy still inside . Edward finds an ancient scroll stuffed inside the Mummy which when recited is able to bring the Mummy back to life . . . Betty liked ' Lot 247 ' so lets Timmy tell another one , this time called ' Cat from Hell ' . . . A hit-man named Halsten ( David Johansen ) arrives at the large mansion owned by the billionaire owner of a pharmaceuticals company named Drogan ( William Hickey ) who offers to pay Halsten $100 , 000 to kill a mysterious black cat which he believes has been sent to kill him . Drogan thinks the cat has already killed three people & thinks he is next . Halsten thinks Drogan is crazy but accepts nevertheless , however he soon discovers that killing this particular cat isn't as easy as it first would appear . . . Betty also liked ' Cat from Hell ' & says that Timmy can tell one more story , Timmy chooses ' Lover's Vow ' . . . Preston ( James Remar ) is a failed New York artist whose apartment is overlooked by a stone Gargoyle . One night after he is told by his agent Wyatt ( Robert Klein ) that he is being dumped Preston gets so drunk the bartender Jer ( Ashton Wise ) has to take him home . While walking down some back alleyway Jer is decapitated by a large creature with wings & sharp claws , the creature goes up to Preston & says that it will spare his life if he never tells anyone about it . Not having much choice Preston agrees & the creature disappears in the New York night . Shortly after this unnerving encounter Preston meets & falls in love with a woman named Carola ( Rae Dawn Chong ) whom after being together for 10 years have two children , Margaret ( Nicole Leach ) & John ( Daniel Harrison ) but Preston is finding it harder to keep his secret but surely after all this time it wouldn't matter if he told his wife , would it . . . ? Betty now decides enough is enough , there will be no more stories & it's time for Timmy to become dinner . . . Directed by John Harrison who also composed the score for the ' Lover's Vow ' Segment , I thought Tales from the Darkside : The Movie was a good horror anthology that isn't the best this sub-genre has to offer but it is by no means the worst either . I like anthology films & I look for quick fast paced stories with a nice twist at they're end . Unfortunately Tales from the Darkside : The Movie didn't quite manage to surprise me with two of it's twists which were actually pretty obvious while the story that has the strongest ending is the slowest to sit through . ' Lot 247 ' was written by Micheal McDowell based on a story by Sherlock Holmes creator Sir Arthur Conan Doyle & is a good opening story featuring the familiar faces of Christian Slater , Steve Buscemi & Julianne Moore but I found the ending of this segment weak & predictable which spoilt what had gone on before . The second story ' Cat from Hell ' written by George A . Romero based on a short story by Stephen King ( his name just had to be here somewhere didn't it ? ) is the weakest of the three stories but is the most stylishly filmed with some cool fades & transitions between shots , blue tinted flashbacks & the spacious , spooky darkly lit mansion provides some real atmosphere which is wasted on this segment as it's ending didn't do anything for me as it turned out exactly as I expected with the cat appearing to succeed in it's quest for revenge . The third story written by Micheal McDowall is generally considered the best & for good reason , although it's slower than the previous two it has impact & a good ending twist which I didn't actually see coming . I'm not saying the other two stories are bad , far from it but I was maybe hoping for a few more surprises . I won't bother commenting on the wraparound story as I found it very poor . The film as whole moves along nicely & since each story only runs 20 odd minutes none of them outstay their welcome . It's well made throughout with nice production values especially during the ' Cat from Hell ' segment which looks very nice . The acting is good too with some familiar faces . One thing Tales from the Darkside : The Movie does have going for it are some wonderful special make-up effects by K . N . B effects with Dick Smith credited as a consultant . Each story seems to have it's own little special effects showpiece , ' Lot 249 ' has the Mummy being chopped up with an electric carving knife , ' Cat from Hell ' has a cat bloodily enter someones body through their mouth & then exit the same way & ' Lover's Vow ' has the excellent & totally cool looking Gargoyle transformation & just about any shot that it's in really . It's a little light on the actual blood & gore front though , we do get a gorily realistic cool looking severed hand & decapitation . Overall I liked Tales from the Darkside : The Movie but I can't help but feel the endings of both ' Lot 247 ' & ' Cat from Hell ' let those segments down somewhat . Still the film as a whole is a great watch & is good all round entertainment .
Great little discussed thriller .	Shoot to Kill starts late one night in San Francisco as diamond merchant Mr . Berger ( Milton Selzer ) sets the alarm off in his jewellery shop & the police show up , still in his pyjama's with a couple of pounds of diamonds it's clear that he's being forced to act against his will & when questioned by special FBI agent Warren Stantin ( Sidney Poitier ) he admits that an armed man has his wife as a hostage . The local police & Stantin try to negotiate the release of Mrs . Berger ( Janet Rotblatt ) but the plan only ends up getting her killed & the killer escaping with the diamonds . The next day & the killer is trying to cross the border into Canada through a small town called Bishop Falls but is spooked when he sees a large police presence & decides to kill a member of a hiking group & take his place so he can cross the border on foot . Meanwhile Stantin learns of the man's death which was in the same unique manner Mrs . Berger was killed & sets off after his man through the tricky & rough mountainous terrain . . . Directed by Roger Spottiswoode & known under the better title of Deadly Pursuit here in the UK I thought this was a great action thriller which doesn't often get mentioned . The script by Harv Zimmel , Michael Burton & Daniel Petrie Jr . takes itself pretty seriously although there are one or two light hearted moments surrounding agent Stantin's ' fish out of water ' type situation even if the scene where he confronts a Grizzly Bear & scares it off by flapping his arms in the air is a little too silly . The film moves along at a nice pace & mixes the genres of thriller , action & whodunit very effectively . The character's are good & I liked the way that despite working together agent Stantin & his guide didn't suddenly become the best of friends & have long deep , meaningful conversations about their lives as in say Lethal Weapon ( 1987 ) because that's just so clichéd . In fact there isn't that much dialogue spoken in the film & poor Kirstie Alley barely says a word ! Shoot to Kill starts off as a whodunit mystery but about half way through it reveals the killer & it changes in tone & becomes a taught thriller & I actually rather liked this abrupt & unexpected change in direction it took . A good solid throughly entertaining thriller with a decent cast that's worth a look but won't have much replay value as once you know the killer the films twist won't have any impact & the entire first half will lose it's effectiveness . Director Spottiswoode does a good job here , the isolated forest locations are well used & the film has a nice tension to it especially during it's first half when we don't know who the killer is . There are some good action scenes including chases , a car chase , some shoot outs & people hanging over cliffs on rope although when John hits that cliff face the force & impact would have broken just about every bone in his body . The violence & body count are relatively low as is the profanity but that makes a nice chance . Technically the film is fine with nice location shooting , it was shot largely in Canada with the opening sequence shot in San Fransico . It's well made & I would have imagined it had a decent budget coming from the Disney owned Touchstone Pictures . The acting is good & there's a pretty impressive cast here . Shoot to Kill , I much prefer the title Deadly Pursuit , is a neat little action thriller with a good concept that's not predictable has unusual relationships between the character's & is well worth a watch .
Solid British made supernatural horror film from Amicus	The soon to be married to Charles Fengriffen ( Ian Ogilvy ) Catherine ( Stephanie Beacham ) is travelling by horse drawn carriage to the Fengriffin's ancestral mansion located deep in the English countryside , along with her Aunt Edith ( Gillian Lind ) . During this pre-credit opening sequence Beacham provides an ominous voice over narration , she says " in my dreams I go back to the year 1795 , to a time when I was happy . I was on my way to be married , I was going to the house in which I was to find my days filled with fear , my nights filled with horror . " Once there she is met by Charles . She becomes interested in the Fengriffen family portraits that line the staircase and landing . Charles tells her about them and who each one is . She is drawn towards one in particular , that of Charles Great Grandfather Sir Henry Fengriffen ( Herbert Lom ) . The painting seems to have an eerie presence about it . On their wedding night Charles and Catherine head straight for the bedroom . Once Charles leaves Catherine alone in the bedroom to go and change his clothes the door shuts behind him and locks itself . Catherine is attacked , a mans hand is placed over her mouth . Once free Catherine screams her head off , Charles finding the door locked breaks it down with an axe and finds Catherine terrified and talking about being attacked by ghosts with only one hand , and just a stump where it's other hand should be . No one believes her , soon after it is confirmed that she is pregnant . More and more strange occurrences happen , paintings seem to come to life , hands burst through paintings trying to grab Catherine , a severed hand keeps turning up , a local woodsman Silas ( Geoffrey Whitehead ) keeps hanging around Charles and Catherine and people connected with the couple start to die in mysterious circumstances including their Doctor , Dr . Whittle ( Patrick Magee ) and their Lawyer , Maitland ( Guy Rolfe ) . Charles sends for a specialist from London , Dr . Pope ( Peter Cushing ) . Catherine starts to learn that she isn't being told the whole truth and that the strange things that are happening to her may be the result of a curse , is Catherine mad ? Or is there more going on than her husband Charles is willing to admit ? Will Dr . Pope get to the bottom of it ? Directed by Roy Ward Baker for Amicus studio's I really liked this . It's a fine film all round , it has a great atmosphere and feel to it . Good solid if unspectacular photography and it's nicely acted by all involved even if Beacham overacts on a couple of occasions , but her good looks and ample cleavage makes up for that ! Production design is good with the location and detailed sets looking impressive , costumes look a bit silly at times but I guess that's how people dressed in the 18th century ! There's no real violence or gore in it , a reasonably well done severed hand and a zombie ghost without any eyes is about as explicit as it gets . No frontal nudity either , but there is a rape scene . The script by Roger Marshall from the novel Fengriffen by David Case is a little slow in places but it kept my interest throughout , and it all comes together rather nicely at the end . The appropriately booming orchestral score by Douglas Gamely is also worthy of a mention . I enjoyed And Now the Screaming Starts ! ( I like that title as well ) a lot , if you like Hammer films than definitely check this one out , if not give it a watch anyway you might like it . Recommended , a solid period set horror that I really enjoyed .
Really surprised at how much I liked it .	House of Wax starts as six friends head towards a big football game in Los Angeles , they decide to take the scenic route & camp out for the night . The next morning & one of the cars has a snapped fan belt & ain't going nowhere , a weird local ( David Herriman ) boy / girlfriend Wade ( Jared Padalecki ) & Carly ( Elisha Cuthbert ) a ride into a nearby town called Ambrose to get a new fan belt from the local gas station while their friends continue on the journey . The center point of Ambrose seems to be the eye-catching House of Wax museum but Wade & Carly are there for a fan belt & not to look at wax exhibits . As day turns to night they realise that Ambrose isn't the quiet sleepy town it first appeared , it hides a dark & shocking secret that Wade & Carly soon discover . . . This Australian American co-production was the directorial debut of Jaume Collet-Serra & I am proud to admit that I enjoyed House of Wax far , far more than I expected & it's actually become a bit of a favourite of mine now . Produced by Dark Castle Entertainment that was set up by some big Hollywood names & who specialise in audience pleasing better than you would expect horror fare such as House on Haunted Hill ( 1999 ) , Thir13en Ghosts ( 2001 ) , Ghost Ship ( 2002 ) , Gothika ( 2003 ) & more recently The Reaping ( 2007 ) , much like House on Haunted Hill , Thir13en Ghosts & Ghost Ship House of Wax is actually a remake of House of Wax ( 1953 ) with Vincent Price ( the main bad guy in this remake is named Vincent as a homage ) which itself was a remake of Mystery of the Wax Museum ( 1933 ) so House of Wax is in fact a remake of a remake . Having said that while there are one or two broad similarities between the films this House of Wax is more of a re-imagining than a straight remake & the makers have devised a different central plot , in fact this modern House of Wax probably has more in common with the backwoods brutality flicks like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre ( 1974 ) rather than a romantic horror since the script has a couple of vicious psycho killers rather than a love struck Vincent Price . I have to say that I am amazed at how much I enjoyed House of Wax , I thought it was a great film that I rate quite highly . There's some wonderful ideas & scenes here , I absolutely love the idea of a literal house of wax in the sense it's made from wax & I thought the fiery climax where it literally melts around the character's & has them treading through oozing hot wax was inspired . I have never seen anything like it before & thought it was a grand concept that worked perfectly within such a visual medium as film & the makers have done the idea proud . There's some really cool gore scenes & while it takes a little while to get going I was never bored by it which is always a good sign . Sure the teen character's are a little clichéd , hollow & their decision making isn't always the best , there really isn't much of an explanation or much in the way of motivation behind the gory goings-on but it's great fun , it works surprisingly well , it's good entertainment that really delivers what it sets out to & is a hugely enjoyable way to pass 100 odd minutes . Besides a really fun story with one or two decent twists House of Wax looks great , the wax museum & the town has a cool 30's art deco styled look & feel about it that I liked , it's a very stylish & good looking film . Vincent's chamber of horrors with pipes , grill flooring & wax drips everywhere has a really nice orange hue to it & it certainly has an ominous feel about it . There's some top gore here as well , from peeled off skin to a huge pit full of dead mutilated roadkill , from gory stabbings to clipped off fingers , from decapitations to the show-stopping scene where someone gets a huge metal pipe stuck through their head & they slide down it ! Interestingly Vincent actually films this on a camcorder , maybe the director is saying that we the audience are just as bad as he is since we are also voyeur's for watching & enjoying it . Then again maybe I'm reading too much into it ! Director Serra actually manages to generate a fair amount of tension & suspense during the last half of the film culminating in the spectacular & exciting climax . There are many memorable scenes here too beside the gory ones , from the sinister town full of wax statues to Carly having her mouth super-glued shut to Wade having hot wax poured onto him . With a supposed budget of about $30 , 000 , 000 this opened to reasonable box-office business & ended up turning a profit I would have thought , although set in the US it was filmed entirely in Australia . The special effects crew actually burnt down an entire sound stage while testing some equipment , apparently a candle caused the fire & the entire studio was destroyed . The acting is alright , the stand out name is ' it ' celebrity Paris Hilton who strips to her underwear & gets a great death scene . House of Wax was much , much better than I was expecting & it's actually a bit of a favourite of mine now , I liked it a lot . There are many impressive scenes , some great gore , good production values & stylish sets & even a little suspense as well . Good stuff .
Despite it's bad reputation I actually rather enjoyed it .	King Kong starts in ' Surbabaya Indonesia ' in a port where the ' Petrox Explorer ' is about to set sail for a previously uncharted island recently photographed by a satellite orbiting the Earth , the photo's revealed that there is a possibility that the island is a rich source of oil & Petrox executive Fred S . Wilson ( Charles Grodin ) wants to get his hands on it before his competitors . Just before the ship sets sail paleontologist Jack Prescot ( Jeff Bridges ) sneaks aboard in hope of studying the islands untouched wildlife . As they head for the island they discover a raft floating in the open sea & pick up has been actress Dawn ( Jessica Lange ) . Once on the island the initial landing party discover a primitive tribe who fear & worship a god they call Kong & they want to offer the pretty Dawn as a sacrifice , an idea which no-one is that keen about . That night back aboard the ship some natives kidnap Dawn , take her back to the island , chain her up & leave her for Kong who turns out to be a 40 foot Gorilla . Kong takes a shine to Dawn & carries her off , a rescue party is already on the island & they must set out to try & save Dawn from Kong & whatever other horrors the island holds . . . Directed by John Guillermin I actually had a fair amount of fun with this usually hated remake of the original 1933 classic . The script by Lorenzo Semple Jr . moves like an absolute rocket & at least is never dull or boring but at the same time it's rather camp & silly . Would a 40 foot Gorilla really be able to avoid detection in Manhattan by simply hiding behind a skyscraper ? Would a 40 foot Gorilla be able to ' sneak ' up on someone ? What are the chances of a small raft being found in the middle of the ocean ? The odds must be astronomical ! A fog bank that remains totally unchanged for 100's of years ? Wouldn't the wind not affect it at all ? It sticks to the originals basic story except that all the monsters & dinosaurs are gone & have been replaced by a rubber snake that looks like one of those draft excluder's that you place at the bottom of doors . This is one aspect of the original that is sorely missed in this remake . The character's are over-the-top but quite likable , Wilson as the annoying Petrox executive irritates though . I liked it as a piece of harmless entertaining fun although it can't really compare to the original . Director Guillermin does an OK job , apparently Roman Polanski , Michael Winner & Sam Peckinpah were offered the chance to direct but turned it down , all I can say is I'd have loved to see what Michael Winner would have come up with ! Now the special effects , well apparently Carlo Rambaldi built a 40 foot full sized mechanical Kong at a cost of $1 . 7 million but has about a minute of screen time & it looks awful so Guillermin went with Rick Baker in a monkey suit & the results variable to say the least . Each Kink Kong film had to work within limitations & are a product of they're time , the original has stop motion animation that won't impress many these days , this one has a man in a rubber suit & the recent remake has the nicest CGI effects you can get . With a healthy budget of about $25 , 000 , 000 King Kong is well made & has that Hollywood polish to it although I'm not sure it deserved two Oscar nominations , the Hawaiian locations are nice & the climax atop the World Trade Center has a strange feeling to it . The acting is OK but nothing spectacular . I know a lot of people dislike this remake , personally I'm judging it on it's own as I feel it's a completely separate film from the original or Peter Jacksons big budget remake . If you prefer the original to this than fine watch that , & I have to say now I'm a huge fan of it , as no-one is forcing you to watch or like this . Good fun & provides a couple of hours of entertainment & thats all I want in a film .
" No we're not going to put anything in the holes , if we did that they wouldn't holes anymore . " Surprisingly really entertaining & pretty funny .	Hey , Stop Stabbing Me ! starts as Herman Schumacher ( co-writer & co-producer Patrick Casey ) graduates from St . Olaf College with a major in World History , he hitches a lift to the town of Bloomington where he has to find a place to stay . He spots a flier for a spare room , he heads on over to the address & talks to the owner of the house Blaine ( N . David Prestwood ) who says he can have the room . Herman meets the other house-mates , Damon ( Andy ' Hippa ' Kriss ) , Alan ( Sean Hall ) & Icky ( editor , co-writer , co-producer & director Worm Miller ) all of whom seem a little on the eccentric side to say the least . Herman notices that his room is still full of someone else's things , he asks Blaine who says that the room used to belong to Thaddeus who mysteriously disappeared a few months back . Herman gets a job & discovers that his major only qualifies him to dig holes in a field , Alan bizarrely changes his name to Chartreuse , he notices that in the back garden there are pieces of wood stuck in the ground with lots of previous roommates names on them , something starts to steal his clothes & he discovers that his girlfriend Cassie ( Maria A . morales ) is only 12 years old . Life in the ' real world ' isn't going as Herman expected & he also starts to believe that one of his roommates is a serial killer who buries the bodies in the back garden . . . Edited , co-written , co-produced & directed Worm Miller Hey , Stop Stabbing Me ! has absolutely no right whatsoever to a good film but against all the odds & defying all my instincts & expectations it is . The script is a madcap , crazy collection of bizarre incidents , quirky likable character's & genuinely funny gags . Even though the title may lead you to believe that Hey , Stop Stabbing Me ! is a comedy horror there is very little horror in it , it definitely doesn't play like a horror film . I really liked this film & I found it very funny , the style of comedy in Hey , Stop Stabbing Me ! is an acquired taste for sure . It's a sort of silly juvenile humour that worked very well , for instance when Blaine caught Herman using his comb & then Blaine kept reminding him of it & threatening him . The way Alan changes his name to Chartreuse & everyone else just accepts it like it's a normal thing to do apart from Herman . Or the scenes when Herman was working , even though he has a major he just digs a hole in a field & the company demands that he wears a tie to do it ! The fact that Cassie is an underage nymphomaniac , Herman's gay boss , a guy who gives Herman a lift & then keeps talking about killing hitchhikers & faking a stroke behind the wheel & there's even a creature that likes to steal Herman's clothes . I've probably made it sound crap & really stupid but I found it a very watchable , very funny & imaginative film that I'm glad I spent the time to watch . The story is minimal but it's clever & well thought out , everything comes together & works in context . This is a really good film that deserves to be seen , I can't think of anything bad to say about it other than it's extremely silly & odd & many may not like that approach . Director Miller works wonders with the budget he had , apparently Hey , Stop Stabbing Me ! had a budget of about $500 ! Jesus Christ , for $500 they worked miracles . While not particularly outstanding in any area it's pretty well made , the locations are good & I must admit that I have seen far cheaper looking films than this . What the filmmakers obviously lacked in money & facilities they make up for it in enthusiasm & energy , I bet this was a fun production to work on . There's are one or two murders in it , someone is run over with a lawnmower but as a whole the special effects consist of nothing more than a bit of fake blood . With that budget of a measly $500 don't expect state of the art special effects , exotic locations , explosions or fancy camera work but for what it is it's well put together . I even thought the music was pretty good . The actors in Hey , Stop Stabbing Me ! were obviously friends & family so don't expect great acting but it's OK , at least all of the character's are likable & pretty funny so they must be doing something right . Hey , Stop Stabbing Me ! was a big surprise to me , when I go into these shot-on-video low budget films I really don't expect much at all but this one really delivered . It's not for everyone but I recommend Hey , Stop Stabbing Me ! to anyone looking for something a bit different . Don't forget to watch the end credits as they contain outtakes & bloopers which seem to confirm that it must have been fun working on this .
I actually quite liked this one . . .	Hands of the Ripper starts in Victorian London at Berner Street Whitechappel where the infamous serial killer Jack the Ripper has struck again , as the Rippers young child named Anna watches on she witnesses the brutal murder of her Mother by her Father after she discovers that he is the Ripper . . . Jump forward several years later & Anna ( Angharad Rees ) is now a beautiful teenage girl who has been adopted by fake spiritualist Mrs . Golding ( Dora Bryan ) , one night after a organised séance Mrs . Golding accepts money from a minister named Dysart ( Derek Godfrey ) who wants to have underage sex with her . To try & calm her down Dysart gives her a necklace which gleams in the light , unfortunately this bright light brings back the memory of her Father murdering her Mother & she becomes possessed by her Father's spirit at which point she kills Mrs . Golding . Outside a respected scientist named Dr . John Pritchard ( Eric Porter ) hears the screams & rushes to investigate , he discovers Mrs . Goldings body & realise Anna must have been responsible but instead of turning her over to the police he takes her in in an attempt to discover the motivations behind a murderer & to try & ' cure ' her . However , Anna can't stop killing as her Father continues to possess her under the right circumstances . . . This English production was directed by Peter Sasdy & was presumably an attempt by Hammer studios to try something different from it's well know Dracula & Frankenstein series of films , personally I really liked it for what it was even though I know it's not that well known or thought of that highly which is a shame . The script by L . W . Davidson was based on a short printed story by Edward Spencer Shew & seems to take itself very seriously which I thought it just about got away with , the basic concept is rather far fetched & silly but I thought it worked quite well & was something a bit different even if it unfolds in a slightly predictable & linear way . Some of the character's are a bit underdeveloped & some of them are a bit dull but that's probably how people behaved in Victorian London . The film moves along at a nice pace & is never boring plus it has a nice ending which seemed very fitting . The only thing which didn't really work for me was that it didn't take much for Anna to go into here trance & be possessed & since it was so easy why had it never happened before ? Oh & I personally wouldn't let a person who had just slit my maids throat in cold blood walk around my house & do whatever she wanted especially while my family was there ! Director Sasdy does a nice job , I personally love these period horror films & Hammer did ' em as well as anyone . I love the Victorian setting , the sets , the costumes which display plenty of cleavage , the mannerisms , the horse drawn carriage's , the dialogue & decor , Hands of the Ripper is dripping with atmosphere & it looks great throughout . There's some decent gore in Hands of the Ripper too , someone is impaled with a poker , people are stabbed with swords & hat pins , there's more blood than in the usual Hammer film from the period & a great scene when Anna slits someone's throat & sticks the knife in there as well for good measure . Technically Hands of the Ripper is good , it's well made with nice production values , photography & music . The acting was very good by all involved & I actually think it helps the film that none of the Hammer regulars were used like Christopher Lee or Peter Cushing . Hands of the Ripper is one of Hammers lesser known , lesser liked films I believe . Well , that's nonsense because it's a fine film that I enjoyed watching on various levels . In my humble opinion Hands of the Ripper is one of Hammers better films , definitely worth watching especially if you like horror or Hammer .
" The dead don't walk around except in very bad paperback novels . " A highly enjoyable zombie film .	Non si Deve Profanare il Sonno dei Morti , or the more common titles of Let Sleeping Corpses Lie & The Living Dead at the Manchester Morgue among others , starts with George ( Ray Lovelock ) closing his antiques shop in London for the weekend & setting off on his motorbike for the peace , clean air & tranquillity of Windermere . On his way he stops for petrol & a half asleep woman named Edna ( Christina Galbo as Christine Galbo ) accidentally backs her mini into his bike ( bloody women drivers ! ) . Since George now has no transport he invites himself along with Edna who is travelling to a small village called Southgate to visit her drug addict of a sister named Katie ( Jeannine Mestre ) which means George is going there as well . George & Edna become lost & stop at a farm to ask directions , George finds the owner with two men from the ' Agricultural Department Experimental Section ' testing a new device which emits ultra-sonic radiation which destroys insects & parasites . Meanwhile back at the mini Edna is attacked by a tramp named Guthrie ( Fernando Hilbeck ) but manages to escape , Goerge calms her down & says he probably meant no harm & they continue their journey . At Katie's house her Husband Martin ( Jose Lifante as Jose Ruiz Lifante ) is attacked & killed by Guthrie just as George & Edna arrive , the police lead by a no nonsense Sergeant ( Arthur Kennedy ) are called & think that the three are in it together . While in a shop Edna asks about Guthrie & the shop keeper shows them a photo in the local paper , the strange thing is the picture is of Guthrie's corpse that had recently been found in a river . Edna is positive that it was Guthrie that attacked her & killed Martin , George decides that the only way to rid Edna of her ridiculous fantasies is to take her to see Guthrie's body at the local cemetery but they are shocked & horrified at what they actually discover . . . This Spanish production was filmed on location in England & studio's in Spain & Italy by a mixed Italian & Spanish crew & it's perhaps surprising that Non si Deve Profanare il Sonno dei Morti turned out as well as it did . Directed by Jorge Grau I thought this was a pretty good zombie film . The script by Juan Cobos , Sandro Continenza , Marcello Coscia & Miguel Rubio is a little slow in parts & takes it's time to get going & their lack of the local geography is painfully obvious at times especially to an Englishman like myself , listen if you break down in the Lakedistrict in England you definitely do not have to get spares delivered from Glasgow in Scotland ( even in the early 70's ) ! Forget about hordes of flesh eating zombies wandering the English countryside because it doesn't happen , there are only six zombies throughout , they are of the George A . Romero's Night of the Living Dead ( 1968 ) school of zombies & shuffle along slowly looking for tasty human intestines to eat & it wouldn't surprise me to learn that Non si Deve Profanare il Sonno dei Morti was planned as a quick European cash-in on Romero's film . I'm guessing they were trying to make a horror film which has a message as Non si Deve Profanare il Sonno dei Morti piles on the ecological catastrophe symbolism throughout from the opening shots of a dirty polluted London complete with smoking industrial chimney stacks & dead birds lying on the side of the road to the contamination of the countryside & the use of unnatural pesticides & radiation , for the most part it isn't too distracting & works in the films favour generally speaking as it gives it just that bit more depth & meaning than usual . The character of the Sergeant verges on hilarious at times with some of the things he comes out with like " button up man your wearing a uniform not a pair of pyjamas " or the classic much quoted lines " you're all the same the lot of you with your long hair & faggot clothes " & " I wish the dead could come back to life you bastard , so then I could kill you again . " The funky dialogue doesn't stop there either for example the farmer tells George " it runs like a charm laddy , it's killed every bloody insect round here except for you " while trying to defend his machine . The whole film is packed with lines like these & all the better for it I say , great stuff . The film possesses a good atmosphere & there are some really good sequences in this , Edna & George being trapped in a churches crypt surrounded by zombies is one that springs to mind . Luckily Non si Deve Profanare il Sonno dei Morti & it's script doesn't forget about the stuff we really want to see , zombies & gore ! This contains some cool early gore scenes including evisceration & intestine eating , graphic shots of burning corpses , an axe in someone's head , stabbings , an unfortunate receptionist ( Isobel Mastres ) having her breast torn off & some surprisingly good looking zombies . Technically the film is basic , almost crude at times but it's professional enough & helps to give it that unmistakable Euro-horror look & feel . The music , photography , special effects , direction & overall production values are solid throughout . On the down side the climax didn't sit well with me as it sort of went against what the film had previously put in place just to accommodate a twist ending which in my opinion wasn't needed anyway & a lot of the characters are a little stereotypical & stupid . I liked Non si Deve Profanare il Sonno dei Morti a lot & recommend it to all Euro horror fans , zombie fans & anyone interested in the horror genre in general , just be prepared to put the effort in & you should be rewarded with a fine film . Good solid early 70's zombie-filled entertainment !
Vile , sick , disturbed & a single minded in it's purpose to shock & disgust , I quite liked it .	Za Ginipiggu 2 Chiniku no Hana , or more commonly known to English speaking audiences as Guinea Pig : Flowers of Flesh and Blood , starts with some scrolling text that states in April 1985 a Japanese cartoonist named Hideshi Hibino received a parcel from an ' enthusiastic ' fan containing some 8mm film & a few still photo's that appear to show the brutal execution of a woman , it then states that what follows is a reconstruction ( therefore definitely not real ) of what the film & photo's depict . . . A young Japanese woman has just left a subway station when a car starts to follow her , at this point she becomes scared & runs but doesn't get very far in her red high heeled shoes & the man from the car catches her in a park & knocks her out using a chloroform soaked cloth . When she awakes the woman finds herself tied to a bed in the middle of a small room whose walls appear to be covered in blood stains & splatters , at this point she is probably seriously frightened . The man who abducted her now has a rubber apron on & a Samurai helmet , he picks a chicken up from a nearby cage & says ' look ! This is your fate ' he then slices the chickens head off with a curved blade , at this point she is probably bricking herself & with good reason as he then proceeds to dope her up with drugs & take great pleasure in dismembering her body piece by piece . . . This Japanese production was written & directed by Hideshi Hino & was the second film in the ' Guinea Pig ' series . First of all I have to say that Za Ginipiggu 2 : Chiniku no Hana is as fake as they come , not one part of this film is real including the decapitation of the chicken & it clearly states in the opening text that it is a reconstruction , a reconstruction of true events I don't know but definitely a reconstruction . Basically this is a splatter film that strips away any character's , events or story & just lays on the blood , violence , gore & rubber limbs for it's 40 odd minute duration . A woman is kidnapped & then brutally hacked to pieces by some nut-case dressed in a rubber apron & Samurai helmet , that's the entire film period . So let's take a look at what matters , the gore & sick stuff . Well I have to admit I'm pretty impressed with the special make-up effects as they convince & are really quite difficult to watch at times . From cutting off hands to slicing off legs & from pulling a load of intestines out of a cut opened stomach to a decapitation with an axe & let's not forget scooping an eyeball out of it's socket with a spoon & a macabre sick maggot ridden art gallery where he shows off his handy work . There is plenty of blood , maggots & disgusting stuff to keep even the most jaded gore-hound happy . The only real scary bit is when the woman is still alive ( & in one piece ) & the Samurai walks over to a table full of knives , tools , hammers , chisels , scissors & blades as you feel a certain amount of tension & anticipation at what lies ahead for the next half an hour . The human body part art gallery at the end also has a certain gross atmosphere to it , if you can make it that far . Za Ginipiggu 2 : Chiniku no Hana was obviously shot on a low budget on video , technically it has the production values of a cheap TV soap opera but those very impressive special effects belie their poverty row origins . The music & the over-the-top sound effects become annoying very quickly . Za Ginipiggu 2 : Chiniku no Hana is a strange film as I'm not really sure as to who it was made for , the entire film really is just a Japanese woman being graphically dismembered . For what it's worth I actually quite enjoyed watching it although I'm not too sure what that says about me . If Za Ginipiggu 2 : Chiniku no Hana sounds like the kind of film you may enjoy then you probably will , if it doesn't than I can guarantee you that you won't . A must for those who enjoy extreme cinema & gore .
The cut down 45 minutes version .	Quincy M . E . : A Star is Dead starts late one night as LA coroner Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) is rudely interrupted on his boat by his lab assistant Sam ( Robert Ito ) who says that famous Hollywwod actress Roberta Rhodes ( Donna Mills ) has been found dead at her home , the county want their best man on the case so Quincy gets the job . At first sight Roberta's death looks like a suicide , a simple case of barbiturate overdose but there are a few unanswered questions . The next morning & Roberta's mother ( June Lockhart ) accuses congressman Charles Sinclair ( Robert Foxworth ) of her daughter's murder , Quincy knows Sinclair personally & happens to be a close friend & is convinced he is innocent . However Lt . Monahan ( Garry Walberg ) files charges of murder & it's up to Quincy to discover the truth & clear a friends name . . . Episode 3 from season 1 this Quincy story was directed by Noel Black & is another top episode from a top series . At this point I should say I will be basing my comments on the edited 45 minute version rather than the full feature length version which ran 75 minutes & is the one found on the DVD set currently available , I assume the shorter version was made to bring it into line with the more standard Quincy episodes when it got it's own series proper . Anyway , this is a good solid Quincy mystery which is different from the average murder mystery as this time Quincy is fighting to prove a death isn't murder for a change , he doesn't get to use his medical knowledge that much in this episode & comes across more like a lawyer as he fights his case in court . I'm not sure what was cut out of this shorter version but some scenes definitely look choppy & the story moves along at a somewhat erratic pace , I mean you can't really cut 30 minutes of material out of a film & expect it to have no impact . This is a good episode mainly because of the story because there's a lack of humour in this one & feels a bit routine in other areas like if your going to edit a tape recording why leave the original where it can be so easily found ? I still liked it though . Like any TV show from the late 70's this looks somewhat dated but it's not too bad considering . It's reasonably well made but there does seem to be a lot of dubbing going on in this one which means the soundtrack is quite jarring at times . The acting is alright although Klugman steals every scene he's in . the final impassioned speech at the end is pure gold & I reckon he could make Mother Teresa feel guilty if he wanted ! A Star is Dead is a good solid mystery for Quincy to solve & is a good episode , I think the shorter edit probably suffers from the huge cuts more than some of the other edited 90 minute episodes but it seems it's only the annoying TV channel over here in the UK which plays them .
Great Quincy episode .	Quincy M . E . : Dark Angel starts as two LAPD cops Tommy Bates ( Neville Brand ) & Ed Waters ( Michael D . Roberts ) are enjoying some lunch in an alleyway , suddenly their cop car is rammed by another car driven by two teens Steve ( Michael Horton ) & Billy ( Richard Stanley ) . High on PCP Billy attacks the two officers , in a struggle Billy is wrestled to the ground & never gets back up again since he dies . Lt . Monahan ( Garry Walberg ) calls in Los Angeles chief medical examiner Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) to perform the autopsy & conduct the investigation as officer Bates is a good friend , Steve claims that the two cops beat them & deliberately killed Billy which they deny . Quincy's finding will be crucial to the outcome , unfortunately he can find nothing to back up the police officers stories . . . Episode 17 from season 4 this Quincy story was directed by Ray Danton & is a very enjoyable murder mystery with a hint of social commentary as well thrown in there for good measure . At first all the evidence points to the two officers being guilty & since they are the police everyone is quick to assume they did it , including Quincy but I guess this episodes message is not taking people at face value or by stereotype . You know , keeping an open mind & searching for the truth which is what Quincy is all about . The kid turns out to be a lying killer yet all the press wanted was a scandal involving bad cops , one might say that is still very much the case even today . If that wasn't enough Dark Angel also has a stab at warning the audience about PCP although one can say you could insert practically any other addictive personality changing drug into the story like heroin or cannabis . In fact unusually Dark Angel ends during a police training session where Monahan lectures his fellow cops about the dangers of PCP & drugs in a very school teacher preachy type way just to hammer home the message to the audience a bit more . Along with the commendable social & moral issues raised in Dark Angel there's a good solid entertaining murder mystery here as well as Quincy has to search for the truth using his medical knowledge & skills . A really good well balanced episode that I liked a lot . Here in Dark Angel we get a rare ( maybe unique ) opportunity to go inside Lt . Monahan's house & see his wife Patty ! I don't think we have ever seen her before or indeed since . The acting is good here & veteran actor Neville Brand has a small role , during a scene set inside Monahan's living room they are both watching a cop show on telly & they comment on how they don't make them like they used to & refer specifically to The Untouchables ( 1959 - 1963 ) in which Brand appeared . Dark Angel is a top Quincy episode that manages to balance the moral & social issues with a good old fashioned murder mystery in a convenient fifty minute duration , what more do you want exactly ?
" My God Quincy you were right . . . it was murder . " Quality classic Quincy episode .	Quincy M . E . : Murder by S . O . P . starts late one night as Los Angeles chief medical examiner Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) is driving his way through the small town of Millner to a forensic pathologist's convention in Sacremento , trying to keep himself awake he sticks his head outside his car window . Millner town Sheriff Ned Evers ( John Ireland ) stops Quincy & for his own benefit tells him to get some sleep in his jail , Quincy has no choice & could do with some sleep anyway . While sleeping someone stabs fellow prisoner Charlie Clements & then sets fire to the prison cell bedding to try & cover the murder up . Quincy manages to survive but in total four inmates died , working with the local doctor Carl Jessup ( Duncan Gamble ) Quincy realises that Charlie was killed & the fire started deliberately to cover it up . Sensing a cover up & coming up against a lot of resistance Quincy is determined to get to the truth & find a killer . . . Episode 11 from season 5 this Quincy story was directed by Paul Kransy & one has to say that Murder by S . O . P . is a terrific murder mystery themed episode , my favourite kind of Quincy episode in fact . Murder by S . O . P . takes place almost entirely in Millner town & therefore there are no laboratory scenes which makes for a nice change of location . The plot here in surprisingly deep as well , there are double crosses , bluffs , murders , twists & Quincy is both used & taken for a fool which is never a good thing to do if your some sort of criminal trying to get away with a murder . Murder by S . O . P . also has a social message to go with it's whodunit plot , a fair amount of the fifty minute duration is spent on highlighting how inadequate & under staffed the facilities are in small rural areas , that many murders may go undetected purely because of inadequate training , a lack of time to do the proper tests & out of date equipment small town coroners & doctors have to work with . Of course Quincy loves a moral crusade so he's right on the case & bugging a Congressman straight away ! Murder by S . O . P . is a solid whodunit with a clever ending revealing how the killer did it , I didn't see it coming anyway & thought it was quite original . I also think the ' My God Quincy you were right , it was murder ' line was a little in joke at the show's reputation , or at least I like to think so . There seems to be a recurring theme of getting Quincy out of the traditional Los Angeles laboratory setting , so far during season five Quincy has travelled to the nation of San Cristos in By the Death of a Child ( 1979 ) , Las Vegas in Hot Ice ( 1979 ) & Pine Ridge County in The Money Plague ( 1979 ) while you can add Millner town to the list with Murder by S . O . P . . With no laboratory scenes at all Sam gets a week off ! The episode is well made as usual , there's a neat car crash towards the end as a car is forced off the edge of a cliff . There is also the hilarious scene at the end when Quincy turns bad guy . To get some information out of someone he puts on a knuckle duster , raises his shoulders , knocks over some salt shakers , punches his own palm a few times & then threatens to beat the guy up ! A great scene that's very funny & lightens the tone of the episode . The acting is good as usual with veteran actor John Ireland putting in a good performance . Murder by S . O . P . , in case you don't know & are interested I think S . O . P . stands for Standard Operating Procedure , is another top quality whodunit Quincy episode that has a nice change of scenery . Fans should love it .
" This meal is so low calorie you'll be hungry before you've finished it . " A crime free Quincy .	Quincy M . E . : Sugar and Spice starts as fashion model Gretchen Stone ( Lori Street ) collapses & dies of a heart attack under the hot lights during a shoot , L . A . coroner Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) is on the case but can find no logical reason why Gretchen would suddenly die of a heart attack . Upon talking with Gretchen's sister Penny ( Lisa Jane Persky ) Quincy discovers Gretchen was on a new sort of diet & he becomes convinced that the diet along with drugs she was using caused Gretchen's heart attack . By a strange coincidence Quincy is scheduled to appear on a TV talk show to discuss the safety of plastic surgery but Corinne O'Connor ( Kathleen Nolan ) the inventor of the diet which killed Gretchen is also due to appear on the show & when they both meet they argue & Quincy accuses her diet of being a killer on national TV which gets him into lots of trouble . . . Episode 17 from season 6 this Quincy story was directed Georg Fenady & is one of those Quincy stories which has a central moral issue which revolves a tragedy that Quincy is investigating , in fact there is no crime element in Sugar and Spice at all but don't let that put you off . From a personal point of view even though I love the series I don't normally like these episodes which focus almost entirely on a social or moral issues as I prefer a good murder mystery but I thought this one was pretty good , it's not overly subtle & it's a touch predictable but it gets it's worthwhile message about dieting across effectively enough & the fact that the show does tackle these issues & can vary from murder mysteries to something completely different yet still retain it's entertainment value is one of the reasons why I like Quincy so much . Then there's the fact you get to see Quincy act like a bull in a china shop which is always great fun as Klugman does such a fantastic job of playing him & he gets to make his obligatory passionate speech of which there's at least a couple here . There's a guy in this who plays a photographer & he must have one of the worst ginger handlebar moustaches I've ever seen ! This episode keeps moving at a decent pace , it has some nice humour & Dr . Asten gets a slightly bigger role than normal . The guest cast do OK here , there is no crime in this one so neither Lt . Monahan & Sgt Brill feature until the closing ' feel good ' scene at Danny's at the end . Sugar and Spice is yet another top Quincy episode , I love the series & I could watch Klugman all day long so maybe I'm biased but what the hell I reckon this show is definitely worth watching .
" There's something wrong about Max's death & Quincy's trying to nail it down . " Decent episode .	Quincy M . E . : The Final Gift starts as two old Korean war buddies of Quincy ( Jack Klugman ) who co-own ' California Air ' a small plane business take off on a business flight . On route the plane develops a problem & they are forced to crash land , Max Carson ( Tom Troupe ) is badly cut & needs medical help . Luckily a local man named Pete ( James Whitworth ) saw the plane crash & offers assistance to Max & his partner Charlie Barnes ( Joseph Campanella ) . Pete drives them to the local doctor where Max is given an emergency transfusion of Charlie's blood . Later at Hospital & Max suddenly & mysterious dies , Quincy says he will do the autopsy himself & finds that Max died from arsenic poisoning . Suspecting foul play Quincy sets out to discover the truth . . . Episode 20 from season 5 this Quincy story was directed by Georg Fenady & is a pretty fun fifty odd minutes that fans of the show should like . The plot here in The Final Gift is quite good although I wish the makers hadn't made what was going on so bleedin obvious , every time Charlie is given a cup of coffee there's a great big close-up on the mug just so we know that he is being given lots of coffee that is laced with arsenic . A bit of subtlety might have been nice , the plot is still solid though & it will probably keep you guessing until the end , hell I'd have put my mortgage on that secretary having something to do with it . As usual it is proved that knowing Los Angeles coroner Quincy can be very bad for your health as yet another one of his friends / acquaintances dies , the guy is just a jinx . At fifty odd minutes The Final Gift moves along at a good pace & there's a nice irony in the ending as the killer only ended up killing themself & if the killer hadn't tried to kill his victim they wouldn't be dead . The budget here couldn't stretch to the plane crash so it happens off screen , I would have thought it would have been too dangerous to do in reality anyway . Joseph Campanella makes the second of his four guest appearances on Quincy playing different character's in all of them while Edward Grover makes the fifth appearance of his eight on the show . The acting is pretty good all round with Klugman again shining as usual . The Final Gift is a good solid Quincy murder mystery , while it's nothing that original it's a fun episode fans of the show should enjoy as well as armchair detectives everywhere .
" The Butler's did it . " Humorous Quincy episode .	Quincy M . E . : The Last of Leadbottom starts as Qunicy ( Jack Klugman ) , Sam ( Robert Ito ) & Asten ( John S . Ragin ) are attending the grand opening of a Naval museum named after Quincy's commanding officer during the Korean war , Rear Admiral Burgess S . McKenzie ( Albert Paulsen ) . However shortly after breaking the traditional bottle of champagne to christen the opening McKenzie collapses & dies , Quincy insists on doing the autopsy himself & is perplexed to find a small computer chip in his stomach . As lots of official looking people come out of the woodwork in search of the mysterious chip Quincy's suspicion's are raised that maybe McKenzie was murdered because of it & when McKenzie is accused of selling Naval secrets to the Russians he becomes convinced of it . . . Episode 22 from season 7 this Quincy story was written & directed by Michael Braverman is a pretty fun episode . A lot of season 7 so far has been weighed down with heavy handed social & moral issues but as the season draws to a close the last few have been purely crime driven stories & The Last of Leadbottom is no exception , here Quincy has to solve a murder , becomes involved in Naval espionage & save himself as a lot of dangerous people want the computer chip . One reason I like this episode is that it has a fair amount of humour in it , there are some amusing one-liners here & the final closing joke about ' the Butler's did it ' is actually quite funny in a cheesy sort of way . We learn a little about Quincy's past & his time in the Navy & if your interested in such things he turns out in full uniform on a few occasions . At only an hour or so in length it moves along at a nice enough pace & the while the plot feels a bit rushed at the end with lots of double crossers & false identity's being revealed in a short space of time which felt a bit confusing it's another fine mystery for Quincy fans . There's not much to say about this episode except that if your wondering about the strange sounding title it refers to Admiral McKenzie's boat he used to captain . The recognisable Tom Atkins makes a guest appearance here & does alright . The Last of Leadbottom is a fun Quincy episode with a surprising amount of humour that is actually quite amusing but it also has a neat murder mystery as well , definitely well worth a watch if you want to pass an hour .
I thought it was really funny actually .	Scary Movie 4 starts as Cindy Campbell ( Anna Farris ) gets a job as a live-in health-carer to an old woman named Mrs . Norris ( Cloris Leachman ) in a Japanese styled house . Once moved in Cindy begins seeing ghosts , meanwhile bachelor Tom Ryan ( Craig Bierko ) moves in next door . While talking one day alien invaders attack the Earth & start killing millions of people with laser beams , one of the ghosts in Cindy's house knows how to defeat the aliens & Cindy sets out on a quest to find out the truth & discover a way to stop the alien invasion . . . Directed by David Zucker , the man behind Airplane ! ( 1980 ) , Police Squad & Naked Gun films , I have to say that I found Scary Movie 4 rather funny in a childish juvenile sort of way & there's absolutely nothing wrong with that at all . Zucker & his team took over the Scary Movie franchise from the Wayan brothers for Scary Movie 3 ( 2003 ) & turned in a decent effort although I think Scary Movie 4 is even better . As usual the laughs , jokes & gags in Scary Movie 4 are a mixture of parody & crude humour . From fart gags ( a pretty young blind woman enters a building full of people & goes to the toilet over a box & makes all sorts of fart noises ) to gay bashing ( a really funny send-up of Brokeback Mountain ( 2005 ) ) to sex ( Charlie Sheen eats a load of Viagra by mistake instead of aspirin & gets a traffic cone sized erection ) to poking fun at President Bush ( Leslie Nielsen paying more attention to a duck in a child's story than the attacking aliens ) to downright silliness ( a funny yet daft scene in which a guy trying to persuade Cindy to take a job has to try & cover-up some haunted house issues ! ) which isn't a bad thing . The most obvious thing to say about Scary Movie 4 is that whether you like it will depend on how funny you find it so if your not a fan of childish playground humour , crudeness & spoof's then I would advise to give this a miss . If however you do have a sense of humour & don't mid the politically incorrect & sometimes coarse & rude gags ( there's nothing wrong with that & don't let people use it as a stick to beat you with ) then you could do a lot worse than Scary Movie 4 , I must admit I laughed a lot during it & it's not often I say that . Of course what makes one person laugh is not necessarily the same as another but if you liked the previous Scary Movies & know what your letting yourself in for then give it a go as it's one of the best of the franchise . Beside making me laugh a lot Scary Movie 4 is really well made with surprisingly good special effects ( sometimes better than in the actual films it's sending-up ) , the alien invasion looks good as do some of the creepy Japanese horror inspired ghosts . There are plenty of parodies here from Saw ( 2004 ) to The Village ( 2004 ) , The Amityville Horror ( 2005 ) , War of the Worlds ( 2005 ) , Dark Water ( 2005 ) & The Grudge ( 2004 ) are some that come to mind as well as a spoof of the infamous Tom Cruise interview on Oprah . At not much over 80 odd minutes at least it's short & the gags come thick & fast . Despite featuring on the advertising & promotional material for the film King Kong does not appear . According to the IMDb this had a budget of about $50 , 000 , 000 which I find very hard to believe , I mean that's mega budget territory & bigger than most of the films it spoof's & sends-up . The production values are great & some of the sets look even better than the films they are being copied & ripped-off from ! The cast do alright , Anna Farris is still a hot looking lady while Bill Pullman , Leslie Nielsen , Michael Madsen , Carmen Electra , Shaquille O'Neal , Dr . Phil , Charlie Sheen & James Earl Jones in a neat Final Destination ( 2000 ) gag . Scary Movie 4 is exactly what you think it is , lots of crude sexual & bodily function humour pinned together by various parodies & send-ups of recent films . It's all good fun & I thought it was funny anyway , so shoot me . Not as good or funny as Scary Movie 2 ( 2001 ) but worth watching while Scary Movie 5 ( 2011 ) is currently in production .
Enjoyable enough teen slasher horror remake .	My Bloody Valentine is set in the small mining town of Harmony & starts as we learn that a tragedy has struck , in an explosion several miners have been killed with the comatose Harry Warden ( Richard John Walters ) the only survivor . However it later comes to light that Harry killed the miners himself to conserve the rapidly running out air , it's valentines day & Harry wakes from his coma & goes on a killing spree murdering over twenty people but is finally shot dead by Sheriff Burke ( Tom Atkins ) & buried under a cave-in . Jump forward ten years later & Harmony is still trying to forget the terrible events that haunt the town , as valentines day approaches the murders start again as someone dressed in mining gear wielding a pick-axe is brutally killing local residents connected with the mine . It's up to Sheriff Axel Palmer ( Kerr Smith ) to find the killer & lay a dark past to rest once & for all . . . Also known under the title My Bloody Valentine 3D this was directed by Patrick Lussier & is a fairly faithful remake of the early 80's Canadian slasher flick My Bloody Valentine ( 1981 ) , well when I say faithful a lot of the main imagery & ideas from the original are present & correct like the killer in gas mask & mining gear , the pick-axe killings , the teen slasher feel , a clueless Sheriff , the small mining town setting & ripped out human hearts in heart shaped valentine boxes . While this remake is a little more polished I can't really say it's a huge improvement or any worse for that matter , the murder mystery angle is played up a little more in this remake although it's not very sophisticated & does tend to slow the pace down at times . When finally revealed the killers motives & reasons are a little silly & improbable to say the least , the final revelation just isn't that satisfying & bits of the puzzle don't quite fall into place as neatly as they should . One area where this 2009 remake scores points over the original 1981 effort is in the gore department , with much more outlandish & memorable gore scenes than the heavily cut for an ' R ' rating original although it has since been re-released with some of that cut gore put back in . The character's are alright , the dialogue is alright & it's enjoyable enough I suppose without being particularly original but that ending just didn't quite work for me . When originally released the main gimmick with My Bloody Valentine was that it was in 3D using the Real D technology that a spate of other recent big blockbuster films like Beowulf ( 2007 ) , Bolt ( 2008 ) , Journey to the Center of the Earth ( 2008 ) , Coraline ( 2009 ) , Monsters vs Aliens ( 2009 ) & the forthcoming horror remake Piranha 3-D ( 2010 ) have so it looks like there's a market for it . The process uses those cheap glasses you wear & objects appear to jump out of the screen at you which is quite nice for novelty value but it's not used for much more here than pick-axes being flung at us & a few amusing gore effects like eyeballs on spikes & someones getting their jawbone ripped off & flung towards the audience . There's some great gore here , heads cut in half , a burned off face , people impaled on pick-axes , pick-axes shoved through peoples heads & jaws , lots of ripped out hearts , plenty of gory mutilated dead bodies , one ripped in half & it definitely delivers on the gore which is nice . There's also a really trashy sequence in which a naked blonde babe runs all over the place confronting her boyfriend & then trying to escape the killer while completely nude & director Lussier never misses the change to show off her rather fine body & breasts . With a supposed budget of about $15 , 000 , 000 this did pretty well at the box-office making a tidy 50 odd million , while the original had a bleak realistic look to it this Hollywood remake feels a little flat & too clean by comparison . Filmed in Pennsylvania to take advantage of various financial incentives . The acting is fine although the teen cast were probably chosen for their good looks rather than their ability & it's nice to see veteran Tom Atkins who is no stranger to the horror genre . My Bloody Valentine on it's own is a good solid gory horror thriller teen slasher which when you add the sometimes amusing 3D aspect of it I think it's well worth a watch . The only real downer is the ending which didn't work for me & one or two slightly slow moments & while it's no worse it's not really any better then the early 80's original .
" Transylvania , a wonderful place , a little gloomy but very exciting . " Visually impressive horror .	Nosferatu : Phantom der Nacht , or Nosferatu the Vampyre for English speaking audiences , starts with a terrific & eerie opening montage sequence of real mummified bodies from a museum in Guanajuato , Mexico . It's 1850 in the small European picturesque town of Wismar where Jonathan Harker ( Bruno Ganz ) is told by his boss Mr . Renfield ( Roland Topor ) that he has received a letter from a Count Dracula ( Klaus Kinski ) who wants to buy some property in Wismar , Harker is told to travel to Transylvania & finalise the deal . After 4 weeks of travel & despite various ominous warnings from the locals , Harker reaches the castle of Count Dracula a tall , thin , shaven headed pale man with very long fingernails & some sharp teeth . Over the next few days Harker witnesses strange events & discovers Dracula sleeping during the day in a crypt , Harker is locked into the castle & sees Dracula set off with a load of coffins . Harker is convinced Dracula is heading for Wismar & his wife Lucy ( Isabelle Adjani ) , upon Dracula's arrival in Wismar a plague of rats begin to spread a terrible disease throughout the town from which no one is safe as Dr . Van Helsing ( Walter Ladengast ) looks on helplessly . . . This German , French co-production was produced , written & directed by Werner Herzog , who also has a small cameo in the film , exists in at least two different versions , both English & German . The version I will be commenting on is the full uncut 2 hour English version released on DVD , I have not seen the German version which is also included as I haven't had time yet . So , with that in mind I will start my review . The script by Herzog based on the novel ' Dracula ' by Bram Stoker is a little on the slow side & isn't as straight forward as many vampire films are . There isn't really any significant neck biting or blood drinking , instead Dracula appears to prefer spreading a disease with rats . The English version is also rather slow & somewhat unfocused , at first we think Jonathan will be the hero but at about half-way he is almost completely forgotten about after which his wife Lucy takes centre stage despite her barely featuring until this point . It was quite hard for me to shift alliance's here & I'd have preferred Jonathan to be hero throughout , the story also seems to veer into a completely different direction about half-way with the majority of the start of Nosferatu : Phantom der Nacht taking place in Dracula's castle which then switches almost entirely to Wismar for the second half & both these sudden shifts in continuity give the film a sort of disjointed feel , as if two films were edited together . The character's are minimal & aren't given much background but it doesn't matter that much as a lot of Nosferatu : Phantom der Nacht is told through imagery . Which brings me nicely to the fantastic cinematography & visual style . Nosferatu : Phantom der Nacht is a great film to watch with some great shots & images , from the opening mummies to the way Dracula's shadow seems to have a life of it's own . From the beautiful scenery & landscapes to the gloomy , dark Gothic castle , a superbly shot & thought out film with bags of atmosphere . There is no blood or gore whatsoever which is a bit of a problem in my eyes as I want to see the red stuff in a horror film about a vampire , but maybe that's just me . A word about the music , the main theme is brilliant & I loved it , it really adds something to the film & stands out . The acting varies , Kinski as Dracula is perfect with his little mannerisms like the way he crosses his hands as is his appearance & make-up with his oddly positioned fangs , long fingernails , pale skin , shaven head & large mis-shaped ears , Adjani feels awkward & like she's trying too hard . Everyone else is OK I suppose . I liked Nosferatu : Phantom der Nacht more than I though I would , it's not perfect with a poor performance from Adjani & a generally slow & unfocused pace but there are plenty of positive things that make it well worth a watch like the outstanding visual style , Kinski as Dracula , a real dark atmosphere throughout & that cool theme music . Maybe the German version plays better as it's apparently at least 10 minutes shorter , I don't know . Something a bit different & not too bad at all .
" You know what I think about democracy let alone campers . " Decent slasher .	Camping del Terrore , or Body Count as it's more commonly known amongst English speaking audiences , is set in the rocky Colorado mountains & forests & starts with the brutal murder of two young teenage lovers Rose ( Clelia Fradella ) & her boyfriend Tom while making out in said forests . . . Jump ' 15 Years Later ' & two groups of friends are heading for a camping weekend in the Colorado mountains at a summer camp , despite being built on an ancient Indian burial ground that is supposedly haunted by an evil Shamen , owned by Julia ( Mimsy farmer ) & Robert Ritchie ( David Hess ) . The first group consisting of Tony ( Stefano Madia ) , Sidney ( Andrew J . Lederer ) , Cissy ( Cynthia Thompson ) , Tracy ( Nancy Brilli ) & Carol ( Luisa Maneri ) pick the Ritchie's son Benjamin ( Nicola Farron , isn't Nicola a female name ? ) on the way who is also heading to the camp for the summer . The second group , Dave ( Bruce Penhall ) , Sharon ( Elena Pompei ) & Scott ( Sven Kruger ) arrive at the same time . They are all introduced & go about their own thing . However , it's not long before tragedy strikes as Scott ' accidently ' falls from a cliff & Sharon goes missing . The remaining friends quickly discover that there is a homicidal maniac on the loose , could it possibly be the ancient legend of the evil Indian Shamen come to life ? Or is the real killer closer to home . . . This Italian American co-production was directed by Ruggero Deodato , whose only real claim to fame is that he directed the notorious Cannibal Holocaust ( 1980 ) , & I thought Camping del Terrore was actually a fairly decent slasher film , it's not brilliant but at least it delivered what I wanted it to . The script by Alessandro Capone , Luca D'Alisera , Sheila Goldberg & Dardando Sacchetti ( he HAD to be here somewhere ) is as straight forward as you can get , it's basically Friday the 13th ( 1980 ) made the Italian way ! It's all here , the free & easy teenage cast , the isolated camp , the forests , the local superstitions , legends & warnings , the dour adults , lots of people running around in the dark , a mask wearing homicidal maniac & most importantly a nice steady stream of gory killings , I mean what more do you want ? It sure sounds like a recipe for success to me ! It even manages to include some domestic problems soap-opera style ! Of course it goes without saying Camping del Terrore isn't perfect , when it focuses on the character's rather than the killings it becomes tedious & dull , people do stupid & illogical things to the extent you'll want to shout at the screen things like ' don't split up you idiots ! ' or ' don't go into that dark spooky room on your own ! ' & ' just turn around & run as fast as you can ! ' but these things are inherent problems within the slasher sub genre anyway , right ? A sub genre that is already overcrowded & somewhat limited to begin with . Director Deodato does an OK job , Camping del Terrore looks alright & moves along at a reasonable pace , at least you don't have to wait an eternity for the next death which is an absolute must in a slasher film such as this . There is a decent atmosphere to it & it has a late 80's vibe written all over it . The gore is pretty good , there are stabbings through peoples hands , heads & throats , impalings , someone has an axe stuck in their head , someone has their fingers cut off with an axe , there's a severed leg , a knife stuck through someones chest & the film as a whole has a pleasing amount of violence & blood . It certainly felt bloodier than the average Halloween ( 1978 ) , Friday the 13th , A Nightmare on Elm Street ( 1984 ) bloodless teen friendly kills littered throughout those films . Technically Camping del Terrore is OK but then what do you expect ? Oscar worthy material ? If you are then your definitely looking at the wrong film . The special effects are OK & it's competent throughout . The acting was pretty bad & what is Hess doing in this ? The dubbing was expectedly bad as was the cheesy music . I rather enjoyed Camping del Terrore , it's not boring , has a decent amount of kills & does just about everything I could expect . It just about stays on the right side of the line when it comes to silliness , this isn't high drama or anything but it has a certain conviction to it . I'm sure most of the filmgoing public out there would hate it but I don't really care as I thought it was well worth the 83 minutes of my time it took to watch it !
" You are so full of sht your eyes are brown . " Decent Masters of Horror episode .	Masters of Horror : Valerie on the Stairs starts as wannabe author Rob Hainsey ( Tyron Leitso ) pitches up outside Highberger House , a place for unpublished authors to stay & write . Rob is welcomed by the owner Nancy Bloom ( Nicola Lipman ) & is given a small room from which he can work in peace , however things turn creepy very quickly . At first there is constant loud knocking on Ray's door but when he answers it no-one is to be seen anywhere until he finally sees a young woman named Valerie ( Clare Grant ) sitting on the top of a flight of stairs but as Ray approaches her she disappears into the shadows & behind a brick wall . After several more encounters with the mysterious Valerie Ray becomes convinced that she is a ghost , however things aren't quite that simple . . . This Canadian American co-production was episode 8 from season 2 of Masters of Horror , written & directed by Mick Garris who is also the shows permanent executive producer I quite liked Valerie on the Stairs although it's not the best episode I've seen . The script was apparently based on a short story by Clive Barker ( why hasn't he made a Masters of Horror episode yet & while I'm thinking about it where's David Cronenberg's entry ? ) & starts out as a fairly effective ghost story but turns into something else completely by the end , in typical Barker style it turns into a story about twisted imagination , demons & torture . I have to mention the strange ending which literally comes from nowhere , I have to say I really liked it although I have to admit I didn't really understand it or what it represented but what the hell it just looked cool & felt right somehow . At less than an hour it moves along at a great pace so becoming bored shouldn't be a problem & it manages to sustain it's stories change in direction pretty well . On the negative said the ending felt rushed & the demon guy dies too easily . Director Garris does a good job & there's a nice bleak atmosphere running through Valerie on the Stairs , there's not much colour to it & Garris like to place his camera at the foot of narrow stairs looking up or at the end of a long cramped corridor which gives a nice claustrophobic feel . As a a whole this episode of Masters of Horror reminds of the film I , Madman ( 1989 ) which has a similar theme & basic idea . There's some nice gore as usual , someone has their spine ripped out through their mouth , someone has their breasts slashed open with a fountain of spurting blood the result & someone has a chunk bitten out of their neck . The special effects are top notch as always & the demon guy looks impressive . Techncially it's well made with good production values & to it's credit it doesn't look like a cheap TV show . The acting is pretty good , the ' name ' actor in this episode is Christopher Lloyd who puts in a good shift , Tony Todd also makes a appearance under layers of latex so you may not recognise him straight away . Valerie on the Stairs is a decent Masters of Horror episode , it's not the best one I've seen but it's far from the worst . I reckon it's worth a watch but I think most self respecting horror fans will anyway regardless of what anyone says .
A decent haunted house horror that I really rather liked .	The film opens in Los Angeles . Margaret Walsh ( Katherine Ross ) is talking on the phone , making sure a cheque for $50 , 000 from a British company called ' Wigans and Trumble development ' has cleared . She discusses it with her boyfriend Pete Danner ( Sam Elliott ) , it appears that the company has hired Margaret who is an architect but hasn't told her exactly what for . Margaret has been told to travel to England and asks Pete to go with her , to which he agrees . After one of the worst songs I've ever heard during the opening credits , ' Another Side of Me ' by Kiki Dee , Pete and Margaret are involved in an accident on a stretch of road in the middle of the English countryside with a Rolls-Royce because Pete was riding his motorbike on the wrong side . The both end up lying by the side of the road , their bike is badly damaged but they both walk away unharmed . The Rolls-Royce belongs to Jason Mountolive ( John Standing ) who along with his chauffeur Harry ( Ian Hogg ) makes sure Pete and Margaret are OK and sorts out a mechanic to repair Pete's motorbike . Jason also asks's Pete and Margaret to his house for tea . They feel they have little else to do and accept Jason's invitation . Jason's house turns out to be a majestic large country house . He invites them in and are greeted by a Nurse Adams ( Margaret Tyzack ) who strangely seems to be expecting them . More people arrive , Jacques Grandier ( Lee Montague ) , Karl Liebnecht ( Charles Gray , better known as Blofeld from Diamonds are Forever ( 1971 ) ) , Clive Jackson ( Roger Daltrey , yes the lead singer from ' The Who ' ) , Barbara Kirstenburg ( Hildegarde Neil ) and Maria Gabrieli ( Marianne Broome ) . Each guest wears a ring , the same ring that Margaret wears and cannot seem to remove however hard she tries . Both Pete and Margaret become suspicious and start to think that something strange might be going on . After one of the guests mysteriously dies and other odd occurrences happen Pete and Margaret decide they should leave . All their attempts to do so end in failure and accept that they aren't going anywhere for the time being . Pete and Margaret's happiness is shattered as some sort of evil force begins to influence and control Margaret's life . More guests start to die in mysterious ' accidents ' and Margaret starts to discover that her presence there is no coincidence . Margaret begins to search for the truth about why she is really there and who the now bed-ridden and incredibly ill Jason Mountolive actually is and what he wants . Eventually she finds the answers to the source of the evil power within the house and discovers her own ' Legacy ' ! Directed by Richard Marquand I actually really rather liked this haunted house horror film . Most people will probably be put off by the slow paced script by Jimmy Sangster , Patrick Tilley and Paul Wheeler which to be fair could have been a little tighter and less ponderous . But for me it didn't have long boring stretches of irrelevant dialogue or character development that nobody wants or needs , the majority of the script is relevant to the story and in a film like this we need to care at least on a basic level about the people involved . The twists and turns are revealed gradually , although not completely to my satisfaction and a few things could have been elaborated on a little bit more . The film managed to keep my interest throughout and I liked the overall story and where it went , even if the last couple of minutes didn't make a whole lot of sense and felt somewhat rushed and unfinished . The English country side and Stately house looks gorgeous , and with two extremely experienced cinematographers listed , Dick Bush and Alan Hume it should do . The production design by Disley Jones is top-notch too . We get shots of blood dripping down from an elaborately decorated ceiling into a wineglass , a point-of-view shot from inside a shower head , some nice underwater photography and generally speaking the film has a nice clean , crisp and impressive visual quality about it , much better than I was expecting anyway as is the whole film . There's not much in the way of blood or gore , a burnt corpse , an on-the-spot tracheostomy using a kitchen knife and someone is impaled in flying shards of glass from a broken mirror . The acting is OK , except Roger Daltrey who is simply awful and embarrassingly overacts for his death scene . It has faults to be sure and it isn't a masterpiece by any means , but for what it was I really liked it . Much more than I thought I would , worth watching but some may find it a little slow and somewhat silly .
A behind-the-scenes look at the special effects of Evil Dead II .	The Making of ' Evil Dead II ' or The Gore the Merrier is a short 30 odd minute documentary that was produced by Anchor Bay for their DVD release . The documentary almost entirely focuses on the special make-up effects , it features retrospective interviews with effects team Robert Kurtzman , Howard Berger & Gregory Nicotero who filmed all the camcorder behind-the-scenes footage featured . As you would expect they discuss the effects in a fairly obvious way in the sense of ' we moulded a fake head for that bit ' or ' he had a full latex body suit on ' sort of thing . What really makes this documentary invaluable for Evil Dead II ( 1987 ) fans is the candid on set footage shot by Nicotero , everyone seems very natural & like their having lots of fun . Sam Raimi , Bruce Campbell & various other cast & crew members are present in this raw footage but don't appear as interviewees which is a little disappointing as the documentary is very one dimensional & you wish other areas were discussed , nothings perfect I suppose . There are a few brief camcorder shots of scenes that didn't make it into the final cut of the film including the chopped up body of Ed ( Richard Domeier ) & the puppet with half of his head sliced off along with a scene where the possessed Ash eats a squirrel & one where the possessed head of Linda ( Denise Bixler ) in the vice vomits green slime over Ash . They talk about some of the effects & scenes that didn't go as planned . The documentary finishes of with a spoof of Re-Animator ( 1985 ) called Evil Dead Baby filmed by the effects crew in their spare time , probably . For what it is this is a great insight into the effects of Evil Dead II but I felt it was far too shallow & I would have liked to have seen a bit more participation from other members of the crew . This is essential for Evil Dead II fans but even they may be a little disappointed by how limited it actually is . Having said that it's still definitely worth watching especially since it's a free extra on a DVD .
" This place never had a murder rate until you people showed up . " I liked it .	I Still Know What You Did Last Summer is set one year after the events of the original I Know What You Did Last Summr ( 1997 ) where Julie James ( Jennifer Love Hewitt ) who suffers from terrible nightmares has moved from the small town of Southport & is living in the city with her best friend Karla Wilson ( Brandy ) while her boyfriend Ray ( Freddie Prinze Jr . ) still resides in Southport because of his job . One morning Karla gets a phone call from a radio station which offers her the chance to win four tickets to stay at a posh holiday resort in the Bahamas , all she has to do is answer one simple question correctly which she does . Karla invites her boyfriend Tyrell ( Mekhi Phifer ) & tells Julie she can have the remaining two tickets , Julie wants Ray to come but he says he can't make it so as a last minute emergency invites nice enough seeming Will ( Matthew Settle ) . Very excited they set off & appear to arrive in paradise as the isolated island is simply beautiful , however Julie soon starts to receive notes taunting her about the events of the previous summer & she becomes convinced everyone is in great danger as a torrential thunderstorm moves in . . . Directed by Danny Cannon I'm aware that I Still Know What You Did Last Summer has a pretty bad reputation , luckily I'm my own person & I don't pay any attention to reputation so it's with extreme proudness that I announce I really LIKE I Still Know What You Did Last Summer & if you don't agree which I'm positive many don't it's tough . The script by Trey Callaway is your basic teen slasher that were all the rage after the success of Scream ( 1996 ) although I Still Know What You Did Last Summer has a very serious tone rather than the light hearted one seen in Scream , one of the reasons I liked this is because it reminded of all those old classic slasher films from the 70's & 80's . While most of these films stuck to a simple premise they were pretty popular which is why so many were made I suppose & I Still Know What You Did Last Summer evoked memories of them for me , it's got the thunderstorm , the isolated cut off location , a cool hook handed killer who takes no nonsense , it's got some nice kills with decent amounts of blood & even though it's silly & improbable & they don't always work perfectly I rather liked the twists & turns which added that little something extra to the overall story . On the down side it also retains many of the problems with those early slasher films , the story is a bit one dimensional to say the least , the cast of young American teens are annoying especially Brandy's character who I'd have paid good money to see die , there are the usual fake scares & highly questionable coincidences which do stretch the films credibility to breaking point at times . It certainly moves along at a nice pace , I was never bored , while not the most gripping film ever I did actually want to follow it through & over it's 100 odd minute duration it entertained me & just for the record I also liked the really silly & cheesy ending scene . Director Cannon does fine , I think there's a decent atmosphere here & you can almost feel the warmth of the sun from some of the location shooting . I thought there were a few reasonably effective scare scenes & I have to say I really liked the way it's shot with regular muted soft colour schemes . There's some good gore as well , the killer gets to use his hook by sticking it in peoples hands , slashing their throats , dragging people across the floor with it embedded in their flesh , he sticks some garden shears in someones chest , there's a machete stuck in someones head , people are impaled on a harpoon & someone has the hook shoved through their throat . With a supposed budget of about $24 , 000 , 000 I Still Know What You Did Last Summer has that Hollywood polish about it & it's well made throughout although there is one scene which always bugs me because it could have been rectified so easily , it's at the end when Julie is firing a Colt revolver which holds 6 ( count them 6 ) bullets & she fires at least 8 shots which is psychically impossible because 8 doesn't go into 6 , obviously . Surely someone could have noticed this & just edited the scene down so she fired 6 instead of 8 ? The acting is alright , Hewitt is OK but that Brandy , urgh ! It was nice to see Jeffrey Combs in a small role too . I Still Know What You Did Last Summer seems almost universally hated by just about everyone , that makes me even more pleased to try & balance things out a bit & confirm to a curious world that here are indeed film-goers out here that enjoy I Still Know Whay You Did Last Summer warts & all & if you don't like it sue me ! Followed by the straight-to-video I'll Always Kow What You Did Last Summer ( 2006 ) .
" He killed 12 people , wounded 23 more , stole 6 cars most of them Ferrari's , robbed 8 banks , 6 supermarkets , 4 jewelry stores & a candy shop . " Entertaining Sci-Fi horror .	The Hidden starts with black & white footage from a banks security camera as Jack DeVries ( Chris Mulky ) enters the bank , pulls a shotgun out & robs it . He makes his escape in a black Ferrari but Los Angeles finest are hot on his tail as they speed through the streets , eventually DeVries is brought to a halt when the cops shoot his Ferrari up . DeVries gets out of the car & is repeatedly shot , the Ferrari blows up . Lieutenant John Masterson ( Clarence Felder ) receives a visit from FBI agent Lloyd Gallagher ( Kyle MacLachlan ) who is looking for a suspect & requires a partner for a few days , Masterson gives him Detective Tom Beck ( Micheal Nouri ) who tells him that he recognises his suspect as Jack DeVries & he is lying in a hospital bed badly injured & will not make it through the night . Meanwhile at the hospital DeVries happens to have an alien inside him that can switch bodies , a patient named Jonathan Miller ( William Boyett ) in the next bed will do . The alien switches bodies & starts yet another crime spree , he steals another Ferrari , beats a shopkeeper to death , kills some-more people & most seriously plays loud music in a restaurant on his radio annoying everyone in there . All of this criminal activity filters back to Beck who is now told by Gallagher that their suspect is Miller . The alien continues to jump form body to body to evade detection , it becomes aware that an important Senator named Holt ( John McCnn ) who maybe the next President is in town & the alien likes the idea of being President of the United States . . . Directed by Jack Sholder I thought The Hidden was a decent film . The script by Jim Kouf moves along at a nice pace & never becomes boring or dull as it mixes various genres including Sci-Fi , horror & action . The aliens origins & motivations are left unclear & the taking over the Senator to become the next President sub plot feels like an afterthought that isn't really developed or used until the end but as the characters say in the film itself the alien commits these acts of violence ' because he likes it ' & I guess because he can , when you think about it no other explanation is needed I suppose . The Ferrari car chase at the start is cool but the Ferrari never sustains any damage as it keeps hitting other cars , pedestrians & roadside objects but in the next wide shot the Ferrari is almost brand new again , there are some glaring continuity flaws & errors in this sequence . The Hidden also suffers from the usual 80's action cliché where everyone is killed by the baddie except the two heroes whom it can't seem to shoot unlike everyone else for some reason . There are a few gunfights , the alien only makes two appearances & there isn't any explicit gore in The Hidden . I thought the ending was a bit sickly & overly happy , it felt like something out of a Disney film ! I would have liked to have seen more of the stripper Brenda ( Claudia Christian ) who looked great in a mini-skirt & thigh high boots as she posed with big guns & engaged in firefights . Technically The Hidden is good with nice production values even if some of the optical effects look a bit crap compared to todays CGI & I thought the acting was pretty good as well especially Nouri as the likable Beck . Overall I thought The Hidden was a good solid , entertaining film that was an enjoyable way to spend 90 odd minutes but seemed a little silly at times & the plot was a bit sparse when all said & done . Definitely worth a watch though .
One of the truly great 80's slashers .	Intruder is set in Wallnut mini supermarket store where store owners Danny ( Eugene Robert Glazer ) & his partner Bill ( Danny Hicks ) have decided to sell up after two consecutive years of making a loss , they tell the unfortunate night crew that they will be losing their jobs & that they have to stay all night to mark all the products up on the shelves as half price . A young cashier named Jennifer ( Elizabeth Cox ) has an unpleasant visit from her violent ex-boyfriend Craig ( David Byrnes ) which turns nasty & the police are called but Craig disappears before they arrive , the market is closed for the night & the crew carry on with their work . However someone inside the market is killing everyone off one-by-one in a variety of gruesome ways . . . Originally filmed under the title Night Crew this delightfully gory 80's slasher flick was co-written & directed by Scott Speigel who played the guy who delivered the bread & got a knife stuck in his back Intruder is surely one of the true slasher greats from the 80's , it just ticks all the right boxes with distinction . The script by Speigel & producer Lawrence Bender who played one of the two cops at the end is like a cross between Dawn of the Dead ( 1978 ) with it's supermarket setting & Friday the 13th ( 1980 ) with it's gory killing of various teens , lets be honest here what more do you need for a great horror flick ? I mean it's got the isolated location & it's got plenty of victims so the only thing left to wonder about is whether the blood & gore is excessive enough & Intruder passes the test with flying colours as it features some of the greatest & goriest on screen deaths ever in a slasher flick . From people literally having their heads sliced in half with industrial band saws , eyes impaled on spikes , meat cleavers in heads , people hung on meat hooks , enough severed limbs to fill a butchers shop & my personal favourite when someone has their head literally squashed to pulp in a trash compactor . I also liked the ending where , it seems , the bad guy actually gets away with it in a sense . The character's are reasonably likable for a slasher flick , the story is decent although I think it spends too much time trying to implicate Craig as the killer so it's not that surprising when it turns out it isn't him . On the negative side I thought the films pace was a bit uneven , the first 30 minutes is all set-up & no-one is killed at all during this period & in fact it's sometimes hard to remember your actually watching a horror film , then it bursts into life with a constant stream of gory highly entertaining killings for the next 30 minutes & then for the final 20 it goes into standard stalk & slasher mode as the killer plays a game of cat & mouse with the one surviving teen . Director Speigel does a fine job & injects some life & style into what could have turned out to be a dull film , his camera angles are interesting & some of his shots are cool like showing someone on the phone from inside the phone looking up at her , the shots from inside a trolley as it is wheeled around the market are fun & there's even a shot from the perspective of a door knob as it's being turned . A visually enjoyable film . Then again shots like those are merely there to fill the time up between the gore effects from the boys from KNB . The murders are all pretty gory & look incredibly good , the band saw scene is a real shocker as is the part when the guy has his head crushed by a trash compactor . They are pretty brutal scenes & rank amongst the best deaths ever seen in any slasher film ever . The trailer for Intruder ( on all the DVD releases ) contains a bit of extra gore from the scene when the guy is impaled on a meat hook , it show's the a close-up of his & chin the hook actually entering it along with a close-up of his face & blood pouring from his mouth . The trailer also features an unaltered shot during the scene when the woman is talking on the phone looking up at her but without the transparent dialler over the screen to signify that we are looking at her from inside the phone itself . It is amazing to think that Intruder had a budget of about $100 , 000 which is frankly peanuts . This looks good with extremely impressive gore effects & is well made , the makers certainly got the most out of the meagre budget . Low budget killer doll auteur Charles Band was an executive producer on this & was going to distribute it under his Empire label but that went bankrupt & Paramount picked it up for distribution , they cut it down to get an R rating & every gore scene was completely cut or edited in some way so make sure you stay away from that version . The acting is fine , Rene Estevez has gone on to star in the political TV drama series The West Wing ( 1999 - 2006 ) & is the younger sister of Charlie Sheen & Emilio Estevez . Sam Raimi is an accomplished director in his own right responsible for the Evil Dead & recent Hollywood Spider-Man series of films & Bruce Campbell has a small cameo at the end as a cop . Intruder is one of the very best 80's slasher films , it has the gore , the isolated location , a decent killer , some visual style between the killings & is enjoyable on many levels . A must for slasher fans & anyone who likes their films nice & gory , the band saw head slicing & trash compactor head crushing scenes are worth the price of rental alone .
" I never saw such rotten crap in my life , where did you get this sht ? " Great comic book style anthology .	Creepshow starts as an angry father ( Tom Atkins ) throws his young son's ( Joe King , Stephen King's son ! ) comic book copy of Creepshow away , however Bill won't be denied his fix of ghoulish stories . . . First up is ' Father's Day ' where at an annual family reunion horrible relative Nathan Grantham ( Jon Lormer ) comes back from the dead to get what's owed to him . . . Then it's ' The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill ' where a strange meteorite crash lands on farmer Jordy Verrll's ( Stephen King ) land , he thinks he might be able to make some money out of it but the meteorite also brought something else with it . . . Next it's ' Something to Tide You Over ' in which a man named Richard Vickers ( Leslie Nielsen ) extracts a cruel revenge on his cheating wife Rebbecca ( Gaylen Ross ) & her boyfriend Harry Wentworth ( Ted Danson ) but it backfires . . . ' The Crate ' is about a college janitor ( Don Keefer ) who finds a dusty old crate under some stairs which contains a shocking surprise . . . Finally it's ' They're Creeping Up on You ' in which a rich businessman named Upson Pratt ( E . G . Marshall ) has a bug problem , a big bug problem that could well turn out to be the death of him . . . Directed by George A . Romero I thought Creepshow was a fantastically fun horror anthology . The script was by none other than Stephen King who also starred in ' The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill ' & has that great darkly humorous feel about it that many of the best Tales from the Crypt ( 1989 - 1993 ) episodes do & the similarities don't stop there either , each story is around the 25 minute mark , each one has a decent enough twist ending although at 2 hour in length it perhaps runs for one story too many . My personal favourite story was ' The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill ' as I thought it was the most original & had the best ending as well . I'd put ' Something to Tide You Over ' as my least favourite because it drags in places & seemed like a routine revenge thriller with a standard ' bad guy getting his just deserts ' ending which you can see coming well before it arrives . The character's are all larger than life stereotypes but you need that when there's such little time to develop them & the trick is to make you care for them within that short space of time , Romero & King do a good job of it & they all serve their purpose well enough & they are quite well fleshed out . The opening & closing wraparound segments also work well as a little mini story in itself . Director Romero does a good job here while he was still capable of turning in a good film , I love the comic book look & feel of Creepshow as it suits the material perfectly , I love the colour schemes & the effect where he flicks between scenes like someone is turning the page of a comic , certain scenes are accompanied by comic book style borders & have boxes which contain three or four different images at once & ' The Next Day . . . ' type text . This is as close to a comic book as you can get I suppose , there's some decent gore here , there are bullets through heads , bitten necks , slashed faces , decapitated heads , thousands of cockroaches literally explode from someones chest & there's plenty of blood splatter & other make-up effects . With a modest sounding $800 , 000 budget Romero has made five mini films & each one is pretty impressive , it's well made with good special effects from Tom Savini & nice production values . The acting is OK with several very familiar faces amongst the cast including Hal Holbrook , Adrienne Barbeau & Ed Harris . Creepshow is a terrific anthology tale based horror film featuring monsters , voodoo , murder , zombies & alien grass so what more do you want ? It's right up there with the best of them , definitely well worth a watch . Followed by a not quite as good sequel Creepshow 2 ( 1987 ) & more recently an as yet unseen by me Creepshow III ( 2006 ) .
I don't care what anyone says , I love Robocop 2 .	Robocop 2 is again set in Detroit in the near future a year after the events of the original Robocop , Detroit is almost entirely financed by the company OCP . The city is in a state lawlessness as most of the cops are on strike as OCP cut their pay , OCP President ( Dan O'Herlihy ) watches on as his plan to foreclose on the current administration is working which will let OCP take complete control of Detroit . Out on the street a new addictive drug called Nuke is flooding the city , crime & violence follows it . Robocop & the few remaining cops have their hands full . Meanwhile evil scientist Dr . Juliette Faxx ( Belinda Bauer ) has set about creating a successor to Robocop , another cyborg crime prevention unit to protect & serve . However her real motives aren't as noble as they first seem . . . Directed by Irvin Kershner this sequel to the popular Robocop ( 1987 ) was unfairly trashed on it's initial release & has a pretty bad reputation but it's a film that I love & while not quite as good as the original in my opinion it's still a terrific film that is probably more fun to watch than it's predecessor . The script credited to Frank Miller was apparently heavily rewritten & maybe that's why the story is a little choppy at times , for instance the character's are good but what was the comedy relief Mayor all about ? Robocop's partner Lewis is relegated to standing around for the majority of the film & only seems there to provide some continuity to the original . Why was the subplot about Murphy's wife so short & dropped as soon as it was brought up ? That would have given Robocop 2 a human edge . However the biggest single problem with Robocop 2 I have is why would anyone put the brain of a sadistic killer & drug baron into a heavily armed cyborg ? It just doesn't make any sort of sense , what was Dr . Faxx's reasons behind it ? It was supposed to be a police unit , right ? Why get it addicted to Nuke as well ? If you don't think about it too much it probably won't bother you . Now the good stuff , it moves along at a great pace with lots of action & I just love the huge over-the-top Robocop vs . Robocop 2 fight at the end , any serious sci-fi geek will lap it up . While the pitch black biting satire of the original isn't quite here there are still some nice moments including OCP trying to take control of Detroit & use it to make a profit , some funny commercial breaks ( the one with the guy who commits suicide is funny ) & the sequence where Robocop is reprogrammed to be good & none violent by upper class twits who have never lived in the real world is hilarious . I just think there is so much here to enjoy , plenty of gory violent action , lots of special effects , cool robots , car chases , explosions & some neat action scenes . What's not to like ? I really like the look of Robocop 2 & I liked the special effects . I think Robocop 2 was one of the last big budget theatrically released films to predominantly use stop-motion animation for the majority of the effects , over the next couple of years with the likes of Terminator 2 : Judgment Day ( 1991 ) & Jurassic Park ( 1993 ) in particular stop-motion died out virtually overnight & was replaced by CGI . I personally love stop-motion animation , it gives you the sense that there is actually something three dimensional there & while it can sometimes look a little jerky I seriously doubt if Robocop 2 was CGI it would look significantly any better . The Robocop vs . Robocop 2 fight at the end is just outrageous , from elevator shafts to the top of 100 storey buildings the makers have fun & in turn we , the audience , have fun . Well , I did anyway . Robocop 2 is also a very violent & pretty gory film , from snipers getting shot through their eye to dozens of people getting gorily riddled with bullets , there's a torture scene as someone is sliced open , there's a very gory brain removal sequence as there is a human brain in a tank & the person it used to belong to's hollowed out decapitated head , necks are violently broken , kids are shot & a guy has his eye poked out by a stiletto heel . Technically the film is good with some great special effects in my opinion although some may find them a bit dated . Filmed in Houston in Texas . The acting is alright , the main villain Cain played by Tom Noonan isn't a patch on Boddicker from the original though . Robocop 2 is a film that I think is fantastic , it's got some cool robots & lots of fun special effects sequences as well as plenty of blood , gore & violence although the dark satire of the first film is somewhat replaced by goofy silliness it tries to please everyone . Followed by the dire Robocop 3 ( 1993 ) , the TV series Robocop ( 1994 - 1995 ) & the TV mini-series Robocop : Prime Directives ( 2000 ) .
" How can I prove I don't want to eat you ? " Classic episode .	Monsters : My Zombie Lover starts on the ' night of the dead ' when in a small town the dead return to life as flesh eating zombies , the locals all tool themselves up with guns & go zombie hunting including mom ( Mrcella Lowery ) & dad ( Ed Wheeler ) of two . While out shooting zombies the daughter Dottie ( Tempestt Bledsoe ) decides to stay at home , a short time later there is a knock at the door by a guy Dottie used to know at school named Paul Nichols ( Steve Harper ) the only problem is he was killed in a car accident . Now a flesh eating zombie Paul remembers Dottie & as they spend the night together begin to fall for each other but Dottie's family hates zombies & Paul needs human flesh to live which may be big problems for the relationship in the long run . . . Episode five from season one of Monsters this originally aired in the US during November 1988 , written & directed by David Misch I have to say that I loved this quirky zombie love story & thought it was a perfectly judged mix of laughs , morals & light hearted chills . The character's really make My Zombie Lover , from the funny young kid who is an anti-zombie killing protester to the all American shoot first don't bother to ask questions later father to the self conscious zombie Paul who is all too aware that bits of himself are falling off ! There's some hilarious one-liners too delivered in a very funny deadpan way like after Paul proposes to Dottie she says ' you don't want my hand in marriage you want it in a sandwich ' in regard to his carnivorous tendencies & after finding true love Paul's exclamation that ' today's the first day of the rest of my death ' had me laughing to the ' I thought you ate my daughter ' line said in total seriousness at the end by the father . Talking of the ending the twist is pretty good too & well as being funny like the rest of the episode . My Zombie Lover is a very funny twisted cross between Night of the Living Dead ( 1968 ) & Casablanca ( 1942 ) if you can imagine such a thing . The script also tries to deliver a potent social message too & has a thinly veiled dig at racism & American attitudes towards those they fear . Highly amusing & at only just over twenty minutes in length you won't get the chance to become bored . Like many Monsters episodes ( & Tales from the Darkside that preceded it ) My Zombie Lover takes place on a single set with only five cast members so it has a staged in front of a studio audience sitcom sort of feel to it that suits the material perfectly . The monster in this episode is obviously Paul the zombie , while his make-up is alright I've seen better zombie make-up effects although the makers couldn't make him too disgusting since that would have affected the way we the audience felt about him . The only gory moment is when the zombies ear falls off onto the floor . The acting is good although everything is played for laughs . My Zombie Lover is a hilarious twenty minutes that spoofs both the horror & romance genres down to a tee , I thought it worked perfectly & I found it very funny although the other IMDb user ratings suggest I seem to be in the minority ( until now no-one else has rated it over 6 ) .
" The network won't even consider it unless unless there's at least three confirmed dead . " Another great Maniac Cop film .	Maniac Cop 3 : Badge of Silence starts where Maniac Cop 2 ( 1990 ) ended with the funeral of the Maniac Cop himself Matt Cordell ( Robert Z'Dar ) . However at the same time a Voodoo priest brings him back to life , with the aid of a little bit of black magic & a severed head . It's just another ordinary crime ridden night in New York as Officer Kate Sullivan ( Gretchen Becker ) responds to a pharmacy robbery where high on drugs junkie Frank Jessup ( Jackie Earle Haley ) is shooting dead any police that get anywhere near him , Kate manages to shoot Jessup but is shot herself by the crooked shop assistant who organised the robbery & badly injured but also manages to shoot & kill the assistant . Two freelance cameramen Bishop ( Bobby Di Cicco ) & Tribble ( Frank Pesce ) capture the incident on film & re-edit it so it appears that Kate shot two unarmed suspects hoping to cause controversy & make lots of money , her close friend Detective Sean McKinney ( Robert Davi ) sets out to clear her name . The Maniac Cop Matt Cordell takes an interest in Kate & starts to kill those wanting to switch off her life support . . . The third , & thus far the last , entry in the Maniac Cop series of films Maniac Cop 3 : Badge of Silence was originally going to be directed by William Lustig but was completed by co-producer Joel Soisson after Lustig walked out , apparently even scriptwriter Larry Cohen voiced a dissatisfaction at how the film ended up . The truth of what actually happened behind the scenes may never be known but it makes you wonder , doesn't it ? While parts of the film don't work as well as they could have I still think Maniac Cop 3 : Badge of Silence is a really good horror film . First the negative things , the film never really explains why the Voodoo priest guy brings Cordell back from the dead . He doesn't make Cordell do anything or try to control him so why bring him back ? The ending is very silly , why does the seat Cordell is sitting in not catch fire ? It's not made clear why Cordell takes such an interest in Kate , I think maybe because he sees much of what happened to him in her but the link is somewhat tenuous . Now the positive , Maniac Cop 3 : Badge of Silence is well written , a bit different , witty , clever while it also tries to say things & in this regard it has a certain amount of success like city corruption , the importance of money over human life , biased edited for TV news coverage , an uncaring medical profession & the legal right's of a criminal over those of the innocent . It moves along at a nice pace , is never boring & entertains from start to finish . Director's Lustig & Soisson give the film a nice look & special mention goes to cinematographer Jacques Haitkin ( who has worked on over 75 films ) as Maniac Cop 3 : Badge of Silence looks fabulous throughout , from the candle lit Voodoo rituals to the cold , clinical & sterile Hospital interiors this is one great looking , atmospheric & moody film . The gore was disappointing , I have no idea if the version I saw was uncut but apart from a severed head & it's headless body , a few gory gunshot wounds & someone with their face melted there isn't much to speak of . There is a really cool car chase at the end with a burning Matt Cordell behind the wheel of a police car trying to catch McKinney . Technically Maniac Cop 3 : Badge of Silence is very good , the stunts at the end are great , the photography is great , I really liked the music & it's generally well made . The acting is pretty strong by all involved & Caitlin Dulany as Dr . Fowler is a bit of a babe & easy on the eye's . I really liked Maniac Cop 3 : Badge of Silence , it lacks a bit of logic but it tries to raise a few issues & have some twisted fun with them . Not as good as the first two entry's but still a great film in it's own right , in my humble opinion . Definitely worth a watch .
" Right through the eye & into the brain . " I quite liked it actually .	Satan's Slave starts with a human ( naked ) female sacrifice during a Devil worshipping ceremony . . . Jump to present day London where Catherine Yorke's ( Candace Glendenning ) 20th birthday fast approaches , she , along with her father Malcolm ( James Bree ) & mother Elizabeth ( Celia Hewitt ) , has been invited to stay at the country estate of her uncle , Dr . Alexander Yorke ( Michael Gough ) . Just as they arrive at the property Malcolm loses control of his car & crashes into a tree , Catherine is unhurt & runs for help as Malcolm stays in the car to look after the injured Elizabeth unfortunately before Catherine can obtain any help the car explodes & her parents are toast . Her uncle Alexander comforts her & offers her his every assistance & insists that she stay with him , his son Stephen ( Martin Potter ) & his personal secretary Frances ( Barbara Kellerman ) who all make Catherine feel very welcome . Despite seeing her parents burned alive Catherine feels OK & decides to take a walk through the woods with Stephen where she experiences a disturbing vision of human sacrifice , torture & her own death . However , this is just the beginning as Catherine discovers her uncle has a sinister plan for her which involves murder , satanic rituals & the resurrection of an ancient witch . . . This English production was directed by Norman J . Warren & like the rest of his trashy horror exploitation films that have recently been given a new lease of life on DVD I really rather enjoyed it . The script by David McGillivray , who has a small cameo in the film as a Priest in the scene when the woman ( Monika Ringwald ) is flogged & branded , moves along at a nice pace has a decent story with a few nice twists & turns & , thankfully , never forgets it's sleazy exploitation roots , just the way I like them . I mean Stephen brutally kills women for no other reason than for sleaze value & to bump up both the body count & gore quotient , there's no logical reason for him to kill women totally unconnected with anything else but Warren & McGillivray correctly knew this is the sort of thing us horror fans want to see ! The character's are OK but no one is going to watch Satan's Slave for it's dramatic qualities , are they ? Some of it's a bit silly like the elevator scene but overall Satan's Slave worked for me on many levels , was entertaining & was a good way to spend just over 80 minutes of my time . Director Warren does a good job here , Satan's Slave has that unique , & frankly priceless , 70's sleazy grimy feel throughout . From the satanic rituals where every female in sight has to be naked to the sexual violence & the free flowing blood & gore , good stuff Norman . The nasty stuff in Satan's Slave is pretty extreme & exploitative , someone has their head bashed in & then is gorily stabbed , a woman is tied to a tree , flogged & then branded , more people are stabbed with blood splattering results , a knife is stuck through someone's mouth & a scene in which someone has a nail file stuck into their eyeball , luckily Warren doesn't skimp on the blood or the close-ups in these scenes either . I also just love the whole 70's look of the film , the fashions , the decor like the horrible orange wallpaper for instance & the cars . Technically Satan's Slave is well made with nice period flashback scenes , good widescreen cinematography , decent music & a great looking central location . On the down side it does look a bit cheap occasionally though . The acting is alright & I quite fancy Glendenning in this although I thought she took witnessing her parents being burned alive rather too well . Michael Craze's acting in the silly elevator scene is just plain embarrassing . Satan's Slave is a bit of a British exploitation film gem that I really liked . The whole look , the feel & atmosphere & the story impressed & entertained me . I think this is a must for exploitation & horror fans , definitely well worth a watch although those with sensitive dispositions may want to give it a miss .
" Either you cut my hand off or I'll kill you . " Brilliant in it's badness .	Demonoid , Messenger of Death starts some 300 years ago in a Mexican mine where some ancient demon or other possesses the left hand of a woman , she is chained to a wall by robed religious fanatics & her left hand is cut off with an axe the disembodied hand then tries to scuttle away but a guy stabs it & places it into a silver hand shaped casket . Cut to the present in a town called Guanajato in Mexico where Jennifer Baines ( Samantha Eggar ) has just arrived to join her husband Mark ( Roy Jenson ) who has recently brought the mine & intends to reopen it , once at the mine Jennifer causes a wall to collapse & reveal a mummified body , women eh ? The local workers start bricking themselves & refuse to enter the mine due to ancient legends about the ' Devil's Hand ' , soon after while in the mine together on they're own Mark & Jennifer stumble across a room with the glove shaped casket in it & Mark decides to take it . Later that night Mark opens the casket & finds nothing but dust , however a hand reforms itself from the dust & possesses Mark . The ancient left hand possessing demon is free & goes about doing what it does best , possessing people's hands with the ultimate aim of possessing Jennifer's for some reason I'm not sure of . . . This Mexican American co-production was co-written , produced & directed by Alfredo Zacarias & is one zany , crazy & at times gob-smacking exploitation film that provides terrific entertainment for it's slight running time of 78 minutes . I feel Demonoid , Messenger of Death is an ambassador for the much neglected , maligned & under-appreciated sub-genre of possessed killer hand films , I mean there are literally 100's of films featuring evil aliens , indestructible homicidal maniacs , giant bugs , ghosts , Dinosaurs , genetic mutated monsters , zombies & scientific experiments gone bad but how many possessed killer hand films can you name ? Not many & that my friends must be addressed . . . Sorry , I got carried away there . Anyway , the script by Zacarias , David Lee Fein & F . Amos Powell really is as crazy & bizarre as it sounds , at least it shows a lot of imagination & it clearly has the intention of trying to fill every last second of screen time with some bizarre situation . Overall Demonoid , Messenger of Death doesn't make that much sense & you can't take it seriously but that's all part of the fun . I absolutely love the scene in which a policeman walks into a Doctor's surgery & demands at gunpoint that the Doctor cut his hand off or he'll kill him , this part is played 100 % straight & the ridiculousness doesn't end there . There are numerous flying severed hands , satanic rituals , dodgy gamblers , disbelieving priest's , mummy's , re-animated corpses , ancient demons , gore , nudity , bad Mexican actor's , a car chase , a woman who thinks walking into a pitch black cavernous mine 100's of years old wearing high heels is a good idea & a pace which never lets up . I have to admit I really liked this goofy film , it was just so entertaining for all the wrong reasons . Director Zacarias creates some pretty decent moments , the sequence where the hand reforms & is inter-cut with footage of real mummified bodies is particularly effective . There are plenty of dumb & downright silly moments in it but god damn I had fun with it . It has that cheap & sleazy early 80's horror film vibe to it & there's some decent gore as well . There are , of course , lots of severed hands but also some decent severing methods like one guy who puts his hand under the wheels of a moving train , ouch ! There are surgical removals & one is severed by repeatedly shutting it in a car door & the hands preferred method of murder is to attach itself to someone's face & then squeeze it until the person dies ! Technically the film is OK , it's a little rough around the edges but I doubt the filmmakers had much money to work with . The special effects vary from really bad to just bad . I thought the music sounded very familiar & I was right because most of it is stolen from The Incredible Melting Man ( 1977 ) . The acting was OK & you have to consider the fact that it's very hard to convincingly fight your own hand while it's still attached to your arm , isn't it ? Demonoid , Messenger of Death is a pretty unique film , it's certainly something a bit different & overall I was throughly entertained by it . I can't really recommend it as most sane people would probably hate it but if your a fan of obscure exploitation then this is an absolute must . Mr Zacarias , the film-making world needs more people like you , I mean they just don't , won't or simply can't make ' em like this anymore which is not a good thing in my book .
" I hope I give you the shts " Brilliant stuff , ' Werewolves ate my platoon ' , I loved it .	Dogs Soldiers is set in the isolated Highlands of Scotland where a platoon of soldiers lead by Sergeant Harry Wells ( Sean Pertwee ) are dropped off on a regular training exercise . However things take a turn for the worse when they discover a special ops platoon totally slaughtered & the only survivor being Captain Ryan ( Liam Cunningham ) , they are then attacked by Werewolves who kill one of the soldier's . The remaining troops run & luckily run into Megan ( Emma Cleasby ) who all then drive off to the nearest house for shelter , unfortunately the Werewolves destroy their jeep & there are no phones to call for help & they are a four hour drive from the nearest town . Their problems mount as they quickly run out of ammo , the Werewolves start to pick the platoon off one-by-one & as the night draws on their chances of survival seem very slim . . . This British Luxembourg co-production was edited , written & directed by Neil Marshall & I thought Dog Soldiers was a totally brilliant horror film & over several viewings since it first came out has become an absolute fave of mine . The script has a definite sense of humour & doesn't take itself too seriously although it is at heart quite basic with a platoon of under-equipped soldiers stuck in a dangerous situation with monsters coming at them from all directions , yep I've got an Aliens ( 1986 ) with a little Evil Dead ( 1982 ) thrown in there feeling as well , but it never tries to be anything else & taken on that premise , as pure thrilling entertainment , it's as good as anything out there in the horror genre as far as I'm concerned . The character's are perfect & there isn't an annoying American teen in sight , the dialogue is great & these feel like real people as they talk dirty , talk about football & just seem natural & very likable . The film moves along at an almost perfect pace , it keeps on going but it also manages to take the time to develop the character's which makes what happens on screen so much more engaging . The film doesn't mess around with Werewolf film-lore too much & there are some top gore moments . I don't really have anything negative to say about Dog Soldiers , I thought it was brilliant , top-drawer entertainment all the way & it's as simple & straight forward as that . Director Marshall does a great job , the action scenes & shoot-outs are cool & he works wonders on what must have been a low budget . The special effects are great & very impressive while I cannot applaud the decision to not use CGI enough , he films the Werewolves with quick cuts & the camera never lingers on them for too long but crucially the action always remains clear throughout & you can tell what's happening despite the quick editing . There's some nice touches here & there , there's a good atmosphere & there are a few good old fashioned scares here as well . There's some good gore here , there's plenty of blood & intestines splattered around , someone is impaled on a branch , someone has their stomach torn open & their guts spill out & there's a nice decapitation in here as well . There's plenty of the red stuff , sorted . Technically Dog Soldiers is better than it has any right to be with surprisingly good effects apart from the exploding toy house at the end & despite being set in Scotland it was actually filmed in Luxembourg not that you would ever know unless someone told you . The acting was very good by an unknown cast . Dog Soldiers is absolutely top-notch stuff from start to finish , sure not every single person out there will agree but films are all about personal opinion & I thought it was most brilliant . Nothing else to say other than watch it as soon as you can . Director Neil went on to make the almost as excellent The Descent ( 2005 ) while according to the IMDb a sequel Dog Soldiers : Fresh Meat ( 2007 ) is currently in pre-production .
