a true mystery	The name Joan Allen , so often associated with high quality , is used to attract innocent video renters to this film . They will be disappointed . What is alleged to be the story of a brave Irish journalist is instead a two-part mystery : a ) why did Joan Allen agree to do this film ? and b ) what were all those people with thick brogues saying ? Not only was a good deal of the dialogue unintelligible , but the film seemed like it began in the middle of the story , which was disconcerting - among so much that was disconcerting . A very dissipated Patrick Bergin , a long way from Sleeping with the Enemy , plays a frustrated cop . There's enough graphic violence , swearing with Irish brogues and skeevy looking characters to make three more films . No , thanks , one was MORE than enough .
a fun plot gone wrong	This is a disaster of a movie with a plot that could have been hilarious . I'm not sure what went wrong , other than the fact that it seemed unevenly cast and the script was just downright bad . It's a shame because it's a great premise . It should have been much , much funnier . Instead , it was slow , somewhat mean-spirited , and boring .
hard to take	This is a badly dated melodrama about an actress whose dark past is revealed by a conniving reporter . Kay Francis is luminous , but she can't play trash . When Stella gets tough and starts on her downward trend , Kay , with her patrician beauty and educated accent , can't do it . A very talky movie , supposedly set in England , but the atmosphere and language aren't very British . Apparently the play she appears in has something to do with Caligula - trust me , it's no starmaking play or performance . It was fun to see that the play actually had an orchestra , a reminder of the old days when " straight plays " were really huge events .
Tragic use of big bucks to make a big ripoff	98 minutes of fake-looking special effects and sheer dreck comprise " Poseidon , " a 2006 movie hoping for people trying to get in out of the heat and into an air-conditioned theater . It was commented by an observant viewer on the board for " San Francisco " that Hollywood has lost the art of the buildup , the point being that the big earthquake in " San Francisco " didn't occur until the last portion of the film . The film spent its time building up the characters and situations , all heading toward that fateful day . Ditto " In Old Chicago . " Nowadays , when writers attempt to build a story , it's usually written in too slow a fashion . A great example of a film where this WASN'T the case was " Match Point , " written by the brilliant Woody Allen - but you'll have to really look to find another film like that . Producers won't even consider a script that doesn't get to the point in the first 10 minutes . In " Poseidon , " Hollywood has reached a new low - and who knew it could sink any lower ? We have stock characters given one or two lines to explain their characters . I'm not sure why any of them bothered . There was absolutely no way to care about them . Why not just start with the ship sinking ? This was a movie about special effects , nothing more . Why pretend otherwise . Some of the special effects were quite exciting on the big screen , so I gave it a 5 . I can't comment on the performances . There weren't any . P . S . I was told - and I don't know if this is true - that if a ship the size of the Poseidon sinks , and you're anywhere near it on a lifeboat , the undertow drags you down with it . Not that anyone was going for accuracy here .
thanks for nothing , Colonel Parker	Poor Elvis . He was advised to do Midnight Cowboy , Barbra wanted him for A Star is Born - but thanks to the Colonel , his last screen appearance was Change of Habit , so he could complete his contract with the studio . Elvis , it seems , lost a bet with the devil . Actually , the film is quite pleasant with a familiar and competent cast . Mary Tyler Moore comes off the worst - - we know she's an excellent actress but this role is impossible - eyes heavenward , she resists Elvis ' advances as she has her Crisis of Faith . Great to see a young Jane Elliot before her soap opera days . Elvis does fine , he always does . He looks good and sounds great . And as much as this film has been made fun of , it has more dignity than Harem Scarum or some of the others . What a shame - Elvis had more acting talent than was ever mined , and , had he been challenged , would have lived up to it .
Real life is a bore	Two big kicks to be had out of " The Tattooed Stranger " for this viewer - spotting Patricia Barry , even though back then , she had another name and different colored hair ; and seeing Jack Lord in an uncredited role . When those are the big whoops , you've got a problem . This is a B movie that concentrates on routine police work to uncover the identity of a woman's dead body found in Central Park and later , her killer . Bette Davis once said , " Real drama is larger than life . " How right she was . This film is life in all of its step-by-step boredom . By the time there's anything to get excited about , it's too late . The cast is pretty blah , but the police detectives manage to show the camaraderie that people working together have , so the director had some idea of what he was doing . The script mentions and shows some New York locations and even shows two officers going into the 8th Avenue subway . Having lived in New York , that was fun . Today we have reality TV where the " real people " are a lot looser than these actors who were trying to be real . Very so-so .
Behind the scenes of a tabloid	It's too early to really judge " Dirt " yet . Based on the pilot , it's sleazy as hell and has no likable characters . Of course , F / X is an expert at this kind of thing and just might make it a go . The star is Courtney Cox as Lucy , the editor of " Dirt " and " Now " magazines . She's a cold bitch who wants whatever slime she can get on celebrities - all of whom are painted as young , on drugs , having sex in restaurants , and cheating on their spouses and significant others . Frankly , when Don the schizophrenic ( the only character I actually liked and felt sorry for ) gets their revealing photos , it's kind of hard to have pity on any of them . At the end of the show , the writers tried to flesh out the Lucy character a bit , showing her as a lonely woman who seems to care about Don the schizophrenic . Not sure I bought it , since I'd just seen her use a stun gun on someone she slept with , as she suspects he only went to bed with her because he knows who she is and wanted his CD promoted . Cox looks gorgeous . The acting ranges from okay to lousy . There are lots of new young faces , and one suspects that the budget went for other things . " Dirt " gives the audience a very dim view of Hollywood , celebrities , and the tabloids that basically is what the mainstream media has been telling us for years . Everyone is Paris , Britney , Nicole , Justin ; no one practices safe sex ; and everyone uses drugs . It's all kind of sick . Is there an audience for it ? Most likely .
pleasant with an interesting cast	This Hallmark movie , although it got quite a bit of structure from the " Perry Mason " TV movies , was slow but pleasant , with several plot turns that could be seen coming from a foot away . What it had going for it was its cast , including John LaRoquette , William McNamara , and a totally unrecognizable Daryl Anderson , aka " The Animal " from the old Lou Grant Show . Newcomer singer / actress Jamie Ray Newman ( formerly of General Hospital ) had a nice role , and long-time character actor Rod McCarron made an appearance . Nicest of all , two women of a certain age , Marta Dubois and Diane Robin , get to flirt shamelessly with LaRoquette . Dubois is a regular in this series and a love interest of McBride's - good to see an age-matched couple . There was some heart , too , as evidenced when McBride inherits Jessie , a client's dog . All in all , it's refreshing to see that these old-fashioned , purely entertaining types of mysteries with recognizable casts have a home on Hallmark . I look forward to another installment .
Precode film with good performances	The plot of " Illicit " is similar to the plot of an early Bette Davis film called " Ex-Lady " made two years after this one . They should be similar - Edith Fitzgerald wrote both of them . " Ex-Lady " was based on an unproduced play , and " Illicit " actually was a play . Both concern women who don't want to get married and men who do . Anne ( Stanwyck ) ( like Davis ) is an unconventional free spirit afraid that marriage will destroy the romance she has with Dick ( James Rennie ) . However , word gets around that the two have been weekending in Connecticut , and Dick's father ( Claude Gillingwater ) convinces her to agree to marry Dick . Thanks to an old girlfriend of Dick's and an old beau of Anne's , trouble brews in paradise once the rings are exchanged . This is an early sound film , so the rhythm is off , and some of the sound has an echo . However , a few pauses that are a little too long don't really impede the fine acting . Stanwyck is wonderful and gives indication of the wonderful star she will become . She's funny , vivacious , and likable . Charles Butterworth plays a drunken friend very convincingly , and Claude Gillingwater is dignified yet warm as Dick's father . Rennie makes an attractive lover turned husband for Stanwyck . Joan Blondell has a small role as a friend . The film is interesting because it's early Stanwyck , but also because of the independent woman angle which soon will fade from view with the ushering in of the code . Once the ' 40s hit , the independent woman became an uptight career woman wearing a tailored suit , her hair up , and sporting a stern attitude . Young , carefree non-virgins became a thing of the past . But these precode films are what helped mold the strong images of Katharine Hepburn , Bette Davis , and Barbara Stanwyck and are worth watching .
okay	" Ring of Passion " is a 1978 TV-movie about the Joe Louis / Max Schmeling fights . It stars Bernie Casey as Joe Louis , Stephen Macht as Schemling , Britt Ekland as Mrs . Schmeling , and Allen Garfield as Damon Runyon . The Louis / Schmeling fights , which took place during the time of Hitler , had political implications as well as implications in the international fight arena . Though Schmeling was used by the Third Reich as a symbol of Nazi power , he was not a Nazi . He was , however , a proud German . Louis was an ambitious young man who wasn't very practical with his money . Both were very good men . Both were dynamos in the ring . Their 1938 rematch was considered America vs . Germany . Though not covered in the film , the two became very good friends , with Schmeling helping Louis financially throughout the years . Schmeling died at the age of 99 in 2005 ; Louis died in 1981 . The Brown Bomber , as he was known , held the world heavyweight title longer than anyone . " Ring of Passion " has the stamp of a ' 70s TV movie . The performances are good , but the dialogue is uninspired and the pace is slow . Also , it was strange to see Germans in Germany speaking English with a German accent , which of course , they don't do . However , Stephen Macht , whose last name is German , sports an excellent German accent . One historically incorrect thing : Schmeling and a tennis friend , Rodney , visit together . Rodney is about to play Don Budge , the American tennis champion . When he loses , Rodney and his family disappear . " Rodney " is undoubtedly Roderick Menzel , who indeed lost to Don Budge in 1938 ; however , he died in 1987 . Apparently , in this movie , with the exception of Louis and Schmeling , if the real-life people were still alive , their names were changed ( including Mrs . Schmeling , Anny , called Amy in the film ) .
predictable B film	Frances Gifford gets mixed up in " The Arnelo Affair , " a 1947 film also starring George Murphy , John Hodiak , Eve Arden and Dean Stockwell . In fact , the film was on TCM as part of Dean Stockwell's birthday . He certainly was an adorable little boy . Gifford plays Anne Parkson , the neglected wife of a successful attorney , Ted Parkson ( Murphy ) . One night , Ted brings home a shady client , Tony Arnelo ( Hodiak ) , who owns a nightclub . Arnelo has an immediate attraction to Anne and , upon learning that she has dabbled in room design , he invites her to decorate his club . Of course , he couldn't care less if his club ever gets decorated or not . Though Anne hasn't yet said " yes , " he gives her a key to his place after their first meeting and invites her back the next day at 2 . She arrives the next day and is confronted by an actress-girlfriend of Tony's . Tony slaps the woman and the frightened Anne runs away , the compact that her husband gave her falling out of her purse . The next day , she sees in the paper that the woman has been killed . In exchange for the compact and a letter he later steals , Tony wants Anne . This is a good-looking film , with beautifully tailored mens suits on Hodiak and Murphy and smashing clothes for Gifford and Eve Arden , who owns her own dress shop . And that's about it . The dialogue is totally predictable - when Anne asks her husband to go away with her , the words were out of my mouth 30 seconds before she said the line . The attractive Gifford is a bore and gives no shading to her role at all . MGM never could figure out what to do with Laraine Day - why didn't she make this ? Murphy has a pleasant way about him and Hodiak is okay , but frankly , Dean Stockwell as Anne's son steals that show . That's not saying much . Eve Arden is good but wasted . The music is overpowering , and the pacing is slow . " The Arnelo Affair " needed a strong actress in the lead , better dialogue and faster pacing . Without those elements , it's pretty dull .
pre-code youths in Paris	It was said , possibly by David Niven , that Constance Bennett would walk into a room at night to play cards and emerge the next morning looking exactly the same as when she went in . I can believe it . Her beauty , glamor , and freshness are beautifully showcased in " The Common Law " about living and loving ( freely ) in Paris . It seems strange that a movie made in 1931 should seem more modern than later films , but we can thank the Hayes code for that . In The Common Law , Bennett , when she's not shacking up with some guy , is a model for an artist , played by boyish Joel McCrea . The two fall in love , go through a breakup and reconcile . She is reticent about getting married . Then McCrea's conniving sister , having heard all the rumors , lures both she and McCrea back to America . McCrea and Bennett made several films together , and they are a beautiful couple . He's big and wholesome ; she's delicate and sophisticated . And of course , they're both incredibly beautiful . It's always interesting to catch a pre-code movie , and The Common Law is a good one .
A woman comes between two best friends	" Manpower " is a 1941 Warner Brothers film directed by Raoul Walsh . Walsh said that Jack Warner used to call him to his office and say , " You have to direct this film for me . " Walsh would ask , " Who's in it ? " " Oh , I don't know , " Warner would moan . One wonders if " Manpower " was one of those films , though it would be pretty hard to forget that you had a film with Marlene Dietrich scheduled . The story is that of a typical love triangle . Hank ( Robinson ) and Johnny ( Raft ) are linemen ; Hank falls hard for Dietrich , who works at a clip joint . He proposes and though she tells him up front that she doesn't love him , she accepts . Then she finds herself in love with Johnny . Dietrich is stunningly beautiful though I was distracted by a wig that seemed to overpower her face . And when was the last time you heard her described , as Raft does , as " just a dame ? " Hardly . She is very good as Fay , who , while she gives it a go with Hank , wants her chance at real happiness . Robinson , who could play pathetic like nobody's business , gives us a pretty pathetic Hank here - injured so that instead of working on the power lines , he's now a manager , unlucky in love and dumpy looking . For a guy who could play mean as dirt , he portrayed these blustery , insecure men very well . Raft is a very dapper Johnny , a nice contrast to Robinson . With the exception of an exciting ending , there really isn't anything exceptional about " Manpower " except the cast and the fact that it rains a lot . Definitely worth seeing for the unique casting .
Lea's energy and charm drives this one .	I enjoy the Hallmark Mystery Movie series , and " Jane Doe " is my favorite , due to the vivacious Lea Thompson , who brings a bright spirit to this " Scarecrow and Mrs . King " type formula of " mom is a government agent . " Thompson has quit the CSA but , like Al Pacino in " The Godfather II , " just when she thought she was out , they dragged her back in . This time , by some high quality technical techniques , the Declaration of Independence , is stolen while on display at a bank . Lea's old partner , played by Joe Penny , needs her help . She is thwarted by his current partner , a nervous woman who feels that her territory is being threatened . Let's face it - the Thompson character doesn't want the job - a false note in this for me was the fact that she continued on the case with such a difficult woman . Thompson wears three hats , that of a loving mother , an employee for a game company , and the occasional agent work . Her husband , Billy Moses , is in the dark about her return to the agency . So there are a few more layers in this series than in the other two . This particular series has more spark than the other two but probably less substance . The villain here was obvious in the first few minutes , and the way the crime was carried out had a very " Mission : Impossible " - - emphasis on the impossible , feel to it . Nevertheless , Thompson is darling and , with a strong leading man in Penny , " Jane Doe " offers a nice break from reality shows .
early Hopkins and McCrea	Miriam Hopkins was an excellent Broadway actress who found a wonderful career in films , even if she never achieved legendary status . In this 1934 movie , she plays the richest woman in the world , undoubtedly a take-off on Barbara Hutton . Desiring to find a man who can love her for herself and not her money , she and her secretary switch identities when there's a potential suitor around . The game gets dicey when Hopkins meets the man of her dreams , Joel McCrea , and let's face it , he was the man of many women's dreams - tall , handsome , boyish , and athletic . The story continues from there with the usual mix-ups . As one of the posters pointed out , the secretary , played by the beautiful Fay Wray , is a married woman , which means that Hopkins is actually posing as a married woman and Wray as a single one - this is a long way of saying the film was probably released before the code hit . Hopkins and McCrea made a good duo , and good thing , because they appeared together several times . This is a pleasant and short comedy , worth seeing for its stars and ' 30s ambiance .
The Fox in Georgia	Red Skelton and Ann Rutherford are " Whistling in Dixie " in this 1942 programmer also starring Guy Kibbee and Rags Ragland ( in a dual role ) . Skelton played the role of Wally Benton a couple of times . On radio , Benton is " The Fox , " a detective , but in his private life he gets dragged into real mysteries as well . This one is at the behest of a friend of his fiancé's ( Rutherford ) who asks them to come to Georgia to investigate a murder . There are some funny moments in this film , but it's rather silly , with a lot of corny jokes , funny faces from Skelton and slapstick . Actually Skelton is much better when he's straightforward - he comes off as sweet , sincere and natural . Some of the supporting cast has the worst southern accents I've ever heard . It's hard to blame them , though , because these types of films were made very quickly . I'm sure they had no dialect coach . However , the horrible accents were very distracting . Okay , but " The Fox " isn't one of my favorite detectives .
pretty good	Crystal Bernard is " As Good as Dead " in this 1995 film written and directed by Larry Cohen . Before the day of home computers , Larry Cohen's grammar school-aged daughter had to write a short report . Mr . Cohen used the typing agency where I worked to type his scripts . So on a Sunday , I took a cab to his beautiful home in New York City , got the hand-printed paper , went home , typed it , got in a cab and brought the typed paper back . We also typed a couple of scripts for him in the office . He would dictate them and take on the accent or emotion of the characters . I've followed his prolific career with great interest . In " As Good as Dead , " Bernard plays Susan Warfield , who works in an office . She takes a hep , sick young woman , Nicole ( Traci Lords ) to the hospital and gives the desk her own insurance card so that Nicole can be treated . Otherwise , they would have to go to the county hospital . Susan tells her office she has to have surgery ( as Nicole does ) and then takes off on vacation so as not to run into anyone she knows . When she returns , Nicole , assumed to be Susan , is unexpectedly dead ; Susan's apartment has been cleared out , and her job is gone . The strangest part of it is that a half-brother that Susan isn't aware she has made all the arrangements . Susan has no choice but to move into Nicole's apartment and wear Nicole's trendy , too short clothes until she can find out why Nicole died and who this mysterious half-brother is . This is actually quite an interesting film , very Lifetime , very TV movie , but entertaining with good performances . Bernard is likable , Lords is Lords , and Judge Reinhold does very well as an attractive man who becomes part of Nicole's ( Susan's ) life . Mr . Cohen's daughter is undoubtedly married now with children of her own . Though this film was made in 1995 , he is still very active as a writer . Thanks to the computer , I'm still typing .
The Prince and the Showgirl	Certainly the giggly prepubescent females who flocked to the movies in the 1930s just loved this silly comedy starring the Queen of the Ice , Sonja Henie and up and coming matinée idol Tyrone Power . " Thin Ice " skates on a pretty thin script but has some standout ice numbers by Henie . While some of her skating positions and landings look awkward compared to today's skaters , she was a consummate performer and a dazzling skater - fast , with amazing spins and great dance moves . She is responsible for the ice show in this country , the creation of skating costumes rather than dresses , for combining ice skating and dance , for making skating popular , and for of all things - white skates , which flew off the shelves when audiences first saw her skate in them ! The threadbare plot consists of a pact between countries , a prince disguised as a vacationer at a European ski resort , and lots of misunderstandings . Power sports two Groucho Marx-type disguises in the course of the film . Though Zanuck did not want to waste his new leading man in such a weak comedy concocted for Sonja's skating , Henie , who was having an affair with Power , insisted on him as her costar . When Zanuck said no , she told him , not too politely , to teach Shirley Temple her skating routines and left the studio . She got her way finally , as she would throughout her entire life . Probably 22 when " Thin Ice " was filmed , Tyrone Power was flawlessly pretty . It would be a couple of years before his looks matured to the point where he would be so spectacularly handsome that this viewer's jaw would drop at the mere sight of him . But I can imagine his effect in 1936-1937 on teens . I saw a photo on ebay recently of Power and Henie , sitting side by side , holding hands and talking to the director between takes of this movie . ( According to screenwriter Milton Sperling , they couldn't get the two of them onto the set from Henie's dressing room , and when they finally did , " Power looked like he was going to collapse . " ) If I'd been Sonja , I'd have had my clutches in him as well . She was as smart as she was talented . As an added plus , there are two ridiculous numbers by Joan Davis , who was always worth watching . For those who remember " I Married Joan , " it's a delight to see her as the leader of a female orchestra in this . Take " Thin Ice " for the entertainment value that it has and enjoy it .
Adaptation of a John O'Hara novel	Suzanne Pleshette has " A Rage to Live " in this 1965 potboiler also starring Bradford Dillman , Ben Gazzara , Linden Chiles , Carmen Matthews , Bethel Leslie and Peter Graves . The film is an adaptation of a John O'Hara novel , and I understand from people who have read the book that it's not a very good one . Pleshette plays Grace Caldwell , a young woman who feels validated and loved only when she's having sex . After an incident with a boy in her home town , Grace's mother ( Matthews ) suffers a heart attack . The two take a vacation , where Grace takes up with a waiter . While she's with him one night , her mother has a fatal heart attack and dies . Eventually Grace meets Sidney Caldwell ( Dillman ) . They fall in love , and Grace confesses her misdeeds to him ; he wants to marry her . They have a son , and for three years , all is well . Then construction worker Roger Bannon arrives to work on the Caldwell property and admits to Grace that he's always wanted her . The two have an affair , which Grace ends , only to have Roger beat up a hooker and call her Grace and talk about what a slut she is before he's killed in a car accident . Sidney finds out and wants to end the marriage ; she talks him into giving her one more chance . Then she's publicly accused of having an affair with an old friend ( Graves ) by his wife ( Leslie ) , which isn't true . The end of this film is not very satisfying . We are led to believe that Grace is finished . She probably is - after that public humiliation , it's doubtful Sidney will want to continue the marriage . However , certainly he is assured by the Graves character that nothing went on between him and Grace . So in the end , Grace is doomed because of something she didn't do . Suzanne Pleshette hit Hollywood about ten years too late - she would have had a chance to become a major star before the studios dissolved . She was beautiful with a gorgeous figure , a sexy voice and one other attribute - she was a wonderful , honest actress . Her big career would be in television , and it was a good one , but nothing like she could have had . Here she rises above some overblown material to give a strong , sympathetic performance . The rest of the cast is good . Bethel Leslie as the alcoholic Amy Hollister has some good scenes as Peter Graves ' insecure and unreasonable wife . Ben Gazzara does a fine job with an off-the-wall , obsessive character . In the book , Sidney dies before he can divorce Grace , and Grace moves away . I suppose having her cry in the middle of the road was more effective . " A Rage to Live " is good to see for Pleshette and for the way an explicit subject matter was handled in the ' 50s . With a lesser actress in the lead , it might have seemed very campy .
When the child is the abuser	This is an interesting movie starring Delta Burke , one of my favorites , and Ryan Merriman , who does an excellent job as a teenager who turns on his mother . Burke is divorced from a verbally abusive and belittling man , and she has custody of their two children . The older boy becomes less and less able to cope with his emotions and begins to act violently against his mother . He's jealous of a man she's seeing , he has anger issues over the divorce , and in his father , there's an excellent role model to blame his mother . She can't handle him so she covers for him by lying . This leads to a near fatality . Merriman plays a boy who's obviously a good albeit extremely troubled kid , and Burke is excellent as a frustrated and helpless mother . It's an all too typical situation today , unfortunately . The film handles the issues well , especially by pointing out that the boy's behavior was not learned overnight , and it won't go away instantly either . Fairly absorbing , and I always love seeing Delta .
A haunted house , an unlucky number	A very young Ginger Rogers stars in " The Thirteenth Guest , " a 1932 film also starring Lyle Talbot . Thirteen years earlier , a dinner party took place in an old house , but the 13th guest never appeared . Now the owner of the house is dead and left his estate to this 13th guest . Someone is murdering the original party guests and putting each dead body in his or her original seat at the table . Rogers plays Marie Morgan , whom we think has been murdered early on . It turns out that it was someone else whose face was altered to look like hers . Detective Phil Winston ( Talbot ) investigates the situation . This is a good haunted house mystery , but unfortunately suffers from a terrible print and bad sound . Nevertheless it's fun to see Ginger and Talbot , both of whom are very good . If you can tolerate the print , you'll enjoy it .
Good acting and gritty atmosphere the stars of this film	Mickey Rourke is " The Pope of Greenwich Village " in this 1984 film also starring Eric Roberts , Geraldine Page , Kenneth McMillan , Darryl Hannah and Burt Young . Rourke is Charlie , who , with his cousin Paulie , rob a mobster with the help of a safecracker ( McMillan ) . Both Rourke and Roberts are in fine form against the New York background . Everything about this film is seedy . The detectives all look out of shape and overtired , everybody has smoker's skin or a drinker's red nose . As Charlie , Rourke wants a big score so he can buy a restaurant , but his fatal flaw is listening to his idiotic cousin Paulie , a total loser and a weakling , who gets him involved in the robbery of a vicious mobster where a cop is killed at the scene . The attractive Rourke uses his sweet smile to good advantage and underplays ; it's a shame he underwent such severe plastic surgery and took his career off track . Roberts plays Paulie as completely pathetic , so pathetic that at times , he's funny , even when his circumstances aren't . The mob movies were in their heyday when " The Pope of Greenwich Village " was made , so it probably got lost in the shuffle . It's not a big film , but the acting and locations are impressive . Look for Geraldine Page in a small but showy role as the dead cop's mother , a woman who can handle the police better than anyone .
British psychological drama	Ann Harding is a young girl who must take off " The Seventh Veil , " referring to the last veil of Salome , in this 1945 psychological drama also starring James Mason and Herbert Lom . Harding plays Francesca , who becomes the word of Nicholas ( Mason ) , a friend of her father's , when she is a young girl . Learning of her musical talent , Nicholas molds her into a first-class concert pianist , and she launches on a career . All the while , she is completely under his control . When she fell in love with a jazz musician , Nicholas took her to Paris to study . Once her career is in full bloom and she is of age , she falls in love with an artist and runs away with him . A terrible accident hospitalizes her , and after a suicide attempt , a psychiatrist ( Lom ) begins to work with her , as she now believes she cannot ever play the piano again . This is a very well-done film with excellent performances . Mason is passive , mysterious and intimidating as Nicholas , a man who also has an edge of violence when pushed too hard . There is a scene where he stands backstage and watches Francesca play the piano ; his face softens as he smiles , and the character reveals more of himself . As Francesca , the pretty Harding has the right mix of submission and then passion when she needs it . Lom , ever the chameleon , does a wonderful job as the psychiatrist . The music played by Francesca throughout the film is fantastic as is the somewhat dreary atmosphere in which Francesca lives . The ending is too abrupt but also in a way satisfying . One hopes that both Francesca and Nicholas are on their way to becoming whole people . Highly recommended .
Two tragic stars in a delightful fantasy	There were many beautiful women during Hollywood's golden years , but only a small percentage would qualify as goddesses . Rita Hayworth was definitely one of that elite group , possibly never more stunningly beautiful as she appeared in " Down To Earth . " As Terpsichore , goddess of music and dance , she comes to earth to star - - and correct - - a Broadway show about Terpsichore . Several characters from " Here Comes Mr . Jordan " appear , with Roland Culver taking the Claude Rains ' role of Mr . Jordan . Larry Parks plays the producer-director-star , Danny Miller , who has to pay off a gambling debt with this show or die . Though the music isn't that memorable , the story is charming , and the film contains a lovely performance and great dancing by Hayworth ( whose voice is dubbed by Anita Ellis ) , and she's given excellent support by James Gleason , Culver , and Edward Everett Horton . Larry Parks , fresh from his star-making role in " The Jolson Story " does a good job but one wonders , had he not been blacklisted , what would have happened to his career . He wasn't a particularly strong leading man . But we'll never know , because a few years later , he was finished . As for Hayworth , it's a shame that someone so incredibly beautiful and vivacious , who brought so much happiness through her work , could have had such a miserable life - abuse by her father , a string of bad marriages , and finally Alzheimer's . It was her Alzheimer's that helped to bring the disease to national attention . Princess Yasmin Khan , Hayworth's daughter , has become an internationally known spokeswoman and active fund-raiser to increase awareness and finance research to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease . Besides her glorious presence , Rita had one more gift for the world .
okay romance	Ida Lupino is in love with Errol Flynn but Errol loves his brother's fiancé in " Escape Me Never , " a 1947 film from Warner Brothers . Flynn and Gig Young play brother composers Sebastian and Caryl Dubrok . Lupino plays Gemma , a poor young woman with a baby she calls Piccolo . She's in love with Flynn , and tells the beautiful , well-bred Fionella ( Eleanor Parker ) , Caryl's fiancé , that she's going to marry the composer Dubrok . Parker thinks it's Caryl and takes off . Carly , Gemma , Piccolo , and Sebastian set off to find her , singing and playing instruments for money as they go . Once they find Fionella , she falls for Flynn and vice versa . This movie is a remake of a film starring Elizabeth Bergner , and I have no idea why Warners chose it . The performances are good , with Flynn very handsome and charming , though signs of seediness were beginning to show . He plays a self-involved playboy with no practicality very well . Young has a somewhat thankless role as the less flashy brother . Lupino gives a sympathetic portrayal , though she's slightly miscast . The character is feisty but also more of an ingénue than Lupino , whose strong appearance and voice made her a leading lady almost out of the box . Unfortunately because she was at Warners , she had to take a back seat to Bette Davis much of the time . She had more in her than this role requires . Parker is excellent as a cool but lovely socialite . There's some great music by Wolfgang Korngold of Sebastian's opera " Primavera , " and some nice dancing . All in all , it's a small film that used sets rather than location . Not a great entry but some lovely moments from the stars .
entertaining if preposterous	This good looking film harkens back to the old-fashioned movies of the late ' 30s and ' 40s . Though predictable and not believable , it manages to be very entertaining and keeps one's interest . It would have been a little more believable for me if the Melanie Griffith character hadn't had to drag Liam Neeson's kids around with her everywhere . They most certainly would have told their father of their adventures .
Fun and love in the Catskills	Ginger Rogers is Thelma , a secretary seeking rest and relaxation at a Catskill resort in " Having Wonderful Time , " also starring Douglas Fairbanks , Jr . , Lee Bowman , Eve Arden , Jack Carson , Lucille Ball and Michael ( Red ) Skelton . Uptight Rogers arrives at the resort and gets off on the wrong foot with Chick , a law student working as a waiter ( Fairbanks ) . Eventually they discover they really like each other , but when Thelma expects a proposal from Chick , she gets a proposition instead and blows her stack . On the rebound , she picks up with fast Buzzy ( Bowman ) , who's been staked out by Miriam ( Ball ) . Complications arise . " Having Wonderful Time " is light entertainment that has nothing special about it except its talented young cast . Rogers is fine as the more serious , less flirtatious woman in a group of love-mad girls . Fairbanks is fantastic , using a completely different persona from other films ? he sports an American accent and comes across as a brusque handsome hunk rather than a British gentleman . Eve Arden's New York accent is over the top but she's funny as a resort guest , and comedy and slapstick are provided by pretty Lucille Ball and Red Skelton , who gets to do a couple of comedy routines . All in all good fun from RKO and recommended .
An exciting discovery	The silent era continues to have surprises for us , such as this one , " Beyond the Rocks , " a film starring Gloria Swanson and Rudolph Valentino once thought lost but since rediscovered and restored . Based on a novel by Elinor Glyn , it's a potboiler that doesn't hold up well today , but so little does at age 84 . It's the story of a young woman , Theodora , the hope of her family ( i . e . , the one with the youth and looks to nab a rich husband ) who meets a British nobleman ( Valentino ) when he saves her from drowning . Then she meets her betrothed , a short , old thing . She's disappointed , but for the sake of her father , marries him . She runs into Valentino on her honeymoon and this time , he saves her from falling off a mountain during a climbing expedition . They seem Meant to Be . But both are determined to honor her marriage vows . Valentino and Swanson are heavily made up , and both actually looked much better with a more natural appearance . In the beginning , with her hair down and less Max Factor , Swanson is lovely - petite , with amazing eyes and beautiful skin . Later on , however , she looks older than she is due to the make-up and hair-do . Her character has a great wardrobe , and Swanson wears it well . Both actors give good performances . Valentino had a tendency to be obvious in some of his emotions - it was more the style then - but he gives a more relaxed performance in " Beyond the Rocks . " Most of the movie looks beautiful with its sepia tones though there are some damaged sections . It's quite a find and a chance to see two big stars of the silent era together . Swanson wrote of parts of the film that don't seem to exist any longer - but as one of the comments here suggests , she perhaps was mixing this up with another film . Given the plot , it would be easy to do so .
A Boston patriarch in 1912 finds times they are a-changin '	Ronald Colman is " The Late George Apley " in this 1947 film based on a Philip Barry play , also starring Richard Ney , Peggy Cummins , Edna Best , Richard Haydn , Vanessa Brown , and Mildred Natwick . Apley is a stuffed shirt whose well-ordered family is suddenly not so well-ordered . His son ( Richard Ney ) is dating a girl from Worcester , which is seen by Apley as being someplace like the Black Hole of Calcutta , and his daughter ( Cummins ) loves a Yale man who lectures that Emerson was a radical . At first , George takes a firm stand , then relents at the behest of his understanding friend , who saw George give up the woman he loved 30 years earlier . When the Worcester girl's father actually rejects the Apley family , George rethinks his position . His daughter is sent to Europe to get away from her boyfriend , and his son is betrothed to his cousin ( Brown ) . Imagine going to Broadway shows in the ' 20s and ' 30s and attending one class-conscious play after another . Before the Depression , the sets were drawing rooms , the clothing was formal , everyone had British accents , and the plots had to do with the crossing of the classes . Frankly , I'm glad they finally intermingled . Ronald Colman is marvelous as George , and one sees his confusion , pain , and remembrance of the past on his face . He's a very sympathetic character . Peggy Cummins is very pretty and Richard Ney is nice-looking . Vanessa Brown , as the dowdy cousin , gives a sweet performance , and her story arc is very satisfying . If you're a fan of Ronald Colman , as I am , this is a good movie to see . Also , if you know Boston at all , you'll find hearing the street names interesting . Otherwise , it's a mildly interesting period piece that most people will find relating to difficult .
cute Hope comedy	Bob Hope is mistaken for a detective in " My Favorite Brunette , " a comedy from 1947 costarring Dorothy Lamour and Peter Lorre . The film begins with Ronnie Jackson ( Hope ) making wisecracks as he sits on death row . He's visited by reporters whom he tells his whole story in flashback . A baby photographer who desperately wants to become a partner to the detective down the hall , Sam ( Alan Ladd in a cameo ) , Ronnie gets his chance when a lady in distress ( Lamour ) visits Sam's office while he's away . Ronnie pretends he's Sam and before you know it , he's in all kinds of trouble , running from a gang of thugs that includes Peter Lorre and Lon Chaney who are looking for a map . This is an entertaining comedy with good performances all around . Lon Chaney , Jr . is particularly funny as a strong man / imbecile . Besides Ladd , there's another cameo as well that adds to the fun . I like these light comedies of Hope's but confess to liking " My Favorite Blonde " better . This is still good , with the exotic-looking Lamour an able costar - and let's face it , as Hope's costar , she'd had a lot of experience .
Cute send-up of TV western stars and ad men	" Callaway Went Thataway " is a slight comedy enlivened by some fine performances by Dorothy McGuire , Fred MacMurray , Howard Keel and Jesse White . As television was threatening to take over the film industry , MGM produced this send-up of the TV western hero craze . Smoky Callaway's old movies are being run on TV and are such a hit with kids that an enormous licensing potential develops for Smoky products and endorsements , plus the making of more Smoky movies . One small problem - Smoky done left the corral 10 years earlier and no one - including his agent ( White ) knows where he went . The ad agency partners ( McGuire and MacMurray ) find a lookalike , Stretch Barnes , a simple man with simple needs , and convince him to take Smoky's place , claiming that Smoky is dead . All goes well until Smoky's agent finds the real Callaway , a womanizing boozer , and brings him back . This is a fun film for baby boomers who grew up with Gabby Hayes , Roy Rogers , The Cisco Kid , The Lone Ranger , Roy Rogers etc . etc . and who used all the products that carried their hero's face : the cereals , the lunch boxes , the toys . Howard Keel is terrific in the dual role of sweet , sensitive , aw shucks ma'm Stretch and the hard-drinking slob Smoky . McGuire is lovely in her role , and MacMurray does well as her less conscience-stricken partner . MGM takes the opportunity to plug its stars - there are cameos of Esther Williams , Elizabeth Taylor , and Clark Gable , and there are lots of future TV stars as well . Besides Jesse White , there's Stan Frieberg , Natalie Schaeffer , and in an uncredited role , Hugh Beaumont . Fun viewing .
Saturday afternoon at the movies	Piper Laurie said of Tyrone Power , " Tyrone Power was Saturday afternoon at the movies . " " Son of Fury " surely must have been one of those films that young people flocked to see on a Saturday afternoon - an island adventure starring one of the biggest stars in Hollywood . Power costars with a great cast that includes George Sanders , Frances Farmer , Gene Tierney , Roddy McDowell , and Elsa Lanchester . Tierney is impossibly beautiful , certainly every boy's dream girl - and on an island , no less , and not speaking English ! Her final kiss with Power is socko . The film has some excellent performances by the supporting cast , McDowell and Lanchester in particular . Lanchester's scene with Power is especially touching . Fifteen years later , they'd work together on his last film , Witness for the Prosecution . Lovely Farmer , whose story is now legend , doesn't have much to do , which is a shame . Sanders is always excellent . He and Power would fight on screen again in " Solomon and Sheba . " Power collapsed while he and Sanders rehearsed a sword fight and died very shortly afterward . Son of Fury , of course , is the type of film at which Power excelled , and there would be many more period pieces to come before his contract , interrupted by the war , finally expired . He said at the end of his life that he was proud of only four films . He should have been prouder of a lot more , because he fed a lot of dreams and was responsible for many happy Saturday afternoons for 22 years .
Entertaining look at a great studio	" 20th Century Fox : The First 50 Years , " narrated by James Coburn , gives us a history of the studio's dual beginnings , merger , and success as a great Hollywood studio under the aegis of the ambitious Darryl F . Zanuck . There are wonderful clips and homages to some of the stars that made 20th Century Fox great : Will Rogers , Shirley Temple , Tyrone Power , Betty Grable , Henry Fonda , Alice Faye , Don Ameche et al . What's usually missing in these compilations is depth because so much has to be covered , but in this case , they did an okay job . There were also brief comments by stars such as Alice Faye and Roddy McDowell . Of special interest were the early sound tests and a look at the development of Fox's sound system . The early sound clips featured two very young actors , Humphrey Bogart and Spencer Tracy . 20th Century Fox is a particularly fascinating studio because around the late ' 50s , the lunatics started taking over the asylum , the Cleopatra debacle being a great example as well as all the problems with Marilyn Monroe . There are some clips from the film she did not complete , " Something's Gotta Give , " that are great . That fact is , the radiant Monroe was always a problem , as anyone who has ever seen a documentary on Billy Wilder will attest . It's just that once a woman hit 30 in Hollywood - let alone travel down the road past it - the powers that be started to lose patience . The previous poster mentioned the fickleness of trends as demonstrated by this documentary . I submit it's not the fickleness of trends but of the studios who put some of these great stars out to pasture and / or treated them badly after they'd kept the studios solvent . Since 20th Century Fox is the subject , here are a few examples not mentioned . Alice Faye left because of the hatchet job done on her role in the film " Fallen Angel " in favor of Linda Darnell ; there was a small clip shown of " Nightmare Alley , " with no explanation that Tyrone Power pleaded with Zanuck to make it , and when Zanuck saw it , he was so terrified for Power's image that he withdrew it from distribution and never publicized it . Nice way to treat somebody who gave you hit after hit after hit . It also isn't mentioned that after " Marie Antoinette , " Zanuck refused to lend Power out - not for Ashley in " Gone with the Wind , " not for the " The Last Tycoon , " which was as a result not made until many years later , not to Harry Cohn , who was desperate to get him for anything . Linda Darnell was of no use to Zanuck when she got married and couldn't play virginal roles anymore , though to her credit , she staged a sexy comeback . And on and on . Despite its self-serving theme , " 20th Century Fox : The First 50 Years " is interesting and entertaining , though a little long . The producers also could have dug a little deeper for unusual clips and paid a little more attention to the clips that were shown . Not everyone has seen " Laura " - was it necessary to show the murderer ?
Because it's there	Because it's there - well , I suppose that's a good enough reason to climb a mountain . It was motivation enough to climb Everest . However , in " The White Tower " everyone has a different reason for wanting to climb a magnificent mountain peak in the Swiss Alps that defeated the father of Carla Alten ( Valli ) , a young woman whose goal in climbing is closure . Glenn Ford , as Ordway , is finally convinced to take the climb - his goal is Valli . And so it goes , as six climbers start on a ascent to the top . This is a gorgeous Technicolor film that was intended to be seen in a theater . The scenery is magnificent , and the cast of climbers is excellent : Ford , Valli , Claude Rains , Lloyd Bridges , Oscar Homolka , and Cedric Hardwicke . Like Walter Slezak in " Lifeboat , " Bridges plays the Aryan Nazi , Hein , who hasn't forgotten his Fuhrer . He puts himself in competition with Ordway ( Ford ) , the American looking for some post-war peace , and he hates Raines and Homolka for being the " weaklings " who are holding the team back . Rains is an alcoholic writer - he is unhappily married and wants to feel again ; Hardwicke was a friend of Valli's father and wants to support her quest . Homolka is a reluctant guide who goes on the trip in spite of himself . Valli is much more vivacious and outdoorsy than she was in " The Third Man " or " The Parradine Case . " Ford always has such a wonderful quality - shy , with a gentle manner , beautiful smile and that disarming , soft voice - how any woman could resist him is a mystery , though I give Valli credit for trying . He'll be 90 on May 1 , bless his heart . The film has some suspenseful moments and is definitely worth a watch .
And introducing Alan Ladd	Both Alan Ladd and Tyrone Power made their film debuts in 1932's Tom Brown of Culver ; by 1936 , Power was a star . It took Alan Ladd a long 10 years and something like 40 films to make it , but make it he did as a cat-loving contract killer in " This Gun for Hire , " also starring Veronica Lake , Laird Cregar and Robert Preston . Ladd plays Phillip Raven , a contract killer in San Francisco who is hired to " off " a blackmailer and retrieve a formula from him . What he doesn't know is that his employers paid him in marked bills and then reported him to the police as the killer of the man , hoping to get him out of the way . Their plan is to sell the formula to the Germans . A Senate committee is suspicious of one of the traitors , a night-club owner named Willard Gates ( Cregar ) and send in a performer , Ellen Graham ( Lake ) to work undercover for them , unbeknownst to her LA policeman boyfriend ( Preston ) . Graham and Raven are mistakenly connected by Gates , and soon both are on the run from him . " This Gun for Hire " is thickly plotted but nevertheless somehow holds the viewer's interest , most likely because of the characterizations . The diminutive , beautiful Lake is an absolute delight as a singer with a magician routine . As one of the villains , Laird Cregar creates an excellent character - a hugely built fraidy-cat who abhors violence . And Ladd's Phillip Raven , vicious though he is , is a man who learned in childhood not to trust anyone and not to get too close to anyone . He's a sad character - and this is as close to acting from Ladd as you'll get . In future films , he says his lines in a monotone , though his tough guy persona is very effective . Here , he plays a ruthless man given to outbursts as well as depression . His paired with Lake , which perhaps was continued because she was a good height for him , is heaven-sent - these are two noir actors who fit the genre perfectly , if for different reasons . " This Gun for Hire " makes for compelling drama , but it's sad to watch as well . Cregar died two years after the film's release , at the age of 28 , with what would have been a great career lost ; after a failed suicide attempt ( his mother was a suicide ) , Ladd would die of an alcohol and drug overdose at the age of 51 ; and the rage with her peek-a-boo hairdo , Lake , by the ' 50s , would be an alcoholic working as a bartender in a hotel before dying at age 54 . You could say this is a " curse " film , but one can say that about so many - the lives of the people who made these classics just weren't fun . A shame , because they left us with such great work .
Russell and her male secretary	1942's " Take a Letter , Darling " is a fun look at life in the ' 40s , and no one could play a career woman like Rosalind Russell . Tough , intelligent , sophisticated and glamorous , she fits easily into a man's world . In this film , directed by Mitchell Leisen , A . M . MacGregor ( Russell ) is the active partner in an advertising firm with Atwood ( Robert Benchley ) , but she has both man and woman trouble . Men make passes and wives are jealous . To get around this , she hires a male secretary , Tom Verney ( MacMurray ) who in reality is an artist trying to save money to move to Mexico and paint . He takes notes , does research for her and , most importantly , poses as her fiancé at business dinners . Verney is wary of the job from the beginning and plays along reluctantly . When A . M . learns the often-married Jonathan Caldwell ( MacDonald Carey ) is looking for a new advertising company for his tobacco company , she also learns he hates women . She maneuvers a meeting but learns that his sister ( Constance Moore ) has to approve the campaign . Enter Verney - but when the sister turns out to be young , beautiful , and invites Verney to the southern plantation - A . M . finds she's jealous . Good movie , good fun , terrific cast , if somewhat predictable .
Drama based on Arthur Miller's play	" All My Sons " was on Broadway in 1947 and starred Ed Begley Sr . and Arthur Kennedy . It was a timely play , as stories of wartime corruption had started to surface . Considered anticapitalist , it was suspected of being pro-Communist , so the film version is somewhat modified from the play . It stars Edward G . Robinson , Burt Lancaster , Mady Christians , Howard Duff , Louisa Horton , and Arlene Francis . Edward G . Robinson plays Joe , a man who worked hard to build his factory along with his partner , Herbert Deever . During the war , Deever was put on trial and found guilty of shipping cylinders from the factory that he knew were defective , which , when put into planes , caused the deaths of many war pilots . Though Deever claimed that Joe knew about the shipment , he wasn't believed - Joe was home sick at the time the cylinders were sent . Though the cloud remained over Joe , his business stayed highly successful , and he enjoyed a good place in the community . His son , Chris , however , comes home and announces that he wants to marry Deever's daughter Ann - who had been engaged to Chris ' brother Larry , lost during the war and presumed dead . This fact has never been accepted by Chris and Larry's mother ( Christians ) , and Joe is anxious that Chris put aside his idea of marrying Ann . Then Ann's attorney brother calls her from the prison where their father is incarcerated . He believes Joe is guilty and wants to reopen the case . This is a very well acted film that suffers from the miscasting of Edward G . Robinson . Robinson was a magnificent actor but is so obviously guilty , one wonders how he escaped prosecution , especially when one sees the sincerity of Herbert Deever when Chris visits him in prison . The Broadway star , Ed Begley Sr . , had a friendly face and a good deal of warmth ; Robinson is scrappy , defensive , plus he looks like a thug . It was more of a Spencer Tracy role - it called for a more lovable man that you want to believe , doubts to the contrary . Mady Christians , who was blacklisted , is very sympathetic as Joe's wife . Burt Lancaster insisted on this role ; early on , he saw a career as a hunk beginning to take form and fought it . This led to interesting parts for him later on , and he made a great transition to character actor later in life . One can certainly understand the temptation to cast him as a hunk , with his broad shoulders and great build . Lancaster was the whole matinée idol package , right down to his full lips . Apparently the actor knew how handsome he was and was very competitive with other stars of that era , such as Tony Curtis , and like Curtis , he wanted more than romantic leads . Despite its flaws , All My Sons is a strong drama about a son breaking away from his father , the strength of denial , the importance of penance for one's acts and of moving on . A Chinese woman who saw " The Crucible " was certain that Arthur Miller had been in prison in China , so universal was the language of that play . That was Miller's gift , the ability to tell a deeply human story that , politics and social change aside , can still resonate today .
Rhett in China	Even toward the end of his marvelous career , Clark Gable's screen persona of the charming , irresistible bounder was untarnished . Unhappy with the roles MGM was giving him , he did not renew his contract . " Soldier of Fortune , " which Gable subsequently did for 20th Century Fox , is a big budget , good-looking movie with big stars , none of which can hide the fact that it's a routine story that John Hodiak could have done in black and white in 1950 and probably did . Susan Hayward plays a woman who arrives in Hong Kong to look for her photographer husband ( Gene Barry ) who has slipped into China illegally . She runs into of a bunch of sleazy characters and finally meets Henry Lee ( Gable ) , a soldier of fortune with money and contacts . He's an older version of Rhett Butler - out for himself but capable of goodness as well . He falls hard for Hayward and becomes more determined than ever to find her husband so he doesn't have to compete with a ghost . With two such attractive stars , it's obvious what's going to happen . The stars and the supporting cast - Michael Rennie , Tom Tully , Anna Sten et al - are all very good . It's a beautifully photographed film that undoubtedly looked great on the big screen with its Technicolor panoramas of Hong Kong , but alas , it's not very exciting . Gable looks fantastic and immaculate in his white suit , his smile as dimpled and his voice as gruff as ever , and Hayward , not the warmest actress who ever lived , is excellent as a concerned and confused woman . They work very well together . It's hard to say the movie is not worth seeing because as excellent as some of our actors are today , there are no Gables . There was only one - and checking him out is always worthwhile .
rolling in the aisles	This is one of those movies you either get the sensibility of or you just don't . I was laughing out loud so that will tell you where I am . Zoolander is an elaborate skit peppered with music videos and it's hysterical . I love the against type casting of Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson as supermodels and all the cameos are fun . The premise is very funny , as is the total send-up of the modeling business . This is the kind of frothy , mind candy entertainment that we all need once in a while . Take it on that level and you won't be disappointed . The first part of the movie is the funniest ; it falls apart later on and then just becomes stupid . Recommended if you're feeling silly and the thought of Ben Stiller as a model makes you laugh .
Ginger sprung from prison to testify against a mobster	Ginger Rogers is in a " Tight Spot " in this 1955 film directed by Phil Karlsen and also starring Edward G . Robinson , Brian Keith and Lorne Greene . Rogers plays Sherry Conley , in prison for harboring a fugitive . When the big witness against a mobster ( Greene ) is killed , she's asked to be a witness against him so that he can be deported . She realizes the danger , but stalls in making her decision because she's in a hotel and can order room service and take private showers . Also , one of her guards , Vince ( Keith ) is attractive and there appears to be a chemistry there . After a couple of murder attempts , she wants to go back to prison . " Tight Spot " isn't exactly an " A " movie ; it's more like a - it's filmed in black and white and fits into the noir genre . However , it's based on a play , and it's obvious - the scenes aren't opened up at all , and there's a ton of dialogue . It doesn't appear that Karlsen directed either Rogers or Eve McVeagh very well . Both actresses approach their roles as if they're doing them for stage ; the effect is over the top . Ginger Rogers was a wonderful actress and a very versatile one . Like all female film stars , the roles became a little less interesting after she turned 30 and all but disappeared when she turned 40 . She's 44 here , playing someone younger , and she is very effective if a little overdone in parts . Robinson is great as usual , and a young Keith gives a relaxed performance . Greene was cast as a villain often until he played Pa Cartwright . At the age of 45 when the show started , he was 13 years older than Adam Cartwright ( Pernell Roberts ) . After that , he played fathers , and producers didn't care whose father - Ava Gardner's , for instance , in Earthquake . He was seven years older than Ava . He does a good job here in a fairly one-dimensional role . All in all , okay .
Grant at his screwball best	Cary Grant and Ginger Rogers go back to their childhoods in " Monkey Business , " about a youth formula mixed up by a monkey . It's a real ' 30s screwball comedy in the hands of three masters - Howard Hawks , Grant , and Rogers , and the concept is a funny one , even if it does get a bit tedious . Marilyn Monroe is delicious in a supporting role as a secretary who can't type . Hugh Marlowe and Charles Coburn are the straight men - Coburn is the head of the company that wants Grant's formula , except that Grant's formula is worthless . When his back was turned , one of his experimental monkeys mixed up the magic concoction and dropped it in the water cooler . After a glass , Grant becomes a college kid again and takes Monroe on a whirl . Then Rogers uses the water to make coffee . . . It's amazing that Grant was still making these movies twenty years after he started , but he's as agile as ever . This is a fun watch and of great interest because of Monroe .
nice holiday movie	" A Fare to Remember " is a totally derivative , almost ridiculous movie , but has a warmth about it that makes it a very effective and upbeat holiday movie . It stars a pretty newcomer , Challen Kates , as a high-powered ad executive who , right before her wedding , has to rush from L . A . to Seattle to keep a client who has rejected every other presentation . She has transportation difficulties from the beginning and seemingly no money . This is the first dumb thing - were there no ATMs anywhere ? She must make a fortune . At any rate , she meets a cab driver ( Warner ) who looks like a homeless man , and he drives her to her presentation and when she emerges with a huge box of beef jerky ( the client's product ) , he's there to take her to the airport . All flights are canceled , so in order to get to L . A . for her wedding , she hires him to take her there . Along the way , they bond and learn from each other . It's a very sweet movie though there is absolutely nothing new in it - it combines " Six Days and Seven Nights " and a few other films . But the chemistry between the stars is good , they're likable , and the acting is good . Look for Jerry Springer as the head of the beef jerky company and a cameo by Karl Malden . This is a nice film to take in over the holiday season . It's on Lifetime .
A young girl and an orchestra	A young girl forms an orchestra to help her out-of-work father in " 100 Men and a Girl , " a 1937 film starring Deanna Durbin , Adolphe Menjou , Leopold Stokowski , Alice Brady , and Mischa Auer . When Patsy Cardwell returns an evening bag her father found , she winds up at a huge society party where she entrances everyone with her singing . Explaining that her father is an unemployed musician , she gets the idea to form her own orchestra and believes the society matron ( Alice Brady ) when she carelessly agrees to sponsor the orchestra . Many complications ensue , especially when the eminent conductor Leopold Stokowski is sought to lead the new orchestra in concert . It was interesting to read the " Wizard of Oz " comparisons on this page , because Deanna Durbin reminds me of Judy Garland in a way - in this era , they both wore their hair the same way , were both teenagers , and both had mature voices , Durbin of course leaning more toward the classical . To say that Durbin is an energetic actress is an understatement . She's completely hyper , and that high speaking voice only adds to the anxiety level . As Patsy , she is very pretty and sings well . Like all sopranos of that era , she backs off of her high notes , but the middle voice is quite beautiful and as she grows into a young woman , it will become even more so . She does a credible job on Mozart's " Alleluia " and " Libiamo " from " La Traviata " despite some pitch problems . Given her age , these are minor criticisms . She has a great deal of poise , too , for someone so young . The rest of the cast is very good , and Stokowski makes a nice contrast against Durbin as his calm , deliberate and very professional self . " 100 Men and a Girl " is about a determined young woman with an outlandish dream who makes it come true . This isn't a fantasy like " Wizard of Oz , " nor is it very realistic , I suppose , but the way it's presented - well , you just believe it could happen .
A sexier " Phantom " that isn't without its problems	Andrew Lloyd Webber's long-running Broadway show , " The Phantom of the Opera " has been brought to the screen in a sumptuous , lush production . There have been many versions of this tale , dating back to Lon Chaney's scary performance in silent film . In the Claude Rains version , the Phantom seems to have been Christine's father and the victim of a terrible misunderstanding . The reasons for the Phantom's problems always vary , but the bottom line is - this guy is one sandwich short of a picnic due to his face being deformed . He hides away in the sewers of the Paris Opera . In this version , as the " Angel of Music " he has been coaching the beautiful dancer / singer Christine for the day when she will make her opera debut - probably by the Phantom clunking a diva over the head , which is the way it's been done in past films . Minnie Driver is the unfortunate Carlotta , but her life is spared in Webber's Phantom . Driver is hilarious as the temperamental , Italian opera star , and she's perhaps the best thing in the film . You know there's a problem when the Phantom is better looking than Christine's boyfriend , Raoul , which is the case here . Gerard Butler is plenty handsome for a deformed man - he sings in an appropriately rough , desperate manner , and his scenes with Christine are hot . Broadway star Patrick Wilson is a very good Raoul , tender and loving . Emily Rossum is beautiful as Christine . She has a sweet voice , but Webber insists upon these very light , small voices singing Christine ; thus , we lose some of the glorious music - not to mention the words - in the lower registers . Also , it was interesting how her gowns went from demure to Victoria's Secret slutty whenever she wound up with the Phantom . She looked great in everything . The music in Phantom is its best feature , and it's not compromised in this production . For the most part , the score is well sung . The usual problem is that someone with Christine's voice is not an appropriate replacement for a diva with Carlotta's voice - in fact , she's not really appropriate for much opera . It wasn't an issue in this version , as Christine replaces Carlotta singing a simple song , but it usually is . People had a lot of problems with this film , but I didn't see " Phantom " in the theater ; perhaps it played better on television . What I liked the best was the clarification at the end of something that happens in the beginning of the show , which I had always wondered about . This is a popular " Beauty and the Beast " type story which holds a lot of classic appeal . Added to Webber's best score , you really can't beat it . It's about the timelessness and power of love , and there's no argument with a message like that .
Wonderful movie about the power of one	James Stewart is a reporter who becomes involved in an old murder case in " Call Northside 777 , " directed by Henry Hathaway and costarring Lee J . Cobb and Richard Conte . The film is done semidocumentary style , in black and white , and is based on a true story . Much of the movie is done in a low-key , realistic way , with most of the energy coming from Stewart . It takes us through , at some length , certain procedures , such as the administration of a lie detector test . But the movie isn't about that . It's about a reporter's passion for the unjust imprisonment of a young man , who at the time he takes up the cause , has been in prison for 11 years . His wife divorced him at his own request , and his mother has been scrubbing floors to make money to offer a reward . The viewer becomes very engrossed in the story along with Stewart . Stewart gives an excellent performance which hearkens back to " Mr . Smith Goes to Washington " in a sense - the second half of the film calls for Mr . Smith's commitment , passion , and anger , and Stewart delivers . In the beginning , he's a cynical reporter who doesn't even want to do the story , and then as the facts emerge , he realizes there has been a gross injustice . What an actor . He's surrounded by strong performances from Helen Garde , Kazia Orzazewski , Cobb and Conte , who is very convincing as an innocent man . The most exciting part of the film is at the end , and here's where the spoiler comes in . To prove Conte's innocence , a very early version of a fax machine is used in the form of the AP wire , and it is suspenseful and fascinating to watch the increasingly enlarged photos come off the roll . The final moment , of course , as the last picture is developed , is thrilling . I had just one problem with the scene . The Stewart character is determined to enlarge the photo enough to see the date on a newspaper - when in fact , the headline would have been enough , as one could have gotten the date by researching the headline . It's a minor point . It's a great story and a wonderfully atmospheric movie , taking us into the seedy side of Chicago . Unfortunately , not has much has changed today in the justice system . If you have no money and no advocates , all too often what happened to Frank Wiecek is repeated over and over . But as Stewart tells Conte - I'm paraphrasing - " A state has admitted it made a mistake . That's no small thing . And it wouldn't happen anywhere else in the world . " True enough .
Sagan soaper	David Niven and Jean Seberg say " Bonjour Tristesse " in this 1958 film directed by Otto Preminger and also starring Deborah Kerr and Mylène Demongeot . Niven and Seberg are Raymond and Cecile , a father and daughter vacationing on the Riviera and having a superficial blast for themselves . Raymond has his current girlfriend Elsa ( Demongeot ) living with them as well . When a good friend of Raymond's late wife , Anne ( Kerr ) comes to visit , things change - at first for the better , as the four of them continue the party atmosphere . Later , when Anne becomes Raymond's fiancée and begins to discipline Cecile , the fun stops . Cecile decides that Anne will have to go . The film is told in flashback , black and white representing the present and glorious color used to tell the story , which is narrated by Seberg . There's lots about this movie that is fascinating , and some of it just sort of falls flat . The idea that a deep-thinking , responsible career woman comes into the lives of two bon vivants is an interesting one , and you couldn't ask for a better cast . The beginning of the film , and even Cecile's plan to get rid of Anne that she brings Elsa and her own boyfriend Phillipe in on has a lighthearted feel to it . What Raymond and Cecile never considered is that there are ramifications for actions , Cecile due to her immaturity and Raymond because he's Raymond . David Niven is terrific as the dashing Raymond , who loves a party , and Deborah Kerr gives a warm performance as Anne , who truly loves him and wants to ground both him and his daughter . The curiosity here is Seberg . She is as always the perfect gamine . Any time she's in a scene , you can't take your eyes off of her . She's so darn beautiful . Yet I don't think I've ever heard her say one line that I believed . And she's one actress where it just doesn't seem to matter . We hear a lot about " it " - well , she really had it . Gorgeous scenery - you want to leave for the Riviera immediately . And , truth to tell , spending some time with Raymond , Cecile and Elsa before the arrival of Anne wouldn't be bad either .
Don't be alone with the handyman	Ida Lupino is trapped in her own home by crazy Robert Ryan in " Beware , My Lovely , " a 1952 film from RKO . Lupino and Ryan did three films together and worked well as a team , both being consummate professionals and strong performers . In this film , based on a Broadway play called " The Man , " Lupino is a World War I widow who rents out a room in her home . She's very active and well-liked in her community and though her husband has been dead for two years , she's not ready to move on . The man who rents her room goes on vacation , and Lupino hires Robert Ryan to help her with some heavy-duty cleaning in the house . He's friendly enough to start , but later terrorizes her , locking her in the house , and not allowing her to answer the phone or the door , as he grows violent and more out of touch with reality . The character played by Ryan is shown in the beginning of the movie running away when he discovers a dead body in another house he's working in . It isn't clear whether or not he's the killer , since he seems surprised to see the body . He might be a split personality , as when his personality turns ugly toward Lupino , he seems to have no memory of his activities when he comes out of it . He doesn't know that he has the keys to Lupino's house in his pocket and doesn't know why he has tickets to a party that he bought from young children who came to the door . " Beware , My Lovely , " is a very suspenseful film , and the two leads give terrific performances . The tension builds to a very high level and ends in a way you're not expecting .
Widmark as Robin Hood	Richard Widmark wants " A Prize of Gold " in this 1955 film that also stars Mai Zetterling and Nigel Patrick . Widmark plays American soldier Joe Lawrence , who is stationed in Berlin post-World War II . Joe is usually in some sort of trouble , but he has a marital indiscretion that he can hold over his commanding officer's head so that he looks the other way . Joe falls in love with Maria , a teacher in an orphanage ( Zetterling ) . In order to get money to move the orphanage to Brazil , Maria has been cozying up to a wealthy benefactor . Jealous , Joe interferes and fights with the man , blowing the opportunity for Maria and the orphans sky-high . He promises Maria he will make it all right and therefore agrees to take part in a robbery of gold bullion that is to be transported . Things don't go as planned . This is an okay movie , memorable because when Lucille Ball hid in Widmark's house during an " I Love Lucy " episode , this is the film he was promoting . It's not terribly impressive except for the Berlin locations . The film is shot in somewhat muted color . Mai Zetterling is very good ; she was an actress with a wide range . Widmark does well in this roguish part , and Nigel Patrick turns in a strong performance as a sneaky accomplice . Pretty run of the mill .
A homeless man is a adopted by a rich family	Nick Nolte is " Down and Out in Beverly Hills , " a 1986 film directed and co-written by Paul Mazursky and starring Richard Dreyfuss , Bette Midler , Elizabeth Pena , Little Richard , and Tracy Nelson . Nolte is Jerry , a street person so low even his dog leaves him for a kind jogger . While searching for his dog , he stumbles onto the property of Dave and Barbara Whiteman - Whiteman is a clothes hanger king living the good life in Beverly Hill . Filling his pockets with rocks , Jerry attempts suicide by diving into the Whiteman pool , but is saved and ultimately taken in by Dave . Jerry isn't particularly grateful - he wants Courvoisier instead of the alcohol offered him , and , given dinner , questions the meat on the turkey . Dave , guilty about his wealth , bored with his life , and wanting to do some good , buys Jerry clothes and lets him live at the mansion . He even offers Jerry jobs , which Jerry doesn't accept . Jerry's history is on the vague side - he speaks of doing the concert piano circuit , he is recognized in a restaurant by as a writer , maybe he did some acting . . . hard to know . Before long , he's taken over the entire household , becoming the only one in the house that the Whiteman's psychologically disturbed dog , Matisse , can tolerate , Barbara Whiteman's masseuse and the man who finds her G-spot , the lover of housekeeper Carmen ( Pena ) after Dave goes back to sleeping with Barbara , the man who gets the Whiteman's anorexic daughter ( Nelson ) to fall in love with him and start eating ; and the man who convinces the androgynous Whiteman son to come out to his parents . Too late , Dave realizes he's Dr . Frankenstein , and Jerry is the monster . This is an entertaining film with dark undertones and good performances , particularly from Nolte , Dreyfuss , Midler , Pena and Mike ( Matisse the dog ) . Little Richard is a riot as a neighbor . Nolte is in great shape here , as is Midler , who looks fantastic . The party scene toward the end of the film where Dreyfuss chases Nolte throughout the house and grounds is quite funny . The ending isn't the best , but it's a fun watch anyway .
' 50s sorority life revealed	" Take Care of My Little Girl " is a tale of college and sorority life in the 1950s . Jeanne Crain is charming as the young woman who finds out that being in a sorority is not exactly as her mother described . Not that Crain has it all that rough - how bad can things be when you've got Jeffrey Hunter and Dale Robertson making eyes at you ? Despite the prettiness of the outward package of young stars , the film has a serious message about snobbery , shallowness , and hazing ( which still hits the news today ) . There are very good performances here from Crain , who is perfect for her role as a college freshman , Robertson , a student on the GI bill , Hunter , a big man on campus , and Jean Peters does a great job as the uberbitch . It's a film rich in college atmosphere .
Good documentary on one of our greats	Richard Schickel's 1991 documentary about Gary Cooper - " Gary Cooper : American Life , American Legend " gives us a look at the tremendous , all-American star through his films and his life . Narrated by Clint Eastwood , the theme is definitely " Gary Coooper , American " as we are taken through fast clips of his many appearances in westerns , and scenes from " Meet John Doe , " " Mr . Deeds Goes to Town , and " Sgt . York . " The best part of the documentary is the home movies of Cooper and his family as well as his childhood photos , showing him as a beautiful blonde kid with the sunny smile he would have his entire life . There is also a hilarious clip of Cooper on " The Jack Benny Show " doing the comeback on the number " Bird Dog " - and Benny loses it . The documentary also takes us briefly through his tumultuous affair with Patricia Neal , which nearly ruined both their lives . There's a certain cohesiveness missing from this bio / retrospective - it jumps around a lot and has no footage of Cooper being interviewed , which would have added a lot . Also , Clint Eastwood's narration was described as unobtrusive . What it was , was boring and monotone . Given that Cooper himself tended to be the strong , silent type on screen , we could have used a little animation . On a personal note , Gary Cooper was one of the handsomest men who ever lived - there were some looks at him in his early films , but not nearly enough for this fan . That smile , those lips , that bone structure - he was handsome throughout his life , but in films like " Morocco " and " Desire , " he is devastating . Instead of sitting through a scene from one of his worst performances , as Howard Roark in " The Fountainhead , " giving a speech that he admitted to the author he did not understand - a young , suave Cooper in a tux would have been a nice touch . This documentary , alas , was definitely produced by a man .
more than slightly delightful	Lana Turner is young and gorgeous in this light comedy about a waitress with a lucky penny and the dream of getting out of her humdrum life . The penny works wonders . After escaping her small town , a ladder falls on her in New York City - when she comes to , it's assumed she has amnesia ( she was deciding on her new name when the ladder came crashing down ) . After a trip to the library , she decides to become a long-lost heiress who disappeared as a child in 1925 . Robert Young plays her ex-boss who looks to expose her lie ; Walter Brennan is her welcoming , wealthy father ; Ward Bond is his security guy ; Dame May Witty the heiress ' former nanny . Ray Collins of " Perry Mason " fame also makes an appearance , as does Eugene Palette as the newspaper editor who prints the amnesiac's story . It's a terrific cast , with Young's role being a departure for him . He does it well . Lana is simply adorable . The movie leaves an open question , which is kind of fun , too . All in all , very enjoyable .
bad day at the zoo for Mel and Goldie	The star power of Mel Gibson and Goldie Hawn help this 1990 action film , which is about a witness protection program refugee who reconnects by accident with his old girlfriend . The two then run to avoid the people after him . And run and run and run . There are so many chase scenes in this movie , I lost count , but they lead to a very effective finale in the zoo . I enjoyed this movie because of its two stars . I thought they had great chemistry and repartee . The movie is short on plot and character development , you know , things that one would occasionally enjoy seeing in a film , and long on action , charm , Mel's rear , Goldie's figure , and fashion . On this basis , I found it enjoyable .
Tony Martin & Rita Hayworth make beautiful music together	Tony Martin has " Music in My Heart , " a 1940 B movie also starring Rita Hayworth , Edith Fellows , Alan Mowbray , Eric Blore and George Tobias . Martin is singer Bob Gregory , who is about to be deported . We never get the full story , except his parents never applied for citizenship . Presumably he was born elsewhere but raised in the U . S . On his way to the boat to leave the country , his cab collides with the one carrying gorgeous Patricia O'Malley ( Hayworth ) who is on her way to the boat , too , so she can marry a rich man ( Mowbray ) . They both miss the boat , and Bob ends up not only staying with Patricia's family but falling in love with her as well . The film is filled with music and some great singing by Martin , who by the time I was a child , wasn't doing this type of singing any longer . He had a fantastic tenor voice . Rita's hair looks black here but she's no less fantastic looking . She only has one dance , but it's basically hip movement - we don't get to see much else . She and Martin make a handsome team and give relaxed performances . " Music in My Heart " is probably a cut above a B , considering the cast . Since Cohn was grooming Rita for stardom , he surrounded her with good talent . Not that she needed anyone else around her - she always glittered like gold .
don't mess with sorority rejects	This is an oldie but a goodie , albeit a short one - one of the other comments explains what happened , but no one knows the reason . Myrna Loy is very beautiful and exotic as Ursula Georgi ( which I actually think is an Italian name ) who is a half-caste seeking revenge on sorority sisters who kept her out of their group . She uses the power of suggestion , switching their actual horoscopes by mail that they receive from a swami with predictions of doom . One by one , the women die . She ultimately knocks off the swami and turns her sights on the disbeliever of the group , played by Irene Dunne . Loy would soon break free from exotica with " The Thin Man " series . Mrs . Laurence Olivier at the time , Jill Esmond , appears in the film , as do Ricardo Cortez and Peg Entwhistle . For Entwhistle , the dire predictions in the film played out in real life for her . Shortly after this movie was made , she achieved a lasting fame by committing suicide by jumping from the " Hollywoodland " sign in Los Angeles .
Pleasant comedy of Cary Grant as an army wife	I saw this movie years and years ago and always remembered the line , " Be quiet or people will think we smuggled in a cow . " I was excited to see it on TCM . Alas , while it's good , it's not as hysterically funny as I thought it was going to be . Cary Grant plays a Frenchman with an English accent who winds up married to an American officer , played by Ann Sheridan . I loved their banter , especially in the beginning . Their wedding night is interrupted when she gets orders to ship out , and the problem becomes how to get her new husband home with her to America when all the spousal regulations seem to be for brides . For me , the funniest scene took place while Grant is waiting for the bus with all the brides . Over a loudspeaker , a female officer informs the women about the new styles in the states and the way hair is worn . Grant's face is priceless while she's talking . The movie is cute and notable for Grant dressing like a woman and looking very homely . Ann Sheridan is very good . The film is a little slow , but if you love Cary Grant , you should enjoy it .
Typical Fox musical	Betty Grable goes " Down Argentine Way " in this 1940 musical , also starring Don Ameche , Charlotte Greenwood , Carmen Miranda , and J . Carroll Naish . Grable is Glenda Crawford , who buys a horse from the South American Ricardo Quintana ( Ameche ) , unaware that the families don't get along . On hearing her last name , Quintana realizes that he has to cancel the sale in accordance with his father's ( Naish ) orders . Glenda and Ricardo are already falling in love , so although Glenda rejects him after the aborted sale , she soon heads for Argentina on the excuse of buying horses . With her is her aunt Binnie ( Greenwood ) . There , she reconnects with Ricardo , though she has to meet his father under the assumed name of Cunningham . This is a typical Fox musical with its bright , vibrant colors and high energy . And , like many Fox musicals , it has no plot and literally one musical number after another . Because Fox had Carmen Miranda and Cesar Romero under contract , there was often a south of the border flavor . Here , Miranda plays herself performing in a nightclub , and she's a dynamo . Ameche sings pleasantly and does his usual good job , and Grable as usual is a joy - a pretty , likable actress , a good dancer and singer , and a bundle of energy . Charlotte Greenwood has several musical numbers and is very entertaining . These musicals are always good for what ails you . My favorite Fox musicals of this kind are " Springtime in the Rockies " and " The Gang's All Here , " but " Down Argentine Way " is a delightful film .
Very funny Mel Brooks spoof / homage to Hitchcock	Mel Brooks is a very funny man , and though sometimes I think his comedy is a little on the low side , " High Anxiety " has some truly hilarious moments . Mel riffs on Hitchcock , right down to Madeline Kahn's gray suit a la Kim Novak in Vertigo . He combines scenes from " Spellbound , " " Vertigo , " " Foreign Correspondent , " " The Birds , " " Psycho , " " Dial M for Murder , " and " North by Northwest " in this story of a man taking over as the head of a mental sanitarium , replacing a man who is murd - uh , dead . Kahn is the Hitchcock blonde whose father is in the asylum . To give you an idea of this place where the lunatics have definitely taken over - Cloris Leachman plays a nurse who's into S & M with Harvey Korman . Both of them are a riot . Mel plays it straight which makes him even funnier . I have two favorite scenes - the first is Mel , doing a perfect imitation of Sinatra's style , singing " High Anxiety " to Kahn . He's fabulous , and the look on Kahn's face is delicious . My other favorite scene is when Brooks and Kahn disguise themselves as elderly people to get through airport security . Psychiatric expert Brooks thinks the more noise you make , the less people notice you . The two of them do a fabulous skit which is priceless . We really lost a treasure when we lost Madeline Kahn , one of the all-time great talents . It's wonderful to see this and remember her . I do believe that because of the humor , the film can be enjoyed without having seen the Hitchcock films spoofed , but of course , it's all the better if you have . A delightful film .
Tom Hanks and the Holy Grail	Right off , I admit to not having read the book " The Da Vinci Code " but I was familiar with the story before seeing the film . Due to the lackluster reviews this movie received , I decided to rent it rather than rush out and see it . I find sometimes that films not well received in the theater do better as rentals . I'm not sure why . It may be the shelling out of so much money to see a film nowadays . Nevertheless , I suspect I had a better experience than some people . I won't bother to repeat the story , but I am one person who did not find this film dull , lackluster , or felt like nothing was happening . I found it suspenseful and interesting , with good performances , Ian McKellan being a standout . The scenery was stunning , as was the musical score - the whole look and sound was that of a very big money production , which of course it was . I liked both Tom Hanks and Audrey Tatou - Hanks never imposes himself on the material , so he didn't try to make more of the Robert Langdon character than is there - which isn't much . Just about anyone could have played the part . Hanks was the icing on an expensive cake . Audrey Tatou was very good in her role . But these parts take a back seat to the intricate and controversial story . " The Da Vinci Code " is provocative , exciting , and well done . My only complaint is that it had several of what I call false endings - i . e . , you think the film is over and it isn't . I loved the true ending - once it got there .
Nice film with a young Rock and James Dean	Charles Coburn gives the family of the woman who rejected him $100 , 000 in " Has Anybody Seen My Gal , " a delightful 1952 comedy set in the 1920s . It's directed by Douglas Sirk and also stars Piper Laurie , Gigi Perreau , Lynn Bari , William Reynolds and Skip Homeier . It seems that when Samuel Fulton was a young man , the young woman who turned him down spurned him on to great things . Now , with no heirs , he wants to leave her family his money . Despite his belief that he's dying , he heads to their hometown and moves in on them as a " Mr . Smith " in order to observe them when they are presented with a check for $100 , 000 . Rock Hudson has a supporting role in this film - he plays a soda jerk and the love interest of Piper Laurie . Dancing the Charleston , he is darn cute . And if you think the kid at the soda fountain giving old man Fulton a hard time is James Dean , you're right , it is . People often say that James Dean only made three films . Wrong . He only STARRED in three films . Gigi Perreau is adorable without being cloying . Piper Laurie , in a Debbie Reynolds type of role , does a good job , though later on , she would shine more in drama . But at this point , she and Rock were just paying their dues along with William Reynolds , who became a TV actor . This is Coburn's film all the way - he's a riot as an old codger who gets a dose of health and love from the family and gives some back in return . " Has Anybody Seen My Gal " demonstrates the fine directing gifts of Douglas Sirk whose name would become synonymous with big budget soap operas . But in 1952 , it was fun all the way with Coburn and Universal's stable of young players .
A bad dream leads to a nightmare for a family .	John Garfield's last film was " He Ran All the Way , " about a payroll robber who hides out at a young woman's apartment , frightening and intimidating her family . Shelley Winters , Gladys George , Norman Lloyd , and Wallace Ford also star . This looks to be a small film , written by blacklisted Dalton Trumbo under another name , but I found it very tense and very good with a wonderful performance by Garfield . He's an unwilling robber due to a scary dream the night before , but his friend , Norman Lloyd , forces him to go through with it on the day planned . When Garfield shoots a policeman , he runs to an indoor public swimming pool to get rid of the briefcase and hide . There he meets Shelley Winters . He sticks with her , ends up in the apartment she shares with her parents and her brother and decides to stay . Ruggedly handsome Garfield portrays a man capable of brutality due to his fear but who is basically good . Unfortunately the family doesn't understand how unloved he feels , and his friendly signals are rejected , causing him to act out . Winters handles a difficult role beautifully - a young woman without much life experience , attracted to this man and terrified for her family . Is her goal to get him away from them , or does she really care for him ? Wallace Ford , as the frustrated father who is unable to protect his family , is excellent . Like another poster , I would have wished for a bigger film as Garfield's last , but in the end , he handed in another excellent performance and elevated the movie . What was ahead for him ? Well , he was blacklisted - perhaps his friend Clifford Odets ' affirmation that Garfield had never been a member of the Communist party would have helped him , but we'll never know . Garfield died the day after Odets ' testimony .
Whodo ? You do !	Myrna Loy is a judge who sentences Cary Grant to Shirley Temple in " The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer , " also starring Rudy Vallee , Johnny Sands , Ray Collins , and Veda Ann Borg . Grant is Richard Nugent , an artist who gets into some trouble and comes before Judge Turner ( Loy ) . He leaves court and heads for a high school to give a lecture , only to encounter Judge Turner's 17 going on 35-year-old sister , Susan , played by Shirley Temple . Like the rest of the girls in the audience , Susan thinks Richard is dreamy but takes things a step further . She corners him in a room for a school paper interview and asks important artistic questions such as , " Are you married ? " and " Have you ever been in love ? " To get rid of her , Richard agrees to paint her portrait as America . When he returns home that evening , Susan is waiting in his apartment . Moments later , Richard is in jail , the Judge having figured out where her niece has gone . The court psychiatrist ( Collins ) talks the Judge into letting Susan get Nugent out of her system . It doesn't sit well with Richard , or Susan's quasi-boyfriend ( Sands ) . Grant's comic timing and mastery at underplaying is evident here as he reluctantly dates Susan , even dressing down and switching cars with her boyfriend to disillusion her . The scene at the picnic , when he tries his hands ( and legs ) at several events is hilarious . Toward the end of the film , he takes Judge Turner to dinner ; before long , the entire cast is at the table talking and arguing as the waiters continually sing " Happy Birthday " to one customer after another , and a diner at another table tries to retrieve Rudy Vallee's chair for his own party - it's a great scene . Loy is sophisticated and glamorous which belies her judge-like decorum in the courtroom , where she's all sternness and intelligence . Temple is very funny as she tries to appear older and calls Grant " Dickie . " Her pseudosophisticated talk and haughtiness are amusing , but Temple is at her best when she's being what she is - a teenager . Johnny Sands is positively adorable as her boyfriend Jerry . His bio says he got fan mail until the day he died - I can believe it . This is such a delightful movie , with a wonderful script by Sidney Sheldon and marvelous performances . The next time you're feeling blue , remember : " You remind me of a man ! " " What man ? " " The man with the power ! " " What power ? " " The power of whodo ! " " Whodo ? " " You do ! " " What ? " " You remind me of a man ! "
The more things change , the more they remain the same	Glenn Ford enters the " Blackboard Jungle " in this 1955 film about high school youths . It also stars Vic Morrow , Sidney Poitier , Louis Calhern , Margaret Hayes , Richard Kiley , Anne Francis , Paul Mazursky and Jamie Farr . Ford is a young teacher who starts work at an urban school , only to learn that there is no discipline , precious little learning and that violence and racism are rampant . Though his colleagues are cynical , shell-shocked and / or burned out , Ford , who plays Richard Dadier , is determined to make the situation work . He has a pregnant wife at home and is committed to teaching . He tries different ways to get through to the students , including enlisting the help of one of the leaders ( Poitier ) , who initially rejects him . He and two other teachers ( Hayes and Kiley ) become victims of violence , and Dadier's wife begins receiving anonymous letters and phone calls suggesting that her husband is involved with an attractive teacher ( Hayes ) . The acting teacher Stella Adler claimed in one of her lectures that juvenile delinquency is a direct result of World War II , and there is a reference to that here - fatherless homes , working mothers and a general sense of world unrest . I had a teacher who used to say that with every war , people's manners became worse . One of the comments mentions that this film was not shocking when it was released ; I can believe it . Since I can remember , there have been schools where kids were unruly and violence occurred . Back in the ' 50s , over 50 % of students did not graduate from high school . What happened to them ? They entered the workforce . Today when a kid doesn't graduate from high school , it's a disaster because there's no workforce for them to enter . The film sports great direction by Richard Brooks , a wonderful soundtrack and superb acting , with Ford giving a fine performance as the determined Dadier . Richard Kiley does an excellent job as an idealistic teacher . Poitier plays a talented student , Gregory Miller , and he's very forceful , as is Vic Morrow as Artie West , an angry tough guy . The other students , such as Rafael Campos , Dan Terranova and Jamie Farr are very believable . " The Blackboard Jungle " doesn't offer much in the way of solutions , except that commitment and discipline do have an effect if you stick with it . I know several teachers who have walked into bad situations and done beautifully ; something happens when kids finally realize that you care . Unfortunately , there are all too few Richard Dadiers around and way too many Artie Wests .
Excellent and absorbing	" Inside Man " is a wonderful Spike Lee film starring Denzel Washington , Clive Owen , Willem Dafoe , Jodie Foster and Christopher Plummer . It's about a bank robbery planned by Owen that turns out to be something very clever and very different . Washington plays a police detective under investigation for missing money who , knowing he's innocent , wants to prove himself and get to detective first grade . He and his partner investigate this bank robbery , which has 50 hostages , all who have been given outfits and masks so that they're dressed like the robbers . Therefore , it's impossible to tell who the robbers are . It's also increasingly difficult , as Washington attempts to negotiate with them , to tell what it is they're after . When Foster , a high-level negotiator hired by the bank owner ( Plummer ) enters the scene , Washington knows something much bigger than money is involved . Really excellent movie with twists and turns combined with humor and some really scary scenes . My only complaint is that Clive Owen is a bad choice to play someone who spends most of the movie in a mask . It's too frustrating to have someone that good-looking covered up .
Two sisters and their saga get the MGM treatment	Lana Turner as Marianne marries her sister Marguerite's beau in " Green Dolphin Street , " an MGM extravaganza ( but in black and white ) that probably was meant to equal Gone With the Wind . The story concerns a family , the Patourels , living on the Channel Islands . Their mother ( Gladys Cooper ) was forbidden to marry the love of her life ( Frank Morgan ) and instead married Octavius ( Edmund Gwenn ) and has two daughters . Morgan returns to the area with a son , William ( Richard Hart ) and both of the girls go after him , though he falls in love with Marguerite ( Donna Reed ) . Eventually he ends up in New Zealand and , in a drunken stupor , writes to Octavius for his daughter's hand in marriage - except he writes the name Marianne , not Marguerite , thereby changing his life and the lives of the sisters forever . The film is a bit long but holds the viewer once it gets going . Its main problem when it's seen today is the painted backdrops and fake scenery , all extremely obvious . When one compares the backdrops and scenery of the earlier Gone with the Wind to this , it's obvious that Selznick demanded a lot more care from his artists than did the powers that be on this film . There are several striking scenes , but the best is Donna Reed climbing a tunnel inside of a cave to escape the rising tide . The earthquake scenes and the Maori attacks are also excellent and exciting . The role of Marianne is huge and well essayed by Lana Turner . Marianne is a smart , controlling woman whose guidance turns William into a success . Apparently the character in the book was somewhat plain ; obviously , Turner isn't , so she brings a femininity and beauty to the part as well as a strong core . Of course , when she's supposed to be pregnant , she's wearing a dress tightly cinched at the waist . It was considered indecent to show pregnancy back then , but it's ridiculous . As Marguerite , Donna Reed manages to bring some color into what is a somewhat thankless role . Van Heflin , as a friend and eventual partner of William , gives a wonderful performance as a tough but kind and tender man who makes William do the right thing by Marianne . Gladys Cooper does her usual fine job as Mrs . Patourel , and her final scene is beautiful . There were several very touching parts of the movie , and that was one of them . Newcomer Richard Hart , who died four years later , is William and looks good once he grows his mustache . The role , however , could have used a more exciting performance . Hart was from the theater and actually performed many of the classics on television in its early days . On an interesting side note , Linda Christian plays Turner's Maori maid . Turner at that time was seeing Tyrone Power . The story goes that Christian overheard Turner say that Power was going to be in Rome . Christian wangled the money for her and her sister , went to Rome , and stayed in the same hotel as Power . He never returned to Turner and the next year married Christian . Apropos of this , " Green Dolphin Street " asks age-old questions - are there mistakes in life , or a guiding hand ? Did William really write the name of the wrong sister , or was that as it was meant to be ? We all have to decide for ourselves . I'm not sure " Green Dolphin Street " will help one do that , but it's entertaining nonetheless .
Another great 20th Century Fox noir	Dana Andrews stands " Where the Sidewalk Ends " in this 1950 film that also stars Gene Tierney , Gary Merrill , Karl Malden and Neville Brand . Andrews plays New York City Detective Sgt . Mark Dixon , a cop with a bad temper who has gotten into trouble in the past for beating suspects . When a man is murdered at a gambling club owned by a mobster , Scalise ( Merrill ) , Dixon and his partner go to investigate . Scalise blames the murder on Ken Paine ( Stevens ) , who has now left the club after fighting not only with his wife , Morgan ( Tierney ) but the victim . Dixon thinks the victim won a lot of money and was killed as a result by the mobster's men . He goes to see Paine and , not realizing he has a plate in his head from the war , knocks him to the floor and inadvertently kills him . Now he must cover up the murder . As a further complication , he falls for Morgan ; her father ( Ken Tully ) , who went to Paine's apartment after he saw that Paine had hit his daughter , is arrested for the crime . This is a really terrific , gritty noir with some good performances . The ruggedly handsome and weathered Andrews is convincing as a tough yet nervous detective who has to stay one step ahead of his colleagues . The movie reunites him with his fabulous " Laura " costar , Gene Tierney , and she looks lovely as a model with bad taste in men who apparently is used to being roughed up . Little does she know , she's got another one on her hands . Ken Tully does a terrific job as her father , who protests his innocence despite some damning evidence . Karl Malden is very tough as Dixon's boss . My only problem with this well-directed , fast-moving and absorbing film is the ending . Pure Hollywood and , putting myself in Tierney's place , I doubt I would react the same way . A minor criticism for a film written by Ben Hecht and directed by Otto Preminger . I didn't find it as awe-inspiring as " Laura , " but few things in this world are . If you like film noir , this is a must-see .
excellent independent film	Robert Desiderio wrote a wonderful role for his wife , Judith Light , in " Save Me , " a 2007 film about a religious group , Genesis . At Genesis , the idea is to make gay men straight . One of the heads of Genesis , played by Light , blames her son's suicide on the fact that he was gay , unable to face up to the fact that it was her rejection of him that helped him along . Her second husband ( Steven Lang ) , not the boy's father , is a little more lenient in his views , and this causes conflict . When it's obvious that two of the men at Genesis ( Jeremy Glazer and Chad Allen ) are attracted to one another , she becomes increasingly more disturbed . This is a very good film about , as far as I'm concerned , a misguided attempt by fundamentalists to " straighten out " gay men on the premise that it's in the Bible . There's so much in the Bible that contradicts itself , but there's one thing pretty obvious in the New Testament - judgment is to be left to a higher power . A religious group that condemns someone not of their belief system isn't , in my opinion , Christian or religious . So much for that . The film beautifully demonstrates its own point of view - love and meaningful relationships are what matter , whether between the same or the opposite sex . Jeremy Glazer and Chad Allen give fine performances as two men who have found their way to clean lifestyles but still need to be who they are and seek love with another human being . The star , of course , is Light , who , deglamorized and with darker hair , bears NO resemblance to the elegant Mrs . Mead on " Ugly Betty . " What a performance - and she's been giving great performances for 30 years . One hates her prejudice but realizes that it's born out of her own denial at the same time . Her husband's attempts to understand her , his loyalty to her , and his desire to help her , are very touching . But he doesn't feel as she does . In " Save Me , " we're shown that a place like Genesis has its good points - there's nothing wrong with getting off of drugs and booze and contributing to the community - but it needs to stop there . You can be gay without drugs , booze , and indiscriminate sex . You can also , as so well shown in the film , be gay and religious at the same time . No matter what anyone says , God doesn't discriminate .
Those calla lilies are in bloom again !	Katharine Hepburn takes up residence in a theatrical rooming house in " Stage Door , " one of the great examples of ensemble acting in film . Besides Hepburn , the film features Adolph Menjou , Lucille Ball , Ann Miller , Ginger Rogers , Andrea Leeds , Eve Arden , Constance Collier , and Gail Patrick . Hepburn is a the daughter of a wealthy man who comes to New York to try her hand at acting . She talks a good game , but as we soon learn , she has no emotional understanding or connection to acting at all , approaching everything intellectually . All of the women are pursuing careers in theater , some with more success than others , and Patrick has a sugar daddy ( Menjou ) . Leeds is the tragic character , a star from the previous season who can't find work but is desperate for the lead in " Enchanted April . " The atmosphere created by director Gregory Lacava perfectly evokes the lively atmosphere of young women living together , sitting in the parlor complaining about food , men , and work or lack of it , as they sing , joke , play piano , strum the ukulele , and talk on the phone - all at once . The acting is uniformly excellent , with each actress creating a unique character . Lucille Ball gives evidence of the comic timing that would make her one of the greatest TV stars of all time , and there are plenty of ironic one-liners to be had from Eve Arden , and Ginger Rogers matches her in sarcasm . Ann Miller was supposedly 14 when she made this film ; it doesn't seem possible but that was her story and she stuck to it . We do get to see a little bit of her tapping . Andrea Leeds , bearing such a strong resemblance to Olivia DeHavilland , gives a touching performance as the doomed Kay , who does not have the emotional stability to withstand what can be a devastating career . It's an extremely melodramatic role and rather than have her play against this , LaCava had her play to it , thus dating what could have stood as a compelling performance even today . The climactic scenes toward the end are pure ' 30s , stripping the film of previous lightness and going into tragedy but are effective and real tear-jerkers . By the film's end , though , we've come full circle . The film is based on the play of the same name which is actually quite different . The whole idea was probably based on the Studio Club in New York City . " Stage Door " is wonderful and the script , acting and direction make it a deeply satisfying experience .
Landmark British film	One of the saddest things in the world is to see people who are not allowed to live as they are because of the confines of law . This is the case in " Victim , " 1961 , a powerful film starring Dirk Bogarde and Sylvia Syms . Bogarde plays Melville Farr , a prominent barrister on an upward career path who becomes involved in tracking down a blackmail ring which is targeting homosexuals . In England , until 1967 , it was against the law to be homosexual , making these men a target for blackmailers . Being a closeted gay himself , Farr learns that a young man he once knew was being blackmailed about supposed a relationship with Farr ; the boy ultimately kills himself after unsuccessfully trying to reach Farr again and again . With another lover's suicide in his past , Farr becomes determined , even if it costs him his marriage and career , to bring the blackmailers to justice . Though the storyline may seem dated , " Victim " holds up very well today , showing the pain and unhappiness of living a life in secret , the different views held on homosexuality nearly 50 years ago , and how far the gay movement has come . From the film , it seems that homosexuality was regarded as shameful , aberrant , and disgusting - though that view is held in some circles today , people can at least be out in the open if they choose . Melville Farr entered into marriage being completely honest with his spouse ( Syms ) , whom he loves , and promising her that his gay affairs had stopped . He kept his promise to her . When asked if she found her marriage fulfilling , she answers , " I suppose so . It's all I know . " There's a deep love there ; he doesn't want to lose her . If he's sexually ambivalent , emotionally he isn't . It was a bold move for Bogarde to take on this role , as the film was controversial at the time and some of his large fan base deserted him . As in the film , he quickly learned who would stick by him . The subject matter perhaps appealed to him because of his personal life , but probably also because the part of Melville is a terrific role . Bogarde gives a fantastic performance of a man suffering deep pain who is forced to hurt someone he loves . Syms is excellent as his wife , and the two have their most powerful scene when Farr tells her what went on with the young man and pulls no punches . There are a few twists in the plot , some interesting supporting characters , and no pat , simple ending . Many believe this film sparked a public debate about homosexuality . Six years after this film , the law making homosexuality a crime in Britain was repealed . This is an excellent film , sure to start a discussion even now , in a more enlightened time .
Billy visits post-war Berlin	Billy Wilder returned to Berlin after the war to film part of " A Foreign Affair , " starring Marlene Dietrich , Jean Arthur , and John Lund . Wilder lived and worked in Berlin and , following his always excellent instincts , got out and came to America just in time . In the film , a group of government people arrive in Berlin to assess the morale of the 12 , 000 American soldiers still stationed there . One of them is a congresswoman from Iowa , the very uptight and put together Miss Frost , aptly named and beautifully portrayed by Jean Arthur . When the group is taken on a tour of the city , the Berlin Wilder shows us is hideous , filled with rubble and the shells and half-shells of buildings . Frost , frantically taking notes , soon realizes with Iowan sensibility that the garbage isn't just on the surface as she sees soldiers fraternizing with Frauleins , and one woman rolling a baby buggy with an American flag attached . When two American soldiers mistake her for a Fraulein , Arthur plays along and winds up in an underground club , the Lorelei , where the star is Marlene Dietrich . Dietrich is a gorgeous woman who survived by picking up with a high-ranking Nazi official , and she's kept out of a labor camp now thanks to the protection of an army officer named Pringle , played by John Lund . When Lund romances Frost to keep her from investigating the matter , problems arise . Arthur and Dietrich are fantastic in their roles and play off each other magnificently . The casting is perfect : Two blonds , complete opposites , one worldly wise and one with a hand over her open mouth in shock , one oozing sex and the other oozing primness . Dietrich performs several numbers in her inimitable style , which is an added treat . This is Billy Wilder at his cynical best , with Pringle selling his birthday cake on the black market that Frost brings him from a constituent , and being slipped stockings for his girlfriend . He also shows how the Germans in charge bow down to Dietrich , knowing who she is . There are funny scenes , sexually overt scenes ( including a suggestion of S & M in the Dietrich-Lund relationship ) , and touching scenes in " A Foreign Affair . " Throughout , you will never be bored . This film also has the distinction of an ad-lib by John Lund that Wilder kept in the film : " Relax , baby , it's mother's day . " Relax , enjoy , and ponder - it's Billy Wilder .
Wonderful	Clifton Webb is " Dreamboat , " in this 1954 film . Webb plays a silent film star named Bruce Blair who is now a college professor under what one assumes is his real name , Thornton Sayre . All is well until his silent films begin to appear hosted by his former co-star ( Ginger Rogers ) on that new popular medium , television . The college board calls for his resignation , so Sayre goes to New York with his brainy daughter ( Anne Francis ) to get an injunction to stop the televising of his old films . Webb was an underrated actor who could do the acerbic queen beautifully , but one forgets he was also a gifted comedian and a moving dramatic actor - " The Man Who Never Was " and " Titanic " being two prime examples of his capabilities . He also was a trained opera singer , something the New York theater audiences , alas , only got to hear . In " Dreamboat , " his silent film character is a cross between John Gilbert , Rudolph Valentino and Douglas Fairbanks , Jr . , and Webb does a terrific job overplaying the silent film acting . Ginger Rogers is wonderful as the glamorous , conniving ex-costar , Gloria Marlowe , but I have to agree with one comment , that the two stars had little chemistry . The role was originally offered to Marlene Dietrich - she and Webb might have been quite funny together . Anne Francis is the plain Jane daughter in an early role , and Jeffrey Hunter is the gorgeous Bill Ainslee in an early role for him , a man assigned by his agency boss ( Sam Levitt ) to escort Francis around town . They make a great couple ; both appeared in the 1965 programmer ' Brainstorm ' to excellent effect . By that time , their studio days were over ; Hunter's film career had disintegrated , and Francis would do her most of her career in television . They both still looked fabulous , though . Very , very entertaining . Highly recommended .
Pyewacket and friends get the Hollywood treatment	The play Bell , Book , and Candle was a favorite of mature actresses to do in summer stock and take on the road . One famous story , told by director Harold J . Kennedy , has Ginger Rogers insisting that her then husband , William Marshall , who was not an actor , costar with her . Marshall wore a toupee , and when he walked through a doorway , his toupee caught on a nail and stayed behind , dangling in the doorway as he walked on stage . The play was adapted successfully into a beautiful color film starring Kim Novak , James Stewart , Jack Lemmon , Elsa Lanchester , Hermoine Gingold , Ernie Kovacs , and Janice Rule . It's light entertainment , about a normal-appearing family of witches ( Novak , Lemmon , and Lanchester ) and the publisher ( Stewart ) who lives in their building . The most expert of them is the sultry , soft-voiced Gillian , who would love to be normal . One night , with Stewart in her apartment , she puts a spell on him using her Siamese cat , Pyewacket , and he falls in love with her . " Bell Book and Candle " was filmed on a charming set that replicates New York . The movie is loads of fun . Jack Lemmon is very funny in a supporting role as Gillian's brother , a musician in the witch and warlock-laden Zodiac Club . He uses his powers to turn streetlights on and off and to turn on the occasional woman . Janice Rule is perfect as the snobby ex-college rival of Gillian , now dating Stewart , and Ernie Kovacs has a great turn as an eccentric who is writing the definitive book on witches . Lanchester and Gingold , of course , are always wonderful , Lanchester Gillian's daft aunt and Gingold as a sort of queen of witchcraft . Kim Novak is a good fit for Gillian , giving the character a detachment befitting a witch , showing emotion when it becomes appropriate , and with that voice , fabulous face , and magnificent wardrobe , she certainly is magical . Stewart , in his last foray as a romantic lead , costars with Novak as he did in Vertigo , and they make an effective team . He supplies the warmth , she supplies the coolness , and somehow , together they spark . In this , of course , he's much more elegant than in " Vertigo . " A charming film , good for a Sunday afternoon , good around Christmas ( as part of it takes place at Christmastime ) , and great if you feel like smiling .
a wayward preacher meets up with Columbo	This Columbo episode is a real treat , as it features a singing Johnny Cash and footage from one of his actual concerts . Cash plays a singing evangelist who , with his domineering wife , travels the country performing religious music in order to raise money for a new tabernacle . Johnny's a little upset as he never gets to see any of the money . When he makes noise about it , his wife , well played by Ida Lupino , to keep him in line , prances out an underage member of the choir whom Cash once seduced . The Cash character plots a great murder by crashing his plane with his wife and choir member in it while he parachutes out . I thought Johnny Cash did a great job . He had such a tremendous voice and presence , and acting was very natural and relaxed . All in all , a wonderful " Columbo . "
beautiful movie star , miserable life	It's sometimes unbelievable how on the outside , someone can look like they have it all - but not . No matter how many times that seems to be the case , one never seems to be able to get used to it . Gene Tierney was one such person - a beautiful woman from a wealthy family who became a top movie star , had an affair with a future President , married a man who became a top designer , and had two children . It all sounds great , except the marriage was a volatile one , one daughter was born severely retarded and sensory deprived , which Tierney blamed on her own fame . Riddled with guilt , she ultimately had a severe breakdown . You would never have known it to see this goddess in " Laura , " for which she is perhaps best remembered , and " Leave Her to Heaven , " in which in my opinion she was at her most beautiful , and as the manipulative , hard Isabel in " The Razor's Edge . " Gene Tierney was a dream movie star . But when a WAC quarantined with German measles escaped from her barracks to meet her favorite actress , the result was Tierney's damaged daughter , Daria , and that one action by a fan changed Tierney's life forever . There's even a movie based on it - " The Mirror Cracked . " Tierney never forgave herself . At one point , her second daughter came home from school to find the apartment building surrounded by people as her mother stood on a ledge . As mentioned above , Tierney was able to have another child and find true love in her next marriage . Although wonderful and beautiful in her small part in " Advise and Consent " in the ' 60s , she found herself too nervous in front of the camera and did less and less until her death from emphysema - the smoking was to lower her high-pitched voice , something the studios recommended . The stories on " Biography " are usually very interesting and fascinating . They're also often very sad . Angela Lansbury once said when performers are working , they truly do wear a mask . Tierney's was a most beautiful one , hiding a good deal of sorrow .
An energetic interview with a great Hollywood director	This documentary on William Wellman , from " The Men Who Made the Movies " series done by Richard Shickel , benefits greatly from the fact that there is so much interview footage of Wellman . This is true of the fantastic Raoul Walsh documentary as well . Wellman here is full of vinegar , a rugged , handsome individual , though early photos show that he was more than just handsome . He has lots of stories and speaks bluntly of the producers with whom he worked - Zanuck and Selznick in particular . Though the narrative by Robert Wagner speaks of Wellman's remarkable star-making and star-spotting abilities , Wellman himself doesn't make a big deal of it , other than to say the director knows what the actor is doing better than the actor does . He was responsible for helping a few actors win Oscars - Frederic March , Janet Gaynor , Brian Donlevy , Robert Mitchum , James Whitmore , Jan Sterling and Claire Trevor . And he discovered James Cagney and Gary Cooper , as well as Clint Eastwood if for only wanting to cast him in a role instead of Tab Hunter . Wellman shows what makes a great director or a great anything - passion , which he had not for only directing but flying . He was glad to be a studio director because it gave him a chance to do a whole variety of films . He was proudest of The Story of G . I . Joe and had the most fun making a Tarzan movie - so much fun , in fact , that he begged to make another one . As captivating as many of his films , this look at William Wellman is a wonderful entry in Richard Shickel's remarkable " The Men Who Made the Movies " series .
James Mason as valet turned espionage agent	James Mason does an excellent job as a suave valet to the British Ambassador in " Five Fingers . " Desiring the life of a Rio de Janeiro gentleman , he starts selling secrets out of the Ambassador's safe to the Nazis , with the help of the wife of his former employer , Danielle Darrieux . Michael Rennie is brought in to see if he can discover the source of the leak . Joseph Mankiewicz directed the film , and it's done in partial documentary style with narration . It's based on a true story , though the Darrieux character was invented for the film . This is a highly entertaining film with some wonderful , suspenseful moments , a neat twist at the end , and the highly atmospheric Turkish scenery . Highly recommended .
Don't mess with Bette - ever !	Still fresh from their success and newfound love in " All About Eve , " Bette Davis and Gary Merrill made this independent film , " Another Man's Poison , " based on a play by Leslie Sands . Davis is Janet Frobisher , a successful mystery writer living in a mausoleum of a house out on the moors . When her husband's partner in a bank robbery comes there looking for him , Frobisher announces that he's in the study - dead from the poison she gave him ( medicine intended for her beloved horse , Fury ) . While they're attempting to dispose of the body , Frobisher's paramour , whom she summoned earlier , arrives with his fiancé ( who is also Frobisher's secretary ) . The bank robber , named George Bates , introduces himself as Frobisher's estranged husband and settles in . This is a neat , atmospheric story with an edgy , vital performance by Davis . Merrill , ruggedly handsome , is appropriately gruff and sinister . Though his character thinks he and Frobisher might really have a chance at playing house , his competition is the very handsome , young Anthony Steel , a popular British matinée idol of the ' 40s . Emlyn Williams is marvelous as the nosy , annoying veterinarian who keeps stopping by . " Another Man's Poison " seems to have been made rather cheaply - the print I saw was not of great quality , and the lighting is on the dark side . Though the setting is somewhat static because it was originally a play , the film is very intriguing , and Davis always worth seeing . Highly recommended .
The French fight to keep their art away from the Nazis	John Frankenheimer's 1964 film , " The Train , " is the story of the French resistance in the final days of the war as they try to keep a train carrying their valuable art from leaving France . In reality , the Germans did transform the Jeu de Paume museum into one of their primary storage facilities for art confiscated in France - - mainly from Jewish families . A French official , Rose Valland recorded the Nazis ' activities in the museum throughout the Occupation . As the Nazis fled Paris , a final train bearing valuable art from the Jeu de Paume did depart for Germany , and the French did scramble to intervene . The Free French team sent to stop the shipment was led by Alexandre Rosenberg . He was the son of Paul Rosenberg , the dealer of Braque , Leger , Matisse and Picasso , and after he succeeded in halting the train by blowing up the surrounding tracks , Alexandre found it filled with works from his father's gallery . In the story , the brilliant Paul Scofield is Col . von Waldheim , an art lover ( actually a composite of several Nazi generals ) arranges to have the French art moved into Germany before the arrival of the Allies . The curator appeals to the resistance , and one their head , Labiche ( Burt Lancaster ) is opposed to letting anyone die in the defense of objects . But when his friend Boule , the train's conductor , is killed by the Nazis , Labiche changes his mind . The resistance puts into place a diabolical plan to delay the train until the Allies arrive . " The Train " is an exciting , suspenseful , and fast-paced film that captures the tension and danger that resistance members no doubt felt in their work , and the film highlights the sacrifices that were made . Jeanne Moreau , as the reluctant hotelier Christine , heads an excellent supporting cast made up predominantly of French actors . With Lancaster and Scofield , the battle for the French soul is a well-matched one . Both are powerful actors ; both play determined , resourceful men . Acting-wise , their styles are different but no less effective . They make great enemies . Don't miss " The Train , " with its great script and fantastic direction by Frankenheimer .
exciting spectacle from MGM	MGM pulled out all the stops for this 1948 version of " The Three Musketeers . " Filmed in color and directed by George Sidney , it has a large , all-star cast consisting of Gene Kelly , Lana Turner , June Allyson , Van Heflin , Cornell Wilde , Vincent Price , Angela Lansbury , Robert Coote , Frank Morgan , Keenan Wynn and John Sutton . Gene Kelly is D'Artagnan , who arrives to join the Musketeers and ends up having to fight three duels in a day with Athos ( Heflin ) , Porthos ( Young ) and Aramis ( Coote ) . They all wind up friends . The Musketeers ' first assignment is to steal the Queen's jewels back for her - a gift of twelve diamond studs from her husband ( Morgan ) . She has given them to her lover , the Duke of Buckingham , but now needs them back to wear in nine days ' time . Cardinal Richlieu ( Price ) , anxious to reveal the secret relationship between the two , dispatches his evil mistress , Lady De Winter ( Turner ) to steal two of the studs . Richlieu wants France to declare war against England and completely destroy the King's powers . The Musketeers have to get the jewels from the Duke and return with them to Paris . With two diamond studs missing , they have an added task of picking up two replacements from a jeweler and getting them to the Queen in time to wear them at a banquet . In the process of all of this , D'Artagnan falls in love with the Queen's lady-in-waiting , Constance ( Allyson ) . All of the acting is wonderful , with the role of Lady De Winter expanded from the original book . Lana Turner is perfect as De Winter - gorgeous , cool , irresistible and deadly . The scenes between Constance and De Winter toward the end of the film are among the best in the movie , very suspenseful ( and different from the book ) . Turner to me looks carefully made up to hide some extra pounds , not to mention being tightly corsetted . The movie was filmed right after Lana had broken up with the great love of her life , Tyrone Power , which may have had something to do with it . Van Heflin is sympathetic and strong as Athos , who has a past with De Winter and still loves her , and Vincent Price makes an excellent Cardinal Richlieu . Gene Kelly is the ideal D'Artagnan , and his casting is very clever , giving him a chance to show the great athleticism that contributed so much to his dancing . His swordplay is amazing , really making the swordfights entertaining . Though the role has very serious moments , Kelly gives it a lightness and humor when needed . Especially fun is the scene where D'Artagnan , in the dark , poses as Lady De Winter's lover . There are , as mentioned , many versions of this Dumas classic . This one is vividly entertaining , colorful and energetic , with a very attractive cast , good direction , and a thrilling score . Highly recommended .
The discovery of one falsehood leads to lots more	Hayden Christensen is the " Shattered Glass " in the title of this 2003 film , co-starring Peter Sarsgaard , Chloë Sevigny , and Rosario Dawson . Well-directed and co-written by Billy Ray , the film tells the story of Stephen Glass , a young reporter for The New Republic who was a rising , well-liked and vibrant journalist . Working under editor Michael Kelly , he wrote some excellent and off-beat stories for The New Republic . When Kelly is fired , Chuck Lane ( Peter Sarsgaard ) takes over as editor . He doesn't have the close relationship with the young journalists that Kelly did , and when an online magazine questions some of the facts in an article written by Glass , Sarsgaard is perhaps a little less protective than Kelly would have been and starts digging into it . Glass eventually states that he seems to have been duped by his sources , but Lane begins to think he fabricated the story . He then looks into some other stories written by Glass . A really excellent , low-key film that dramatizes the tangled web that emerges and only gets more tangled as time goes on . Christensen is excellent as a confident young man who keeps up his bravado but internally panics as his story is questioned and he feels the pressure intensify . The tight-lipped Sarsgaard underplays but as his outrage grows , you can literally see him start to seethe . Highly recommended , " Shattered Glass " is a very good film , with the ending chirons updating the story .
Excellent film chronicling the nurses on Bataan	Claudette Colbert heads up a team of army nurses caring for the wounded and dying in " So Proudly We Hail ! " It's a great ensemble of fine actresses , including Paulette Goddard , Veronica Lake , Barbara Britton and others . This is the women's story , not often told , but certainly harrowing and inspiring . These nurses are in the Phillipines when MacArthur pulls out and they become stranded on Corregidor . The film is told in flashbacks , when the women are actually on their way home by ship , and Colbert , who plays " Davy " ( Janet Davidson ) is catatonic . The ship's doctor is trying to figure out how to help her and asks the women to tell their story . It's a rough one , filled with bombings , filth , malaria , little food , exhaustion , and dying . When " So Proudly We Hail ! " was released , no one knew how the war would end as we do now , and the fall of the Philippines was seen as a major defeat for the U . S . I suspect that although the impact of seeing it today is very strong , it must have been a lot stronger for wartime audiences . As mentioned , it was wartime , so Hollywood didn't have a lot of men to choose from . George Reeves - today himself the subject of a film - plays Davy's love interest , John , and he's not only hunky but excellent . I couldn't figure out if he had a good speaking voice or I was just so used to hearing it after growing up with " Superman . " But he's very effective , and it's sad that after serving in the war , he couldn't get his career back on track . Unfortunately , that happened to many actors who were just getting a foothold when war broke out . The other actor is the often maligned Sonny Tufts , a big , good looking blond who wasn't much of an actor , but he doesn't detract from the film either . He was probably more suited to this role than he was to others later on . But this is a women's movie all the way . At 40 , Colbert was probably a little old for the role . However , she does a good job as a tough but motherly woman , protective of her nurses and quite the rule-breaker herself after she meets John . Veronica Lake gives what is perhaps her best performance as the angry Olivia . The supporting Oscar nomination should have gone to her - it's a showy role , and she does a fantastic job . Paulette Goddard did receive the nomination . She's a flirty , sexy man magnet and extremely likable . I've always thought in real life , with all that charm and charisma , she must have had to beat men off with a stick . " So Proudly We Hail ! " gives as realistic a depiction of the conditions of war and the tremendous work of the nurses who served . It covers the same material as the excellent " Cry Havoc ! " - also about nurses on Bataan . I highly recommend both films . As a bit of trivia , there were nurses who did not get out of Corregidor and were captured . They worked in the prison hospitals and had to endure terrible conditions , but surprisingly , they did survive - a tribute to their incredible inner strength and devotion to the wounded .
Wonderful spy film	Michael Caine is Harry Palmer , the spy who came in to get out of the cold , in " The Ipcress File , " a non-Bond type spy film set in London . Filmed on location , it really captures the London of the ' 60s and the back office drudgery of the intelligence game . Caine is not your average spy , in fact , he's doing the job to keep from going to prison . But he's very well suited to it . In the first scenes , we see a guard put a scientist on a train , but he's forgotten his camera . When the guard returns to the train to give it to him , the scientist is gone and someone else is in his place . Thus begins the work of getting him back and ferreting out a double agent . The film , based on the Deighton novel , probably reflects the Profumo scandal that rocked Britain , and shows the smart , patriotic boys to be the Caines of the world and not the traitorous upper crust . Caine is excellent as Palmer - dry , funny , and clever , all the while cooking gourmet food , shopping for only the best , and listening to Mozart . He's a class act - the wrong class in a class-conscious society , but the best class to do the job that needs to be done .
H . G . Wells ' fantasy of time travel	Rod Taylor boards a contraption he built and goes forward in history in " The Time Machine , " a 1960 film also starring Alan Young as Filby , Yvette Mimieux , Sebastian Cabot , and Whit Bissell . Taylor plays George , who is in actuality H . G . Wells , who wrote the book on which the film is based . He's built a strange-looking thing that propels him through space into the future , and on New Year's Eve of 1899 , that's just what he does . He watches the store mannequin across the street change styles until suddenly , in 1917 , his house is bathed in darkness from being boarded up . Going outside , he meets Filby's son , whom he also meets as an old man in 1966 during an atomic war . Finally he lands way , way into the future and finds a land filled with blond youths who seem to have no feelings . He falls for one of them , Weena , who says she is an Eloi , and he eventually learns about the Morlocks , who live below and control the Eloi . Shot in color and directed by George Pal , " The Time Machine " has some fantastic effects and a good story . Whether it's the story Wells wrote , I can't say . According to one comment , Wells ' point was entirely missed . So the film has to be judged on its own merits . All the doom and gloom seen in the future is apparently not new - that's a comfort since we're all still here . The story manages to have the trappings of sci fi as well as being moving in sections , particularly in the friendship of Filby and George . The best part and the best performance belong to Young , and I believe this is his favorite film . He plays Filby , his son , and his young son as an old man very well , the old man having the showiest material . Taylor makes a good leading man . Mimieux doesn't have much to do except look pretty and be passive . Again , going back to one of the comments , the ending is pure Hollywood . " The Time Machine " film , however , is very entertaining . Best not to compare it to the book , I guess .
Great thriller	Harrison Ford is " The Fugitive " in this 1993 version of the popular television series . The film also stars Tommy Lee Jones as Gerard , Sela Ward , Julianne Moore and Joe Pantoliano . For you young ' uns out there , " The Fugitive " TV show starring David Janssen was based on the 1954 Sam Sheppard case , the subject itself of 10 books and two movies . Dr . Sheppard . accused of murdering his wife , claimed to have seen a " bushy-haired man " at the scene . It was a landmark case , resulting in the creation of the " change of venue " motion . The film " The Fugitive " keeps the basics : Dr . Richard Kimble , en route to prison to await execution for the murder of his wife ( Ward ) , escapes after a terrible accident . On his trail from the beginning is a U . S . Marshall , Sam Gerard . Both men have way above average intelligence , so while Gerard is able to get close , Kimble always eludes him . After stealing clothes , shaving his beard and dying his hair , Kimble goes to the hospital where he worked and gets into the computer database to find the one-armed man . He knows he injured the man's arm in a fight , and repair of the arm would have necessitated a visit . This is a real on the edge of your seat thriller , with an absolutely spectacular beginning sequence that grabs the audience and doesn't let go . In the TV series , the one-armed man is an intruder ; here , a different storyline has been added , and it's quite good . One of my favorite parts occurs when Kimble , disguised as a janitor at the hospital , overhears an incorrect diagnosis for a young boy . Because the ER is so busy and there is no one available , he's asked to take the child to another floor . While doing so , he conducts his own quick examination and writes a change of orders ; the boy ends up in surgery . The OR doc ( Moore ) catches Kimble looking at the child's x-ray , and when she learns the boy never arrived at his destination , alerts security . Gerard asks her later , " What happened to the boy ? " " He saved his life , " Moore says . Both Ford and Jones are at the top of their games and very well matched , Jones bringing a lot of humor to his role as the determined Gerard . Ford looks a little like the Ape Man in the beginning with all the facial hair ; as Kimble , he's sympathetic and his desperation and determination are more internalized than Gerard's . It wasn't until 1998 that DNA evidence finally exonerated Sheppard , who was released in 1966 after a retrial ( in the original trial , the judge told reporter Dorothy Kilgallen that Sheppard was guilty ) . Sheppard died in 1970 , his life ruined . Fifty years after the case , it continues to influence courtroom proceedings and inspire books and films . This " Fugitive " is particularly excellent .
A much loved film	At the beginning of Britain's entry into World War II , an officer walks across Waterloo Bridge and remembers the love of his life from World War I in " Waterloo Bridge , " starring Vivien Leigh as Myra and Robert Taylor as Roy . Leigh is a beautiful ballerina who meets the dashing , handsome Taylor in an air raid shelter ; love and tragedy follow . Believing her fiancée dead , fired from the ballet company , and her roommate turning tricks , Leigh , unable to find any other job , turns to the same life . Heavily made up and cheaply dressed , she's in Waterloo Station doing the " hello , soldier " thing when who should appear but Roy . He wants to take up where they left off and continue down the aisle . This is the type of movie one both loves and hates . Two of Hollywood's most dazzling stars , dancing to candlelight , involved in a beautiful romance - but she falls from grace and has to pay . It's unfair . Ditto Myrna Loy in " The Rains Came " and a million other movies . Leigh was such a wonderful actress . Fresh and vibrant in the beginning of the movie , she manages with a cold , hard facial expression to show that she's changed . Her guilt , her sorrow , her self-loathing are all deeply felt , yet she wants to believe she has a chance at happiness , and you can actually see the moments where she tries to talk herself into it . Robert Taylor is very good , though one can really see Olivier in this role . The part isn't as well structured as Leigh's and Olivier may have been able to mine it more . The camera loves Taylor , and his scene at the end of the film is extremely touching . Virginia Field is marvelous as Kitty , Leigh's true friend . This is a film that stays with you long after it's over . And the next time you hear the word " Waterloo , " trust me , you won't think of Napoleon . You'll think of " Waterloo Bridge . "
Good soap , filled with now-familiar faces	Ryan's Hope , the story of the Ryan family , was a wonderful show filmed in New York City , thereby giving it the advantage of some veteran stage actors as well as newcomers . The cast was led by the amazing Helen Gallagher , a great musical theater star , as the matriarch of the Ryan family , Maeve . Maeve and her husband Johnny ( the late Bernard Barrow ) ran a bar / restaurant and were the linchpins of the soap . Their children were Frank , Mary , Siobhan , Patrick , and the seldom seen Kathleen . The Coleridges - attorney Jillian and two doctors , Faith and Roger - were the other family , a bit higher in class but nevertheless closely tied to the Ryans . Along the way , many young actors cut their teeth on " Ryan's Hope " - Kate Mulgrew , Daniel Hugh Kelly , Corbin Bernsen , Marg Helgenberger , Ilene Kirstin , Gordon Thomson , Roscoe Born , Earl Hindman and Ron Hale , to name just a few . Today Hale and Kirstin are still soap actors , as was Roscoe Born until recently , while Hindman , Mulgrew , Bersen , Daniel Hugh Kelly and Helgenberger went on to TV series fame ( Hindman was the neighbor in " Home Improvement " ) . In the beginning , the great interest ( for me anyway ) was the love story between sexy reporter Jack Fenelli ( Michael Levin ) and Mary Ryan ( Kate Mulgrew ) . The character of Frank started out with an older actor - Christian Slater's father , if memory serves - and there were several Franks , the best remembered probably being Daniel Hugh Kelly . The beautiful , classy Nancy Addison , unfortunately now deceased , was Jill Coleridge throughout the series , and Hale was her brother Roger . Their sister , Faith , was played by more the one actress , the most memorable being Karen Morris Gowdy ( now a Connecticut socialite ) . Delia , Frank's wife and ultimately ex-wife , and Roger's wife and ultimately ex-wife , and a royal pain , was played by both Randall Edwards and Ilene Kirstin , more successfully by Kirstin , in my opinion . The series had some interesting plots . Two I especially liked were the Gordon Thomson story arc where he played Alexander Benedict White , an Egyptologist who becomes involved with Faith in an intriguing story ; and the other involved a relative of the Ryan's , E . J . , an ambitious reporter trying to find out if a soap actress , Barbara Wilding , is faking leg paralysis . Unfortunately for me , Soapnet stopped the series in 1981 - in the middle of both of these plots . The word is that they are going to continue the series this time around . Let's hope . " Ryan's Hope " started to lose steam around 1983 and limped to cancellation in 1989 . But seeing it on Soapnet , one is reminded of how good it was at least from 1975-1983 , before it became influenced by the breakout success of " General Hospital " and veered from its original structure . At its best , " Ryan's Hope " was more like the English soaps such as Crossroads - about the middle class in a big city , their lives and loves .
Poirot in top form	David Suchet is Agatha Christie's mustached detective Hercule Poirot in " After the Funeral , " produced in 2005 . Anyone who has heard David Suchet speak with his own British accent knows what a shock it is , because his accent as Poirot is so perfect and organic to the character . Suchet is the Poirot of Agatha Christie's books , and although I confess a love for Peter Ustinov in the role , his portrayal doesn't have that much to do with what Christie wrote . In this episode , Poirot is asked by a solicitor friend to investigate the possible murder of one of his clients . Enroute on the train , the solicitor recounts the events after the death - a strange will disinheriting the expected heir and the pronouncement of the man's sister that he was murdered . When Poirot meets the family , he discovers adultery , lots of secrets , another will and murder . The story is excellent with rich production values and a wonderful , detailed depiction of the time period . All of the acting is superb , particularly from Monica Dolan , who plays Miss Gilchrist . Poirot here is without Hastings , his beautiful office , or Miss Lemon but he's effective nonetheless . I had the privilege of seeing David Suchet on Broadway in " Amadeus . " Breathtaking . What an actor - when he's playing Poirot , all I see IS Poirot .
home movies - a truly lovely documentary	I never knew that John Mills began his career as a song and dance man until I saw his documentary , " Sir John Mills ' Moving Memories " done in 2000 . Part biography , part filmography , part home movies , this is a delightful look at the actor , his family and his friends over the years . His children , Juliet , Hayley and Jonathan talk about growing up in different houses and being on various film sets and on vacation ; Mills talks about his career , his life and his marriage , with much film taken behind the scenes of various films and of stars visiting his home - Stewart Granger , Jean Simmons , Tyrone Power , David Niven , Dirk Bogarde , Sir Laurence Olivier , Vivien Leigh , Joan Plowright , Ian McShane and many others . Most poignant is Mills singing a love song to his wife ; at the time , unlike shots of her as a vibrant , happy redhead in many of his movies , she seems somewhat out of it but attentive - a sad and beautiful moment . For those of us who are baby boomers and for whom John Mills was merely Hayley's father while we were growing up , this is a wonderful look at a distinguished family of actors and one of the finest British actors , John Mills , from the time he was a young man . It's always bittersweet to see the story of someone's life from youth to old age but in this case , it was a triumphant life and well worth experiencing .
Pre-code Stanwyck ROCKS	" Baby Face " is a precode melodrama starring a very young Barbara Stanwyck , an almost unrecognizable George Brent , and Theresa Harris . It's about a girl who goes to the city to make good . . . or should I say make time . Stanwyck's father has been pimping her for one reason or another her whole life in dingy , depressed , filthy Erie , Pennsylvania . After her father dies , one older father type who knows what she's been through and truly cares about her future advises her to go to the big city and take advantage of opportunities there - and not the easy ones - and to take the high road in life . ( Note that I saw the censored version and not the uncut - this part of the film was redone for the censors . ) She and Chico ( Harris ) go to New York where Lily ( nickname : Baby Face ) decides the low road's a lot smoother and will get her where she wants to go a lot faster . In the movie's most famous scene , the camera moves us up the corporate ladder by taking us from floor to floor as Lily sleeps her way to the top . She finally corrals the big man himself and is able to quit her day job . Trouble follows , and she's soon involved in a huge scandal . Stanwyck wears lots of makeup and for most of the film is cool as a cucumber as she seduces one man after another with no regrets , and she's great at playing the innocent victim . In one scene , she sits staring at a king's ransom in jewels while wearing a black dress that looks like it's decorated with diamonds at the top . Then she asks Chico for another case , and that's filled with more jewelry , plus securities . All in a day's work . Theresa Harris was an interesting talent - she could be played down or glamorous , and was a talented singer and dancer as well . Here , she sings or hums the movie's theme , " St . Louis Woman " throughout . She worked in literally dozens of movies and is very good here as a friend of Stanwyck's , her best work being in the precode era . As a bizarre byproduct of the code , blacks were often given less to do in films after it was put in place . Precode films could be more sexually blatant and therefore , though they're 70 + years old , seem more modern . Even though these films didn't have to have moral endings , Baby Face learns her lessons - how like life it is after all . There were several endings of this film , all with the same message . The one I saw had an added scene , but apparently , there were two other endings that didn't pass the censors . ( There wasn't a code but there were always censors . ) At any rate , it's a neat surprise . " Baby Face " is an important film in movie history - a must see .
Really good Holmes entry	" The Scarlet Claw " is an unusual Sherlock Holmes mystery in that it takes place in Canada . Holmes and Watson are in Quebec at an occult society meeting when they hear about a village legend involving a phantom that killed three villagers . There are fears that the phantom has returned - some sheep killed , some strange sitings , and then a woman , Lady Penrose , is found murdered . Lord Penrose ( Paul Cavanagh ) is at the same meeting as Holmes and Watson . Holmes in fact later receives a letter from the woman asking for his help . The detective and his doctor friend then go to investigate , and find a lot more than anyone bargained for - no phantom , but a flesh and blood killer . Good ensemble work , rich atmosphere , and a supernatural story will remind one of Hound of the Baskervilles . While Holmes and Watson have a great adventure in " La Morte Rouge , " the name of the town , it's not quite The Hound of the Baskervilles . It is , however , an excellent - maybe the best - entry into the Universal series , and audiences won't be disappointed .
a knockout punch	I grew up watching Clint Eastwood as Rowdy Yates on " Rawhide . " Who could have imagined , looking at his unlined face and watching his easygoing manner , that he would ever have developed into the filmmaker that he has ? Though we should have known Clint was something special - in those days , it was nearly impossible to move from a hit TV show into films , as the typecasting was even worse than it is today . But Clint did it . Unfortunately for me , I knew the plot and ending of this film before walking into the theater . Because of the staggered release of MDB , it was almost impossible not to . I would have liked to assess the impact not knowing the twists and turns of the plot . That being said , I found this a beautifully-realized story about dreams , courage , and the true meaning of family . The three principals did a tremendous job . Hillary Swank is so much more than an actress . She is able to break a role down down to its simplest elements and becomes the character . There is never anything overdone in her work . She is one of the finest actresses we have . Morgan Freeman is one of the finest actors we have . And Clint Eastwood ? Well , he's just one of the finest directors we have . Congratulations , Rowdy .
Four friends gather to discuss an old crime	" Lesser Evil " is a 1998 film starring Colm Feore , David Paymer , Tony Goldwyn and Arliss Howard . It's very well directed by David Mackay , and the script by Jeremy Levine and Steven Schultze is excellent . The film starts at a funeral presided over by a priest ( Howard ) who then tells the story in flashback . As teenagers , four buddies - Ivan ( the priest , played as a young man by Marc Worden ) , George ( Alan Scott / Paymer ) , Derek ( Jonathan Scarfe / Feore ) and Frank ( Steven Petrarca / Goldwyn ) are being crazed , drunken , out of control lunatics in the woods when George ( Adam Scott / Paymer grown up ) shoots into a car , gravely injuring the driver . The driver has a shotgun on his lap . He also has something else , which is revealed later in the film . The kids become completely hysterical and , as the man isn't dead but seems close to it , they attempt to rush him to a hospital . Then they change their minds and take him back to the woods , where he dies hours later , helped along by one of them when they see police lights . Twenty years later , the gun that killed the man has surfaced , and the police question its owner , Derek ( Feore ) , who has called them all together . George has become an attorney , Frank a police officer , Ivan a priest , and Derek's business is failing . He has made a mess of talking to the police and is a wreck . Ivan thinks they should go to the police and tell them what happened all those years ago , though they had all made a pact to protect George and keep quiet . Then they realize that George has been getting everything on tape and that Frank has been keeping a big secret from them all these years . Fascinating story of the ramifications of guilt even after " getting away " with something and how guilt molded the lives and personalities of each man and changed their relationships with one another . In that way , it's a tiny bit like " Mystic River . " With Colm Feore in it , the acting can be nothing less than spectacular . He is one of my favorite actors , having seen in perform at Stratford in Canada several times . The leads are all excellent , and the young men who play them as teens are superb . There's a twist at the end . You won't want to miss this superlative drama that could only come from an independent filmmaker , as Hollywood is too busy with cartoon characters and blowing up things .
Based on a true story	Sean Penn plays Sam Bicke who decides to kill President Nixon in " The Assassination of Richard Nixon , " a 2004 film brilliantly directed by Niels Muller , who co-wrote the excellent script with Kevin Kennedy . The film is actually based on a true story and stars Sean Penn , Naomi Watts and Don Cheadle . The story begins with Sam Bicke ( Penn ) writing a letter to Leonard Bernstein which is read throughout the film . Sam Bicke is a man separated from his wife ( Watts ) and two daughters but hoping for a reconciliation . At the beginning of the film , we know he worked once for his successful brother but now is working as a furniture salesman for a blowhard ( Jack Thompson ) who is constantly lecturing him , playing mind games with him , and handing him books by Dale Carnegie while his son ( Brad Henke ) reports everything Sam does to his father . Sam applies for an SBA loan in the hopes of going into the tire business with a friend ( Cheadle ) , similar to what his brother does . It's clear Sam's life is going nowhere , but he retains some illusions ; we watch him unravel as he realizes what the audience has known all along . His wife is soon to be his ex-wife and wants nothing to do with him , and she's seeing somebody else ; his job isn't long for this world ; and he's not going to get the loan . He feels more and more isolated and even tries to join the Black Panthers at one point . Finally he has the psychotic break that's been coming for the whole film . Though Sam does terrible things , his story is so heartbreaking that it's impossible to hate him . In fact , I found myself loathing his wife for her uncaring and unfeeling attitude , though conversely , I understood his brother's rage . And his boss - only a desperate man would have put up with him for five minutes . It seems like Sam is just someone who has fallen through society's cracks , someone no one cares about , no one realizes or cares is damaged and needs help . Unfortunately , there are probably millions of Sam Bickes in this world . He can live only in his own twisted mind , which twists further and further until it explodes . There isn't any question that Sean Penn is one of our greatest American actors . It's fine for people to praise Johnny Depp , who is fantastic and more versatile , but no one can do this kind of heavy drama like Penn can . His characterization is staggering : heartfelt , full of suppressed rage and real agony , desperation and alienation . It is another in his resume of stunning portrayals . There's nothing subtle about Penn's gifts - when he was a kid on Broadway in a flop play , Heartland , it was obvious to audiences that he was going to be a star . As for the rest of the cast , Watts is brilliant and unrecognizable as Bicke's estranged wife , and Jack Thompson is utterly believable as his boss . This is one of those movies that you'll see and won't be able to get out of your head . It breaks your heart .
Sumptuous drama of the royal court of Henry VIII	Richard Burton is Henry VIII and Genevieve Bujold is Anne Boleyn in " Anne of the Thousand Days , " a beautifully acted and brilliant looking film from 1969 , from the play by Maxwell Anderson and directed by Charles Jarrot . Irene Papas is Catherine of Aragon , Anthony Quayle is Cardinal Woolsey , and John Colicos is Thomas Cromwell . Those were the days of " Lion in Winter , " " Becket , " " A Man for all Seasons " - these magnificent productions were all the rage back then , preceding the disaster film rage of the ' 70s . The drama takes us through Henry VIII's manipulations to have his marriage to Catherine of Aragon annulled so that he can marry the beautiful lady-in-waiting , Anne Boleyn , who he is convinced can give him a son . Here was one man who never let the law stand in his way - if he wanted something , he simply changed the law . When all Anne Boleyn can deliver is a daughter , Elizabeth ( who became Queen Elizabeth I ) , he starts looking around and becomes attracted to another lady in waiting , Jane Seymour . Now to see what the law can do about getting rid of Anne . . . Richard Burton is an excellent Henry - a great technician and possessor of a magnificent voice , it's a little hard to tell with him , as it is with Orson Welles , how much of a performance is technique and how much is emotional investment in the role . I'm suspicious that there was a lot of technique at play here . Burton is surrounded by a stunning performance of Anthony Quayle's as Cardinal Woolsey - possibly the best in the film , and the multilayered Anne Boleyn of Genevieve Bujold . Her Anne is an innocent young girl at the start , but one soon realizes she has a spine of iron , refusing to have anything to do with Henry as long as he is married to Catherine . Over the course of the film , she falls in love with Henry , matures and becomes a true queen whose only thought in the end is that her daughter will reign and have the last laugh on Henry , who believes a woman cannot rule England . You'll be interested enough in the events of the film to look up the real story afterward - having seen the play Henry VIII , Becket , and A Man for All Seasons , plus remembering a good deal of what I learned in school , as steeped as I was , I don't have Henry's family tree in my head . This film by necessity is less detailed than what really happened in the court of Henry VIII , but it's enough to give you a flavor . And let's face it , you can't make this stuff up .
I LOVE this show !	I've been a devotee of MONK since it started and am ashamed to confess that I just discovered the very funny , very clever PSYCH on USA Network . It's a familiar format - two buddies , a head honcho in the police department who resents them - but it has some great twists . James Roday is Shawn Spencer , an observant detective who somehow is known as a psychic ( I am just renting the entire first season now so I don't have the whole back story ) . Anyway , he's a total fake but boy , can he put on a show . Dule Hill , so wonderful ( and serious ) in West Wing is Shawn's childhood friend and partner Gus . Corbin Bernsen plays Shawn's dad , a former police officer . Tim Omundson is the harried Lassiter . The dialogue is fantastic , and the mysteries are interesting enough . Corbin Bernsen is such a great sport - the show always begins with a flashback to Shawn's childhood , and Bernsen wears a hairpiece ; for the present-day scenes , he's bald . He was considered such a handsome leading man in LA Law - what he is , is an actor who enjoys both leads and character roles , as well as writing and directing . I can't say enough about James Roday's line delivery and his chemistry with Dule Hill . Hill is excellent - whoever would have dreamed he could be so effective doing comedy ? This show is great for what ails you . It will leave you laughing , and these days , you can't ask for better than that .
engrossing documentary about the great director	John Ford is one of our greatest American directors , and he is profiled in this 1971 documentary that features a hilarious interview with the man himself ( Interviewer : How did you shoot that scene ? Ford : With a camera ) and actors who worked with him many times over the years : John Wayne , James Stewart , Henry Fonda , and Maureen O'Hara . Narrated by Orson Welles , prominent directors talk about his influence on cinema and his gifts as a director : Martin Scorcese , Peter Bogdanovich , Steven Spielberg , and Clint Eastwood . The most fascinating part of this documentary was the discussion - with clips - of how the master framed his shots like a painter , and the scenes shown were truly stunning . The end of the documentary speaks to his sentimentality , belief in an afterlife and the family , demonstrated with heartwrenching scenes from " The Searchers , " " How Green was My Valley , " and others . Finally there was a taped meeting between Katharine Hepburn and Ford in the year he died . The two had a great connection and perhaps even a relationship . It is most fascinating , particularly when Ford's son leaves the room and mistakenly leaves the tape recorder on . Excellent all the way around .
Beautiful adaptation	Orson Welles hauls out his " Citizen Kane " corsets to become Mr . Rochester to Joan Fontaine's Jane Eyre in " Jane Eyre , " a lavish 1944 adaptation of the book by Charlotte Bronte . Jane is a poor orphan shuttled from one horrible situation to another - first the home of her cruel aunt ( Agnes Moorhead ) , then to an orphanage run by Henry Brocklehurst . He announces to all that Jane is possessed by the devil and that no one should be involved with her . But one little girl , Helen Burns , played by an absolutely beautiful Elizabeth Taylor , befriends her . Alas , due to the inhumane treatment at the orphanage , Helen dies . With the help of the kind doctor to the orphans , Dr . Rivers ( handsome John Sutton ) Jane sticks it out at the orphanage to receive her education . When they offer her a teaching position there for pennies , she leaves to become the governess for little Adele ( Margaret O'Brien ) at Thornfield , the home of the mysterious , tormented Edward Rochester . O'Brien was one of the most adorable child actors in films , and one of the best performers . Welles couldn't stand her because she was a scene stealer . Mary Astor confessed being afraid of her on " Meet Me in St . Louis . " It's all lost on the audience , as she is wonderful . Welles made a calculated decision to hire himself out as an actor to finance his film work . He makes a magnificent Mr . Rochester - romantic , angry , and magnetic . His resonant voice speaks the dialogue with conviction , and , at 27 , he was able , with a little help , to cut a dashing figure , an advantage that didn't last too much longer . Fontaine is perfect as the subservient , shy , unloved Jane , her soft , plain appearance and breathless voice giving an overall air of dignity and true beauty - at once recognized by Mr . Rochester . There is , however , the matter of Grace Poole . The film is atmospheric - in fact , it may be a tad on the overdone side , but the wind blowing on the moors , the storms , the lightning , the mausoleum-like , cold house all fit the darkness of Mr . Rochester's soul to perfection . Truly there was no one in cinema history quite like Orson Welles - brilliant , eccentric , a profligate spender , and ultimately self-destructive , on the outs with Hollywood and unable to finish any of his later projects . The saddest thing in his biography is the dinner he has with Steven Spielberg , whose help he wants in getting a distributor . Spielberg instead approaches him like a fan and wants to talk about the great films , the great performances , and no offer of help is forthcoming . How heartbreaking for Welles to spend the next 40 years of his life competing with his old dazzling image .
Beloved of God	To be born with the love of music and with great ambition and yet have a mediocre talent ; to hate passionately one with clearly a heavenly gift - that is the story of Amadeus . Directed by Milos Forman and starring F . Murray Abraham , Tom Hulce , Roy Dotrice , Elizabeth Berridge , Jeffrey Jones and Christine Ebersole , this 1984 film is sumptuously produced and made in Prague , certainly one of the most glorious cities in the world . Amadeus is based on a play by Peter Shaeffer and gets its roots from a Rimsky-Korsakov opera . It is the highly fictionalized story of Wolfgang Mozart and another composer of the time , Salieri , who was jealous of Mozart's talent and vowed to bring him down . In reality , the two men were colleagues , and the story is really a what-if . However , as a friend of mine returning from a concert where Salieri's music was performed said , " By the way , I can believe Salieri killed Mozart , if this was the best he could come up with . " It certainly would be amazing if other composers alive during that period were not aware of the child prodigy and his prolific compositions . It would be more amazing if they weren't just a little jealous . The story is told by the institutionalized Salieri ( Abraham ) to a priest , and we see Mozart ( Tom Hulce ) from his point of view : as an eccentric , lascivious , ill-behaved young man whose behavior belies his great talent . He attempts to ruin Mozart , even using the influence Mozart's own late father had over him by disguising himself in a huge black cloak as Mozart Sr . wore and commissioning Mozart to write a Requiem . The performances are exquisite , and one can really feel Salieri's pain as exhibited brilliantly by F . Murray Abraham . One empathizes with his anger toward , jealousy of and contradictory admiration for Mozart . Mozart himself is depicted as an idiot on whom musical talent was randomly bestowed . Tom Hulce's laugh as Mozart is unforgettable , as is his chasing Constanze , who became his wife , under a piano . As the film goes on , much of this wild behavior grows less , and the audience is permitted to see Mozart the genius , with a million notes in his head , dictating from his sick bed , and soberly conducting his music . The real star of Amadeus is the music , lushly performed , the vocal music ranging from his simple Caro Mio Bene to Abduction from the Seraglio , The Marriage of Figaro , Don Giovanni and The Magic Flute and the orchestral from symphonies , concertos , Eine Kleine Nachtmusik and , of course , his Requiem . Amadeus is a feast for the eyes and a thrill for the ears . It is a thought-provoking film about genius , mediocrity and immortality .
beautiful story , excellently crafted	This was one of the best TV movies ever produced . A very compelling story about a young woman who comes back home after an absence of many years . The question is , is she or isn't she ? This film turns out to be about a lot more than an identity question . The young woman , who may or may not be Caroline , becomes involved with her physically challenged half-sister , her brother , and the stepmother that keeps the little girl a baby . Whoever Caroline is , she changes this family in profound ways . The ending , as well as the revelations about Caroline , is wonderful and positively transcendent . I highly recommend this film to anyone . It sports a wonderful cast , including Stephanie Zimbalist , Pamela Reed , and George Grizzard . It will both touch you and intrigue you .
love it	This is another of my favorite Columbos . It sports a top-notch cast , including John Cassavetes , who was never handsomer or sexier , Anjanette Comer , Myrna Loy , and Blythe Danner . Now here's something I've always wondered - had Gwenyth Paltrow been born when this episode was shot , or was Danner pregnant at the time ? Thanks to IMDb , I have my answer - she was five months ' pregnant . Now I can really feel ancient . Cassavetes plays a brilliant conductor whose marriage to Danner was apparently to use the social connections of her mother ( Loy ) . He has a mistress on the side , Anjanette Comer , a prominent pianist , but she announces she wants more . She's sick of being back street . On the night of their concert , he gets rid of her and makes it look like suicide . Columbo picks up a few problems immediately . One thing he notices : " You have a beautiful woman here - bedroom eyes - she has money , a body , and a career . Where's the man ? " It's wonderful to see Falk and good friend Cassavetes together .
