One bad joke and a gay Martian .	' Dumb Dicks ' is as dire as its title . I wanted to see this comedy short ( from the obscure RKO-Pathe stable ) because I knew Benny Rubin , who worked consistently in showbiz from vaudeville into the 1970s , yet never attained stardom : this awful short movie is one of his few lead roles . ( Lead ? More like leaden . ) I've never found Harry Gribbon funny , and he has weakened at least one good comedy for me - - ' Show People ' - - with his antics . Here , Rubin and Gribbon are detectives who snooze in their car outside the Lafayette National Bank during a very loud robbery . In the first two minutes of this movie , something like three hundred gunshots are fired . . . all of them fortissimo . All the gags in this movie are witless , but I'll decipher one gag which modern audiences would probably miss . While their car is parked outside the aforementioned savings institution , Rubin tells Gribbon that they need to get to the Lafayette National Bank . Gribbon looks round , sees where they are , and announces : ' Lafayette . . . we're here already ! ' In 1931 , American audiences would have recognised this line as a reference to " Lafayette , we are here " . . . a patriotic catchphrase from the previous World War . However , I'd bet solid money that even audiences who ' got ' this so-called joke back in 1931 didn't think it was funny . In a couple of previous IMDb reviews , I've made unfavourable comments about Billy Franey , an untalented silent-film comedian . Franey played the title role in the unfunny 1921 film ' The Janitor ' . Now here it is ten years later , and Billy Franey is still playing a janitor in ' Dumb Dicks ' . He isn't funny here , either . I was hoping at least to hear his voice . Several silent-era comedians saw their careers die because their voices were unsuitable for talkies . . . but Franey's career had long since peaked before talkies arrived . Anyroad , it turns out that the leader of the robbery gang is a crimelord named Jabez , so Rubin and Gribbon go to Jabez's secret hideout ( I guess it's listed in the Yellow Pages , under " Secret Hideouts " ) , and they ponce right in through the front door wearing ridiculous disguises . The one and only thing I found intriguing about this dim movie ( besides the fact that I'd known Benny Rubin personally ) is that the chief villain Jabez is played by Ivan Linow . This huge burly Latvian immigrant was just beginning to develop an interesting career as a character actor at the end of the silent era , when his thick accent put paid to his chances . ( And the talkies also revealed that he wasn't much of an actor . ) In 1930 , Linow gave a fine performance in ' The Unholy Three ' ( as one-third of that trio ) , then gave a bizarre performance in ' Just Imagine ' as a gay Martian ! Linow was so good in this role , he could have been typecast playing gay Martians . Sadly , that proved to be the peak of his career , and a few months later Linow was appearing in rubbish like ' Dumb Dicks ' . Still , he gives the best performance in this movie . My rating for ' Dumb Dicks ' : just . If you watch it on a VCR or DVD player , keep the volume turned well down during the opening sequence until the shooting stops .
Close the shutters , pull the drapes .	The 1987 suspense film ' The Bedroom Window ' has one of the most ingenious premises I've ever seen . We know the killer's identity all along , but we can't guess what will happen next . This 1924 movie ( otherwise totally unrelated ) has the same title , but this ' Bedroom Window ' is meant to be a whodunnit rather than a suspense film . Unfortunately , it fails on all counts . ' The Bedroom Window ' ( 1924 version ) is directed by William C . de Mille ( lower case ' de ' ) , who conclusively proves here that he's far less talented than his brother Cecil B . ( upper case ' De ' ) DeMille . Unappealing actress Ethel Wales plays Matilda Jones , who writes best-selling mystery novels under the name Rufus Rome . We know she writes best-sellers , because at regular intervals she receives cheques for $5 , 000 . ( I doubt that many authors in 1924 made this much . ) When her neighbour James Martin is killed by a bullet fired through his bedroom window , Matilda decides to solve the case herself . ( The police have the day off , apparently . ) She dons a weird chequerwork costume which is apparently meant to be the female equivalent of Sherlock's deerstalker , then she promptly breaks into the crime scene . To recreate the fatal bullet's path , she climbs in through the bedroom window . When anybody challenges her sleuth credentials , she haughtily announces ' I'm Rufus Rome ! ' So that's all right , then . Handsome Ricardo Cortez plays Bob Delano , a local schlub who gets arrested for the murder . We see Bob cooling his heels in a nice roomy gaol that looks like a pleasant place to spend the weekend . Bob's girlfriend is the murdered man's daughter Ruth , played by May McAvoy : a very pretty blonde with no discernible acting talent . Some unfortunate ' comic ' relief is supplied by Mattie Peters as a stereotypical black maidservant . This movie reminds me of a very bad episode of ' Murder , She Wrote ' . There's an attempt at a genuine mystery here , with clues for the audience to discover . . . but there are huge gaps in the script's logic , and the identity of the murderer is painfully obvious . . . largely due to the bad acting of all concerned . This movie would have been better if none of the cast had been tipped off in advance to the murderer's identity . I'll rate this ' Bedroom Window ' only 1 point out of 10 . Skip this clinker and rent the splendid 1987 movie with the same title .
William Bendix meets Alec Guinness	In 1953 , Alec Guinness starred in an hilarious movie called " The Captain's Paradise " . Guinness played the bigamous captain of a ferry that plied back and forth across the Straits of Gibraltar . . . bigamous , because Guinness's captain had a wife at each end of his ferry route , with neither wife suspecting the other's existence . In 1958 , " The Captain's Paradise " became a flop Broadway musical renamed " Oh ! Captain ! " , starring Tony Randall in the title role . ( I have difficulty imagining Tony Randall as a man with two wives . ) Amazingly , the 1945 movie ' Don Juan Quilligan ' did this idea first . . . and worst , because this movie is much less funny than the Guinness version . Having read the book and lyrics of " Oh ! Captain ! " , I'm prepared to state that the Broadway musical flop ( which I never saw ) was probably funnier than this movie too . The title role in ' Don Juan Quilligan ' is played by William Bendix , an actor who has frequently dazzled me with his comedy performances . Bendix's set-piece routine with a revolver in ' A Connecticut Yankee ' ( 1949 ) is one of the funniest scenes ever filmed , full stop . Working opposite Abbott and Costello in ' Who Done It ? ' ( 1942 ) , Bendix upstaged Bud and Lou so uproariously that Costello refused ever to work with Bendix again . When I learnt that ' Don Juan Quilligan ' starred Bill Bendix , I was all set to laugh myself into conniptions . I'm still waiting . As Chester A . Riley would say : ' Dis movie ain't funny , Peg . ' Bendix ( who was raised in Manhattan but had a fine career as Hollywood's quintessential Brooklynite ) plays a Brooklyn seaman who captains a scow that runs between Flatbush and Utica . As in " The Captain's Paradise " , he has a wife in each of his two ports . And the difference between the two wives in that film is EXACTLY the same as the difference between the two wives in THIS film : Quilligan has one wife who's a cosy domestic homemaker ( Mary Treen ) , and one wife who's a hot mama ( Joan Blondell ) . Well , there is ONE difference : the wives in " The Captain's Paradise " were a blonde and a brunette . In this movie , they're both blondes . Part of the problem with " Quilligan " is that Blondell's character is supposed to be sexy and vivacious . I've always found Blondell cheap and vulgar in all her roles , and that goes double here . Mary Treen was an underrated actress ( she was quietly splendid in her small role as James Stewart's cousin and workmate in ' It's a Wonderful Life ' ) , and I'm annoyed that the script and direction of ' Quilligan ' have Treen's character playing very much a second fiddle to Blondell's . I wanted Bendix to shove Blondell over the starboard fo'c'sle and sail off into the sunset with Mary Treen . Instead , we get a stupid plot in which bigamous Bendix accidentally enlists in the Army AND the Navy , and then he gets arrested for murder . No , wait , this is Brooklyn : he gets arrested fah moider . I usually enjoy comedy based on Brooklyn stereotypes , but this movie relies heavily on ' deeze-dem-doze ' accents and references to Brooklyn geography , with very little actual humour . Some genuine humour is supplied by Phil Silvers as Bendix's first mate aboard the scow . ( With a plotline like this , I hesitate to use a term like ' first mate ' . ) But Silvers's laughs are few and far between , and that's the fault of the script and the direction . This movie is comatosely directed by Frank Tuttle , who made a couple of good movies and one brilliant movie ( ' Puritan Passions ' ) but who for most of his career was a lacklustre hack . Gravel-voiced B . S . Pulley is prominently featured in this movie . Pulley ( in real life a borderline criminal and all-round Broadway character ) was one of those " naturals " who was very funny when he simply played himself and didn't make any attempts to " act " . Unfortunately , Pulley had delusions of being a thespian , and directors often had to struggle to prevent him from " performing " his roles instead of simply DOING them . Tuttle doesn't make that effort , so Pulley is awful here . Almost as bad is Byron Foulger , whom I've found painfully unfunny in every film role I've ever seen him in . Except for Silvers and Treen , almost everyone in this film is awful , including the usually reliable Bendix . What a disappointment . I rate this garbage scow 1 point out of 10 . I'll moider da bum !
Her missionary position .	Robert Hichens was a prolific author who is now almost utterly forgotten except for his ghost story ' How Love Came to Professor Guildea ' , which is widely anthologised . The first time I read that story , it quite bored me . Years later , I read it again and was deeply horrified . ' The Voice from the Minaret ' is a film based on a Hichens novel which I haven't read . This film is a shallow and bathetic soap opera , which impressed me only for some elaborate ( but unconvincing ) sets . Maybe if I wait a few years and see this movie again , it will impress me . . . as Hichens's ghost story did , the second time round . Somehow , I rather doubt it . SPOILERS THROUGHOUT . Lady Adrienne Carlyle ( Norma Talmadge ) is the wife of the colonial governor of Bombay , played by Edwin Stevens in Snidely Whiplash mode . When Lady Carlyle learns that her husband is playing footsie with the Countess La Fontaine ( apparently Bombay is knee-deep in bluebloods ) , she hops the next steamship bound for Southampton , intending to get a divorce in England . Aboard ship , she meets handsome Andrew Fabian , and the two of them start knockin ' boots in Lady Carlyle's stateroom . Erm , but it turns out that Fabian is a missionary , bound for Port Said to convert the heathens . No problem : Lady Carlyle jumps ship with him , and the two of them carry on knockin ' boots in Damascus . Presumably in the missionary position . Out of the canebrakes comes a bishop who persuades the two sinners to repent . Lady Carlyle and Fabian , shamefaced , go their separate ways . Then Lord Carlyle conveniently pops his clogs . Happy endings all round , as Lady Carlyle and her preacher-man scurry to the nearest choir loft . . . where they can be married without the stigma of a divorce for Lady Carlyle . What a load of cobblers ! Some of the sets feature some impressive chinoiserie , but I never for an instant believed that these characters were in Bombay , Port Said , aboard an ocean liner , or in any place other than a Hollywood set . Talmadge overacts rather direly , and it's only because Edwin Stevens's histrionics are even worse that Talmadge is acceptable at all . The self-righteous and hypocritical ending doesn't help . I'll rate this movie one point in 10 , purely for the art direction and some decent photography .
Not a feature that's stirring . . .	UPDATE : Gentle readers , do not be fooled by the fact that this IMDb review has received so many negative ( un - " useful " votes ) . ALL of those votes were cast by the same person , a very sad individual with too much free time on his hands . . . who sends me emails at regular intervals , demanding that I change this review to make it more favourable . Now , here's my review : Oh , what a piece of crap is this . Why do American television companies see Christmas as an opportunity to produce so many crap-awful specials ? In Britain , Christmas is just an opportunity for the TV stations to show a James Bond movie . I ought to have been warned off watching " ' Twas the Night Before Christmas " when I saw that it was produced by Rankin / Bass , a production company that has churned out far too much unwatchable rubbish . But I'm a great fan of Tammy Grimes and Joel Grey , and John McGiver is very high on my list of all-time favourite character actors , so I sought out this animated film when I saw that they were listed in the cast . This story is awful . It's intended for kids , but kids deserve something better than this . The animation is terrible : far below Rankin / Bass's usual wretched standard . Joel Grey and Tammy Grimes are wasted in badly-written roles . Tammy Grimes was a very sexy actress with a very distinctive voice ( and a cod accent ) , so it's disturbing to hear her voice issuing from the badly-animated mouth of a badly-drawn MALE character . Worst of all is the character written for poor John McGiver . He plays a blowhard mayor , and the scriptwriter has given McGiver a terrible gimmick which is difficult to perform and not funny at all . Every single time McGiver speaks , his character launches into a bombastic speech with lots of long complicated esoteric sesquipedalian words , but invariably he gives up the struggle halfway through the sentence , says ' Aw , heck ! ' and then uses plain speaking to say what he'd meant to say in the first place . I always considered McGiver a brilliant actor , but he can't transcend this terrible running gag which isn't funny . I give somebody some credit for casting George Gobel in the lead role of a mouse . Gobel was a very self-effacing actor who deserved to be better known , and who was ( elsewhere , not here ) extremely funny in a soft-spoken and low-key way . His established persona fits perfectly with the mouse character he plays here . Too bad it's so terribly written . This cartoon is ostensibly based on the famous poem " A Visit from St Nicholas " , known incorrectly as " ' Twas the Night Before Christmas " and traditionally credited to Clement Moore . . . but the link is very tenuous indeed . ( The poem mentions a mouse , and this cartoon is full of talking mice . ) On top of everything else , we now have solid evidence that Clement Moore stole the credit for this poem , which was originally published anonymously . In the year 2001 , a letter surfaced which Moore wrote to the editors of the newspaper that originally published this poem , asking whether any of the editors knew the name of the poem's author . When they replied that they did not , Moore waited until the death of the poem's true author , and then he took credit . None of Clement Moore's own poems show even a glimmer of the talent present in " ' Twas the Night Before Christmas " . . . by which I mean the poem , not this terrible animated cartoon . There is substantial forensic evidence that the true author of this beloved poem was Major Henry Livingston , Jnr , scion of a patriotic family that helped finance the American Revolution . Parents , let your kids do anything at all on Christmas rather than letting them watch this horrible cartoon . It will turn their brains into figgy pudding . I'll rate " ' Twas the Night Before Christmas " zero points out of 10 . Bah , humbug !
" When they catch Dillinger . . . "	' Going Spanish ' is Bob Hope's film debut , and ( as reviewer Snow Leopard astutely observes ) is notable ONLY for that reason : this low-budget short just isn't funny . Some vaguely Latin American music is performed , but this too is negligible . Arguably , it's also notable that this film was produced by Al Christie . In silent-film days , Christie was the poor man's Mack Sennett ; he ground out cheapo comedy shorts and had a total disregard for his actors ' safety . ( At least one silent-film performer is known to have died of injuries caused by working in a Christie movie ; I wouldn't be surprised if there were more . ) Bob Hope , eager to break into films , signed a multi-picture contract with Christie but ( for reasons which I'll reveal ) this was the only film they made together . A minor footnote worth mentioning is that Hope filmed this movie at Paramount's studio in Astoria , NY ; the one mentioned in ' King Kong ' , and the same place where the Marx Brothers and W . C . Fields made some of their early films . The film's title would more accurately be ' Going South American ' . Our Bob , playing his usual brash character , passes through the South American village of Los Pochos ( ' poachos ' ) Eggos . That name is the best gag in the picture . The Pochos Eggosians have a quaint tradition : namely , that - - on one day each year - - any crime is forgiven provided that the malefactor sings a song afterward . ( This premise doesn't bear examination . ) Of course , Bob just happens to show up on the appropriate day . Now , here's a funnier joke than anything in this movie , and it's also a true story . Just after ' Going Spanish ' was released , Bob Hope ran into a nightclub columnist in Manhattan . Hope was eager to get his name into the columnist's newspaper , and he knew he'd have a better chance of this if he gave the columnist something funny to print . The bank robber John Dillinger was in the headlines at the time , still at large . So , Hope told the columnist that he was starring in ' Going Spanish ' , then added : ' When they catch Dillinger , they're going to make him sit through it twice . ' That joke duly made it into the newspaper column . . . where Al Christie read it . He angrily terminated Hope's contract . This turned out to be good for Hope , who promptly signed with Warners and made some much funnier comedy shorts at their Vitaphone studio in Brooklyn . It's faintly ironic that Hope's eventual movie success was ultimately with Paramount , the studio which owned the facilities where he made ' Going Spanish ' . I'll give the unfunny ' Going Spanish ' precisely , for its historic significance . Nice try , Bob .
nearly a nasty Occident .	Sessue Hayakawa had a respectable career in silent-era Hollywood as an actor in films produced by white men for white audiences . But , as a Japanese man contending with the racial prejudices of the time , Hayakawa nearly always played villains . . . usually wily Orientals who lusted after decent white women . Because Hayakawa was working in Hollywood with white actors , most of his silent films were slight variations on the same plot : Hayakawa as an outsider in the white man's world , caught in the clash of incompatible cultures . ' The First Born ' , intriguingly , takes place in China and all the characters are Chinese . Unfortunately , nearly all the actors in this film are Caucasians , and their makeup jobs as Orientals are . . . well , let's say that Lon Chaney's talents are sorely lacking hereabouts . You've never seen so many unconvincing eyebrows and dodgy eyelids in one place . Particularly disastrous is the make-up job on Clarence Wilson , an extremely prolific character actor whose distinctive bald head ( resembling a peeled garlic clove ) is instantly recognisable despite the Sellotape on his eyelids . Another actor ( a genuine Oriental , this one ) plays a character identified in the intertitles as ' Man Low Tek ' . . . which suggests some very unfortunate low-tech puns . The differences between the facial structures of the genuine Orientals and the fake Orientals in this cast are glaringly obvious . The plot ? Cue Mister Wu . A boy named Chan Toy is killed , and his mother Chan Lee is sold into slavery . A tong war breaks out , with a murder committed to avenge the death of Chan Toy , and then another murder committed ( in the opposite direction ) to avenge the revenge . You want an abacus to count the corpses . An Occidental onlooker might count it as a point in this film's favour that , for once , Hayakawa is able to star in a film with an Oriental setting . Hold the rice balls . Hayakawa was Japanese , and the characters in this film are Chinese . Those are two entirely different cultures , and the Japanese are not noted for their deep admiration of the Chinese . I've lived in Kowloon and visited mainland China , and I know a wee bit about the Chinese culture : I found the depictions in this movie inaccurate to the point of giving offence . This movie would have us believe that all Chinese are bloodthirsty buddhists , so deeply obsessed with tradition , saving face , and fealty to one's ancestors that they cannot act as self-willed individuals . As Hayakawa produced this film , he must ultimately take the blame for what a white screenwriter and director have perpetrated here . The fact that this film about Orientals was made by an Oriental does not change the fact that ' The First Born ' is deeply racist . I'll rate this movie precisely one point , for the expert camera work and for some ' Chinese ' sets that fail to convince me of their authenticity but which are impressive for sheer effort .
Little Tich did it better , way back in 1900 .	When talking pictures came in , a lot of vaudeville performers were able to preserve their acts on film . . . notably in the Vitaphone shorts filmed in Brooklyn ( NY ) , which typically ran for ten minutes . Unfortunately , some vaudeville acts didn't deserve ten minutes on their tod , so several of them would be lumped together in a compilation film . ' Nine O'Clock Folks ' is one such godawfulness , which has so little talent on offer that it even manages to bung in a vague attempt at a plot line . We're in some hick village in the Ozarks where the folks need a new steeple , so they put on a show to raise the money . The best turn on the bill here is Wilbur Hall , unbilled in the credits but playing some guy named ' Bert ' . He does his eccentric dance on a pair of plank shoes , which he performed previously ( and better ) in ' King of Jazz ' and would later repeat on Spike Jones's TV show . For an even better and funnier dance on similar shoes , look for the film ' Little Tich and His Big Boots ' which was made way back in 1900 but has recently been spotted on YouTube . Three young ladies billed as Faith , Hope and Charity are quite pretty ( well , two of them are ) but insist on performing a song in that horrible twangy harmony which renders so many country-western songs unbearable for me . We also get an act cried the Toonerville Trio . . . all four of them , and that's the most entertaining part of their act . They perform ' Saint Louis Blues ' on some sort of skiffle instruments . A previous IMDb reviewer has called them the ' legendary ' Mound City Blue Blowers , but I don't see ( or hear ) what's so ' legendary ' about them . There seems to be some rule about blues musicians : the more obscure and unimportant any bluesman was , the more important some writer will make him out to be . The closing turn , with a dog dressed in human clothes , is genuinely painful to watch : not because it's allegedly cruel to the dog , but because it's just so stupid and unfunny . It's made even worse because this act is ostensibly being performed for all those hillbillies in the room , but it's staged in a manner so that it would be impossible for most of them to see . Which makes them luckier than me , sitting through this rubbish . My rating for " Nine O'Clock Folks " : one . If I have to spend ten minutes with hillbillies , I'd rather be with Daisy Mae and a jug of moonshine .
Comes the revolution , comrade . . .	In the mid-1930s , Paramount Pictures sponsored an early experiment in auteurism when Adolph Zukor permitted Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur to write , direct and produce several films at Paramount's east coast studio in Astoria , New York . I'm a front-row fan of Hecht and MacArthur , but their scripts need the discipline of a tight-fisted producer and an experienced director . ( The Hecht-MacArthur stage play ' The Front Page ' is justifiably a classic . . . but it owes much of its success to George S Kaufman , who directed the original Broadway production and supervised the final version of the script . ) Of all the Hecht-MacArthur ' auteur ' films , their best is probably ' Crime Without Passion ' ( for its bravura opening sequence and its twist ending ) , while their worst is definitely ' Once in a Blue Moon ' . ' Soak the Rich ' falls just below midway between these two points . This film has glimmerings of interest , but overall I must consider it a failed opportunity . Walter Connolly plays Humphrey Craig , an apoplectic tycoon who has endowed a university . His idealistic daughter Belinda enrols there , hoping to get some idea of the ' real world ' ( good luck ) . When Professor Popper lectures his students on the merits of a ' soak-the-rich ' tax bill , Craig ( who opposes the bill ) gets Popper fired . Meanwhile , Joe Muglia is the leader of a band of radicals on campus . When the radicals protest the dismissal of Popper , Belinda falls in love with Buzz Jones , a radical who is also a clear-eyed , handsome idealist ( aren't they all ? ) . This movie stinks . It wants credit for being politically aware , but it can't sort out its own politics . The dialogue defends radical protest , but it also indicates that young radicals are radical because their hormones are acting up , as opposed to any political agenda . ' Soak the Rich ' is clearly meant to be a ' serious ' comedy , but it isn't funny enough to be a comedy . . . and not deep enough to be serious . Here's the one good line in the movie : " I'm a firm believer in democracy , provided it lets me alone . " Walter Connolly has never impressed me , in any of his roles . His voice is too high-pitched , his manner indecisive . Watch Edward Arnold in the title role of ' Meet Nero Wolfe ' , and then compare his performance to Walter Connolly attempting the same role in the sequel , ' The League of Frightened Men ' : Arnold is brilliant , while Connolly is awful . As the head radical in ' Soak the Rich ' , Lionel Stander is brilliant and hilarious , as always . In real life , Stander was eventually blacklisted for alleged communist sympathies : I wonder if his role in this film was a factor in that event . John Howard ( no relation to Australia's former prime minister ) is dull and insipid as the juvenile lead , but so handsome he nearly makes up for his lack of talent . ( Ben Hecht later chose Howard to play the male lead - - the Fredric March role - - in the Broadway musical ' Hazel Flagg ' , based on Hecht's ' Nothing Sacred ' . ) When I interviewed John Howard shortly before his death , he described the bizarre method that Hecht and MacArthur employed for co-directing this movie : they took it in turns , with Hecht directing for two days while MacArthur heckled him from the sidelines . . . then they switched places , with MacArthur directing while Hecht heckled MacArthur . Ilka Chase is wonderfully acerbic here in a small role . In a supporting role , Alice Miller shows no dramatic talent but does display the interesting facial bone structure she inherited from her mother , the novelist Alice Duer Miller . In a small role here is John Call : years later and several stone heavier , he played Santa Claus in ' Santa Claus Conquers the Martians ' . . . which is arguably a better movie than ' Soak the Rich ' . I'll rate this movie .
Harry Gribbon ties a ribbon on a greasy grimy gibbon	Ralph Spence wrote his play ' The Gorilla ' in the mid-1920s , when Broadway audiences had already seen several dead-earnest thriller plays about spooky old houses full of trapdoors and masked villains . The posters for the 1925 Broadway production of ' The Gorilla ' acknowledged its predecessors , by ballyhooing : ' Out-bats " The Bat " ! Out-cats " The Cat and the Canary " ! Out-warns " The Last Warning " ! ' What made ' The Gorilla ' a hit onstage was the fact that it spoofed the cliches of spooky-house plays while managing to be somewhat scary on its own merits , much as ' Arsenic and Old Lace ' would be a few years later . The various film versions of ' The Gorilla ' downplay the thriller elements , replacing them with lowbrow slapstick comedy . . . thus rendering a wildly improbable storyline even more implausible . The 1927 silent-film version deviates considerably from Spence's play . This 1930 remake ( the first talkie version ) is very slightly more faithful to Spence's stage production , and is so different from the 1927 silent that I have difficulty considering this a true remake . The 1927 version managed to combine thrills and slapstick very skilfully . This 1930 version also tries to be a comedy thriller . . . but unfortunately it isn't very successful at either of those goals . Mean old miser Cyrus Stevens ( the fine actor Edwin Maxwell ) is murdered in his creepy old house . Alice Denby is his ward , played by Lila Lee in a limp performance . Along come a couple of dumb Irish police detectives . The head cop ( Garrity ) is played by Joe Frisco , a legendary vaudeville comedian who made very few movies . Joe Frisco was a unique Broadway character : the stories told about him are much funnier than anything he did onscreen , including in this movie . His assistant ( Mulligan ) is played by Harry Gribbon , an actor with some very impressive film credits who never impressed me in any film in which I've ever seen him . He's not funny here . Time to send in the gorillas . The clues indicate that maybe the murderer is a gorilla , who has wandered into the Stevens mansion . ( Probably to get out of the rain . ) For some reason , Garrity decides that the best way to lure the gorilla out of hiding is to get himself dressed up in a gorilla suit . ( Sounds logical to me , but only if he dresses up in a FEMALE gorilla suit , and the MALE gorilla is very horny or very desperate . ) Dumb assistant Mulligan is just clever enough to wonder how he'll be able to tell the phony gorilla ( played by Joe Frisco in an ape suit ) from the real gorilla ( played by a stuntman in an ape suit ) . No problem : Garrity , ensconced in the gorilla cozzy , borrows a white hair ribbon from sweet Alice and ties it round his own neck . The gorilla with the ribbon is the phony . Got it ? Well , of course the real gorilla finds Garrity before Garrity finds HIM . And of course the real gorilla steals the ribbon and ties it round his own neck . And of course Mulligan and several other idiots in this movie see the gorilla with the ribbon and assume that he's Garrity . Mirthful mayhem is meant to ensue , but it doesn't ensue very much . Or at all . The fact that the ' real ' gorilla is played by a stuntman in a blatantly obvious ape-suit doesn't add to the fun . In one shot , I could see the buttons up the back of the ' real ' gorilla's body ! Also , during the sequences in which Joe Frisco's character Garrity is wearing a gorilla costume , it's obvious that the man inside the disguise is a stunt double who is much more athletic than Frisco . SEMI-SPOILER COMING . In the 1927 silent version of ' The Gorilla ' , Walter Pidgeon plays a handsome young man who is very helpful to sweet Alice , but in the last reel he turns out to be the dastardly villain . Walter Pidgeon is also on hand in this talkie remake , and once again he plays a handsome young man who is attentive to Alice . But this time , instead of being the surprise villain , he turns out to be ( surprise ! ) a detective . The unattractive actors Frisco and Gribbon play defective detectives ; Pidgeon is much better-looking than they are , so ( of course ) his detective is much more efficient and intelligent . Pidgeon usually impresses me ( he was an underrated actor ) , but here he's as stiff and lifeless as ( all together now ) a dead Pidgeon . Speaking of bad puns , I kept hoping somebody in this movie would say something like ' We'd better put a tail on that gorilla ' or ' If the gorilla is the murderer , the gorilla will swing ' . Those lines are awful , but they're funnier than any of the terrible dialogue in this movie . As with many early talkies ( especially the ones directed by Bryan Foy ) , the camerawork is almost nonexistent here , and the acting suffers for it : everyone in this movie ( except the gorilla ) seems to be concerned only with hitting their marks and speaking into the concealed microphones . The silent version of ' The Gorilla ' had much better camerawork , and was much funnier . I'll rate this remake . Skip this appalling ape-fest and watch the later remake with the Ritz Brothers .
Not remotely funny : never was , and never will be .	The wits of the Algonquin Round Table are my comedy gods , but Robert Benchley is the false idol in the pantheon . I've never found Benchley funny , and never understood why so many other people do so . His jokes are painfully obvious to me : in ' How to Be a Detective ' , when Benchley escorts a criminal to the penitentiary , we can tell from a mile away which one of them is going to walk out the gate whistling , and which one is going to end up in a cell . It was Benchley , not Groucho Marx , who said the line about getting out of some wet clothes and into a dry martini . . . but the line was written by Charles Brackett as dialogue for Benchley in one of his movie roles , so I shan't give Benchley credit for it . " The Treasurer's Report " has a history more interesting than the film itself . In 1922 , a Russian revue with the French title ' Chauve-Souris ' appeared on Broadway . The show was so arty-tarty that the Algonquin wits responded with a one-night-only revue of their own , titled ' No Siree ' ( a pun on ' Chauve-Souris ' ) . Benchley's sole contribution to the evening's entertainment was a monologue in which he played the assistant treasurer of a social club , required on short notice to give a financial report and failing badly . According to legend , Benchley wrote the skit at the last moment , during a cab ride to the 49th Street Theatre . It certainly feels like it . This short film is a re-enactment of that skit , fleshed out slightly by letting Benchley interact with other people . It's not remotely funny . Benchley , cast as the assistant treasurer , explains that the head treasurer is home with a cold . When a clubman corrects him , Benchley responds : " I guess the joke's on me . . . he has pneumonia . " Then Benchley plays with his tie until it comes undone . Let me know when it's time to laugh , please . In private life , Benchley never considered himself a comedian ( I'll second that motion ) , claiming that his real ambition was to write a serious biography of Queen Anne . But he never wrote it . I wish he'd never written this movie , either . I'll rate this pathetic short film , purely for its historic significance as a very early talkie . And now here's the one and only funny thing that Robert Benchley ever said . One of his MGM short subjects required Benchley to be stranded on some overhead telephone lines . His wife happened to be present on the set while stagehands used a cherry-picker to lift Benchley and put him in the wires . While the camera was setting up the shot , Benchley looked down at his wife and asked her : " Do you remember how good I was at Latin in college ? " When she replied in the affirmative , Benchley told her : " Well , look where it got me . "
A lass and a lack of a good script	For some reason , many silent films with contemporary settings had flashbacks to ancient times . The most obvious example of this is Cecil B . DeMille's ' Male and Female ' , with its flashback to Babylon . . . and , indeed , several of DeMille's movies from the Jazz Age found convenient excuses for sending the main characters back to ancient times ( via flashback ) on some flimsy pretext . ' Alas and Alack ' is a very low-budget film which follows this same structure , interrupting the main story with a barely relevant fantasy sequence set in some fairy-tale mediaeval kingdom . Lon Chaney plays two roles in this film ; his two make-ups here are rather less convincing than usual , but one of his two characters is a fantasy grotesque , so the make-up for this role doesn't need to be plausible . The lead role here is Jess , a poor fishwife somewhere on the Pacific coast , well-played by Cleo Madison . Chaney plays her ( nameless ) husband , a fisherman who is the equivalent of Tevye the milkman : he gets very little work done because he's busy fantasising about what he would do with his wealth IF he were a rich man ( biddy-biddy-boom ) . . . SYNOPSIS WITH SPOILER : One day , Jess meets a yachtsman who IS rich : Charles Holcombe , who is wealthy but unhappily married to a wife who nags him constantly yet who otherwise ignores him . Jess and Holcombe are attracted to each other , but . . . well , the marriage bonds are sacred . They linger on the edge of some sort of romance , but it doesn't happen . He goes back to his spouse ( a fishwife in the figurative sense ) , whilst Jess ( a fishwife in the literal sense ) goes back to mending fishnets for her husband . Something wonderful almost might have happened , but . . . This turgid plotline is interrupted while Jess tells her daughter a fairy tale about a beautiful princess who is magically imprisoned in a seashell ; to this day , if you put a seashell to your ear , you can hear the princess moaning . The characters in this fairy tale are played by the actors in the main story , as dual roles : Jess becomes the princess , Holcombe becomes a handsome prince , while Chaney shows up as a grim mediaeval hunchback : a practice-run for Quasimodo , perchance ? The events in the fairy tale are meant to parallel the events in the main story , or meant to point to some moral , or something . What really happens is that the main story , such as it is , screeches to a halt so that we can see this twee muck about the wee princess in the seashell , and then just when we're beginning to lose CONCH-usness ( pardon the pun , it's very shellfish of me ) , we pick up the dull thread where it left off . This is one of those stories where people are ABOUT to make tremendous changes in their unfortunate lives , but never quite work up the nerve . Well , why should we care ? Chaney's make-ups are interesting , and Cleo Madison gives two decent performances as the princess ( who can't quite come out of her shell ) and the fishwife ( ditto ) . I'll rate this movie .
He's reckless but he won't be wreckless .	There is one action-movie genre which I absolutely despise : the one in which motorists drive irresponsibly and recklessly , at maximum speed with minimum brains , and the audience are expected to cheer them on . In real life , plenty of innocent people have been killed because some idiot with too much testosterone and not enough brain cells got behind a steering wheel . The last thing we need is movies which glorify this behaviour . I collectively call such films ' Scumball Rally ' movies . Having encountered too many movies like this in the 1980s and ' 90s , I was mortified to discover that the genre was already firmly in place in silent films . " The Drivin ' Fool " is one example . Henry Locke is a businessman in San Francisco , who has signed a contract requiring that he deliver a cheque for a large sum to a Wall Street broker by noontime a few days hence . If the cheque is not there to schedule , Locke will lose his business to his rival Howard Grayson . Locke thought he had sufficient time to post the cheque , but one of his assistants ( Richard Browley ) is secretly in Grayson's employ , and delays posting the cheque . Conveniently , there's a nationwide rail stoppage , so the cheque can't be couriered by train . This is the cue for Locke's son Hal to grab the cheque and zoom off cross-country in his racing car , gleefully ignoring petty details like speed limits and stoplights . I find this sort of storytelling hugely irresponsible . We're meant to admire Hal because he's trying to save his father's business , but it's obvious that the character is aroused by speeding ( the movie's titles identify him as ' speed-mad ' ) , and it's also obvious that the people who made this film expect the audience to admire Hal for his speedy habits . As if this weren't bad enough , the movie is also racist . Early in his cross-country motor trip , Hal acquires a Negro sidekick who rejoices in the name Horatio Jackson Lee , whom Hal promptly dubs ' Cupid ' . Horatio - - played by a black man named Jesse Aldrich , who is clearly no actor - - indulges in plenty of ' yassuh ' dialogue ( supplied by the title cards ) , and some racial humour based on stereotypes of black people as cowardly or stupid . The actress Patsy Ruth Miller never greatly appealed to me . She was pretty and had some talent , but neither her looks nor her acting abilities were above the usual . She made precisely one major film - - ' The Hunchback of Notre Dame ' - - but that film's successes owe very little to her performance . However , I met Ms Miller at Film Forum in NYC on the night of a screening of ' So This Is Paris ' , one of her movies . She generously consented to an interview , and spoke warmly to me of many people with whom she worked in silent-era Hollywood . My fond memories of that evening have prompted me to seek out as many of Patsy Ruth Miller's films as possible : regrettably , few of them seem to be very good . In " The Drivin ' Fool " , Patsy Ruth Miller plays the feminine love interest , but most of her scenes are at the beginning and the end of the film . After the contrived set-up to explain why the cheque can't be sent by post or by rail , the bulk of the movie is occupied with Wally Van's reckless driving and Jesse Aldrich's minstrel-show behaviour . The film's direction is weak , with some poor shot-matching . Sadly , I rate this movie only 2 points in 10 , and I'm being generous .
Was the German version better ? It could hardly be worse !	' Der Greifer ' - literally ' The Snatcher ' - was shot concurrently in German - and English-language versions ; this was a fairly common practice in the early days of talking pictures , when it was not yet practical to overdub dialogue soundtracks . Inevitably there are other differences between the different versions : in this case , the heroine Dolly Mooreland was played by Charlotte Susa in the German version and by Muriel Angelus in the English version . This posting is a review of ' Night Birds ' , the English version . As I've not seen the German version , I can't offer a precise comparison between them . I've seen a script for the German version , in which some of the characters ' names differ from the English version , but I haven't read it deeply enough to attempt a comparison . Right . There are these three gangsters . One of them is named Scotty , and so far the film is plausible . From this point onwards , it isn't . The other two gangsters are named Dancer Johnny and Toothpick Jeff . In English , these nicknames are more than slightly incredible . It's possible that these are translations of German nicknames which ( for all I know ) may indeed be quite plausible . These three crooks take their marching orders from a mysterious gang leader who likes to keep his identity a secret . ( And I don't blame him . ) We get the impression early on that one of the other people in this movie - someone seemingly honest - is the gang leader , and there's going to be some sort of unmasking at the climax of the film . The crooks are planning a jewel robbery . Two cops are trying to catch the crooks . But instead of working together , the cops are rivals working at cross purposes . In a variation of the good cop-bad cop scenario , one cop is determined to follow the rules and nab the crooks in a high-minded manner . The other cop is utterly ruthless , determined to nick them by any means fair or foul . We're meant to recognise that this cop is worse than the gangsters . Could have fooled me . There are two different photographers credited : apparently Bruno Mondi shot the German version whilst Heinrich Gärtner filmed the English version . As the two versions must have been made concurrently rather than simultaneously , I can't possibly see why two different cameramen were needed unless they were working in rotating shifts on a tight schedule . ( This was sometimes the case in Hollywood during the early talkies period . ) Gärtner did a lousy job , because the photography in the English version is too dark and out of focus . The direction is bad too , with terrible pacing and with almost every shot poorly framed . This film seems to have been made without a viewfinder . The sound recording is wretched , although that was a common problem in 1930 . The editing and shot matching are quite bad . All the actors give bad performances ; Jameson Thomas as a villain is especially embarrassing . Most annoying of all , the plot is filled with howlingly implausible situations . The director appears to be attempting some damage control : this movie is primarily a caper story in the Edgar Wallace mould , but all through the film are half-hearted efforts at comedy relief , as if the director is trying to convince us that none of this is meant seriously . The principal author of this mess is Max Ehrlich , who later wrote the incredibly bad novel ' The Reincarnation of Peter Proud ' . ( The name Peter Proud all by itself is bad enough to ruin any plotline . ) Ehrlich also wrote one of the worst episodes of the original ' Star Trek ' series . I'm usually sympathetic to part-talkies and early talkies , as they had to overcome so many tech problems . . . but ' Night Birds ' is far worse than it needs to be . The German-language versions of ' The Blue Angel ' and Garbo's ' Anna Christie ' are vastly superior to the English-langage versions . As most of the people involved in making ' Night Birds ' were German , it's quite possible that the German-language version of ' Der Greifer ' is superior to this English-language version . Based solely on a viewing of the English version and a glance at the German screenplay , I'll rate this mess .
Nothing very ' Champion ' here	Marge and Gower Champion were a popular dance team in the 1950s , probably best-known for ' Show Boat ' , in which their roles were very much secondary . They did some of their best work in television , notably in a musical special with Yves Montand . Although they were excellent dancers , and Gower was a very talented director / choreographer with some ability as a comedian , neither one of them had much acting ability . . . which seriously compromised them when MGM attempted to move them up from supporting roles in other people's musicals . ' Everything I Have Is Yours ' was MGM's attempt at a starring vehicle for the Champions . Frankly , they aren't good enough actors to carry the weight of a feature film , even a musical . The Champions play Pamela and Chuck Hubbard , a husband-and-wife dance team . ( What a stretch ! ) The Hubbards have attained stardom together , but there are backstage problems in the marriage , and they agree to a trial separation . Pamela becomes involved with another man ( Dennis O'Keefe in a bland performance ) , and for a while it looks like the Hubbards will go their separate ways permanently . But this is an MGM musical , so of course there's a happy ending . . . ' Everything I Have Is Yours ' is froth . . . which wouldn't be bad at all , if it were enjoyable froth . This movie is turgid . Imagine a musical version of a soap opera , and that's what you've got here . Worse luck , the musical numbers aren't incorporated into the plot of the movie . . . instead , the plot screeches to a halt ( and I do mean ' screeches ' ) whenever it's time for another dance number . When the music stops , the plot lurches forward again . This is a bad movie . I'll rate it . As a trivia note , I'll mention that Marge Champion ( real name Marjorie Belcher ; I wonder why she changed it ) was the half-sister of silent-film star Lina Basquette , who was so good in Cecil B . DeMille's ' The Godless Girl ' . I recommend you see that movie instead of this one .
Not so much a circus as a freak show .	Arthur Lucan and Kitty McShane starred in a series of low-budget comedies that were extremely popular in 1940s Britain , in which Lucan ( in drag ) played an old Irish scrubwoman named Mrs Riley , and McShane ( Lucan's real-life wife ) played Old Mother Riley's daughter Kitty . Neither of these portrayals were very plausible : Lucan's ' Irish ' accent was just as obviously fake as his allegedly female gender . The running conceit of McShane's character is that Kitty is supposed to be extremely gorgeous . ( She was mildly pretty in the earlier films , but less so later . . . especially when the camera catches her in profile so we can see her nose in all its glory . ) ' Old Mother Riley's Circus ' isn't very funny ( neither are any of the others in the series ) , but this feature benefits from a higher budget than most of the others , and by a rousing tap-dance number by a shapely brunette who is unmentioned in the credits . There are some impressive ( and expensive ) burst wipes during the opening credits . This time , Old Mother Riley is given a backstory that renders Lucan's character even more implausible than usual . Years ago , Old Mother Riley was the young and beautiful Maggie O'Hara , a star in the variety halls until her no-good husband George left her and took their infant daughter Kitty . The elderly Lucan is utterly implausible as an old woman . To assert that ' she ' used to be a beautiful young actress is a notion that's too grotesque to be funny . When Old Mother Riley mentions that she performed in tights , the mental image is not a pleasant one . When Old Mother Riley is offered a job in a cinema , and she covets one of the scanty uniforms worn by the pretty usherettes , this is apparently meant to seem like the wistful desire of an old woman to relive her young days as a beauty . As Lucan performs the scene , he comes off like an old drag queen drooling over a new frock . Intriguingly , although male actor Lucan is playing a biological female in all the Mother Riley films , they usually contained at least one reference to Lucan's true gender . In ' Circus ' , this comes when an actor says scornfully of Mother Riley : ' Anyone can see SHE's no lady ! ' Speaking of cross-gender casting , there's a very bizarre scene between Old Mother Riley and a young clerk at the labour exchange . The clerk is played by an attractive young actress . . . but she's dressed as a young man , has short-cropped hair , and she speaks her lines in what appears to be an intentionally deepened voice . I honestly can't tell if this character is meant to be a young man ( played by a woman ) or an androgynous girl . The ambiguity serves no purpose except to make the whole movie seem weirder . Kitty McShane is prettier than usual here in her circus cozzy , an Annie Oakley get-up with a short skirt and gauntlets . This film varies the usual formula of Lucan's and McShane's on screen relationship . Kitty is still playing Old Mother Riley's daughter , but this time they've been separated since Kitty's infancy , and are reunited only by chance in the dodgy circus where Kitty is working as the target of a drunken knife-thrower . Implausibly , after mother and adult daughter meet for the first time , they very soon behave as if they've known each other all of Kitty's life . More impressively , Lucan does a scene in which Old Mother Riley disguises herself as a counterfeit countess . To his credit , in this sequence Lucan actually seems to be playing a completely different female impersonation from his Mother Riley turn . All of the Mother Riley films are top-heavy with puns , but ' Circus ' ( more so than most ) features British references that American viewers won't comprehend . There's a pun on the word ' stalls ' in the British sense of a theatre's orchestra seats . Lucan does a monologue about the maharajah who married a sultana , and she's his ' current wife ' . ( In England , ' sultana ' - - the word for a sultan's wife - - also means a raisin or a dried currant . ) Lucan also comments : ' All's fair in love and Wardour Street ' . . . this being the London street where most of Britain's wartime film studios had their business offices . There's also a gag about ' Dan , Dan , the lavender man ' . . . this is a cleaned-up version of a smutty joke that used to be popular among English schoolboys . Substitute ' lavatory ' for ' lavender ' and you'll get a hint . SLIGHT SPOILER . For most of its length , ' Old Mother Riley's Circus ' manages to be mildly amusing . There is ( no surprise ) a happy ending . But then comes the very last shot in the film . This is a grotesque shot of female impersonator Lucan in extreme close-up . Leering directly into the camera , he tells us in his falsetto brogue : ' Bye-bye . God bless you . See you again soon . ' And then ' she ' makes a little moué kiss at us ! No thanks ! I'll rate this movie , mostly for that uncredited brunette girl who does a sexy tap-dance .
Defective detective , no noir	The chief appeal of ' Mister Dynamite ' is that it's based on a story by Dashiell Hammett , whose detective stories tended to be realistic because Hammett drew upon his own experiences as a private eye for the Pinkerton agency . So , that's one point in this movie's favour . Another good point is that ' Mister Dynamite ' takes place in San Francisco , a city that Hammett knew well and which he evoked very compellingly in much of his fiction . . . most notably in ' The Maltese Falcon ' . Unfortunately , this low-budget movie doesn't come nearly to the level of that great novel nor the John Huston movie it inspired . This movie isn't even as good as Hammett's detective yarns about the Continental Op . It's all by-the-numbers . If there's a dead body or some fisticuffs every fifteen minutes , the audience aren't expected to mind that the story isn't very plausible . Edmund Lowe ( whose career was by now in the downhill phase ) plays San Francisco ' tec T . N . Thompson , nicknamed ' Mr Dynamite ' . He's meant to be the hero of this thick-ear , but he's totally immoral . Private eye Thompson has a bitter rivalry with the police , to the point where he steals evidence from crime scenes so the police can't solve the crimes ahead of him . He also buys luxury items for his girlfriend , billing these to his clients as expenses . We're supposed to like this guy . So far we've got two different clichés here , neither of them very plausible . I can understand why a private detective might dislike the police , but I get annoyed at how often fictional private eyes make a point of baiting and antagonising the police force . ( This was also done in ' Chinatown ' , a film which I found hugely implausible and vastly overrated . ) Private detectives are licensed by the police and are required to cooperate with local police . In real life , if a private eye got one-tenth as sarcastic to a police officer as Jake Gittes and T . N . Thompson do in these implausible movies , his livelihood would get yanked out from under him toot-sweet . As for the second cliché : I find it even less plausible that T . N . Thompson has got a steady supply of clients who are rich enough and stupid enough for him to be able to mulct them so thoroughly with none of them ever tipping wise . But , that's just me . Anyway , a gambler gets bumped off , and Thompson vows to crack the case ahead of the flatfoots . ( Flatfeet ? ) Then a concert pianist gets plugged in his crescendo . The latter is played by Victor Varconi , hissable as usual . Most of the dialogue in this bad B-movie sounds like bad B-movie dialogue , but it never quite reaches the level of enjoyable cheesiness that really ' good ' bad B-movie dialogue possesses . Matt McHugh provides a few pleasant moments as a Brooklyn wiseacre . Nenette Lafayette , who spent her entire film career playing French maids , shows up here as ( wait for it ) a French maid . Jean Dixon gets in a few good lines as Thompson's wisecracking assistant . Dixon had an impressive career on Broadway , playing world-weary dames , yet she never quite caught on in movies . . . possibly because several other actresses ( Glenda Farrell , Marjorie Rambeau ) were already established in similar roles . What I really dislike about ' Mister Dynamite ' is that it reminds me of twenty other ( better ) movies , without ever reminding me of why I liked those movies . ' Mister Dynamite ' seems to have been assembled from the out-takes of several other private-eye flicks . . . and there's no noir to be seen . There's not much bang in ' Mr Dynamite ' , and I'll rate this movie .
in-Fernald devices	' The Marvellous Inventions of Alvin Fernald ' , by Clifford B . Hicks , is a really brilliant children's novel about a boy named Alvin who wants to be a scientist AND a detective . . . so he devises all sorts of low-tech ( but complicated ) inventions , which he then uses in his inept attempts to solve mysteries and crimes . He is assisted ( if that's the right word ) by his pal Wilfred Shoemaker , nicknamed Shoey ( an athlete and acrobat ) , and by Alvin's tomboy younger sister Daphne , also known as ' the Pest ' . One of the virtues of Hicks's wonderful novel is that , although it's told from a boy's viewpoint , he avoids the obvious " girls are icky " stereotype . At several points in the book , Daphne is smarter or more resourceful than her brother . ' The Whiz Kid and the Mystery at Riverton ' is a very poor adaptation of Hicks's very fine novel . One of young Alvin's friends is his neighbour Miss Pinkney , the spinster recluse whose great pleasure is feeding the birds in her garden . But Miss Pinkney hasn't fed the birds lately : in fact , Alvin hasn't seen her recently at all . And who are those mean-looking men who have moved into Miss Pinkney's house ? Naturally , Alvin and his cohorts decide to investigate . But this case calls for some of Alvin's crime-solving gizmos . . . The original novel was suspenseful and funny ( with Alvin and his buddies genuinely in danger from the villains ) , and it encouraged young readers to cultivate some genuine interest in science . This TV adaptation is a tremendous letdown . The spooky-house plot has the feel of a Scooby-Doo episode without the supernatural trimmings . This TV movie places too much emphasis on slapstick at the expense of the other story elements . Most of the cast provide limp performances , and the three child actors in the lead roles are disastrous . Veteran character actors John Fiedler , Edward Andrews and George O'Hanlon are ingratiating in brief roles . Rae Dawn Chong is quite attractive here , and she gives a good performance . The direction , by somebody I've never heard of , is truly wretched . This being a Disney TV movie , the production values and musical scoring are ( as usual for Disney ) excellent . Clifford B . Hicks's original novel about Alvin Fernald and his sister and Shoey produced a couple of sequel novels which were very good in themselves . This TV movie also led to a couple of sequels , but they went steadily downhill . I'll rate this TV production . Try to locate the original Clifford B . Hicks novels , and give them to your kids instead of this TV movie .
Oh , Henry !	I'm a fan of Bert Lahr , and I'm also an advocate for the talents of director Ray McCarey ( the unjustly obscure brother of Leo McCarey ) . So , when I learnt that Bert Lahr played Henry the Eighth in a film directed by Ray McCarey , I was salivating to see it . Lackaday , the movie just ain't very funny . For some reason , the movie breezes past Henry's first three wives , then divides its screen time between Anne of Cleves ( Janet Reade ) and Catherine Howard ( Leni Stengel ) , the latter caught up in her adulterous affair with Thomas Culpeper . That gentleman is played here by Monte Collins , a scrawny actor who looks even less appetising than Bert Lahr , so it's difficult to see why Lahr would be cuckolded here . As Henry Tudor , Lahr makes an attempt to personate the famous Holbein portrait of the king , wearing a beard that looks distressingly scruffy rather than funny . Basically , Lahr does his usual schtick here , but it's less effective than usual against a 16th-century background . We get some dialogue such as " Thou hadst better scram . " Lahr name-drops William Shakespeare , but he's a couple of decades too early . I laughed at a line about " Sir Walter Winchell " , but much of the ( very weak ) comedy here is merely anachronism , with Lahr seeking a 16th-century divorce in Reno and listening to an Atwater-Kent cathedral radio . I was delighted to see Shemp Howard listed in this film's opening credits . Unfortunately , that most under-rated of Stooges appears only very briefly in a role that could have been played by anyone . More pleasantly , we see some chorus girls cavorting in principal-boy doublets and hose . . . historically inaccurate , but I'm not complaining . There's no mention at all of Henry VIII's sixth wife , so I guess this film is below Parr . I'll rate this dismal disappointment only . Or , as Bert Lahr would have put it : " Ong , ong , ong ! "
Lacklustre direction , insipid script	Actor-director Rupert Julian is now remembered solely as the man credited with directing ' The Phantom of the Opera ' ( 1925 ) , a screen classic . But credits can be deceiving . Julian and the film's star Lon Chaney quarrelled intensely during production , to the point where Julian was removed from the set and three other directors ( including Chaney himself ) completed the shooting schedule . Very little of the completed ' Phantom ' was directed by Rupert Julian . A screening of any other available film directed by Julian reveals him to be an uninteresting and indecisive director . " Hell's Highroad " boasts a large production budget , with costumes and sets very nearly the equal of those in ' Phantom of the Opera ' . . . yet the result is a lacklustre film , with a cast of experienced actors who seem uncertain of what to do next . Even the climactic struggle , with Edmund Burns on the brink of strangling Leatrice Joy , is stodgily staged and unimaginatively photographed . As for that overwrought and deceptive title , " Hell's Highroad " : if you're looking for a movie about Hell , or the Devil , or satanism . . . carry on looking elsewhere . Judy Nichols ( Leatrice Joy ) is determined to marry a millionaire : any millionaire will do , thanks . She's actually attracted to handsome young Ron ( Edmund Burns ) , and he returns the favour , but Ron has no money . Judy's friend Anne ( Julia Faye ) sets up Judy on a date with a financier . He's got the money , right enough , but Judy discovers she's not attracted to him . However , she asks him as a personal favour to use his financial expertise to make Ron rich . SPOILERS AHEAD . Hey presto ! No sooner does the projectionist change reels than Ron is suddenly a successful and wealthy stockbroker . ( Easy-peasy ! ) Unfortunately , he's now so interested in making money that he's no longer interested in Judy . Eventually she goads him into assaulting her . At this point the intertitles develop a throb in their throat as Judy tells the enraged Ron : " Go ahead - - choke me - - I love it . I'm glad you've got blood in your veins instead of gold . " Oh , blimey ! Throughout this movie , we're treated to elaborate set pieces featuring elegant gowns , posh furnishings , dinner services , and so forth . Too bad the story itself is so brainless . The actors do their best , yet seem to have no solid direction . The worst thing about this movie is its script , yet I'm certain that the exact same script would have made a better film if " Hell's Highroad " had been directed by Erich von Stroheim or Cecil B De Mille . . . or even his brother William de Mille . I'll rate this movie just barely , mostly because Leatrice Joy tries so hard .
Starts out amusing , but goes downhill .	Charles Ruggles was an extremely annoying comedian , rather like Clifton Webb without the bitchiness . Yet he was hugely popular in the 1930s . Ruggles tended to play henpecked little fusspots . One reason I find him annoying is that there are several movies - - ' Roadhouse Nights ' and ' Murder in the Zoo ' are good examples - - that could have been excellent if Ruggles wasn't in them : as they are , their scripts and direction have been radically twisted out of shape in order to make room for Ruggles's annoying comedy business . In ' If I Had a Million ' , I deeply resent that Ruggles and Mary Boland are given more screen time than WC Fields , Charles Laughton , Gary Cooper and other much more interesting performers . I find Mary Boland annoying too . She tended to play marcelled harridans , more like a drag queen than an actual woman . But I admire Boland's professionalism as an actress , whereas Ruggles is merely annoying . The two of them were often teamed on screen as a married couple , with Boland invariably bullying Ruggles . The team of Ruggles and Boland are even more annoying than either of them solo . ' People Will Talk ' at least varies the formula slightly , but only just . Ruggles and Boland are a well-to-do couple whose adult daughter Peggy ( vivacious Leila Hyams ) is about to celebrate the first anniversary of her marriage to Bill Trask ( Dean Jagger , doing an imitation of a block of wood ) . But Peggy quarrels with her husband because he was mildly attentive to a married woman . Boland decides to show her daughter how petty quarrelling is , so she urges meek husband Ruggles to stage a quarrel with her . He's reluctant until she bullies him into it . . . and then Ruggles quarrels with her so successfully that they have a genuine falling-out and their marriage is on the rocks . Liberated at last , the long-henpecked Ruggles gets into a drunken flirtation with married neighbour Doris . Then he ends up at a wrestling match , populated by knuckleheads with great movie names like Strangler , Spider and Prettyboy . This movie starts out slightly above average for the Ruggles-Boland teamings , largely because they have an adult child for once , and so the situations are different this time . Also , the worm ( Ruggles ) turns much earlier than usual for this formula . Unfortunately , this movie gets less funny with each successive reel . I'll rate ' People Will Talk ' only .
Speak , spook !	' The Ghost Talks ' isn't a horror movie : it's a comedy , but it isn't even a spooky old-house comedy , as there's no whiff of the supernatural . This movie became slightly weirder in hindsight , due to the presence of Stepin Fetchit . He gives his usual ' yassuh ' performance here , but this time round his character is named Christopher Lee . . . inevitably reminding modern viewers of the horror-film actor . The very bland blonde Helen Twelvetrees plays Miriam Holt , whose father embezzled a fortune in bearer bonds , then died . The fate of the bonds is unknown . Meanwhile , Miriam checks into an hotel for some peace and quiet . . . but this is a comedy , so you know there's no peace nor quiet to be had . Everybody is sneaking about , spying on everybody else . Let's see now : there's Carmel Myers as a Woman With A Secret . Arnold Lucy is the fastidious hotel manager , anticipating Franklin Pangborn . Clifford Dempsey is the gruff house detective . The best performance hereabouts is that of Mickey Bennett as a juvenile-delinquent bellhop . The direst performance is that of Charles Eaton ( Mary Eaton's brother ) as a wanna-be detective who - - get this , please - - actually dresses up as Sherlock Holmes , with a bent pipe and a deerstalker . Gor-blimey ! Like several other late-1920s films with vocal titles - - such as ' The Bat Whispers ' - - ' The Ghost Talks ' has a title intended to remind audiences that this movie is that new innovation , a talking picture , released at a time when many cinemas were still booking silents . I hope that sound engineer Joseph Aiken got paid overtime , because this movie features lots and lots and lots of ambient sound : street noises , huffapuffing railway engines , and so forth . Movie audiences in 1929 loved this novelty , but now it's a lot less charming . Even more bizarre is someone's decision to hamper several characters in this movie with speech impediments . Helen Twelvetrees utters her dialogue with a lisp . Asked if she always lisps , she replies ' No , only when I thpeak . ' ( Boom , boom ! ) Other characters stutter or stammer , or yammer their grammar . I'm astounded that this tactic would have been used at any time , but especially so for it to have been done in a very early talkie . Helen Twelvetrees somewhat resembles May McAvoy , a very beautiful blonde of the late silent era whose stardom was ruined when her first talking roles revealed her extreme and genuine lisp . Didn't the makers of ' The Ghost Talks ' realise that movie audiences might assume that Twelvetrees's feigned lisp was genuine . . . and that her career would be hurt accordingly ? Matters are not helped by the fact that Helen Twelvetrees gives a wooden performance . . . with only enough wood in it to make her , at best , Helen Fourtrees . I'm sympathetic to early talkies , with the technical problems they faced , so I'll rate this unfunny and unthrilling comedy-thriller . . . but I'm being generous .
Dated satire , vital viewing	Most people's knowledge of George M . Cohan begins and ends with " Yankee Doodle Dandy " , which features an embarrassing scene in which retired song-and-dance man Cohan ( played by James Cagney ) tells some jive-talking jitterbugs that he never appeared in any movies . This is simply not true , as Cagney himself knew well , because Cagney studied Cohan's performance in " The Phantom President " while rehearsing for " Yankee Doodle Dandy " . " Hit-the-Trail Holiday " is a seriously dated satire , on a subject which is no longer topical . But George M . Cohan is a vitally important performer , and his film appearances are so rare that any film in which he appeared is must-see viewing . ( Cohan's last film , " Gambling " , appears to be lost ; evidence indicates that all the prints were intentionally destroyed at Cohan's request . " The Phantom President " remains the best example of Cohan's performing talent . ) In the same way that Cohan's hit Broadway musical " Little Johnny Jones " was inspired by a real person ( the jockey Tod Sloan ) , " Hit-the-Trail Holiday " was inspired by the career of Billy Sunday . In the early twentieth century , Sunday ( his real name , apparently ) was a professional baseball player who spent most of his off-hours getting drunk . One day he supposedly had a religious conversion and became an evangelist , preaching the evils of alcohol and the joys of Christianity and total abstinence . Newsreel footage of Billy Sunday proves that he put on quite a show , leaping and shouting and howling at the devil and Demon Rum . In the years leading up to the First World War , Billy Sunday was a major figure in America's growing movement towards Prohibition . But Sunday was a controversial figure in his own time : he made a lot of money out of his religious " crusade " , and some observers cynically noted that Billy Sunday conveniently " found " religion at just the time when his baseball career was faltering , In " Hit-the-Trail Holiday " , George M . Cohan ( who somewhat resembled Billy Sunday ) plays a man named Billy Holiday ( hmmm . . . ) who is clearly a parody of Billy Sunday . Holiday is a bartender who never takes a drink because he believes that alcohol is evil , although he doesn't seem to mind making money off it . One day he decides to close down his bar and " hit the trail " , spreading the word about teetotalism . This film has one impressive scene in a subway station , and elsewhere there are some heavy - handed jokes at the expense of Germans . . . understandable for 1918 . " Hit-the-Trail Holiday " isn't very effective for modern audiences , as few people nowadays have even heard of Billy Sunday , and Prohibition isn't likely to win many 21st-century supporters . In a world of crack cocaine and Aids , it's hard to get worked up over a glass of beer . But any film containing George M . Cohan merits serious attention . I'll rate " Hit-the-Trail Holiday " for a rare glimpse of Cohan , one of the twentieth century's most important entertainment figures .
Defective detectives .	If Larry Semon had made more comedies like ' Her Boy Friend ' , his career might have lasted longer and ended more happily . Semon's typical screen character was a gormless menial labourer , a stumbling simpleton who came up trumps through dumb luck and accident . In ' Her Boy Friend ' , amazingly enough , Larry Semon plays a character more typical of silent-film comedian Raymond Griffith : he's well-dressed , cultured , and resourceful . At one point in this film , Semon punches a villain ; more usually , he played a coward who only found his courage in the climactic sequence if at all . Oliver Hardy , not yet teamed with Stan Laurel , did stalwart supporting work in many of Semon's films . Typically , Hardy played the foreman to Semon's dogsbody . . . or at any rate someone more respectable than Semon's drudge . In ' Her Boy Friend ' , Semon's well-dressed and sophisticated appearance is made even more remarkable by contrasting it with Hardy's appearance : cast as an escaped murderer , Hardy is unshaven and filthy here . Many of Semon's films are marred by unfunny and racist ' gag ' sequences featuring a cowardly black man . On this score , sadly , ' Her Boy Friend ' is all too typically a Semon movie . There's an unpleasant and unfunny sequence in which Hardy's villain bullies a black man . For once , Hardy plays his role in a Semon film almost dead-earnest ; it's a shame that Oliver Hardy didn't get more dramatic roles , as he could have been an excellent character actor . In this movie , as in several other Semon efforts , the black actor is Spencer Bell . Here , he does his usual scream-and-scarper routine , made slightly more unusual because he dives into water and swims away rather than running . Trust Larry Semon to take an unfunny gag and make it unfunnier ; this sequence is undercranked , so that Spencer Bell's cowardly Negro swims at superhuman speed . But , as even the lowliest film-maker knows ( or ought to know ) , undercranking should never be done in shots featuring open water , as the water will move too fast . The sequence is blatantly faked , and this obvious fakery removes every last vestige of humour . ' Her Boy Friend ' features more impressive sets and production design than usual for a Semon film , and Dorothy Dwan ( Semon's off-screen wife ) is more attractive than usual here as an undercover detective . Frank Alexander is cast as a character named ' Slim Chance ' : a bad joke , as Alexander is even bigger and fatter than Oliver Hardy . . . in fact , Alexander's mere presence in this film does much to undercut Hardy's effectiveness , since - - for once - - Hardy's not the biggest guy in the movie . I'll rate this weak effort just , which is also - - in spite of Semon's efforts to vary his formula here - - pretty much where Larry Semon's entire film career should rate .
Near-future war fantasia	' The Battle Cry of Peace ' is a weird film , depicting a near-future military invasion of the United States , and the subjugation of the American people . Surprisingly , another film on this same theme ( ' The Fall of a Nation ' ) was made only a few months later . This theme was considered very timely during the First World War . . . and it's timely once again , in the days following the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 . In ' Battle Cry ' , the invading legions are commanded by a mysterious dictator known only as ' Emanon ' ( or ' No Name ' spelt backwards ) . The American people , lulled into false security by homegrown pacifists , are caught unawares as foreign submarines breach the waters along the eastern seaboard . With surprising speed , America's cities are conquered and the people are enslaved by Emanon's occupying army . Several national figures appear as themselves in this film , including Admiral Dewey and ( the Army's Chief of Staff ) General Leonard Wood . It seems odd that American military leaders would play themselves in a fictional movie in which America suffers a military defeat . . . yet it's clear that this film is meant to serve as a warning , rather than a prophecy . ' The Battle Cry of Peace ' is crude and clumsy , even for its time . . . but its intentions are good , and its theme is more relevant today than it was in 1915 . I'll rate this movie .
Is that guy John Waters ?	' Six Cylinder Love ' is based on a stage play which dates back to the period ( before World War One ) when automobiles first became ( barely ) affordable for middle-class Americans , and when it was still somewhat of a novelty to own a car . . . or even to know somebody who owned one . The cast list implies that this is a Spencer Tracy movie . Spence is here , in comedy mode and near the top of his form , but he plays a supporting role and is absent for long stretches of this film . The main characters are Mr and Mrs Sterling , newlyweds . She's played by dull unattractive Sidney Fox , and he's played by Lorin Raker , of whom more later . SPOILERS COMING . Gilbert Sterling works for high-pressure auto salesman Donroy ( Tracy ) . The Sterlings buy a car from Donroy , but then discover they can't afford the upkeep . . . especially as their friends keep cadging rides . It transpires that Donroy previously sold the same car to the Sterlings ' neighbour next-door over , who resold it when he couldn't afford the upkeep either . The neighbour is named Richard Burton ( no comment ) , and is played by William Collier . . . who was getting jokes out of this same comedy situation back in silent days , in his movie " Wife and Auto Trouble " . Donroy is certain that he can resell the Sterlings ' car for them , if only he can find a ' minute man ' . . . which is his term for ' one of those born every minute ' . Eventually , Mrs Sterling has a smash-up which the Sterlings can't pay for , prompting meek Gil Sterling to embezzle the funds from his boss . There's a happy ending when the Sterlings sell the car to their apartment house's janitor , who has lots of cash from his second job as a bootlegger . ( He moonlights making moonshine . ) The humour in this movie is nearly as dated as the premise . Tracy's comedy style is impressive , but I stress that he plays a supporting role . For me , the most bizarre thing about this movie is the actor in the central role . Lorin Raker looks exactly like director John Waters ! Raker is a wispy little man , slightly effeminate , with a tiny Little Richard moustache . Except for the fact that John Waters has a broken blood vessel in one eye , he and Raker could be clones . All the time that Raker was on screen in this movie , I kept expecting Divine and Edith Massey to show up . I'll rate ' Six Cylinder Love ' , for the deft performances by several supporting players . . . including Spencer Tracy .
The regiment's darling	Elsie Janis was a child star in vaudeville : extremely talented and vivacious , she sang and danced and told jokes with equal facility . During the Great War ( by now in her late twenties ) she performed for the troops very close to the front lines . She appeared in a few of the very early Vitaphone talking-film shorts , then turned her talents away from performing to work as a scriptwriter for Cecil B . DeMille . Elsie Janis was not conventionally beautiful - - she had a slightly comic face , and her figure was not especially voluptuous - - but I find her extremely attractive . She's distinctive-looking ( in a pleasant way ) and her energy and her ingratiating personality are distinct assets . She probably could have had a successful film career playing roles similar to Marion Davies , in romantic comedies . " A Regular Girl " severely stints Elsie Janis's gift for comedy by casting her in a role that is almost entirely serious . She plays society girl Elizabeth Schuyler , daughter of a prominent financier and engaged to respectable Robert King . ( Played by handsome Matt Moore , who was usually cast in more downmarket roles . ) Stirred by patriotism during the War , Elizabeth works as a field nurse in France and is immediately popular with the doughboys in her assigned unit : specifically , four ' devil dogs ' named Mac , Shorty , Slim and Red . ( It's implausible that an overworked field nurse would spend so much time on just four soldiers , but what the heck . ) Because Elizabeth doesn't put on airs , her doughboys don't realise she's a society ' swell ' . After the Armistice , Elizabeth comes home , but she is permanently changed . She is less frivolous , and has a higher sense of purpose . Her doughboys are now ' forgotten men ' , who came home to discover that their civilian jobs have been taken by other men who stayed home . SPOILERS COMING . Knowing that her lads are too proud to accept help from a ' rich dame ' , Elizabeth takes the guise of a housemaid named ' Lizzie ' while using her family's influence to find jobs and stability for Mac , Shorty , Slim and Red . Her snobbish boyfriend Robert , who has waited for her through the war , is put off by Elizabeth's continued devotion to these four scruffy men who no longer serve a useful purpose . But gradually Robert is won over by Elizabeth's good works . A happy ending is had by all . Elsie Janis is excellent in a role which showcases her own real-life patriotism but which gives her few opportunities to display her comic talents or her dancing ability . Tammany Young , a distinctive actor best remembered as a stooge for W . C . Fields , is fine here as Mac , and the obscure actor Robert Ayerton is impressive as the Schuyler household's butler . But the film is poorly paced , and predictable . I'll rate this movie only . I'd like to rate it more highly , because it made a worthy attempt to remind civilians that the homefront has an obligation to the troops . That was an important message in 1919 , and it still is . . . now , more than ever .
Hardly their best work .	' Hook , Line and Sinker ' is the very generic title of this very generic comedy , starring Wheeler & Woolsey , who are very nearly the most generic comedy team of all time . ( That dubious honour goes to the Ritz Brothers . ) I consistently enjoy watching Wheeler & Woolsey , yet I frankly find them neither very good nor very original . Whenever Robert Woolsey pitches woo to some rich dowager ( as he does here , to Jobyna Howland ) , it's impossible to avoid thinking of Groucho Marx flirting with Margaret Dumont . . . and Woolsey suffers by comparison to the great Groucho . Wheeler & Woolsey are very similar to the much later British comedy team Morecambe & Wise . . . but I doubt that Eric and Ernie deliberately imitated Bob and Bert . Wheeler & Woolsey also remind me of their contemporaries Clark & McCullough , with Robert Woolsey sometimes seeming to do an outright imitation of Bobby Clark . In ' Hook , Line and Sinker ' , Wheeler & Woolsey make their entrance riding a two-seat tandem bike ; this immediately reminded me of the British comedians the Goodies , who rode a three-seat tridem ( which is funnier ) . More importantly , the Goodies got a large number of gags from their trademark tridem , whereas Wheeler & Woolsey abandon the tandem after its initial appearance . This seems to be the biggest problem with Wheeler & Woolsey : their inability to milk and develop a gag . In one of their films , W & W did a routine very similar to Abbott & Costello's ' Who's on First ' ( BEFORE Bud and Lou did it ) , yet they failed to develop this premise as richly as Bud and Lou would use it later . In fairness to Wheeler & Woolsey , part of their problem was their gag writers : most of the scripters who wrote material for W & W were concurrently also writing gags for the Marx Brothers , and the Marxes got first pick of all the best material . . . lumbering W & W with literally the leavings . At one point in ' Hook , Line and Sinker ' , the soundtrack plays Kalmar and Ruby's hit song ' Three Little Words ' , reminding me that Kalmar and Ruby ( who worked closely with the Marx Brothers ) wrote the best gags for ' Hips , Hips , Hooray ! ' , which is almost certainly Wheeler and Woolsey's funniest film : it features two delightful songs as well as some ingenious sight gags . ' Hook , Line and Stinker ' . . . sorry , ' Sinker ' . . . seems to borrow half its plot from the Marx Brothers ' previous film ' The Cocoanuts ' and its other half from the Marx Brothers ' ' Monkey Business ' , which actually hadn't been written yet when this movie was made . Bert and Bob are briefly insurance salesmen who chuck it to help Dorothy Lee run her hotel . As luck would have it , the hotel is also the secret hideout of some bootleggers , who check into the hotel with some luggage from the Acme Machine Gun Company ( a name you can trust ) . Dorothy Lee was Bert Wheeler's perennial love interest in these movies . Here , she's more annoying than usual , speaking her dialogue in a high-pitched squeal that ( unfortunately ) matches the annoying voice that Wheeler normally uses for his own gormless character . Their dialogue scenes in this movie sound like chalk on a slate . Bert and Dorothy do have one very amusing scene in which they flirt by pressing keys on a cash register ; unfortunately , the photography is too dim for us to see that Dorothy is pressing the " NO SALE " key . ( Or is this just down to a badly-processed nitrate print ? ) Throughout this film , the photography features undercranking at oddly-chosen moments . Amazingly , the funniest performance in this film ( as a precognitive bellhop ) is given by George Marion Snr , whom I usually find unbearable . I was also impressed by Hugh Herbert , who made this film before he developed the annoying " woo-woo " finger-patting routine that would ruin his performances in so many later films . Natalie Moorhead is amusing as an ersatz duchess whose Continental accent keeps coming and going , while William B Davidson plays a counterfeit duke who doesn't even bother attempting a phony accent . A few decades after this film was made , Jerry Lewis recycled the title ' Hook , Line & Sinker ' ( he preferred an ampersand ) for one of HIS worst comedies , which at least had the tiny merit of ( very ) vaguely having something to do with fishing . In this Wheeler & Woolsey film , the title's utterly irrelevant . ( Yes , I know that it's an American figure of speech roughly equivalent to ' the full monty ' . ) ' Hook , Line and Sinker ' is one of the weakest Wheeler & Woolsey films , and not a good introduction to Bert & Bob for audiences who have never seen this team before . Your introduction to W & W should be ' Hips , Hips Hooray ! ' or ' So This Is Africa ' , or even ' Rio Rita ' or ' Dixiana ' . I'll rate ' Hook ' just .
Take me to your lederhosen	' Ferien vom Ich ' ( ' Holiday from Myself ' ) is a weak film , although there are some pleasant exterior shots of the Bavarian countryside . The most interesting thing about this film is that it was made in Germany during the very early days of Hitler's premiership - - before the Third Reich caused most of its unpleasantries - - and , as such , it provides an interesting example of the German perception of Americans before WW2 compelled all loyal Nazis to see Americans as the enemy . It also provides some interesting depictions of mental illness , a few years before Hitler's propaganda machine encouraged the euthanasia of all mentally-ill German citizens for the ' greater good ' of the Herrenvolk . Hermann Braun plays a workaholic American industrialist whose physician ( Georg H Schnell ) orders him to go away for a rest cure to someplace where nobody knows him . Naturally , he chooses Bavaria . Rather than check into an existing spa , Braun buys the estate of an impoverished nobleman ( Friedrich Stampe ) . He then proceeds to tear most of it down and rebuild it from scratch as a sanitarium . After all this is done , and the sanitarium has been freshly stocked with patients , Braun shows up and checks himself in for a rest cure without revealing his true identity ( of course ) . SPOILERS COMING . At the sanitarium , he meets the beautiful young daughter ( Carola Höhn ) of the nobleman whose estate he's gutted . Naturally , she depises the millionaire . Naturally , she also falls in love with the sanitarium's new American patient . . . not realising that they're both the same man . Boring and unfunny complications ensue . Sadly , the other patients in the sanitarium are rather broad caricatures of mental patients : they act like the inmates in the old burlesque sketch ' Crazy House ' . They're clearly meant to be funny , yet I couldn't help recalling that - - soon after this film was made - - Hitler and Goering would urge the ' mercy killing ' of all mentally-disturbed or feeble-minded German citizens . As Germany and the United States were not yet at war in 1934 - - and , indeed , many American citizens ( especially German-Americans ) openly sympathised with Hitler's plans for Germany - - it's intriguing to see that this film's depiction of its American protagonist is entirely favourable and even admiring . It's clear that , at this date , Germans still admired Americans for their drive and optimism . When did things change ? I'll rate this mildly amusing movie , mostly for its historic aspects .
Don't buy peanuts from Bimbo .	' Boop-Oop-a-Doop ' is an early Betty Boop cartoon , from the period when the Fleischers were still imitating Disney . The cartoon starts with Betty dancing a shimmy . . . then the camera pulls back to reveal that this is actually a drawing of Betty on a circus banner , rippling in the wind . I laughed as I realised the meta-fiction aspect of this gag : it's not a drawing of the real Betty ( who's just a drawing ) , it's a drawing of a drawing of Betty . This time Betty works in the circus as a lion tamer , and I wonder if this 1932 cartoon inspired Mae West to play a lion tamer a few months later in ' I'm No Angel ' . An elephant lumbers past , bearing a giant inkwell on his back like a howdah , and Koko the Clown makes his familiar entrance out of the inkwell . Bimbo is with the circus too , as the peanut butcher , but his running gag has an unfunny payoff . Betty is pursued by the lustful ringmaster , whose moustache has a life of its own . He actually says ' Ah , me beauty ! ' . I was hoping he would catch Betty , so that I could find out precisely WHAT a male cartoon character intends to do with ( or to ) a female cartoon character . I guess I'll never know . Some of Betty Boop's songs feature double entrendres , but here she sings ' Don't take my " Boop-Oop-a-Doop " away ' , a sentiment which is a single entendre at best . I'll rate this toon .
The merry-go-round broke down .	During Hollywood's golden era , several of the major studios tried to offer a splashy musical comedy that went through annual editions . MGM had ' Broadway Melody of ( insert year ) ' . Paramount had ' The Big Broadcast of ( insert year ) ' . Warners had ' Gold Diggers of ( insert year ) ' . Typically , the date in the title was the year AFTER the film was released , so that the movie could remain in distribution for an entire year and still seem up-to-date . ' Merry-Go-Round of 1938 ' looks and sounds suspiciously like Universal Studios ' attempt to get in on this franchise . . . except that there was no sequel for 1939 nor any subsequent year . The most notable thing about this movie is its two top-billed actors . Bert Lahr plays a rare starring role here , as a vaudevillain clearly based on himself . Second-billed is Jimmy Savo , a wistful little comedian ( subclass Norman Wisdom ) who was briefly a star on Broadway but made very few films . This is probably Savo's best screen performance , yet the director seems to be deliberately cheating him . Savo had a pleasant singing voice : here , when he warbles a lullaby to an orphaned baby , his face is turned away from the camera to create the ( false ) impression that Savo's singing voice is dubbed . In a later sequence , Savo does a spirited eccentric dance . . . but the camera is so far away from him that the effect is diluted . Get this plot , now . Lahr , Savo , Mischa Auer and Billy House are the Grand Street Comedy Four , a vaude act who ( in 1918 ) play the same bill as aerialist Dainty Doris . Conveniently , Doris has just fallen off her trapeze : she survives just long enough to make the four comedians promise to raise her baby daughter Sally . A few years later , the Comedy Four have got themselves booked in the Palace . . . but , before they can play the date , their big break is lost when little Sally gives them all the mumps . Fade to 1938 , and some half-hearted attempts to make the four lead actors look older with makeup . 20-year-old Sally is now a vivacious young vocalist , who has got herself engaged to handsome society scion Tony Townsend . This is one of those annoying films in which there aren't any real problems , so the scriptwriter has got to throw phony obstacles in the characters ' paths . Tony and Sally want to get married , but she hasn't the heart to leave her four ' fathers ' , who are skint and will presumably starve without her . Fair enough , except that wealthy Tony offers to take care of them . Fair enough , except that the Comedy Four have their ' pride ' and won't accept ' charity ' . Why not consider it as compensation for taking care of an orphan who wasn't their responsibility ? Then we need an obstacle to the romance , so Sally visits Tony unexpectedly and finds some over-sized and unfashionable female clothes that look like they belong to Margaret Dumont . . . so , without giving him a chance to explain , she assumes that Tony's seeing another woman and she storms out . Oh , and Tony's aunt Hortense won't approve of the marriage if she finds out that Sally is a ( gasp ! ) entertainer . So what ? Those female clothes are part of the drag act of Billy House , a man of huge girth and microscopic acting talent . For implausible reasons , he masquerades as an aristocratic Englishwoman to call on Aunt Hortense . Their scenes together are excruciating : actress Alice Brady ( as Hortense ) borrows Billie Burke's twee mannerisms , and she actually comes off here as an even phonier female impersonator than House does . American actor Billy House's phony British accent is half-acceptable , which makes me wonder why he didn't attempt an English accent in the movie ' Bedlam ' , in which he played a genuine Englishman . After House finishes impersonating an Englishwoman , he utters some of that de-rigueur dialogue about how it ' sure feels good ' to get back into male clothing ( so we won't get any - - ahem ! - - ideas about him ) . House is the least talented of the four lead actors in this movie , yet he plays the leader of their vaude act . Mischa Auer is his usual sourpuss self here , but bereft of his moustache and looking handsomer than usual . He spends the final third of the film in Gunga Din drag and body paint as a fake fakir , with Savo as his ' swami-ette ' . Oddly , Auer's character has the genuine ability to levitate Lahr : a bizarre intrusion of the paranormal into a script which is otherwise all too earthbound . The high point of this film is when Lahr performs ' The Song of the Woodman ' . Lahr had enacted this skit in a Broadway revue ; it was one of his most popular set pieces , and this movie happily preserves Lahr's big comedy song on celluloid . Unfortunately , very little else in this movie is worth watching . I never fault a film for having a low production budget , but I'm always annoyed when film makers who know they're lumbered with a low budget obstinately go ahead with a plot about life among the millionaires . . . knowing full well they haven't the dosh to depict it properly . Aunt Hortense and her phony-baloney cronies are meant to be the upper crust , but the depictions of her mansion and other ' wealthy ' locales in this movie are laughable . There are some oddities in the credits . IMDb says that Fay Helm is uncredited for her brief role as the doomed aerialist : in fact , she IS billed . But the credits also list actor Charles Williams as Hollywood producer Dave Clark : that character is mentioned in the dialogue but never seen . Nor does Hattie McDaniel ( listed here as a maid ) show up , either . I suspect that scenes were written for these characters , but ' Merry-Go-Round of 1938 ' ran out of money before they were filmed . Maybe it's a good thing there was no ' Merry-Go-Round of 1939 ' .
Hava Nagila	' Halome Ami ' was filmed silent , with a post-dubbed soundtrack , so I'll review the image and the sounds separately . The film consists of travelogue footage of Eretz Israel : the Palestinian homeland of the Jewish people before the nation of Israel was officially recognised . There is some fascinating footage of collective farms ( were they already called ' kibbutzim ' at this early date ? ) , as well as a few Holy Land sites that are likely to be of greater interest to Christian viewers . There is also an enjoyable sequence with some Jewish girls performing a folk dance in festive costumes . The soundtrack consists primarily of post-dubbed narration , but there is also some singing ( a capella ) by Cantor Rosenblatt , who was apparently the guiding force behind this film . There are a few very crude musical passages . The entire film was clearly made on a very small budget ; the crudeness shows , and the director displays little aptitude for cinematic techniques . At the time when it was made , ' Halome Ami ' was probably intended to apprise audiences in America and Europe of the ongoing struggles of the Eretz Israelis to reclaim a homeland for themselves . This movie is definitely a piece of propaganda , although ' propaganda ' is not necessarily an unfavourable term . Viewed from a modern standpoint , when the filmmakers ' Zionist cause has long since been achieved , this movie's original purpose is no longer relevant . Fortunately , ' Halome Ami ' is still a compelling film , due to its historical interest . And for those who are not especially interested in Israel's history , the travelogue footage and the folk dance sequences are still enjoyable . I commend this movie's good intentions , but they are only partially successful . I'll rate ' Halome Ami ' .
' Battling Butler ' on horseback	' The Hottentot ' has strong similarities to Buster Keaton's film ' Battling Butler ' , made a few years later . In both movies , the main character is ( at the beginning ) an ineffectual and clumsy man who coincidentally has the same name as a popular athlete . In both movies , mistaken identity leads the klutz to substitute for his athletic namesake . Both films are comedies , yet in each case the story leads to a dead-earnest climax in which the protagonist must suddenly develop athletic prowess . Also , both films were based on successful stage plays : ' The Hottentot ' was originally a play by veteran stage actor Willie Collier . The stagebound origins presented no problem for ' Battling Butler ' , in which the central sport was boxing . But the sport in ' The Hottentot ' is steeplechase racing , which is nearly impossible to depict in a theatrical production . When ' The Hottentot ' played onstage , the climactic events had to occur offstage . In this film , no such problem occurs . Douglas MacLean ( a fine light comedian ) plays Sam Harrington , a high-strung young man who happens to have the same name as a popular steeplechase jockey . Sam ( this one ) has never been on a horse in his life , and in fact he's afraid of horses . But he enjoys impressing people who think he's the famous jockey . To take advantage of this , Sam starts strutting about in riding boots and jockey silks , while boasting of his race victories . Eventually the imposture gets out of hand , requiring Sam to substitute for his namesake in a real steeplechase . He reluctantly goes along with this , hoping to impress pretty Peggy Fairfax . Come the day of the race , Sam discovers that the horse selected for him to ride is a notoriously ferocious black stallion . . . the Hottentot ! Comic events ensue . ' The Hottentot ' is an amusing comedy that never becomes first-rate , largely due to the unconvincing staging of the racing sequences , but also due to the bland performance of Madge Bellamy in the female lead . Another similarity between this film and ' Battling Butler ' is that , in both movies , the hero receives substantial assistance from his loyal manservant . In the case of ' Battling Butler ' , Keaton is abetted by his resourceful valet Snitz Edwards . In ' The Hottentot ' , the best performance is given by Raymond Hatton as Sam's unflappable butler named Swift . ( Swift by name , yet hardly Swift by nature . ) But ' The Hottentot ' is not so hot . ' Battling Butler ' is better . In the early 1960s , an interviewer asked Buster Keaton to name his favourite of his films : Keaton was expected to plump for ' The General ' or ' The Navigator ' , but he surprised everyone by choosing ' Battling Butler ' . . . probably because of its deadly-serious climax . I also consider ' Battling Butler ' the most generic of Keaton's films : it's the only one of Keaton's starring vehicles in which I can most easily imagine almost any other silent-film leading man doing as well in the lead role . ' The Hottentot ' has the same feel as ' Battling Butler ' but isn't nearly as good . I'll rate this movie . Whoa , horsey !
Crude but delightful .	Another " lost " film back from the dead ! I viewed " Peg o ' the Mounted " - - lost for years , but now found again - - at the 2006 Cinema Muto festival in Sacile , Italy . Even more impressively , at the same screening I got to meet this film's star ! Diana Serra Cary , who once performed as ' Baby Peggy ' , is still alive and well with a delightfully capacious memory of her silent-film days . She was kind enough to answer my questions and pose for a photograph with me . The Baby Peggy comedies , though extremely crude and made on a cheapjack budget , were immensely popular . ( Ms Cary told me they were ground out in five days apiece . ) " Peg o ' the Mounted " has a title which seems to parody " Peg o ' My Heart " , though its plot line seems to anticipate " Susanna of the Mounties " . This short stands out from the rest of the series by virtue of being filmed in Yosemite Valley , and there are some stirring location shots here . For some reason , Baby Peggy is living in the Yukon , where she has some sort of domestic relationship with a big strapping Mountie . Normally , the Mountie always gets his man , but this time he's been nobbled by a moonshiner . It doesn't help when Baby Peggy doses the Mountie with castor oil and Sloan's Liniment . Then she puts on her own Mountie uniform and vows to capture the moonshiner herself . The villain of this piece is played by Jack Earle , a pituitary giant who stood just under eight feet tall . When he stands beside Baby Peggy , we see that he is more than twice her height ! Earle , who was Jewish , had extremely Semitic features . . . which is unfortunate in this context ; cast in a villain role , Earle looks more than a little like one of those Shylockish Jewish villains . Most giants are physically weak , so it's astonishing to see how easily Earle hefts his massive frame across the screen . At one point , Earle picks up Baby Peggy and tosses her what looks like half a mile away ! The trick photography - - a jump cut , and the substitution of a doll for the live girl - - is intentionally so obvious that we laugh rather than cringing in sympathy . The Baby Peggy films tend to have a gentle humour , dealing more in twee reversals and cuteness rather than belly-laughs . I'll rate this just . Postscript : Jack Earle left movies to perform in the Sells and Flotos Circus . He had the odd luck to sustain a minor head injury in a car accident ; the injury suppressed his pituitary gland and stopped his growth ! He lived to be 46 , an astonishingly long lifespan for a giant .
Insert Gallic shrug here .	The title and subtitle of this French miniseries are " Six Times Two ; Over and under the media " . The " six " refers to the fact that there are six episodes ; the " two " has a double meaning . Each of these episodes is a collaboration between two people : Jean-Luc Godard and his long-time partner Anne-Marie Miéville , but the " two " also refers to the fact that each episode has a two-part structure . The individual episodes run 100 minutes each , split almost precisely into two 50-minute sections . Each episode deals with a specific theme - - history , women , labour - - with the first half being an overview of that topic , and the second half being a documentary interview with one person who somehow represents that very broad topic ! This is a thoroughly Gallic documentary series , with everything that the term implies ; despite my passion for Godard's films , I found ' Six Times Two ' to be extremely talkative and static . Reportedly , Godard himself did not have a high opinion of this miniseries .
You are getting sleepy . . . very sleepy . . .	Many European actors who fled the Nazis brought their talents to Hollywood , usually in supporting roles due to the limitations of their European accents . Siegfried Arno was a star in German comedies who went on to a respectable career in Hollywood as a character comedian in small supporting roles . ' Ein Ausgekochter Junge ' ( ' A Young Good-for-Nothing ' ) has Arno in a lead role , speaking his native language . This film demonstrates Arno's talents more fully than most of his Hollywood work ; unfortunately , it also shows he's not all that talented . Arno plays Ignaz Fischbein ( literally , ' fish-leg ' ) , a hapless shop assistant in Herr Strohbach's couture salon . The bank holiday weekend is coming , and Strohbach plans a nice holiday for himself and his wife ( so he claims ) at a Bavarian inn . He orders Fischbein to make the travel arrangements , then sends him out to make a delivery to a woman named Rolly-Polly , who does a cooch dance at a local carnival . Also at the carnival are a couple of newlyweds : sexy young Mitzi , and her hulking hubby Paul , who drives a beer truck . While Paul makes a delivery , Mitzi wanders onto the carnival's midway . At the sideshow , Fischbein stops to watch the performance of Brahmaputra , a Hindu fakir . Or maybe a faker : Brahmaputra is played by a German actor ( Albert Paulig ) in heavy pancake makeup . The makeup job is so bad and so obvious that I assumed Paulig was actually playing a German who is pretending he's a Hindu . No ; apparently the character is a genuine East Indian , but the Germans who made this movie weren't able to find an authentic Hindu actor for the role . Or they didn't bother . Brahmaputra demonstrates his mystic powers by mesmerising Fischbein and Mitzi , and hypnotising them to believe they're newlyweds on their honeymoon . I thought at first that Fischbein and Mitzi were going to pretend to be hypnotised , so that they could rush off for a dirty weekend together and claim afterwards that they'd been brainwashed . No ; Fischbein and Mitzi are genuinely convinced that they're married . Mitzi sees Rolly-Polly's frock and thinks it's her own trousseau . Fischbein finds the railway tickets he bought for Strohbach , and he assumes that these are the tickets for his own honeymoon with Mitzi . So , Mr and Mrs Fischbein , travelling as Mr and Mrs Strohbach , end up at the Bavarian inn just in time to bump into Strohbach and his wife . . . except that she isn't really his wife ; she's his mistress Evchen . Meanwhile , Paul shows up with the hypnotist , determined to break up the Fischbein ' marriage ' and reclaim his wife . There's a lot of shouting and overacting . Buried under the argle-bargle is some genuine humour , but not much . I was intrigued to see the Hungarian actor Charles Puffy in this film : he had a respectable career in Hollywood during the late silent-film era , but returned to Europe when his accent put paid to his career in talking pictures . Puffy , a very large and unappetising man , is funny here as a political hothead . The camera work and the soundtrack music are better than I'd expected . I'll rate this movie .
Goodbye , Mr Chimps	I saw ' The Monkey Talks ' in October 1998 , at the Pordenone Silent Film Festival in Italy . The main character in ' The Monkey Talks ' is a man who spends most of his time on screen disguised as a chimpanzee . . . and successfully deceiving close observers . Without relying on camera tricks , it's probably impossible for a man to credibly impersonate a chimpanzee : " Hollywood ' ( 1923 ) and " Bikini Beach " ( 1964 ) both feature chimpanzee characters played by human actors , and the trickery is obvious . In " The Playhouse " , Buster Keaton is hilarious as a man who impersonates a chimp , but we never expect anyone to be fooled by the imposture . However , the plot line of " The Monkey Talks " absolutely requires us to believe that a human can credibly impersonate a chimpanzee at close quarters for prolonged periods . " The Monkey Talks " would probably never have been filmed at all , had not Jacques Lerner already starred in a stage version of this story . Lerner was a small , lithe , graceful man ( which helps ) , and his chimpanzee costume is impressive ( it includes a " monkey jacket " like the one worn by Manuel the waiter in ' Fawlty Towers ' ) . Lerner's performance is spellbinding but never quite convincing , especially not in the close-ups ( despite some splendid make-up appliances by Jack Pierce ) . It doesn't help that this silent film's dialogue cards ( and the film's title ) refer to Lerner as a " monkey " when he is clearly meant to be a chimpanzee . Worse luck , he's supposed to be impersonating a talking chimpanzee . Lerner speaks repeatedly ( in the intertitles ) whilst wearing his chimp disguise , yet none of his victims ever consider the possibility that this talking " chimp " is actually a man in a costume . ( And how does he relieve himself ? ) However , this film stars Olive Borden , who is one of the most incredibly beautiful ( and sexy ) women I've ever seen on screen , just a narrow notch beneath Danielle Ouimet in " Le rouge aux lèvres " . The relationship between this beautiful actress and Lerner's chimp-man ( trapped inside his confining costume ) is exceedingly kinky . Lerner plays one of a group of circus people ( including an impoverished nobleman ) who are down on their luck , and skint with it . To make money , they disguise Lerner and they exhibit him as a talking chimp ( sorry , " monkey " ) . Everyone falls for this con . Eventually , they sell the " monkey " to beautiful Olivette ( Borden ) who regards the cute little monkey as her confidant , never suspecting that he's actually a man who is in love with her . ( And who very likely has the hots for her . ) Will there be some monkey lovin ' ? Credibility breathes its last gasp when a jealous suitor abducts the talking " chimp " and substitutes a real chimp . ) The ' real ' chimpanzee is also played by a human : a stuntman in an ill-fitting costume , who is larger than Jacques Lerner . It doesn't help matters that Lerner ( playing a fake chimp ) is much more convincing than the stuntman who is portraying a genuine biological specimen of chimpanzee-dom . In my first attempt to review ' The Monkey Talks ' , I managed to get this film confused with the 1925 version of ' The Unholy Three ' , in which an actual chimpanzee is cast in the role of a gorilla . . . a very dis-similar simian . The chimpanzee who plays a gorilla in that movie is about as unconvincing as the stuntman who plays a chimpanzee in ' The Monkey Talks ' . When I originally viewed this movie , I was so distracted by Olive Borden's erotic performance that I couldn't keep track of the apes without a scorecard . This movie does contain a fine performance by Raymond Hitchcock as a pickpocket , one of Lerner's confederates . Hitchcock was an extremely popular stage comedian ( he starred in Ziegfeld's Follies on Broadway ) but he made very few films . Director Raoul Walsh keeps the action going , but he can't inject plausibility into this orangutangle . I'll rate ' The Monkey Talks ' , but at least one of those points is for the extremely beautiful ( and sexy ) Olive Borden .
proto-Keystone slapstick	A previous IMDb reviewer has stated that Jeanie Macpherson , who appears in this film , was Cecil B . DeMille's wife . That's not correct . Macpherson had a long and significant career as DeMille's favourite scenarist ; she wrote or co-wrote the scripts for many of DeMille's most important films and quite a few of his obscure films . Macpherson ( who appears in this movie as a young flirt ) was quite attractive in her younger days , and there are rumours that she and DeMille had a long sexual relationship . But she was definitely never married to him . ' Father Gets in the Game ' features Mack Sennett - - the future king of Keystone - - in unconvincing makeup and whitened hair as Wilkins , an ageing man who watches enviously as his adult son courts the pretty young ladies . Wilkins goes to a hairdresser for a dye job : the hairdresser is named Dyem , which tells you what sort of comedy this is . Conveniently youthened ( and looking much more like Sennett's actual appearance at this time ) , Wilkins goes forth with lecherous intentions . He flirts with various young ladies ( including Macpherson and Linda Arvidson ) , some of them more friendly than others . Slapstick complications ensue , with a few proto-Keystone pratfalls . The most interesting aspect of this early comedy is the inclusion of some exterior sequences shot in Central Park , with some genuine pedestrians caught by the camera . I'll rate ' Father Gets in the Game ' , mostly for its historical significance .
Gorgeous Gothic , scrawny script	" The Lady's Maid's Bell " is one of those ever-so-earnest British TV productions with all the elements that make this sort of programming so popular with the Anglophiles who watch PBS in America : a period setting , elaborate production design , a wide range of Brit accents up and down the social scale , and a script based on a story by some famous dead person . This one is based on a tale by Edith Wharton , an author whom I find extremely boring . I've tried and failed to read several of her works , but I've never even attempted to read the story on which this TV movie is based , so I can't judge how faithful the adaptation is . This review addresses only the Granada teleplay , not Wharton's original story . " The Lady's Maid's Bell " was filmed as an episode of Granada TV's 7-episode anthology series ' Shades of Darkness ' . Each episode of this series was a stand-alone story , all of them spooky in tone . Isaac Asimov once summed up the entire Gothic genre as follows : ' A woman gets a house ' . Gothic novels as disparate as ' Jane Eyre ' , ' The Turn of the Screw ' and ' Rebecca ' all follow the same formula : a young woman with limited options must journey to an old grand house in an isolated location , where a strict authority figure demands utter obedience from her . And the house has a Dark Secret . . . " The Lady's Maid's Bell " conforms to the mixture as before , in every particular . The house even has a mysterious room , into which the female protagonist must never , ever go . . . As so often in Gothic novels and films , the female protagonist supplies her own narration here . Miss Hartley speedily identifies the present year as 1902 , which feels suspiciously like an addition to Wharton's text by the modern scriptwriter . Miss Hartley has spent her life in service , but she recently contracted typhoid and so has had difficulty obtaining employment as a lady's maid . ( Actress Joanna David looks only very slightly gaunt and pale in her role as a typhoid victim in the anaemic Edwardian era . ) She applies to several positions by post , and is accepted ( sight unseen ) to serve at Brympton Hall , as the personal maid of Mrs Brympton , a chronic invalid . We never learn where Brympton Hall is : judging from the accents of the locals , I'd guess West Riding in Yorkshire . The house has all the Gothic elements . A forbidden room and a dark secret are just for starters , to be getting on with . The butler Wace is a religious fanatic , and the master of the house is a tyrant : fortunately , Mr Brympton is only ever home at weekends . Mrs Brympton sends Miss Hartley into town to fill a receipt at the dispensing chemist , and ( oh , yes ) while she is there , to deliver a message to a certain gentleman . ( Shades of L . P . Hartley's " The Go-Between " . ) But the pharmacist reveals that the receipt is merely for lime water ( calcium carbonate solution ) . Are the prescriptions merely a pretext for the messages , or is Mrs Brympton's ailment only a delusion ? As in ' Rebecca ' fashion , the heroine is in the shadow of her predecessor . Mrs Brympton's previous maid was Emma , who gave 20 years ' long service but died mysteriously . So then why does Miss Hartley still see Emma's ghostly figure ? Some of the servants hint that they could reveal dark secrets , if they chose . ( I truly hate this sort of hinting dialogue : either tell what you know , or keep silent . ) SPOILERS COMING . This telefilm makes several bad errors . The spookiest movie ever made is ' The Innocents ' , which has a story similar to this one . But ' The Innocents ' derives most of its power from the ambiguous nature of the horror . The haunted governess sees the ghost of Peter Quint only as a distant shadow , until she sees a photo of Quint's face . . . then she sees the ghost clearly , so we never know if the haunting is genuine or a product of her imagination . In " The Lady's Maid's Bell " , Miss Hartley sees Emma's face distinctly when she first enters the house , even though they've never met before . . . so we know the ghost must be genuine . Later , Emma leads Miss Hartley onto the lawn . Emma's face shimmers weirdly , and we expect her to vanish in ghostly fashion . . . but this turns out to be the director's clumsy attempt at a dissolve to a closer shot of the same image ! Just then a manservant arrives , prompting a cut to Miss Hartley from a different angle , standing alone on the lawn . So Emma must be a genuine ghost , not a Scooby-Doo spook , because no human could have vanished from an open space so quickly . This telefilm does have some merits . I'm a sucker for any movie depicting a maidservant tending her mistress's hair or clothing , especially if they're both in Victorian or Edwardian costume . But the kink quotient is decidedly low hereabouts . The greatest asset of this low-budget film is its primary location : the exteriors were filmed at Arley Hall , Budworth , near Northwich in Cheshire . This beautiful house and its spacious lawns are a real feast for the eye . Although filmed on a low budget , the period detail throughout this movie is impeccable . Regrettably , the Deep Dark Secret is a disappointing one . I'll rate " The Lady's Maid's Bell " only .
If you were the last man on Earth . . .	" It's Great to Be Alive " is one of the weirdest movies I've ever seen . It's a science-fiction comedy , similar in spirit to " Just Imagine " ( 1930 ) , although not quite as musicalised . This is a dumb movie , but it's so cheerful in its mindlessness that you'll have a good time watching it . . . ONCE . I'm not sure it would stand up under repeated viewing . A major flaw is the casting of Raul Roulien ( a bland and untalented actor ) in the central role . Carlos Martin ( Roulien ) is a dashing young aviator . When his girlfriend jilts him , he decides to forget her by embarking on a trans-Pacific solo flight . ( That'll do nicely . ) His aeroplane develops engine trouble mid-ocean , and he is forced to land on one of those tiny little uninhabited islands that show up so frequently in magazine cartoons . Meanwhile , the entire world suffers from a global epidemic of a new disease called masculitis . All male humans are rendered sterile . We see a weird scene in which two uncredited actors wearing bizarre makeup and fright wigs give a bad imitation of two scientists trying to find a cure for masculitis . One of the actors ( the one with a bushy grey fright wig and a cod German accent ) is apparently meant to be Einstein ; the other one ( with a bushy black fright wig and a cod French accent ) is obviously meant to be a real person too : it took me several minutes to figure out that he was impersonating Auguste Piccard , a scientist who was briefly famous in the 1930s . Anyway , not even Piccard and Einstein can cure masculitis : the human race is doomed ! There are some amusing scenes in which we see that all of humanity's institutions continue , but now they're run entirely by women . This includes the criminal underworld : public enemy # 1 is now a she-gangster who seems to be a combination of Al Capone and Bugs Moran , who styles herself Al Moran ( why not Bugs Capone ? ) . She's the leader of an all-girl gang of racketeers . The League of Nations are nowhere to be seen ( no loss ) , but we now have a Worldwide Congress , presided over by a woman physician named Doctor Prodwell . ( That name was used previously in ' The Last Man on Earth ' , a silent film with the exact same premise as this one . ) Dr Prodwell is played hilariously by Edna May Oliver , who gives the best performance in this movie . Edna May Oliver had a long distinguished career in dramatic roles , but only just occasionally had an opportunity to demonstrate her flair for comedy . She's brilliant here ; this performance belongs in a much better movie . Eventually , Carlos escapes that island to rejoin humanity , and he discovers that he's the last remaining fertile man . He is promptly kidnapped by Al Moran's all-gal gang , who try to auction him off . . . until the G-women ( not G-men ) arrive and declare him federal property . But now the Worldwide Congress want his services . Dr Prodwell decides that the women of each nation should purvey their charms for Carlos , and he will decide which nation he will repopulate first . ( Nice work if you can get it . ) This movie makes a half-hearted attempt at being a musical , with occasional songs . There is a very strange musical climax resembling one of those burlesque-show ' Girls of All Nations ' routines , in which each nation's finest female pulchritude display themselves for Carlos's approval . This number features some wince-making lyrics , such as : ' We are the women of Czechoslovakia . We are strong , and how we can sockya . " The tunes and lyrics are awful , which may explain why no songwriters are credited . " It's Great to Be Alive " is basically a dirty joke , spun out to second-feature proportions . It's worth seeing , just to get an idea of how weird Hollywood movies could become during the Depression . By the way , in 1946 a best-selling novel ( ' Mr Adam ' by Pat Frank ) used almost an identical premise ( a nuclear experiment renders all males infertile , except one simpleton who was down a mineshaft at the time ) and made a very funny story indeed : much funnier than this movie . I'll rate " It's Great to Be Alive " .
Passable ' Pim ' , possibly past .	A . A . Milne is of course remembered for ' Winnie the Pooh ' , but during his lifetime he was known for a wide range of writings . He regularly contributed humour pieces to ' Punch ' magazine , and his novel ' The Red House Mystery ' ( a whodunit that's also a howdunit ) was in the 1930s considered one of the great works of detective fiction . ( It is now seriously dated . ) Milne was a striking figure , with his blond hair and piercing bright blue eyes : for maximum effect , he often dressed in suits of the exact same distinctive blue as his eyes , and he was nicknamed ' Blue ' by his friends because of this . Milne was also a playwright of some success in his lifetime ; here too , his work has sadly dated . Milne first achieved success as the author of ' Toad of Toad Hall ' , a stage dramatisation of Kenneth Grahame's classic ' The Wind in the Willows ' . This was Milne's favourite novel , and he would often appraise new acquaintances by mentioning ' Willows ' in the conversation so that he could observe their response . It's notable that Milne's books about Pooh and Christopher Robin are illustrated by Ernest Shepherd , who had previously illustrated ' The Wind in the Willows ' . ' Mr Pim Passes By ' is the film version of one of Milne's more successful plays . The opening credits list Milne's play as the source , but ( in the print I screened ) no scenarist is identified as author of the adaptation . Milne's stage play is an unfortunate vehicle for adaptation as a silent film , as most of the humour in this comedy of manners derives from the dialogue . This film ( by a director unknown to me ) features many , many intertitles with long , long pieces of dialogue in them . . . but I don't believe that the director or scenarist should be blamed ; this particular material just doesn't work very well without audible voices handling the dialogue . ' Pim ' is a comedy of a very English sort , and even in England this type of humour is no longer in fashion . Olivia Marsden was formerly married to Jacob Tellworthy , but he died during a period when they were physically separated , so she only learnt of his death second-hand . ( They were emotionally estranged all along . ) Five years ago , she married the much older George Marsden : a wealthy skinflint from a blueblood family , who rules Marsden House ( his stately home ) as an absolute tyrant . Olivia has no say in the household's affairs , no power over her own life . Neither does her daughter Diana , who is in love with the aptly-named Brian Strange . . . who is meant to be a sympathetic character ( the juvenile lead ) , yet whom I despised straight off . Brian Strange is one of those sensitive young artists who insist on painting landscapes that don't resemble anything seen in nature . ( One intertitle identifies him as a ' modernist ' . ) George Marsden absolutely dominates his wife and stepdaughter , and forbids Diana to have any contact with Strange . One day , into Marsden House ambles the absent-minded Mr Pim , seeking an introduction to the neighbour next-door over . Overhearing a reference to Jacob Tellworthy , he speaks of him in the present tense . It seems that Tellworthy is in fact alive ; Mr Pim knows him quite well , and saw him only just recently . Having dropped this bombshell , Mr Pim ambles off . Olivia and her oh-so-very respectable husband ( to say nothing of his mother , the dowager Lady Marsden ) are scandalised to learn that their marriage is illegal , and that Olivia is guilty of bigamy . Now along comes Mr Pim again , with a new bit of information . It seems that Tellworthy was indeed alive all these years , but he has just lately died . Olivia is indeed a widow , but she and Marsden have been living together all these years in an illegal marriage . Scandalous ! Having dropped this second bombshell , Mr Pim once again ambles off . By pulling a few strings , Marsden contrives to file a backdated marriage certificate . But Olivia refuses to consent to this . SPOILERS COMING . Realising that Marsden is desperate to remarry her ( for the sake of his own reputation ) , Olivia renegotiates the terms of their marriage : she will receive more household money and some new drapes . Oh , and while he's about it , Marsden is to consent to his stepdaughter Diana's engagement to that modernist ' artist ' . Happy endings all round ( for all except Marsden ) . . . and now once again Mr Pim passes by . It seems he's just remembered that the fellow he knew wasn't Jacob Tellworthy after all . It was someone named Polwittle ! ' Mr Pim Passes By ' does not make a wholly successful transfer to the silent screen , as it is dependent upon so much dialogue that must be read in the intertitles . All of the actors give good performances ; in one case , perhaps too good . Henry Kendall succeeds so thoroughly in conveying the arty-tarty pretensions of the ' modernist ' painter Strange , he makes it clear that Strange is a dilettante and that Marsden is absolutely right to thwart his romance with Marsden's stepdaughter . I was disappointed that Diana is permitted to throw her life away on this berk . Campbell Gullan is doddering and indecisive in the title role , but that's appropriate to the character . In all , I'll rate ' Mr Pim Passes By ' .
Good golly gosh !	' Bhoot ' is the Hindi word for ' ghost ' , so this Bollywood spook-movie has a generic title . . . and that's a symptom of this film's biggest problem . ' Bhoot ' offers a pick-'n'-mix of scenes inspired by earlier ( and better ) movies , including ' The Tenant ' , ' The Exorcist ' , ' Carnival of Souls ' , ' Repulsion ' , ' Don't Look Now ' , ' Vertigo ' , ' Rosemary's Baby ' , ' Cat People ' , ' Rebecca ' and the greatest ghost movie of them all : ' The Innocents ' . Some of the soundtrack stings in this movie evoke Bernard Herrmann's famous music cues from ' Psycho ' . The movie opens with a title card bearing a personal message from the director , informing us that he made this movie only to scare us , and that we should not infer that it reflects his personal beliefs concerning the supernatural . Fair enough . Then there's a very effective opening sequence , with some jarring and disorienting shots of Bombay traffic . Extremely well done , this . . . but it's nothing to do with the rest of the movie . Vishal and Swati are a young Bombay married couple , very much in love . The dialogue establishes Vishal as a stockbroker , although the very brief scenes in his workplace depict some sort of generic desk job . He and Swati move into a 12th-storey duplex flat , formerly occupied by a young woman named Manjeet , now dead : apparently she went insane and jumped off the balcony . Vishal knows the flat's history but doesn't tell his wife . It quickly becomes obvious that Manjeet's ghost still haunts the flat . Swati sees her in the mirror . An American rag doll , apparently Manjeet's , is found in the apartment and claimed by Swati . When the couple visit a local funfair , Manjeet appears on the beach and pursues Swati . Eventually , Swati is possessed by the dead woman's spirit . A ghost-boy , his presence unexplained , keeps appearing . SLIGHT SPOILERS COMING . This film has many moody set-pieces , but they never form a coherent whole . The haunting follows no rules . If Manjeet died on the pavement outside the building , why is her ghost inside the upstairs duplex ? An apparently genuine clairvoyant ( played by the very beautiful Mekha ) is summoned , yet she walks right through the ghost-boy without seeing him . When Swati realises that Manjeet's ghost is real and malevolent , she comforts herself by cuddling Manjeet's doll ; this makes no dramatic sense . The building complex has one of those spooky-movie stock characters : the Creepy Caretaker Who Knows a Dark Secret . . . until Vishal finds this guy dead with his head twisted back-to-front ; if the ghost can do things like this by herself , why does she need to possess Swati's body ? Eventually , we learn that Manjeet and her young son ( the actual owner of the doll ) were murdered by the landlord's son Sanjay . In a creepy sequence worthy of Val Lewton , Manjeet confronts Sanjay in the underground garage , then she takes control of his car's steering wheel without touching it . Then she levitates him . If she can do all this to the man who murdered her , why is she wasting time with the innocent Swati ? Answer : because the director wanted a moody ' Exorcist'-style sequence . Most of this movie is by the numbers . The camera tracks towards the closed eyelids of a corpse . You guessed it : the eyes pop open . When anyone travels from the building's 12th storey to the ground or vice versa , we see a portentous shot of the dark lift shaft : this seems to foreshadow a climactic scene in the lift shaft , but no such climax ever comes . Vishal and Swati have his-'n'-hers nightmares , in two separate sequences - - Swati's nightmare clearly inspired by ' Carnival of Souls ' - - but these are merely bonus ' boo ! ' bits , irrelevant to the storyline . There are several excellent set-pieces in ' Bhoot ' , and the director is talented . I liked the breezy montage effect when Vishal and Swati bring the furniture into their new flat . There's a well-edited and ( for a Bollywood film ) surprisingly erotic sequence when Vishal and Swati make love while watching the BBC World News : very impressive , but leading to nothing . There's an amusing scene when Vishal wants to go to the cinema to see ' Spider-Man ' but Swati prefers a chick-flick . ( Very obvious product-placement shot for Imax Cinemas . ) A subplot about a girl with leukaemia goes nowhere . Confusingly , most of the dialogue in this film is in Hindi , but the actors periodically lapse into English for a few seconds , then they revert to Hindi . All of the dialogue is post-dubbed , very badly . ' The Innocents ' was a very frightening film , because we never learn with certainty whether the ghosts in that movie were genuine phantasms or merely hallucinations of the disturbed governess . In ' Bhoot ' , we ( the audience ) see the ghost before any of the on screen characters see her , so we know straight off that the spectre is real . This is a fatal error . Too much of ' Bhoot ' is derivative and generic , yet the director shows sufficient talent that I look forward to his next film . ' Bhoot ' has some ' boo ! ' but not very much boot . Sorry , but I rate this movie only .
Hang up , Cohen !	I first heard about ' Cohen on the Telephone ' in a roundabout way . One of the most hilarious pieces by the brilliant humour author S . J . Perelman is ' Waiting for Santy ' , a brilliantly funny parody of Clifford Odets's deadly-serious stage plays . Even if you're not familiar with Odets's work , ' Waiting for Santy ' is hilarious . However , in the middle of this parody , Perelman makes an off-hand reference to something called ' Cohen on the Telephone ' , with no further explanation . It took me nearly thirty years to track it down . ' Cohen on the Telephone ' was a vaudeville turn , eventually recorded on an early gramophone disc ( which is how Perelman identified it ) , and then remade as an early talking film . Many of the early talkies ( notably the Vitaphone shorts , filmed in Brooklyn ) were recordings of vaudeville acts , but the Vitaphones were nearly always musical or comedy acts which needed to be seen AND heard so as to retain their full effect . To the extent that it has any effect at all , ' Cohen on the Telephone ' - - an early vaudeville short which is NOT by Vitaphone - - is a dialect monologue : it's purely verbal , and ( at least as filmed here ) we get nothing from watching this vaudeville turn on screen which we wouldn't get if we were merely hearing this material as a radio broadcast or phonograph record . Character actor George Sidney specialised in playing Jewish stereotypes . Sometimes he was allowed to give them some depth and compassion , such as his sensitive performance in ' Manhattan Melodrama ' , as the grieving father who adopted two boys after losing his own son . Far too often , though , he simply played a money-grubbing Yiddish-spouting mangler of English . That's the role Sidney plays here . With the camera nailed to the floor , Cohen ( Sidney ) picks up an old-fashioned candlestick telephone and attempts to make an insurance claim on his house , in a thick Yiddisher accent . ' Hello , are you dere ? De vind blew down mine house . ' Much of the very crude humour stems from the fact that Cohen has a bad connexion ( or just can't handle a telephone ) and is obliged to start his call over several times . ' Hello , are you dere ? ' Ethnic humour doesn't date very well , as we now recognise the strong streak of cruelty behind it . Here , the audience are invited to laugh at how stupid Cohen is , and how much difficulty he has in making a simple phone call . The fact that he's trying to claim financial compensation ( to which he's probably entitled ) could arguably be construed as one more example of Jewish money-grubbing . If ethnic stereotypes offend you , so will this movie . Despite my reservations , I actually laughed several times during this short film , due to Sidney's sheer professionalism with this bad material , and at the utter outrageousness of Cohen's incompetence . This film has some historic significance as an example of the sort of material which was considered perfectly acceptable in vaudeville days , and I'll rate it . If you really want to laugh , read S . J . Perelman's " Waiting for Santy " in his hilarious collection ' The Most of S . J . Perelman ' .
Uncle Fester turns into a girl .	If you want to see a movie about a boy who runs away to join the circus and becomes a girl , here it is . James Otis Kaler was an extremely prolific author of boys ' novels , all of which have vanished into obscurity except one : ' Toby Tyler ' , the tale of an abused boy who runs away and joins the circus . ' Circus Days ' , intended as a star vehicle for child actor Jackie Coogan , is based on that novel . . . yet radically alters the material . ( Which may explain why the film studio did not use the title of the original novel - - still hugely popular in 1923 - - for this movie . ) In 1960 , ' Toby Tyler ' was remade by Walt Disney . . . and again , the film radically deviated from the novel . But these two film versions deviate from the novel in very different directions . SLIGHT SPOILERS . Young Toby ( Coogan ) is constantly beaten , whipped and overworked by Eben Holt , his mother's sister's husband . When Toby accidentally breaks Holt's chinaware , he is terrified that he'll receive another flogging . He runs away , and lands up with a convenient circus in which he gets a job as a concessionaire , selling lemonade and other snacks . The original novel got a whole chapter out of Toby's ordeal when one of his customers slips him a bad nickel . In the Disney movie , that incident is reduced to one line of dialogue . ' Circus Days ' substitutes a very implausible sequence in which Toby accidentally fills lemonade glasses with petrol , and sells this to customers . . . who don't notice the switch until they drink it . Surely the colour and the fumes would tip them off ? A kindly circus clown ( Cesare Gravina : a good performance in a badly-written role ) uses his own savings to help Toby get out of trouble . Yes , circus performers always have lots of money saved up . The movie gets even less plausible ( and more offensive ) when Toby gets locked in the lion's cage . The beast lumbers towards him on all fours . . . and turns out to be an African-American man wearing a lion's skin and head ( with ' yassuh ' dialogue in the intertitles ) . Turns out that the lion died , so they offered the job to Old Black Joe . The bareback rider in the circus is pretty Jeannette , a girl about Toby's age ( played by an actress rather older ) . Toby's carelessness causes an accident in which Jeannette sprains her ankle , and she can't perform . No problem : the circus crew dress up Toby as a girl , and they train him to do Jeannette's riding act . ( With some very obvious stunt doubling . ) There's a very sick-making moment here when Luigi the clown kisses Toby . It's bad enough that a man is kissing a boy , but the boy is dressed as a girl and the man is costumed as a clown . I couldn't help thinking of a certain gay serial killer who wore a clown costume . Ugh ! In the original novel , Toby Tyler did indeed become a bareback rider . . . a male equestrian , under the name Monsieur Ajax . The Disney film applied that name to a character not present in the novel : a boy equestrian who was Toby's rival . The female impersonation angle was devised for this Jackie Coogan movie , and is blessedly absent from the novel and Disney's remake . Was someone trying to groom Jackie Coogan for a career as a drag performer ? Shortly after ' Circus Days ' , he starred in ' A Boy of Flanders ' , which also has a long sequence featuring Jackie passing as a girl in public . ' Circus Days ' is well directed by Edward Cline , and has some good performances and photography . But Disney's version ( for all its changes ) is far more faithful to the original novel . I'll rate ' Circus Days ' .
Tryon tries it on ; Bara barely seen .	' 45 Minutes from Hollywood ' is sometimes cited in filmographies as Theda Bara's last movie . When her deadly-earnest vamp roles fell out of fashion , Bara signed a multi-film contract with Hal Roach to guy her previous screen image in lowbrow comedies . . . but made only one film , ' Madame Mystery ' . Since Bara didn't need the money , she gave quits right there . Roach inserted a brief out-take from ' Madame Mystery ' into ' 45 Minutes ' , oddly showing Bara indoors during an exterior sequence . There's also a clip of Our Gang from their recent ' Thundering Fleas ' . The title parodies " Forty-Five Minutes from Broadway " , a 1906 musical ( and song ) by George M Cohan , and the premise of ' 45 Minutes from Hollywood ' - - country boy goes to the city - - is arguably a reversal of Cohan's show . Gormless hick Orville ( Glenn Tryon ) has to deliver a wad of cash to an office in the big city . . . but that city is Hollywood , so Orville's elderly dad and his pretty sister want to tag along . As the sister , Molly O'Day gamely joins into the slapstick pratfalls . In the big city , Orville gets mixed up with a woman bank thief . . . but when I saw her running down an alley , I rumbled that she was no woman . Sure enough : this ' woman ' ( played by an unbilled male actor who's extremely credible in female guise ) lures Orville into a hotel room , one jump ahead of the cops . For some reason , the faux female pretends to swoon into Orville's arms . . . which ought to tip him off that this woman is heavy enough to be a man . Then she knocks him out , intending to make a getaway in his clothes . The wad of banknotes in Orville's suit turns out to be a bonus . So far , so plausible : there are many real-life accounts of male bank robbers using female disguise . But for some stupid reason , the bank robber hangs about long enough to put his own female disguise ( including cloche hat , earrings , stockings , undergarments and shoes ) onto Orville . When Orville wakes up , he discovers he's a wanted ' woman ' . . . and the cops don't believe him when he claims otherwise . This sort of comedy is just barely plausible in silent films , since the actor's unheard voice doesn't give away his gender . In a talkie , this wouldn't have worked at all . Earlier , there's a title card acknowledging that the ' female ' bank robber sounds like a man . For modern viewers , this film will be of greatest interest because of separate performances by Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy , pre-team . Laurel briefly mugs as an unemployed actor . In a ( literally ) much larger role is burly Hardy as the apoplectic house detective , galumphing through the lobby in a towel . Hardy's good , but his big scene is an implausible sequence relying on very poor animation , when Hardy shares his towel with a ( very obviously cartoon ) mouse and cat . Elsewhere , Hardy does one hugely impressive face-first pratfall - - nobody in this movie was stunt-doubled , so far as I could tell - - and there are some ludicrous gags involving a fire extinguisher . A photo caption expects us to believe that Vivien Oakland ( a Hal Roach contract player ) lives in a $250 million ( ! ) mansion . Earlier , I was intrigued by a close shot played against a chequerwork tablecloth : interesting Pop Art effect in black and white . There's some funny stuff in ' 45 Minutes from Hollywood ' , but it's too bad they didn't credit that actor who portrayed the cross-dressing thief . My rating for this one : .
Virginia ham and Mayo	Virginia Mayo is largely associated with lightweight Danny Kaye movies and occasional dramatic roles ( ' White Heat ' and ' The Best Years of Our Lives ' ) . " She's Back on Broadway " is an attempt to star Ms Mayo in a musical with some real substance to it . This movie fails at most of what it sets out to do , but it's an interesting failure with some genuine merit and some good performances . Several months before starring in " She's Back on Broadway " , Virginia Mayo starred in another Warners film which is better than this one : " She's Working Her Way Through College " . These two films are not related , but their similar titles and similarity of tone suggest that somebody at Warners was trying to exercise an overall strategy for Mayo's film career . In " She's Back on Broadway " , Mayo plays Catherine Terriss , a Hollywood actress who starred in several movies a while back , but whose film career is now idling . ( Ironically , Mayo herself was never as great a star as the character she plays here ! ) The opening scene grabs our attention , and promises that this will be no typical frothy musical . Catherine is sitting at the pool of her movie-star mansion , reading a newspaper headline about another film actress who has just committed suicide . The other actress was only slightly older than Catherine , with a similar career arc : Catherine tells her manager ( the excellent Larry Keating ) that she's afraid she'll land up the same way . Desperate to give her career a jolt , she quits Hollywood and returns to where she started : Broadway . Using her own savings , she bankrolls a stage musical and hires big-deal director Rick Sommers to direct it . Sommers is played by Steve Cochran , an underrated actor who never got the career he deserved . . . possibly because Cochran had leading-man looks but his talents were geared more towards character roles . He gives a fine performance in this movie as the dynamic Broadway director , but Cochran is lumbered with some gimmicky dialogue . After giving his cast a spirited pep-talk , he abruptly relaxes and tells them something which contradicts everything he's already said : ' You'll find we're very easily satisfied . . . ' Then , before this can sink in , he straight away changes mood again and barks : ' . . . with perfection ! And nothing less ! ' Gene Nelson ( an ingratiating song-and-dance man whose gymnastic talents were never properly utilised ) auditions for a role in the show . He barely sings four bars before Cochran tells him to come back tomorrow ' . . . and bring a pen ' . There's an annoying and unfunny running gag about a pawky and untalented young man who auditions as a bass singer , as a baritone , as a tenor . . . until Cochran finally casts him in a non-speaking part so he won't show up at the audition for sopranos ! I found all of the audition and rehearsal sequences in this film extremely unrealistic . The problem with " She's Back on Broadway " is that its plot isn't gripping enough to succeed as straight drama , and its songs aren't tuneful enough for this to be more than a sub-average musical . All of the songs are dull and unmemorable . Gene Nelson never gets a chance to cut loose with the spectacular acrobatics he displayed in other films . ( I still savour the incredible standing back salto he performed in ' Tea for Two ' , with its Olympic-class amplitude . ) The ' best ' song here ( not saying much ) is ' Breakfast in Bed ' , a tinkly little ditty performed by Mayo in a ludicrous costume . Steve Condos , formerly of the Condos Brothers , does a jazzy dance number that has him bojangling his way up and down a tiny plywood staircase . SPOILERS ? ? ? COMING . We get a lot of turgid dialogue here about how everybody's career is at stake , and everybody is taking huge risks . . . but it's absolutely no surprise at all that the Broadway show is ( of course ) a huge hit . " She's Back on Broadway " keeps threatening to be something much more substantial than just another let's-put-on-a-show story , but never lives up to the promise of that starkly dramatic first scene . This film is a pleasant time-passer with glimpses of greatness . I'll rate " She's Back on Broadway " .
Don't blow those ashes over here . . .	Stoopnagle and Budd were a comedy team in 1930s American radio . They weren't a cross-talk act , because Budd Hulick was strictly the ' straight man ' and feed , while Colonel Lemuel Q . Stoopnagle got the laughs . . . if there were any . Despite his elaborate name , Colonel Lemuel Q . Stoopnagle was ( in the team's very occasional film appearances ) a conventional-looking man in a business suit . His real name was Frederick Chase Taylor , and he was a cousin of H . P . Lovecraft ( ! ) , no less . Budd looked conventional too , being slightly smaller than Stoopnagle but also wearing a suit and a trilby . They were , after all , radio comedians who didn't rely on their looks . On his own , Stoopnagle would tell conventional fairy tales but would embellish them with spoonerisms about the ' dappy dappy hays ' . In the story of the Three Little Pigs , Stoopnagle would relate how the wolf ' blew the smith to house-ereens ' . Then he would explain how Cinderella ' slopped her dripper ' . Stoopnagle's fairy-tale routines were later recycled wholesale by Grand Ole Opry ( and ' Hee Haw ' ) comedian Archie Campbell . Stoopnagle would occasionally conscript Budd into his tongue-twisting tales , such as the one about Phoebe B . Beebee and her new canoe canal in Saugatuck , near Naugatuck , Connecticut . Most of the Stoopnagle and Budd routines consisted of Budd interviewing Stoopnagle about his latest inventions . This format was similar to the one later used on ' Your Show of Shows ' , in which Carl Reiner ( playing a reporter ) would interview Sid Caesar ( playing a professor ) who was allegedly an expert on some subject . Stoopnagle's inventions were , of course , completely useless . My favourite was his goldfish bowl lined with picture postcards . . . so the goldfish swimming inside the bowl will think it's going someplace . ' Stoopnocracy ' was one of the Screen Songs shorts produced by the Fleischer animation studio and released through Paramount . Each Screen Song began and ended with an animation sequence , sandwiching the live-action sequence ( and a sing-along ) by a popular showbiz act of the time . The Screen Songs printed the lyric on the screen ( in white ) so that the audience in the cinema could sing along , with a bouncing ball so that the audience wouldn't lose their place . Here , we get some amusing gags featuring a ' Funny Farm ' ( madhouse ) which sends out a lorry ( driven by cartoon animals ) to grab other cartoon animals who are acting crazy , and to haul them off to the loony-bin . There's one outrageous racial gag : we see a smiley-face sun in the sky ( like the one in ' Roger Rabbit ' ) . A cat with a spring-loaded tail splatters black paint on the sun , leaving the sun wearing blackface ! The sun even says " Mammy ! " . Cue the live-action sequence . Budd interviews Stoopnagle about his latest inventions , which include some spherical dice ( for people who'd rather play marbles ) and an ashtray that never wants cleaning because it's attached to an electric fan ( which blows away the ashes ) . The sing-along sequence of this Screen Song instalment surprised me , since Budd was always subordinate to Stoopnagle in the act . . . but here he gets to lead the sing-along . Stoopnagle's latest invention is ' a Bing Crosby cigar ' : anyone who smokes it will sound like Bing Crosby . Budd promptly lights it , and then proceeds to lip-synch Der Bingle's voice singing ' Please ' . This idea was funnier when Paramount recycled it 12 years later in ' Out of this World ' , an Eddie Bracken movie . So far , ' Stoopnocracy ' has been clever and funny , but now it just gets dumb and racist . In a jump cut , Stoopnagle magically produces a ' baby ' in the form of a Negro boy ( about nine years old ) dressed in baby clothes , who proceeds to lip-synch Cab Calloway's rendition of ' Minnie the Moocher ' while the bouncing ball bounces the lyric . I've seen quite a few of these bouncing-ball sing-alongs , but this is the only one I've seen featuring a song with a scat lyric . Several times , the bouncing ball seemed to lose its place among the scat syllables , and I couldn't blame it . Matters are not helped when the scat lyrics ( printed in white ) get lost in the white folds of the black boy's baby costume . From here , we go back to the Fleischer animation , and a couple of amusing gags about " chest-nuts " ( hitting each other in the chest ) and " wall-nuts " ( climbing the walls ) . ' Stoopnocracy ' would have been a lot funnier if they'd left out that black kid . Normally , when a showbiz act from the stage or from radio makes a rare film appearance , I'm willing to add a couple of points to my rating of that film for its historical value . The film appearances of Stoopnagle and Budd are very rare indeed , but Stoopnagle and Budd weren't a very important act anyway . I'll rate this one only .
The guest is a ghost , and the host is aghast	Greetings to Barbara Siek and everyone else in the Dirk Bogarde chat group . The 1966 television production of ' Blithe Spirit ' suffers in comparison to David Lean's film version , but on its own merits it's an enjoyable drawing-room comedy with a supernatural theme . During World War Two , there was an increase in plays and films dealing with life after death , and ghosts ; these tended to be comedies or light dramas with happy endings , rather than spooky horror stories . As the war's death tolls rose , audiences wanted to be assured that there is indeed an afterlife , and that it's a nice place to go . Noël Coward wrote ' Blithe Spirit ' in a single week ( ! ) while staying in one of the guest cottages at the Hotel Portmeirion , a remarkable seaside resort in Gwynedd , North Wales . Portmeirion is now well-known as the resort which was used as the Village in the 1960s tv series ' The Prisoner ' . But for many decades , Portmeirion attracted prominent authors and intellectuals from Britain and America , who wrote some of their best works in the bracing air and enchanting vistas of this unusual village . In this tv production , Dirk Bogarde stars as Charles Condomine , a successful novelist now married to sensible Ruth following the death of his headstrong and eccentric first wife Elvira . Charles has no truck with any supernatural nonsense , but he's currently working on a novel that has supernatural themes . Accordingly , he's decided to engage a medium to hold a seance in his drawing-room . . . strictly as research for his novel , of course . SPOILERS COMING . The seance has unexpected results , when clairvoyant Madame Arcati manages to summon the ghost of Elvira . . . who straight away begins taunting , daunting and haunting her husband Charles as if she had never left . Things are made worse for Charles ( and funnier for us ) because he's the only one who can see and hear Elvira . Eventually , Elvira nobbles the brakes on Charles's car , hoping to kill him so they can be reunited in the afterworld . But Elvira's scheme kills Ruth instead . . . and now Charles has two ghostly wives tormenting him ! Although filmed on a low budget with static camera work , this production of ' Blithe Spirit ' is a delight , featuring some deft performances and ( with one exception ) some splendid casting . In the central role , Dirk Bogarde is properly dashing and urbane . He's quite funny as he betrays his helpless bafflement at being haunted by one ghostly wife , and then two . In a couple of scenes , Bogarde seems just slightly effeminate . . . but he can't possibly be any worse in this respect than Clifton Webb , who played the same role when ' Blithe Spirit ' ran on Broadway . Rosemary Harris usually strikes me as colourless , but in this case it's intentional and she turns it to her advantage . As the ghostly Elvira , Ms Harris plays her role in grey sackcloth and sandals . She's quite convincingly inhuman , a spectre who clearly relishes her unearthliness . Ms Harris is a delight as she casually drops the names of several famous dead people who are now her ghostly neighbours . Second wife Ruth is played by Rachel Roberts : an odd casting choice , as Roberts was at this time married to Rex Harrison , who played Charles Condomine in the earlier ( and much better ) film of ' Blithe Spirit ' . Roberts's presence here only calls attention to the previous film . I've never been impressed with Rachel Roberts as an actress . Here , however , her mannered tics and crotchets are less obtrusive than usual . . . and Ms Roberts looks slightly more attractive than usual , so long as she keeps her face towards the camera . When she turns in profile , we see that bizarrely upturned nose of hers , which looks as if it's been caught in a skyhook . Interestingly , Roberts gives a much better performance in the third act ( as the ghostly Ruth , taunting her husband after her death ) than she does in the first act , as the live Ruth who can't figure out why her husband is acting so strangely . The only fly in the ectoplasm is the utterly untalented Ruth Gordon as the medium who causes all the problems . I have never found Ruth Gordon remotely funny in any of her roles . ( I especially loathed her in ' Harold and Maude ' . ) As the flamboyant Madame Arcati here , Gordon is aware that she is giving a ' performance ' as a ' character ' , and so she's mannered accordingly . Gordon does that annoying little mouth twitch of hers , that she seems to feel is an adequate substitute for constructing a plausible characterisation . Mme Arcati commutes to her seances via bicycle : I shouldn't mind getting a glimpse of Ruth Gordon riding a bike ( especially if she falls off ) , but here she makes her exits and entrances on foot , trundling the bicycle alongside while she speaks a few lines about riding through the forest . The bike is nothing more than an unwieldy prop , to match Ruth Gordon's unwieldy performance . I would like to have seen Bea Lillie's performance as Arcati in ' High Spirits ' , the Broadway musical version of this material . In fact , I vaguely recall another tv version of ' Blithe Spirit ' , in which Hattie Jacques was hilarious in the same role that Ruth Gordon handles so badly here . Just the idea of Hattie Jacques on a bicycle gets me laughing . This tv version of ' Blithe Spirit ' is enjoyable , but it's a pale wraith alongside the film version starring Rex Harrison and Margaret Rutherford . Also , Coward's script has been somewhat truncated in order to fit into the television format . I'll rate this tv production , and I recommend that you get a video of the Rex Harrison movie instead .
Pain , pin , pun : Sharp's the word .	The single cleverest thing about this early short film is its French title , which unfortunately doesn't work nearly so well in English . ' La Peine du Talion ' would translate roughly as ' The Point of Law ' . . . which ( because of this story , involving a sharp pin ) is a play on the word ' point ' , and which is also a pun . . . because ' Peine ' in French also means ' pain ' . So , this film's title actually has three different meanings ! We see a rather ridiculous-looking hobbyist in a grotesque set of plus-fours and matching jacket : he looks like an overfed version of Mel Brooks in a bad toupee . His hobby is butterflies : we see him carefully piercing each specimen with a pin and affixing it to his album . That is , until some enormous butterflies put a pin through the hobbyist ( at a spot just slightly north of his navel ) , after which the butterflies celebrate their victory . This movie is very crude even for its time . . . which actually works in its favour , since the plight of the human protagonist - - impaled on an enormous pin - - is staged in such a phony-looking manner that it's funny rather than distressing . ( There's no bloodshed . ) However , the enormous butterflies are somewhat distressing , and not very convincing with it . Still , science-fiction historians might want to note that this is ( to my knowledge ) the first giant-insect movie . This brief comedy reminded me of those EC comic books from the 1950s - - ' Tales of the Crypt ' and so forth - - in which some hapless protagonist would suffer a tit-for-tat fate reflecting his own behaviour . . . for instance , a space traveller who kills a daisy by playing " she loves me not " with it , plucking its petals off one by one , is captured by a botanical alien organism that proceeds to pull off his limbs in an equivalent ritual . Here , a man who pins butterflies to a sheet of paper is pinned in turn by bigger butterflies . Crude but amusing . I'll rate this movie , mostly for its very clever title .
No talking in the library	' The Thief ' is a gimmick film , and the gimmick is more interesting than the film itself . Without the gimmick , this movie is a fairly banal Cold War drama . The central character is an American nuclear physicist ( played by Ray Milland ) who , at regular intervals , gives classified information to spies for a foreign power . ( The enemy nation is never identified , but surely it's either the Soviet Union or a Soviet satellite nation acting as intermediary for the Kremlin . ) Eventually the physicist's guilt and his latent patriotism overcome his other motivations , and he turns himself in . The gimmick is that this feature-length film tells its story without any dialogue . I've seen at least one reference book which lists ' The Thief ' as a silent film . That's incorrect ; ' The Thief ' has a soundtrack , with conventional ambient sound throughout the film , and occasional human noises such as grunts and screams . . . but no coherent dialogue . The gimmick is an interesting one , but it becomes wearying . On at least three occasions in this movie , Milland's character is home alone when his contact man rings him up . We see Milland staring in horror at the ' phone as it rings . And it rings . And it rings some more . Once we realise that there's never going to be any dialogue in this movie , we also realise that Milland isn't going to pick up the ' phone . It's not quite clear what's happening here . Is Milland allowing the ' phone to ring , unanswered , because the number of rings constitutes some sort of signal between Milland and his contact man ? Or is Milland supposed to answer the ' phone , but he's too gutless to pick it up ? Anyway , each time the ring-ring routine commences , it always ends the same way : eventually the scene fades out ( with the ' phone still ringing ) , and then we fade in to Milland on his way to the next rendezvous . At several other points in the film , the narrative gets bent out of shape to enable the action to proceed without dialogue , in a situation where plausibility makes dialogue essential . ( By the way , I really dislike any movie in which a ' phone keeps ringing or a baby keeps crying , and we're forced to listen to this because nobody on screen responds to the situation . ) ' The Thief ' benefits from some extremely realistic locations , notably in one sequence in which Milland drops off his microfilm by sticking it in a drawer of a card catalogue in a reference library . Dozens of people are present , and none of them notice what he's doing . ( Also , the hushed atmosphere of the library makes the movie's no-dialogue gimmick - in this particular scene , at least - very plausible . ) The contact man in this scene is played by Martin Gabel , an American actor who affected a crisp mid-Atlantic accent ; it's interesting to see Gabel here in a role that doesn't rely on his distinctive speaking voice . There's also a suspenseful sequence in which Milland must climb an outdoor stairway to deal with a ' tail ' who's been surveilling him . On the negative side of the ledger , we get that old atom-bomb cliché which has afflicted other movies better than this one , including ' Torn Curtain ' and ' Pickup on South Street ' : namely , that a mathematical formula is somehow so powerful that spies will want to steal it . That's nonsense , that is . The atomic-bomb secrets which were bandied about by Rudolf Abel and Julius Rosenberg were specific engineering schematics of military ordnance . In ' The Thief ' , Milland is just peddling algebraic equations . . . and we're expected to believe that these fiddly bits of maths can somehow change the balance of power . The basic implausibility of this film's premise , strained even farther by the no-talking gimmick , is made a lot more bearable by the documentary-style cinema-verite techniques used throughout . Not one shot in this film looks like a studio set-up . At one point , one of Milland's contacts ( who has just picked up the latest microfilm ) steps into a crossing and blunders into the path of an uncoming vehicle . A woman pedestrian sees this , and she reacts . Because of the no-dialogue gimmick , which makes this seem like a silent film with dubbed-in sound effects , I expected her to react silently . Impressively , she screams ; the movie would have lost all remaining plausibility had she not done so . Ray Milland ( a seriously underrated actor , despite his Oscar ) gives a strong performance in a role which allows him only a very limited emotional range and no dialogue at all . ' The Thief ' would have been much more plausible if it had skipped the no-dialogue gimmick and told this movie conventionally . But without the gimmick , this would be a much less interesting film : the gimmick is much more compelling than anything else that's on offer here . I'll rate ' The Thief ' .
The animation is better than the gags .	This is basically a ' Baby Herman ' movie : a baby keeps obliviously wandering into perilous situations , and then just as obliviously wandering out of them again . . . while the frantic guardian , all too aware of the danger , keeps getting hurt . But at least this cartoon gives Popeye a change from his usual formula of trading punches with Bluto or some other menace . Is Swee'Pea meant to be Olive Oyl's nephew , or is he her illegitimate son ? Whatever he is , Olive dumps him on Popeye for the day . Popeye dumps Swee'Pea into the pram , and heads for the zoo . There's some nice multiplane animation during the trip to the zoo , and the sequence with the cartoon elephant seems to contain some rotoscoped footage of a live-action elephant . Most of the gags are quite obvious . At one point , Swee'Pea rides bareback astride a leopard while the soundtrack plays ' Hold that Tiger ' . Given that choice of music , why didn't the animators put Swee'Pea on a tiger instead of a leopard ? I suspected that there was some gag coming up involving the leopard's spots , which wouldn't work as well with a tiger's stripes . Sure enough . I dislike movies about babies , and I like cartoon babies even less . Popeye is funnier without Swee'Pea , and it's unfortunate that Olive's role in this toon is so brief that it gives her nothing to do . More for the impressive animation than anything else , I'll rate this . The Fleischer Studio's cartoons were released through Paramount . After they lost Fleischer , the cartoons produced by Paramount's in-studio animation unit were consistently the worst animation output by any major Hollywood studio . Even the worst Fleischer Popeye cartoon is far better than any of the post-Fleischer Popeyes .
Barmy in the army	Dane and Arthur were not one of the all-time great comedy teams , but there was one unusual aspect of their teamwork . In most comedy teams , the comedians play allies . . . but Dane and Arthur sometimes played adversaries at cross purposes , with Karl Dane as the authority figure and George K . Arthur as the anti-authority figure . For example , in " Brotherly Love " ( a comedy set largely in prison ) , Dane plays the dim-witted warder whilst Arthur plays the clever convict who keeps foxing him . A similar structure prevails in " Rookies " , which is probably the funniest Dane and Arthur film . . . and that's not saying much . Greg Lee ( Arthur ) is a conceited cabaret dancer who gets conscripted into the army . Dane plays Sergeant Diggs , the gruff drill instructor . Dane's role is a cliché , and he plays it that way . Both men are attracted to the same girl , blandly played by Marceline Day . So far this movie seems to be a bad parody of " Tell It to the Marines " , which features a character named Sergeant JIGGS ( the Marine mascot ) . " Tell It to the Marines " was a box-office smash at the time that " Rookies " went into production . Hmmm . . . Privately , Private Lee doesn't enjoy army life , so he does everything possible to get digs at Diggs by annoying the sergeant and undermining his authority . In the real world ( or in a plausible movie ) , this would get Lee sent to the stockade . OBVIOUS SPOILER NOW . Eventually , Lee buckles down and becomes a dedicated soldier . . . at first he does this to please Betty ( Marceline ) but eventually the esprit de corps gets to him and he genuinely wants to be a good soldier . The airborne climax of the film is genuinely exciting , when Private Lee jumps out of an aeroplane in midair to rescue the passengers of a runaway balloon . Much of this sequence is very obviously faked , but it's well-paced and exciting anyway . The title cards in this film are full of slangy wisecracks , and the sets ( in the army camp ) are unconvincing : I shan't make any jokes about esprit decor . The funniest scene is a drill routine , which may have inspired similar scenes in " Buck Privates " and many another army comedy . While drilling a row of squaddies , Sergeant Diggs takes one man's rifle and demonstrates a ( very impressive ) manual of arms . . . then he hurls it back at the recruit while barking " Now do what I just did ! " Of course , all the squaddies hurl their rifles at the sergeant ! I saw this gag coming from a mile away , but it's still funny . I'll rate " Rookies " . The individual story incidents aren't much like the ones in " Tell It to the Marines " , but the basic premise and the characters ' arcs are much too similar . Stand easy , lads .
All about Bacall	' Applause ' was a Broadway musical based on the cult movie ' All About Eve ' , but it differs significantly from that film . After Lauren Bacall starred as Margo Channing in ' Applause ' on Broadway , she repeated her starring role in the West End production of that show in London . In one of the most ironic casting choices in history , Bacall was replaced in the Broadway cast by Anne Baxter . In the film ' All About Eve ' , Baxter had played Eve Harrington , the would-be actress who schemed to take over Margo Channing's life . In the cast of ' Applause ' , Baxter finally got that chance . ' All About Eve ' and ' Applause ' were indirectly based on a true incident in the career of European actress Elisabeth Bergner . Screenwriter Joseph L Mankiewicz borrowed the name ' Eve Harrington ' from the Preston Sturges film ' The Lady Eve ' , in which a scheming woman named Harrington uses ' Eve ' as her criminal alias . I was peripherally involved in the London production of ' Applause ' , as a minor staffer in the producer's office . In 1973 , I hadn't yet seen the film ' All About Eve ' , and I couldn't understand why there was so much fuss over this movie . One of the songs in ' Applause ' is called ' Fasten Your Seat Belts ( It's going to be a bumpy night ) ' , but the song is performed at a party and has nothing to do with air travel . I didn't understand at the time that this song was inspired by a famous line in the original film . ' All About Eve ' begins with a ceremony for the Sarah Siddons Award . This was ( at the time ) a fictional award named for a real stage actress ; following the film's success , there is now a genuine Sarah Siddons Award . For the Broadway and London stage productions of ' Applause ' ( and this TV version ) , the trophy was changed to the Tony Award , with permission from the American Theatre Wing ( who give out the real Tony Awards ) . In the opening scene of the stage musical , there was an awkward tech cue as we hear the thoughts of famed actress Margo Channing ( Bacall ) in pre-recorded voice-over . This was done much more easily in the TV version . Bacall waves a Tony Award overhead , wearing a sleeveless gown that gives us a full view of her shaved armpits . The camera shifts into slo-mo , to make sure we don't miss those armpits . She then goes to a party where the guests engage in peculiar scat-singing . ( ' Ba-ba-bee-ba ! ' ) ' Applause ' is notable for having a script by Broadway veterans Betty Comden and Adolph Green but songs by Lee Adams and Charles Strouse , the team best known for the score of ' Bye Bye Birdie ' . Comden and Green usually wrote the lyrics for their scripts ; for ' Applause ' , they were brought into the project after Adams and Strouse had written a score . What is it about gay men and aging actresses ? For reasons that elude me , the movie ' All About Eve ' is some sort of gay rite of passage . The musicals of Comden and Green contain large amounts of material that's gay-friendly , but not explicitly so . ' Applause ' is the exception . With its background of Broadway musicals , the gay aspects of the New York theatre get far more than a look-in here . In the original film , Margo Channing's dresser was an older woman ; in ' Applause ' , this character is a handsome young man named Duane Fox . She invites him to escort her to an after-theatre party . When Duane demurs that he's got a date , Bacall theatrically tosses her long tawny hair and says ' Bring him along ! ' . The most bizarre scene in this TV special occurs when gayboy Duane brings Margo to his favourite bar in Greenwich Village , where lots of good-looking young men want to meet this aging actress . ( Not another woman is in sight ; I guess none of these guys can get a girlfriend . ) Bacall performs a musical number in front of a wall of multi-coloured neon lights , each light forming a letter of the alphabet . These letters appear to be randomly scattered across the wall , but if you follow them in a knight's tour they spell out " GAY POWER " , with one extra letter as a decoy . As Margo leaves , a young man named Danny shouts : ' I love her ! ' A far more enjoyable number is the title song , performed by would-be actors who work as waiters and waitresses at Joe Allen's . ( In the 1970s , this was a real restaurant in the Broadway theatre district , noted for its distinctive red and white tablecloths . ) For Bacall's pleasure , all the boys and girls at Joe Allen's perform an elaborate dance number referencing other Broadway musicals , ranging from ' Oklahoma ! ' to ' Oh Calcutta ! ' . There's some contrived dialogue here that wasn't in the movie . When Karen Richards feels guilt for draining the gas tank of Margo's car , she imagines she hears comments about this . ( " You're a gas ! " " T'anks ! " ) More enjoyable is a scene that wasn't in ' All About Eve ' , with Karen and her husband Buzz ( named ' Lloyd ' in the movie ) attending a party . All the guests wear signs on their backs , with each sign bearing the name of a famous person . Since no guest can read his own sign , they must respond to clues from other guests to learn who they are . ' Applause ' is a good ( but not great ) musical , adapted from a movie that worked better as a film . The best elements here are direct references to Broadway's theatre community that weren't in the film , such as the gypsy-robe scene and the gay subculture . But ' Applause ' can never be revived except as a period piece , since it makes absolutely no mention of Aids . I'll rate this enjoyable TV version , and I wish someone would explain to me why gay men are so fascinated by aging actresses .
Jangle in the jungle .	Here we have a mid-level Heckle and Jeckle cartoon : not one of their best , but nor one of their worst . The magpies decide to stow away aboard a luxury flight to Africa , and of course mayhem ensues . What I found most interesting about this 1949 toon is its post-war depiction of luxury air travel . There's one shot of a HUGE aircraft , with several gangways of passengers boarding it . Luxury meals are served in-flight by a gourmet chef ( Dimwit the hound , no less ) , and the interior of the ' plane looks like an hotel . I was impressed by an unusually elaborate ( by Terrytoon standards ) animation sequence of the magpies inside the aircraft's fuel lines and engines . As for the flight's destination : oh , dear . There's no particular reason why this flight has to be bound for Africa rather than somewhere else . However , the cartoon opens with a shot of a stereotypical African native ( bone in his hair , ring in his nose ) , and ( SPOILERS COMING ) it ends with some similar racial stereotypes dancing round a boiling cauldron while the magpies simmer within it . Since ' The Stowaways ' is a cartoon , you're probably less interested in social commentary or analysis than in whether or not the darned thing is funny . Answer : yes , it is , but this isn't one of their funniest . However , it's nice to see Jeckle get the last word over Heckle for once , rather than the more usual other way round . My rating : .
Rare glimpse of Clayton , Jackson & Durante	' Roadhouse Nights ' is supposedly based on a novel by Dashiell Hammett which I haven't read , but I suspect that this movie varies hugely from the source material . The most interesting thing about this movie is that it contains some performance footage of Clayton , Jackson and Durante . . . who were headliners in vaudeville before Jimmy Durante's solo stardom . Bud Clayton and Eddie Jackson were Jimmy Durante's vaudeville partners . During Prohibition , before Jimmy Durante became a Broadway star , the three of them performed in Manhattan's swank Club Durant , a night spot which was supposedly owned by Jimmy Durante , but which was actually financed by gangster money . ( The club was named ' Durant ' , not ' Durante ' : Jimmy Durante claimed this was because he couldn't afford a final ' E ' for the sign ! ) Bud Clayton was a nimble tap-dancer who actually looked like a slightly uglier and darker version of Jimmy Durante . Clayton left the act early , but continued to work as Durante's manager . Eddie Jackson was an Irish-style tenor who did strutting high-kicks while he sang . Following Clayton's retirement , Jackson and Durante continued to work as a two-act for a while . . . teaming for comedy duets such as the hilarious ' Go On Home , Your Mother's Calling ' . Throughout Durante's solo stardom , Jackson occasionally made appearances with him ( on the Ed Sullivan Show , among other gigs ) . ' Roadhouse Nights ' preserves a rare glimpse of Clayton , Jackson and Durante's nightclub act from their Club Durant days : fast-paced anarchic comedy , with up-tempo music . The plot of this movie is a whole other problem . I strongly suspect that the plot line of Hammett's novel was reworked in order to supply a vehicle for Charles Ruggles , a grossly unfunny comedian who was unaccountably popular in the 1930s . Jim Hanson is a crusading Chicago reporter , risking his life to get the goods on Prohibition bootlegger Sam Horner . ( Hanson is played by an actor named Joe King , who probably spent his entire career enduring wisecracks like ' You must be Joe King ! ' ) Phoning a scoop to his city editor , Hanson reports that Horner gets his illegal booze from a corrupt police chief in a ( fictional ) suburb of Cook County . Suddenly , the line goes dead . . . and so does Hanson . Horner killed him . The city editor assigns another reporter ( played by Charles Ruggles ) to get the goods on Horner and his gang . Ruggles's character is named Bindbugel : a really annoying name that tips the audience he's supposed to be funny . Ruggles turns in a performance that's meant to be serio-comic , but which I found mostly annoying . SPOILERS COMING . Horner's moll is a tough gal named Lola , played by blues crooner Helen Morgan . ( Don't expect much singing from her here . ) By an amazing coincidence , Lola was Bindbugel's sweetheart back in high school . She helps him infiltrate Horner's gang . When Bindbugel's incompetence blows his cover , Horner draws his gun and prepares to shoot Bindbugel . There's a gunshot . . . and Horner falls dead . Lola shot him . Charles Ruggles ruins every movie he's in . This movie would have worked better as a straight noir drama , even though the rules of noir cinema were still gestating at this early date . Ruggles does provide a deft performance in one scene , at a bank of coin phones in a roadhouse . He manages to get away from Horner's gang for a few minutes , and he tries to phone the copy desk at his newspaper . Just as the call goes through , Horner catches up with him . Quickly , Ruggles grabs the receiver from the phone in the next stall . With the crooks watching him , Ruggles loudly babbles a banal message into the second phone ( which isn't connected to an outside line ) whilst he surreptitiously taps a Morse message into the first ' phone . ( I hope the copy desk can decode Morse . ) This scene is genuinely suspenseful and funny , both at once , and it racks up the tension a notch . I wish that the whole movie could have been like this . As it is , I'll rate this movie only . . . mostly for Clayton , Jackson and Durante .
Funnier than I'd expected .	One of the tragedies of the first World War - - the bloodiest war in history , up till that time - - was that thousands of the men who'd survived through the Armistice came home to discover that their civilian jobs were no longer open , and other jobs were not easy to find . ' Smithy ' is a comedy - - a fairly lowbrow one , at that - - yet it touches upon that real and tragic situation . There's a dialogue exchange here which was probably meant as comedy , yet which I found genuinely poignant . When former doughboy Smithy ( Stan Laurel ) applies for work on a construction crew , the foreman asks ' Are you an ex-soldier ? ' . . . to which Laurel replies ' For the rest of my life . ' The film starts with Smithy in the 372nd Infantry of the A . E . F . I'd expected some routine army gags , but I sat up and took notice when I saw that Stan Laurel's sergeant is played by the brilliant James Finlayson . I was all set for some of that legendary interplay between ' Fin ' and Stan - - surely worth seeing even without ' Babe ' Hardy to complete the formula - - but , alas , it doesn't happen . Finlayson is little more than a straight man here . A few years ago , while attending a performance of Alan Ayckbourn's play ' Comic Potential ' in London , I was delightfully surprised by a line of dialogue paying tribute to the great Jimmy Finlayson : too bad that ' Smithy ' wastes his talents . Charlie Hall , who also wreaked comedy mayhem in several Laurel & Hardy movies , is here too but likewise wasted . Cut to a scene in the construction company's office , where the very handsome Glenn Tryon plays an executive named Smith . We know instantly what's going to happen : the workers receive orders that Mr Smith is to take over the construction project , and of course they think this means Smithy : the gormless naff played here by Laurel . Sure enough . From here it's strictly by-the-numbers house-building slapstick , of the type which was perfected by vaudevillains Willie , West & McGinty . Laurel has one clever bit of physical comedy when he walks along the building site with a long plank of timber balanced on his head , extending fore and aft : when he suddenly does a volte-face and walks back the other way , the plank maintains its orientation instead of turning with him . Doesn't sound funny , but it's hilarious . I also laughed at one amusing gag performed by Laurel astride a ladder while carrying a roll of tar-paper . Amazingly and unexpectedly , the crew under Laurel's supervision actually get the house built . I was expecting it to be a crazy-quilt construction like the house Buster Keaton built in ' One Week ' . . . but Smithy and his work gang get the job done , to order . When the ' real ' Mr Smith shows up , Smithy's loyal workers point out that the ' wrong ' Smith still deserves credit for a job well done . . . and then comes the final gag . I was expecting something here , but the visual punchline - - a surprisingly elaborate and expensive gag in this low-budget comedy - - was totally unexpected , and therefore hilarious . I'll rate ' Smithy ' . It feels as if it's meant to be the first instalment in a series of comedies starring Laurel as this character : in the event , it was a one-off . Stan was good here , but he never truly became a first-rate screen comedian until he shared the screen with Oliver Hardy .
She's Russian , he's rushin ' .	Once again , a ' lost ' film turns out merely to have been mislaid . Bill Wellman's ' You Never Know Women ' was ' lost ' for decades , until a print surfaced in the Library of Congress . . . one of the two most obvious places to look for it ! ( The other being AMPAS . ) This movie turns out to be a pleasant light comedy with a couple of thrills and a good climax , well-made by all concerned . . . but it's hardly a classic . I wish that Murnau's ' 4 Devils ' - - a movie with a setting vaguely similar to this one , which DOES appear to be lost forever , but which ( by surviving accounts ) was apparently a much better film than this one - - had turned up instead . ( No , you clever clots in the back there : I haven't seen ' 4 Devils ' , and I don't know anybody with a print handy . ) Much of the action in ' You Never Know Women ' concerns a troupe of Russian circus performers who ( somewhat improbably ) seem to be playing a long-term or permanent booking in one unnamed U . S . city . According to director Wellman , this troupe were based on ( the real-life ) Le Chauve-Souris . . . but Le Chauve-Souris were a touring troupe , and the Russians in this movie seem to be well stuck in at their current location . They all share a single large hotel room ( including El Brendel and his live goose ) . We see a little bit of the Russian dancers in performance : they're impressive , but the film is hardly scripted around them . In the lead role of Vera , Florence Vidor performs with the troupe but doesn't quite seem to be part of it , and doesn't seem to live with the others . The script never develops her character , and we never learn whether she's a Russian-American or an actual Russian who has somehow become more Americanised than the rest of her troupe . This being a silent film , Florence Vidor's real-life Texas twangs ( and Clive Brook's English accent ) are no handicap . Vera and Eugene Foster ( Lowell Sherman ) ' meet cute ' in a slight variation of the usual formula . While Vera walks through a building site , a girder gives way over her head . In a conventional romance , Sherman would pull her out of the way just in time . Instead , a brickie saves her . . . but Sherman deftly interposes himself , and takes credit for the rescue . This warns us that he's not a conventional hero . SLIGHT SPOILERS COMING . Vera works in the troupe as the target for Norodin's knife-throwing act , and as an aerialist in a butterfly costume . ( With a male stunt double in one shot . ) Norodin ( Brook ) is also an escape artist : we see him shackled , placed in a steamer trunk , the trunk chained shut and then submerged in water . Just when it seems that Norodin must have run out of air , he emerges safely : too bad we don't see how he did it . There's a weird bit of business in which all the troupers line the stage , wearing masks with Auguste clown make-up , and then they unmask one by one . . . to reveal the same make-up underneath . This business is done twice , with no payoff . I was expecting a payoff in which one clown unmasks to reveal an unexpected face . No hope . Sherman's character , a wealthy but caddish playboy , becomes obsessed with Vera and attends every performance , trying to woo her into dating him . I had some trouble believing this : partly due to Sherman's performance ( more later on this ) but largely down to the fact that , frankly , Florence Vidor isn't especially attractive . Surely Sherman's character - - with his wealth , charm and good looks - - would try his luck elsewhere after Vera first rebuffs him . Eventually , Norodin is goaded into doing his escape trick in the river . But the trunk stays in the river too long : by the time it's hauled up for air , he must surely have drowned . Significantly , we don't see his corpse . Yet Vera gradually accepts that Norodin is dead . ( Doesn't she check ? ) The film's climax is exciting , well-shot and edited , but ultimately implausible . Foster becomes so obsessed with Vera that he waylays her in the empty theatre and attempts to rape her . There's a good shot of Lowell Sherman's ( stunt double's ) feet , racing along the tops of a row of theate seats , as he pursues the fleeing Vera . It's no surprise that Norodin is alive after all , but he takes revenge on Foster in an interesting way . ( Norodin is a knife-thrower , remember . ) I normally like El Brendel - - here playing a Russian instead of his usual Swede - - but in this film he's lumbered with some unfunny business involving a goose , and he also has to speak the film's title line . I know that sexual obsession can overrule common sense , but I found it implausible that the wealthy Foster ( Sherman's character ) would be so obsessed with Vera that he would try to rape her , risking arrest and scandal . Lowell Sherman , a rather effete actor , often played epicene cads who seduced women and tossed them aside . He was probably the silent screen's closest equivalent to George Sanders . And yet I've never found Sherman ( unlike Sanders ) believable in such roles . I find Sherman a credible actor when he plays a crypto-sexual role ( as in ' What Price Hollywood ? ' ) or a role in which his sexuality is irrelevant ( such as his fine performance in ' Mammy ' ) , but I've never found him convincing in his woman-chasing roles . In real life , Lowell Sherman was one of the two men who shared the hotel suite with Roscoe Arbuckle for that fateful weekend which degenerated into a drunken revel that destroyed Arbuckle's career . ( The other co-host was an obscure cameraman . ) Oddly , the scandal doesn't seem to have impaired Sherman's career at all . . . oddly , since Sherman in his screen roles often portrayed precisely the sort of lecherous predator that Arbuckle was unfairly accused of being . I'll rate ' You Never Know Women ' .
A moon in a toon .	' Felix Trips through Toyland ' is a typical - - and therefore enjoyable - - example of the low-budget Felix the Cat cartoons drawn by Otto Messmer in stark black-and-white . Messmer , alas , was not well-paid for the long hours he put into these cartoons . At the very end of his life , Messmer was supported largely by charity testimonials produced by some friends of mine at the Collective for Living Cinema in White Street , NYC . In this toon , Felix encounters a dog worrying a little-girl doll . When he rescues the doll and repairs its broken leg , the doll miraculously comes alive . To show her gratitude , she takes Felix to Toyland , where the two of them meet a grown-up male doll in a Pierrot costume , who looks vaguely like Koko the Clown ( from the rival Fleischer studio ) . Pierrot expresses his yearning for the girl doll , but she's having none of it . SPOILER NOW . The most astonishing moment in this toon occurs when the little-girl doll expresses her disdain for Pierrot by mooning him ! She bends over and lifts the back of her skirt so that he ( but not we ) can see whatever she's got underneath . What a surprise ! Elsewhere , we get the usual sight-gags dealing with Felix's detachable tail . I'll rate this toon .
" A Paper of Pins " : Greer Garson guys herself .	I was living in Britain and Australia when ' The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour ' aired in the States , so I didn't have a chance to watch it regularly . I'm aware of the controversies which accompanied this programme , and which only make me that much keener to track down all the episodes . Despite the ' Comedy Hour ' title , this was actually a variety series featuring impressive guest performances by some major music acts across a wide range of musical styles and genres . This synopsis is specifically a review of the fifth episode of the 2nd series of ' The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour ' , one of the few episodes which I've seen . The musical guests in this episode are cried the Association . . . and where did they come up with THAT strange name ? I've heard several of the Association's performances ; I've never enjoyed their close-harmony arrangements , and I tend to dissociate myself from the Association . I can't even remember what song ( s ) they perform here , and that's no loss . ' Mister Patrick Leighton Paulsen ' ( as Dick Smothers introduces him ) does one of his usual unfunny ' editorials ' . I've never found Paulsen funny : he was a deeply angry man who didn't even bother memorising his material ; he relied heavily on cue cards , and towards the end of his life he got increasingly lazy at hiding this penchant . Far and away , the real delight of this episode is a rare guest appearance by the actress Greer Garson , still gorgeous and classy several years after her film career waned . She and Dick duet here on ' A Paper of Pins ' , a beautifully understated English folk-song . Just occasionally , the Smothers Brothers would put aside their political agenda to return to their roots as folk singers . . . by which I mean performers of authentic folk minstrelsy , rather than that hippy-dippy coffee-house stuff . Garson's singing voice is splendid here , and she's very beautiful . When Dick Smothers ( an underrated actor ) sings to her the song's simple lyric - - " I'll give to you a paper of pins , and that's the way my love begins " - - it's easy to imagine that he's genuinely courting her . There has long been a very nasty urban legend about Garson that I'd love to put to rest . Supposedly , when she won her Oscar for ' Mrs Miniver ' , Garson gave a very long boring acceptance speech . Here's the truth : shortly after Garson's Oscar win , gay actor Laird Cregar attended a gay party in Hollywood at which he performed a vicious parody of Garson , giving a long-winded and pompous parody of her speech . Somehow this came to be perceived as the fact . On the very rare occasions when Greer Garson ever discussed the incident , she made plain that she resented the inaccurate rumour . In light of the above , I was astounded by a comedy bit which Garson performs in this Smothers Brothers episode . In the second half of the show , the Smothers siblings and their resident repertory company ( without Garson ) perform a series of skits . Alternating with these , Garson stands at a podium and gives a very long-winded parody of her own Academy Award speech ! I found it deeply surprising that she would do this , since she must have realised that this skit would lend credence to the same rumour that she'd previously disavowed . Well , at least this shows that Garson could make fun of herself . What a classy lady ! My rating of this episode : , mostly for Garson's participation .
George Brent pulls the stops out .	The film ' In This Our Life ' is adapted from the novel of the same name by Ellen Glasgow ( 1873-1945 ) , whose novels had healthy sales figures during her lifetime , yet who is now almost totally forgotten . Her own life was extremely unhappy , largely due to unpleasant memories of her abusive father . ( In her will , Glasgow stipulated that she was not to be buried in the same cemetery as her father . ) If she is remembered at all nowadays , she is classified as both a ' Southern ' author and a feminist . A life-long Virginian , Glasgow typically set her stories in that state . This is the second film directed by John Huston , following his impressive debut with ' The Maltese Falcon ' . Considering how far removed the subject matter is from Huston's usual territory , he does an impressive job here . More about Huston a bit later . Here we have Bette Davis and Olivia de Havilland as sisters , and there are no prizes for guessing which is the bad sister and which is the good ' un . The sisters are named Stanley and Roy , but there's no sexual subtext for those male names . The bad sister , having dumped her boring fiancé ( George Brent ) , sets her cap for the good sister's handsome husband ( Dennis Morgan ) . In her later years , Bette Davis occasionally gave informal talks at colleges in California . My future sister-in-law was present at one of these . During the Q & A , an eager fan breathlessly pointed out that Bette Davis had co-starred with Bogart , Cagney , Spencer Tracy , Ronald Reagan , Errol Flynn and other great male stars . . . so , who was her favourite ? Without hesitation , Davis replied ' George Brent ' , leaving most of the audience to murmur ' Who ? ' . It's not hard to guess the reason for Bette's preference . Brent was a bland leading man who concentrated on making his leading ladies look good , never generating a screen presence with the wattage of Bogart or Cagney . Davis preferred working with Brent because - - unlike Bogart or Cagney - - she didn't have to compete with him . Here , as Davis's jilted fiancé , Brent gives possibly the best performance of his career in a maudlin scene , getting drunk on a park bench . When I saw this scene , I burst out laughing : Brent overplays it ridiculously . . . but this is perhaps the only time in his career when he didn't underplay . A superlative performance is given here by a young African-American actor named Ernest Anderson - - no relation to the much older Eddie ' Rochester ' Anderson - - as a black man unfairly arrested for a crime committed by Davis . ( She's perfectly willing to let him take the rap , of course . ) Anderson conveys intelligence and dignity , in an era when most roles for black actors consisted of ' Yassuh ! ' stereotypes . It's a shame that Anderson's career never prospered ; few decent roles were given to black actors in his day . In this film , I was impressed with a scene in an all-negro cellblock , conveying that segregation persists even in prison . Also seen here , all too briefly , is a young black man named Ernest Morrison . . . who , as a boy , had appeared in Hal Roach's silent comedy shorts as " Sunshine Sammy " . Now , about the director . John Huston's father Walter Huston was one of the few character actors who had attained first-rank stardom . To bring good luck to his son's first two films ( ' The Maltese Falcon ' and ' In This Our Life ' ) , Walter Huston played small unbilled roles in both . Here , he plays the bartender in a roadhouse where Davis tarries . The same scene introduces a character played by Lee Patrick . This actress was a Warners contract player at the time , but she's now remembered solely for playing Bogart's secretary in ' The Maltese Falcon ' ( and hilariously parodying that same character decades later , in ' The Black Bird ' . ) Because Walter Huston and Lee Patrick show up in the same scene in this movie , an annoying ( and untrue ) rumour has arisen , claiming that all the major cast members of ' The Maltese Falcon ' make unbilled appearances in ' In This Our Life ' . Bogart , Astor , Lorre , Greenstreet , Elisha Cook , Uncle Tom Cobley and the suicidal Munchkin from ' The Wizard of Oz ' are all ostensibly hiding in this movie someplace . A nice story , but it's just not true . During the roadhouse sequence , bartender Huston keeps trying to have a conversation with some dimly-seen customers in the background while Davis is talking in the foreground . . . but they're all just unidentified extras . They're definitely NOT the ' Falcon ' cast . Adding to the confusion is the presence in this film of John Hamilton as a cop , after playing a D . A . in ' Falcon ' . There are excellent performances all round here ; John Huston's prowess as an actors ' director is under-rated . Even Hattie McDaniel has better material than usual . Max Steiner's scoring falls below his usual high standard , but even the worst Steiner score is better than almost anybody else's best . My rating : . Rest in peace , Ellen Glasgow .
Victor / Victoria , 1919 vintage	" I Don't Want to Be a Man " is a splendid showcase for the acting talents of Ossi Oswalda , the extremely talented ( and pretty ) soubrette of German silent films . She spends a substantial portion of this film dressed as a man , visiting the dance halls of post-war Berlin . . . and the movie resembles a delightful warm-up for a German version of ' Victor / Victoria ' ( which was indirectly adapted from a German source ) . Oswalda plays a wilful young woman named Ossi Oswalda ( her own name ! ) who lives with her wealthy uncle and a strict governess . Because the uncle can't control his niece , he engages a man named Kursten to supervise her . Kursten turns out to be a handsome man about thirty years old . It is repeatedly impressed upon Ossi that her freedom must be restricted because she is female . ( Quite believable , this , in 1919 . . . when German women didn't have the vote . ) Yet , for all her alleged restrictions , Ossi has no difficulty going out by herself to a haberdashery , where she outfits herself in a man's formal evening outfit . There's an amusing scene in which several male shopclerks compete for the pleasure of taking Ossi's measurements . Back in her room , Ossi struggles with her male costume's stiff celluloid collar as she discovers that perhaps men don't have all the advantages after all . ( No , but in 1919 women were still wearing corsets . ) With her long hair tucked down the back of her collar , Ossi looks like a teenage boy rather than a man , but she does indeed appear convincingly male . . . even though she makes no attempt to suppress her bustline . The most unconvincing part of Ossi's disguise is a ridiculous monocle . Now this young ' man ' goes out for a night on the town , and the ' night ' is as fake as Ossi's manhood . ( The exterior sequences of Berlin take place in the evening , but were clearly shot day-for-night . ) In a dancehall , Ossi sees a young fraulein breaking off with her boyfriend . . . none other than Kursten . When Ossi introduces ' himself ' , Kursten fails to recognise this young ' man ' as his own female charge Ossi ( I found this quite believable , in view of Oswalda's excellent disguise ) . One thing leads to another , and soon Ossi is ( somewhat unwillingly ) experiencing several male rituals such as cigar-smoking , which she thoroughly dislikes . Feeling sick , this young ' man ' gets up and rushes for the public lavatory . Guess which one . SPOILERS COMING . As Kursten becomes increasingly drunk , he starts to look like Rowan Atkinson . Kursten and his ' boy ' friend land up in a horse-drawn cab , where they drunkenly start kissing each other ! For contrived reasons , each of the two drunkards ends up at the other one's home . The next morning , still in her male disguise , Ossi wakes up in Kursten's bed . . . while Kursten wakes up in Ossi's bed , just as the governess arrives to awaken its occupant ! Although Ossi Oswalda's male disguise is highly convincing , most of this movie is rather implausible . Also , the plotline toys with several sexual taboos but doesn't really do anything about them . Several attractive young women flirt with the ' male ' Ossi , but this is not developed . When Ossi feels sick in the dance-hall , she runs to the female lavatory . . . but stops short outside , as she remembers she's pretending to be male just now . Then she goes to the male lavatory . . . but , again , she stops short outside without going in . Perhaps the filmmakers were afraid that audiences in 1919 Germany would be offended if this movie's cross-sex theme was more fully developed . There is of course a reassuring ending , with Ossi safely back in skirts and shirtwaists , vowing " I don't want to be a man " and falling in love with Kursten . But why is she attracted to a man who kisses drunken teenage boys ? I'll rate this movie .
Weight and a waiter ; H . G . Wells did it better .	The UPA studio revolutionised American animation , to the extent that even the monolithic Disney studio emulated UPA's distinctive visual style in ' Toot , Whistle , Plunk and Boom ' . The UPA toon ' The Rise of Duton Lang ' is , by UPA's standards , a fairly straightforward narrative , but it still has a slight twist because of a flashback framing device . SPOILERS AHEAD . The tale is narrated by veteran character actor and voice artist Marvin Miller , who ( over his long career ) demonstrated a wide range of distinctive voices . Yet here for some reason he seems to be imitating the verbal tics of Hans Conreid , voicing a character of the sort that Conreid played ( in live-action and in cartoons ) so frequently : a shabby genteel boulevardier who is down at heels . We see the unnamed narrator strolling down a street , twirling his cane , as he passes a sidewalk restaurant . One table still holds three wine glasses , with a few dregs of wine in each glass . The narrator pours them all together ( I guess he likes varietals ) and sups this , establishing his lack of funds . Then , seeing a meek little customer enjoying a martini , he promptly bends this man's ear with the tale of Duton Lang . . . which we witness in flashback . Duton ( rhymes with ' futon ' ) Lang was a brilliant chemist who did much to benefit humanity yet spent very little time actually working , because his passion was for eating . Offered an award for his achievements , he attends the ceremony only because it includes a banquet . Eventually , salad-dodger Duton gorges himself until he weights 497 pounds . Now it dawns on him that he ought to lose weight . Duton promptly invents a chemical which , when sprinkled on his food , does not impair its taste but eliminates its weight-gain potential . He continues to eat liberally , yet rapidly loses weight . So , why is he still so fat ? Because Duton hasn't actually lost girth . . . he has merely lost WEIGHT . He prevails on his friend ( the narrator ) to assist him , but the narrator is helpless to intervene as Duton sails into the sky , gone forever . The ' rise ' of Duton Lang was his downfall . Meanwhile , the narrator has signalled the waiter to keep a steady supply of martinis coming , at the expense of the meek little customer . After the narrator departs , the waiter tells the customer that he got off easy . . . last week , the same cadger spun out the story to an even longer narrative , at the expense of a customer who got lumbered with a larger bill ! The credits of this toon say that ' The Rise of Duton Lang ' is based on a story by Percival Wilde , published in Esquire magazine . As I've not read that story , I can't say how faithful this adaptation is . However , way back in 1903 , H . G . Wells wrote a story - - ' The Truth about Pyecraft ' - - with precisely the same gimmick : an immensely fat man hopes to lose his GIRTH ( by applying an ancient Hindu weight-loss recipe , this time ) . . . with the result that he remains as fat as ever , but loses so much WEIGHT that he threatens to float away . In Wells's story , Pyecraft resorts to wearing sheet-lead underwear . In this version , poor Duton Lang floats away . . . like a character in Joseph Payne Brennan's story ' Levitation ' , published three years after this UPA cartoon was released . The framing gimmick in this cartoon isn't original , either : it seems to be based on the Jorkens stories by Lord Dunsany , in which a clubman cadges a steady supply of drinks by spinning wild stories . The UPA toons normally did not lack for visual imagination , so I was annoyed that most of the shots here of Duton stuffing himself relied on the same image : he's holding a drumstick with one bite taken out of it . ( This device is such a cliché , even the ' Heathcliff ' comic strip uses it . ) Apparently nobody ever eats poultry : they just take one bite out of the drumstick and then throw away the rest of the bird . I realise that much animation relies on recycled cel frames : I can understand Hanna-Barbera or even Warner Brothers repeating the same drawings . . . but ' The Rise of Duton Lang ' very oddly keeps repeating this drumstick image yet draws it differently each time , showing only an lack of imagination ( not normally a problem at UPA ) rather than an economy of labour . Another animator , Jay Ward , always admitted how thoroughly his own studio's animation was influenced by UPA . Indeed , ' The Rise of Duton Lang ' includes a shot of Lang's laboratory which looks remarkably like Mr Peabody's lab in the Jay Ward cartoons . I almost expected to see a Wayback machine . One of the scriptwriters on this cartoon , who rejoiced in the name T . Hee , has a credit which isn't listed on his IMDb page . In the classic Twilight Zone episode ' The Dummy ' , Cliff Robertson played a ventriloquist who eventually swaps places with his own figure ( dummy ) . For the final sequence in that episode , T . Hee sculpted the head of the ventriloquist's dummy : a caricature of Robertson's own face . ' The Rise of Duton Lang ' lacks the visual innovation of so many other UPA cartoons , and isn't especially funny either . It's below UPA's usual standards , but even the worst UPA cartoon ( which this isn't ) is much better than 99 % of the animated dreck out there . I'll rate this one . Waiter : the check , please !
. . . and they won't bereave you , either .	' They Won't Believe Me ' is an excellent second-rank ' noir ' drama . I usually dislike movies told in flashback , but here the gimmick works . Larry Ballantyne ( Robert Young ) is on trial for murdering Verna Carlson ( Susan Hayward ) . His testimony constitutes the bulk of the film's action , in flashback . In the courtroom , we see witnesses who have testified against Ballantyne ; when he meets these undistinguished people during the flashback , we know they'll be major figures in his downfall . SPOILERS THROUGHOUT . There is one annoying and unnecessary gimmick : a homicide lieutenant improbably sits in the courtroom with his face turned away from the bench ( and the camera ) , so that when we meet him during the flashback we don't recognise him . Obscure actor George Tyne gives a stand-out performance in this role . Tom Powers is also excellent as the head of the brokerage firm in which Larry's wife bought him a partnership . Robert Young skilfully plays against his nice-guy image as Ballantyne , who is married to a wealthy beautiful woman but can't help starting relationships with other women : first Janice ( played by the dull Jane Greer ) , then Verna . As portrayed by Rita Johnson , Ballantyne's wife Greta is sexier and classier ( and richer ) than these other women , so I couldn't sympathise with his flirtations . Even Greta's aunt Martha ( Lillian Bronson ) is sexier and classier than Larry's bits on the side . After planning various crimes , including embezzlement , Larry makes a getaway with Verna that culminates in a road accident : Larry escapes , but Verna is burnt beyond recognition . When Larry wakes up in hospital , we get the visual cliche of the hospital patient with head bandages but no head injuries . Because Verna was wearing a wedding ring - an incredibly cheap one that Greta never would have worn - the authorities assume that the dead woman is Greta . When Larry returns to his wife's secluded ranch , he finds Greta conveniently dead in a riding accident . There's some clever imagery with a palomino horse symbolising Fate . ( I hadn't realised that Fate is a gelding . ) Larry hides Greta's corpse on her ranch , knowing that Verna was issued a death certificate as Greta . But then the authorities come looking for Verna , and they think Larry stashed her corpse on Greta's ranch . . . There's plenty of irony here , and some typical noir narration about Fate dealing a hand from a new deck of cards , and so forth . The flashback device raises no end of questions . Traditionally , audiences don't like dishonest flashbacks ( the single biggest reason for the failure of Hitchcock's ' Stage Fright ' ) : we want to believe that what we see depicted onscreen is what actually happened . Rather implausibly , we see here that Larry's trysts with other women are quite innocent and non-sexual : his friendship with Janice centres on their mutual love of deep-sea fishing ! Also , although Larry benefits from the deaths of Verna and Greta , we clearly see that their deaths ( and the misidentification of Verna's corpse as Greta ) are down to circumstances outside Larry's control . Are we witnessing the truth , or are Larry's flashbacks skewed to benefit himself ? In flashback , we see Larry finding Greta's corpse after a riding accident , but for all we know he murdered her and then lied about it . Just before the jury's verdict is read , something utterly unexpected happens . I didn't see it coming , but as soon as it happened I knew what the jury's verdict would be . A small but key role ( as the court clerk ) is played by Milton Parsons , who ranks high on my list of favourite character actors . Unfortunately , Parsons speaks his ( few ) lines in this film with the affected accent that he sometimes used . This accent worked well for Parsons when he played mad scientists or perverts , but here it brings more attention to Parsons than his role merits . Still , the last shot in this film is a tight close-up of Parsons's skull-like face as he reads the jury's verdict . ' They Won't Believe Me ' is an excellent film , and I'll rate it .
Some Polish hams and one kielbasa .	' Ada ! To nie wypada ! ' was screened for me by a native Pole , who was kind enough to translate some of the dialogue and jokes for me . IMDb's description of this film ( as a comedy ) is not quite accurate : the film is light-hearted , and some of it is quite funny , but there is far more emphasis on singing and dancing than on humour , so I would classify this film as a musical . . . though it's a funny one , not a serious one . Also , I disagree with IMDb's synopsis which describes the heroine as a ' tomboy ' : she's a free-spirited hellion of the Betty Hutton type , but not very hoydenish with it . The movie's title translates as ' Ada ! That's not polite ! ' which is also the title of the best and most prominent song in this film's score . I hope I've spelt all these names properly . Here goes : Ada Dziewanowski ( Loda Niemirzanka ) comes from a respectable and wealthy family , but she is outgoing and impulsive , instead of being the subdued ' lady-like ' type that her widower father ( Antoni Fertner ) feels she should be . Her father has chosen a husband for her : Frederick ( Alexander Zabcynski ) , the handsome young son of a baron . But Ada's father insists that she must learn proper behaviour before getting married . So , he sends her off to a very strict finishing school . As luck would have it , the school's music teacher ( Casimir Krukowski ) has written a full-blown operetta . This is Ada's cue to go into Little Miss Fix-It mode . She squeezes enough kopecks out of her father's exchequer to mount a full-scale production of the operetta , performed by her talented friends from the school . This movie's scriptwriter wants to make sure there's no possible doubt in our minds that our heroine's motives are unselfish , so Ada doesn't cast herself in the lead role : that part goes to the much older Eira Roletti , who is such a flaming bitch that it's obvious she's not going to make it to opening night . SPOILERS COMING : This whole movie is froth , so the ending meets all the audience's expectations . At the last minute on opening night , Eira can't go on , so Ada ( for everybody else's sake , of course ) is forced to step into the starring role . The show is of course a huge hit , and all ends happily . I was hoping that Freddy would refuse to marry Ada on the grounds that she's a common vulgar actress ( ugh ! ) , but I guess he was too busy counting her father's money . ' Ada ! That's not polite ! ' never attempts to be anything more than entertainment . It's more successful than I'd expected it to be , and the photography ( especially in the crowd scenes and chorus numbers ) is better than I'd hoped . It's nice to know that people in Poland in 1936 could still divert themselves with froth like this . In the closing number , I could hear jackboots approaching from stage left ( Germany ) and from stage right ( Russia ) . I'll rate this .
Button Up Your Overcoat !	I viewed UCLA's restored print of this musical , an early example of two-strip Technicolor . Much of the action takes place on golf links and fairways , so I expected to see vibrant greens . . . and I DID see some bright hues of green in the actress's costumes . But the foliage and fairways were strangely subdued . All of the flesh tones are very pink , and the women appear to be wearing too much rouge . All the man-made objects have got nice vibrant Easter Egg colours , though . This is one of those candyfloss 1920s musicals where strangers instantly fall in love as soon as they clap eyes on each other . All the gals are man-hungry and randy with it , and the comedy lead ( Jack Haley ) is frightened of women . Haley's character has ' trick eyebrows ' which force him to pull a face whenever he thinks about sex . There's plenty of innuendo here . . . and lots and lots and lots of expository dialogue . I kept expecting someone to enter with a racquet while saying ' Tennis , anyone ? ' . . . except that the action takes place at a golf course . SPOILING ONE PUNCH LINE . For the comedy set piece , Haley and Eugene Palllette must infiltrate the women's changing room to retrieve a McGuffin . I expected them to go in disguised as women , but this movie fooled me : they go in disguised as plumbers , and then they get OUT disguised as women . The male lead in this movie is former silent-film star Buddy Rogers , who once took the trouble to answer my questions when I briefly met him . It pains me to report that his singing voice is just tolerable , and he shows no skill with dialogue . Surprisingly , this crude musical spawned one hit song : ' Button Up Your Overcoat ' , performed enthusiastically by Haley and Zelma O'Neal . A couple of the other songs have dull melodies enlivened by lyrics that just occasionally turn risqué . The choreography is wittier than I'd hoped , and one chorus number features a brief overhead shot . . . several years before Busby Berkeley made this device his personal trademark . Thelma Todd is quite good as the villain , in a role outside her usual range . The very English character actor Claude King is cast here as a stage Scotsman , lumbered with Harry Lauder's ' hoot mon ' accent . Nancy Carroll is quite fetching in a mini-kilt . I must disagree with IMDb reviewer Arne Andersen , who says that the character dubbed Dinty Moore in this movie is named for a famous restaurateur . That name originated with a fictional character in George McManus's comic strip ' Bringing Up Father ' . Eventually , a restaurant was named after the comic-strip character . . . but there never was a real person named Dinty Moore , just as there isn't a real person named Beefsteak Charlie . ' Follow Thru ' is really more interesting as an historical artefact than as a musical , but I enjoyed it . I'll rate this early musical .
Waterhouse's watershed	Following the huge success of Keith Waterhouse's ' Billy Liar ' as a novel , stage play and film , it was inevitable that this ' oop North ' Walter Mitty character would star in a television series . I saw ' Billy Liar ' when it was originally transmitted . While never quite attaining ' Fawlty Towers ' heights of hilarity , this programme was consistently funny , with at least two or three solid belly-laughs per episode . To the best of my knowledge , ' Billy Liar ' has never been repeated in Britain , nor shown in America . If the original tapes still exist , I can't imagine why they're being suppressed . . . unless perhaps Keith Waterhouse has some legal reason for suppressing them . However , as he was head writer for this sitcom , I can't guess what his objections might be . Newcomer Jeff Rawle was perfectly cast as callow Billy Fisher , whose imagination far outstrips his achievements . Much of the substantial humour in this sitcom sprung from the interaction between Billy and his sarcastic father Geoffrey , or between Billy and his long-suffering employer , Mr Shadrack the undertaker . Perhaps what's discouraged programmers from repeating this sitcom is the extreme 1970s look of the series . Waterhouse created Billy Liar in the 1950s and saw him through the swinging Sixties , yet Jeff Rawle's interpretation of Billy Liar is firmly trapped in the 1970s , and that naff decade's definition of manliness . Rawle is emaciated , clean-shaven , wistful , with flares and longish hair . . . looking almost like a girl , in other words . Not effeminate , yet somehow almost feminine . By way of contrast , Billy's father Geoffrey is played by George Cooper with absolutely no hair at all . It may well be that slap-headed Geoffrey Fisher's resentment of his son is down to his own baldness versus his son's excess of hair . On the vocal front , Rawle's accent was just a shade too Brum for this North Country character , but Cooper's broad Northern vowels were spot-on . I never identified with Billy Liar , me - - my own lies were of a different sort , told for a different reason - - but this series aired during a troublesome time in my own life . . . and I'd be delighted to see these episodes again , partly on their own merit but largely because of the memories they would summon regarding my own troubles at this time . I'll rate ' Billy Liar ' .
First movie to use miniatures	The Yorkshire-born showman J . Stuart Blackton was an important figure in the early history of American movies . Most of his early films were newsreel-style records of actual current events . . . but their historical value is compromised , because Blackton's films are generally re-enactments of these incidents ( often with blatant fakery ) , filmed days or weeks after they occurred . ' Windsor Hotel Fire ' has more historical value than most of Blackton's counterfeit newsreels , because it atypically contains authentic footage of its subject . Built in 1873 , the Windsor was a 500-room luxury hotel , taking up an entire city block at Fifth Avenue and 46th Street in Manhattan . In 1899 , the hotel burnt to the ground with great loss of life . Blackton and his cameraman partner Albert E . Smith rushed to the scene and captured footage while the wreckage was still smouldering . Back in their tiny 10'x12 ' studio in Brooklyn , they consulted photographs of the Windsor in its previous glory , and built a scale model of the Windsor and the surrounding block , including street lamps and horse carriages . They then set fire to this and filmed the results , while stagehands standing out of camera range blew cigarette smoke towards the camera . The resulting film is a weird hybrid . The first sequence is blatantly faked , with the model out of scale and the normal-sized flames out of proportion to the tiny hotel . The ' horses ' at the kerb remain placid and motionless in their carriage-tracings , despite the raging fire close by . The smoke is moving towards the hotel from out of frame , rather than originating in the burning building . However , after this counterfeit conflagration , the film then cuts to authentic footage of the magnificent Windsor in ruins after the fire . It is this harrowing footage ( not the laughable fakery which precedes it ) that makes ' Windsor Fire ' a significant historic document . And this is almost certainly the very first motion picture to create special-effects footage by using miniatures . I'll rate this early movie . Pass the marshmallows !
One actress does not equal two boys	I well and truly dislike movies in which adult women perform boys ' roles . I can't understand why so many people are enchanted by the spectacle of middle-aged Mary Martin impersonating Peter Pan . This trend is especially distressing when the actress is ( unlike Mary Martin ) sexually attractive ; trying to suspend disbelief , I attempt to persuade myself that the voluptuous shapely damsel onscreen is an underage boy . . . ugh ! No thanks ! This silent version of ' The Prince and the Pauper ' ( filmed only 5 years after Mark Twain's death ) features Marguerite Clark ( in her 30s ) in the dual role of the two turnabout boys . As a physical impersonation of a male child , Miss Clark's performance is a failure . . . especially when she wears tights and a jerkin . But this production has its merits . Directed by Edwin S . Porter , this is very much an abbreviated version of Mark Twain's novel . . . but it's fast-moving and visually distinctive . The sets are a bit too clean and stylised to convincingly depict Tudor England , especially the scenes of Tom Canty's father and the disguised prince in the London slums . To her credit , Miss Clark does a great deal of high-spirited rough-and-tumble stunt work ( appropriate to the roles she's playing ) even though she utterly failed to convince me that she was one boy , much less two . Regrettably , her performance as the prince is nearly identical to her performance as the pauper . This condensed adaptation leaves out most of Twain's social satire . In his novel , Twain tried to point out the arbitrary nature of monarchy : the pauper ( disguised as a prince ) turned out to be quite as good a king as the prince born to that role . But this movie ( along with several other film versions ) clearly sides with monarchial entitlement , indicating that the displaced Prince Edward ( made king by Henry VIII's death ) is rightly entitled to regain his throne . The camera set-ups and pacing throughout this movie do credit to Porter's skills as a director , and there are some good action sequences . I'll rate this movie .
They must have been in Seine .	Of all the major Hollywood studios , Warner Brothers were always the most cheese-paring . All of their musicals - - except the wonderful ' Yankee Doodle Dandy ' and some later adaptations of Broadway musicals - - are marred by extremely low budgets and obvious economy measures . ' April in Paris ' is one of several Warners musicals featuring an established popular ditty ( with a stiff price-tag for performance rights ) as the movie's title song , buttressed by some very forgettable songs by resident Warners tunesmiths . Except for one high-spirited and high-kicking number called ' Ring the Bell Tonight ' , only the E . Y . Harburg / Vernon Duke title song is memorable here . Doris Day amazes me , not only for her unearthly beauty and her quiet sex appeal , and for her underrated acting ability , but also for her musical talents . I've read that Day originally trained as a dancer , but switched to a career as a vocalist after she was injured in a car accident . Her singing voice is so clear and beautiful , I've difficulty believing that singing was her second choice of career . And , as she proves here , she has no physical handicap as a dancer . . . unless you count the dull choreography of LeRoy Prinz . Ray Bolger is an interesting choice of romantic leads for Day , but the two of them don't really team very well . Here , he plays a character very similar to the one played by Donald O'Connor in ' Are You with It ? ' : a repressed wonk who turns out to be a superb dancer . Bolger ( an underrated actor ) is quite good in his straight scenes here as a harried bureaucrat , a less nelly version of Edward Everett Horton . . . but that character just doesn't match up with Bolger's dazzling dance numbers . Bolger's Massachusetts accent is much more obvious here than in any of his other films . Bolger was sometimes required to play epicene men , as in the Broadway musical ' By Jupiter ' . Here , he's impressively virile , as he strips off his dinner jacket and lights into some rapid-fire nerve taps far more proficient than Ann Miller's . I always enjoy watching Bolger dance . Here , regrettably - - blame it on LeRoy Prinz - - Bolger doesn't do anything he hasn't done better in several better musicals , except for a brief trick shot in which he dances between two full-length portraits of Washington and Lincoln ( also played by Bolger ) who dance along with him . I was impressed with a brief pas de deux between Bolger and Day , in which she dances conventionally but manages to keep up with Bolger while he does his usual " Where's Charley ? " moves . The contrived plot line requires Bolger and Day to mistakenly believe they're married to each other . Two Frenchmen perform the wedding service without actually being qualified for that job . This being a Hollywood film of the 1950s , it's imperative that the fake marriage remain unconsummated , so the two Frenchmen then have conscience pangs and sabotage the marital bed so that no sex can take place . . . instead of simply admitting their deception . Speaking of 1950s morals : this movie's dialogue features several occurrences of the word ' gay ' in its innocent sense . Two of my least favourite movie clichés are : every building in Washington DC is directly across the street from the Capitol , and every location in Paris has a clear view of the Eiffel Tower . We get both of those clichés in this movie . On the positive side , we get a brief appearance by character actor Shepard Menken as a Parisian waiter . Actress Eve Miller does her best in an unplayable role as Day's rival . Eve Miller's acting career never quite caught on ; she suicided shortly after her fiftieth birthday . The movie's weird plot gives us Claude Dauphin as an omniscient Frenchman . A gag sequence requires that Ray Bolger's hat be several sizes too large . . . but later the same chapeau fits him perfectly , and later still it's too large again when the scriptwriter recycles the gag . This movie is more than competently directed by the underrated David Butler , but matters are not helped by a script which requires Day's and Bolger's characters to be unable to make up their minds about deeply important issues such as love and career . Still , as enjoyable froth , I'll rate ' April in Paris ' .
Pretty maids all in a row ? Well , Grace and Marcy , at least .	In Frank Sinatra's first three films , he was purely a speciality act : ostensibly playing himself , he merely shows up to croon a song during a nightclub sequence in somebody else's movie . In his fourth film , the very enjoyable ' Higher and Higher ' , Young Blue Eyes transitions into an acting career by playing an actual role . . . a task made easier because he's playing himself in a fictional story that gives him a chance to croon a few numbers . Sinatra's entrance is quite funny . Michele Morgan hears a knock at the door , and asks who's there . From outside , a Hoboken-toned voice answers ' Frank Sinatra ' . Sure enough . . . The opening credits of ' Higher and Higher ' may confuse some viewers , as the names of songwriters Rodgers and Hart are prominently displayed . In fact , they only contributed one song to this musical : ' Disgustingly Rich ' , which this cast manage to toss off as a sort of intro to an entirely different song , ' I'm a Debutante ' . Interestingly , that Rodgers & Hart song - - one of their weakest - - is perhaps the least enjoyable song in this movie's score ; several others are lively up-tempo numbers , notably ' It's a Most Important Affair ' , ' When It Comes to Love , You're On Your Own ' and ' I Saw You First ' . Sinatra's good in this movie , but he would do better work ( and sing better material ) elsewhere . The real merits of ' Higher and Higher ' are the delightful turns by some performers who rarely made films . Paul and Grace Hartman were an extremely popular husband-wife dance team who starred in several Broadway revues : genuinely graceful ballroom dancers , they put plenty of physical comedy into their dance material . ( Here , Grace does a high kick that knocks a shoe out of Paul's hands . ) Grace Hartman , who died of cancer at age 48 , did almost no film work , so it's a real pleasure that this film gives us a rare chance to see her close-up , to hear her beautiful singing voice and to notice how sexy she looks in her maid's uniform . After Grace Hartman's death , her husband had a long career as a character actor , just occasionally dancing solo . ( Or alongside Ken Berry in one memorable episode of ' Mayberry RFD ' . ) Also quite attractive in a maid's uniform here in ' Higher and Higher ' is the vivacious teenage singer Marcy McGuire . Why didn't this talented girl make more movies ? Perhaps she was just a bit too similar in personality to Betty Hutton . I enjoy Hutton's performances but I like Marcy McGuire even better . Near the end of ' Higher and Higher ' there's an amusing bit of physical business featuring McGuire and Mary Wickes as waitresses , taking it in turns to move from table to table in a nightclub . The alternating strides of short McGuire and tall gawky Wickes are hilarious ! Regrettably , although Leon Errol plays a large role in ' Higher and Higher ' , he is given almost no comedy business : not once does he do his famous rubber-legged dance . Jack Haley , despite his prominent billing , is also wasted . Very well-represented here is Dooley Wilson , inevitably remembered as Sam from ' Casablanca ' . In that film , Wilson did his own singing but faked his keyboard performance of ' As Time Goes By ' . ( In real life , Wilson couldn't play piano . ) Here in ' Higher and Higher ' , he sings pleasingly and gives some amusing reactions to the other players . Less enjoyable is Mel Odious , I mean Mel Torme . Victor Borge gives a rare film performance here , handling his dialogue deftly but never doing any of the keyboard comedy which he later did successfully in his stage shows . The plot ? Forget it . ' Higher and Higher ' is nobody's idea of a ' great ' musical , but it's an enjoyable delight , and I'll rate it . Director Tim Whelan , who worked in Britain as well as in Hollywood , deserves to be much better known .
Cherry Blow meets Elmer .	I viewed a print of ' Broadway Love ' at Eastman House in Rochester , NY . By the way , for all you old-movie lovers who wish that more so-called ' lost ' films would become available : there are hundreds ( maybe thousands ) of obscure and not-so-obscure films archived at Eastman House that are not viewable in their present condition , because Eastman House lack the funds to restore them . If you ( yes , YOU out there ) would make a tax-deductible donation to Eastman House , you could help bring a ' lost ' film back from the dead . UPDATE : More than a year after posting this review , I saw ' Broadway Love ' again at the 2006 Cinema Muto festival in Sacile , Italy . Maybe some of you have heeded my pleas , and are donating money to help restore some so-called ' lost ' films . If so , I thank you . ' Broadway Love " was directed and co-scripted by Ida May Park , an early director whose work is genuinely noteworthy in its own right , not merely because she was a woman . Park's films tend to feature female protagonists in realistic situations from the period shortly before American women got the vote . Midge O'Hara ( Dorothy Phillips ) is a small-town gal who goes to New York in hope of success as a Broadway actress . She meets a good-time gal named Cherry Blow ( ! ) , who is ostensibly a chorus girl but is actually a ' party girl ' : the film is remarkably explicit about this . Cherry Blow has already sucked all the money out of wealthy playboy Jack Chalvey , no longer so wealthy . By now , Midge is working as a ' chorus girl ' , though the film implies that this description might be more figurative than literal . Midge had a ' fellow ' back home named Elmer Watkins : we read his name on screen ( in a letter from Midge's aunt ) before we meet him . Having seen several comedies in which Buster Keaton played hick characters named Elmer ( to say nothing of Elmer Fudd ) , I expected Elmer Watkins to be a real hick rube . Surprise ! He turns out to be a realistic bucolic character , not a stereotype . But Elmer is played by Lon Chaney , so it's no surprise that this actor would give a realistic and credible performance . Elmer has come to New York to propose to Midge and take her home , but she mocks his rustic appearance . He follows her to a wild party . ( This movie was made before Prohibition , yet the booze they're drinking in this scene appears to be bathtub gin . ) Embarrassed by Elmer's attentions , Midge asks a man named Rockwell to take her back to her flat . Rockwell complies , but when they get there he tries to force himself on her , clearly believing that a chorus girl won't say no . Midge flings herself out of Rockwell's moving auto ( nice stuntwork here ) , and is injured . Rockwell , being basically a decent chap , pays her hospital bill . Elmer abruptly marries another woman , but decides to hang about New York with her for some reason . In contrived circumstances , Midge persuades Chalvey to pretend to be her husband , hoping to make Elmer jealous . Meanwhile , Rockwell is showing legitimate romantic interest in Midge . . . until he learns from Elmer that she's married to Chalvey . SPOILER NOW . All ends happily , after some confusion . There are some fairly contrived plot twists here , but many other photo-dramas of this period are far more guilty of that particular crime . Park does an excellent job of telling this story on a low budget : much of the story takes place in Manhattan's theatre district but has clearly been filmed elsewhere . The entire cast give excellent performances . As Elmer , Chaney's performance is notable because his character doesn't fit in with these sophisticated city types , and could easily have become a stereotype , yet Chaney expertly keeps the character fresh . Juanita Hansen , who often played sluttish roles , is impressive as Cherry Blow : I regret that her character's name is more laughable than Park might have intended . I'll rate ' Broadway Love ' . Send a donation to Eastman House , people !
Light-hearted ' trick ' film ; odd ending .	I saw this movie in October 2005 at le Giornate del Cinema Muto in Sacile , Italy . The screening was enhanced by a splendid live-music performance : composed , arranged and performed by Maud Nelissen accompanied by the Sprockets ( an ensemble who specialise in accompanying silent films ) ! Well done , all ! . . . and a first-rate choice , in view of this film's musical subject matter . Actually , it's not surprising that so many silent films are ABOUT music , as contemporary audiences generally watched them with whatever musical accompaniment was available . True silent films were very seldom silent . ' Onésime and the Heart of a Romany ' is a delightful short film : an early example of a ' trick ' film but quite different in style and mood from the trick films of Georges Méliès . IMDb's synopsis seems to be accurate , except that the attractive young lady with Monsieur Onésime is described as his fiancée : in the print which I viewed , the French intertitles identify her as his bride . The clothes are interesting here : Onésime wears spats , his wife wears a titfer which is halfway between a cloche and a picture hat . The Gypsy mandolinist wears buskins ! When the swarthy Gypsy first begins to play his mandolin , Onésime and his bride do some spirited dancing . Then , matters become acrobatic as the actor playing Onésime performs some impressive one-handed tinsikas ( with the actress playing his bride supporting his other hand ) . There is some clever undercranking , as the staff in the hotel's kitchen begin waltzing with the stove ! I normally dislike undercranking , as it's been over-used as a cheap gimmick . But when this movie was made in 1913 , undercranking was still a fairly innovative technique , so I'll forgive its use here . SPOILER COMING . The entire film is very light-hearted , but the mood changes in the very last shot . . . which is deeply haunting . Onésime and his bride , still waltzing hand in hand , dance right into the ocean's surf , with the Gypsy mandolinist accompanying them . Suddenly , all three figures fade away , leaving only the incoming tide . I suppose that this was meant as a happy ending : man and wife have become one with the universe . Yet there's a sinister aspect to the Gypsy , and this ending reminded me of Rhoda Broughton's very creepy horror story ' The Man with the Nose ' , in which a sinister foreign man abducts a newlywed bride . Have Monsieur and Madame Onésime vanished willingly , or have they been abducted ? Because the ending is ambiguous - - and because the Romany character is an ethnic stereotype - - I'll rate this otherwise delightful movie only .
Infernal tableaux	WARNING : This review contains explicit language which some people may find offensive . I attended a special screening of " L'Inferno " at the Rubin Museum of Art in Manhattan ; for this screening , the film's intertitles had been removed , and the movie's dialogue and narration were spoken live by the brilliant actors Len Cariou and Roberta Maxwell , accompanied by an appropriately hellish violin score by Gil Morgenstern . For all its considerable crudeness , this early film is still powerful . Much of its impact is due to the decision to depict the ( male ) inhabitants of Hell entirely naked . ( A couple of them are wanting an arm or a leg . ) The image of naked men desperately scrambling for room in Charon's cramped coracle is far more effective than the same image would have been with costumed actors . The film would have been even more powerful had it included female nudity , although I concede that this would have been too much to expect in 1911 . Even the nudity which we see here is undercut by the fact that some of the men in Hell are wearing nappies . The notorious sequence in the river of excrement is cleaned up somewhat here , to feature merely a river of dirty water . The narration includes a reference to the famous sign at the entrance to Hell - - " Abandon all hope , ye who enter here " - - yet we never see this sign ; perhaps it was rendered in Italian in the original prints of this film , and was therefore cut out of prints exhibited outside Italy . The exterior scenes are shot against stark cliffs plunging perpendicularly to the sea , affording no shelter : the landscapes of Hell . Several flashbacks contain interior shots , featuring painted sets of the style which modern audiences will attribute to French film-maker Georges Melies . I try to perceive every film that I view in the context of its own time . Regrettably , most of the acting here is crude even by 1911 standards . The subject matter allows for some melodramatic overacting , yet these actors exceed the limits . The special effects , too , are crude by 1911 standards . Several of the double exposures are off-register , with visible " shimmy " . The hell-hound Cerberus looks like a three-headed ostrich cross-bred with a poodle . Georges Melies was doing more convincing special effects in 1906 . I did like the clever method of giving Beatrice a halo by placing a whirligig behind the actress's head . The costumes in the flashback sequences are impressive . For the screening which I attended , the original Italian intertitles were newly translated by Robert Pinsky of the Poetry Society of America . I feel that he should have been less literal and more colloquial : when Dante described a damned soul " making a fig " , it wasn't immediately clear to the ( mostly American ) audience that this referred to an obscene hand-gesture . For all its crudity , this is an astonishing film with great visual impact . I wish that the same production company had tackled Dante's " Purgatorio " and " Paradiso " . My rating : .
sicko psycho sucko sex . . . I loved it !	' Mondo New York ' is sick , twisted , perverted and has absolutely no socially-redeeming value . I loved every second of it ! This movie purports to be a documentary look at some of the strange performance art in New York City's East Village , but ' Mondo New York ' is the cinematic equivalent of those old-time pornographic paperbacks that pretended to be medical case studies : the whole point of this movie is to wallow gratuitously in the excess and sleaze shown onscreen . One of the earliest ( and best ) turns in this film is the classically-trained Phoebe Legere , performing on her accordion a song called ' Marilyn ' ( about guess-which actress ) . Ms Legere has one of the most beautiful singing voices I've ever heard , and the fact that this voice emerges from an incredibly sexy body makes things even more interesting . By the end of her song , Ms Legere is lying supine on the floor and pumping her accordion in a way that seems downright lascivious , while flailing her legs and never skipping a beat . Her revealing costume makes it clear that she shaves . A more surprising turn ( slightly less enjoyable ) is provided by performance artist Ann Magnuson , who shows up in a bright sunlit exterior that looks like Central Park ( strange , as this movie is set in the East Village on a dark night ) . Magnuson is wearing an elaborate fairy-princess get-up , and reciting a saccharine fairy tale . This is very much a departure from Ann Magnuson's usual ' performance art ' , which I've seen onstage . WARNING : Don't eat anything during Karen Finley's routine . Nor a couple of the others . The one thing I didn't like about ' Mondo New York ' was its hypocritical framing device . We see a very attractive young blonde woman ( Shannah Laumeister ) who strides from one alternative-theatre venue to another , in the Alphabet City region of lower Manhattan . Her sequences are shot and edited in a manner that encourages us to identify with her . ( An interesting decision , as the target audience for this film is probably young males who have no desire to identify with a woman . ) She seats herself in the audience of a performance space , and the act begins . Now here's where it gets hypocritical : whenever the act onstage reaches the borders of tastelessness ( which happens pretty often ) , the blonde chick gets up and leaves . . . but the camera stays behind to catch the act in all its disgusting glory . Only after the act is over do we cut back to the blonde woman striding through the streets to the next venue . We see this happening over and over . Obviously , we're meant to congratulate ourselves that we ( like this blonde chick ) have the good taste to get up and walk out whenever the onstage action is getting too tasteless . . . except that ( unlike the blonde chick ) we also stay behind and watch all the perversion . That dishonesty - - not the perversion itself - - is what I find so offensive about this movie . Still , she sure is a nice-looking blonde chick . Not as sexy as Phoebe Legere , though . On second thought , ' Mondo New York ' actually has some socially-redeeming value , because years from now people will wonder what all that fuss was about concerning something called ' performance art ' . This movie will show them . . . and it will prove that ' performance art ' was usually something very empty and pretentious . But sometimes very sexy . I'll rate ' Mondo New York ' . . . but keep the barf bags handy .
Stark and moody	' Roses Bloom on the Meadow-Grave ' belongs in the subgroup of movies known as ' Heimatfilm ' , a film genre unique to the German-speaking world . ' Heimat ' is the German word for ' country ' or ' homeland ' . Heimatfilmen take place largely outdoors , emphasising the countryside of Germany , Austria and Switzerland . There is usually a young heroine who somehow embodies the spirit of the land . Nature is celebrated , specifically Germanic nature . But the typical Heimatfilm is celebratory in nature , and celebratory of nature . ' Meadow-Grave ' is extremely unusual , in that it's a dark , morbid Heimatfilm with a Gothic atmosphere . Dorothee is a peasant girl , daughter of farmers Wilhelm and Friederike . They can barely stake out a living on their small tract in the Lüneburg Moor . Her parents arrange Dorothee's betrothal to Dietrich Eschmann , a wealthy old lecher . But Dorothee is in love with her childhood companion Ludwig , who has now become a successful architect in the big city . Eventually , Eschmann threatens her . Dorothee lures him out to a lonely spot on the moors . In order to save herself from Eschmann's clutches , Dorothee may have to die on the moors . Has she any hope of happiness ? This film is pervaded by a strong sense of Germanic doom , of destiny being more powerful than human desires . None of this is unusual for German subject matter , but it's very unusual indeed within the Heimatfilm structure . This movie's photography is stark , moody and distinctive . Most of the leading actors give excellent performances , and the ending is impressive . I'll rate this movie .
The heroine's named Mary Darling , but the movie's funny anyway .	I don't much give a Hoot about Gibson , but ' 40-Horse Hawkins ' is a welcome variation of the usual Hoot Gibson formula , giving him more comedy sequences than usual , and taking place mostly away from the prairies and sagebrush . Gibson is here a callow youth who tries holding various jobs , and there's an amusing running gag : every time Gibson gets a new job , he has the hat to go with it . After working as a cowpoke , a porter , and various other careers , he lands up as the stage director for a troupe of barnstorming actors . A character actor named Richard Tucker ( not the same-named opera singer ) is quite funny as the troupe's barrel-chested leading man . The troupe's character actress ( Helen Holmes , very impressive in an unsympathetic role ) is attracted to our Hooty , but meanwhile he's attracted to the troupe's ingenue : her name is Mary Darling , which tells you all you need to know . ( Anne Cornwall is bland in this role . ) Holmes spitefully gets darling Mary Darling sacked , so Mary heads back to New York City , where - - with laughable ease - - she becomes the soubrette in a Broadway show . Our Hoot has followed her , and soon he's a spear-carrier in the same production . Film director Edward Sedgwick gives an utterly hilarious performance as the stage manager and director of this stage play . Gibson shows a real talent for comedy here , and some splendid comedic timing . I'll give him extra credit for forsaking his usual cowboy antics , and I'll rate this one .
He gets rid of his little Willie .	' Willie's Magic Wand ' is an early ' trick ' film of the sort made famous by French film pioneer Georges Melies . This film isn't by Melies ; in fact , it isn't even French , and ' Willie's Magic Wand ' suffers in comparison to the French trick films of this period . The films by Melies and his French contemporaries tended to feature tableaux of elaborately-painted backdrops which don't look realistic but - - by virtue of their ornate detail-work - - impress us and draw us into the storybook-like atmosphere of these brief fantasies . In ' Willie's Magic Wand ' , instead of a tableau , we have a crude stage set representing a sorceror's laboratory . The sorceror wears a robe and has a long beard , and there are some cabalistic sigils . The sorceror performs a few crude transformations ( achieved by jump-cuts ) with his magic wand . These are observed with great interest by a boy about eight years old . As there are no intertitles , it's not clear whether the boy is the sorceror's son or his apprentice ; perhaps both . Presumably this boy is the titular Willie . When the sorceror is briefly distracted , Willie snatches the wizard's wand and takes a few whizzes himself , but of course none of his attempts come off properly . The wizard snatches his wand back from Willie , makes a magical pass at the boy , and . . . hey presto ! Willie turns into a girl , with long hair and a long frock . Now remade ( as Wilhelmina ? ) , she takes a quick look at herself and reacts in surprise as the film ends . I wonder if the people who made this British film had any Freudian intentions . ( Probably not , as Freud's writings weren't yet available in English in 1907 . ) Were they aware of the symbolism in turning a boy into a girl by confiscating his wand ? Also , I'm not so certain that I accept the final premise of the movie : namely , that a girl will be better behaved than a boy . One might also speculate about the wizard's intentions towards this girl , who looks a lot prettier than little Willie . ' Willie's Magic Wand ' is VERY crude , and the special effects are laughable by modern standards , but this movie's trickery was probably very amusing for audiences in 1907 , and I'll rate it .
Nearly as funny as ' Rookery Nook ' .	Tom Walls directed and starred in a series of light social comedies written by Ben Travers . These were hugely successful in the 1920s ( and for some years beyond that decade ) , and are collectively known as the Aldwych farces , in honour of the West End theatre that was Walls's and Travers's base camp . The main action of ' A Night Like This ' takes place in a London nightclub which is a front for gangsters . ( I can't believe that any London nightclub would be a front for gangsters . . . not with respectable businessmen like Ron and Reggie Kray making sure that all the nightclub owners stay honest ! ) Cora Mellish ( Winifred Shotter ) is a nightclub dancer who has run up a substantial gambling debt . To avoid having her legs broken ( and losing her livelihood ) she puts up a valuable necklace as security . Unfortunately , Cora doesn't own the necklace : it was loaned to her by her boyfriend Aubrey ( Claude Hulbert ) , but he doesn't own it either ; it actually belongs to his very fearsome aunt ( Norma Varden ) , a battle-axe who would put several of Bertie Wooster's aunts to shame . Into this confusion comes undercover detective Mike Mahoney , played by Walls . While solving the case , he falls in love with Cora . This sets up a triangle with Hulbert , but - - this being an Aldwych farce - - there's never any doubt as to who will get the girl . A large factor in the success of the Aldwych farces was their predictability : audiences wanted stock characters and stock situations , and got what they expected . Here we have thick-ear gangsters , henpecked husbands , silly-ass toffs , and of course a pompous git ( the amusing Robertson Hare ) losing his trousers , thus paving the way for Brian Rix and the Whitehall farces . As a bonus , we get Al Bowlly as the leader of the nightclub orchestra , all of them playing in fine form . The only cast member I didn't like was Mary Brrough ( the British film industry's equivalent to Hollywood's Maud Eburne ) as a shrieking shrew . The entire film is directed very much like a stage play , even to the extent of having the cast take a curtain call at the end ! However , I actually enjoyed this , as it gave me some notion of what it must have been like to see one of these farces at the Aldwych Theatre in George V's day . I'll rate ' A Night Like This ' . Well done all round !
' Au secours ' ? More like ' Aw , suckers ' . . .	Bout-de-Zan ( real name René Poyen ) was one of the very earliest screen comedians to play a recurring character in an ongoing series of short comedies . ( The very first - - although I stand ready to be corrected on this point - - was André Deed , whose screen character was known in Britain as ' Foolshead ' . ) Bout-de-Zan's screen name would translate as " a bit of Zanni " , the latter being the ancient Roman clown who allegedly gave us the word ' zany ' . Unlike André Deed and Will Evans and most other ' character ' comedians of the earliest years of film comedy , Bout-de-Zan usually avoided elaborate make-up and costumes , preferring to portray a normal human being . I viewed a print of the short comedy ' Bout-de-Zan and the Telephone Crime ' from the archives of the Nederlands Filmmuseum , Amsterdam . These archives also have an original 1914 full-colour Gaumont poster advertising this film . The poster's artwork depicts a scene from this film . . . but , oddly , the tableau is drawn to look entirely like a scene from a straightforward dramatic film : a genuine crime story ( which this film isn't ) instead of a comedy ( which it is ) . Perhaps the distributors thought they'd sell more tickets if movie-goers thought this was a crime drama . Or perhaps they felt that audiences would recognise Bout-de-Zan's name and realise that any Bout-de-Zan film must be a comedy . SPOILERS COMING . Here's the plot , such as it is . A hotel room is the rendezvous for Bout-de-Zan and a few friends , including an attractive woman ( Renée Carl ) , and a small boy in an Eton collar ( I hadn't known French boys wore Eton collars ! ) . They've come here to rehearse an amateur play involving an armed robbery . The boy makes a quick call to the concierge on a candlestick telephone , and then the rehearsal starts . One of the actors points a revolver at the actress while Bout-de-Zan chokes her and the boy struggles to escape . However , the boy neglected to ring off the telephone . The concierge overhears everything , and of course she believes a real crime is in progress . A switchboard operator at the central exchange hears it and nearly swoons . ( I was fascinated by a brief shot of the 1914 routing switchboard . ) The hotel charlady , the postman and various other by-standers all come rushing to the crime scene . The postman ( wearing a kepi ) looks amazingly like J . Pat O'Malley , the English-born character actor who was later prolific in American television . Eventually , a gendarme shows up and sets all to rights . I was very intrigued that the actors in this comedy short gave fairly subtle performances . Even in the rehearsal sequence , where the actors ( who are PLAYING actors ) could legitimately overact , they played it mostly straight . The winsome Renée Carl deliberately ruffles her hair just before she starts acting like a damsel in distress : a gesture which wouldn't make sense in real life , but which cues the audience here that what she's going to do next is fake . ' Bout-de-Zan and the Telephone Crime ' is genuinely funny without ever sinking to the level of slapstick or pratfalls , and I'll rate it .
He makes his way to the top .	Reginald Denny , born and raised in England , had a hugely successful career in American silent films ( in which his public-school English accent went unheard ) , playing brash young Americans who were firmly in the Harold Lloyd mould . ' Oh , Doctor ! ' brings Denny even farther into Lloyd's territory than usual , with a thrilling climax that seems clearly inspired by Lloyd's ' Safety Last ' . In the sound era , Denny's career tapered off into character roles and he is now utterly forgotten . During the Los Angeles riots of 1992 , an entirely different man named Reginald Denny was prominently mentioned in the news . At the time , I was intrigued that absolutely none of the news media called attention to the coincidence of these men's mutual name . . . solid evidence of how completely the silent comedian Reginald Denny has now been forgotten . ' Oh , Doctor ! ' is based on a novel by Harry Leon Wilson , who was at this time an extremely popular author of comic novels . . . several of which have been filmed . I've read a few of his books , but I've not read this one , so I can't tell how closely the movie follows the book . It's possible that the climax of this story was originally in Wilson's novel , even though it does seem to be borrowed from a Harold Lloyd movie . Denny plays Rufus Billings , an orphan who was an incubator baby . ( Which would have to have been at least 20 years before this movie was made , since he's now an adult . Did they actually have human incubators quite so far back ? ) He's been in frail health all his life , although it's clear to us that most of this is hypochondria . Rufus doesn't suspect that he's really in the pink . . . and now , out of the blue , he learns that he's in the black ( financially ) . His late father has bequeathed him $750 , 000 . . . but he won't inherit for another three years yet . Unfortunately , Rufus is positive he won't live that long . He ( thinks he ) needs the constant attention of a nurse , but the one he's got - - nicknamed ' Death Watch Mary ' - - is such a baleful influence , she seems likely to hasten his demise . Along come Clinch , Peck and McIntosh , three shrewdies who offer to loan Rufus $100 , 000 providing he signs over his inheritance to them . ( But then how can he repay the $100 , 000 ? ) Rufus accepts the offer . Meanwhile , he's got a new nurse , the beauteous Dolores Hicks . ( I think this name is meant to be a pun on ' dolorous sick ' ) . Suddenly , Rufus has acquired a will to live as he develops a crush on Dolores . The climax of the film is contrived but very thrilling and funny , as Rufus must climb to the top of a flagpole on a skyscraper's roof . Some of the plot makes little sense : Clinch , Peck and McIntosh are hopeful that Rufus will die . . . but surely then his inheritance will be voided , and they can't collect it , yes ? Still , the direction and pacing are efficient , and there are some very funny sight gags . Each of the three villains has a distinctive physical crotchet , and when all three are going at their respective tics in the same shot it's hilarious . There's also a funny sequence in which Denny falls into the hands of an osteopath . I'm not a fan of Mary Astor , but she's attractive and appealing here as nurse Dolores . I'll rate this movie .
Stymie stymies the Unholy Four .	I'm not a major fan of Hal Roach's " Our Gang " comedies - - the so-called Little Rascals - - and I usually avoid the Rascals in any movie that shows them eating . I have no desire to watch their table manners , and most of the " gags " are very predictable : close-up of white kid with dark food smeared on his face , followed by close-up of black kid with white food smeared on his face . So , the title " Free Eats " did not whet my appetite . Fortunately , the Rascals are in good hands here : " Free Eats " is directed by Leo McCarey's unjustly-obscure brother Raymond , and the dialogue is by Roach stalwart H . M . " Beany " Walker . An opening shot of a newspaper informs us that Mrs Stanford L Clark is throwing a free feed for the local kids , to help her husband's political campaign for the mayoralty . Now , there are these four crooks who decide to crash the kids-only party . All four crooks are adult men , but two of them are midgets disguised as babies . The other two men pretend to be the " parents " of the babies , with Paul Fix in female disguise as the mama . Oh , mama ! Over the decades of his long career , veteran character actor Paul Fix had a wide range of roles : he was Liz Taylor's father in ' Giant ' , and he was cast as chief medical officer aboard the Starship Enterprise until he got replaced by DeForest Kelley . I was very impressed with Fix's performance in the 1929 drama ' Lucky Star ' . Here , disguised as a woman , he gives a much more plausible performance than I would have expected . Fix actually attempts a few gestures that are convincingly feminine rather than effeminate . The two midgets ( one of them twice the size of the other ) aren't very plausible as babies . They keep showing off their adult teeth . ( Harry Earles , another adult midget who was sometimes cast as a genuine baby , purposely avoided showing his teeth while in infant roles . ) Both midgets are spectacularly ugly . At least one speaks in a dubbed voice , probably because most midget performers aren't very good actors . ( They tend to get cast for reasons unrelated to acting ability . ) The two midgets steal the jewellery of Mrs Clark and her society friends . . . knowing that , if they're caught in the act , they'll be mistaken for innocent babies snatching pretty objects . The alleged ' father ' of the midgets is veteran actor Billy Gilbert , giving a surprisingly subdued performance . Gilbert typically overacted and often played blustering idiots , but he was actually a highly intelligent man : I suspect that , finding himself here cast alongside two midgets and a female impersonator , he was smart enough to realise he should play it straight this time . What really strained credulity for me is that we see Fix and the midgets ALREADY disguised as a woman and her two babies when Billy Gilbert finds out about the party . Do they live in these disguises full-time ? Hmmm . . . I was intrigued to see good performances here from a couple of kid actors whom I don't recognise from other ' Our Gang ' movies . Dorothy DeBorba ( looking a little bit like Carl ' Alfalfa ' Switzler ) is bright and pop-eyed as the head girl . Sherwood Bailey , nicknamed Spud and dressed as a jockey , is the leader of the kid gang . The climax of the movie is genuinely suspenseful , with Bailey getting into a knock-down fight with the nastier of the two midgets . Here we see an adult criminal ( admittedly a midget in nappies ) trying to beat up a child , and we recognise that Spud is in genuine peril . Bailey gives an excellent performance : why didn't he catch on as one of Our Gang ? I'm never amused when Matthew ' Stymie ' Beard or some other black child is used as the butt of racial humour in these crude comedies . In ' Free Eats ' , intriguingly , young Stymie proves himself a brave and resourceful detective . He's the first to realise that the ' babies ' are not what they seem , and he comes up with a clever method of unmasking them . . . or maybe undiapering them . ' Free Eats ' is one of the more original Our Gang comedies , and this non-fan happily rates it .
Excellent live-action thriller	Several film critics ( notably Leslie Halliwell and William K Everson ) have made detailed comparisons between the 1940 ' Gaslight ' ( made in Britain ) and its better-known 1944 Hollywood remake . The general consensus is that the British version is better . Still , Ingrid Bergman is very beautiful and compelling in the MGM remake , and I especially enjoyed the splendid performance in that version by underrated character actress Heather Thatcher ( wearing a period costume that shows off her very attractive physique ) . Both films have their separate strengths ; how fortunate that we're able to enjoy both , and compare them . This early telefilm of ' Gas Light ' ( a two-word title in the opening credits ) was a live broadcast of Patrick Hamilton's stage play ( brought to Broadway as ' Angel Street ' ) , which was running at the Apollo Theatre in London's West End . On 19 March 1939 , the cast of the stage play went to Alexandra Palace to repeat their performances for the BBC's cameras . This is a stagey production in every sense of the term , but it has its merits . Gwen Ffrangon-Davies is cast in the central role as Bella Manningham , the tormented wife . Despite her patrician name , Ffrangon-Davis was not physically beautiful , but this actually brings plausibility to her performance . As much as I enjoyed the two later film versions of ' Gaslight ' , in both cases the female protagonist was played by an actress of such stunning beauty ( Diana Wynyard , Ingrid Bergman ) that I found it hard to believe she would marry so desperately . Ffrangon-Davies begins her performance with a neatly coiffured hairstyle that becomes gradually more unkempt as she descends into madness . As this is a live broadcast , I couldn't tell if the deterioration of her hairstyle was intentional ( very clever , if so ) , or merely down to the hazards of live performance . In the climactic scene , in which Bella threatens to kill her husband , Ffrangon-Davies wears a gaudy patterned frock that emphasises her appropriately haggard appearance . The villain of this piece - Jack Manningham , the abusive husband - is played by Dennis Arundell , dapper of costume and cultured of voice but far less handsome and suave than Anton Walbrook and Charles Boyer in the later film versions . Whereas Ffrangon-Davies's lack of beauty adds plausibility to her role , Arundell's unpleasant looks detract from his character's plausibility . He has a moustache that looks as if a caterpillar has taken lodgings on his upper lip . As the husband in this stage version is less attractive and much less charming than Walbrook and Boyer in the film versions , it's less clear why Bella ever decided to marry him . Arundell gives a fascinating performance as the sadistic husband , but his cruelty is too obvious from the outset . Walbrook and Boyer were much better suited to this role : in both cases , they played handsome charmers whose cruelty didn't become obvious until the wife was trapped . Milton Rosmer is rather stolid and insufficiently heroic as Inspector Rough , the detective . Elizabeth Inglis and Beatrice Rowe are briefly impressive in their roles as the Manninghams ' servants . The action here is similar to the 1940 film version , but confined entirely to a single stage set . Modern productions of ' Angel Street ' ( a later version of this same play ) feature a clever piece of stage business in which Inspector Rough accidentally leaves his hat on the Manninghams ' table just before the husband returns , then must retrieve the hat without revealing his presence . Regrettably , that very suspenseful bit of business is absent here : it was created during rehearsals for the Broadway debut of ' Angel Street ' , when Leo G . Carroll ( as Rough ) actually did leave his hat onstage by accident ! I'll rate this tele-version of ' Gas Light ' , mostly for its historical value . UPDATE : The actress who played the maid in this drama - - Elizabeth Inglis - - later became Sigourney Weaver's mother . Her husband was Sylvester ( " Pat " ) Weaver , a major figure in U . S . television . On the only occasion when I met Mr Weaver , we briefly discussed his wife's acting career , and he praised her performance in ' Gas Light ' . As he had not yet met her at the time this performance was transmitted , I must assume that he saw a recording of the performance years later . Elizabeth Inglis was a beautiful and talented actress , and I regret that her career was not more extensive . . . although , in her case , this was obviously by choice .
A tantalising glimpse of what might have been .	I saw a beautiful print of ' A Dream or Two Ago ' at the Cinema Muto festival in Sacile , Italy , in October 2006 ; the print was restored in Holland in 2004 , with Dutch intertitles . As is often the case in foreign prints of silent films , several of the characters were renamed : the lead role ' Millicent Hawthorne ' is here named ' Mary ' . . . probably in honour of the actress playing the role . Mary Miles Minter is one of those tragic figures ( others being Roscoe Arbuckle , Wallace Reid , William Desmond Taylor and - - arguably - - Louise Brooks ) whose career can never be merely regarded in its own right , as it's so thoroughly overshadowed by a scandal . Minter was the protegee and lover of Taylor at the time of his murder and the ensuing scandal ; she was also a leading suspect in the crime , which remains unsolved . I believe that the explanation in the excellent book ' A Cast of Killers ' is the nearest we'll ever get to the truth in the Taylor case . Following Taylor's murder , Minter's promising career ended quickly : she was washed-up in silents even before the arrival of talkies , and she spent the last decades of her life as a child-like recluse , a grotesque combination of Norma Desmond and Shirley Temple . ' A Dream or Two Ago ' is an excellent showcase for Minter's unusual talents , as it exploits both the child-like nature of her screen persona and her nascent sex appeal . Officially , Minter was only 14 when this film was made ; actually , she was a few years older . ( Her mother had obtained a younger girl's birth certificate for her . ) As the film begins , six-year-old Millicent ( played by a winsome child actress ) is the spoilt darling of wealthy parents , who - - in classic ' poor little rich girl ' tradition - - give her everything she wants except their time . When some Dickensian criminals cause a distraction in the street to cover their getaway , little Millicent injures her head and is separated from her parents . The criminals take her to a grotesque old harridan ( Gertrude Le Brandt , in an astonishing performance ) , who raises the girl to dance in gin joints . As often happens in real life when a child is lost or abducted , Millicent's parents become estranged ; her guilt-stricken mother devotes herself to charity work . The changeling child soon grows into a beauteous teen ( Minter ) who dances gracefully , and conveniently has no memory of her previous life . But then , one day . . . If you have to guess whether this film ends happily , you don't belong on this website . On the way to its ending , ' A Dream or Two Ago ' introduces some fairly far-fetched coincidences which add to the story's Dickensian atmosphere . But Minter's films ( including this one ) were a huge hit in their day , so this is obviously the sort of story her audiences wanted . She looks extremely beautiful here , showing no trace of sexual self-knowledge while she dances in a scanty white gown for hard-boiled criminals . The image on screen bears almost no resemblance to what we now know to be true about Minter herself . Many of the great screen actresses owe their discovery and stardom to one particular director , but they usually managed to move on from that early relationship . . . so that , for example , Dietrich without von Sternberg , or Garbo without Stiller is still an actress to be reckoned with . In Minter's case , it's truly regrettable that her career couldn't survive the loss of Taylor , the director who moulded her into stardom . ' A Dream or Two Ago ' , directed by James Kirkwood , is solid proof that Minter's talents weren't dependent on Taylor . . . and it's a tantalising hint of the stardom she might have enjoyed at least a few years longer , until the end of the silent era . I'll rate this charming antique drama .
Should have shown more grass , less glass .	I was never an admirer of the poetry of John Betjeman , although I agree with his famous observation about parents . To a large extent , Betjeman defined a certain aspect of England ( and Englishness ) that was already fading away during his lifetime . The BBC documentary ' Architecture of Entertainment ' gives Betjeman an opportunity to wax rhapsodic on one of his favourite subjects : classic English architecture . Also of interest is the fact that this documentary was directed by Ken Russell , at a point in his life when he was still learning the craft of direction , and wasn't yet indulging his obsessions for naked nuns or chorus girls in gas masks . Among the architectures which Betjeman visits here are William Burges's Tower House in Kensington , which makes Betjeman nearly swoon with pleasure . He is less favourably disposed to Sir Edwin Lutyen's Folly Farm at Sulhamstead Abbott , Berkshire , which Betjeman dismisses as too modern . Unlike the erstwhile Poet Laureate , I was very impressed with the Folly Farm sequences of this film . . . however , this was less down to Sir Edwin Lutyen's architecture than to Gertrude Jekyll's elaborate gardening and landscaping . Betjeman reserves his most withering scorn for Peter Womersley's Farnley Hey in Huddersfield , which is indeed a nightmare of glass . I kept expecting some movie villain to come bursting through the glass in a shower of bullets . I wonder what Betjeman would have said about the architecture of Lord Richard Rogers . This television documentary is not for all tastes . If you're a Ken Russell fan , be advised that none of his self-indulgent excesses are on offer here . If you're interested in the architecture and landscaping of a bygone Britain , I recommend ' Architecture of Entertainment ' . In terms of achieving its intended purpose , I'll rate it .
At least they're not bald eagles .	For some reason , this cartoon's title is singular when it ought to be plural : Heckle and Jeckle are both salesmen here , or at least pitchmen . They show up in a municipal park , set up a keester , and start trying to sell hair tonic to the locals , who are a bunch of cute li'l animals . Why any woodland creatures would need hair tonic is not established . Along comes Dimwit ( the moronic hound ) as the local parkie , and that constable bulldog ( did he ever have a name ? ) as the cop patrolling the park . Mayhem ensues , and it's somewhat more imaginative than usual for Heckle and Jeckle , although with one gag so old and obvious that I well and truly cringed . SPOILING THAT GAG NOW : We see a sign announcing a fork in the road , and then - - yep ! - - there's an enormous table fork in the road . Now , see , if I had directed this cartoon , I would have used exactly the same sign . . . but then I would have put a SPOON in the road . Possibly accompanied by another sign : " Fooled you ! " . For some reason , the Terrytoon magpies typically win every round of their battles until the very end , when they arbitrarily lose . That happens here , too , with the two birds constantly clobbering the two dogs , until ( for no particular reason , except that we're running out of film leader ) the tide of battle turns , and the dogs get their revenge . There's a rather weird fade-out gag for the featherheads . One of the better and funnier Heckle and Jeckles , with plenty of violence and easy access to firearms . My rating : .
Neat little tale with a punch .	I saw ' The Jest ' at the 2006 Cinema Muto festival in Sacile , Italy . This short film is a neat shaggy-dog tale : dramatic , with a shock ending that might arguably serve as a ' joke ' punchline . It's a shame that none of this movie's actors are credited ; they all give excellent performances . The opening scene is in Victorian times , 40 years before the present day . We see a young woman , Mary , leaving a note for her husband Dan : he and their marriage are too dull for her , so she is regretfully leaving . In the present ( 1921 , apparently ) we see her now-elderly husband : 40 years on , Dan has never recovered from his wife's decision to leave him . He is a hollow wreck of a man . He lives in a seedy London boarding-house , pining away , obsessively clinging to the delusion that eventually his beloved Mary will return to him . We see the boarding-house's landlady and two other lodgers , both sarcastic young men . These three make no secret of their contempt for Dan , mocking him openly . Eventually , it occurs to Dan to place a personal advert , seeking his wife's return . ( I'm surprised he didn't think of this 40 years earlier . ) We see his three tormentors , sniggering at Dan's pathetic obsession and conspiring to lead him on , as a ' joke ' . Sure enough , the newspaper soon prints a reply to Dan's advertisement , purporting to be from Mary and seeking a reconciliation . ( There was an unintended laugh here - - for me , at least - - when a close-up of the reply advertisement shows that Mary's return address is in Brixton : a London neighbourhood which is now very , very , VERY different from what it was in 1921 . ) Dan writes back to this address and urges Mary to come visit him . The more oickish of the two younger lodgers laughingly decides to pose as ' Mary ' for the meeting . We see the landlady and the other conspirator grinning with approval as this yobbo dresses himself up in long skirts , a lady's hat , and a veil . ( 1921 must have been a good year for transvestites , since a man could so easily conceal his true gender in the female fashions of that time . ) This being a silent film , we don't bother wondering if this young man can feign the voice of an older woman whom he's never met . Dan returns to the boarding-house , and is smirkingly told by the landlady and the other lodger that ' Mary ' is waiting for him in his room . Eagerly , he rushes thither . We see a veiled figure sitting in the room . Dan takes out a latchkey , and locks the door so he and Mary can have some privacy . SPOILER NOW . As soon as I saw the latchkey , I knew what was coming . Sure enough , a moment later Dan emerges from the room , cackling shrilly . What remains of his hair is wild and in disarray . Gleefully , he tells his landlady and the other boarder that at last he has been able to give his wife what he's wanted to do all these long years : he has KILLED her ! ' The Jest ' is an excellent little yarn , although perhaps it would have worked better as either a short story or as a talking picture . Quite as it stands though , there's splendid work all round from the cast , director , scripter and photographer . The only flaw is that the ' surprise ' ending is a bit too obvious : I suspected it before Dan took out the latchkey , and from that moment I was certain of it . My rating : .
Creaking relic still fascinates .	The actor Thomas Jefferson ( presumably named for the U . S . President , who was allegedly this actor's ancestor ) was a son of Joseph Jefferson the Third , an extremely popular 19th-century American stage actor whose lifespan just barely overlapped with the earliest days of movies . Consequently , Joseph Jefferson's entire film career consists of only a few crude silent tableaux , tantalising us with a glimpse of Victorian-era dramatics . This film is Thomas Jefferson's attempt to preserve ( through re-enactment ) his father's most famous role . As my own cultural viewpoint is British , I was astonished to learn that the American actor Joseph Jefferson was the grandfather of the English author Eleanor Farjeon . Like the movie actor Tyrone Power , Joseph Jefferson the Third had a namesake father and paternal grandfather who were also stage actors . Shortly before Jefferson died in New York City in 1905 , he expressed a desire to have his funeral at the nearby Church of the Transfiguration , which he referred to as ' the Little Church Around the Corner ' . This house of worship has been known by that affectionate nickname ever since . In the days before electrical recording , when all performances had to be live , it was possible for a barnstorming actor to earn an excellent living essaying the same role for decades at a stretch , and Joseph Jefferson did so in the title role of ' Rip Van Winkle ' . Washington Irving's famous tale is a retelling of a Grimm Brothers folktale , transplanted to the Dutch Catskills in the mid-18th century but not otherwise changed . I shouldn't be surprised to learn that the Grimms adapted it from an earlier source . This low-budget silent film takes place outdoors but is plainly filmed indoors against painted backdrops . The main setting is outside the tavern of Nicklaus Vedder in the village of Falling Waters . A tavern sign , bearing the likeness of King George III , indicates that this is pre-Revolutionary New York . Jefferson makes his entrance with a small boy riding on his back , several other tots scurrying to keep up with him , and a mongrel following at his heels . Jefferson relies primarily on broad pantomime rather than inter-titles to establish Rip Van Winkle as a lazy ne'er-do-well with a fondness for Vedder's beer and an eye for the tavern wenches . He pauses in front of the tavern sign to pantomime his fealty to King George . The actress portraying Rip's wife Gretchen likewise uses broad pantomime to establish her shrewish nature . Rip bids a fond farewell to his little daughter Meenie and to Nick Vedder's little son Hendrik , and then - - more to get away from his wife than to put meat on the table - - Rip takes his musket and sets off into the forest . The bizarre keglers in Washington Irving's story , playing at ninepins , are often described as dwarfs or goblins . Here , they're portrayed by physically normal men ( probably down to the scarcity of dwarf actors ) but wearing crepe-hair beards that are downright laughable . An inter-title identifies them as Henry Hudson and his lost crewmen of the ship ' Half Moon ' . The long transition of Rip's sleep is conveyed by a crude cut , returning to the same scene from a slightly different angle , with some cobwebs added to Rip , and a new backdrop representing the same forest decades later . Jefferson now wears a beard only marginally more plausible than those worn by the mysterious keglers . When he picks up his musket , it falls apart . When Rip shambles homeward , his clothes in surprisingly good nick , the village of Falling Waters looks much as it did before . . . save that Vedder's tavern now displays an American flag ( with 13 stars ) and a portrait of George Washington . When Jefferson goutily repeats his gesture of fealty to King George - - whom he assumes is still ruler of America - - the townspeople are outraged . The landlord of the tavern is now Hendrik Vedder , grown to young manhood and married to a demure young woman who is the former Meenie Van Winkle . As the actor Thomas Jefferson was undoubtedly well familiar with his father's many performances in this role , I have no doubt that this crude but fascinating film is an accurate re-enactment . . . necessarily performed silent . As such , it serves as a fascinating record of Joseph Jefferson's greatest role . So , this ' Rip ' is no rip-off . Unfortunately , Rip Van Winkle isn't the only creaking relic hereabouts : even by 1914 standards , the photography , lighting , set design and acting techniques on offer here are shockingly crude . More for its historical significance than for its entertainment quotient or production values , I'll rate this movie .
Lewis Carroll would have loved this !	Cecil Hepworth is a vitally important figure in Britain's early cinema , but his achievements were compromised by the fact that he was a poor businessman and poor planner . Prints of his most popular films - - such as " Comin ' Thro the Rye " and " The Joke that Failed " - - were sold outright to exhibitors , causing Hepworth to wear out the original negatives . In order to meet continuing demand for new prints , he was forced to re-shoot these movies in their entirety ! Hepworth probably deserves credit for filming the first remake . Charles Dodgson ( better known as Lewis Carroll , author of ' Alice in Wonderland ' ) died in 1898 , in the very earliest years of Britain's cinema , and there is no surviving record of him ever having seen a movie . ( Dodgson's vast archive of correspondence was burnt by his family after his death , and his diary was censored : there may well have been a movie review in there someplace . ) Yet I'm 100 % certain that Dodgson would have been a cinephile . He was an expert and enthusiastic amateur photographer , he had a deep love of the theatre , and the ' Alice ' books contain several devices which seem more cinematic than literary : Alice is subjected to the shot change , the jump cut , the dissolve , and so forth . Cecil Hepworth's 1903 film version of ' Alice in Wonderland ' - - apparently the first movie version of that oft-filmed book - - was made barely five years after Dodgson's death . Scantly nine minutes long , this crude ' trick ' movie necessarily shows only a few fragments of the novel . The uncredited production designer ( Hepworth himself ? ) has clearly made considerable effort to base the sets and costumes on Sir John Tenniel's beloved illustrations , so it's strange that the central character looks nothing at all like Tenniel's Alice : the actress cast here has long black hair , and her pinafore is nearly ankle-length . Quite impressively , Alice actually falls into a genuine hole in the ground . To show her plunging vertically ( as in the novel ) would have been technically difficult to stage , so we see her creeping through a slanting shaft , in an impressive cutaway shot ( the cinema's first ) ? Some of the special effects are achieved through simple jump cuts , much less flamboyant than what Georges Melies was doing in France at this time . Alice's growth spurt in the White Rabbit's house is amusingly staged by placing the actress intentionally too close to the camera , in an undersized set . I was impressed by one elaborate bit of pageantry in an exterior shot . Alice stands on a broad greensward ( apparently a partial matte shot ) while the 52 members of the pack of cards parade past her , one suit at a time . The print which I viewed had neatly typeset intertitles , but was an acetate print several generations removed from the original . . . so I can't tell if these titles date back to Hepworth's original 1903 production , or were added later . Oddly , the opening title makes a point of telling us that Alice's adventure is a dream : this was only implied in the first chapter of the original novel . More significantly , the dominant figure at the Mad Tea Party is identified in a title here as ' the Mad Hatter ' . This usage is now quite common , but it never appears in Carroll's original novel : nowhere in the text of ' Alice in Wonderland ' is the word ' Hatter ' immediately preceded by the word ' mad ' . The expression ' mad as a hatter ' refers to the fact that 19th-century hatters often developed nervous tics from exposure to the highly toxic vapours of mercuric nitrate . Men's hats in Victorian times were made of felt ; 19th-century hatters cured the felt by a process called ' carroting ' which left a carrot-coloured residue . Since the Hatter in Carroll's novel is never explicitly cried ' the Mad Hatter ' , I'm surprised to find evidence that this popular mis-usage may have been in place as early as 1903 . I wish I could establish the origin of these title cards . Hepworth's production of ' Alice in Wonderland ' is extremely crude by modern standards , and leaves out most of the plot of Carroll's book , as well as the wonderful wordplay . But this film was an extremely ambitious undertaking for its time , and it achieves nearly all of what it set out to accomplish . I'll rate it .
A stagedoor Johnny becomes a chorus girl .	This short film was restored by the Library of Congress from a paper print . Apparently the ' Mr Jack ' in this film is inspired by the character of the same name in Jimmy Swinnerton's newspaper comic feature . But Swinnerton's Mr Jack was a cloyingly cute humanised animal , whereas the ' Mr Jack ' seen here is an all-too-human lecher . We see three pretty actresses in a surprisingly spacious and clean dressing room , backstage at a theatre . Their costumes indicate that the entertainment on offer here is something less than grand opera : one actress is dressed somewhat demurely , but another is in ( by 1904 standards ) a skimpy chorus-girl costume , whilst the third is dressed like the principal boy in a panto : fully covered , but in a form-fitting outfit that makes clear her feminine charms . A middle-aged man enters and starts flirting with all three ma'mselles . He summons a call-boy in a ' Buttons ' uniform , who brings a tray of drinks . After just one drink each , the girls start carousing with the man . ( What's in that bottle ? ) The actresses decide that Mr Jack would make a pretty chorus girl , and he consents to the transformation . One of the girls attempts to fasten a skirt round his waist , though of course it's too small for him . Mr Jack rolls up his trousers - - chorus girls must show their legs , after all - - and he cavorts , to the glee of the girls . SPOILERS COMING . The door opens again , and a middle-aged woman in a severe black dress and bonnet enters . Mrs Jack , I assume . She is carrying an umbrella , and we all know from previous low comedies the real purpose of an umbrella : it's for a woman to hit men over the head with . She complies , to the amusement of the chorus girls . End of movie . What most intrigued me about this film is that two mirrors are displayed on the wall behind the performers . While Mr Jack and the chorus girls are facing the camera , we clearly see the rear portions of their bodies reflected in the glasses behind them . I kept checking the mirrors , in hope of catching a glimpse of the movie camera itself ( or some member of the tech crew ) caught in their reflection , but no such luck . Movie-makers learnt , quite early on , never to dress a set with mirrors unless they're absolutely necessary to the situation , precisely because of the technical problems . Perhaps that lesson wasn't learnt yet in 1904 . . . or perhaps it was , and these film-makers are showing their proficiency by avoiding such reflections . To omit mirrors from this movie set representing a dressing room would indicate that it is , indeed , a film set rather than an actual dressing room . Even in 1904 , evidently , the set dressers knew what they were doing . I'll rate this delightful short comedy , deducting one point because I had difficulty believing that these people would carouse so much after supping only one drink . . . and because I've seen quite a few chorus girls ' changing rooms , but none of them were as spacious , comfortable and clean as the one shown here . Give this movie a perfect 10 if you enjoy watching pretty ladies in skimpy costumes ( and boys ' clothes ) trying to turn a man into a chorus girl .
A little girl with a big voice .	' Sing , Babies , Sing ' is one of a series of shorts produced by the Fleischer studio which followed an interesting format : some typical Fleischer black-and-white animation ( cartoon gags with a musical soundtrack ) would book-end a live-action musical performance by some popular vaudeville act of the time . Generally , the title of the short was also the title of the tune sung by the performer . This one has better cartoon gags than most of the series . We're in some sort of baby factory , where the stork prepares the babies for delivery . We see a cartoon version of Eddie Cantor doing his duck-quack routine ( from ' Palmy Days ' ) and a cartoon version of Ed Wynn wearing a fireman's helmet and driving a fire engine : this is a reference to Wynn's popular radio show , sponsored by Texaco , which cast him as ' The Texaco Fire Chief ' . There's also an astonishing gag , featuring a Jewish baby ( with a big nose ) singing ' Shuffle Off to Buffalo ' with new lyrics . The middle sequence is a live-action performance by Baby Rose Marie , a hugely popular child performer from radio and vaudeville of this period . At this point , she was about ten years old , but performed in baby-doll dresses that made her look younger . Her remarkable singing voice resembles the tones of a grown woman ! Nowadays , the considerably older Rose Marie is best known for her adult performance on ' The Dick Van Dyke Show ' . Fans of her adult performances will be fascinated to catch a glimpse of her here , from her child stardom . Apparently there was some sort of legal problem with the live-action sequences in Fleischer's series : on several occasions in recent years , these shorts have resurfaced with the live-action sequences chopped out ; the cartoon builds up to the entrance of a performer who never arrives ! This is a real shame , as the performers in Fleischers series often did very little other film work , so their performances here are of historical value . ' Sing , Babies , Sing ' is one of the few pieces of film footage of Rose Marie from her years as a child star . I'll rate this short .
Demarest funny , Winchell phony	Walter Winchell started in vaudeville as a performer in Gus Edwards's ' School Days ' act . ( A fictionalised version of this remarkable troupe became Bing Crosby's movie ' The Star Maker ' . ) Between engagements , Winchell wrote and published a vaudeville newsletter , filled with showbiz gossip . He eventually became a newspaper / radio columnist , utterly ruthless in his power , quick to destroy an enemy's career and ( less frequently ) to aid a friend . ( The Broadway revue ' Hellzapoppin ' was trashed by all the critics , yet ran for more than 3 years because Winchell plugged it in his column every single day . ) Although many actors and entertainers desperately coveted a mention in Winchell's column , nearly everyone in show business despised him . ( Ed Sullivan once threatened to shove Winchell's head into a toilet . ) Winchell wisely avoided feuding with his many enemies , aware that such action would only give them free publicity . One of Winchell's few real friends was popular radio bandleader Ben Bernie , and the two concocted a public ' feud ' that was a long-running publicity stunt for them both . Several movies - most notably ' Sweet Smell of Success ' and ' Blessed Event ' - feature fictional journalists who are blatantly based upon Winchell . ' Wake Up and Live ' , an above-average Fox musical , features Winchell and Bernie playing themselves . . . or , rather , fictionalised versions of themselves , designed to make Winchell look good and their phony feud look genuine . In a staged scene , Winchell rattles off his extensive knowledge of obscure nightclub acts while identifying a masked singer after hearing only a few notes . In another scene - equally staged , but funny - a shifty promoter played by Walter Catlett tries to offer Winchell a bribe . Winchell takes the money but immediately drops it into a charity poorbox . Catlett attempts to retrieve the cash , only to attract the interest of a passing policeman . This scene pays tribute to one of Winchell's few genuine redeeming traits : he was active for many charitable causes . ( Winchell founded the Damon Runyon Cancer Fund . ) It's fascinating to see Winchell onscreen , even though he's clearing playing a sanitised version of himself . To see him here , you'd never guess he bullied his daughter unmercifully and drove his son to suicide . Although Winchell and Bernie are prominently featured , the frothy plotline centres on Jack Haley as a would-be radio vocalist and Alice Faye as the singer who encourages him . The sexy and vivacious Faye sings the bouncy title tune . There's a very funny scene in which Haley arrives at the radio station , hoping to audition , when he runs afoul of a sour-tempered studio usher . The usher is played by none other than William Demarest , in his usual mode . It's astonishing to realise that , as late as 1937 , Demarest was still playing bit parts like this one . . . still , he's very welcome here in his brief scene . Demarest assures Haley that his audition will go well , providing he doesn't get mike fright . . . a phenomenon which he then describes to Haley . So , of course , as soon as Haley tries to sing he develops mike fright . There's a delightfully surrealistic sequence in which we see the microphone from Haley's viewpoint , as it morphs into a snarling demon ! There are some lively but irrelevant speciality acts , including a couple of dance routines that would never perform on an actual radio show . Lots of familiar faces in the cast list , and Patsy Kelly is less annoying than usual . The title song is the only good one here . One interesting trivia note : the opening credits of this movie feature two guys from the art department named Mark-Lee Kirk and Haldane Douglas , and their names are stacked onscreen so that ' Kirk ' is directly above ' Douglas ' . I wonder if a certain dimple-chinned actor , just aspiring to a film career at this point , took his screen name from the credits of this movie ? I'll rate ' Wake Up and Live ' .
Erotic , exotic , powerful . . . but not spooky !	It's intriguing that so many diverse cultures have independently developed legends of the witch : a supernatural female , frequently erotic , with powers usually devoted to evil . Most peasant cultures are nominally ruled by men , but the two great mysteries of life - - birth and death - - are controlled by women . A woman gives birth , aided by midwives , in the absence of men . Women prepare a corpse for its journey to the afterworld . It may well be that the power of the witch is merely male fear of women's secrets , women's wisdom , women's sexuality . ' Noita palaa elämään ' , which I translate ( probably incorrectly ) as ' The Witch Must Burn ' , is a fascinating Finnish version of the witch legend . I was surprised that this film is adapted from a stage play , as it features clever use of multiple locations and exteriors . There's nothing stage-bound here . Hannu and his pretty blonde wife Greta are young archaeologists excavating a grave on the estate of Baron Hallberg . ( I cringed at their excavation technique , which involves removing earth as rapidly as possible , in large quantities . ) They seem to be working under the patronage of the baron's son Veikko , rather than the baron himself . One of the diggers uncovers the grave of a witch who was buried 300 years ago at the behest of one of the baron's ancestors . The archaeologists remove the witch's remains , including the surviving scraps of her garments and a leather pouch . Working from these scraps , Greta tries to reconstruct the witch's original garments . Soon , the local peasants find a naked woman in the grave ! Mirja Mane gives an astonishing performance as Birgit , the foundling . She dances naked through the Finnish countryside , her limbs contorting at weird angles and her long dark Betty Page hairstyle flying seductively . The peasants are scandalised . ( One of the peasants looks amazingly like Rondo Hatton ; another one resembles Jane Darwell . ) Birgit is welcomed into the baron's castle by Veikko , Hannu and Kauko ( a comic-relief portrait painter ) , and soon she's wearing the witch's dirndl made by Greta . SPOILERS COMING . There are suspicions that the erotic young Birgit is the ancient witch reborn , but at first these rumours seem to be superstitious misogyny : all of the ' supernatural ' acts manifested by Birgit's arrival could be explained rationally . Gradually , though , as she seduces Hannu and Veikko ( while causing Greta to begin an affair with Kauko ) , it becomes clear that Birgit indeed has supernatural powers . The climax of the film is powerful , raw , elemental and erotic . . . but not scary . This film has many good points , but it simply isn't eerie enough to be a horror film . Despite an obtrusive music track , I was deeply impressed with the photography and editing in this film . There are a couple of bad cuts , but several other cuts are made very intelligently ( including one reminiscent of Hitchcock's ' Rope ' ) , and an unusual montage sequence without any dissolves . I was especially impressed by two jump cuts when Birgit causes objects to vanish : these jump cuts were filmed outdoors , in daylight against a formation of cumulus clouds . . . so the director had to risk that the sun and the clouds might change position between the two camera set-ups either side of the cut . I can't recall that ' Bewitched ' or ' I Dream of Jeannie ' ever had the guts to do an open-air exterior jump cut . Throughout this film , the Finnish locations emphasise the alien and exotic aspects of the story . The peasants and servants , alas , are mere stock figures , perhaps more laughable than the filmmakers intended . But all of the primary actors in this film give first-rate performances . As Greta , Hillevi Lagerstam is sexy and flirtatious without ever becoming implausible . In the lead role , Mirja Mane gives an astonishingly physical and erotic performance , reminding me of Hedy Lamarr's famous nude scene in ' Ekstase ' . I strongly recommend ' Noita palaa elämään ' as an efficient ( and erotic ) example of low-budget film-making . The story , direction , editing and performances are excellent . However , if you're looking for a spooky horror film , look elsewhere . This movie , for all its powerful narrative , is NOT scary . . . unless you're one of those people who think that the female form , in its naked glory , is something to be afraid of . I'll rate this excellent movie .
Poodles Hanneford is brilliant	Franke Darro came from a circus background ( his parents were aerialists ) , and he just occasionally had a chance to show off his circus skills in his film roles . . . such as in ' Wild Boys of the Road ' , when he gives a dazzling display of acrobatics in the last scene of the movie . Darro's short stature enabled him to play teen roles well into adulthood , but eventually his lack of height became a handicap . Darro ended up as the man inside the Robby the Robot suit in ' Forbidden Planet ' : an uncredited role which Darro earned solely because he was small enough to fit inside the bulky robot costume . In ' The Circus Kid ' , Darro gives an excellent performance as Buddy , an orphan who runs away from a a harsh orphanage ( is there any other kind ? ) to join Cadwallader's Circus . The depictions of circus routine and circus people are not very accurate here ( mostly the usual clichés ) , but the film is highly entertaining , and a few gaps in logic do not disturb the story's flow . Darro ( aged eleven when he made this movie ) showed real acting promise in this and several other early films ; it's a shame that his career ended in obscurity . SLIGHT SPOILERS . Charles Gemora , inside an ape suit , supplies a surprisingly subtle performance as Zozo , the circus's ferocious gorilla . When Buddy accidentally gets locked in the gorilla cage , he panics as the gorilla lumbers menacingly towards him . But Zozo turns out to be lonely , and the two are soon friends . Joe E . Brown is impressive here as Kruger , the circus's lion tamer . Years ago , Kruger was fearless . . . but he eventually lost his nerve and has developed a drinking problem . ( Rather ironic , this : in real life , a few years after this movie was made , Joe E . Brown developed alcohol problems . ) The circus's lion , Moloch , is a real man-eater . Fix-it boy Buddy manages to ' accidentally ' lock himself in Moloch's cage so that Kruger will have to recover his nerve and rescue Buddy . Helene Costello is pretty and gives a good performance , as does Lionel Belmore ( who is not so pretty ) . There are many delights in this movie , but the most delightful of all is an appearance by the great circus clown Poodles Hanneford . Born into an English circus family , Hanneford did a clown act on horseback that was not only hilarious but also a dazzling display of equestrian skill . ( Poodles Hanneford is mentioned in the dialogue of ' All About Eve ' , of all places . ) There were no poodles in Hanneford's act : his sobriquet was originally a family nickname . He's marvellous here as the circus's chief clown . I'll rate ' The Circus Kid ' .
Impressive drama deals bravely with unpopular subject matter .	I'm impressed that ' Hail the Woman ' was made at all ; released just one year after American women got the vote , this turgid drama makes an earnest plea against the sexual double standard which judges women's sexual behaviour more harshly than men's . SLIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD . A prologue , set in the Plymouth colony in 1621 , shows a Pilgrim girl sentenced to the ducking stool for flirting with a boy ; the boy is not penalised . Now we come to Flint Hill , New Hampshire in the present ( 1921 ) . Oliver Beresford ( Theodore Roberts ) is a bombastic bible-thumper : what we call in Britain and Australia ' a God-botherer ' . Beresford is determined that his son David ( Lloyd Hughes ) become a preacher , regardless of how David feels about it . As for Beresford's daughter Judith . . . well , Beresford is confident that women aren't important enough to be anything more than wives and mothers . Apparently , God told him this personally . David's evangelical career is compromised when he impregnates Nan Higgins , the stepdaughter of the local odd-jobs man . ( Tully Marshall's character is identified in the credits solely as the ' Odd Jobs Man ' , but a close-up of a cheque reveals his name to be Jake Higgins . The prejudices of 1921 require that he be merely Nan's stepfather , not her biological parent . ) To save his son from scandal , Beresford buys off Nan's stepfather with a cheque . Nan goes off to the big city , to melt into oblivion as one more unwed mother . Judith is naturally dismayed by the limitations imposed upon her by her gender . ( Or rather , by other people's conceptions of it . ) She meets Wyndham Gray ( excellent performance by Edward Martindel ) , an author who encourages her to transcend sexist stereotypes . But Judith is informally engaged to local lout Joe Hurd , who won't put up with such nonsense . Hurd is played by Vernon Dent , a burly performer now remembered solely for comedy roles ( as a second banana to Harry Langdon , and as a villain in Three Stooges movies ) . He gives an excellent performance here , in a role outside his usual range . Sadly , in real life Dent spent his final years in poverty and total blindness due to diabetic retinopathy . Eventually , Judith ends up working at an orphanage . This being 1921 , I expected the orphanage to be whites-only , so I was pleasantly surprised when it turned out to include one Chinese boy . ( And unpleasantly surprised when he's used as the butt for a racial joke . ) The movie makes one odd error here . In a Christmas sequence , we see the orphanage mistress reciting ' A Visit from Saint Nicholas ' . . . but ( in a dialogue title ) she credits Santa Claus with SIX reindeer rather than eight . This is followed by a brief animation sequence , showing Santa with six reindeer hitched to his sleigh . I assume that the animators ( either by accident , or to save money ) left out two reindeer , and the title card revised the poem to match the error . Lloyd Hughes was generally a bland and unimpressive actor . His most famous performance is his role in ' The Lost World ' , where he's easily upstaged by a rampaging brontosaurus . For his climactic scene in ' Hail the Woman ' , Hughes gives a memorable performance as he finally rebels against his father's tyranny . In his performance as the gospel-shouting father , Theodore Roberts has been accused of overacting to the point of making his role a caricature . I disagree : sadly , decades after this film was made , I continue to encounter ' holy ' fools exactly like this man . . . willing to destroy the lives of everyone around them , and firmly convinced they have God's authority to do so . In the central role of Judith Beresford , Florence Vidor gives a sensitive , realistic and intelligent performance . I normally dislike Vidor , who tended to be cast in glamour roles but wasn't pretty enough to justify them . Here , her character's physical appearance is less relevant than usual . This entire film is impressively directed by John Griffith Wray , a director who deserves to be much better known . Sadly , Wray died at the onset of the talkies era , in his mid-thirties : had he lived another ten years , he would surely have helmed several early sound classics . In ' Hail the Woman ' there are several extremely beautiful screen compositions : I was especially impressed by a scene in the New England forest , when Vidor and Dent have a quarrel in front of an enormous uprooted tree . ( I wonder where this was actually filmed . ) ' Hail the Woman ' deals with unpleasant subject matter , but it deserves to be much better known , and I'll rate this ambitious drama .
Soak a bloke ; a hokey joke .	I had read descriptions of this movie at least 20 years before I first saw it ; inevitably , the movie is a disappointment . Actually , the Lumiere Brothers made at least two different versions of this movie , in different locations with different casts . Its title is usually given in English as ' Watering the Gardener ' . This 1895 effort is the earlier version . SPOILERS COMING . A gardener is using a hosepipe to water the garden . A boy sneaks up behind him and treads on the hose , shutting off the flow . The gardener , of course , peers directly into the empty nozzle to see what's wrong . Cue the boy to lift his foot , restoring the flow and soaking the gardener . Spotting the fleeing boy , the gardener catches him and spanks him . This movie is often cited as the very first film comedy , and it surely qualifies as one of the very earliest . When I'd first read about it , I visualised the boy as being about seven or eight years old at most . In this film ( both versions I've seen ) , he's clearly at least twelve : really too old to be engaged in this sort of mischief . . . and spanking a boy of that age is not so much punitive as something else altogether . I was vaguely intrigued that the hosepipe in this movie is made of some material which causes it to kink into sections rather than flex uniformly . Gutta-percha , perhaps ? The Lumiere brothers ' very earliest movies were simply filmed events : documentary footage . Although this movie's action has clearly been staged for the camera , it's still historically significant as an early attempt to tell a story in the cinema medium rather than merely record events . For that reason , I'll rate this crude soaker .
Unemployment , fun enjoyment !	Silent-film star Wallace Reid is ( like Roscoe Arbuckle ) unfairly remembered for a scandal which didn't accurately reflect his true life or career . Reid played clean-cut young men , until his sudden death revealed a history of morphine abuse . This was actually the fault of front-office executives at Reid's home studio , who forced him to keep working under heavy medication after he was injured in a railway accident while en-route to a film location . After Reid's death , the same studio tried to protect its own image by circulating rumours that Reid had led a double life as a secret drugs addict . Reid usually played a brash go-getter , a somewhat more leading-man version of Harold Lloyd . Reid's best director - - they made several films together - - was James Cruze , whose career is direly in need of reappraisal . Cruze's directorial talents were underrated in his lifetime , and he is now unfairly forgotten . Fortunately , Cruze invested his money well . Apparently , in his last years , he lived quite contentedly at Hollywood's periphery and he didn't much care about posterity . In ' You're Fired ' Reid plays Bill Deering , a devil-may-care playboy who proposes to society girl Helen Rogers . Her father Gordon Rogers forbids the engagement , asserting that Bill will never amount to anything . At the stroke of midnight , Rogers proposes a wager : if Bill can stay employed for three months , without being sacked , Rogers will consent to the marriage . In a series of amusing vignettes , we see Bill trying his hand at various jobs of work , and invariably mucking them up until dismissal is imminent . On the brink of being fired from his first job , he takes a second job before quitting the first . . . so that he remains employed yet escapes his first job without getting fired . As he can't hold the second job either , he takes a third job before quitting the second , and so forth . The comedy comes from Bill's widely varying types of ineptitude . He has no skills , so all the jobs he gets are manual labour , and he rapidly develops blisters on both hands . I laughed heartily at a gag when the burly actor Theodore Roberts grabs Reid's hand and pumps it enthusiastically . . . and Reid jumps a foot into the air . Eventually , Bill gets a job at a restaurant as a decorative doorman . At last he seems to be doing well . . . until Helen and her father turn up for dinner at the restaurant . As luck would have it , tonight's the last night of the wager . Helen summons the restaurant's proprietor , and she demands that the doorman serve their dinner , even though Bill has no experience as a waiter . Then , Helen and her father keep Bill busy , constantly ordering him to fetch various items at top speed . It's clear that the Rogerses are trying to get Bill sacked before midnight . As Helen Rogers , Wanda Hawley gives a remarkable performance here . She seems genuinely to be in love with Reid's Bill Deering and to want to marry him . . . yet at the same time she clearly takes a cruel pleasure in forcing him to wait upon her and obey her orders . I was deeply impressed that Hawley was able to convey these conflicting motivations while retaining the audience's sympathy . It's not often that a film depicts a beautiful woman compelling a man to serve her , unless the woman is depicted as some sort of virago . If you want to see a sexy woman forcing a man to wait upon her hand and foot , while she clearly enjoys his humiliation - - and the whole thing played for comedy - - you'll be delighted by the climactic scenes of this movie . SPOILERS COMING . Like several other Reid comedies , this movie veers deeply into slapstick territory . . . yet Reid's hero remains realistic and believable , even more so than is the case with Harold Lloyd . It's no surprise that Bill Deering manages to avoid getting fired before the stroke of midnight . . . at which point he eagerly claims his bride . ( Hmm , maybe our Bill enjoys being dominated . ) There's some delightful supporting comedy by Raymond Hatton as the kappelmeister of an oom-pah band , but Wallace Reid is funny enough that he doesn't need the assistance . The inter-titles are witty too , with some delightful hand-painted backgrounds . I'll rate ' You're Fired ' .
Dirty work at the crossroads .	I've viewed the reconstructed print of ' Curses ! ' . It's a brilliant effort of reconstitution and detective work , a true labour of love . Still , I wish I'd seen an original print of this film , with its original titles . Why ? Because ' Curses ! ' , filmed in 1925 , is a parody of those old-style curses-foiled-again melodramas that were lampooned so brilliantly ( 40 years later ) by Dudley Do-Right and his friends . There's a modern tendency to regard the films of the 1920s as hopelessly old-fashioned and clichéd . But ' Curses ! ' proves that those mossy clichés were already ripe enough to be lampooned in 1925 , which makes me wonder precisely how far back they originated . Al St John ( brilliant ! ) is the Snidely Whiplash-style lip-curling villain who is determined to steal ' the papers ' ( says an intertitle ) from the fair heroine and her elderly father . A handsome swashbuckling hero , who rejoices in the name Rodney Hemingway , is determined to stop him . I regret that I can't identify the actor who plays the hero , whose original billing appears to be lost . He's very nearly as good as St John . At one point , St John calmly ties Rodney to a tree at the bottom of a hill , then gleefully rushes uphill to pester the heroine . No problem : Rodney manfully uproots the tree , then ( still tied to it ) , he calmly trudges uphill , bringing the tree with him ! Of course the villains bring the fair damsel to a sawmill , and tie her to a log on the conveyor belt . ' Now we'll find out what little girls are made of , ' cackles St John gleefully . The only surprise here is that they tie her crosswise , when the cliché leads us to expect her to be tied longitudinally . Rodney Hemingway , of course , shows up in the nick of time . . . and he manages to free her by a genuinely intelligent ploy . SPOILER COMING . After such a great build-up , the payoff gag is weak , so I'll give it away . Hero and heroine confront the defeated villain , demanding that he hand over ' the papers ' . Reluctantly , he concedes . . . and gives them a packet of Rizla cigarette papers ! This is likely to elicit a big laugh from any audience members left over from the last ' Reefer Madness ' matinée . However , the next shot establishes that St John uses the rolling papers for TOBACCO . Sorry if that disappoints anyone . The rebuilt version of ' Curses ! ' is brilliantly funny , and I congratulate the old-time movie lovers who worked so long and hard to fix it up for us . Well done , all ! Ten out of 10 !
No plot : just jokes !	What a delight ! Here we have a Heckle and Jeckle cartoon with no plot at all - - merely a premise - - and it's a fast-paced laughfest from start to finish . That tough bulldog ( did he ever have a name ? ) , assisted by Dimwit the hound , is going through the woods nailing posters to trees : Wanted posters of Heckle and Jeckle . This activity disturbs the real magpies , who are fishing nearby . ( There always has to be at least a superficial justification for the violence . ) They start harassing the dogs , and from here it's all hilarity . The dogs are both naked here ( no cartoon clothes ) , yet they have a remarkable ability to pull nails and matches out of some unseen body cavity . ( Marsupial hounds ? ) I liked one very clever gag , in which the magpies impersonate their own Wanted poster . The Heckle and Jeckle toons are not noted for lush background cels , so I was impressed by the very elaborate backgrounds here . Unfortunately , they're used in the service of one of those travel shots with a repeating background . . . like those awful Hanna-Barbera toons in which the Flintstones keep driving past the same tree over and over , but because the background art is more elaborate here the device is less obvious than if the Flintstones had done it . Elsewhere in this toon , there's an impressive overhead shot of a bridge . SLIGHT SPOILER . We also get that old , old cartoon gag in which someone standing in the fork of a tree tries to saw off a branch . . . and the branch remains suspended in midair while the tree falls into the ground . Much more positively , I was impressed by a protracted gag sequence in this toon , in which various characters keep scooping each other up into sacks or escaping out of them . And there's one very funny and well-animated sequence with all four characters rushing about in utter chaos . My rating for this very funny cartoon is a perfect .
I'd rather be blue . . .	The title of this telefilm set me up to dislike it . I expected ' Make Me a Tory ' to be a Michael Moore-type screed from the left , with a smug liberal setting up a series of Aunt Sally conservatives to be made looking ridiculous . Fortunately , I was mistaken . ' Make Me a Tory ' is a delightful documentary , as well as a showcase for the talents of emerging filmmaker Daniel Cormack . The film opens with Cormack in the centre of the frame , narrating in voice-over while the camera performs a 360-degree pan round him . This is just the sort of show-off manoeuvre that usually raises my hackles : here , however , it actually worked very well and set the mood for what follows . Here and elsewhere , Cormack shows a strong sense of where to place his camera . The film begins with Cormack's confession that he's been committed to liberal politics for his entire life ( which would be all of 28 years ) , but he's now having doubts . Although he supported Tony Blair , Cormack is now disillusioned with Blair's Britain , and curious about the blue end of the political spectrum ( the Tories ) . He's wondering what sort of Britons support the Tory agenda . To his immense credit , Cormack proceeds to interview Tories who are roughly his equals in terms of youth and cultural relevance . It would have been easy for him to confine his interviews to doddering oldsters , thus creating the impression that the Tory party are senile . I was pleased that he didn't do this . There are skillful frame compositions throughout this film , and I was relieved that this low-budget documentary was blissfully free of the hand-held jiggling camera movement that brings a dose of mal-de-mer to so many other low-budget documentaries . I eagerly look forward to more films from this emerging young talent . I'll award a blue rosette to ' Make Me a Tory ' , and I rate this telemovie .
Harold Russell applauds	William Wyler was the fourth recipient of the American Film Institute's annual lifetime achievement award . One of the purposes of the award is to generate income for AFI from the broadcasting rights to a televised edition of the AFI tribute . . . so , the award is always given to someone whose name value is likely to generate high TV ratings . The first three recipients were John Ford , James Cagney and Orson Welles . Wyler seems an odd choice to be the next year's guest of honour ( after Welles ) because most filmgoers and TV audiences had never heard of him . Wyler's name on a movie simply doesn't embody a mystique in the way that ' a Hitchcock film ' or ' a Capra film ' or even ' a Preston Sturges film ' does . ( Hitchcock and Capra were later recipients of the AFI honour . ) In fact , William Wyler has directed more Oscar-winning performances than any other director , by a comfortable margin . . . a record which is unlikely ever to be broken , now that the Hollywood studio system has ended . Wyler was beloved and respected within the industry , and his films were ( and are ) well-known and beloved by movie audiences , even if the average movie fan of today has no idea who he was . As usual for the AFI tributes , this evening alternates between film clips from the work of the guest of honour , and testimonials by Hollywood celebrities whose name value will bring in some TV ratings . James Stewart gets a look-in , speaking about Wyler's career in general rather than about the one obscure movie which Stewart and Wyler made together ( ' Thunderbolt ' , a wartime propaganda film ) . Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn both give tributes to Wyler , and we see a clip from ' Roman Holiday ' : the scene in the church of Santa Maria in Cosmedin , where Peck frightens Hepburn by pretending that La Bocca della Verità ( ' the Mouth of Truth ' ) has bitten off his hand . This scene is a surprising choice to be shown out of context , especially for viewers who have never seen ' Roman Holiday ' in its entirety : we have no advance notice that this movie is a romance or a comedy , so - - when Peck pretends that his hand has been bitten off - - the action is much more startling here than it is in the actual movie . Talking of missing hands : the most moving testimonial of the night comes from Harold Russell , the only actor ever to win two Oscars for the same role . During the second World War , Russell was an Army sergeant whose hands were blown off whilst he was deactivating a dynamite charge . Wyler cast him in ' The Best Years of Our Lives ' as the homecoming sailor who has lost both hands in action . Russell , with his prosthetic hooks gleaming in the spotlight , gives a heartfelt tribute to Wyler . . . then adds some humour with a personal anecdote about an encounter with a woman who noticed that Russell resembled the hook-handed actor in this movie , and ( failing to realise who he was ) she suggested that he should watch the film as inspiration to overcome his own handicap ! Each AFI tribute ends with the guest of honour mounting the podium and saying a few words . I've observed that William Wyler's name doesn't carry the mystique that so many other directors ' names do . One reason for this may well be that Wyler ( unlike Hitchcock , Capra , Ford , Welles , Preminger , Truffaut and so many others ) was a genuinely modest and self-effacing man . When Wyler was signed to direct the 1959 remake of ' Ben-Hur ' , MGM's publicity department blared that Wyler had been an assistant director on the 1925 silent version . . . until Wyler modestly pointed out that his duties on that earlier film ( with ' assistant director ' as his official title ) had merely been crowd control . Wyler continues that modesty here . He tells the story of how he broke into the film business : with no previous movie experience , he walked into the office of Carl Laemmle ( head of production at Universal ) and demanded a prestigious job . Laemmle was so impressed with this young man ( claims Wyler ) that he was hired straight away as a director . The punchline has Wyler saying : ' Thank you , Uncle Carl ' . Laemmle was notorious for padding the payroll of Universal Studios with his relations and in-laws , to the extent that he was nicknamed ' Uncle Carl ' . . . leading Ogden Nash to compose his couplet : " Uncle Carl Laemmle had a very large faemmle . " In Wyler's case , that nepotism turned out to be a good thing . William Wyler has made many wonderful films , and his AFI award is well-deserved . !
