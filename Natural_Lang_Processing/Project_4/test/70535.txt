No deception here , this was just double dumb	Bad acting , pathetic script , utterly stupid tale from start to end . Watching James Russo I couldn't help wondering if he studied every James Caan film ever made or if he just happened to have all Caan's mannerisms : the thrown back shoulders , the cocky walk , the facial expressions ; all were there . His character is in a warm climate with everybody in summer wear and he is never without a heavy leather jacket . How painfully pretentious . This boring murder mystery , which isn't worth the effort of explaining , was so dull I didn't know whether to laugh or go blind . After the first 3 minutes I saw where this junk was headed as Russo stared down a gun wielding punk , told him he wasn't going to shoot , then snatched the piece out of the thug's hand . Later he grabbed the same weapon from a woman's hand by the muzzle while it was cocked . Hello , moron ? Russo's cornball toughguy antics were silly beyond description , not to mention far from the real world of private investigation . Awful .
uneventful , dull , senseless . . . .	What was the purpose of this film ? I suggest it was to make a handful of actors and their producers and director a big payday for doing nothing . Even my favorite actor , Bruce Dern , couldn't keep my interest in this boring movie . A braindead ex-pugilist falls in with a weird woman and her relatives . He starts out as a fix-it man for the woman , and winds up beating a man and getting caught up in a kidnapping scheme . It was so confusing I can't even write a decent critique . If you see this one , my sweet , make sure it is after dark so you can go right to sleep .
idiotic , boring , unbelievable , shallow . A bomb !	I don't have enough room here to list all the faults in this show . It was written as a serious police movie , and came off as a boring , totally unrealistic shoot-em-up . Eastwood played his usual tough , maverick cop part , but not with the flair he has in some of his better films . This junk has been done and done and done . He needs to search for a better script , I know he deserves much better . I think my main objection to this movie was the ending . I expect realism when I pay for a film like this . What I got was a thoughtless mishmash . th of a star .
a raw deal for anyone who watches this turkey	How this gets filmed is beyond me . It has every cliche in the book , several times over . Not even a good action movie , although there was plenty of it to go around . Lousy filming , lousy acting , lousy plot , lousy action scenes . It will go down in my book as one of the most boring , stupid movies I have ever seen . Arnold took the money and ran on this one . , 000 , 000 of a star . Thumbs down and dirty . What a bomb ! !
My hat is off to anyone who can sit through this space junk	This turkey bombed right after the opening credits closed . I couldn't sit through more than 15 minutes of this insubstantial celluloid silliness . Boring , and I mean deadly dull , dialogue , though spoken in English [ for the most part ] , made no real sense at all . Yes , Jane looked great but how long can one be expected to stare at her before that glossy figure becomes commonplace ? Before I exited all I saw the woman do was repeatedly take tumbles and do glamorous close-ups for the camera . Don't bother is my advice .
Too bad if you see	I couldn't stand but 30 minutes of this swill . Lame , utterly stupid jokes used in the most idiotic instances : third grade dialogue with a kindergarten story . Who wrote this crap ? Even Sandra looked like hell , positively fat . Putrid !
Should have called this " The Hurling " . . . .	. . . . because that is what I felt like doing after watching this drivel . This rot was like all other wolfman films - redundant , boundlessly boring , hackneyed , poorly performed , even more poorly scripted , and finally , just plain silly . Why this garbage gets such high ratings is beyond my range of understanding , but to each his own . This junk was no better than the old Lon Chaney werewolf films from the 40's , and they were pathetic beyond belief . This vomitous bilge should be avoided at all costs . Thumbs way , way down .
007 does it again - flops , that is	This was perhaps the worst of all the Bond films I have seen , and I have seen some turkeys . In this one he goes after SPECTER again . When will he finally shut down this gang of toughs ? This time they are going to blow up something important with an atomic bomb if somebody doesn't make a big pay-off . Yawn ! ! So off goes 007 to save the day . Yawn ! ! A huge underwater fight takes place , which I admit was exciting , but the rest of the film was a drag . The fight in the runaway boat was totally contrived looking , and none of the combatants bled a drop . A lousy book turned into a lousy film . Turn in your badge 007 , your race has been run .
I found this to be very boring and silly	I didn't like this mess at all . It was too juvenile for me ; I should have known when I heard that it was animated that I would feel this way . If you like silly comic strip who-dun-its , then go see this one .
not even remotely funny or entertaining	Why can't someone as talented and funny as Robin Williams make a better film than this ? I don't know how to describe this movie - it was just plain dumb and boring . It made no sense to me . Don't bother .
hammy , overacted , silly piece of garbage	I can recommend this film highly to everyone ! ! If you are having trouble sleeping , that is . How this junk got out to the public I can't fathom . It offered nothing in the way of drama ; it did offer , however , some of the silliest ' comedy ' which was not intended to be comedy . At least I don't think it was meant to be so . I expected a realistic movie about gunfighters ; and got a bunch of overgrown boys playing at being Billy Badass . And Sharon Stone ! Gad , this woman needs a new profession . Miscast maybe , or perhaps no actress could do much with such a stupid , overdone role . Gene Hackman , usually one of my favorite players , was simply boring and unbelievable . But again , he didn't have much to work with . This was an idiotic film , I give it 3 thumbs down .
The producers of this horse dung should be incarcerated	Yes , I've seen worse films but this was so bad they had trouble keeping horses during the shooting ; the critters would all run off at night . To say Joe Willie's talents lay elsewhere would be the understatement of the decade . His dismal performance wasn't all that noticeable , however , because everybody else stunk like a week old corpse in a broken icebox during a Texas heat wave . Even Elam , one of my all time faves , couldn't keep a straight face in many of his scenes . There was so much ham in this turkey that if Jimmy Dean bought it he would have to open up a new building to process all the pork . Seldom have I seen a greater collection of grinning jackasses than were displayed in this thinly plotted venture . The soundtrack was interesting but all that rock music never quite dovetailed with the action on the screen .
Standard 80's TV fare	Another in a long line of Jack the Ripper returns movies . Every cornball cliche in the book was in this dull , routine , totally predictable yawner . A big city cop moves to Arizona as a way to avoid stress after a bad incident in Chicago . However , he runs into even more pressure when he gets on the trail of a serial murderer who slays in exactly the same fashion as the notorious 19th century London killer . Gad , what a stupid film .
Should have titled this " The Dumbass Brigade "	What a load of phony baloney trash . No " crack " unit of commandos would want to ever be allowed to act as these jackasses do . Silly macho dialogue , stupid macho brawls , goofy macho action scenes all combined to make for a boring , idiotic , insipid , mundane , moronic , unrealistic aid for insomniacs . It sure wasn't a good war movie ; it wasn't even a good movie . Pitiful attempt at re-doing " The Dirty Dozen " .
When's this old fart going to hang up his gloves ?	I was told this was a good installment in the saga of this dumb pug , and I suppose it was no worse than the others I've seen . Still , it was a case of " been there , done that " . I knew Creed was going to lose , and then Big Rocky step in and clean the ruskie's plow . It was the same stuff as the previous three , just dressed up a tad different . I enjoyed it , but enough already .
Animal House revisited	Absolutely nothing new with this offering . Reminded me a lot of one of the worst films I ever saw , Animal House . Surely real geeks don't act this silly , eh ? The popcorn bit was pretty neat , but this format has been done before . First movie I've seen yet with Kilmer that I didn't enjoy , he is a good player but I simply hated his character in this one .
IL ' cross eyes does it again . . . . . fails , that is	Another bland concoction featuring the boozy , down-on-his-luck read : lazy Tony Rome . While not as goofy , just almost , as " Tony Rome " , I still enjoyed the cornball humor and tough guy action especially from Dan Blockbuster as he waltzed through his big and bad bit . Had to snort at the unseen nod to " Bonanza " , somehow I knew that would pop up . Maybe Lorne Green should have been the lead instead of Snotra , eh ? The only bright spot in this gibberish was the sensational Lanie Kazan and her go-go dancing self . Even an ' in her heyday ' Raquel couldn't hold a candle to this voluptuous doll . OK , she could too hold a candle but it didn't shine with the fervor of Kazan's . Actually , the better title for this turkey would have been " Lady in Concrete " since cement is the wet form of concrete . Or , how about " Concrete Blonde " ?
Hang ' em and the let the worms feast on the remains	Good film about 2 slimy little psychos who murder a child to prove their superiority . A big trial ensues and a big tub of guts , whinebag lawyer pleads for the poor , misunderstood lads to be put in an asylum instead of being given a necktie party . I sometimes wonder how those who pity these slugs would feel if it were their family members that were slaughtered . I say hanging , the needle , gas or the hot seat is too easy : 2 weeks of grinding torture sounds like it would even the score to me . 4 stars .
This film could make one angry	Sandler's character , Dave Buznik , kept getting the short end of the stick in all his business and social engagements . He was simply a nice , easy going guy who only wanted to get by on the job without any ugly entanglements to complicate his life . I wonder how many ' easy going ' types are seething volcanoes inside ready to blow at the slightest provocation . And is this the problem Buznik has ? Buddy Rydell , his counselor , seems to think so as he coachs Dave continually in an effort to rid him of his problems . At first I didn't like the film ; it seemed to be silly and pointless . As it went on I grew to like it , especially Buddy , who had more on the ball than was at first apparent . Decent enough comedy with the scene at the Budda Gardens being one of the highlights . Loved that romantic ending right in the middle of Yankee Stadium .
Bland shoot-em-up	Run of the mill western with a big name cast . Hackman played a rancher who goes after a gang of toughs who kidnapped his wife . He and his buddies were equipped with high tech rifles and scopes which gave the baddies a bad time indeed . The picture was just a series of scenes showing one group of men chasing another group across the badlands with lots of dull dialogue thrown in as filler . I admit the long range shooting was exciting though .
Tedious , unfulfilling , predictable	This was one of those hokey , overbaked dramas meant to bring a tear to the eye . It just make mine want to close in a deep sleep . Not that it was a total boring loser , but the idea of a group of hardened criminals turning into loving , decent folks so quickly after contact with Rover was a tad hard to swallow . I don't doubt that the events were based on fact , I merely feel it was played out in an unbelievable and corny fashion .
Klutzy cowboy falls for killer's moll	Funny western featuring Coop as a 2 bit cowpoke who finds a respect he's never known before when an entire town confuses him for a notorious stage robber . Unfortunately , this made some folks want to backshoot him plus put a posse , an insurance detective , and a cold murderer on his trail with nothing but trouble in mind for the laid back drover . Demerest was amusing as Coop's put upon pardner . Good one .
Determined U . S . Marshal takes rustler to justice	Man accused of murder and rustling is taken on a perilous journey of several days duration . While on the trip to jail , the lawmen were plagued by a lynch mob , the rustler's willful daughter , and the dry , harsh terrain . After finally getting the man to trial , a final surprise awaited the marshal .
The good , the bad , and the stupid	Not a bad western , but not a real winner either . Most of the acting was good , but some of the performers need to go back to drama class and bone up a bit . Douglas and Dern kept the show going with their give and take , although I don't think the real lawmen and desperados actually carried on in this fashion . I think Strawhorn was more of a realist than a truly bad person ; he saw the reality of life and became practical because of his vision . Dealing with 2 faced con men like Nightingale merely solidified his outlook on life .
You can buy a lot with a nickel these days	When two low life dirtbags see an easy score they spent many worrisome hours figuring out how to run the game . So engrossed were they in their greed that they were unable to look at the score with any degree on intelligent planning . Hoffman's character was a particularly odious goof totally unable to consider anything but a speedy , easy job . Crazy film ; thumbs up .
Gang of malcontents plot the overthrow of a nation	A small group of men plan a coup on the government of Mexico and spoil for a good fight . They enlist a former politico as their unwilling leader and he proves to be a fine commander . The renegades suffer several setbacks before finally meeting the enemy at the crucial engagement of the insurrection . A too slow , unrealistic look at Texas independence .
Limey landlord bumps off boarders	A nutcase building manager murders his tenants over a period of several years . When one of his crimes goes wrong , he frames the victims husband , a dufus who sorta deserved his fate . Unable to stop killing , the psycho superintendent committed several more crimes , hiding the bodies around his apartment . The production was slow and stodgy , as are many Brit films , but interesting enough . A better movie of this sort would be Bing Crosby's " Dr . Cook's Garden " .
The James Gang invades the Army	How many of these pro war propaganda movies did Hollywood grind out in the early 40's ? I've seen several , and there isn't much difference among any of them . Here we have the entire Harry James orchestra joining the military in a fervor of patriotism ; the boys just can't wait to fight . This film is the usual " let's all go do battle for God and country " malarkey , spiced up with a generous portion of song and dance . And some really bad comedy . Not to mention some extremely bad acting by Harry himself .
Sugary , lovable boss is unfairly attacked by 3 vindictive , murderous bitches	Comedies usually appeal to me about as much as falling into a snake pit . This one , however , was a little jewel . For my money , the boss made the movie . . . . what a crud ! While Dolly wasn't as polished as the other players , all did a commendable job . Just too funny ! !
Could this have happened during the Clinton presidency ?	Suspenseful thriller about the lengths the toadies of powerful men will go to in order to keep their bosses , and therefore themselves , out of danger and still in control . Reminded me somewhat of the film " No Way Out " . Well done , but the ending was a little shaky .
Never speak to a cop without an attorney present	Very good film showing how the police can go overboard when things look bad for a suspect . A murder is committed during an overnight party at a home and a boy is the prime suspect after he becomes confused over his actions after the party was over . He couldn't remember whether or not he did the crime ; leading to his arrest , the ostracization of the family , and a big court action . Do attorneys really go home with their clients and have dinner with them ?
Tinhorn saloon owner sets Hoppy up	A cheap , lowdown , underhanded , thieving , whiskey and woman peddler tries to frame Hoppy and his sidekick for a stage robbery . He and his bought and paid for sheriff convince a local rancher to press charges and offer a reward of " dead or alive " for the pair . But they made a mistake messing with this steely eyed two gun buckaroo . Clouds of gunsmoke and barrels of lead were expended in this exciting tale .
Big time diamond smugglers get on Jerry's case	Smugglers have a falling out , and one of them high-tails it with the loot . When the gang finds out that Jerry unknowingly received the stones , they pull out all stops to get at him . That should have been easy , but the fools are more inept than Jerry . Of course , along the way Jerry falls in love . An amusing film .
3 people romp through the night trying to unload a dead dog	A dog dies and the owner persuades her daughter's date to bury it in the park . While on his way , he meets a strange cabbie who insists the dog's body can be sold . This is the start of an odyssey through the midtown streets looking for a buyer . Weird characters abound in this bizarre yet funny film .
just another in the action genre	Good action show , but nothing new . This one took place high in the mountains , which showed some nice scenery and such . One man takes on a group of mercenaries , the lead flies , and he kicks butt . It could have been called " Rambo Goes to the Rockies " , it was that pat . It did have one very effective scene right at the first of the film which had me cringing in horror . Not a bad picture , but just same ol ' , same ol ' .
Action all the way	I don't usually like Chuck , but this one hit the spot . I thought the producers could have left out the cornball love scenes , but it still played pretty good . It was totally predictable , particularly the big kick-off between Chuck and Carradine at the end . If you like martial arts , car chases , explosions and hammy , overdone acting then you will go for this one . Funny , Chuck seems to be a crummier actor now than he did when filming this movie .
A boy and his German Shepherd go to Alaska	Good dramatization of the old London novel . After a falling out with his timber magnate father , a young man heads for Alaska ostensibly looking for gold . Along the way he befriends a mistreated dog and is befriended by a mistrustful indian . After many adventures the pair lay claim to an abandoned gold mine and this is where the young man finally realizes the underlying reasons for his journey to the far north . Much of this film is corny and unrealistic , however , it is still an entertaining hour and a half . The Canadian landscape is lush and beautiful .
Is this how Rodney D . got started ?	Obnoxious entertainment wannabe pulls out all stops to get his mug on tv . His equally odious girlfriend and he hit upon a surefire method for his gaining fame which leads to an insane ride behind the scenes of big time talk television . Weird and bizarre but totally entertaining .
A chip off the old block	Never figured Saint Nick for a family man . In this he gives the reins over to his son which leads to all the cutesy pie things with children and love that you'd expect from any holiday family film . Amusing movie with it's own take on Christmas but still just one more show designed to warm the cockles of your heart .
The Japs didn't start WW2	More of the same propaganda junk from the glorious war years . These fabulous flyboys weren't about to let the nasty Nips break them . They were loyal ! They were men ! They were AMERICANS ! ! You gotta love the ending when even the 2 braindead flyers sternly and gallantly marched to the firing squad amid a rousing rendition of " Into the Wild Blue Yonder " . This is the kind of bilge designed to load up the foxholes with patriotic lunkheads ready to give their all for the good ol ' red , white , and blue . Unfortunately , by the time they discover in the real world that it was only a movie it's way too late to go home . Buy , hey , it was a fun movie and worth seeing .
Those dirty , stinking , gutless , backstabbing Nazis ' strike again	Pretty much your typical war drama as a U . S . destroyer and a kraut sub attempt to outmaneuver each other in a cat and mouse duel on the South Atlantic seas . Lots of good depth charge sequences , and the show wasn't bad , but it was also really corny in a couple of spots : namely , the German sailor losing his grip and the U . S . crew member taking the loss of his fingers in a toothy , ho-hum manner . The use of toy boats was a bit obvious , too .
good vampire tale	I can say I liked this one ; and I can't say that about most in this genre . It was a little holey in spots , but overall it was an exciting film . A band of vampires capture a boy and turn him into a vampire . The ending left a lot to be desired , but was still satisfying . Lance Hendrickson made a fine vampire leader .
War , love , and Santa	Smalltown U . S . A . celebrates Christmas with the hope that the boys will return home from the war . One family awaits the return of their eldest son to his pregnant wife while watching fearfully as a younger son prepares to leave for the front . Bittersweet , nostalgic look at a simpler , yet tragic , holiday season .
The Master Race attacks Europe	If you want a real treat read the book . Decent enough film but too long on the home front and not enough on the front lines . Brando was good as the idealistic kraut who believes it takes war to end war . Unfortunately , each new generation breeds a fresh supply of these dupes to keep battle a booming business . I felt much of the dialogue was good albeit thinned down , however the writer still managed to capture some of Shaw's insights into the horrors of war that were apparent in his excellent novel . The story bounced around way too much with little in the way of explanation and covered too many years too fast , but at least we weren't forced to submit to an overload of Dino's silver throated warbling . And just why was L . Q . Jones uncredited ? What an injustice !
If guns were outlawed , would this film be illegal ?	Typical Dean Martin gunfest as he smoothly woos 2 ladies , deals a lousy hand of poker , guns down a few good men , and figures out who a vicious , deadly , sneaky , rotten , heartless , nasty , vile but otherwise okay murderer is ; a tad late , but he does finally get around to identifying the culprit . I had the killer spotted by the fourth death ; the hat was a dead [ grin ] giveaway . I sat during the picture wondering several things : why does Dino always wear that same coat in all his westerns , especially as the landscape appears to be so hot ? Why did Mr . Evers son speak with a decided British accent ? Can a man hold his hands in a prayerful posture in death ? Were double action revolvers around in 1880 ? Do you have to be a stud to play poker , and , if so , what about Old Maid ? Not a bad flic but far from being an award winner . Too goofy and way too hammy acting .
A good vehicle for Nelson , a must see for his followers	I liked the movie , although I don't care a thing for Willie or his music . His band members did a good job as actors , and Slim Pickens was great as the booze swilling guitar player . The scene near the end where Pickens tried to kill Nelson was hilarious . The story never got real emotional nor did it drag around too much , so I considered it good enough .
Love and money don't mix . Never have . Never will .	Interesting re-make of the re-make of the re-make of the original . I have seen the previous 2 efforts and enjoyed both of them more than this one , although I thought much of this film was better done and easier understood . The stupendous looking houses , cars , and period clothes , hairstyles , and dancing did much for creating a roaring 20's look . Good performances by all , but I think Bruce Dern was a more effective Tom than the fellow in this picture . Old money will never get along with new money , will it ?
Never bring a bow to a gun fight	Remake of a rehash of a remake . Ridiculous , completely predictable , not to mention totally unbelievable yarn dealing with 4 bank robbers who kidnap a young boy in order to locate a point in unknown territory . Of course , the parents , armed only with bows and arrows , go after junior in a heroic , but dumb , effort to recapture the kid . Why they never picked up one of the thugs guns when presented the opportunity is way beyond me . And believe me these criminals were stupider than Moe , Shimp , and Larry . I doubt they could have knocked over a lemonade stand and gotten away . . . . maybe one brain could have been rounded up among the four . All this negative opinionating doesn't mean I didn't like the tale : it was exciting and the scenery was something else . It reminded me of " River Wild " , only not nearly as good .
Wicked widow weaves web , woos , weds & wastes	Had this film been a submarine it would have sunk in shallow water from all the holes . This woman was so psychotic she couldn't have hidden her condition from a half witted , blind , ten year old . She had more problems than a certain gentleman driving a white Bronco down an L . A . freeway . All her victims sported a pair of dead giveaways that any first year morgue attendant could spot from across the street . Hello ? Do the authorities know how to spell autopsy ? Aside from these glaring holes the size of King Kong's hemorrhoids it wasn't a total wash-out . Decent enough performances but the pratfalls were strictly amateurville . After the first 5 minutes I saw exactly how the thing would end . . . . and it did . This picture reminded me a lot of 2 other movies in this genre which were much better : " Black Widow " and " The Hand That Rocks the Cradle " .
Could have named this " The Art of Charlie's Angels "	Everybody knows Wesley is a bad mother , right ? Not this bad though : some of the jumps he made would have bought the black 007 a bevy of busted limbs . As in all spy shows I was totally baffled as to what was going on : but who cares , I like watching Wes work . Plenty of excitement , blood , guns , karate and babes for any action nut , but I've been there / done that with Art of War . Even the double whammy ending has been done .
Decent enough comedy	I got a few laughs out of this one , more than a lot of other so called comedies . The big ship was a knockout and getting to see a lot of it's scenery was fun : as was getting to see some of Dyan Cannon's curves . This wasn't the height of Lemmon's and Mattheau's career , but it wasn't a total dog as some suggest .
How about renaming this one " Gimme Mick "	Fairly good look at the Stones on tour . I disliked the way the concert footage had the camera focusing on Mick most of the time . There were other musicians on stage with him , why not spread the camera around a bit more ? There was a little too much of the camera zooming in on someone who either just sat there and stared or mumbled something that was hard to hear . I also felt there could have been less panning over the crowd of stone heads , and more time given to the various entertainers . I would particularly have liked to see more of the Jefferson Airplane . However , the open murder of a man by the Hells Angels near the end was graphic and brutal , clearly showing what a mistake it is to put oneself in a crowd of rowdies high on dope and alcohol . This film was more a tribute to Mick Jagger than a commentary on the rock / drug culture of the late 60's . For all the faults I listed , I still consider the film to be well worth watching .
I just can't see Chevy Chase in this role	I'll start out by saying I've never seen Daryl Hannah looking better . Having that out of the way , I will say this film wasn't particularly funny nor was it anything more than an average picture , but the special effects were special indeed . Neill was fine as the C . I . A . goon intent on cashing in on someone else's misery . All things considered , I still think being invisible would be a plus . Hannah gave all the good reasons .
Master gunslinger takes on thieving gang	Absolutely ridiculous , totally entertaining ultra-spaghetti western featuring one of entertainments greatest , and ugliest , bad guys - Lee Van Cleef . Here he plays one of his rare good guy roles as Sabata , the cool gunhand who toys with a huge gang , none of whom could put a slug in him . He , on the other hand easily shot and killed them by the bushel basket , using guns , dynamite , and the blade . If you like offbeat westerns with clouds of gunsmoke , and a ton of lead then this is the one for you .
What would the Bard think ?	Good , but the Mel Brooks re-make outshone this old bird front to back . It was funny to hear Robert Stack's 40's voice compared to the more natural style he used later in his career . As always Benny is a riot as were a couple of the stupid Nazi officers . Worth seeing .
Who could get angry with Santy ?	A man , claiming to be Santa , moves to a new town and instantly antagonizes his neighbors . Even though he is popular with the kids and does many good deeds , the complaints cause trouble for him with the police and a local politician , a woman who harbors a deep hostility for the old gent . " Santa's " true identity is eventually revealed and the lady must make a few important decisions . Good film for the holidays .
Serial killer has the cops frantic	When a cop loses his memory while in the middle of a murder investigation he must turn to a lady psychologist for help . As his memory returns he begins to piece the parts of the crime together , zeroing in on the killer whom he believes is a member of the police force . The life of the psychologist is endangered after the murderer is thought to have been killed by the police . Good drama with a surprise at the end .
Heaven , my eye . . . hell wouldn't even want this malicious hussy	Pretty good drama featuring some of the top names from the good old days of talkies . A young Vince Price looked different from his later films where he mostly played loonies in old houses . Or so it seems . No problem identifying Chill Wills goofy mug . I really liked the locales , especially the beautiful old southwest home and the cabin at the back of the moon . Arizona and Wyoming provided some great backdrop for the otherwise ugly goings-on . Why two men fell for this doxy is pretty apparent : she was a beauty . However , I couldn't believe how easily she led her fiancee around by his nose ring . There's only so much a pretty face can do before the pussy whipping gets old . After all , as Jane Fonda neatly put it in " Stanley and Iris " : " beauty fades " .
May be best not to meet anybody	When a magazine editor comes into contact with a strange woman he has no idea his life and liberty will soon be jeopardized . When the woman winds up dead the man's boss starts a large scale manhunt for the killer in order to further his magazine sales . Or does he have an ulterior motive ? Lots of suspense as the editor plays a cat and mouse game with a group of deadly conspirators .
Bat 21 in a different country	Very exciting film , giving the viewer nothing new in the way of a story . I was on the edge of my seat all the way through especially during the SAM attack on the airplane . Hackman gives his standard fine performance as the Admiral willing to scrap his career for one of his men , and Wilson does a commendable job fighting and running across dangerous ground . Thumbs up .
Scuba divers encounter E . T .	Underwater salvage crew takes on a government job and runs afoul of a hurricane , damaged equipment , and a rogue Navy Seal . Then they meet spacemen . I saw the cut version so to me this was just an average sci-fi adventure with lots of tension and your standard high voltage dialogue . Adequate , but no big deal .
Group of Brits get hitched	Oddball comedy featuring an eccentric assortment of folks who keep popping up at weddings , each looking for a mate . Hugh Grant , as usual , was delightful , and the rest of the cast were excellent . A funny , offbeat , and well done film .
Amusingly goofy	Nonsensical spoof never intended to make sense but merely to entertain - which it did . Whereas I didn't find it rolling in the aisles funny I did get plenty of grins ; I especially liked the plays on words and all that mask ripping at the end was a howl .
Standard double cross stuff	Good film , but the same old government cover-up of important V . I . P . drug dealers ; double cross of the field cop by his friends ; danger from street punks ; gunplay and overdoses ; good guy cop doesn't know who to trust or where to turn so starts playing both ends to the middle . Nothing new , but go ahead and watch . . . . it was still fun .
Never trust a drunk	Good western with Quinn playing a man bent on revenge who lives on the shady side of the law . After coming to a strange town his life is changed completely and he must come to a major decision concerning his future . Lots of good gunplay , bad guys , and , of course , the love interest .
Unreality at it's highest point	I love this kind of film : funny , touching , and oh , so romantic . And so totally out of touch with the real world . But so what ? It's a movie . . . . and a pretty good one at that . Perhaps if I watched this film enough I , too , would find a small portion of passion in my life . Perhaps , but most likely , I would remain a hopeless cynic and merely murmur , " ah , love , so romantic , so wonderful , so utterly unattainable " .
He'd rather kill than study	Insane college student figures out a way to get his grades the easy way . Murder . Everything goes his way as he outwits the police , fools the university staff , and pins the rap on his dopey partner . However , all is not as it seems and some surprises are in store for the viewer . Interesting little thriller , with some black comedy thrown in the mix : makes a guy wonder if such a rule could exist in a university without causing just such an incident .
Gold and injuns don't mix	When 4 men follow a woman into redskin country to help rescue her husband they find trouble within their own ranks as well as having to face a deadly threat from the savages who claimed the land as their own . Only a fair western but it did carry a good finale as the rescuers fought their way across a ruggedly beautiful Mexican landscape .
True love never runs smooth	As Lawrence Welk would have said " wunnerful , wunnerful " . Here is a different take on an old tale , and a well done one . Most of the film concentrated on the problems of the Prince and his family instead of the other way around . The fairy godmother was played very unusually in that she was so imperfect . . . . and she had a dog . Great costumes and props , and lush color throughout made for a spectacular event . Love is simply grand !
dead soldiers go at each other	I usually avoid Van Damme's movies . He is a turkey actor who makes really bad choppy socky films . But this one was pretty good , not great , but watchable . The government brings back to life a group of dead Viet Nam soldiers and turns them into bionic warriors . The plot thickens when 2 of the soldiers don't get along because of problems they had when alive . Good action and fight scenes keep the film moving right along at a good , if predictable , clip . Worth seeing .
Grumpy old man becomes pack leader	A middle aged man , Robert Jordan , set in his ways , takes on a boy scout troop after his predecessor leaves under duress . Jordan takes on the pack mostly to learn what the boys like so he can revive his flagging radio program which is losing it's appeal to the younger set . He has a rough go at first with the boys , especially so with Mike , an 8 year old who forms an attachment for the older man which is anything but reciprocated . Do things work out for Jordan and the scouts ? Check out this entertaining and amusing film from the old days .
It's party time	Funny tale dealing with a pack of drunken losers forced to go to a de-tox center because they can't control their lives . Well done throughout and , although I thought it was funny on film , I have no patience with these folks in the real world . As usual Sandra was the most .
Not the best RC ever made	" Notting Hill " , " My Best Friends Wedding " , and " Sleepless in Seattle " is what this comedy wants to be but can't . Whereas I didn't yawn all the way through , I never did get on the ' love ' bandwagon and have a joyous , romantic journey . I believe the opposite sexes can and do act in this fashion , but to have it play out in such a perfect setting with these two ' professional ' lovers was a bit overdone . The dialogue was sometimes corny beyond description , and all the scenes where the girl tries to lead the guy got to be a little tedious . Nothing against the performances , they were fine : I merely felt the writers were reaching to far for a tale of unrequited commitment against seemingly overwhelming odds . Besides , I knew 5 minutes into the film exactly what the outcome would be . . . . . and it was .
Drunken singer sobers up and gets religion	Good show with fine performances by all . Filmed just south of Dallas , the countryside was perfect for the texture of this film which deals with a man seeking a new life in the bedrock of fundamental Christianity .
Return of the Godfather . . . . sorta	Interesting , but not particularly amusing comedy involving a scam within a scam within a scam ; maybe one scam to many but who knows ? Well done , but nowhere near an award winner or especially relevant . I fail to see the appeal of Brando as " actor God " : seems to me he is just another man earning a living in Plasticland .
2 good reasons to avoid parenthood . . . . and the holidays	Were these 2 argumentative crumb munchers cute or a gargantuan pain in the butt ? Cute and funny show not intended to be anything but what it was - mindless Christmas entertainment . My Christmas wish is to never have kids , especially a pair like this duo .
Trouble on the Texas-Mexico border	After the Civil War , a group of cowboys take a herd of cattle to Mexico in exchange for 50 prisoners . They must battle heat , lack of water , each other , and a tribe of ornery , warlike redskins to reach their destination . Good shoot-em-up .
Sensational swordsman slashes , stabs , sticks , scars , socks , snips & skewers Caesar's scummy scallywags	I don't generally go for sword fighting movies , but this one was a winner . Good battle scenes and even better " to the death " contests showing some real blood baths . Of course , there was the political infighting which led to the final confrontation between an odious ruler and his slave . First rate .
' Ol boy falls for sweet thang and writes a story	Way back when women knew their place and were kept in it { were it still that way ! } , a married man gets the hots for another woman and the fit hits the shan . That's what happens when a man's eyes roam from the marriage bed . Unfortunately , his many problems were not lessened by this affair but merely intensified . And all in the name of this most elusive and unattainable of all things . Get a load of the queen ; she was creepier looking than any vampire I've ever seen . Jolly good .
country singer falls in love with country girl	I didn't think I would like this one , but got fooled . George Strait gave a good performance as a burned out country singer who meets a girl at a bar . Romance blossoms , but they get on the outs with each other . Meanwhile , Strait is having troubles on another front . His manager wants him more flashy , while he wants to be just a good ol boy . Plus , one of his roadies is trying to use his band as a stepping stone to the big time . The show provides a mushy , tear jerking ending for all the lovelorn out there .
Hooligans ride their boards to . . . . . where ?	A group of teen-age punks with a burning need to ride a piece of wood with wheels run rampant through L . A . They let nothing get in the way of their " sport " which consisted of whizzing around on their boards getting low and grabbing air . Many of these kids came from broken homes and , having no supervision at all , were turned loose to waste their lives ' sidewalk surfing ' while harassing others who came into contact with them . Some of these little thugs grew up and did alright ; others formed their own broken homes , giving life to a new generation of castoffs , while one did a stint in the pen . Excellent documentary showing how lives can become a disaster when parents show no interest .
Funnier than the original	Had a great time watching this one . Lots of blues music and snappy dancing , the music being performed by many of the blues leading players and legends . And that car pile-up . What a riot ! I couldn't stop laughing all the way through ; loved the way Elwood parked his car . Funny , funny picture .
Fly fisherman boozes it up and chases broads	Excellent film dealing with the life of an old man as he looks back over the years . Starting around 1910 , he reminisces about his boy and young adulthood ; his family , friends , romances , etc . Very nostalgic piece with a bittersweet finale . . . . " all things in life come together as one , and a river runs through it . And that river haunts me . " Worth seeing .
good western about greed and good men gone bad	Convicted thief does time in a prison for a bank robbery . When he finally gets out he goes back for the loot and smiles when he finds it still there . He is being chased by the holier than thou sheriff who is determined that the thief will not enjoy his ill gained treasures . But things don't work out the way either of them thought it would . Fine western . Douglas and Fonda made a perfect team .
Made me wonder if this could really happen	A stressed out business man turns the tables on a pair of professional car boosters . After getting the upper hand on one of them , things get out of hand as the executive's occupational problems make him more and more unstable . Torture turns to thoughts of murder as the scene becomes too complex for the man to deal with and he begins to lose touch with reality . Very exciting , well made film with loads of nail biting tension .
You really can laugh at the mob	This did for crime what " Not Another Teen Movie " did for school . I laughed all the way through as 2 inept gangs warred with each other and among themselves . An unsubtle comedy using overt jokes and gags that kept me rolling all the way . I suppose the biggest gag in the entire film was that time never seemed to go forward leaving the characters trapped in the 30's .
Hard to describe this one . Yes it is .	Engrossing film dealing with several people either in the music business , a hangar on , or a relative . The story bounced in and out of their lives most times in a dramatic way but with an occasional surprise laugh . Hard to briefly describe the action because of all the jumping about and the multiple little dramas going on , but I can say it was well written with some great dialogue .
Sometimes religion is a killer	All I know of the Parkers is what I saw in this film so I have no idea what the ' real ' story is . If these folks are anything like the characters portrayed here then they are a pair of real donutheads . What were these 2 dunces thinking ? That God is some kind of celestial insurance agent who remedies every hurt and care of anybody the moment they ask ? Hello ? If this were true no believing Christian would ever have one single woe . I don't go for them being thrown in jail because of the misery this would cause the other children , but they deserved to beaten over the head for being so clueless . Watch church TV and see that the world is full of pathetic losers just like these two . It's scary .
It's better to live alone	Excellent film dealing with one man's obsessive loneliness . He wants to remain apart but can't seem to do so completely . Taking on a room mate worked out pretty well until his feminine side broke through and he started getting to curious about his new partner who turns out to have a very unsettling past . 4 stars .
Convict and boy drive across the Lone Star State in 3 different cars	What a great film . Unusual to see Eastwood taking a back seat in a movie : Costner took the lead and did a good job with it . In fact , all the players were good , maybe because they had such a fine production with which to work . I can see why Costner's character wound up in the pen ; he made no effort to travel incognito - pretty stupid for such a high I . Q . Speaking of opacity , how did that igmo pulling the airstream get to be a Texas Ranger ? Are the police actually that brainless ?
Rugged rifleman rides roughshod over unruly rednecks , riles raunchy rancher , riddles rascally rustlers	A gang of horse rustlers take on an ornery rancher causing him to hire a psychotic assassin to terminate his tormentors . Brando was superb as the insane Robert Lee , and Nicholson turned in his usual fine performance as the enigmatic gang leader . Was Robert Lee really a bad man for taking out the thieves , or were the rustlers merely " boys being boys " ? Excellent western with maximum excitement as well as several good laughs .
funny look at the life of the mop tops	This was a funny look at the fab 4 as they run from girls , do a recording session , and try to keep up with Paul's wayward grandfather . Lots of Beatle music and zany antics kept the action moving along nicely . It wasn't long on story , but played well anyway . Fun movie .
man is kidnapped and tortured by paranoid woman	A woman who was tortured by a fascist regime never got over the fear it instilled in her . Years later she thinks she recognizes her chief interrogator as he visits her home . She ties him up and begins a psychological interrogation , trying to get him to admit his guilt . Her husband waffles back and forth between believing the man is guilty and then wondering if he is innocent . The viewer is left wondering about the man's guilt or innocence until almost the last frame . Intensely dramatic , I was unable to take my eyes off the screen . 5 stars .
Kids are so untrustworthy	Sociopathic young girl resorts to murder to get what she wants . Her paranoia caused her to commit another violent act , which led her mother to making a dramatic decision . Great movie with a smashing finale ; much better than the original . I usually consider Carradine to be a 10 cent actor , but he played the moronic handyman to perfection .
Did Walter Cronkite act like this ?	Excellent movie about a big media firm and the goings on both on and off camera . Covering several years , the film centers on 3 upwardly mobile , young hopefuls , all striving for their place within the corporation . Well written dialogue , flawless acting , and a riveting story made for 2 hours of solid entertainment .
Good spooky chiller	This was a been there , done that film but I still wound up enjoying it immensely . Lots of creepy sound and sight effects , good performances , and a long , luxurious buildup to finding the solution to the wife's weird problems . My only gripe is the big finale : a little trite but done well enough as to not ruin the picture .
TV station gets a hairy helping hand from the animal kingdom	One of the funniest comedies I've seen yet . What made this so was the interplay between Wally Cox and Joe Flynn [ one of my favorite comics ] . The bit on the building ledge was too much and had me rolling . The bellowing company prez was well played by Harry Morgan , a man I well remember from the early 60's sitcom " Pete & Gladys " where he played the put upon hubby , Pete Porter . John Ritter performed the snobbish , suck-up nephew to the hilt who , of course , gets his just payment in the end . 4 stars .
cute romantic comedy	I loved this show . The acting was flawless , and the story was funny , believable , and lovable . A woman goes after an old boyfriend who is about to be married . She didn't want him before the engagement , but went to all kinds of troubles to win him back before the marriage could take place . With every shananagan she pulled , she dug herself into a deeper and deeper hole . Finally , her antics were found out causing bitter feelings . The movie remained light hearted all the way through , giving me great bursts of hilarious guffaws . Diaz and Roberts were perfect together , great comedic actresses . See this one .
Enjoyable all the way through	Thornton was very believable as abused killer Carl Childers . J . T . Walsh was even scarier ; a chilling sociopath full of himself and an endless river of b . s . Although this was a solid drama all the way I still got some good laughs at Carl's expense much as I did with Hoffman's character in " Rain Man " . Carl's humming noises at the end of his sentences , the frog throat , and the redundant ' alright then ' cracked me up at times . I also roared with glee as the little boy fired everything but the kitchen sink at the whinny drunk , Doyle Hargraves . Why did his mother need a man so badly that she would take on this loud mouth , enraged , drunken loser ? And why did Doyle's buddies always return for another dose of his psychotic rages ? While I'm asking questions : why are we thrown the old " aren't homosexuals just sweet , nice folks " chestnut once more ? Really sick of that one , however Ritter did do a fine job with the character . No way would the 2 short chops with a mower blade do the damage Carl described over the phone . 5 stars .
tragic , yet funny ghost tale	A man is murdered by a mugger and his ghost comes back to his girlfriend . She can't see him , but another woman can ; this woman convinces the girlfriend that he is there in spirit . One of the most tender and engrossing films of the 80's followed . The ending is guaranteed to soften the hardest heart . 5 stars .
