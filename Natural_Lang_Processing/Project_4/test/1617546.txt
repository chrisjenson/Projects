How Low Can You Go ?	This is a movie without any redeeming values . Bad script , bad acting , bad cinematography , even bad foley work - - there's one scene in which the lead mafioso is pouring a couple of glasses of wine and it sounds like the mike is taped to the inside of a toilet bowl as someone is urinating into it . Another scene , inside a network newsroom , echoes . In the scenes where people are sitting inside cars , talking , they all shout . The makeup is awful . The public relations man's girlfriend sits in a darkened bedroom wearing a couple of pounds of mascara . There is so much to this movie that is awful , from the sheer brutality and stupidity of the characters to the script in which people keep screaming about respect , to some fat mobster who keeps cackling in the background that I can recall no movie which approaches this in its stupidity . Even the works of Ed Wood is suffused with good intentions . I suppose there is some purpose to this movie : if you want some one to never speak to you again , recommend this movie .
Isn't a Comedy Supposed to be funny ?	Lloyd Hamilton and Bud Duncan made up a comedy team in the teens as ' Ham and Bud . ' Ham was the big fat one , looking a little like a seedy Oliver Hardy with a bad walrus mustache , and Bud looking a lot like a seedy adult Micky Rooney . They played a couple of vicious tramps who wandered into random situations involving lots of violence . This was supposed to be funny . It usually wasn't . This one is not only unfunny , it's downright offensive . Here Bud gets covered in blackface and dressed up in what is supposed to be Maori gear , so that Ham can pretend to be an explorer and collect money from giving lectures . Awful .
A movie of a statue	I would suppose that an American in a theater in 1898 , watching a film program of short films from around the world , would be caught up in the excitement of a film of the Statue of Liberty . If you stop and think about it , though , what you have here is a film of a statue . This differs from a photograph of the Statue of Liberty in that . . . . what ? There is no movement , just the Statue of Liberty , right profile . No people , no flags rippling in the wind , no seagulls flapping past to mar the unmoving image of the Statue of Liberty . This goes on for thirty seconds . Andy Warhol , look out .
The Brains of a Dope	A married trapper wins the heart of an Indian maid and is married to her . After the wedding night he returns to his other wife and family . The Indian discovers this bigamy and determines to kill him , but seeing the love he has for her daughter , she jumps off a cliff instead , hoping to meet again in the " Happy Hunting Ground . " That silly plot sums up the basic problem of this movie , which survives in an excellent tinted print . The exteriors , shot in Fort Lee New Jersey , are fine . The interiors are clearly flats . Besides the problems with the plot , the acting , while clearly Griffith-influenced - - by this stage , what American film was not ? - - is broad to just shy of comedy ; and the direction has a fairly long sequence in which the trapper comes home and cuddles his his daughter and neither of them mention the Indian in the room , even though the daughter fully knows she is there .
Syrupy	A treacly Happy Harmonies cartoon from Rudolf Ising as a bunch of childish , anthropomorphic bees spend their time , when they are not making honey , in cavorting with each other around Disney-fied mushrooms , until a big black spider with pink spots threatens their idyllic existence . This is one of those cartoons that exists only to be made fun of , and when Tex Avery showed up at MGM in the early 1940s , he skewered the entire genre with the opening to his first Screwy Squirrel movie . Scott Bradley's music is right in there . Although he would become the second best conductor of cartoon music when working for Hanna , Barbera and Avery in the 1940s , he gave ' em what they asked for with close harmony and variations on " Flight of the Bumblebee " . Of more historical interest is that the early sections in the honey . . . . well , call it factory - - looks a lot like the beauty shop scenes in the 1939 WIZARD OF OZ . I suppose that's what they thought the kiddies wanted . The dopes .
Join the Navy and See the Snakes	By the middle of the 1920s , Lloyd Hamilton was one of the most accomplished screen comedians working . Chaplin said he admired him . Charley Chase ( who had directed Ham in a few pictures about 1920 ) said that when he needed to think of a gag , he would ask himself what Hamilton would do . But first he had to be bad , and here , working in a short subject for future great director Marshall Neilan , he is bad . Oh , the pure slapstick events , the falls and so forth are executed competently , but there is little sense of any character in this comedy about a sailor who drinks too much . The gags are relevant to the situation : his mates torment him with snakes - - making him think he has the D . T . s , but mostly it is fast and furious in the Keystone mold , without any of Keystone's fine editing . Worthwhile for completists and for people who like to wonder how he got from things like this to masterpieces like MOVE ON and THE MOVIES .
a view of girders	A close-up examination of the girders of the Eiffel Tower in Paris . The view is varied somewhat by occasional glimpses of buildings , warehouses in the early sections and at the end of this two-minute film , ten seconds of the buildings surrounding the Champs de Mars .
High Concept , Low Comedy	Joe Rock was a fine producer of comedies in the late silent era . He knew how to let his performers work and the results showed . So when he came up with a bad idea , it was really a stinker . The bad idea here is this : people laugh at fat guys . People laugh at comedy teams . So let's take three enormously fat bit players and make a team out of them . Then he surrounded them with good production values and came up with . . . . well , this . The Three Fatties ( also known as " Tons o ' Fun " ) play three enormously untalented performers in a cabaret . One of them puts on a grass skirt and dances the hula . Another pretends to lift a piano attached to a rope and pulley . They are so bad that the audience rebels and soon there are melons and cole slaw flying everywhere . The result is about as awful as suggested . Clearly the High Concept picture is not a recent idea .
Which is Olsen and which is Johnson ?	I suppose some people will like this , but not me . Olsen and Johnson , we are told , are one of the Crazy Comedy teams , like the Marx Brothers , the Ritz Brothers and Wheeler and Woolsey . The problem is that the farce is set up so absurdly with characters that are not particularly funny and the three leads - - Olsen , Johnson and Winnie Lightner - - play their parts at the top of their lungs . Lloyd Bacon seems to be at a loss as to how to direct these three other than by drowning out the two comics with a storm at sea . Unfortunately it doesn't work and they can still be heard . Claude Gillingwater does his best with his role as a bathing suit manufacturer who would consider a burkha too revealing . Talented and gorgeous comediennes , Dorothy Christy and Vivian Oakland are wasted and for some reason , the musical score includes Cole Porter's " You've Got That Thing . " A thoroughgoing dud . Keep an eye out for HELLZAPOPPIN , but skip this one .
Dreary	Given the mature talent of Henry King and the Gish sisters , this is a slow , dreary misfire . The plot proceeds at a deadeningly slow rate - - King liked to take his time , but this is ridiculous . For completists of the Gishes , King or William Powell
Editor needed to shave a bit closer	Even Billy Gilbert cannot shave - - I mean save - - this musical comedy about a rivalry between two barbers ' colleges run like a football game . It looks as though the editor thought it was funnier than it was and ran the reaction shots longer than needed , resulting in slow pacing and annoying gaps . Billy is in full cry doing Italian double talk AND a bit of his famous sneezing routine . If they had just kept the camera on him and left out the reaction shots entirely , it might have worked better . Indeed , it looks like the dp was trying to get out of the short subject department using inappropriately dramatic shots to demonstrate his brilliance . This very atypical MGM short was probably an attempt to fill in the gap left by Hal Roach's exit from short subject production . Alas , MGM never produced much worthwhile short subject material , the Robert Benchley lectures aside .
Role Reversal	Poor little short comedy which posits that in a hundred years men's styles will revert to Regency garb , and that there will be a complete role reversal , with Clyde Cook staying home alone while wife Katherine Grant goes tomcatting - - if that's the word - - around town . That and the blimps that can be seen out the window are the only jokes . Given that the gags would not be funny were the the sex roles not reversed , it's no better this way
Okay for pre-teen girls , I guess	This attempt to continue Margeret O'Brien's starring roles into her teens is completely unengaging to me - - although it is possible that in an earlier era , when magazines like TIGER BEAT appealed to pre-teens anxiously awaiting the onset of adolescence , it might have actually found an audience . But , speaking as a man in his fifties more than half a century later , it all seems too coy and calculated to be very interesting . Miss O'Brien's performance , as always , is excellent , but not at all suited to a comedy where she must carry the emotional weight herself - - her earlier roles , such as in MEET ME IN ST . LOUIS come off as comic because no one took her very seriously . Here it would require some very delicate work in all departments for the audience to care deeply about Miss O'Brien and yet not take her seriously , and it doesn't show up here .
They must be classy , they're English	. . . and they're excellent actors too , yet somehow , this mish-mosh of wasted talent manages to stumble the way through this lifeless second feature without any more than occasional signs of interest . There is a lion which roars with some energy and plays pat-a-cake with a dummy with some evident hope of making it as Leo's replacement at MGM . I wonder what happened to that lion .
The worst Melies film I have seen	i love Melies works , but this one , in which some toughs rob a drunk and then set off a bunch of fireworks to wake him from his efforts to sleep it off , is the worst one I have seen . there is some lovely acrobatics involve , but , alone among all his works , it lacks all sense of charm . Ay wheel , even Jove nods . This is one of the many previously lost or infrequently seen Melies pictures that have been made available by Serge Bromberg , David Shepherd and a myriad of other hands in the newly issued DVD set GEORGES MELIES : FIRST WIZARD OF CINEMA . Required viewing for anyone interested in the history of movies . . . . . and a lot of fun .
Driving Miss Daisy Mad	I first must note special interest : I do not like ' comedies ' in which animals are mistreated for the audience's amusement : Jules White & Zion Meyers ' DOGVILLE series for MGM fills me with horror . But chimpanzees are human enough and social enough that using them as performers does not disturb me and I have some fond members of the Marquis Chimps on television when I was a child . In this one , Snooky is the chauffeur for a family - - the family's children are played by the unknown child actors of A TRAY FULL OF TROUBLE . He is fired for smoking on the job and heads off , where he succors some scampish children who have fallen afoul of a gypsy . The Snooky starring vehicles are essentially novelty acts . Snooky dresses in clothes , has conversations with people via titles and even has a sidekick in this one - - a small dog that looks to be part toy poodle . But the humor is very primitive , suitable for very young children with no discrimination , the plot is melodramatic and the titles are enlivened only by low puns . I don't care for them . How about you ?
Industrial Scenery	Although this piece is no masterpiece of the American cinema , it is worthy of some comment . It is one of a series of industrial films shot by Billy Bitzer ( later D . W . Griffith's cameraman ) at the Westinghouse works near Pittsburgh , one of the earliest examples of industrial film making . It was released by American Mutuscope & Bioscope , which produced Griffith's films from 1908-1913 . On those grounds , these pictures are worth at least a footnote . Technically , these films seem unremarkable today , but , comparing them with contemporary pieces from the Edison Company , we can see that Bitzer had an excellent sense of composition . This four-minute film is a sequence shot from the internal railroad at the Westinghouse Plant . When we compare it to ' Panoramic View Near Mt . Golden on the Canadian Pacific R . R . ' shot two years earlier by James White - - who had no sense of composition - - we see that whereas White fixed his camera to the front of the train and showed you the tracks with a little bit of scenery in the upper left corner , Bitzer's camera usually confines the view of the rails to a small part of the frame , while he pans slowly back and forth , showing you buildings , trees and so forth . While not tremendously interesting , vastly superior . Buildings are , after all , more interesting than railroad tracks . Nor is Bitzer afraid to move his camera casually . Edison's cameramen never did . They learned to cut , they told stories , oftentimes innovatively and brilliantly , especially Edwin S . Porter , but the camera remained fixed . It's not Lawrence of Arabia , but we can begin to see the part played by Bitzer in Griffith's rise . Griffith provided the stories and direction . Bitzer provided the ability to photograph them in an interesting fashion . The two would go on to make cinematic history .
Uh Uh	Where to begin with the problems with this picture ? Shall we start with the missing footage , including the last two reels ? The fact that it seems to start out as a bedroom farce and then veers into black tragedy ? How about the actors ? OK , let's start with the actors . It's not their fault that they are miscast . I can't look at Mae Busch without expecting her to turn around and break a plate over Oliver Hardy's head . Conrad Nagel as the Deemster - - the term on the Isle of Man for the high judge - - is appropriately callow , but although he was a good actor , he had no presence , and allowed his female co-stars , including Patsy Ruth Miller , to push him around like a mop on screen . They do OK , but they don't add much to the picture . Then there's the movie itself . It starts out innocuously enough , looking like it is going to turn into a bedroom farce . Then bam ! It turns suddenly into a typical Sjostrom tragedy with Mae Busch being tried for murdering her illegitimate infant son - - was she pregnant ? She didn't look it - - and Conrad Nagel , who got her pregnant , presiding over the trial . Visually , the first half is absolutely run of the mill with no visual flair . Halfway through , when the tragedy begins , everything turns wild and stormy and very Sjostrom-like . I'd give this a miss unless you're a real fanatic for Sjostrom . Good thing to see that even Jove nods .
Slow , Not Tangled	This is a pretty poorly acted movie : leading men Jack Mulhall and Bert Moore bring little energy or expression to their roles , although Mulhall does beat up a couple of bad ' uns towards the end of this movie about kidnapped heiresses and what happens to them . The villains don't get to act much either , although the two heroines - - Edna Murphy and Constance Bennett do a little better . The best port of this New-York shot movie is the exteriors . You get a chance to see a large swath of Manhhatan , and a goodly chunk of it is still recognizable , although altered : Times Square looks great and I wouldn't mind a chance to examine a few frames and see exactly what Mary Pickford movie is playing - - probably DOROTHY VERNON OF HADDON HALL . One piece of advice , though ; if you're driving from 63rd and Central Park West to the Brooklyn Bridge via Broadway , don't switch to 5th Avenue at Madison Square . Washington Square Park will slow you way down .
six characters in search of a script	Drummond and his pals spend their time following the instructions of a pair of continental criminals who want revenge and , using his kidnapped fiancee as a prod , keep them running hither and yon to no particular purpose . Everyone seems ashamed to be in this turkey , especially John Barrymore , who spends much of his time underacting . If you are particularly enamoured of this series , which never exceeds watchable , or are a fiend for John Barrymore - - which makes some sense at any rate , give it a look . Otherwise , avoid it .
Backdrops	This is a nice little war scene : some Zoaves spike a petard to a door and blow it up in what is supposed to be , I suppose , Tournavos . A fairly good reenactment for the era , but nothing outstanding . . . . . except for the set design . Have you ever notice how three-dimensional and realistic even the most fantastic of Melies ' sets look ? He drew them himself . There's certainly more variation than in that single field in New Jersey in which Edison's unit shot all their battle scenes . This is one of the many previously lost or infrequently seen Melies pictures that have been made available by Serge Bromberg , David Shepherd and a myriad of other hands in the newly issued DVD set GEORGES MELIES : FIRST WIZARD OF CINEMA . Required viewing for anyone interested in the history of movies . . . . . and a lot of fun .
The Horse Makes All The Rules	It says here this is a serious story about how Rex the Wonder Horse saves grizzled old prospector James Finlayson's life , mine and stepdaughter - - the stepdaughter is played by Barbara Kent with perfectly plucked and drawn eyebrows - - from two baddies , Theodore von Eltz and Oliver Hardy , in perfectly serious bad guy characterizations . Yeah . Sure . Miss Kent seems to be channeling Mabel Normand's performance in MICKEY , and it's clear Hardy thinks he's playing the comic sidekick and , although he is playing a bad guy , he does get in the occasional gag . And Finn gets his moment of comedy , too , as he watches the baddies play a game of checkers to see who gets to kill him and who gets his mine and stepdaughter . Still , given that the hero of the story is Rex the Wonder Horse , who has his own girlfriend and his own comic sidekicks - - played by some burros - - how serious do you think any of these people were ? Rex ' career ended after half a dozen movies in 1929 - - I suppose his voice wasn't suitable to the talkies and he went into the pet food business . That's the movie business for you .
Pitching too straight for a screwball	Released the same year as MGM's LIBELED LADY , this light Warner's crime drama shares a lot of plot points , tries for a comic take on the subject , but fails , in no small part because Pat O'Brien does not display the diffident feyness that William Powell brought to his role , in part because Margaret Lindsay lacks a light touch but mostly , I fear , because the screenwriters and director Nick Grinde can't quite bring off the material - - certainly Pat O'Brien was capable of handling comedy material and there is a lot of strong comic supporting actors . It's odd to see Cesar Romero , who could have played his role as a gangster with great comic timing , play it straight . The two best comedians are Al Bridge and Harry Hayden , in two almost invisible roles - - both later members of Preston Sturges ' stock company . But screwball was still finding its way at this point , and Nick Grinde was not the director to help it along . Too bad .
Lifeless	Literal version of one of the lesser Holmes stories does not translate well to the silent screen . Although this team made a couple of dozen short Holmes movies in the early 1920s , they fail to demonstrate any real grasp of the character - - far too cerebral , alas , for so few words , and so not very good .
History Lurking	This production by Harry Cohn's nephew Robert , released through Columbia , looks , at first sight , like a Fox Production - - that bright , slightly overlit color photography that said " When we said Technicolor , we meant it ! " If DP Vincdent Farrar doesn't use the opportunity to produce any startling compositions , he does know how to use his cameras and locations to good effect . We also get a sense , for a change , that there is actually a history behind events in this western : the ranches have been here for generations , run by English-speaking people with Spanish names and probably land grants from the King of Spain in their safes . What reduces this effort to no more than middling is the acting . The older actors are fine , particularly Gordon Jones , who gets to play a straight role for a change . But the juvenile leads , Jerome Courtland and Beverly Tyler , don't sound like they are talking , but reading their lines . Still , if you're looking at a western , you're looking at pretty pictures first . There are plenty of those here .
Tummelers	When I was a kid , about when Hector was a pup , they still had acts like this : they would play the Catskill resorts and parties at country clubs : some people would come out and look like they were going to break their necks and the audience would laugh uproariously . They were called ' tummelers ' , which was Yiddish for . . . . well , the sort of act where someone would come out and pretend to almost break his neck . Usually it involved people falling off diving boards . Here it's people almost killing themselves on roller skates . It is not as easy as falling of a log . This is one of the many previously lost or infrequently seen Melies pictures that have been made available by Serge Bromberg , David Shepherd and a myriad of other hands in the newly issued DVD set GEORGES MELIES : FIRST WIZARD OF CINEMA . Required viewing for anyone interested in the history of movies . . . . . and a lot of fun .
Oo-la-la , Bebe !	During the twenties , Paramount made a lot of sophisticated comedies , which meant people , supposedly living in Europe in varying states of undress , coming to no good . This would prove that Middle America knew how to live . Many of them , alas , were not particularly funny . Except for Raymond Griffith , this is one of them . Bebe Daniels is talented and gorgeous , but this movie , is , largely , a series of of title cards . . . about the equivalent of reading a tersely-written play with a lot of photos from the New York production , which opened and closed in one night . However , when Raymond Griffith walks in , everything busts loose . The men are staring moony-eyed at the talented Miss Daniels - - we know she is talented , because we've seen her shine in Harold Lloyd comedies and in 42ND STREET - - as Raymond Griffith tries , unsuccessfully , to take a nap . He tries to get to bed - - only to find Bebe Daniels in bed with him , whereupon everyone rushes in to find her hiding under the bed and him cowering under the blankets . He wanders about in pajamas and a top hat . He collapses under the weight of fainting fiancées . Raymond Griffith is alive in this movie , while everyone else is , at best , posing . He is the one pleasure in this cardboard cutout of a movie and makes it worth seeing . If you are fanatic about seeing everything surviving with Mr . Griffith in in - - and his performance here , as in the handful of his starring Paramount vehicles that survive have made me anxious to - - then you'll want to see this , at least once . The rest of the movie , however , will stop you from seeing it again . If you want to see a sharply-turned farce with plenty of slamming doors , go see Peter Bogdanovitch's movie version of NOISES OFF ! or one of Charley Chase's brilliantly-timed silent shorts . If you want to see Mr . Griffith to advantage , track down a copy of HANDS UP ! And do look for Miss Daniels with Harold Lloyd . Despite the evidence of MISS BLUEBEARD , she really can be funny .
And bricks is Bricks	Gregory La Cava would go on to make the switch to live action movies and direct some excellent ones , including the classic MY MAN GODFREY . At this stage in his career , he was directing cartoons . This Krazy Kat cartoon hints at the weird and strange strip it is based on and works as a one-joke strip - - five panels would be sufficient . As a result , it drags . George Herriman , who originated the Krazy Kat strip was notable as the first African-American comic strip artist . Krazy Kat was , apparently , William Randolph Hearst's favorite strip and he mandated its appearance in Hearst newspapers . There is at least one collection of Krazy Kat strips that may show up in your local library . Those , at least , are worth your time .
A Draw	This is a very efficiently directed movie : so efficient , indeed , that there is not enough character friction or time for witty lines of dialogue to make things interesting . Mary Astor is the manipulative ex-wife , using Herbert Marshall's love of their daughter to control his life . Virginia Bruce is the supportive new wife who knows precisely what is going on and bides her time , making happy noises until Mary Astor can be unmasked . And Herbert Marshall is the brilliant lawyer who doesn't have a clue . The rest of the cast acts like it's a road show troupe of THE WOMEN . Indeed , several of the cast would be prominently featured in that movie when MGM made it the following year . This is a talented lead trio . Too bad they're not used to advantage here . Mary Astor is now best known for her role as Bridget O'Shaugnessy in John Huston's MALTESE FALCON , but she was a great screen actress , capable of stealing scenes from anyone and seems to have slept with everyone but William Haines . Virginia Bruce was a capable actress who just never seems to have made a great movie before her career began to slip . Herbert Marshall was a fine screen actor who survived into the 1960s . Adept at comedy ( TROUBLE IN PARADISE , BREAKFAST FOR TWO ) , he was just moving into the supporting-the-female-star phase of his career . Here he seems to be splitting the support , caught between two good dramatic leads . Go look at TROUBLE IN PARADISE . Seen it ? See it again .
Competing With Melies	This Robert Paul production directed by ex-stage magician Walter Booth is a comic warning about the effects of modernism . In this case , Professor Bakem offers his baby incubator , which will add a year's growth to an infant in a few minutes . But when the baby is put in the incubator , a fire starts , and when the baby is removed , it has the beard of an old man ! Although the production values are not as elaborate as those that Melies was employing , the frenetic movements of the players is highly reminiscent of Melies ' actors . Perhaps this was Paul's response to the great success of ex-stage magician Melies ' movies . The film industry was already international in scope and Paul understood that you give the public what it wants .
A Good Paul Terry Silent	Although in his forty years of regular production of cartoons , Paul Terry never climbed to the top of the heap - - he only garnered two Oscar nominations , one in 1944 and 1945 - - he usually produced a fair , if undistinguished product . This one , featuring Farmer Al Falfa and the usually cast of miscellaneous animals in support , demonstrates a lot of cheating - - mostly repetitive movement , but that movement is far more elaborate than usual for his work notice the interesting and intersecting lines of movement that add a good deal of excitement to the ice hockey game between Falfa and the cats . The subject , no surprise , concerns various winter sports . It is a valuable base line for a decent silent cartoon , although far below the levels of Felix and the gag-filled Fleischer cartoons of the period .
Early Semon - Better Than I Expected	I have expressed in the IMDb a mislike of Larry Semon's work , venting my spleen at length in my review for his THE SHOW ( 1922 ) . However here , where he is merely the lead comic and not the whole show , he has turned out a pretty good slapstick comedy . He shares the interesting pratfalls with his colleagues , including future producer Joe Rock , who are lumped together as ' The Big V Riot Squad . ' There is a lot of obvious camera trickery , but it is all done with such a light-hearted air that I am willing to forgive Mr . Semon , and there is even some fairly interesting lighting - - the scenes in the gang's cellar hideout are shot with far more chiaroscuro than most comedians would use . Not a great comedy by any means , but certainly not a waste of your time .
The Thrill of Keenan Wynn ?	A goofy Columbia musical : let's remake Hawks ' HIS GIRL Friday as a musical , only instead of Cary Grant , Rosalind Russell and Ralph Bellamy , we'll have Keenan Wynn , Evelyn Keyes and Allyn Joslyn , and instead of it being about newspapers and death , it will be about - - - nightclub producers ! Sounds like a waste of time , doesn't it ? Well , despite the undeniable talent of the people involved - - as well as that of director Sylvan Simon , yes it is . Except for the musical numbers and those are standouts . The songs aren't much , decent but forgettable , but dance director Nick Castle knew how to choreograph a dance number so well that they were lifting them five yes later for MGM musicals . And then , of course , there's Ann Miller . When she starts tapping , the movie becomes not just good but great . But there's too much time between the musical numbers . Worthwhile , but not great .
Wild Shooting in O'Brien Western	This is another of the solid B westerns that George O'Brien starred in for RKO in the 1930s . A good cast , including Laraine Day , so young she can't read her lines convincingly , and Stanley Fields doing his Wallace Beery imitation help to fill out this story about mining in the old west . The real standout in this picture , though , is Harry Wild's photography . The cinematography is fluid and graceful in its compositions , unusually so for a B western - - the interiors are darker than usual , which makes for better contrast . And as the outdoor sequences are shot against the backdrop of Red Rock Canyon State Park , you have some awfully pretty country to look at .
The End of the Beginning	Larry Semon took over the Vitagraph comedy division , changed it from a drawing room comedy sort of production unit to one emphasizing more Keystone slapstick and starred and directed some good comedies with good cinematography . But eventually , although his stuff remained popular , his budgets ballooned out of control , his gags became repetitive and instead of an ensemble of comedians , it became about Semon . Did he run out of ideas ? Was he simply unable to adjust to a more sophisticated way of constructing a comedy with a real plot and characters that would make an audience pay ? Or was he just annoyed that Chaplin and Lloyd could do these things and thought that bigger booms would substitute ? In this , we see Semon do a variation of Chaplin's THE ADVENTURER and while it is a decent enough comedy on its own terms , it doesn't begin to compare with the Chaplin effort . The gags are too cartoonish in their execution . It makes Semon , who doesn't give much of anyone screen time except for himself and Snooky the Humanzee . AlsoI can't accept a cast list which credits Norma Shearer as ' The Big V Beauty Squad ' and ranks her after a Chimpanzee , even at the beginning of her career .
Pirates	Pretty good adventure flick as Wayne Morris , fed up with the petty piracy of Wall Street , goes into business for himself , highjacking rumrunners ' ships bound to Prohibition America . Some pretty good sequences featuring Fred Kohler as a sadistic gangster , although Thelma Todd is pretty well wasted as a role that calls for her to play an idiot .
Flirting in the Park	Larry Semon produces his take on a typical Keystone farce , the flirting-in-the-park routine , where pretty Florence Curtis is pursued by four typical Keystone types : the wealthy geezer , the mustachioed Italian , the derby-wearing tough and , of course , the big-footed cop . . . . and here comes Larry , if not to save the day , at least to make us laugh . In this period , when Semon was taking over the Vitagraph comedy unit and changing it from a situational comedy style to a Keystone-farce style , he turned out a number of decent comedies . His unit's camera-work was better than Keystone's - - or at least shot in such a way that , as the prints degraded , they developed chiaroscuro instead of simply becoming unwatchable - - his editing was more understandable to the modern viewer and he had not developed the egotism that blighted his work in the ' 20s . Everyone has a fair share of gags , even the dog . If you like Keystones , you should give this one a try .
It's a romantic comedy because . . . .	A decently executed romantic comedy , this takes a highly delusional young woman who spends much of her spare time with an imaginary boyfriend . Then she encounters a handsome young man , charming , honest and , of course , they conceive an immediate dislike for each other . Since this made-for-TV movie is in a two-hour time slot , we know it will take about seventy-five minutes of screen time for them to fall in love . This could , of course , be played for tragedy , but not on ABC Family , so we have lots of comic relief around the personable but stolid leads : her nutty parents ( her mother is played by Edie McClurg ) and his stoner roommate . There is a tremendous amount of talent hiding in the corners of this movie and the unifying theme is how art reflects their lives . This is clearly intended by people in their fifties to appeal to young people they know nothing about . Occasionally it is ham-handed , but sometimes it shows the occasional flash of wit . Still , the need to keep things light dims the impact of the characters ' emotional problems and the touch of reality that might have elevated this into a superior work .
Good Script but . . .	A very good script and a briskly maintained pace of direction struggle with some handsome but unfortunately one-note performances . While I do not expect Sammi Hanratty in the role of the seven-year-old Celia to show the range and subtlety of of Shirley McLaine , Lacey Chabert as her older sister seems to spend most of the movie locked in low-key , depressed sarcasm and even old hands like Wendy Malick play their characters - - well , if not monotonously , then at least never straying far from the keyboard note they start out at . You may argue that this is the way movies , especially TV movies are made these days . Movies are made to accommodate demographics , and the demographics for beautiful , busty young actresses like Ms . Chabert are good enough to compensate the viewer for the fact that she does not have the range that she will , one hopes , develop as she grows . For old geezers like me , there is the eye candy and a story that makes some good points and touches our hearts a little . Am I unreasonable to hope for more ?
Comedy-Drama	This comedy-drama from the mind of Sam Katzman - - besides producing this quickie , he also directed - - is a fairly amusing story about how starving artist Bruce Bennett ( still credited as Herman Brix ) helps ditzy Joan Barclay whose father has pawned a fabulous diamond - - well , it's too long to explain here and for a Sam Katzman production it's a darned fine one . But neither Bennett nor Barclay are capable of reading their lines very well . Some good photography manages to survive the current muddy prints , but most of the fun is provided , as so often in the case , by supporting actors , including Vivienne Oakland as Bennett's landlord and Jimmy Aubrey as a junk dealer . Bennett became a better actor as time went on , but never got the real break he needed - - or perhaps he was never really good enough . Miss Barclay disappeared soon enough and Katzman kept on chunking them out .
The business of French Postcards	Johann Schwarzer had been making dirty motion pictures for a couple of years when he turned out this rather amusing one , a full reel in length , about the travails of a photographer who specializes in feelthy pictures . We see the photographer posing his model in various states of undress and a mild payoff as a woman comes in to berate him and his customers for engaging in pornography . The humor in the piece consists of the workaday attitude of the people involved , the uncaring manner in which the woman undresses and puts on shawls that accentuate her bosom . Of course , the whole idea was to provide an excuse to show naked women . Just as the first paying sites on the Internet were the porn sites , so the first commercial home-grown movies in Austria were this sort . A surprising number of them survive in the Vienna film archives . . . . or perhaps it isn't so surprising .
Not doing Chaplin	A fair little comedy with some nice gags and funny title cards . Billy is not doing his Chaplin imitation , but walks around in white pants and a straw boater . He's a lot less obnoxious in his mannerisms . There's a plot , too . Good heavens ! The man had some talents of his own !
Fireboats - - rather pretty	If you've never seen one of New York's fireboats in action , you've missed a movable fountain . It sucks the water out of the river and sprays it over whatever its powerful pumps can reach - - just the thing for a fire at a dock or dockside warehouse . Although I am not fond of the short Edison actualities - - and by 1903 they were so old hat as to be primeval - - this one manages to maintain some interest by virtue of the cascades of water . Motion pictures are about motion , after all , and the graceful moving arcs of the fountaining water qualifies as does the changes of bearing of the ship , like a beautiful woman moving to let you see her from the most advantageous angle .
Remaking the Classics	Pathe and Gaumont were the big players in motion pictures by this point and this remake of Melies ' classic VOYAGE A LA LUNE is an attempt to put the stake through his heart - - his productions were on the decline by the next year and would cease within another five years . So , in looking at this movie , we can compare it directly to the earlier version and see its comparative strengths and failures . Its strengths are obvious : greater production values , including a nicely done frame-within-a-frame bit . But its weaknesses are less obvious and more on aesthetic lines : the slapstick is cruder , the motions less balletic , despite using the young ladies of the Pathe corps to dance a little dance before the moon king and , in general , there seems to be less of a sense of fun : even the classic shot of the shell hitting the man in the moon in the eye is replaced by one in which it goes into his mouth . This is neither a key piece in cinema's evolution nor a better film in its own right .
While Squirrel Hunting In New Jersey We Were Attacked by a Pantomime Rhinoceros	That's the story Stan tells the court when he is a witness in a divorce proceedings . Then he is given a truth serum pill and we get another story entirely . . . . Stan was still working his young-man-in-a-boater bit when he made this short subject for Hal Roach , but it was probably the last time he did so , before he retreated to his burlesques of popular movies of the era like MUD AND SAND , then behind the camera for a few years . I find it mildly surprising that he did so , given that this is a very funny , if unusually absurd comedy . Perhaps this one flopped at the box office - - certainly the print I saw was a pretty poor multi-generational one , but there you are . Jimmy Finlayson also appears in this one , although briefly .
Sandy in the Dessert	Dalton " Sandy ' Sandifer's first writing credit has Woody's vacation in the dessert interrupted by a German-accented scientist who thinks he has landed on Mars and wants to take Woody back as a specimen . The script is certainly livelier than many Woody Woodpecker scripts of the era as Woody takes an active hand in tormenting his would-be oppressor , but while the gags are well thought out and timed , the continuing decline in animation technique is beginning to tell here . The ink and paint had been simplified to the point of minimalism for a couple of years , but the in-betweening that makes animation a pleasure was starting to go at this stage , Strill , the script is usually good enough to sustain the short , if not to make it a classic .
Crazy Like a Fox	This Christie Comedy shares a lot of plot points and gags with Charley Chase's CRAZY LIKE A FOX : Neal Burns wants to get out of being engaged to Lila Leslie , so he decides to act insane . Unlike Chase's comedy , however , we lack sympathy for Burns . He has not been asked to marry the unseen daughter of an old friend to satisfy his father , nor has he fallen in love with a girl that very afternoon - - the fact that she is the girl he is under orders to marry is a delicious little joke that the audience shares and that Charley is not in on . And that is , I would estimate , why the Chase piece is a near-classic , while this one is merely a good comedy with some fine gag sequences : we lack sympathy for Neal Burns , who wants what he wants when it is conventionally desirable , but not otherwise , This is , mind you , not a bad comedy . There are some very funny gag sequences , particularly the opening one in which the butler becomes increasingly violent with his mistress ' suitors . But great comedy requires more than great gags . It requires someone we can care about and I don't give a hang about Mr . Burns and his selfish wishes .
Stuck On You	A cute little scene , directed by the first film director , Alice Guy : a woman's maid is helping her at the post office by licking stamps , and a passing rake decides to steal a kiss with some unexpected results and a good payoff gag . Although things were beginning to move in terms of film direction by 1906 , Miss Guy's direction is simple and straightforward . Even as actualities - - basically , newsreel clips - - would be directed with a lot of cuts and interesting camera angles by Danish film makers , this remains primitive . It is , however , effective as the jokes involved are funny .
Stealing from the best	A very strong Alice cartoon as the movie concentrates on Julius , with Alice relegated to a small but key role . Julius goes courting , but another suitor is favored , so he decides to commit suicide - - just to give you an idea of how standards about what is appropriate for kiddie cartoons have changed in eighty years - - and consistently fails . The gags are well timed and many seem to be lifted from Harold Lloyd comedies - - Harold also had a propensity for trying to kill himself in his days in short subjects . Although none of the Alice in Movieland shorts are world beaters , some are very pleasant silent cartoons and this is one of the better ones .
Be a man !	Once you get over the extremely weak premise of this movie - - that Earl Rodney can't tell his parents that he is married to Dorothy Devore as they have chosen another bride for him , so he comes home with Dorothy disguised as a man - - this movie is played out with charm and good humor . Of course it all ends with the parents saying " Why didn't you tell us ! " , but had that been done in the first place , there would have been no movie , would there ?
VH-1 And Before	One of the numerous musical short subjects that the movie studios churned out , this one purports to offer you a sampling of songs from the Gay 90s and the Mauve Decade - - the latter being the first decade of the 20th Century . First they show you someone singing the song int he style of a Vaudeville performer of the era , then they offer you the words on the screen for a sing-along . The titles are " While Strolling the the Park One Day " , " The Bowery " , " After the Ball " , " In My Merry Oldsmobile " , and " Put on Your Old Grey Bonnet . " Except for the first , all you get is the chorus . Such featurettes were common to movie theaters . Indeed , photographs of early movie theaters advertise sheet music and performances ; and Max Fleischer began his famous ' Follow the Bouncing Ball ' series of cartoon sing-alongs in 1926
Midnight in the Drugstore	1936 was the year Harman and Ising began to create good cartoons , but they remained wedded to a sentimental childishness that stopped them from achieving great cartoons . Ising would eventually overcome that , but Harman never quite did . Here , the problem is that we know the main character is sleeping , so his dreaming peril is not as frightening as it might be . The best thing about their cartoons from this period is their lush use of Technicolor . While this is not so over the top as TO SPRING , it shows some excellent visual glosses . The middle of this cartoon is a common one for Harman-Ising and for Schlesinger in this period : the contents of a bookstore , row of billboards or , in this case , the various brands in a drugstore . Some of them are still current . Enjoy spotting the ones you know .
Trick Film Comedy	This Vitagraph film from 1907 is a fairly good trick comedy for the era . A mad scientist figures out how to convert electricity to a liquid - - which reminds me of the Thurber story about his aunt who thought electricity was leaking from empty light sockets - - and he proceeds to spray it on slow moving people , whereupon they move like lightning . This simple gag is repeated four or five times . The interesting point about this movie is that it shows signs of very careful cutting and possible back-screen projection , sometimes two or three layers of it , but done so carefully that it can only be inferred . The scientist sprays the electricity on a subject and the subject speeds up , but the scientist does not . The only way I could think of doing it was back-screen projection , but I'm not even sure it was invented at this time .
Solid Western - - Hart potboiler	A fairly standard silent western without much to lift it out of the standard mold . Although Hart would later become extremely proficient at choosing his vehicles , this one doesn't have much to recommend that would draw attention to it - - for Hart fans only .
Ripping the Tinsel from the Tinsel	A very pleasant comedy from the Stern Brothers , this concerns a woman who , in her own words " want to be an actress in the worst way " , and no , the director , comedy veteran William Watson , doesn't step on his own lines . He allows the audience to supply the punch line . In the meantime , Mr . Watson shows us the silly shoddiness behind the movies . If not as multi-layered as the Lloyd Hamilton / Roscoe Arbuckle THE MOVIES , released a year earlier , this is a straight farce with straightforward gags that are well executed . They won't enlighten or ennoble you . but they will make you laugh . Surely that's enough . Leading actress Edna Marion went on to a supporting role at Roach and worked for a while longer . She is willing to look funny for this movie , and do silly things . There's no clear sign of any noteworthy talent here , but this movie doesn't need it .
They don't ' em this way any more	A decent but unremarkable slapstick comedy , full of absurd exaggerations , some funny gags and little more . The theaters used to be full of this , but somehow audiences stopped caring for them in the sound era and this sort of humor found its final resting place in Warner Brothers cartoons . Now they don't even know how to make those right any more . Sad really , but looking at this shows you how it can be done .
Guy Kibbee , Nice Guy	Having starred in a toned-down version of Sinclair Lewis ' Babbit , Guy Kibbee was considered enough of a leading player to star in B movies - - in this case as a small-town dentist who inherits two million dollars from an uncle who , unknown to Guy and family , was a leading racketeer . Instead he and his wife - - played abrasively by Cora Witherspoon as a Mrs . Malaprop - - and daughter abandon their small town life to attempt to make a splash in society . Although no classic , director Killy - - who spent most of his career directing B westerns - - shows a nice light touch in this outing . Although no classic , at only an hour , it is a pleasant enough example of its type of social comedy to be worth your while .
Guy Kibbee , Star !	Guy Kibbee gets a rare leading role in this amiable comedy-mystery about some missing emeralds - - not who stole them , but how he's going to return them . Plus the usual murder or two . Kibbee plays his usual amiable buffoon , only sharper-eyed , and the whole thing plays like a travesty of THE THIN MAN .
It's Your Turn in the Barrel	Melies provides us with a simple magic trick - - or is it so simple ? - - as , dressed in Greek garb , he stuffs nine young women in chitons , one after another , into a barrel . It's not terribly elaborate , but it is very well done , as he presents us with simply a magic trick , combining his skills as a stage magician with those of a camera magician - - and he knows his art enough to give us a topper at the end . This is one of the many previously lost or infrequently seen Melies pictures that have been made available by Serge Bromberg , David Shepherd and a myriad of other hands in the newly issued DVD set GEORGES MELIES : FIRST WIZARD OF CINEMA . Required viewing for anyone interested in the history of movies . . . . . and a lot of fun .
I'm on the Bad Guy's Side	One of Melies ' super-productions , like VOYAGE A LA LUNE and LA ROYAUME DES FEES , this is a bit of fairy tale , about a minstrel who rescues his love from dungeon , with lots of sparklers , the usual wonderful Melies camera trickery and , in the print I was fortunate enough to see today , lots of hand-tinting . While Melies ' day was passing rapidly - - Gaumont and Pathe had caught up with him in camera trickery and , if they did not produce the lush looking background and foreground that Melies specialized in , they were large enough enterprises that they could take away his market - - and Melies ' film grammar always remained primitive : usually confined to the proscenium arch , his cutting rarely showed any of the sophistication discovered by George Smith in England and elaborated on by Zecca in France . Stiill , Melies was putting up a big fight against the competition , and this is an very enjoyable movie to watch . My only issue with it is that I am on the side of the Fee Carabosse - - the minstrel paid her , not with gold , but with sand !
Kershner directs Corman feature	This is a surprisingly strong AIP feature , a first for Irvin Kershner as writer and director . Although stylistically it seems , at first sight , little more than an expanded DRAGNET episode in which you get to see the criminals ' viewpoints , this largely no-name cast gives a bunch of decent performances with some well-written characters . The feature is about a group of rather clueless teenagers - - who appear to use all their off-screen time body building - - who discover a cannister of heroin . Neither hard core criminals nor saints , they want all the things that society says they should want , and are not choosy about how they go about getting it . The writing and direction are stronger than the acting , but the overall effect is quite striking . Definitely worth your time .
Marvelous Movie For Actors - - the rot sets in	Joanne Woodward gives a marvelous performance - - which , of course , is a done deal . Miss Woodward , I am convinced , is no more capable of giving less than a marvelous performance than I am of flapping my arms and flying to the moon . With a marvelous supporting cast including Estelle Parsons , Geraldine Fitzgerald and Donald Moffat before he had eyebrows , it is a feast for lovers of marvelous performances . They all give marvelous performances . A good deal of credit must , undoubtedly , go to Paul Newman , director , who as a marvelous actor , knows how to give marvelous performances and how to use the camera to highlight those performances . The problem is that , given those marvelous performances , the story consists of a couple of days in which Miss Woodward's character recognizes that her life stinks . That is to say that you spend approximately one hundred minutes in a section of the story that should take about ten . And then , of course , the story is over . Compare this to , say , THE THREE FACES OF EVE in which Miss Woodward gives three marvelous performances and we learn something , however spurious , about the benefits of psychotherapy , and you will understand what I mean . Why did they make this movie ? Answer : there were no more real studios , and Paul Newman was a star with clout . He wanted to make this movie , so this movie was made in hopes that he would look fondly on Warner Brothers for future deals . Or maybe it was part of a deal : he got to make this movie , then he would appear in some movies that Warner Brothers wanted to make . Given the level of talent Mr . Newman had to work with , it isn't half bad . But it isn't really that far from this movie to WATERWORLD .
Welcome to Our Hearts Again , Iolanthe	This elaborate and well-staged silent version of Hertz ' play is exceedingly well produced for 1913 : it starts off by introducing the actors by name and role , then showing them in double exposure in street clothes and in costumes . The production values are also elaborate and the look of the set designs reminds one of the elaborate backdrops that Melies used in his shots . However , it also shows the problems that afflicted Thanhouser : the shots are long , static , and all too often , tightly , almost claustrophobically blocked . The acting is stage acting , and even though care is taken with crowd compositions , the effect is occasionally jarring . Still , the elaborate sets and costumes , as well as the fun of the story moves things right along . Very worthwhile for anyone interested in the evolution of the American movie in this critical period .
Nothing Special	This Al St . John short was directed by his uncle , Roscoe Arbuckle , anonymously , after his acquittal for the manslaughter of Virginia Rappe caused him to be banned from performing . Yes , I know . It doesn't make sense . The plot is so simple that the movie can be followed despite having Czech titles : St . John plays a bicycle messenger who is supposed to deliver a letter - - well , his stage act was as a trick bicyclist . Along the way he gets mixed up with some spies who want to steal the letter and some lions . It ends up with a nicely done bit of thrill comedy as he perches high atop a flagpole while one of the spies chops at its base with an axe . The movie lacks much in the way of structure , being little but a series of gag in a straightforward time sequence , without much in the way of subtext to connect them - - fairly primitive for this period and within a year or two Arbuckle would be writing and directing far more sophisticated comedies with lots of subtext - - the hilarious CURSES ! or the elaborately doubled vision of THE MOVIES . Perhaps in the aftermath of the trials , Roscoe had fallen back on producing ' em fast and cheap to pay off his lawyers and to start rebuilding his life . If so , he worked to his and St . John's strengths . It's very funny .
Cops and Robbers	William S . Hart plays one of his ' good bad man ' roles , this time not in the wild west of the cattle ranges , but in the wild west of San Francisco . Hart gives one of his usual fine performances as he returns from World War One a hero and has to decide between his old life in a criminal gang and a new life as a cop . The morality is a lot more conflicted than usual , but he brings it off . One of the things you might miss in this movie is Joseph August's breathtaking cinematography of the wild lands . San Francisco is a cinematic city , but we don't see much of it here , mostly in backdrops .
When cliffhangers had them hanging off cliffs !	Exciting late-silent 10-episode serial , with all the hallmarks of the genre , including daring cavalry rescues , gold robbers and , of course , the beautiful white girl being burned at the stake by savage redskins . They don't make ' em like this anymore , and the reason they don't is that the serial died out : there isn't enough material out there to lure the kids into a Saturday matinee at the same theater every week . If you enjoy the sort of suspense that a tv show like " 24 " gives you , then you would have enjoyed the serials in general , and this one in particular .
Rin-Tin-Tin : Nature vs . Nurture and the Issue of Free Will	Raised by wolves , Rin-Tin-Tin comes into contact with people in the ill-defined far north of Canada . Will he submit to his training and go frolic with she-wolves , or become the loyal servant of man , help catch the baddies and make the Warner Brothers a truckload of money ? In a town where they've always known that if truth and legend conflict , you print the legend , Rin-Tin-Tin is an interesting movie star . There had been other dog stars , like Jean the Vitagraph Dog , or Keystone's Teddy , who starred in TEDDY AT THE THROTTLE , but Rinty was huge , leading to Sandow the Dog , Rin-Tin-Tin Jr . , Lassie and dozens of others , an entire industry of animal stars . . . . or was it his publicity , in the wild era of 1920s ballyhoo ? Would Warner Brothers have gone under except for the profit of his movies ? Would we have lost the madness surrounding Al Jolson's performance in THE JAZZ SINGER ? Would the entire face of popular culture be enormously different , or were the Olson Twins predestined ? Weighty issues to discuss at 3AM in the dorm room when you don't want to cram for an exam , but it's just a movie , folks . It's a moderately well-made movie , which is hardly surprising , given that Chester Franklin , directed and Lewis Milestone - - yes , that Lewis Milestone - - edited . Also , in this rather title-heavy production , Rinty is clearly the best actor . You can read his emotions , while the humans maintain expressions of guarded wariness . And the story is moderately interesting . I really don't know . I liked it . Maybe you will too . Worth a try if it comes your way .
Don't bolt for the door !	Another of the excellent and underappreciated Sid Smith-James Parrott series that enlivened short comedies at the beginning of the 1920s . Here , Smith is the eponymous ' auto nut ' and Parrott is a crooked lawyer - - gosh , they had them around then , too ! - - who hires cripples to be thrown under Smith's car for quick cash . Quirky and inventive , these are a must for any fan of silent comedy .
The Chase Comedy	By 1907 , the chase comedy was already well established and we would , in the next few years , see people chasing monkeys , pumpkins and runaway horses in films from all countries , until the Keystones simultaneously immortalized and rendered the chase trite . SPOILER HERE : However if you think that you are about to see a group of people in pursuit of a runaway wheel of cheese , you are much mistaken ! Here it is the lively cheeses - - including one vengeful brie - - who indulge in the pursuit ! A startling variation . This is one of the many previously lost or infrequently seen Melies pictures that have been made available by Serge Bromberg , David Shepherd and a myriad of other hands in the newly issued DVD set GEORGES MELIES : FIRST WIZARD OF CINEMA . Required viewing for anyone interested in the history of movies . . . . . and a lot of fun .
The Little King	One of half a dozen movie cartoon's based on Soglow's " Little King " panel comic strip . These are among the best cartoons that Van Beuren turned out . Soglow did the writing and the simple black & white drawing that was in favor at Van Beuren matches Soglow's style and the strip was silent , which works well . Unhappily , there are only a few of these and none are in color . Some of the jokes are standard cartoon jokes , but the good ones are about the Little King and his desire to not have to deal with the boring rituals of being royalty . Fortunately , there's always a hot dog vendor or mermaid around when you want one . . . .
A Fine Western Comedy from George Marshall	Other reviewers have spoken of the pleasures of seeing William Holden and Glenn Ford at age 23 , both so young as to be almost unrecognizable ; and Claire Trevor , too and Edgar Buchanan as a dentist - - he was one in real life , before he turned to acting . But I think a lot of credit is due to the director , George Marshall . Today , almost the only Marshall movie anyone knows is the justly famous 1939 version of DESTRY RIDES AGAIN . But he was primarily a comedy director , back to the 1920s when he directed Fox Sunshine comedies , to the 1930s , when he worked at Roach on Laurel and Hardy , through the early 1970s . And this movie was directed during his peak period and it shows it . The comedy sequences are wonderfully directed , especially the boxing match . So , while you're enjoying the acting , remember that the funny broad comedy comes from the mind of the director .
A well told tale	THE KNIGHT OF THE TRAIL is an early William S . Hart picture , in which all the usual elements of his pictures are present . Sparse , filled with excellent , underplayed acting - - Frank Borzage , who went on to become a great director , plays the villain here - - and a straightforward story line , this is an excellent introduction to the silent western for someone without enough patience to sit through TUMBLEWEEDS at one showing .
Doo Wah Diddy	This short subject showcases Phil Harris and his easy-going charm , as he helps out a friend when he's mistaken for a male escort . Harris sings ' But It's the Woman Who Pays " and " That's What I like About the South . " Hm . I hope I punctuated that last sentence correctly .
Oh , the Moon Shines Bright	Griffith had an affinity for RAMONA , having appeared in two stage versions of the novel and having hectored his bosses into paying a hundred dollars for screen rights - - this two-reeler was advertised as the most expensive picture ever made . It falls into the class of Griffith films in which he expresses sympathy for minorities and suggests that the best thing to do with people is to leave them alone . This statement may come as a bit of a shocker to those whose only knowledge of Griffith is knowing , second hand about the racism of BIRTH OF A NATION , but none to those who are familiar with more of his work : BROKEN BLOSSOMS also falls into this category and , to a great extent , so does BOAN . Although this film is full of fine visual touches - - some excellent deep-focus shots of the characters with the distant mountains behind them dominate the camera-work - - and has good performances by Mary Pickford in the title role and a slightly over-the-top performance by Henry Walthall , there is far too much solitary posing and the two reels are too brief for the story . Still , Pickford and Walthall are excellent in their scenes together , Griffith has some lovely landscape to work with and his stock company is up to their usual level of competence .
Stagy	Beautiful translation of Jean Renoir's script is hampered a bit by its stage confines and acting levels , but manages to be exciting nonetheless because of its situations . Leslie Caron manages to overcome the need to be heard in the back of the theater in the title role , but the other actors fail to overcome the limitations .
Dog and Pony Show	Poodles Hanneford was a circus clown , best known for his equestrian act . When the Weiss brothers decided to try him out for the movies in the waning days of silent comedy , they settled , in this short , on a circus background . And when this short is about circus gags , it is very good . Mr . Hanneford may remind the latter-day viewer a bit of Shemp Howard in his reactions , albeit without all the tics and squeaks - - which I always found more annoying than funny anyway . His falls and other stuntwork are fine , and were this short no more than those , it would be excellent , a documentary of the sort of clowning that went on in that era . Unhappily , however , it is more than that , and lessened thereby . Mr . Hanneford's reactions are broad , suitable for a three-ring circus , but given the comparative intimacy of a movie screen , overly broad and mechanical . In addition , there are too many ' clever ' titles early on that distract from the real fun - - including a version of the famous equestrian act with some too obvious wirework , but some real and beautiful falls . Given time and patience , Mr . Hanneford might have developed into a worthwhile screen presence , but this was 1928 and silent comedy's days were numbered . So see it for the circus gags and take some pleasure in survival of some real and distinctive entertainment .
Cabin Fever	Well-acted , believable triangle as caddish Paul Cavanagh and honorable William Boyd - - no , the other one - - almost come to blows over Lupe Velez , while he food in the snow-stranded cabin is on the verge of giving out . And who could blame them ? Will they kill each other or will the storm do it for them ? Early writing credit for John Huston .
Competition	A superior two-reeler from the Kalem Company . Although Kalem was a popular studio in the first couple of decades of the 20th century , it fell apart , as did most of the Patents Trust companies in the late teens . Certainly , this effort is worthwhile . Good acting , good composition - - unlike Griffith's work , which usually used the right wall as a border , this one seems to use the left wall in various forms . Meanwhile the story involves plots , lovers , and a locomotive chase . It's all fairly familiar territory to anyone who is familiar with the works of D . W . Griffith , but it's important to see that other people knew what Griffith was doing and could produce works that were as good .
A new style	After a couple of years of Lonesome Luke , Harold Lloyd and Hal Roach decided to try a new character , the " Glasses " character that Lloyd always referred to as " The Boy . " Dressed in a straw boater , glasses and an ascot tie - - the Ascot would disappear about 1922 - - the character , like Douglas Fairbanks ' screen character , was recognizable human , slightly larger than life and , in the end , enormously and properly popular . In this early effort , however , although the look is fine , the technique is not quite there - - Lloyd remains a knockabout slapstick comedian . He's fun , but he's not quite Harold Lloyd yet . The entire cast seems to be on the edge of the new style . There are plenty of characters in here dressed in silly facial hair , but even Snub Pollard is given his proper name in the credits .
Caught and Released into the Theaters	One of the late Pete Smith Specials from MGM , this features a lot of newsreel footage of various unlikely events , such as buildings being blown up , concrete blocks intended for construction purposes accidentally being dropped into the water and , best for for my taste , various ungainly early attempts at building heavier-than-air flying machines , including a most improbable one in which a bunch of wings are arranged in a sort of waterwheel arrangement , going up and down . That one needs to be seen to be believed , and even after having seen it , I'm not sure it was intended as more than a spoof . All of these clips are accompanied , as usual , by Pete Smith's snide voice , expressing , as usual , a certain worldly-wise contempt for the entire proceedings . Well , the man started out as a publicist , so he should know .
Pretty Durned Good	This is an excellent early sound serial , with an wonderful cast - - including the always hissable Noah Beery Sr . as the villain , the now too frequently forgotten Tully Marshall and , of course , Johnny Mack Brown in the lead . The crew is also topnotch , including Demille cinematographer Alvin Wyckoff and some great stuntwork by Yakima Canutt , including the famous falling-under-the-stagecoach gag . Oh , and the story is pretty good , too . And that's just the first chapter of this twelve-episode serial ! To top it off , Sinister Cinema , which has just transferred this to DVD - - look them up online - - has managed to find an almost perfect print , and the beautiful camera-work is , as always , a revelation - - all too often black and white movies are preserved in muddy prints , transferred to safety stock in an offhanded fashion . Not this one ! If you enjoy western serials , hunt this one out . If you've never seen one , this is a fine introduction .
Strong Cast of Unknowns Helps Good Crawford Programmer	The title of this review says it all . In 1951 , who knew who Ernest Borgnine , Richard Kiley and Charles Buchinsky were ? But in this Columbia noir , made after Broderick Crawford became an unlikely star because of ALL THE KING'S MEN has the lead going undercover to investigate racketeering on the docks , we see how good actors can overcome a basically decent script overloaded with ' snappy ' dialog , cheap sets and unexceptional directing . The actors are , frankly , amazing and this is as good as a movie can get with a major flaw like this - - ace DP Joseph Walker can't do much with the studio sets and back projection , but he makes a good effort with a highly mobile camera .
Father of the Bride	Another of Benchley's Mr . Doakes shorts - - some of which were produced at MGM and others at Paramount , this casts Robert Benchley reduced to a nullity as the father of the bride - - and the similarity of Spencer Tracy's performance nine years later in the classic Minnelli comedy is amazing . Although these short subjects are not as hilarious as the ones in which Benchley explains a subject ineptly - - the primordial THE TREASURER'S REPORT ( 1928 ) or the perfect , Oscar-winning HOW TO SLEEP ( 1935 ) , these Joe Doakes shorts are wonderful , low-key comedy shorts and a thorough delight for the movie buff . At only ten minutes each , they can be used to round out a pleasant couple of hours of watching old flicks .
Enter the Mynah	Chuck Jones ' Inki cartoons are rarely seen these days , because Inki is a small , stereotyped Hottentot with a bone in his hair , and we have come to see such images as racist and demeaning . Here , on exhibit in a circus and deviled by two dogs , one of whom would be developed into the high-pressure Charlie Dog of half a dozen cartoons , Inki is pursued and bedeviled - - and pursues and bedevils the dogs . But Inki , although the protagonist in these movies , is not the key character . The real star is probably the greatest of the Warner Brothers characters , a black mynah bird who has the best entrances in the business - - here he bursts out of a heavy safe - - and who walks , hunched over , through the cartoons with a stuttering , hopping step , underscored by a slow jazz beat . And whenever the mynah bird appears , so does chaos , because he's getting where he's going no matter what you do . The mynah is the trickster , even more than Bugs Bunny's take on Rabbit . In some ways he is a precursor on the Roadrunner , but much purer and funnier . It is a pity that he was always paired with Inki , because this makes him obscure - - the only other time I have seen him appear is in a meaningless turn in one of the Tweety-Sylvester mysteries that the Cartoon Network ran about the turn of the millennium . But these movies do turn up occasionally , if maddeningly infrequently . If you have a chance to see one , don't miss it .
Pleasant fun	One of the better efforts from the Van Beuren studio . Although not the best cartoon studio in any department , Van Beuren often ran a very pleasant second . Here the jokes are better conceived and timed than usual , with the ranks of Dan Cupids dressed in Mountie outfits , since " We always get our man . " In this case , the particularly tough case is to get W . C . Fields together with Edna May Oliver !
A Bit of Everything	Another of the terrific comedies that Hoot Gibson starred in for Universal before they dropped his contract in a panic at the dawn of the sound era - - I suppose as he wasn't a relative of Carl Laemmle , it was ok . this one shows Hoot displaying his easy-going charm as he and two other claimants compete for a valuable gold mine . There are a couple of brilliantly composed scenes , particularly the Mexican fiesta that turns into a duel , but it all comes down to good writing and Hoot Gibson's star power , and it delivers . Some of the joke may be considered offensive today , although given who utters them - - vile , despicable claim jumpers - - jokes that the gold vein is so deep that " It goes to the roots of the chop suey tree " can be viewed as in character . Besides , standards of decency have not universally risen - - there are no bullet-ridden corpses oozing sticky blood here . What use is a movie without people oozing blood ? Well , there are a few laughs , a plot that makes some sense an some good thrills here that don't involve computer faking . Take a look .
When World Collide	An excellent melodrama as Tsuru Aoki marries American sailor Frank Borzage - - a curly-haired fellow before he turned director - - despite a family curse that causes volcanoes to ' empty their bowels ' when daughters marry - - apparently no such penalty befalls the men . Sessue Hayakawa , in heavy makeup , is unrecognizable as , indeed , are most of the actors , but director Reginald Barker , about to embark on a course of William S . Hart movies , produces a marvelous set-piece of a lynch mob on the trail of the lovers and the father , who has converted to Christianity , followed , of course , by a volcanic eruption . It all holds your interest expertly and you should not miss a chance to see this one .
Dreaming of Wackyland	Bob Clampett , director of this cartoon , was one of the great cartoon directors that made Looney TUnes and Merrie Melodies so great . His greatest strength was his ability to take images and ideas and stretch them endlessly and his great masterpiece , PORKY IN WACKYLAND is the great exemplar of that . But here , in this short where Porky dreams of being an ancient Greek hero who fights the gorgon , we see that same sensibility . This is a riotous cartoon , full of puns both verbal and visual , and wild images . This would be , I feel , a great cartoon , except for one small flaw : it is all couched as a dream . But even with that , it is still excellent and a rarely seen cartoon . If you have a chance , don't miss it .
Betty Goes Hawaiian	The Betty Boop cartoons - - or " Talkartoons " were always superior musically to the competition but Disney usually was better in terms of animation . The Fleischer Brothers , however , were always ahead technically , both with sound ( in 1924 ) and here , were the dance numbers are clear animated using rotoscope .
A Flea in Her Bridal Bed	If you are unfamiliar with Max Linder's films , it might be worthwhile to tell you that he was the first international comedy star and that Charlie Chaplin said he learned a great deal from watching his films . In his film career , which extended from 1905 through the mid-1920s , he typically played variations on the young boulevardier . In this one , it is his wedding night , married to the beautiful Stacia Napierkowska . He and his bride are sleeping . . . . . and a flea keeps disturbing him . The variety of his reactions and his increasingly agitated efforts to get rid of the pest are the whole of this excellent movie . A fine introduction to this comedian .
When Sir John Mills was in kneepants	Bright farce played at a good speed is sure to delight those who enjoy the form . The big plus for this movie , though , is the fact that half of it takes place at a music hall , and half a dozen excellent acts fill out the film . This is an early writing credit for Frank Launder and is the movie debut of Will Hay .
Just One of Those Things	A beautifully written and sometimes magnificently played serious movie . Chester Morris and Carole Lombard love each other , but she is terrified of the corrosive effects of the life of poverty that she foresees with Morris . So they break up and they drift into lives as a kept woman and a gigolo . The two are almost perfect in their roles ; Chester Morris plays a character who is almost unable to phrase a clear thought and pulls it off beautifully , for a wonderful payoff scene . Miss Lombard only fails in one scene , towards the end , when she is contemplating suicide : I blame the heavy-handed direction of it rather than her performance . But the movie is riddled with wonderful performances : the always excellent Alison Skipworth as Lombard's supportive mother ; Reginald Barlow as the father who gives her no chance ; Adrienne Ames and Walter Byron as their likable seducers . Particularly good is Rita La Roy , an actress whom I have never noticed before , as a kept woman who kills herself - - alas , this was her best part in the movies , After her career faded out she sold yachts , Cary Grant is also present in a small role , in his second movie , but if you're not paying attention to the soundtrack you could easily miss him : his voice was far more distinctive than his good looks at this stage of his career . There is a happy ending , but it feels forced . That is the one flaw in this movie . Otherwise it is well worth your time .
What would the Vanderbilts say ?	Muriel Evans has decided to defy family convention and take part in a beauty contest in Oceanside and her parents have hired " Fearless " who turns out to be timid Charley Chase to find her and stop her . This is one of Charley's better sound shorts in which Thelma Todd does not appear . It's strengthened by some nice location shooting in Oceanside , California , some nice supporting physical comedy by Heinie Conklin and most of all , by leading lady , Muriel Evans , who looks to be having a lot of fun - - her reaction shots to Charley's gag with the asparagus are priceless . The entire thing is directed by Charley's brother , James Parrott and it looks to have been a very enjoyable shoot for everyone .
High Peaks	At times this movie is brilliant beyond my powers of description to note . At other times it turns stupid . Langston Hughes ' poetry and powerful images dominate some scenes . At others we have the sight of Clarence Muse in a dress and veil , or Bobby Breen advancing the plot while Alan Mowbray does his best to make it interesting by a little judicious mugging . Even the musical numbers are erratically choreographed . The last may have been an attempt to either appease white audiences who would never see this movie or a choreographer utterly ignorant of jazz dancing . In 1939 ? It doesn't make sense . Perhaps it was shot , edited , tested and then someone else went back to do some ham-handed reshooting . The problems I have with the execution of this movie cannot be denied , but its strengths are undeniable . Take a look at it and bear in mind that this was released in he same year as GONE WITH THE WIND .
Hydrophobia	Alas , Max has a neurosis about getting wet , so his fiancée throws him over : she tosses her engagement ring on a ribbon into the ocean and announces that if Max wants to get her back , he must produce the ring on a ribbon . Max is particularly good playing a bit of a maniac , and he is at his most amusing here , first with his not terribly unusual distaste for the ocean , then with his attempts to resign himself to the horrible stuff and finally with the concluding gag . Before the rise of Charlie Chaplin , Max Linder was the world's most successful movie comic and one of the few people that Chaplin cited as an influence on himself . In a career that ran from 1905 through 1924 , he rang most of the comic changes between Pierrot and pure slapstick . A necessary - - and entertaining - - performer for anyone interested in the history of movies .
Variations on a Theme : the Little Match Girl	Another of Melies dreams of an easier life as a poor chimney sweep - - recall if you will , that this dirty and dangerous task was performed by children who could fit into cramped , sooty chimneys - - falls asleep and dreams he is clean , caparisoned in rich clothes and seated on a throne , where officers and courtiers dance for his delight . Melies ' subtext is not at all subtle here , but it is no less powerful a plea for an end to child labor for that . A clear example of the fact that fantasy allows us to examine those issues which straight fiction is too harsh or nuanced for clarity . This is one of the many previously lost or infrequently seen Melies pictures that have been made available by Serge Bromberg , David Shepherd and a myriad of other hands in the newly issued DVD set GEORGES MELIES : FIRST WIZARD OF CINEMA . Required viewing for anyone interested in the history of movies . . . . . and a lot of fun .
Daffy at his most annoying . . .	We have here Daffy being as obnoxious as he can be as he tortures Porky Pig , with whom he is sharing a room . This is an early McKimson , and one of his best . In a couple of years , Chuck Jones would take Daffy and remold his personality , but here we see a fine mechanical rendition of the little black duck .
Everyone's a Critic	I've just had to revise my opinion of this movie . Previously I had thought it chaotically performed and edited . However , I have just come from the Museum of Modern Art where they have shown a print of this as part of a twelve-program series of Roscoe ' Fatty ' Arbuckle movies . It was the most complete print I've seen of this movie and it takes its place along with the other classic late-Keystone Arbuckles like THE WAITER'S BALL and HE DID AND HE DIDN'T . The ending is still abrupt . There's a shot of Washington Square Arch that makes me believe it was shot as a three-reeler , but that's all that survives of the third reel . Perhaps , though the missing footage will turn up . Structurally it's an episodic series of one-reelers , something that Chaplin was still using twenty years later in MODERN TIMES : in the first , Roscoe gets a job as a janitor in a skyscraper and performs a series of gags on that theme . In the second , he is mistaken by the wife of the building's manager for a Missouri businessman she has been asked to entertain . " Are you Stout ? " she asks , since that is the man's name . Roscoe , of course , misunderstands her . . . . On the way out of the museum , however , I was annoyed to hear one of the people who had been to the show announce " But it's still the same old pratfalls . " True enough . And FINNEGANS WAKE is still the same old alphabet . There hasn't been a new letter added since the 17th century . You will pardon me , I hope , for thinking that someone who can't differentiate between a capital C and a small o is not likely to utter intelligent criticism of English literature . I submit that someone who cannot tell the difference between a neck roll and a 108 probably can't make an informed statement about silent comedy . Well , I can tell the difference , and I think Arbuckle made some damned fine comedies and this is one of them . If you manage to see a good print , I think you might agree .
Wow !	Here's an amazing short film about someone you've never heard of : the man who works out how to take those traveling shots from impossible angles - - and then does it . Although nominally a promotional film for ICE STATION ZEBRA , we get to see some of the stunt work he does - - shooting skiers from head on while skiing backwards ! And some of the risks that don't quite come off - - a low-level flyover shot of Lake Tahoe that has to be redone after the plane doesn't quite clear the trees afterwards . All done for five seconds of a feature , five seconds that might not make it into the picture .
The Magic Act	Melies is best known for his 1902 version of VOYAgE DANs LA LUNE and he worked in an enormous variety of genres - - today we would call them genres , but at the time , he was just turning out stuff to fill in at his theater and to sell to people who wanted to show movies . But he began as a stage magician and although he incorporated stage magic into his films and invented cinematic magic via cuts , masking and other method , he remained a magician to the end and this film , about two minutes in length , is the best pure example of stage magic in his surviving films . Yes , there are lots of camera tricks , but it comes out as stage magic . And , looking at recent movies about stage magicians , like THE PRESTIEGE , you begin to see how much presence the role requires - - and he has it . This is one of the many previously lost or infrequently seen Melies pictures that have been made available by Serge Bromberg , David Shepherd and a myriad of other hands in the newly issued DVD set GEORGES MELIES : FIRST WIZARD OF CINEMA . Required viewing for anyone interested in the history of movies . . . . . and a lot of fun .
