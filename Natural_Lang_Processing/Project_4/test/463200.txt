Stupid , racist , sexist , war-loving garbage	The Russians fly all the way into the middle of the US and attack . A small , untalented group of Brat Packers escape and fight them . First off - - it's incredibly stupid - - there was NO WAY the Russians could get that far into the US without being spotted . There are many other horrible things about this movie - - women are treated like dirt ; boys are told NOT to cry after their parents are gunned down - - what horsest ; a bunch of teenagers are able to hole up in the mountains and destroy tons of Russians single-handedly ; all the Russians are monsters ; it has an incredible amount of violence and it's rated PG-13 ; nobody can act ( I like Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze , but they're horrible here ) . This film does have a place in cinema history - - it was the first movie to get a PG-13 - - but that's about it . This movie celebrates war , violence and tells guys to be emotionless , killing machines . Maybe I'm taking this stupid movie too seriously , but everyone else seems to like it . I hated it in 1984 . . . I still hate it now . For war-lovers and women-haters only .
I'm ashamed to admit that I saw this in a theatre in 1978 . . .	and liked it ! BUT I was only 16 and I had never heard the Beatles originals ( I was a very sheltered child ) . I even bought the soundtrack ( which WAS a big hit ) . Then , a few months later , I heard the original songs by the Beatles and realized what a load of crap the soundtrack was . And a few years later I saw it again at a rundown revival theatre ( where it played with another bomb - - Spielberg's " 1941 " ) . I was fascinated and disgusted at the same time . Fascinated that ANYBODY would think this would work and get name stars and acts to participate ( this ruined Peter Framptons career and didn't help the Bee Gees either ) , and disgusted with what they did to the Beatles songs - - the worst covers were one of the Gibbs desecrating " Oh Darling " and Earth , Wind and Fire turning " Got to Get You Into My Life " into a disco song ! I'd love to know if any of the Beatles saw this and what they thought . One of the few people to survive with his dignity intact is George Burns and Aerosmith did do a GREAT version of " Come Together " . The plot was too silly for words and they used the flimsiest excuses to cram in any Beatles song - - for example , two characters are named Strawberry Fields and Mr . Mustard ( sigh ) . Worth seeing if you're drunk - - then it might actually look pretty good . Better yet , get a group of friends , everybody get drunk , pop this in and you got a real party on your hands ! Heck , this might work even if everybody is sober - - they'll be laughing themselves silly ! A definite must for all bad movie fans ( like me ) . Otherwise , this is one of the worst musicals ever made - - and I've seen " Xanadu " and " Can't Stop the Music " ! A true camp classic !
Horrible	Angelo Barberini ( Luke Kirby ) tells his all Italian family that he wants to move out ( at age 27 ) What he doesn't tell them is that he's gay . Then he meets hunky Nino ( Peter Miller ) a closeted policeman . They fall in love and begin to live together ( with separate bedrooms ) , but keep their relationship secret . Angelo wants to come out but Nino is dead set against it . Angelo finally does come out . . . and all hell breaks loose . Purported " comedy " is just horrid . This is 2003 - - do we need ANOTHER comedy about a gay man coming out ? ( Just for the record , I'm gay ) . That story has been done to death and just isn't funny or original anymore . The jokes are very obvious and there's tons of negative gay jabs ( all disgused as humor - - but nobody in my audience was laughing ) . There's nothing funny about the family's reactions and they seem way over the top for this day and age . I'm not Italian , but this movie seems to wallow in Italian stereotypes . Are all the mothers this cruel and overbearing ? Do they seriously expect their children to live with them until they get married ? Are they always yelling and throwing guilt around ? These are the same characters I've been seeing for years - - they weren't funny then , they aren't funny now . The film is colorful and Luke Kirby actually gives a very cute , funny performance . Paul Sorvino ( as Angelo's father ) isn't bad either and Claudia Ferri ( as Angelo's VERY neurotic sister ) has her moments . But everybody else is either shrill and overbearing ( Ginette Rene especially ) or bland . Peter Millar is TERRIBLE as Nino . He is tall , handsome and has a GREAT body . . . but he's so wooden and dull . I kept wondering what Angelo sees in him . Also , aside from one little kiss , we see no affection between these two men - - I didn't believe they were lovers at all . When they were being driven apart by their families , I could have cared less . Since they didn't seem to be in love , what were they losing ? Also this movie was leaden paced - - it was only 92 minutes but it felt like 3 hours ! Lousy jokes , homophobia disgused as humor , terrible acting and a ridiculously unconvincing ending which ties everything up neatly . A real waste of time . Avoid ! ! ! ! !
Well acted but sleazy and slow	Silly psychological drama about Ma Barker and her sons who robbed and killed in the 1920s . Roger Corman directed this . . . it seems like he was actually trying to do a serious movie . . . sadly , it doesn't work at all . This movie has a following but damned if I know why . It is very well-acted but the script and direction ramble all over the place . Also I found most of the actors dialogue unintelligible - - they're all putting on stupid Southern accents which don't help . Also , the movie is VERY sleazy . Rape , murder , incest , torture , beatings , drug abuse , homosexuality ( portrayed negatively unfortunately ) . . . you name it . I'm no prude , but this movie rubs your face in it . For instance , the opening scene has a young girl ( about 13 ) being held down by her brothers while her father rapes her ! This is ALMOST worth seeing to see Shelley Winters chewing the scenery as Ma and Robert DeNiro before he hit it big . All in all , a must miss .
Why ?	Fist off , remaking a classic horror film is a stupid idea . Second : adding blood and gore doesn't help . Third : Neither does nudity . Fourth : WHY ? ? ? POSSIBLE SPOILERSA pointless remake of a great horror film . In the original Simone Simon can't have sex with a man - - if she does she'll kill him . In this remake , the woman ( Nastassja Kinski ) has a brother ( Malcolm McDowell ) and she can only have sex with him and not kill him . Unfortunately she's in love with John Heard . Kinski is not a good actress - - never was . Having her nude throughout most of the movie doesn't help . McDowell really , really tries but he's given nothing to work with . Heard looks miserable ( understandably ) and poor Annette O'Toole does in famous pool sequence from the original topless . Why ? So we could squeeze some more gratuitous female nudity into this . Pointless , boring , not scary . If Schrader is so interested in nude females , why doesn't he just do a porno flick ? See the original .
Wow ! What a piece of crap !	A cyborg poses as a substitute teacher in schools and kills kids who are misbehaving . . . . yawn . Boring , suspenseless , lousy acting , stupid predictable script . . . a waste . The only thing that kept me watching was the guy who played the cyborg . He couldn't act his way out of a paper bag , but he was really nice-looking ! Other than that there's nothing worth watching here .
Bottom of the barrel here folks !	The last of the " Airport " sequels . This has Alain Delon and George Kennedy ( who was in all the Airport movies ) as pilots ; David Warner ( ! ! ! ) as the radio engineer ; Susan Blakely as a newswoman targeted for death ; Robert Wagner as a brilliant scientist ( stop laughing ! ) ; Eddie Albert as a president of the airlines ; Charo in a dreadful " comical " bit ; John Davidson as a newsman ( love how his hair stays in place even AFTER the plane turns upside down ! ) ; poor Martha Raye is humiliated ; Cicely Tyson plays a mother who is flying a heart for her dying son ( stop rolling your eyes ! ) ; Jimmie Walker as a clarinet player ( what did I say about not laughing ? ) ; Mercedes McCambridge as a Russian gymnastics coach ( OK you can laugh at that one ) ; Bibi Andresson as a hooker and Sylvia Kristel and Sybil Danning as love interests . Just pathetic . Full of stupid plots and dialogue that will have you roaring - - watch for Davidson getting " married " on the plane near the end ! The Concorde is taking all these people to Russia . They're attacked with missiles , escape , land safely in France and TAKE OFF AGAIN the very next day ! ! ! ! Don't you think the flight would have been cancelled or something ? Most of the acting is terrible - - McCambridge is a sight to behold in a red fright wig and a horrible fake accent . The only good acting is from Kennedy and Delon ( looking fantastic ) who gives a very engaging performance . Still that's not enough to make you sit through this drivel . Too long and lousy special effects too . This was a mega-bomb and ( thankfully ) stopped Universal from doing anymore .
Eerie , disturbing and altogether horrible	No real plot here - - just about the VERY weird , sick adventures of a young kid growing up in the middle on nowhere . Very stark with just gorgeous photography but filled with unpleasant characters , situations and depression . What's the point of all this ? Some people have compared this to David Lynch - - but Lynch has a REASON for his bizarre imagery and he has plots - - this movie has neither . I kept watching in the hope that it would all come together in the end - - no such luck . SPOILERIt does have a great closing sequence though with the little kid screaming full blast up into the sky . It hit me with a wallop - - maybe because I was feeling the same way ! Sure to depress you . A justly forgotten film . Avoid at all costs .
Dull dull dull	Antonio Banderas plays a rich Cuban man in the late 1800s-early 1900s , who orders a mail order bride ( Angelina Jolie ) . Unfortunately , she turns out to be a load of trouble . Horrible adaptation of a great book ( " Waltz into Darkness " by Cornell Woolrich ) . There's some beautiful set design , exotic locations and good acting by Banderas and Jolie . None of that can compensate for the leaden pace , horrible script , laughable performance by Thomas Jane ( who appears drunk most of the time ) and annoyingly jerky direction by Michael Cristofer . Also , why does this take place in Cuba ? The original novel is set in America . The only reason to see this tripe is for a very steamy sex scene between Banderas and Jolie within the first half hour . After that , tune out . ALMOST worth sitting through for the real stupid ending ( different from the book ) . A waste of talent .
Can I vote this a zero ?	A mad doctor ( Bruce Dern ! ! ! ) adds the head of a homicidal maniac to the body and head of a very big mentally-retarded man . The creature escapes and you can guess the rest . Truly horrible , sick horror film with an incredible amount of blood , sadism and sexual content for a PG rated film . The script is full of howlers and has severe continuity problems - - at one point Dern and his wife ( Pat Priest ) are seeing a friend out to his car . It's mentioned a few times that it's late at night , but it's clearly bright and sunny outside ! Also there is noisy , loud " music " in the soundtrack that will set your teeth on edge . As for the acting - - Dern looks miserable ( no shock there ! ) and walks through his role . Poor Pat Priest ! As his wife she's given nothing to do but be a victim or a sex object . She's assaulted ( while in a bikini ) , is tied up ( while in a very small nightgown ) , drugged , hit and locked in a cage ! The woman somehow maintains her dignity . Casey Kasem ( ! ! ? ? ! ! ) plays a best friend ( badly ) . And John Bloom as the mentally-retarded man gives new meaning to the word " wooden " . Everybody else is ever worse ! Bad dialogue , terrible acting , lots of gratuitous violence ( at one point a person's face is blown away ! ) and sex . It's almost bad enough to be good but it's in such incredibly bad taste . And there's a title song ( ! ! ! ) sung by the immortal Bobbie Boyle . Utter trash . Skip it .
If you're desperate . . .	Four college kids ( 2 girls , 2 boys ) must spend the night in a haunted house to get into the sororities and fraternities they pledged . What they don't know is the house IS haunted by a seemingly unstoppable killer . Who will survive ? Sound familiar ? A very by the numbers horror film utterly devoid of chills or imagination . It was one of the crummy films that everybody was making back in the early 1980s in the wake of the inexplicable success of " Friday the 13th " . This film DOES have Linda Blair in it . . . but she's pretty bad . The only good acting was from handsome , hunky Peter Barton who actually gave us a sympathetic character ( despite the lousy dialogue ) . The worst acting was by idiotic Vincent Van Patten . Apparently he was no joy on the set either . He was supposed to do a nude love scene with his costar ( not Blair ) but refused at the last minute - - he didn't want to tarnish his " image " ! Like being in something called " Hell Night " was going to give you a good reputation ! The movie has no nudity , very little swearing and next to no violence , blood or gore - - - how did this get an R rating ? Very dull - - not even good enough for laughs . Avoid .
Lord - - was this BAD ! ! ! ! !	An dreadful " update " of Flash Gordon . He's a small town athlete who father ( maybe ) died under mysterious circumstances . Through a bunch of silly events he goes to Mongo ( through a door between dimensions right out of " Sliders " ) along with his ex Dale Arden . There they meet Ming and his daughter who want . . . oh I give up ! This was just TERRIBLE ! ! ! I don't know why I thought Sci Fi would make a good series ( look at " Battlestar Galactica " ) but this is worse than I thought possible . There's no camp at all - - a serious mistake . That's what made the 1980 movie so much fun . Everything is done dead serious here . The actors are all certainly attractive ( especially Eric Johnson as Flash ) but the acting is just incredibly awful . I wasn't expecting Academy award performances but not THIS bad ! Everybody was so wooden ! They were hired for their looks and bodies - - not acting ability . However the script was so terrible - - boring and badly written - - that probably nobody could have been good . The special effects were ( even for Sci Fi ) terrible . Boring , badly updated , horribly acted . Hopefully this will disappear soon . If they camped it up it could only help .
Not as much fun as " Plan 9 "	Ed Wood's followup to " Plan 9 from Outer Space " . Lt . Bradford ( Duke Moore ) and patrolman Paul Kelton ( Paul Marco ) go investigate a deserted house where strange things are happening . There they find Dr . Acula ( sigh ) ( Keene Dunacn ) who's a phony spiritualist trying to bilk wealthy people by " contacting " their dead spouses . This is the legendary Wood film that sat unreleased for 25 YEARS because Wood couldn't pay the lab bill ! It has the typical Wood ingredients - - a bad script , lousy acting ( although Moore wasn't bad ) , a stubborn refusal to make sense and dreadful direction and editing . However it's not as bad ( or as funny ) as " Plan 9 " or " Bride of the Monster " were . This is just pretty boring stuff . It has some fun moments - - Tor Johnson's truly laughable makeup job and a bewildering séance ( where someone is shot at multiple times and someone is knocked out cold - - and no one bats an eyelash ) but it's mostly just dull . Even Criswell ( narrating from a coffin this time ) seems to just be going through the motions . And good luck explaining what the Black Ghost is doing in this ! Pretty bad . . . even for Wood . I give it a 1 .
Horrible is right !	Two dumb 20 somethings , Jason ( Robin Askwith ) and Judy ( Vanessa Shaw ) travel to a remote castle in the middle of nowhere in England - - him for a vacation , her to meet her aunt ( Ellen Pollock ) . Unfortunately , the place is run by mad Doc Storm ( Michael Gough ) who , with the aunt and his dwarf assistant ( Skip Martin ) have some interesting ideas for the two . The film opens with a great double decapitation and has a creepy moment when Shaw discovers a " dormitory " but that's about it . The plot is vague . . . to put it nicely and has really stupid dialogue and scenes ( i . e . Doc Storm tells Jason all about his experiments out there . . . for no reason at all ) . There's plenty of blood but the " special " effects are pitiful and there's way too much gratuitous female nudity - - one very ugly scene has a nude women brutally beaten to death with a cane . Also the movie moves very slowly and is dull . The acting varies : Askwith is ugly and annoying with a horrible 70s hairstyle ; Shaw is beautiful but wooden ; Pollock looks embarassed . . . only Gough seems to be enjoying himself while chewing the scenery as Storm . Skip Martin , on the other hand , REALLY overacts . . . he makes Gough look like a Method actor ! I give this a 2 for Gough and the cool guys in leather on the motorcycles . Otherwise this is vague , boring and stupid . Don't bother .
Easy to see why this failed !	Lauren Tewes and Vicki Lawrence play buddies looking for men . Twews plays the gullible young perky one . Lawrence plays the old more sensible one . I think I watched half of one episode and was truly astounded at how UNfunny it was ! It opens with the two of them walking into a bar . They observe a guy bending over and make comments on his butt ! THAT'S just the opening . . . and the jokes actually get worse ! When the best lines are about a guys butt you know you're in trouble . Lawrence and Tewes are ( were ) both good comedic actresses but even their talents couldn't save this . Tewes was ( I believe ) hooked on drugs at this time so she has an excuse for acting badly . Lawrence looks and acts like she's constricted by the material . Only of interest for seeing what Tewes and Lawrence did after " The Love Boat " and " The Carol Burnett Show " .
I remember when they were filming this in Boston . . .	it was great ! Lots of excitement . . . too bad the movie sucks . Someone is killing women in a school in Boston . That's basically it for the plot . It's slow , dull with no gore ( except for one very unpleasant scene ) . The only reasons I'm giving this a " 2 " instead of a " 1 " are : Rachel Ward - - she's very good ( despite the material ) and extremely beautiful and Boston itself . It looks great on the screen and the sequences in Beacon Hill perfectly capture the look and feel of the area . Ward herself was once asked about this movie . Her response ? She said it was a terrible movie that she was dreadful in ( I disagree with the last part of that statement ) . So , it's ALMOST worth seeing for Ward and Boston . Basically this is a boring , dull slasher movie . Avoid .
Justly forgotten	Boring , utterly predictable soap opera . Mary Tyler Moore is married to Ted Danson who's having an affair with Christine Lahti . Moore is friends with Lahti and doesn't know about the cheating . Danson dies in an accident and Lahti is pregnant with his baby . YAWN ! I'm ashamed to admit I paid money to see this in a theatre in 1986 . I liked all three stars but even their considerable talents couldn't pull this off . I CONSTANTLY knew what was going to happen . Like another poster said - - this plays like a PG-rated Lifetime movie . It does have Lahti swearing nonstop at one point and even Moore lets loose once ! Also there's a pointless shots of topless women playing football ( ! ! ! ) . Other than that it's TV friendly . The only good thing about this was Timothy Gibbs playing Moore and Danson's teenage son . Very handsome and quite a good actor . That aside there's nothing to recommend this . You've seen it before . . . and done better . It's obviously been forgotten . Skip it .
Not really a horror film	A bunch of gangsters holed up in a remote ski cabin face off against a giant monster . . . or something . But that doesn't really happen until the last 10 minutes or so ! The rest is just a so-so gangster drama dealing with the members and their interactions . The monster is just incidental to the plot . The movie isn't terrible . The script is OK ( if predictable ) and there's a very good performance by Sheila Carol . Also they manage to actually work up a few scary moments . But the rest of the acting is lousy , there's endless padding ( even at 65 minutes ) and it's never explained what the monster is or how it came into being ( it's suggested once . . . then dropped ) . I've seen worse but I've seen better too . An OK time waster - - nothing more .
I never liked hip-hop so obviously I didn't like this	Hilariously obvious " drama " about a bunch of high school ( I think ) kids who enjoy non-stop hip-hop , break dancing , graffiti and trying to become a dj at the Roxy - - or something . To be totally honest I was so bored I forgot ! Even people who love the music agree this movie is terribly acted and - - as a drama - - failed dismally . We're supposed to find this kids likable and nice . I found them bland and boring . The one that I REALLY hated was Ramon . He does graffiti on subway trains and this is looked upon as great . Excuse me ? He's defacing public property that isn't his to begin with . Also these " great " kids tap into the city's electricity so they can hold a big dance party at an abandoned building . Uh huh . So we're supposed to find a bunch of law breakers lovable and fun . I could forgive all that if the music was good but I can't stand hip hop . The songs were - - at best - - mediocre and they were nonstop ! they're ALWAYS playing to the point that I was fast-forwarding through the many endless music numbers . ( Cut out the music and you got maybe a 30 minute movie - - maybe ) There are a few imaginative numbers - - the subway dance fight , a truly funny Santa number and the climatic Roxy show . If you love hip hop here's your movie . But it you're looking for good drama mixed in - - forget it . Also HOW did this get a PG rating ? There's an incredible amount of swearing in this .
Kind of dull	A movie about Vixen ( Erica Gavin ) who has a Mountie husband who she loves . . . but she loves sex too ! In the course of the movie she gets multiple men in bed - - including her husband AND brother ! Also there's a ( tame ) lesbian sequence . This film put Russ Meyer on the map and was ( I believe ) the first critically acclaimed X rated film ever . It was a big hit when it came out . Unfortunately , it doesn't date well . It is well-directed and Erica Gavin is just great ( whatever happened to her ) , and it was VERY colorful . . . but by today's standards it's extremely tame . I'm surprised it has an NC-17 rating now - - there's no hardcore sex and it only has topless females and no male nudity at all . Also it's ( sadly ) pretty dull and the addition of politics at the end was confusing ( and pretty silly ) . It is worth catching though to see what was considered very shocking in 1968 . Purportedly I saw the cut version ( which has an R rating ) but I've heard only a few seconds here and there are missing . Meyer's next film " Beyond the Valley of the Dolls " is much better and dates VERY well . Catch that instead .
Pretty silly but not without merit	Susan Jane is pretty but feels ignored by kids at school . They never invite her to parties or engage her in conversations . On the other hand the kids don't purposely ignore her - - they just think she's stuck-up because she never talks to them ! One kind girl in the group realizes the situation and talks to Susan Jane and everything ends happily . At first I was howling at this . It was made on no budget and , with the sole exception of the actress playing Susan Jane , the acting is dreadful . BUT it does deal with a problem that all teenagers deal with at some time or another - - feeling left out or not part of the group . If got better when I realized this and brought me back to my own teenage years ! So it's pretty dated but it sends a message to teenagers and actually is pretty good all around . Still the atrocious acting really hurts - - I can only give this a 5 .
Well-acted but dull	POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD True story about John Forbes Nash Jr . ( Russell Crowe ) , a brilliant mathematician , and his struggles with schizophrenia . Well-acted by Crowe , Jennifer Connelly ( as his wife ) , Ed Harris ( as a government agent ) and Paul Bettany ( as a college roommate ) but dull dull dull ! ! ! It's needleslly long ( over 2 hours ) , very slow and I had a hard time staying awake . A few people walked out after about an hour - - I wish I had joined them . This movie purports to be a true story . It isn't . They make Nash into a saint-like character . In real life he cheated on his wife ( with women AND men ) , was addicted to drugs and divorced her . All this is left out of the movie to make him more acceptable for mainstream audiences . Basically though , they're lying . They end up making his character boring . Only Crowe's acting gives his character any depth . The film just moves at a turtle's pace with characters talking and talking and talking endlessly about boring subjects ( the schizophrenia doesn't kick in until after an hour ) . Only the acting is good . Anyways , this film was made for only one reason - - to win Oscars . It has a very cold , calculated feel about it . Everybody looks perfect , everything looks beautiful , there's a big lush musical score , the schizophrenia is presented tastefully - - nothing to offend anybody . That is the type of film that wins Oscars - - sadly this cleaned up at the Golden Globes so the Oscars might happen . It's just annoying that this movie says it's all about schizophrenia and trying to make the public aware of it , when it's actually all about winning awards and nothing more . Predictable , boring and calculating . Avoid .
Boring and clichéd	In WWII Navajo men were used as code talkers in the war - - they translated messages while in combat into their own language , and transmitted it that way . This was done so the Japanese were unable to understand the messages . It's a very interesting little known fact about the war . It's a good thing they made a movie about it - - it's too bad the movie is so lousy . SPOILERSEvery single clichéd line and character found in WWII movies are all here . There's the sergeant who is suffering from a former war trauma ; the eager young kid ( who you know is gonna get it ) ; the racist ( who sees the error of his ways ) ; the nice guy who is horrified by what he sees ; the saint-like Navajos etc etc . The dialogue is astonishingly bad . I've heard these same lines from other war flicks - - some of them are lifted verbatim ( it seems ) ! Every single line and conflict is predictable . I was able to tell in the first 20 minutes who was going to die - - that's how predictable this is ! I almost left but the movie DOES have it's good points . For one thing , war is not glorified . The battle sequences are bloody , loud , very graphic and upsetting . . . as they should be . However , director John Woo has always been good at shooting violence . Also there's no stupid obligatory romance - - heck , there's virtually no females here ! There's some good acting also - - Adam Beach as one of the Navajos is fantastic - - handsome , intelligent if a little too saintlike . Mark Ruffalo is also affecting and Christian Slater ( not playing a jerk for once ) is excellent . Unfortunately , Nicholas Cage gives another lousy performance as the main character . Can we take back the Oscar he got for " Leaving Las Vegas " ? So , aside from some good acting and extreme violence ( be warned . . . it's VERY explicit . . . some people walked out because of it ) , I can't recommend this . Too bad . . . the subject matter is so interesting .
About what you'd expect	An innocent girl , Ann ( Jill Ireland ) is framed by an evil girl , Lucy ( Jocelyn Britton ) and sent to a borstal ( British girls prison ) . There we have an evil prison guard , suicides , cat fights , riots and a strong suggestion of lesbianism . For what it is , it's not bad . It's made in bright , strong colors and has a fairly decent script . Jill Ireland is actually pretty good as Ann , Sheila Whittingham is equally fine as a fellow inmate and Ellen Pollock amusingly chews the scenery as the evil Miss Smith . Also the lesbian suggestions were pretty strong for its time . But I can only give this a 5 . For some reason , they play sleazy music almost constantly in the background . It never matches whats playing on the screen and totally destroys any dramatic impact . Also , you can tell the actors are doing a good job , but the music is really distracting . At some points the music almost drowns out the dialogue ! What's the point of all that ? So , without the music I would probably give it a higher rating but , as it stands , I can only give this a 5 .
Highly unbelievable but fun . . . sort of	Nerdy high school student Ronald ( Scott Jacoby ) accidentally kills a fellow female classmate who is making fun of him ( he pushes her and her head hits a brick ) . He goes home and tells his VERY overprotective mother ( Kim Hunter ) . She decides to help him . She has him cover up the door of the guest bedroom and have him hide in there . Then she goes to the hospital for an operation . . . and dies . Ronald finds out and begins to go crazy . Then a family moves in with some beautiful teenage girls . . . Highly improbable TV movie . I saw it on TV back in 1974 when I was 12 . I watched it cause it was being sold as a horror movie but , even at that age , I quickly realized how silly this was . A mother protecting her son when he murders someone ? A family moves into a house and doesn't notice a whole section sealed off ? And Ronald has holes in the wall to look out - - and nobody notices ? ? ? ? ? The stupidity level is high here . Also it has a bad title and a lousy ending But , in a way , it's kind of OK . Jacoby isn't bad and Hunter has always been good . For a quickly made TV movie it's not bad . Still . . . nothing to seek out . I give it a 5 ( mostly for the acting ) .
Great action - - too bad the plot keeps getting in the way	The plot is boring and by-the-numbers gangster stuff ( and has only the slightest relation to " Romeo & Juliet " ) . The performances are terrible especially Jet Li and the soundtrack is unbearable ( I counted at least 40 uses of f and b in the first half hour ! ) . This film is ALMOST worth seeing for the action sequences . They are truly incredible and very entertaining . If only the director didn't keep falling back on MTV-style editing ( the camera changing angles ever second or so ) . When Jet Li is fighting , just train the camera on him and keep it still ! So , worth seeing for the action , but don't pay full price . Also bring ear plugs for the soundtrack !
More silly than anything else	This is a review of the silent version without the narration . Silent documentary about witchcraft throughout the ages . It uses drawings , diagrams and recreations about witches , the Devil and Hell ( all connected together according to this ) . I saw it because I heard it was a masterpiece of horror and I love horror films . I was unimpressed . I found it slow and pretty silly - - the view of Hell using cutouts and puppets was ridiculous but the guy in the Satan outfit was downright hysterical ! The recreations were broadly acted ( even for a silent film ) and dragged slowly by . The only surprises were a few fleeting glimpses of female nudity . Basiaclly this didn't tell me anything I didn't already know about witchcraft . It came across more as a boring ( and funny ) history lesson than anything else . It gets a 6 for a few good moments and some well-directed sequences but I can't really recommend this .
Just OK	Story about American Simon Wells ( Macdonald Carey ) meeting British Joan ( Shirley Anne Field ) in England and being attracted to her . Her brother ( Oliver Reed ) has obvious incestuous feelings for her and intends to kill Simon . While they're running from Reed and his gang Simon and Joan come across an isolated government facility by the British seaside . Inside are a number of young children who are being injected with radiation so they'll be the survivors of an imminent nuclear war the British see coming . Strange film for Hammer pictures . It's bleak , negative and has no happy ending . Also it doesn't have Peter Cushing of Christopher Lee around - - but Oliver Reed makes up for that . I also realize it has a cult following but I really can't see why . The script is slow-moving with some bad dialogue and , with the sole exceptions of Reed and Field , the acting is pretty lousy . Viveca Lindfors ( playing a lesbian ) tries but can't bring anything to her character at all . The children themselves are so emotionless and matter of fact that you don't believe or even care much about their situation . There are some good moments at the end when the kids try to escape but that's about it . On the plus side it is well-directed and there's some beautiful wide screen black & white cinematography . . . but I was mostly bored . This was unreleased in the US until 1965 and it was cut by 17 minutes when it did show up . The idea that a government would be experimenting on children was pretty horrific and controversial for 1961 . The complete version is the one playing on TV . Sci-fi fans might like this one .
This is supposed to be funny ?	I didn't laugh much . It's a pretty sad tale about a young man ( Tom Courtenay ) in a dead end job with an unhappy home life who lies and constantly escapes into a fantasy world . I got most of the jokes ( sometimes the English accents are hard to understand ) , but they just weren't very funny . Also the satire of the business world was pretty dated . It is worth seeing for beautiful black & white photography ( you have to see it letter-boxed or on a big screen - - there's no other way ) , good acting and directing and a marvelous performance by Julie Christie . When she was on screen that movie zoomed to life . She's so young and beautiful and full of spunk - - too bad she's only in the last section . So , worth seeing , but no masterpiece .
Sick , violent , pitch black comedy / detective movie	Harry Lockhart ( Robert Downey Jr . ) through a bunch of experiences too convoluted ( and unbelievable ) to explain ends up solving multiple murders with gay Gay Perry ( Val Kilmer ) . Involved is beautiful Harmony Faith Lane ( Michelle Monaghan ) . This film definitely has its audience . The reviews here are positive and critics are falling all over themselves praising . I HATED this film myself . For starters it's one of those films where they give you a likable character ( Downey ) and have him beaten up multiple times , shot at , mutilated , tortured . . . all for laughs . Also the movie is broken up into four days ( I think ) and each day is " named " with a title from a Raymond Chandler novel . This isn't cute or amusing . . . just stupid . The plot is also VERY convoluted - - it's almost impossible to follow at times . And there's virtual non-stop swearing . And I got pretty disgusted with scenes of gruesome violence played for laughs . I stayed with the movie for a few reasons - - Downey was superb ( and narrates the entire film ) ; Kilmer very nicely underplays his role and the dialogue IS sharp and good . But I was either puzzled , sickened or just plain BORED by this movie . This is a pitch black comedy - - TOO black for me . I give it a 6 for Downey and Kilmer alone .
Not as bad as I heard it was	This unremarkable film got a lot of notoriety in the 1970s when it was included in the book " The Fifty Worst Films of All Time " . The film isn't good but it's nowhere near one of the worst films ever made ! Mary Hagen ( Shirley Temple ) is believed to be the illegitimate child of Tom Bates ( Ronald Reagan ! ) . He left town when she was a baby and Mary was adopted by the Hagens - - a kindly elderly couple . He returns when she's 18 and in high school . The rumors start up again and the town starts to do everything to make Mary feel like it's her fault that she's illegitimate . This easily has some bizarre casting . Temple maybe being the illegitimate kid of Reagan is pretty silly but then we have Lois Maxwell as a kind teacher and Rory Calhoun playing her boyfriend ! Casting aside this film is obvious and pretty silly by today's standards . The script is dreadful - - full of bad dialogue and incredibly clichéd situations . A deathbed confession actually had me laughing out loud ! Still , it is a somewhat interesting view of how small towns ( and minds ) treated illegitimate kids back in the 1940s . The acting is pretty bad by the leads - - Reagan seems unsure of what he's doing and seeing Temple trying to act - - well it's not pretty ! Maxwell and Calhoun easily give the best performances . This was well made on a small budget and was ( for its time ) a pretty risky subject . Worth seeing for camp value alone . Wait'll you see Temple playing Juliet in the school play ! Most puzzling line : " Why don't you go away and catch yourself you foul ball ! " ( ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? )
THIS was a big hit ?	Possible spoilers I've heard this was a big hit in 1955 . It certainly doesn't age well . It's half a good movie . It begins with playboy / agent Frank Sinatra seeing multiple women . . . but Sinatra was hardly a good-looking man - - it strains credibility that all these gorgeous women are flinging themselves at him . Also , the scenes of him with his shirt off are not pretty . He falls in love with young , naive Debbie Reynolds . . . but he doesn't want to get married and she does . His friends ( Celeste Holm and David Wayne ) watch on with amusement ( and give out dynamite performances ) . The first hour is pretty good - - funny , fast-moving and Holm , Wayne and Sinatra shine ( Reynolds gives out a bad performance , but it's not entirely her fault - - her role is badly written ) . Then , after about an hour , the film turns all serious and melodramatic and falls apart . It suddenly moves VERY slowly , throws in very dated ( and offensive ) sexual politics and Holm's character is treated cruelly . It picks up at the very end , but it's too late . So , it's worth seeing for Holm , Wayne and the first hour . After that , switch it off .
Martin and Tomlin are great . The movie isn't .	Rich and dying Edwina Cutwater ( Lily Tomlin ) is arranging to have her soul transferred into the body of a young beautiful woman ( Victoria Tennant ) just after she dies . Instead it gets sent to the body of stuffy lawyer Roger Cobb ( Steve Martin ) and both of them fight to gain control . This is not a great movie by any means . It's really not all that funny ; it's flatly directed by Carl Reiner ; Tennant is terrible at comedy ; there's some highly unlikely situations ( especially at the end ) and I didn't buy what happened to the main villain at the climax for one second . Still , Martin and Tomlin make this worth seeing . Tomlin technically isn't in it that much . After she dies ( early on in the film ) you only see her as a reflection whenever Martin looks in a mirror or glass surface . It's a credit to her acting that you think of her even when she's not on screen . Martin had a VERY difficult role . He had to show male AND female characteristics in the same body at the same time . It's tricky but he manages to pull it off and he's actually pretty hysterical . Even people who hate this movie agree his performance is just incredible . There's a courtroom sequence at the end where he's just magnificent . The fact that he wasn't even nominated for an Academy Award for this is a crime ( although he DID win a Golden Globe ) . Don't miss the dance sequence during the closing credits . So , all in all , the movie has some great moments but doesn't really pull together . Worth seeing for just Matin and Tomlin . I truthfully can only give this a 6 .
Good acting but lousy film	Young English teenager ( Tushingham ) gets pregnant by a black soldier and ends up living with a gay guy . Considered strong in its day ( in England , no one under 16 was allowed in the theater showing this ! ) for its frank portrayals of interracial sex , homelessness and homosexuality . Seen today , its dated ( very ) and the film is slow and depressing . Also there is a horrendous music score - - it pops up every 10 minutes or so . . . it's this upbeat cheery music ( with a chorus of kids no less ) that is totally at odds with what's going on in the movie . It's jarring and extremely annoying . Acting is good , but it can't carry the whole movie . Also a VERY depressing ending ( with the cherry music screaming from the soundtrack ) . A waste . Tony Richardson directed THIS ? ? ? ? I'm giving it a six only for the acting and dealing with taboo subjects ( in 1961 ) .
Just about what you'd expect	" S . W . A . T . " was a by the numbers TV cop show from the 70s . It only lasted one season and its only claims to fame are that it had a young Robert Urich in its cast and had a really catchy theme song . The movie isn't much better than the show but it's not a total washout . Jim Street ( Colin Farrell ) and his partner Gamble ( Jeremy Renner ) are part of SWAT and on a mission . Gamble ignores a direct order and a hostage is wounded . Gamble is fired from SWAT and Street is sent to cage duty . Six months later Lt . Dan " hondo " Harrelson ( Samuel L . Jackson ) starts to head SWAT . He puts Street back on along with a few others ( the only standout is LL Cool J ) and they go into training . Then a vicious French killer ( horribly played by Olivier Martinez ) raises hell in L . A . and SWAT may have more than they can handle on their hands . As you can see this is , plotwise , an hour-long TV cop show extended to 2 hours . Ever twist and turn was boringly predictable . And we have too loud rock songs played over all the action sequences along with ear-splitting gun shots . Also there's tons of casual violence but no blood and gore ( maybe that's how it got by with a PG-13 ) and a surprising amount of swearing ( thank you " NYPD Blue " ) . Still , the dialogue wasn't half bad ; the action sequences were quick , loud and full of energy and everybody gives a good performance ( especially Farrell and Jackson ) . So , it's nothing new . . . but you could do worse . Not a film for small kids though .
" The Greatest Show on Earth " ? Hardly .	Brad Braden ( Charlton Heston ) runs the Ringling Bros . and Barnum & Bailey Circus . A trapeze artist named Holly ( Betty Hutton ) is in love with him but he doesn't feel the same way about her . A trouble-making trapeze artist Sebastian the Great ( Cornel Wilde ) joins the show and Holly starts competing with him . Angel ( Gloria Grahame ) an elephant trainer is attracted to Sebastian AND Brad . Buttons a clown ( Jimmy Stewart ! ! ! ) has a dark secret . The film also has insipid narration driving the story on . Overblown and silly but very colorful circus epic by Cecil B . DeMille . This was made with the complete cooperation of Ringling Bros . so a lot of their acts appear on screen . . . and that's the big problem with this . These acts which look fantastic live just don't come across on TV . I did see this on a large screen many years ago - - that way it worked . The acts are front and center and are lots of fun . On TV they just come across as boring and more than a little silly . It just doesn't work and there are LOTS of them . Add that to the fact that the stories are clichéd and full of unbelievable characters . We have some talented actors here giving their worst performances . Only Wilde and Stewart are good . There are good parts - - it is VERY colorful and there's plenty of cheesecake ( Hutton and Dorothy Lamour ) and beefcake ( Wilde is hunky and shirtless a LOT as are the other male trapeze artists ) . There's also a great train wreck at the end . Still this is overblown , far too long and just basically pretty dull . Hard to believe this won Oscars for Best Story and Best Picture . However this isn't the worst movie to be awarded Best Picture - - that " honor " goes to " American Beauty " .
Interesting but boring	Never thought a film about a gay cannibal could be dull but . . . The movie IS well-done . It's well-directed , the acting is great and it has a creepy , unsettling atmosphere ( as it should ) . It just gets bogged down , people acted REAL strange at times and just was downright dull ! Still , it all happened and the film has artistic merit . There just wasn't enough material for a feature length film .
What's all the fuss ? It's just OK	Batman redone . It gives us a new origin of Batman ( Christian Bale ) and how he got his powers and such . He still plays playboy Bruce Wayne while fighting evil as Batman . His first two villains are the Scarecrow ( Cillain Murphy ) who produces intense fear in his victim with a gas and Ra's Al Ghul - - who trained Batman and knows ALL his weaknesses . OK - - it's MUCH better then Tim Burton's dreadful movies but I still wasn't too impressed . I didn't like the new origin at all and it's a full hour before Batman even shows up ! It does have good parts - - Bale is dead on perfect as Bruce Wayne AND Batman . He also pumped up for the role ( we have at least two shirtless scenes ) . It LOOKS great ( if very dark ) and it has elaborate special effects left and right ( with tons of explosions thrown in too ) . But I was mostly bored . The training sequence at the beginning just went on endlessly - - it was more like The Shadow's origin than Batmans . Also this movie was WAY too heavy on darkness and atmosphere . At one point it was raining and I noticed nobody in Gotham pulled in their clothes from their lines . This isn't nit picking but obviously it was all out there to add an " atmosphere " to the scene . Also when you find yourself worrying about little things like that the movie just isn't doing its job ( i . e . entertaining you ) . However Batman's costume , the Batcave and the Batmobile are all explained pretty logically . Acting varies - - Bale was just great . Michael Caine ( as Alfred ) matched him . Even Katie Holmes ( a limited actress ) was good - - too bad she won't be in the sequel ( this inexplicable romance / marriage with Tom Cruise is destroying her career ) . Laim Neeson was very dull as a teacher - - he appeared to be drugged out . Gary Olman was ( suprisingly ) terrible as Jim Gordon - - he seems VERY unsure of how to play the role . But Rutger Hauer , Linus Roache ( who bears an uncanny resemblance to Bale ) and Morgan Freeman were all great . To be totally honest I looked at my watch more than once . I couldn't wait for this thing to get over . All the praise this is getting is beyond me . I give it a 7 - - and that's mostly for the acting .
Worth seeing , but no great shakes	The plot is ridiculous ( widowed man unknowingly falls in love with woman who has his dead wives heart ) and the stars are not suited to do romantic comedy ( Driver looks miserable , Duchovney ( sp ? ) looks REAL uncomfortable ) . Still the movie works . The whole supporting cast is wonderful ( O'Connor , Loggia , Grier , Belushi and especially Hunt ) , Chicago looks stunning , and the whole movie is very sweet-toned and friendly . It's never as romantic or as funny as you might hope , but it's a very pleasant movie . There are worse ways to spend $8 . 00 ! !
I didn't even know this movie existed . . .	it just happened to be on HBO while I was channel surfing . I came in a little late but when I saw gorgeous Stephen Dorff and always exceptional Susan Sarandon I decided to keep watching . I'm glad I did . The story is nothing new but I found the dialogue very interesting ( until the end where it got very predictable ) and Dorff and Sarandon are obviously enjoying themselves and play off each other very well . Dorff proves here he's not just another pretty face - - he's a very talented actor who just happens to be extremely good-looking and have a nice body . Sarandon is always good and extremely sexy in anything she does . The sexual tension between her and Dorff is extremely well-done . As I said before , the dialogue was very well-written ( for a TV movie ) and the two actors give it their all - - heck , these two could read a phone book and make it interesting ! The movie does disappoint at the end when Elizabeth Moss joins them . She's not a bad actress but her character is ( purposely ? ) very annoying and cruel . SPOILER AHEAD ! ! ! I also didn't buy Sarandon's decision at the end in the least . She should have stayed with Dorff - - I can't believe Dorff ended up with his annoying girlfriend . Still , it's played as a happy ending . So , all in all , I did enjoy this . Don't go out of your way to see it but it's worth catching .
Good , but not great	An executive at a movie studio ( Tim Robbins ) accidentally kills a writer who he thinks is harassing him . He tries to cover it up . Also his job at the studio is in jeopardy as he's competing with a younger , aggressive man ( Peter Gallagher ) . This was Altman's first Hollywood film after a 12 year absence ( " Popeye effectively stopped his career ) . At first I hated this movie . Very cold , VERY cynical with not one likable character in it . Slowly , though , it won me over . Basically , it's a satire of Hollywood and movie making . . . but a very vicious one . The script is great ( there are countless great lines ) and Altman does his usual great directing job . . . I love the opening 10-15 minutes which is done without any cutaways - - just one long shot . It's just too cruel at times . The acting is ( with one exception ) fine . Gallagher is dead on perfect as the young hot-shot ( he was in his 30s when he did this but he looks in his 20s ) . Robbins , however , is a disappointment . He has a blank , depressed look on his face during most of the movie and sleepwalks through his role . In a way that's a good thing . If he had been real good and convincing in the role this would have been unwatchable . Also Whoppi Goldberg is hysterical as a police officer investigating the case - - watch for the scene with her and a tampon ! Also a huge amount of Hollywood actors appear playing themselves . It's a lot of fun in certain scenes playing " who's in this one " ? So it's good , but Altman has done better . . . like " MASH " and " Nashville " . However , this isn't as bad as his worst film ( " Popeye " ) . So , I ultimately liked it , but the first half was a trial to sit through . I give it a 7 .
Loud , abrasive , crude and edited but still funny	Comedy / drama taking place in NYC about meek , mild Felix ( George Segal ) ending up stuck with loud , obnoxious prostitute Doris ( Barbra Streisand ) . Naturally they hate each other and naturally fall in love . This movie is VERY loud ( basically because Streisand yells nonstop ) , the humor is pretty caustic ( Streisand thinks Segal is gay and throws quite a few homophobic jokes at him ) and is pretty risqué - - it was edited from an R rating but there's still plenty of swearing and sexual sequences . Still it is fun . Segal and Streisand work well together - - the script is full of one liners that they throw at each other full tilt . And it might seem strange that Streisand could convincingly play a prostitute - - but she actually looks very attractive here and pulls it off ( she played another one in " Nuts " in 1987 ) . This isn't perfect however . It seems a little bit too long and some of their arguing gets repetitive . Also there is annoying edit when Streisand says the word " f " . I'm guessing it was cut to get a PG rating but it renders one scene incomprehensible and I DID hear it in the video version released in the 1980s . What's the story ? Also there's a very ugly scene at the end where Segal humiliates Streisand in Central Park . Segal also shot some nude scenes which never made it into the final print . Still this is worth catching . I wouldn't let the kids see it though . This is pretty strong for a PG film .
Very interesting	A young man ( C . Thomas Howell ) is riding a car across the state . While riding through the desert he picks up a hitchhiker ( Rutger Hauer ) . Hauer tries to kill him but Howell pushes him out of the car . But ( somehow ) the hitcher follows him , kills people , puts the blame on him and almost tries to kill him . . . Strange movie . A combination horror / action film . It's never boring and really works on you ( especially if u see it on a big screen ) . The intriguing thing about this is that you're never sure why the hitcher is acting the way he does ( a one point Jennifer Jason Leigh's character screams " Why didn't he kill us ? " ) , WHO he is and where he came from . The film has an ending that is open to interpretation and really makes you think . How many horror films do that ? Even the acting is good . Howell , usually a terrible actor , is very good in this one . Hauer is just downright terrifying as the Hitcher . Leigh has nothing to do but it's always good to see her in anything . My only complaints are : it's TOO open at the end involving the Hitcher - - I wanted more clues and what happens to Leigh was really sick and unnecessary . This was blasted by the critics when it came out ( Siskel and Ebert said you had to be " subhuman " to enjoy it ! ) but has acquired quite a loyal following . Worth seeing but be warned - - there's some VERY graphic violence in this . I give it a 7 .
More hits than misses	Parody of teen movies in the spirit of " Scary Movie " . There is a bit of a plot modeled on " She's All That " . Hottie Jake Wyler ( Chris Evans ) bets that he can transform an " ugly " girl into a beautiful one by the prom . The plot is secondary - - there are constant sidetracks to parodies of tons of other films - - everything from " American Beauty " to " Risky Business " . Some of the jokes don't work , but they're coming so fast and furious that if it doesn't work , just wait a second . . . another one's coming . More of the jokes work than don't . No classic , but I enjoyed it . The acting isn't bad - - Chris Evans is too old for his role ( but then the entire cast is ) but he has nice comic timing - - and a very nice body too . Mia Kirshner is also funny playing his sister and aping Sarah Michelle Gellar from " Cruel Intentions " . Also Jaime Pressly is fun as a beyond belief b of a cheerleader . All the stereotypes are hit dead on and it even turns into a musical at one point ! High points are the parody of " The Breakfast Club " ( with Paul Gleason cheerfully recreating his role ) and a hilarious cameo by Molly Ringwald . Lots of fun .
Not bad	Michael Jennings ( Ben Affleck ) has his mind wiped out for two years to do a job for a corporation . He comes back with no memory of what happened . It seems the corporation has set him up to be killed . But why ? He has no memory . . . There's more but it gets really confusing to explain . The plot is , plain and simple , stupid . REALLY stupid . But that doesn't really occur to you until after the film because this film is full of exciting shoot outs , great car chases and some truly jaw-dropping stunts . Director John Woo proves , once again , that he's the best action director out there . The stupid plots and great action are his trademarks . . . and there's ALWAYS a scene with a white dove in it ( it's supposed to stand for redemption . . . or something like that ) . This is not one of his best films - - it's too complicated , a little too silly and goes on way too long - - but it's enjoyable way to kill two hours . And it's much better than his last film ( " Windtalkers " ) . Affleck is just unbelievably handsome and really good in this film . The closeups of his face are just beautiful ! On the other hand Uma Thurman ( as his girlfriend ) looks terrible - - messy hair and cruelly photographed . She's OK - - but she has no part to play . She's just the love interest . Aaron Eckhart is also pretty good ( and unrecognizable ) as the slimy villain . Surprisingly , this film has a PG-13 rating . With only one other exception ( " Mission Impossible 2 " ) all Woo films have R ratings or NC-17 . The reason is there is tons of violence here , but no blood or gore . And it's relatively restrained ( until the end ) . SPOILER BEGINS ! ! ! Did the final battle between Eckhart and Affleck have to be so violent ? SPOILER ENDS ! ! ! ! ! So , it's pretty good . I'm giving it a 7 .
Pretty good	A misguided ( not mad ) scientist has developed a telescope which is basically a giant magnet ( ! ! ! ) . With it he proposes to draw comets to the Earth ( for some reason ) and then send them back into space . The police warn him not to do it . He ignores them and immediately starts bringing in a comet . The police destroy his equipment . . . but it's too late . The comet is hurtling towards Earth spitting out huge fireballs causing destruction . The scientist can't send it back because his equipment has been destroyed . Superman tries to smash the comet but it's too strong for him ! What will happen ? One of the lesser Superman cartoons but still fun . This is the first where Clark Kent does NOT say " This is a job for Superman " before changing . And there's a sweet little kiss between him and Lois at the end . Worth catching but just OK .
A cult favorite	Blood-drinking killer clowns from outer space terrorize a small town . They shoot at people with guns that let out popcorn instead of bullets . They also capture them and keep them captive in cotton candy cocoons for later feedings . Mike ( Grant Cramer ) , girlfriend Debbi ( Suzanne Snyder ) and policeman Dave ( John Allen Nelson ) try to stop them and save the town . The premise is ridiculous . . . but this film never really takes itself too seriously . The jokes are sometimes predictable but , more often , very clever and original . Also there are some very inventive , funny ways people are captured . But I can't say I really loved this movie . It is camp but the humor has a very cruel edge to it . People are killed pretty viciously and there's nothing funny about that . The clown makeup is downright horrifying and their laughs are nightmare inducing . It was made on no budget but there are some truly impressive sets and costumes - - it LOOKS like a big-budget film . Most of the acting is OK . Snyder makes a very appealing heroine and Nelson is very good as a straight arrow cop . Cramer is the only disappointment - - he overacts WAY too much . I'm giving it a 7 but I can't honestly say I liked this . It was a bit too dark and cruel for me - - but others might like that .
Not needed and WAY too long	Remake of the 1933 classic about a giant ape in love with a woman . I want to start of by saying I like ALL of director Peter Jackson's films - - until this one . Every director has their bad films - - even Hitchcock had some bombs ( like " The Trouble with Harry " ) . In my eyes this is the first bad film from Jackson . For starters - - a remake wasn't necessary . Really - - the 1933 film is perfect - - why try to redo it ? Also it is TOO long ! This film does not need to run three hours - - it needed some heavy editing . The first hour alone is all characterization . That's usually not a problem but when all the characters are boring you could care less . The script is comic book level with lines no human being would utter . Also they drop some hints about one character ( played by Jamie Bell ) and some mystery about his background - - and then ignore it completely ! It didn't help that the three main actors gave their worst performances . They're all good - - but not here ! Watts and Black give one note performances and Adrien Brophy appears to be sleepwalking . I do realize they were reacting to nothing most of the time but they're even bad when there aren't any special effects ! The second hour on Skull Island was exciting - - full of great effects and fights . Still I've seen most of these creatures in the " Jurassic Park " films . The third hour was dull until Kong escaped then it REALLY picked up . But the ending at the Empire State Building went on MUCH too long . It got to the point where I just couldn't wait for him to drop . Also HOW did they get Kong from the island to New York on that ship ? It's never explained . Also the score was pretty monotonous . Some of the violence also is pretty extreme for small kids . The film did some things right . It kept the story in the 1930s and the film LOOKS fantastic . All the supporting actors were just great and made up for the lousy performances by the three leads . Kong himself looked great - - even if they did change him from an ape to a gorilla . Still the bad things VASTLY outnumber the good . I never thought I'd say this but even the 1976 remake was better than this ! That one at least moved , they explained how they got Kong to NY and it is kind of fun to see Jeff Bridges and Jessica Lange in a movie like that . I give this a 7 but that's for the special effects . Otherwise I didn't like it . Let's see if Peter Jackson can do a movie that runs only two hours !
A pretty good commercial film	Well another indie director goes Hollywood . Neil LaBute after " In the Company of Men " and " Your Friends and Neighbors " , turns out a pretty good commercial comedy drama . On those terms , it's good - - but when you compare it to his earlier films , it's really depressing . " In the Company . . " and " Your Friends . . . " were depressing but fascinating films about men and women and their interactions . This movie has no character development , tries too hard to be cute and quirky and ( worst of all ) has two hit men - - one philisophical and one a violent , profane lunatic . Gee , that's original ! The thing that makes the movie bearable is all the acting is good and some of the lines are hilarious . So , if you go in expecting a typical Hollywood film , you won't be disappointed .
Long , but pretty good	Adaptation of J . K . Rowling's very popular book is as good an adaptation as possible . . . but it doesn't completely work . The big problem was they were afraid to cut anything out of the book ( they'd have school children all around the world after them ) , so they try to put everything in and there's too much for one movie . Also it's a virtual word-by-word recitation of the book - - if you've read the book , you've seen the movie . This doesn't allow director Chris Columbus any leeway to change things or add his own personal stamp ( not that Columbus was ever an inventive director to begin with ) . So , it just ends up being the book visualized exactly as written . The acting is so-so . The kids picked to play Harry , Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger are pretty good - - not great , but certainly not bad . The adults vary wildly - - Maggie Smith and Zoe Wanamaker ( love her yellow eyes ! ) are just great as teachers at Hogwats . . . Alan Rickman , Richard Harris and Robbie Coltrane are horrible . . . they're REALLY not enjoying themselves . Also John Williams bombastic score is annoying . Still , it looks great , moves fairly quickly and there's a fantastic sequence showing a Quidditch game . So , it's OK but nothing great . Maybe if Spielberg had directed it . . .
Enjoyable but no great shakes	A kid at a military academy named Bud Hooper ( Tommy Dix ) sends a fan letter to Lucille Ball asking her to be his prom date - - despite the fact that he has a girlfriend , Helen Schelsinger ( Virginia Weidler ) . Ball accepts under the pressuring of her agent ( William Gaxton ) . Bud's two roomies ( Kenny Bowers , Jack Jordan ) are also hot for Ball . Add Nancy Walker and Harry James and his Orchestra and thing go barreling out of control . Not a great musical but enjoyable . The color is bright , the film is full of life and there are some very funny ( if dated ) lines . Most of the songs are unmemorable ( and go on far too long ) until the last one - - it's a great little number called " Buckle Down Winsocki " and easily stops the show . Acting - - well Ball is just incredible - - VERY sexy , funny and believable . Dix is just so-so as Bud , Weidler is good as his girlfriend . His two roomies - - one is OK ( Bowers ) but the other ( Jordan ) over OVER ACTS to a truly annoying degree . It reached the point that every time he was on screen I was cringing away . Walker's character is treated dreadfully - - she's the butt of some VERY cruel jokes . Still she manages to be funny regardless . Also this is one of you few chances to see Walker sing and dance ( pretty well ) and see Lucy sing ( although her voice is obviously dubbed ) . And there's Gloria DeHaven and June Allyson in bit parts ! Nothing great but I enjoyed it . If the songs had been better this would have gotten a 10 . As it is I'm giving it a 7 . Worth catching .
This could haven been much better	Forgotten movie which barely got a release . I didn't even know it existed until I saw it while casually browsing at a video store . Homeless teenager hooker Dawn ( Christina Applegate ) angers psychotic cop Lumley ( Eb Lottimer ) who wants to kill her . She runs into a nice , normal teenage boy ( David Mendenhall ) and , together , they try to get away from the cop . Supposedly factual movie on the lives of homeless kids in Vencie , California . It was obviously made on a VERY low budget and looks appropriately grimy and gritty . It is well directed and Applegate is just fantastic as Dawn . Mendenhall has his moments too and it has an incredibly sad ( but realistic ) ending . Still , two things really lessen this film . One is some truly terrible dialogue - - the situations are believable but the dialogue isn't . The second is Lottimer as the killer - - he's not a bad actor but his character is given NO depth or insight . Also the bursts of VERY graphic violence are jarring . With a little more polish to the script and more depth this might have worked . As it stands it's only worth seeing for Applegate and some nice direction . I can only give it a 7 .
Good horror anthology	Four stories written by Robert Bloch about various people who live in a beautiful , old mansion and what happens to them . The first has Denholm Elliott as a novelist who sees the killer he's writing about come to life . Some spooky moments and the twist at the end was good . The second has Peter Cushing becoming obsessed with a wax figure resembling his dead wife . The third has Christopher Lee who has a child ( Chloe Franks ) and is scared of her . It all leads up to a pretty scary ending ( although the ending in the story was MUCH worse ) . The last is an out and out comedy with Jon Petwee and Ingrid Pitt ( both chewing the scenery ) and a cape that turns people into vampires ! There's also a cute line about Christopher Lee playing Dracula . This is a good horror anthology - - nothing terrifying but the first one and the ending of the third gave me a few pleasurable little chills . Also the fourth one is actually very funny and Pitt makes a VERY sexy vampire ! Also the house itself looks beautiful . . . and very creepy . It's well-directed with some nice atmospheric touches . A very good and unusual movie score too . All in all a good little horror anthology well worth seeking out . Try to see it on DVthe Lions Gate one looks fantastic with strong colors and great sound .
Too much opera , not enough Phantom	The first talking version of the Phantom of the Opera ( played by Claude Rains here ) in love with beautiful opera singer Christine ( Susanna Foster ) . The film looks just stunning - - it deservedly won an Oscar for its incredible color cinematography . Everything looks perfect and Foster is just so incredibly beautiful in closeup . So it looks good but this film has big problems . For one thing there's too much opera - - WAY too much ! All the operas look good and the singing is good - - but I personally hate operas and I was bored silly . " Phantom " is supposed to be a horror film - - NOT an opera film . The Phantom himself doesn't show up until 30 minutes in ! And they give the Phantom an origin - - it's not bad but not needed . . . it was scarier knowing nothing about him . There's LOTS of lame comedy of suitors Anatole ( Nelson Eddy ) and Raoul ( Edgar Barrier ) vying for Christine's affections . And Rains scarred face at the end isn't remotely scary - - can't hold a candle to Chaney's 1925 version . And Eddy's acting was abominable - - he was hired just for his singing . It does have some good things : The Phantom's first appearance DID make me jump ; the chandelier dropping was very well done ; Rains gives an excellent ( and very sympathetic ) performance in the lead and Foster is pretty good too - - - and what a voice ! Nice score too . But it's not a horror film - - it plays like an opera drama with horrific touches . Still it should be seen just for the stunning color cinematography alone . For that I give it a 7 .
Pretty good - - for what it is	Sequel to " Halloween " picks up right where the original ended . Michael Myers is still on the loose and after Laurie Strode ( Jamie Lee Curtis ) who's lying drugged up in the hospital . Meanwhile Dr . Loomis ( Donald Pleasence ) continues his hunt for him all over town but Myers ( somehow ) knows Laurie is in the hospital and heads for it . . . This film starts off ( and ends ) with the song " Mr . Sandman " which , if you think about it , DOES fit the movie . This movie is not as good as " Halloween " . . . but how could it be ? Still this movie makes some serious mistakes . Myers is turned into a killing machine - - slaughtering people left and right for no reason . The first murder is totally pointless . His murders are VERY bloody - - totally the opposite of what the original was . He's also given a stupid back story which wasn't needed . There are huge script problems too - - Myers breaks into a school ( why ? ) and prints " Samhain " ( an ancient Druid saying ) on a blackboard - - how is a homicidal maniac going to even KNOW what Samhain is ? Curtis is comatose and near death at one point but she's next seen stumbling around the hospital . The front door of the hospital is unlocked but mysteriously becomes locked when Curtis is trying to enter . Also this is the darkest and most unpopulated hospital I've ever seen . Acting varies - - poor Curtis has to act drugged up the entire film and Pleasence is lousy ( but the dialogue he's given is pretty bad ) . On the plus side it IS well directed by Rick Rosenthal effectively using the wide screen ( try to see it letter-boxed ) . Rosenthal was criticized for all the explicit violence in the film but he said John Carpenter ( who produced the film ) shot all the gore inserts . It was never really resolved . So there are tons of things wrong with this film - - so why am I giving it a 7 ? It moves quickly , is well-directed and throws a gory death at you every 7 minutes or so - - you're never bored . So if you turn off your mind COMPLETELY this is lots of fun . If you don't - - you're gonna hate it . A good MINDLESS horror film .
Stupid , silly but fun	OK the movie is REALLY stupid and gruesome ( how did this get a PG-13 rating ? ) but I was very entertained and found myself giggling at every dumb joke ( and there are plenty of them ) . The acting is ( appropriately ) over the top and the movie moves VERY quickly . Great makeup and special effects too . So if you like grossout humor and have a strong stomah see this movie - - you won't be disappointed !
Good , but no masterpiece	In 1937 France , thief Pepe Le Moko ( Jean Gabin ) is hiding out in the city's notorious Casbah district . One step out of it and he'll be sent to jail . He falls in love with a high class woman , Gaby ( Mireille Balin ) but he must leave the Casbah to be with her . . . and the police are closing in . This is a good movie . . . at times a great one , but not the masterpiece I've heard it is . It drags at times and some of the subtitles read pretty stupidly . Also there's some truly ugly sexism on display . But , it's well directed by Julien Duvivier and Gabin was one hell of an actor . He's handsome , intelligent and full of charisma . In one great sequence , he's so happy that he's literally singing and you see how it affects everyone around him . Also Balin is beyond beautiful and Lucas Gridoux ( as a sleazy detective ) and Gilbert Gil are very good . And the ending is shattering and very moving . So . . . it's a very good French film . It's just been reissued in a beautiful new print ( as of August 2002 ) . . . try to catch it .
Not THAT bad	Charlotte ' Charlie ' is a young cute Latina that just can't find Mr . Right . Then she ( tiredly ) cute meets hunky Kevin Fields ( Michael Vartan ) a rich doctor who immediately falls in love with her . They agree to marry in record time . . . but Kevin's mother ( Jane Fonda ) is dead set against it and will do anything to stop it . . . I've heard all the bad press about this but I like Lopez , Vartan and Fonda so I saw it anyways . It's not great but it's not the disaster everyone says it is . The main problem is that it's not that funny . There are quite a few funny lines . . . but not enough for a feature length movie . Also seeing Fonda trying to stop Lopez is just horrible . Lopez plays such a sweet woman . . . it is not fun seeing her being tormented . But she does turn the tables ( eventually ) and then the movie kicks into high gear - - but that's not until the last half hour or so . Also there are more than a few lapses in logic - - Vartan and Lopez fall in love and agree to marry WAY too quickly and there's a scene in a hospital involving a fake doctor which could never happen in real life . Also Lopez has the now obligatory gay best friend - - nothing wrong with that but does it have to be in every movie ? For the record , I'm gay . Still I did like it . It looks great - - Fonda's estate is unbelievable and I did like most of the acting . Vartan ( introduced shirtless to show his buff body ) is given nothing to do but pulls it off ; Lopez ( surprisingly ) isn't that good - - she appears to be on Valium ; but Fonda ( FINALLY back in films after 15 years ) is great ! She tears into the part with gusto and really gets this movie going . She does look old - - but for 68 she looks pretty damn good . Also Wanda Sykes as her assistant Ruby is just fantastic . She easily has the funniest lines and steals every scene she's in - - although Fonda matches her . My audience loved it - - there was long , loud applause at the end . So . . . is this a great movie ? No , but I found it enjoyable . And it is great to have Jane Fonda back again . I give this a 7 .
Better than the original	Remake of the dreadful 1970 Jack Lemmon-Sandy Dennis " comedy " about a couple from Ohio who go to NYC ( for a job interview for the husband ) and have everything go wrong . The original was sick , morbid and had the very annoying Dennis . This one is funny , not hilarious , but funny . It has a better cast ( Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn are comedians - - Lemmon and Dennis weren't ) , and has John Cleese who is hilarious as a snotty hotel manager - - his dead pan delivery of all his lines really worked . Not a masterpiece but not the disaster I heard it was - - for instance the previous Hawn-Martin movie " Housesitter " was much worse . This moves quickly , has an excellent music score and the stars are both in top form . Worth seeing .
Dated but lots of fun !	Tommy is very 1970s - - the clothes , the music , the drugs . . . but it's lots of fun . Also if you came of age in that era ( like me ) , it's very nostalgic . The movie is stunningly directed by Ken Russell - - the imagery is astounding and manages to complement the music . The music is , for the most part , good , but the Who obviously made changes for the movie - - and not very good ones . The acting is all good , especially Ann-Margret who was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for this movie . I think she got nominated just for her sequence with the exploding TV ! Most of the singing is great ( Ann-Margret , Tina Turner , Elton John ) but there are a few who should never have been allowed to sing ( Oliver Reed , Jack Nicholson , Keith Moon - - he was a great drummer but no singer ! ) . My only complaint is it loses a lot on TV . I saw it in a movie theatre on a large screen and loud sound . It blew me away ! On TV , you don't get the same effect . Still , worth watching . If you get a chance to see it in a movie theatre , don't pass it up !
Quite interesting	Very good documentary . It's about two gay men ( Sam Cagnina and Stephen Margolin ) who want a woman in their relationship . They finally find Samantha Singh . They all live together and have sex together ( not shown ) . Then Samantha gets pregnant . They're all happy - - but the birth of a child sets off some unexpected feelings . . . and this family might not survive . I saw this at a film festival and , for some technical reason , they could only show it in black & white , not color . That may have affected my rating but I don't think so . This is a totally fascinating movie following a different type of family and how it works and survives . It was shot over the space of 8 years so you see them grow and change - - in good and bad ways . Totally absorbing but it is a little too long - - it could have been cut by a few minutes . Still it's an excellent documentary and should be seen by all open-minded people interested in a new type of family . Recommended .
Have never forgotten it	I was lucky enough to see a vault print of this in a revival theatre back in 1996 . The picture was crystal clear and it was projected on a huge screen . The only thing missing was the stereo soundtrack . Also it was the original uncut version which hasn't being shown in the USA since the film's premiere ! It's basically a love story set in Ireland . Sarah Miles is married to old but kindly Robert Mitchum . Their sex life is nonexistent . Then a young handsome officer played by Christopher Jones appears to deal with the IRA . The two of them fall in love which leads to numerous problems . I've never liked David Leans films . They LOOK great but the stories are almost impossible to follow . Like in " Dr . Zhicago " and " Lawrence of Arabia " he throws you into the middle of these conflicts and never explains what's going on ! This is an exception . I had no problem following the story and the scenery is absolutely breath-taking . . . but that's sort of a problem . This is basically a simple love story blown up into a HUGE production . The stunning photography overpowers the story more than once . The acting is good - - Miles was excellent and Mitchum downplayed his role nicely . I even thought Jones ( who I always thought was a TERRIBLE actor ) was good - - but I later on learned his voice was overdubbed . Still I found this a fascinating film - - well worth catching . . . but I'm not sure how it would hold up on TV . Also the version I saw had an incredibly beautiful and LONG sex scene between Miles and Jones . It's easily one of the most beautiful , erotic sexual sequence I've ever seen . . . but I think it's cut out or shortened on the American prints . Hopefully this will be on DVD one day with the sequence in intact . I give this an 8 .
Loved it in 1984 - - still love it	Father Tim Farley ( Jack Lemmon ) is a well loved priest in his church . He is given a month to teach headstrong Mark Dolson ( Zeljko Ivanek ) on how to tone his anger down and become a priest . He finds out Mark had gay sex before he decided to enter the Church . Unfortunately homophobic Monsignor Thomas Burke ( Charles Durning ) finds out too and wants him thrown out . Farley wants to stand up for Mark . . . but can he without getting thrown out himself ? Quite obviously this was a play but it still works . There's nothing great or flashy about the direction but it has a great script and two wonderful performances by Durning and especially Lemmon . I wish I could say the same about Ivanek but he comes across as too angry and stubborn - - it seems reasonable that he shouldn't be a priest . Still the issue about how the Catholic church views homosexuality is dealt with in a intelligent manner . As a lapsed Catholic myself I applaud the film for pointing out how biased and ridiculous their view is . I again have to say how good Lemmon is - - I don't think this man ever gave a bad performance and he's just perfect here . A few of his discussions with Ivanek are ( purposely ) very funny . The ending is sort of muted here . They didn't change it from the play but it doesn't hit as hard - - they didn't want to depress the audience I guess . For whatever reason this was barely released in 1984 . The studio was probably afraid of the Catholic church condemning it but that actually might have made it more popular ! Look at " Hail Mary " or " Last Temptation of Christ " . The very few reviews here show that it's still pretty unknown . That's a shame because it's a well-made and thoughtful comedy drama . Well worth catching . " Mark don't kick a ! " " It's better than kissing it . "
Underrated and , sadly , forgotten	Playwright Sidney Bruhl ( Michael Caine ) has had a series of flop plays after a huge hit . He receives a play written by a student of his , Clifford Anderson ( Christopher Reeve ) which is fantastic . It's so good Sidney says he would kill for it . Will he ? A thinking man's thriller . It was originally a play . . . and it shows . It's mostly on one set and all talk but I was never bored . It's very well-written with plenty of twists and a good cast working full force . Caine is just great as Bruhl - - another one of his great performances . Reeve is , surprisingly , very good . I never thought much of him as an actor , but he's really good in this role . Dyan Cannon does wonders with an underwritten role as Bruhls ' wife . Irene Worth is also good ( and quite funny ) as Helga ten Drop , a psychic . However , her accent did get on my nerves . Director Sidney Lumet does very well with his one set . The camera is always moving and keeps your attention going . EXTREME SPOILER DEAD AHEAD ! ! ! ! ! My only complaint is that two gay characters in this movie turn out to be raging sociopaths and it also contains one of the most unromantic kisses I've ever seen - - but these are mild complaints . A very good thriller . Critics hate this movie ( for some reason ) and it seems to have completely disappeared since it premiered in 1982 . That's too bad - - it deserves better .
Not for everybody	Bud Cort plays Brewster McCloud . He's a very strange young man who lives in the Houston Astrodome and is building a huge set of wings so he can fly . The movie is about him and his VERY odd assortment of friends and family . And how about the killer running around Houston strangling people and leaving bird droppings on them ? As you can see this is a very strange film . It's unlike anything director Robert Altman has ever done . The film isn't perfect - - it's too long , the weirdness wears you down at times , some of the humor is real sick and there are characters that are just disgusting ( Stacy Keach ) or too flat out weird , even for this movie ( Jennifer Salt ) ! And what's with the circus ending ( entertaining as it is ) ? Still I love this film . The story rambles all over the place but I was able to keep track of it . Altman packs the movie with plenty of bird imagery and references . He also pays homage to other films also - - most notably " The Wizard of Oz " ( right up to having Margaret Hamilton in the cast and check out how Salt is dressed at times ) . This really doesn't pull together in any way but it IS fascinating to watch . Also the cast is great - - with one exception - - Michael Murphy . He's miscast and looks miserable . But everybody else is perfect . Particular standouts are Cort ( very good in a difficult role ) , Shelley Duvall ( who usually annoys me to no end ) and Sally Kirkland ( looking absolutely stunning ) . Also there's a very cute injoke - - there's a quick shot of the poster for " MASH " in Duvall's apartment ! This film was overshadowed by Altman's " MASH " in 1970 . Also , the studio hated it and threw it away . Now , however , it is rightfully considered one of the best films of its decade . I highly recommend this - - but not for everybody . If you like a linear plot and easily defined characters , stay away .
Kind of fun	Short compilation of actors flubbing dialogue , old ads or commercials made by stars and some gag footage made specifically for Hollywood insiders . Not very well put together and it has its dull stretches but some highlights are : The Marx Brothers in the MGM logo roaring like the lion ( except for Harpo ) ; Bud Abbott flubbing his lines and swearing a blue streak ; James Dean doing a PSA for driving safely ( shortly before his death in an auto accident ) ; a truly hysterical Jimmy Fund ad with Joan Crawford wishing her children a good night ( and you specifically hear them say " Good night Mommie Dearest ) ; a very odd little film with Cecil DeMille and Porky Pig swearing ! No great shakes but a fun little movie . I give it an 8 .
Quirky doesn't even begin to describe this one	Musical about three friends - - Billy ( Jake Moreno ) , Rodel ( writer H . P . Mendoza ) and Maribel ( L . A . Renigen ) . They live in a small town named Colma , have just graduated from high school and aren't sure what they want to do . Billy wants to be an actor but isn't sure if he can do it . Gay Rodel doesn't know what he wants and can't tell his father that he's gay . Maribel is a friend of the two . Very odd movie . The music and songs are good ( if repetitious ) and there's a show stopper in a bar . There was also an excellent use of split ( or multiple ) screens and it was shot on beautiful locations . But the movie was too long ( 20 minutes could have been cut ) ; the acting wasn't that good ; Moreno is a handsome man . . . but not the best singer ; the characters were basically pretty obnoxious and there doesn't seem to be any point to it all . Also characters act strange for no other reason than to act strange ( Billy's manager especially ) . Still I did enjoy it ( mostly ) and the songs were good . You might like this . Definitely worth a look if you love musicals .
The first gay slasher film - - too bad it's not really good	Being a gay man and a horror movie fan I was really looking forward to seeing this . . . but it's really not that good . Film begins with two men making out in a car - - until they are attacked and beheaded by a guy in a Satan suit . The next day is Halloween and four gay friends are attending the party in West Hollywood . They all fit the typical slasher film stereotypes : the nice guy ( Dylan Fergus ) ; the innocent , nervous guy ( Hank Harris ) ; the party animal ( Andrew Levitas ) and the one who wants to be loved for his mind NOT his body ( Matt Phillps as a drag queen ) . While getting there they make fun of the guy in the Devil costume . During the night he stalks them . . . and kills them one by one . Who is he and why is he doing this ? Don't bother asking - - the film doesn't tell you ! The film is beautifully shot ( some VERY nice images here ) and the murder scenes are very gory and well-done . Also the actors were hired for their looks and bodies - - but they're really pretty good ! Fergus is handsome and likable ; Harris is a little TOO nerdy ; Levitas is drop dead gorgeous with a GREAT body . . . but overdoes it a little ; Phillips is excellent as the drag queen - - he looks stunning as a woman AND a guy . Also they are joined by Bryan Kirkwood who's pretty bad . He's obviously straight and seems uncomfortable . But there's two BIG problems with the film - - the script and dialogue . The script is chockful of stupid moments - - someone is killed on a crowded dance floor . . . and nobody notices ; the killer magically appears everywhere his victims are ; we never find out who he is or why he's doing this . One one hand I thought thought this might be a tribute to the stupid 80s slasher films which were ALSO full of stupid incidents . On the other hand I thought - - - is that something we should pay tribute to ? And the dialogue is just dreadful - - no gay man ( or straight man ) talks like these guys . But , all in all , it was fun seeing a slasher film with gay men and showing off some nice partial nudity ( no frontal but the guys are shirtless 90 % of the time and there is a group butt shot ) . I'm giving this an 8 because the guys were just incredible and gave good performances . . . but I can't say I loved this . Recommended for gay men and horror movie fans who have no problem with gay guys . There's also plenty of room for a sequel . Let's hope there is one - - with a better plot and dialogue .
Good comedy / drama	Leopold Dilg ( Cary Grant ) is falsely accused of arson and murder . He breaks out of jail and hides out with a clueless stuffy legal writer ( Ronald Colman ) and his assistant ( Jean Arthur ) who knows who Dilg is . Dilg ends up educating Colman's character into more liberal views and getting Arthur to realize true love . Also the movie brings up serious issues about mob rule and violence . No masterpiece , but a good solid film . Well-directed , it looks great and ALMOST all the acting is good . Grant and Colman are excellent but Arthur is shrill and annoying . . . a very bad performance . It's easy to see why she never became a big star . So , despite her , it's worth catching .
No classic but funny	I had heard about this for years but thought it was just a silly joke . Really - - " Bambi Meets Godzilla " . . . come on ! To my total surprise it played one night years later as part of an animation festival . I admit the credits were amusing and I broke out laughing at the end . . . but that was about it . The animation is terrible and , after seeing it once , it doesn't play well again at all . I think it gets all this attention just because of the title . So , worth catching once but it's just a one-joke film . That's all I have to really say but IMDb requires 10 lines of text for everything . That's kind of silly . I mean foe feature films it makes sense but for a 2 minute short ? ? ? ? ? How much can you say ? It's taking me more time to type this than it takes to watch this short . THERE ! I completed over 10 lines : )
Where has this disappeared to ?	I caught this neat little revenge film on cable back in the early 80s and have never forgotten it . It's a combo teen / horror / revenge movie . A bunch of bullies generally run the school and terrorize the students ( the teachers are never shown until the end ) . A new kid in school refuses to buckle under to them . They cripple him . They figure he'll now take orders . . . right ? Wrong . He takes a disturbing , bloody revenge on them . . . and things really go out of control . There's more to it , but I don't want to ruin it . This movie actually carries a strong message about power and its use ( and abuse ) . Well-acted by a very good cast ( even Andrew Stevens ! ) and well-directed on a very low-budget ( it does show ) . This is a big cult movie and a perfect example of the type of movie they showed in drive-ins ( remember them ? ) in the 70s . Well worth seeing . Good luck finding a copy - - I don't think it's on DVD yet and the video is long out of print . Look for Lani O'Grady ( from " The Waltons " TV series ) doing a topless scene !
Very funny horror movie spoof	Three teenage girls ( actually guys in drag ) are having a slumber party . They're afraid they're being stalked by a killer . If you're a horror movie fan like me you'll get a kick out of this . This movie gleefully tears into every cliché of the slasher films and turns them on their ear . The acting is good and the one-liners fly fast and furious . My favorite was when they find an Ouija board - - one " girl " says it was used to raise the spirits of the dead . Anyone responds drily , " Yes - - I'm sure that's exactly what the Parker Brothers thought when they released it . " Good luck finding this . I only saw it once at a Gay & Lesbian Film Festival back in 1996 or 97 . It was so funny though that it never left me .
A one of a kind	I caught this in Boston back in 1981 . They played it in the biggest cinema they had in 70mm and in stereo sound . I had only the slightest idea of what it was about but it sounded interesting . When I realized it was a caveman movie I almost left , but the beautiful wide screen cinematography kept me in my seat . Slowly it worked on me and by the end I was mesmerized . There's not really much of a plot - - the caveman discover fire and different sexual positions - - and there's no dialogue that we could understand but it didn't matter . The whole cast was excellent - - especially Ron Perelman and Rae Dawn Chong ( who had guts to do this ) . Their whole performances had to be done using some foreign language and body movement but they pulled it off . I heard Anthony Burgess was called in to develop the language used and coach the cast in how to use it . The cinematography is just breath-taking and the prehistoric animals look realistic all the way . I can't exactly say why I loved this movie but I did . 20th Century Fox deserves credit for actually acquiring the film and releasing it . Naturally it bombed badly here in the US but it seems I'm not the only one who likes it - - when I mention it to friends I just get a blank look back . I haven't seen it since 1981 but it's never left me . Try to see it on a big screen TV . I give it an 8 .
Not as bad as people say	Brother and sister ( Jesse Eisenberg and Christina Ricci ) are bitten by a werewolf . They realize they are cursed and slowly changing into werewolves but powerless to stop it . The only way their curse can be lifted is to kill the werewolf who bit them . But who is he ? This movie has become notorious for all the production problems that plagued it . Most of the film was shot but then executives demanded changes in the script . When they were ironed out most of the cast was unavailable ( or wouldn't do it ) so the film had to be shot all over again ! To make things worse director Wes Craven was told to shot an R rated horror film . After it was finished Dimension ( who released it ) cut it down to a PG-13 . Craven has bad mouthed the film and hates it now . But it's not that bad ! The script by Kevin Williamson ( who also wrote " Scream " ) is pretty good but starts to lose focus ( and get confusing ) towards the end . Also it looks like the original ending was cut or changed . But there are some very funny lines . The movie looks great and the special effects showing the werewolves themselves are just terrific . There's also a very interesting and refreshingly positive gay subplot . Also the cuts to get a PG-13 are obvious . A lot of violence was trimmed and it's really annoying to see people on screen react to something . . . and we don't see it ! Dimension obviously cut this to make more money . Really very sad . The acting varies . Ricci is great but given little to do . Eisenberg is whiny and annoying . Shannon Elizabeth shines in her few scenes . Joshua Jackson is REALLY bad ( no surprise there ) . And drop dead gorgeous Milo Ventimiglia is very good . So it's no classic but not all that bad . I was entertained and the werewolf sequences had me grinning ( out of enjoyment ) . Hopefully we'll see the R rated cut one day . I give it an 8 .
Good . . . for laughs	Count Dracula ( Udo Kier ) can only drink the blood of virgins or he becomes violently ill . He comes upon a family with a bunch of virgin daughters . He plans to have each of them but the family's horny gardener ( Joe Dellesandro ) is after them too . . . for sex ! Silly but you just can't stop watching . Like it's companion piece ( " Andy Warhol's Frankenstein " ) the story is silly with over the top acting and gore . Kiers convulsions after drinking the blood of non-virgins is SO disgusting they're hilarious . And ( in the X rated version ) there are some fairly explicit sex scenes between Dellesandro and the daughters . And Dracula's death at the end is just great ! Silly and stupid but very funny . Try to catch the X rated version .
Disturbing and depressing but fascinating	Cliff ( Andre Noble ) has just turned 18 and is a virgin . . . and is gay . He sneaks into the city to meet a guy . He runs into hot hustler Butch ( Brendan Fehr ) and ( understandably ) falls in love . Butch seems to fall for Cliff also . . . but Butch is getting addicted to drugs and threatens to bring Cliff down with him . This is definitely not for everybody . It's fairly graphic - - there's full frontal male nudity ( not on Fehr or Noble though ) , drug abuse , plenty of sexual talk and has simulated sex acts performed with gusto . It's also one of the most depressing films I have ever seen . Still I couldn't stop watching . Basically it's a coming of age story about Cliff . . . but I found him incredibly annoying . I realize actor Noble died at a far too young age , but frankly I found his acting here fairly dreadful . His attraction to Fehr comes through but most of the time I couldn't figure out WHAT he was thinking . . . or playing . Also he looks just horrible through most of the film . On the other hand Fehr is excellent . This must have been a difficult role but he pulls it off brilliantly . He shows all sides of his character Butch . He's sometimes funny , sometimes cruel and , at the end , heartbreaking . Fehr has to pull off some explicit sexual scenes and does it wonderfully . He's also very handsome and has a great body . For those who care he does show his butt briefly . I found the character of Butch so much more interesting than the increasingly annoying Cliff . The film is shot on video leading to a pretty grimy picture . The color is faded , some of the camera work is shaky and things aren't exactly crystal clear . The sound sometimes fades in and out too . Still this is a fascinating if disturbing movie . See it for Fehr . I give it an 8 .
Terrible but LOTS of fun ! ! ! ! !	An asteroid is on a collusion course for Earth . They only have 10 hours before it hits . Wouldn't they see it LONG before that ? They send Jack Rankin ( Robert Horton ) to space station Gamma 3 ( where's 1 and 2 ? ) to get a crew to blow it out of the sky . Gamma 3 is run by ex friend Vince ( Richard Jaeckel ) . Also there is his ( sigh ) ex-girlfriend Lisa ( Luciana Paluzzi ) who's set to marry Vince ! Gotta give them credit for getting every cliché in the book rammed into this movie . They do blow the asteroid to pieces . . . but this green slime gets on the space station . It feeds on energy and can multiply QUICKLY . Soon the whole space station is battling for their lives . Sounds fun and it is . . . but in a campy way . First off there's a title song ( ! ! ! ) which is actually not bad . Then there's the wooden acting by the entire cast ( no shock there ) . There's the truly astonishing special effects - - obvious miniatures stand in for most of the buildings and you gotta love the clearly visible wires that show the astronauts " floating " through space ! As for the monsters . . . oh dear . They are easily the stupidest things I've ever seen . I literally broke out laughing when you first see one ! They are cone-shaped with one red eye ( ? ? ? ) and tentacles that go waving . Seeing them lumber around is pretty funny . I saw a full frame version on TCM ( despite the fact that it's an MGM film ) so some scenes came off looking strange but I loved this . It moves quickly , there's almost nonstop action and the " special " effects and silly monsters keep you laughing ! Also I swear that the actors were dubbed - - but Horton and Jaeckel were American ! A truly fascinating film .
Almost as good as Part 1	Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire introduce more wonderful numbers from MGM musicals . This time drama and comedy clips have been added . OK - - there was no way this could be as good as Part 1 . Most of the good material had been used there already . Also Astaire and Kelly were given some dreadful new lyrics to classic songs to sing and their introductions to segments were just terrible . It was NOT a good idea to have them dancing either . And I could have lived without the travelogue of Paris . Still , there's plenty of incredible material here . Among the highlights : Wonderful opening credits ( done by Saul Bass ) ; Eleanor Powell tap-dancing ; Greta Grabo dancing ( ! ! ) ; Robert Taylor singing ( ! ! ! ) ; the Marx Brothers stateroom sequence from " A Night at the Opera " ( unfortunately edited ) ; From This Moments On from " Kiss Me Kate " ; early Bing Crosby ; Abbott & Costello ; Tales from the Vienna Woods ( which is actually pretty funny ) ; Judy Garland singing " Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas " ; clips of dramatic and comedic stars ; the I'll Build A Stairway to Paradise number ; Bobby Van from " Small Town Girl " ; etc etc . The clips are put together without rhyme or reason - - but that helps . You never know what's coming next . Worth catching but try to see the first one too .
Very funny AND gay positive	Former Republican president Russell Kramer ( Jack Lemmon ) and former Democratic president Matt Douglas ( James Garner ) hate each other with a passion . Kramer is set up by the acting president William Haney ( Dan Aykroyd ) for taking a kickback in money that his head of state actually did . Douglas tries to help Kramer but they're soon running for their lives as the CIA sets out to kill them . And it's a comedy . Very funny movie . Garner and Lemmon play off each other well and their verbal sparrings are highlights of the movie . Their are jabs given at Dems and Reps ( although the Reps get bashed more ) . There's also an incredible supporting cast including Bradley Whitford ( years before " The West Wing " ) ; John Heard as an idiotic vice president ( an obvious parody of Dan Quayle ) ; Esther Rolle as a White House cook and Lauren Bacall ( shamefully underused ) as Lemmon's wife . Aykroyd surprisingly underplays his role as the President . Also this film is extremely gay positive which gives it extra points in my book . DEFINITE SPOILERS The presidents are able to hide from the CIA in a Gay Pride parade ; Dykes on Bikes ( an actual group ) get them to a library they need to use and a gay man ( winningly played by Jeff Yagher ) saves their lives at the end . END SPOILERS Funny , fast-paced , dramatic , gay positive . . . all in all a very good film . This bombed at the box office but it's well worth catching . I give it an 8 .
Very good but not Scorseses ' best	Film takes place in Boston . It deals with two men ( Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon ) who are both working to bring down a crime lord ( Jack Nicholson ) . Problem is they're both working for different agencies and neither knows about the other . Things quickly go out of control . OK - - this is not Martin Scorsese's best film . That goes to " Raging Bull " and " Good Fellas " . However it is one of his best . The plot has many twists and turns and surprises I didn't see coming . There's excellent use of music throughout and Scorsese really manages to capture the mood and feeling of Boston ( not easy to do ) . Also - - since this is a Scorsese film - - the word " f " is used a few hundred times and the violence is VERY extreme and bloody . This isn't for weak stomaches . My only complaints here are that the movie is too long - - it has one climax too many and some lousy acting lessens it . DiCaprio is excellent in his role . I was very impressed - - I never thought much of him as an actor but now I've changed my opinion . Nicholson , Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen are good too . Vera Farmiga holds her own in a male dominated cast . But Matt Damon is a blank in one of the main roles . His face never changes expression and I didn't know how to take him . Mark Wahlberg is bad too . How he got an Academy Award nomination for this I'll never know . He's as blank as Damon and just swears non stop for no reason and keeps giving obscene finger gestures . I was just hoping somebody would kill him off soon . He wasn't playing a character - - he was doing a caricature . Those two bad performances lessen this . Also some of the cast fake Boston accents pretty well ( Damon and Wahlberg are from the area so they didn't have to fake it ) . It got Best Picture and Best Director Academy Awards because Martin Scorsese was long overdue for both . So - - it is worth seeing but not Scorsese's best by a long shot . I give it an 8 .
Overdone but good	Highly fictionalized account of the rise of famous 1940-1950s stripper Gypsy Rose Lee . It concentrates on her domineering mother Rose ( Rosalind Russell ) and how she pushed both of her daughters into show business . One daughter ( played at various stages by both Ann Jillian and Morgan Brittany ! ) runs off so Rose concentrates on Louise ( Natalie Wood ) who becomes a world famous stripper . It's loud , overblown , too long and really takes liberties with Gypsy's real life but I was entertained . I didn't believe it for one second but the songs were great ( especially " Everything's Comin Up Roses " ) , the production numbers are certainly colorful and all the dancing is good ( I was surprised to see Wood doing a good job at one point ) . The singing is mostly good - - except for Russell . Russell herself said she couldn't sing so they mixed her voice with the voice of another singer . It certainly SOUNDS like Russell but it's off tune a few times . By all rights Ethel Merman should have been cast but she wasn't considered a box office draw in 1962 . Everybody else sings great though . There's also a show-stopping dance number by young Paul Wallace ( he plays Tulsa ) halfway through . I do wonder why he never hit it big . The acting is pretty good . Russell is just fantastic . She takes the role and runs with it . It's a crime that she wasn't even nominated for an Academy Award for this . Karl Malden is also excellent as a man who loves Rose . Surprisingly Wood is bad - - very quiet and subdued . Her character is supposed to be shy and quiet for most of the picture but she doesn't come to life even at the end when she's a famous stripper . Supposedly the real Gypsy Rose Lee showed Wood how to move on stage but it looks like Wood is hating every moment of it . But , this is Russell's show all the way and she bulldozes her way through it . It's worth seeing just for her . I give it an 8 . Look for Jack Benny in a short uncredited appearance .
Goldie tries a thriller	Dark , somber thriller about an art restorer Adrienne ( Goldie Hawn ) meeting Jack Saunders ( John Heard ) and falling in love . They marry , have a kid and are happy - - until 6 years ( or so ) into the marriage he's suddenly killed . Slowly Adrienne discovers her husband wasn't who she thought he was . . . Sort of a film noir . Hawn decided to take a chance on a dramatic role . Unfortunately this film fizzled at the box office and Hawn herself later said she made a mistake . I actually like the film . I liked it in 1991 and I still like it now 15 years later . It's got an intricate plot and some very nice directorial touches ( some of the scenes were beautiful ) . Love their apartment too . There was also a very unusual but effective music score and a few nice jolts in the movie too . The acting varies . Heard is VERY good is his role . Unfortunately Hawn isn't in hers . She's somber , quiet and too restrained . She seems very uncomfortable in the role . She doesn't ruin the movie but she lessens the impact - - maybe it's a good thing that she never tried this again . Also I noticed quite a few plot loopholes left dangling after the movie was over . Still I found this engrossing and well-made . Worth catching . I give it an 8 .
Just adorable	Two children wait up Christmas Eve to meet Santa . They do and quiz him on where he lives , what he does when it's not Christmas , etc etc . Santa answers all their questions and we see his answers . Some scenes were actually shot in Northern Alaska ( the North Pole ) . Those scenes are just beautiful and there are trips to Santa's workshop and how he finds out if children are naughty or nice . A fun little holiday film - - perfect viewing for the whole family . Adults will enjoy it as well as kids . Recommended .
Surprisingly better than the original	Sequel to " Clerks " . Dante ( Brian O'Halloran ) and Randal ( Jeff Anderson ) have lost their jobs at Quik Stop when it burnt down . hey're now working at a fast food place called Mooby's . They have a sexy manager ( Rosario Dawson ) and the seriously deranged Elias ( Trevor Fehrman ) working there too . Dante has met the girl of his dreams . He's moving to Florida to be with her . . . and work in her dad's car wash . But is that what he really wants ? OK - - I did like " Clerks " ( I gave that an 8 ) but the whiny characters and grimy photography got on my nerves . This one was shot in color ( and some black and white ) , has a budget , is better written and is much funnier than the original . Jay ( Jason Mewes ) and Silent Bob ( writer / director Kevin Smith ) are back and there are plenty of cameos from actors of other Smith films ( the two I got right off were Ben Affleck and Jason Lee ) . Also the language is STRONG - - plenty of frank sexual talk and swearing ( but then most of Smith's films are like that ) . This one has stronger characters and is absolutely hilarious . Some of the lines are just hysterical . My favorites were the Star Wars / Lord of the Rings battle and the " ABC " number . Also the acting was good . O'Halloran is great in this one - - his verbal battles with Anderson were on target . Fehrman has the unenviable nerd boy role but he pulls it off . Dawson manages to turn in a very nice sweet performance despite all the craziness around her . Also the film turns serious at the end but DOESN'T fall apart ! So I did like it a lot . Not for everybody - - the extreme language will offend some and there's a donkey sex act that pushes the boundaries of good taste . Still I loved it . A 9 .
A little bit too long but worth seeing	Movie about class distinction in 1910 England . Fairly poor Margaret Schlegel ( Emma Thompson ) befriends elderly Ruth Wilcox ( Vanessa Redgrave ) who leaves her Howard's End , a country estate . The Wilcoxes ' ignore the request and Shlegel never knows about it . . . but Mr . Wilcox ( Anthony Hopkins ) falls in love with her . It's hard to really summarize the story - - so much happens . Let's get the negatives out of the way first - - this is far too long ( 140 minutes ) and there were parts where I was getting bored ; there are lots of unexplained bits and pieces ( especially towards the end ) and I never understood WHY Hopkins wanted to marry Thompson . It seems there's a ulterior motive we're not made aware of . Still this is well worth catching . It's beautifully filmed - - there is some truly stunning set decorations here - - it was a deserved Oscar winner for Best Set and Art Direction . Also it has an intelligent , literate script which also won Best Screenplay . Thompson won Best Actress too . Actually ALL the acting here is great - - Thompson is easily the best but Helena Bonham Carter matches her as her fiery sister and Redgrave gives in a very delicate , mesmerizing performance . Hopkins is also great especially when you see the evil hiding behind his outwardly gentle facade . Great acting , beautiful sets , intelligent script - - what more could you ask for ? Try to see it in a theatre - - TV doesn't really do this one justice . I give it a 9
Just great . . . and still topical	Barbra Stanwyck plays a phony evangelist named Florence ' Faith ' Fallon . She's sick of preaching the Gospel and " curing " supposedly ill people ( they're workers for her ) , but her unscrupulous boss ( Sam Hardy ) convinces her to keep on doing it . Then she meets a kind , blind man ( David Manners ) and falls in love . He loves her too and wants to be with her . But her manager won't let her go . . . . Still strong drama was ( surprisingly ) a bomb in its day . It's now considered one of the best movies of the 1930s . Stanwyck is just superb - - you feel her pain over lying to people for money and her love for Manners . Even Manners ( usually pretty bad ) is very good . He's tall , very handsome and totally believable . You're really rooting for him and Stanwyck . Sadly , this film is still very up to the minute . There are plenty of fake evangelists still at work taking money from good , religious people . It's kind of sad that a movie over 70 years old still mirrors problems that we have today . Well worth seeing - - maybe Manners best performance .
Almost classic comedy	Basis for the very long-running TV series " MASH " . It's an absurdest , surrealistic view of a MASH ( Mobile Army Surgical Hospital ) stationed in Korea . It primarily involves the antics of three surgeons in the unit played by Donald Sutherland , Elliott Gould and Tom Skeritt . It's a very episodic film that shows that people in order are complete idiots and everyone working for them knows it . This was made in 1970 and making fun of authority figures was very popular then . This film is easily one of Robert Altman's best . It moves quickly ( the 2 hours speed by ) , has a GREAT cast and has his trademark overlapping dialogue - - yet you hear exactly what you're supposed to ( somehow ) . It seems strange but this movie has you laughing while showing you graphic operating room sequences ( which are cut down in the PG version ) . The antics of these guys are very immature and childish - - but that's how these guys keep their sanity . Despite myself I was laughing . A highlight was when one man intends to commit suicide - - take a look at the " Last Supper " he has . I don't totally like this movie because Altman's sexism comes roaring through twice . The character of Major " Hot Lips " Houlihan ( Sally Kellerman ) is treated horribly . While she is having sex at one point the guys slip a mike under her bed and broadcast it to the whole camp . That's not funny . Even worse is when they rig the shower curtain to fly up while she's in it - - it publicly , humiliatingly exposes her . Seeing her crying and screaming while trying to crawl away nude is not funny just sick . I've seen this multiple times in movie houses and no one has ever laughed at either scene . They're just too cruel and Altman seems to enjoy it . Kellerman deserves credit for maintaining her dignity despite these sequences . Because of those scenes I can only give this a 9 . Still , this is mostly a great comedy . Much better than the later TV show .
The first was the best	Rocky Balboa ( Sylvester Stallone ) , a second-rate boxer in Philadelphia , gets a match with the world champion Apollo Creed ( Carl Weathers ) . Also he falls in love with mousy Adrienne ( Talia Shire ) who blossoms with his love . He's trained by a tough-as-nails ( but loving ) trainer ( Burgess Meredith ) . This is the type of story that was being laughed off screens in the 1940s . . . but it works beautifully here . The characters are believable , flawed human beings ; the script is just great ( written by Stallone before he became full of himself ) and ( surprisingly ) all the acting is good ( Meredith and Shire take top honors ) . The theme music is rousing and the climatic fight is just fantastic . It's predictable as they come , but it's all so well-done you won't care . A HUGE hit in 1976 . As much as I like this I still can't believe it won the Best Picture Oscar back in 1977 . Still , don't miss it ! As for the sequels , Rocky 2 wasn't bad but 3 , 4 and 5 were horrendous .
Violent and exciting	Detective Mike Hammer ( Ralph Meeker ) comes upon a woman running down the road late one night with only a trenchcoat on ( Cloris Leachman in her first role ) . He picks her up - - but the car is stopped , he's knocked cold and she's tortured to death . He comes to and tries to find out who she was and why she was killed . Definitely ahead of its time - - this is a quick , tough and very violent movie . Right away from the inventive opening credits you know you're seeing something different . Meeker's Hammer is a totally amoral man - - he investigates the murder of the woman only because he figures there's something in it for him . That's pretty common today - - but not in 1955 . The violence in this film was also VERY strong for its day . There isn't a lot of it - - but what's in there is pretty graphic . The picture is full of tough dialogue and director Robert Aldrich cleverly uses tilted camera angles and very inventive use of darkness and shadows in certain scenes . The film also has two endings - - the one most commonly shown is the TV version - - the original was a few seconds shorter - - but changes things considerably . The acting is pretty good - - Meeker is just great . A violent , strong movie . I'm only giving it a 9 because Gaby Rodgers gives a terrible performance in a crucial role . Her aside though this is great . Recommended .
Very grim and disturbing but you can't stop watching	Detective Lt . William Somerset ( Morgan Freeman ) is about to retire . He is teamed up with a young new detective David Mills ( Brad Pitt ) . Together they try to find a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his M . O . Meanwhile Mills ' wife Tracy ( Gwyneth Paltrow ) fears for her husband's life and is very depressed . Dark and depressing but just fascinating . Director David Fincher shots the entire film in dim light and shoves the victims mutilated bodies in our face . The grimness of the tone wears you down but that's appropriate considering the subject matter . No humor either . It all leads to a truly harrowing ending . There was supposed to be a happy ending but they ( wisely ) chose not to do it . Freeman and Pitt work very well together and both give excellent performances . I even thought Paltrow ( who I hate ) was good ! Kevin Spacey is very good too in a small role . If you have trouble with blood , gore and disturbing subject matter stay far away from this movie . But if you can handle that , watch this one . It's depressing and unpleasant but riveting .
Almodovar at full throttle	Funny , outrageous , ridiculous , colorful and fascinating film by Almodovar - - his most popular film in America ( so far ) . The story defies description but , basically , it's about three women ( an actress , a psychopath and one on the run from the law ) who are all affected by one man . THe story starts slow , picks up speed and is barreling out of control by the end . Well-acted , beautiful to look at and never a dull moment . Just see it ! You won't be disappointed . Love the cabdriver and his cab !
80s cult film	The plot is impossible to describe but , basically , it's about a 20 something named Otto ( Estevez ) who works as a repo man . That's about it . . . the movie chronicles all his bizarre adventures and strange people he meets . I saw this when I was in college in 1984 - - it totally blew me away . I went back to see it 4 more times ! It had a huge following on college campuses back then . Sadly , it seems to have disappeared . That's a shame because I think this is perfect for high school , college kids and people with open minds . It is a true cult film . There are many great lines - - too many to get in one viewing - - this film demands multiple viewings . The actors deal well with the offbeat dialogue and situations - - especially Estevez and Stanton . As for what it means - - - who cares ? Every time I saw it I saw something different in it . A classic . Do not miss !
A gore classic	A bunch of college kids take a weekend trip to a remote cabin in the woods . They unwittingly resurrect the evil dead - - spirits who can possess them and have them kill each other off . The only way to get rid of them ? Bodily dismemberment . In terms of plot this is pretty lame - - there are a few lapses in logic that are annoying . Characterizations are nonexistent and the acting is bad ( even Bruce Campbell ! ) . But the film moves like lightning with some very imaginative direction by Sam Raimi . And when the evil dead attack after the first half hour , the movie goes barreling out of control . Tons of gore , blood and violence are thrown in your face with great sound effects and some truly gruesome makeup . Also it's kind of funny - - notice how many times Campbell is covered with blood but his face is clean and his clothes dry in the very next shot ! This was made back in 1981 on next to no budget by a bunch of college students . It's incredible what they achieved with so little to work with . Also there are two or three incredible tracking shots that I can't get enough of ! This was dismissed by horrified film critics back then ( I remember one reviewer was so disgusted he requested that every single print should be burnt ! ) , but it slowly grew into quite a hit . It's now considered a modern day classic . And Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell jump started their careers with this . So ignore the plot and concentrate on the imaginative direction , gore , special effects and sound . For horror movie fans this is a must . WARNING : There is a very tasteless sequence in which a woman is raped by a tree !
Has its moments	Back in the early 1980s a station in NJ used to show ( almost ) uncut horror films from the early 1970s at about 1 am . That's how I first saw " Blacula " , " The Night Digger " , " Don't Look in the Basement " . . . and this one . Creepy film about Gloria just being released from a mental institution . She goes home and various things start the happen that make her question her sanity - - she keeps having dreams about a cloaked figure with an ax and keeps hearing music when no one else hears anything . SPOILER - - Turns out it's just a plot to drive her crazy ( again ) to get all her money . END SPOILERIt's VERY low budget ( some of the dialogue couldn't be heard and the low production values show ) , the acting is not that great ( except for the woman playing Gloria ) and I saw it on TV so it looks like a crucial moment was cut out . Still this film had plenty of creepy images ( the cloaked man especially ) and there's one genuinely scary sequence in which she's ( sort of ) attacked by a man with an ax . Those images really worked on me - - but I WAS watching it a 1 am in the morning ! I saw this over 20 years ago and I still remember it . This will probably never be on DVD or TV soon so , if you get a chance , see it . Nothing great but it does work on you .
Just great teen update of " Taming of the Shrew "	At Pardu High School young perky sophomore Bianca Stratford ( Larisa Oleynik ) wants to date - - but her overprotective father ( Larry Miller ) won't let her until her older sister Katerina ( Julia Stiles ) dates . Problem is Katerina hates everybody ! Cameron James ( Joseph Gordon-Levitt ) wants to date Bianca and hires tough boy Patrick Verona ( Heath Ledger ) to date Katerina . Trouble is Patrick falls for Katerina . . . I can't believe I'm giving a 10 to a teen comedy ( I'm in my 40s ! ) but I loved this ! It's bright , full of color , quick with many interesting characters and some absolutely hysterical one liners . I laughed out loud more than once ! The script is sharp and just great - - it updates Shakespeare's play in a very affectionate manner . The acting is just perfect . Stiles has already proved she's a good actress - - she plays the comedy and drama to perfection . Oleynik is perfect as her younger sister - - she could have been too perky but she wasn't . Gordon-Levitt is touching in his role . Allison Janney has a few hysterical bits as guidance counselor Ms . Perky and Andrew Keegan plays the drop dead handsome but obnoxious jerk Joey Donner very well - - his verbal fights with Stiles really work ! Ledger is just OK . There's also a great soundtrack and some truly funny outtakes during the closing credits along with the band Letters from Cleo belting out a song on top of the school ! The only negative I have is that there was a bit too much swearing and sexual innuendo for a PG-13 movie . Still , I loved this movie from beginning to end - - funny and moving . Highly recommended !
Fascinating if unsettling	Absorbing profile of Robert Crumb , an underground cartoonist . Shows him at work and interacting with his friends and heavily dysfunctional family . I had no idea who Robert Crumb was ( all I knew was that he created " Fritz the Cat " ) and I find underground comics repulsive but I was never bored or repelled by this movie . It has him talking about his life and his work along with interviews with his family and friends also discussing him and his work . The film shows many of Crumb's graphic work ( VERY graphic for an R rated movie ) and has him discussing , analyzing and ( at times ) defending his work . We also see oppossing or agreement from other art critics or artists . What's most interesting is that we see he came from a very destructive family and puts all of his hatred and childhood misery into his drawings . I still don't like underground comics , but this movie helped me understand them . . . to a degree . Also a haunting look at a disturbed family . . . but it's treated sort of lightly . . . not dark and heavy . Very interesting and well done . Not for everyone but great for those with VERY open minds .
One of DePalma's best	High school misfit Carrie ( Sissy Spacek ) unleashes her telekinetic fury on her tormentors . This was a huge hit in 1976 and scared me silly . It doesn't scare me now ( except for the closing sequence ) , but I still think it's a good solid horror film beautifully handled by Brian De Palma . It moves quickly , has some beautiful imagery ( everything is shot soft focus with muted color ) and has almost uniformally good performances . The only bad one is by John Travolta way out of his depth playing a hood . Amy Irving ( as a student who befriends Carrie ) , William Katt ( with a very 70s afro ) , Nancy Allen ( playing a real bitch ) , Betty Buckley ( so young and full of energy ) and P . J . Soles ( silly but bearable ) are all perfect . But Spacek is superb matched by Piper Laurie who is very scary and marvelous as her deranged , religious mother . They were both nominated for Best Supporting Actresses Awards ( very unusual for a horror film ) . Also the film is ( by today's standards ) very restrained in terms of blood and gore . And the final sequence will make you jump ( also notice the cars in the background during that - - they're moving backwards ! ) Only complaints - - De Palma REALLY hates some of the high school kids - - you feel like like he's working out some personal issues here . And did we really need the slow-mo shower sequence at the beginning ? That aside - - this is a great film . See it letter boxed .
Excellent mystery	Government worker Luke Patterson ( Bradley Cooper ) goes to a small Native American reservation to find out about a mild earthquake there . He becomes friends with the Indian Chief of Police ( Adam Beach ) and finds an abandoned school building where the earthquake took place . It seems some very mysterious and horrifying events took place there years ago - - but the church and some local officials are covering it up . But things are starting to happen and the building may be haunted by creepy dead children . DEFINITE SPOILERS ! This is based on true events . It seems up until the early 70s , Indian children were taken from their parents and forced to attend a Catholic school . There they were told to speak English only and worship God . If they disobeyed they were punished severely . This works into the story and it's downright horrifying . I knew nothing about this and , it seems , it's STILL not talked about . Filmmaker Georgina Lightning was very brave to get funding for this and get it released . " " END SPOILERSTotally engrossing . I was never bored for one minute . I saw it at a film festival and the audience got so caught up in it they were actually gasping and saying " no " when the villain went after the good guys . Cooper's ( who's excellent ) story gets sidetracked completely after the first 30 minutes . Then it throws you head first into a story involving murders , ghosts , child abuse ( VERY disturbing ) , murder , visions , electro shock treatments - - this movie doesn't hold back . It is difficult to watch but I couldn't take my eyes off the screen . Disturbing and difficult but always fascinating . A 10 all the way .
Classic - - a prison drama written by a woman !	This is the prison drama that set the pattern for all later ones . Robert Montgomery is sent to prison and encounters hard-bitten Wallace Berry and regular guy Chester Morris . He's a nice guy but prison life slowly begins to change him . That's about all I'm going to say about the movie . . . it's well worth anybody's time to see it ( it's only 86 minutes long ) . It does lack the hard edge you might expect - - the dialogue is tame ( of course ) and there's next to no violence , but the script is excellent ( surprisingly written by a woman and a Oscar Winner ) and the acting is just great - - especially Berry ( he was nominated for an Oscar but didn't win ) . It does have a sentimental , happy ending but it WAS made in 1930 . Well worth catching - - TCM has an excellent print and shows it every once in a while . Also it's fun to see Robert Montgomery so young and handsome . Best exchange : " Who me ? " " Yes you . "
Truly one of a kind	Retired gangster Tony ( Jackie Gleason ) who's married to Flo ( Carol Channing ! ! ) is brought out of retirement by God ( Groucho Marx - - yes THAT Groucho Marx ) to rub out Packard ( Mickey Rooney ) . Problem is Packard is in prison . They're going to sneak Tony in so he can do the job . The plot is pretty straightforward but this movie gives some characters astonishing names , throws in VERY 60s designs and clothes , tons of unfunny lines and plot twists to show how " with it " the directors and such were . This was made when old Hollywood was at a loss at what attracted teenagers to movies like " Easy Rider " . So they got all these old directors and actors and wrote scripts that were totally abysmal and made zero sense ( old Hollywood thought " Easy Rider " was pointless - - it isn't ) . This is one of those movies . What's wrong with it ? Where to start ? It's impossible to list everything that happens in this train wreck ( worse than Britney Spears ) but here are a few high and low lights : Carol Channing trying to seduce Frankie Avalon ; God trying to seduce young teenage Darlene ; tons of dated dialogue showing how peaceful and loving hippies are ( sigh ) ; John Phillip Law playing a hippie named Stash - - he deserves credit for keeping a straight face while giving out the most nonsensical dialogue ever heard in a movie ; the great George Raft reduced to playing a skipper on a boat ; Gleason having an LSD trip which is a true jaw dropper ; Richard Kiel as a prison guard ; Law giving a code message over the phone ( OK - - THAT scene is great ! ) ; an entire prison spaced out on LSD ; Burgess Meredith as a warden ; Peter Lawford as a senator ( figures - - he was married to a Kennedy ) and a Garbage Pail number which will have you questioning your sanity . There's more but those hit me . The acting - - well who can tell ? The movie is all over the place . Still Gleason is actually pretty good and Channing chews the scenery . Marx ( in his last theatrical role ) was , sadly , pretty terrible as God . He doesn't even get any jokes to crack ! The movie goes barreling over the edge at the end with Channing singing the title song ( which is admittedly pretty catchy ) and ALL the closing credits are sung ! This is a one of a kind motion picture . Yeah it's terrible - - a bunch of older actors / producers / directors trying ( in vain ) to prove how " hip " they are . Still , you can't stop watching and I was never bored for one minute . I just sat there in amazement watching the movie unfold . Truly a camp classic and a 10 all the way ! This NEEDS a DVD transfer ! Paramount is probably ashamed of it - - they let TCM show it but they gave them a full frame print and it played early in the morning . Look - - if we can get jaw-droppers like the 1980 musical " The Apple " out there we can get this ! See it if you get the chance . Trust me - - you'll be amazed !
