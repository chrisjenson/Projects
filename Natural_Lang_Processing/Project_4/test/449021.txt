Pay to get in ; pray to get out .	A below-zero-budget horror film about a group of students that decide to open their own haunted house on Halloween . A strange man named Hal comes to check the city codes trying to shut the house down ; but fails . The nine room haunted house opens for business , but soon the house takes on something evil that has the students using various props as torture devices . Things really get chaotic when Hal returns as a psycho clown ( director Eric Worthington ) with an iron hand . Bodies begin to pile up . For sure evil forces have made the haunted house a house of death . The lists of players include : Miki Welling , Lynnie Horrigan , Michael Murdock and Larry Crist . Musical score by Jahn Breeze . I doubt if a cold six-pack could help this clunker .
Self-serving step-brother of Elvis steps into the spotlight .	Based on a true story . What exactly was David Stanley taking this time ? Everyone has an opinion ; Stanley writes , directs and produces this proverbial t # ^ d in a punch bowl . Why would Elvis put his life in the hands of a teenage hanger on ? If Mr . Stanley wants us to put credence in his self-serving story , why would he change the names , dates and situations ? It doesn't take long to realize that this is another attempt at bleeding money from Elvis ' legacy . In any respectable book about Elvis , you'll find Stanley a mere " gopher " . Tom Sizemore representing a character based on Joe Esposito is an embarrassment . Dee Stanley Presley should feel honored being played by someone with the looks of Dey Young . And the only thing I can say about Peter Dobson playing " The King " ; he did better than Don Johnson and Dale Midkiff . After saying all this ; kudos to Matt Barr , who actually is the best actor in this film . This really is not a movie about Elvis ; its about David Stanley and his self conception .
The Doctor has a strange secret .	Bela Lugosi is a mad scientist that comes up with a secret serum that turns him into a very agitated ape . In order to walk more erect and regain his human side . . . he needs to ' collect ' human spinal fluid . This is so lame it is a hoot . Lugosi fans must even shake their heads in wonderment . It is a fun time watch though ; catch it when you can . Also in the cast are : Wallace Ford , Louise Currie , Emil Van Horn and Henry Hall . Not to be confused with first class horror .
Scraping the bottom .	A very weak and way below any kind of budget . Drive-in movie fare . While drive-in moviegoers are hugging , smooching and backseat bouncing , a lunatic is randomly picking victims to slash , dismember and kill . The drive-in is built on the former grounds of a circus and is being managed by former circus knife handler ( Newton Naushaus ) and his grounds keeper is the former sword swollower ( Douglas Gudbye ) . Two dim-witted detectives ( Jake Barnes and Adam Lawrence ) are assigned to investigate and realize the weapon of choice seems to be an antique sword . Hard to find anything redeemable . Nothing frightening or scary . Some of the situations end up being comical . Also listed as players : Verkina Flowers , Marty Gatsby , Patrica James and Norman Sherlock .
Haunting tale of revenge .	From the works of Edgar Allen Poe , a tale of African tribal rites , premature burial , vengeance , grave robbing and murder . An English aristocrat ( Vincent Price ) tries to hide his disfigured brother ( Alister Williamson ) , who escapes and blackmails a doctor ( Christopher Lee ) in hiding him and allowing him to seek revenge and commit murder before being killed . Very tangled story line and not enough terror to make it to a favorites list . Horror masters Price and Lee share no scenes and neither seems to be in top form . The crimson hooded Williamson actually appears to be the lead character . Just enough female persuasion from Sally Geeson , Uta Levka and Hilary Dwyer .
Blackmail can be fun .	An estranged son ( Macaulay Culkin ) tries to blackmail his ex-con father ( Ted Danson ) into spending time with him . Danson and two cronies pull of a rare coin heist and then Culkin arrives wanting to share father and son time . The coins are used to blackmail the ponytailed Danson into pleasing the obnoxious Culkin . HOME ALONE ( 1990 ) and MY GIRL ( 1991 ) were at least worth watching . This is neither funny or interesting . Danson fares well in his arrogant way . Gleene Headly is not believable as a detective . Also in the cast are : Gailard Sartain , Saul Rubinek and Hector Elizondo . Geared for the grammar school set .
The worm turns and rises .	I thought I would be watching a pretty decent B-movie and I was quickly mistaken . Special effects are mainly close-ups of your every day earth worm . The long shots give the worms the appearance of two foot long crimson spaghetti . Just like coming upon a bad car crash . . . it is so ugly you can't turn your head . The acting . . . not good . A small community in Georgia is terrorized by giant flesh eating earth worms after being electrocuted out of the ground . Why do I think this is something that can only take place " down south " y'all ? What is intended to be horror turns out to be somewhat humorous . But still curiosity has to be fed . . . how or will the townsfolk out smart their attackers ? Actors include : Don Scardino , Patricia Pearcy and Peter MacLean . A younger viewer may be more impressed .
A direct hotline to the Devil .	Gracious be , what a story . A wicked teacher ( Rene Assa ) takes advantage of powers obtained from his phone calls to Satan . Some creative murder scenes and a fun watch with a party crowd . Debbie James is nice in the looks department , but light in acting skills . Patrick O'Bryan seems miscast as the biker hero . Also in the cast is Philip McKeon .
A tough mission for a special squad of G . I . Joe's .	Edward Cahn directs this very low budget war yarn . Mike Connors leads a special squad assigned to destroy top intelligence papers in the Philippines . The mission is almost suicidal , because the Japanese have set up a HQ in the small building housing the hidden documents . Familiar stock footage is meshed with this spotty script . No masterpiece , but a quickie war flick worth watching . Diverse cast of characters that include : Bing Russell , Russ Bender and John Ashley . Ashley always seems to over act , but then there is Jewell Lain that shows very little skills as a reporter / love interest . Look for Sammee Tong , who played the butler on TV's " Bachelor Father " . Lock and load .
Sometimes you need a little help . . . sometimes a lot .	Talk about an unlikely duo . This comedy crime caper stars Queen Latifah , who plays Belle , a none too timid taxi driver on her first day with a souped-up taxicab with NASCAR on her mind . Belle by random accident finds herself helping a clumsy inept cop ( Jimmy Fallon ) , who is driving challenged and hails a cab to get to a bank robbery . To make this flick click . . . the bad guys aren't even guys . The culprits are four Brazillian supermodels led by Gisele Bundchen . Some real nifty car chases and provocative posing by the supermodels may be equally dangerous . I can't really describe what Latifah and Fallon do as acting ; but it is certain they can control a scene . Explosions , shoot-outs and some mild sexual references equal a PG-13 RATING . Very fine support is provided by Jennifer Esposito , Henry Simmons and Ann-Margret .
Rootin ' tootin ' Roy Rogers and Trigger .	The singing cowboy Roy Rogers is a Border Patrol agent delving into the disappearance of several men near the border between Mexico and San Angelo . Along with Sheriff Cookie Bullfincher ( Andy Devine ) and a sensational novelist from the East Lee Madison ( Dale Evans ) , Roy discovers that Rex Gridley ( John McGuire ) is smuggling Mexican gold across the border and hiding it in an abandoned mine . And how can Rogers do all this without a song or two and his faithful horse , Trigger . William Witney directs this 54 minute oater . Supporting cast includes : Fritz Leiber , Fred ' Snowflake ' Toones , David Sharpe and Bob Nolan and his Sons of the Pioneers . A good companion is THE GOLDEN STALLION ( 1949 ) .
Sometimes love needs a shove .	Sappy romantic comedy . Cute does not make memorable . An aspiring chef ( Freddie Prinze ) cooks up a whirlwind relationship with a wannabe artist ( Julia Stiles ) . Serious love seems to need deeper thought and a swift kick in the butt . Also in the cast are Selma Blair , Lucie Arnaz and Henry Winkler . Ashton Kutcher sucks big time as Jim Morrison . Ms . Stiles was the only reason I watched . Otherwise disappointing .
Grissly horror filmed in Blood Color .	Soooo bad ; but fun to watch . Herschell Gordon Lewis is a one man gore master . He directs , produces , creates a story line and takes charge of cinematography and special effects . He also provides the original music . A weird and deranged Egyptian caterer ( Mal Arnold ) searches for beautiful young women to mutilate and dismember in sacrifice for an Egyptian goddess . A puzzled detective ( William Kermin ) works hard to find the mysterious killer and provide safety and peace of mind for his young girlfriend ( Connie Mason ) . Some pretty gory scenes that thrilled drive-in goers in the mid 1960s . Other credited players : Scott H . Hall , Ashlyn Martin , Astrid Olson and Louise Kamp . Lewis himself is the voice of the radio announcer .
It doesn't pay to mess with Mother Nature .	Emily Rasmussen ( Jena Malone ) is a young woman that cuts her college education short due to expecting an illegitimate child . She returns to her stepfather's ( Don Harvey ) sheep ranch . Almost immediately Emily realizes that the sheep are acting out of character . . . attacking each other and some dying after cutting their throats on barb wire eating weeds from the adjoining farm . That neighbor began crowing corn when provided with a newly generated seed that was meant to be immune to all pesticides . Jenna runs up against speculation and doubt when trying to warn the towns people to avoid eating lamb her stepfather sold to local markets . Low budget and unmemorable . Others in the cast : Pamela Gray , Jamie Harold , Brian Dykstra and Peter McRobbie .
Radiation the blame for a monster thriving on sunlight .	Robert Clarke writes , directs and stars as Dr . Gilbert McKenna , a research physicist who is accidentally exposed to radiation . While being treated for the burn , it comes to light that enough sunlight will temporarily turn him into a lizard-like creature . The more sunlight the worse the condition . At night he wines , dines and enjoys life ; but during the day the doctor cowers from the sun . Not only has McKenna become a monster , but also a killer . Being shot in Black & White adds to the atmosphere . But still on close ups you can see the lizard suite's yolk flapping in the breeze . Still worth a watch . Other players : Patricia Manning , Nan Peterson , Patrick Whyte , Robert Garry and Daryl Westbrook .
Godzilla up against a very strange foe .	This movie is so weird , it is almost comical . Better known as Godzilla vs The Smog Monster , this flick tries to take on a different format that resembles a poor man's James Bond movie . Seems to be put together kind of haphazardly , but really pretty interesting . Godzilla battles Hedrah or Hedora , a creature spawned from industrial pollution and rank waste material . Probably the strangest in the Godzilla series .
Another giant insect to chill and drill you .	This movie borders being terrible . It is so close to being lame it is funny . Slimy , gory , and crude . Dialogue is about as bad as the acting . A spacecraft crashes in a swamp in a National Park and the area is invaded by mosquitoes as big as a Great Dane . Special effects vary in degrees of believability . But then again we are talking giant mosquitoes . View it as a bloody comedy and you won't be too disappointed . Two of the writers ( Gunnar Hansen and Steve Hodge ) are cast members . Also taking credit as actors are : Ron Asheton , Steve Dixon , Rachel Loiselle and John Reneaud . Very small children might actually be frightened , so don't spoil it for them by laughing out loud .
Why can't we just all get along ?	Try to fit in or decide to do the right thing ? Ambition is one of the things that stands in the way of J . J . Johnson ( Michael Boatman ) . . . the other is that he is a rookie state trooper with the LA Sheriff's Department and the first black officer at his first assigned station . Who is he teamed with ? The station's only female deputy Deb Fields ( Lori Petty ) . This movie progresses with nonstop suspense and explosive decisions to be made . Johnson and Fields uncover mass corruption when they discover that a well known criminal ( Ice Cube ) has been framed and jailed for a vicious murder . Do they break the unwritten code of silence or do the right thing ? Well . . . what makes for a better movie ? This gritty police yarn is filled with obligatory violence and an all-star cast of actors like : Richard Anderson , M . Emmet Walsh , Michael Ironside , Bernie Casey and Elliott Gould . I was really impressed with Boatman and Ice Cube . On the other hand I have never been or will be a fan of Petty . Overall the truth proves to be pretty damn powerful .
Not all things are what they appear to be . Spying is a great risk !	This is a lengthy romantic spy drama . A love story of a master spy ( Michael Douglas ) and his baby-voiced secretary ( Melanie Griffith ) . A spy story having the unskilled in spying secretary going into 1940s Germany to retrieve some valuable information about a German " flying bomb " . A very dramatic intrigue filled finale . Although I can not understand a super sleuth ( Douglas ) trying to pull off a daring rescue behind the enemy lines in Germany without being able to speak German . Also in the cast are John Gielgud , Liam Neeson and Joely Richardson . David Seltzer directs his screenplay of Susan Isaacs ' novel .
The truth is in the serum .	Very interesting Sci-Fi thriller directed by John Dahl . A forensic expert ( Ray Liotta ) accused of murdering his wife injects himself with an experimental serum that may help identify her killer . Use of flashbacks provides the " meatier " part of the movie . Some scenes are not only vivid , but stomach turning . Liotta does well with the role and leads a very solid cast featuring : Linda Fiorentino , Peter Coyote , Christopher McDonald , Kim Cattrall and Kim Coates . Fiorentino was my main interest in watching this worthwhile and a little far-fetched mystery .
One for the money ; two for the show ; 48 more boosts to go .	Very shallow script ; lame story line ; wasted star studded cast ; but enough action to keep your eyes on the screen . Lovers of fine cars will be in Heaven . Memphis Raines ( Nicolas Cage ) is a recently retired genius car thief that must come to the rescue of his little brother ( Giovanni Ribisi ) . Raines must gather a crew and boost 50 exotic cars in one night in exchange for the life of his brother . Cage can say so much with his mannerisms and expressions to make up for the script . Robert Duvall wants to take charge of the movie so bad you can see it . A blonde Angelina Jolie is sassy and sexy and that is enough . Gosh , she makes me sweat . Will Patton is like a fish out of water . Ribisi is just a little over the top , but after all his life is at stake . Not one of the best action / crime flics , but sure is fun to watch . At times , Cage and Jolie are at the flash point .
Crude visitor films documentary .	All the hype is just that . Either you will be shocked , insulted and repulsed or dumb-struck by hilarity . . . maybe just cheaply entertained by tasteless humor . Borat Sagdiyev ( Sacha Baron Cohen ) is a TV personality that is dispatched from his country Kazakhstan to visit and film a documentary on the US of A . This crude , albeit hilarious and oblivious of political correctness character criss-crosses America to interview the real people he meets in this land of so many freedoms and the body delicious Pamela Anderson . Borat is smitten by the buxom star and will stop at nothing to meet and maybe marry her . Male nudity , masturbation , pseudo-sex and lewd laden language are just a few of the R rated elements that may make you feel like an idiot for watching . I would hate to think of a sequel .
Prim is not always proper .	Get ready ; get set ; go psycho ! Patrick Bateman ( Christian Bale ) is a sharp dressed man ; a player on Wall Street no less . He has a strong opinion of the music he likes and doesn't like . He treats people about the same way . His avocation is dating women only to chop them in pieces ; or hang them in his closet to die ; and sometimes practice using his chainsaw on them . One moment egotistical businessman and the next an over the top psychotic killer . A very good visual and mental shocker . At times a little bloody and at other times a blood bath . Bateman wants to confess his evil deeds and believe it or not he has trouble convincing people he is other than Mr . Prim and Proper . Also in the cast are : Willem Dafoe , Samantha Mathis , Chloe Sevigny and not enough of Reese Witherspoon .
Do you like to watch ? Death via computer !	This piece of gore is better than the bad rap it has been given . Some scenes could be deemed repulsive . Not advised for weak stomachs . A NYPD detective ( Stephen Dorff ) gets the case of his life when mysterious deaths are linked to a website where a demented doctor ( Stephen Rea ) tortures victims to death . Forty-eight hours after logging on to the live website the viewer dies by their own worse fear . Curiosity overrides common sense . Fear can be compelling . Also in the cast are : Natacha McElhone , Amelia Curtis and Gesine Cukrowski . www . Fear . com
Its hard to find the apartment that is just right .	Yet another attempt by Hollywood to remake a Japanese horror film . An apt cast of stars in a thriller that is more suspense than scare ; and more boredom than suspense . Very slow and dark . Set in rainy Seattle and NYC . DARK WATER keeps you waiting from the get go . Dahlia ( Jennifer Connelly ) is recently separated and in a bitter custody battle with her estranged husband . She must find a new job as well as a new apartment for her and her daughter Ceci ( Areil Gade ) . Finances forces Dahlia to rent a cramped apartment in a dilapidated building filled with mystery . Strange noises and a leaking ceiling causes Dahlia's imagination to overload . The cast is fleshed out with : John C . Reilly , Camryn Manheim , Dougray Scott and an eerie Pete Postlethwaite .
Pizzia is not the only thing getting hot and sticky .	Coming of age or just hot to trot ; three young girls working at the Mystic Pizza Shop each have particular problems with the men in their lives . Julia Roberts makes her first real noticable appearance on the big screen . She is in love with a guy that may think he is too good for her . Lili Taylor uses sex as her own version of self therapy . And Annabeth Gish has the quivers for a married man with a six year old daughter . Gish does the best acting in the whole movie . I have always found her tempting and appealing . Also in the cast are Conchata Ferrell , William Moses and Vincent D'Onofrio . Note : There is a small part for Matt Damon , his first on the silver screen .
Pa Kettle , you're a grandpa .	The Kettles ( Marjorie Main and Percy Kilbride ) become grandparents when Tom ( Richard Long ) and Kim ( Meg Randall ) present them with an 8 pound baby girl . The Kettles are still living in their modern prefab home and company is a comin ' . Kim's parents ( Ray Collins and Barbara Brown ) with their blue-blooded attitudes of rearing children force Ma and Pa back to their rundown shack of a home . In the meantime , Pa using dynamite to dig a new well thinks he has discovered uranium . . . something that Kim's father knows a lot about . The Kettles are almost swindled out their long-time homestead , but Pa's war-surplus overalls saves the day . Also in the cast : Emory Parnell , Oliver Blake and Teddy Hart .
Heartbreaking to see a bad imitation of Elvis .	Don't get me wrong . I do like most of Chris Columbus ' other projects . I do like David Keith , but he gives one of the worse portrayals of Elvis I have ever seen . This time flattery is not complimentary . It bothers me to see Elvis portrayed with a chip on his shoulder and with such an angry attitude . This was meant to be a fantasy / comedy , but I feel it sure misses the mark . Outlandish story of a teenage boy gathering a few of his buddies and kidnapping Elvis after a concert in Ohio . The King of Rock ' n ' Roll is persuaded to ' hideout ' at the home of the boy as a surprise for his depressed mother , an avid Elvis fan . I thought this was a cute movie the first time I saw it . Upon viewing a couple of more times , I find it less attractive . For the pure Presley fans out there , this is like watching an outbreak of the plague . The ending tries to leave you with a peaceful and proud feeling , but the damage had already been done . One time Elvis co-star in WILD IN THE COUNTRY , Tuesday Weld plays the bewildered fanatic . Charlie Schlatter plays the wise ass kidnapper . If you are an Elvis fan and haven't already seen this ; don't waste your time .
Imagination or omen ?	Following the tragic death of their young son , Ellen ( Amanda Plummer ) and her husband Martin ( Shawn Pertwee ) search for a new life and move into an old two story house in the country . Eerie things begin happening to Ellen ; she sees cryptic visions of her own death . Keeping this to herself is torture and the warnings progressively get more threatening . The visions may actually be a binder between her own death and deep dark secrets of the old house . Time keeps ticking away and there is an urgency for if the warnings are true . . . Ellen only has a very few days to live . A chilling methodical madness . Supporting cast features : Nick Brimble , Sean Chapman , Chris Barnes and Renee Ackermann . Manifistations of grief are not often taken lightly .
The trials and tribulations of computer wizardry .	This movie has some brilliant moments . This is computer wizard heaven / hell . Some young students / hacking computer ' geeks ' stumble upon an embezzlement scheme and use their wizardry to thwart the criminal masterminds . I admit watching this for one reason . . . Angelina Jolie . Even with a ' butch ' haircut , she is one sensual goddess . Fisher Stevens is outstanding as ' The Plague ' . Jonny Lee Miller in the lead role is arrested as a child using the moniker of ' Zero Cool ' . After serving a lengthy probation period he takes up the name ' Crash Override ' and finds himself in competition with ' Acid Burn ' ( Jolie ) . This manic computer madness also features Matthew Lillard , Jesse Bradford , Peter Y . Kim and Darren Lee .
Footloose and freedom bound .	Animated enjoyment . . . definitely not the best I've seen , but crude humor gives it a little lift and a PG rating . Marty the zebra ( Chris Rock ) is bored with being in the NYC Central Park Zoo and decides to bust out and maybe find " the wild " . After Marty's escape , he is discovered missing by his friends Alex the Lion ( Ben Stiller ) , Melman the Giraffe ( David Schwimmer ) and Gloria the hopeful Hippo ( Jada Pinkett Smith ) . The three break out of the zoo and finds Marty at Grand Central Station , but before they can catch the train back home , they are darted and carted and placed on a ship headed to Africa , where they can get away from their stressful captivity . The ship is sabotaged by some persistent penguins and all find themselves stranded on the shores of Madagascar , off the southeast coast of Africa . Surprises arise and the four friends are faced with the reality of their own predestined roles in the animal world . Also lending voices to this fine looking CGI animated adventure are : Sacha Baron Cohen , Andy Richter , Chris Knights and Cedric the Entertainer . Rock's Marty the Zebra is the most likable character . I think just the opposite about Stiller's Alex the Lion . I can't say I am honestly awaiting a MADAGASCAR 2 .
An interesting look at a baseball legend .	William Bendix physically resembles the first great home run slugger of baseball , Babe Ruth . This movie do doubt is very attractive to young boys of many generations . Keep in mind this is a candy coated version of the rowdy and ribald character's life . All the myths are here , and you see how The Babe earned his adoration . Also in the movie are Claire Trevor , Charles Bickford and William Frawley .
Memories fueled by fear .	Karin ( Gina Philips ) is an advertising exec that honors her dying grandmother's wish of returning to the crumbling estate on which she was raised until she was thirteen and prepare it for sale on the real estate market . She has bad memories from her past , but reluctantly goes to the rundown estate . Thinking she is alone , she realizes there is caretaker named Pierce ( Tom Sizemore ) living on the grounds . Pierce is not just a little creepy , he is cruel and dangerous . Karin's sister Wendy ( Jenny Mollen ) arrives to help put things at ease . . . but things begin to go horrifically wrong . The caretaker becomes a sadistic madman and near impossible to appease . Miss Philips is very easy to look at ; Sizemore will make you shiver .
Lust in the dust .	Highly anticipated . Hyped to the hilt . Howard Hawks directs with the aid of Howard Hughes . This western depicts the relationships between Billy the Kid ( Jack Buetel ) , Doc Holliday ( Walter Huston ) and Sheriff Pat Garrett ( Thomas Mitchell ) . Cowboys , Indians and gun play are not the main feature . . . the debut of Jane Russell is ! This movie was filmed in 1941 , but it took two years to pass the censors due to the shameless display of Russell's ample assets ( 36D ) . Aircraft pioneer Hughes actually designed the bra that helps showcase Russell . This is also Buetel's debut ; but Huston is the one to prove his screen greatness . Probably the first sex western . Of course the fade outs leave a lot to the imagination . Worth the ballyhoo .
How a man loathes a woman .	Kind of creepy . Low budget film noir directed by Ned Hockman . Filmed mostly around Oklahoma City , Norman and Lexington Oklahoma . A black and white drama about an unemployed man Gerald Winslow ( Skip Homeier ) that physically and emotionally tortures his wife Ellen ( Beverly Garland ) . She craves her husband's love , but his sadistic pleasures forces her into the arms of a former business partner and her new boss ( Kenneth Tobey ) . Photography is grainy and some of the acting miserable . The story is interesting and well paced . Garland is perfect as the pathetic wife that just wants a little attention . She survives mental torture , rape and humiliation to find out that her husband has a fixation on his dead mother . Homeier is down right devilish and his first scene lets you know pretty much what to expect from him . The guy is a jerk , creep and sadistic low life . Also in the cast : Paul Scovil , Hannah Stone and George Clow .
Life becomes thought provoking .	Not exactly the knee slapping comedy you think , but a ' feel good ' life altering decision maker . One of Manhattan's richest and ruthless businessmen ( Nicolas Cage ) is transformed into a suburban working stiff with wife and children . Tea Leoni leads the supporting cast that features Don Cheadle , Harve Presnell , Mary Beth Hurt and Saul Rubinek .
Apache gold strikes interest .	Indians , gold-seekers and dance hall girls liven this hackneyed saga of a selfish politician trying to start an uprising in order to get to the gold on Apache land . Very good scenery and strong cast ; but the story is too predictable . The players include : Robert Young , Janis Carter , Jack Buetel and Reed Hadley .
Can ghosts make you a believer ?	This made-for-TV horror / ghost story is suspenseful , somber , sometimes slow and at times far from believability . THE HAUNTED is partially based on a book by Jack Smurl and eyewitness testimony . In the mid-1980s , a Pittston , Pennsylavania family . . . the Smurls . . . start noticing things are just not right with their home . Not really believing in spirits , Janet Smurl ( Sally Kirkland ) is forced to realize and has a hard time convincing her husband Jack ( Jeffrey DeMunn ) , until minions of Satan go to work slamming doors , smashing household items and bedeviling with imitation of family voices . Spooky and scary ? Just a bit . The cast also features : Joyce Van Patten , Diane Baker , John Mallory Asher , William O'Connnell and Louise Latham .
It glides , it slides , it crawls , it rolls like jelly .	A meteorite slams to earth . After some poking and prodding , a gooey jelly-like substance slowly begins to devour the inhabitants of a small town . A young man ( Steve McQueen ) and his girlfriend ( Aneta Corsaut ) by chance stumble upon the answer to stopping the alien lifeform . At the time of release , a very popular movie with teens . It also was a ' word of mouth ' success . Should be one of the most memorable sci-fi flicks .
Old Africa : Blood and Guts .	This documentary was three years in the making and is not for the weak of heart or stomach . You may find yourself so disgusted you'll stop watching ; or your curiosity will have your total attention to this offering from the directors of MONDO CANE . Africa in the 1960s was not only black and white , but also blood red . This film features glimpses of atrocities most only read about and things definitely hidden from tourists . There is scenes of violent unrest in the Congo ; the final days of British rule in Kenya ; the slaughter and displacement of the Watusi tribe ; the grisly look at poaching and slaughter of once protected iconic members of the African animal kingdom ; as well as executions of political rivals . You may be in the mood for a stiff drink ; I doubt you will have an appetite .
Randolph Scott starts a family feud on the border .	Randolph Scott and director Budd Boetticher team up again with this average cowboy flick about loyalty and betrayal . Loner Tom Buchanan , on his way home to west Texas , stops along the California / Mexican border and is jailed falsely accused of being the parter of a young Mexican trying to avenge the rape of his sister . Buchanan is released , but led out of town minus his money belt containing $5 , 000 . He escapes being shot in the back and returns to town to collect his stolen money . In doing so , he must start some mistrust and anger between three corrupt brothers who run the town . Buchanan ends up in the manipulation of a double-cross to keep the Mexican youth from hanging . An obvious low-budget western , but still interesting . Also in the cast of players : Craig Stevens , Manuel Rojas , Barry Kelley , Peter Whitney , L . Q . Jones , Tol Avery and Jennifer Holden . Of note : Miss Holden only appeared in three movies ; the first being her better role in the Elvis Presley classic JAILHOUSE ROCK ( 1957 ) .
A young man questions an elderly neighbor .	Brandon Boyce brings a Stephen King novella to the screen . Bryan Singer directs this moody and dark look at furthering education . A brilliant young student ( Brad Renfro ) hungers for more knowledge of the Holocaust . He cleverly discovers an elderly neighbor ( Ian McKellen ) is in fact a runaway Nazi . Blackmail and fear cause the old man to tell stories of the war crimes never printed in a school book . The war criminal succumbs to weakness and the mild mannered school boy relishes his new found power and assertiveness . This is a thriller more than a chiller . Your brain stays engaged . Don't miss this one . David Schwimmer is miss cast as a guidance counciler .
Underrated Hitchcock good vs evil .	An aircraft factory worker ( Robert Cummings ) is accused of starting a devastating fire that killed his best friend . He avoids being arrested and sets out on a cross country trip to catch the real arsonist . Norman Lloyd is part of a sabotage ring trying to interrupt normal functioning of the US Government . Priscilla Lane is a professional model that reluctantly comes to Cummings ' aid . Probably the best job of acting is that of Otto Kruger , a kingpin in the sabotage ring . The chase ending finale at the Statue of Liberty will always remain a classic cinematic moment . The second half of the movie is by all means more interesting than the first . This movie does not seem to get the recognition that it deserves . Rounding out the cast are : Alma Kruger , Alan Baxter , Murray Alper and Billy Curtis .
Haunting and scary remake !	Just like putting a shine on the perfect apple . John Moore directs this remake of the 1976 classic starring Gregory Peck and Lee Remick . Same situations with maybe more profound violence . Godson of the President and a recently appointed U . S . foreign diplomat , Robert Thorn ( Liev Schreiber ) , exchanges an orphan for his stillborn baby . Mrs . Thorn ( Julia Stiles ) gradually begins to notice things are just not right with the young Damien ( Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick ) . Things become a bit grotesque as the nanny commits suicide and is replaced with a mysterious caregiver ( Mia Farrow ) . An observant photographer ( David Thewis ) convinces Thorn that his child is the son of Satan ! My favorite scene is when Thorn meets a priest ( Pete Postlethwaite ) under a bridge in the rain . . . right before the later is impaled . Watching the photographer meet his fate is also very graphic . I wish Stiles had more screen time . This remake is really one worth watching .
Who is living with a dark past life to hide ?	Orson Welles directs this story by Victor Trivas . An escaped Nazi war criminal ( Welles ) is living in a small town where he is a respected professor at a school for boys . Part of his cover is to marry the lovely Loretta Young . Things go well until an agent searching out war criminals ( Edward G . Robinson ) comes to town . The professor's obsession with fixing the clock in an old church bell tower tends to give away his secret identity . My favorite scene is seeing the expression on the professor's face when Young enters the house after she was suppose to have been killed . Of course the dramatic finale is like poetic justice when the sinister professor meets his demise . Great camera work and scenery in this Film-Noir . Also in the cast are Richard Long and Martha Wentworth . This often over-looked film is one of Welles ' most successful .
Robbery induces the guilt factor .	Funny guy Harold Ramis produces and directs this dark comedy set on Christmas Eve . Charlie Arglist ( John Cusack ) is a mob lawyer that convinces partner-in-crime Vic ( Billy Bob Thornton ) it is time to lay low after stealing a little over two million dollars from his boss ( Randy Quaid ) . At least the ice storm must ease up enough to get the hell out of Wichita . As Charlie realizes that paranoia is about to control him , it is all he can do to not attract attention to himself . . . not so easy . On his way to see the flame in his heart Renata ( Connie Nielsen ) at a strip club , he runs into a fellow attorney ( Oliver Platt ) who is drunker-than-a-skunk and attention grabbing antics flow like watered-down drinks . There is also some humor from a local dim bulb cop ( T . J . Jagodowki ) . The comedy is dark , but funny ; and the pacing is sporadic . Cusack fans will easily be pleased . . . but the Thornton followers may grumble about so little screen time for Billy Bob .
A touching and informative biography of a true hero .	This is a powerful story of the trials and tribulations of Jim Thorpe , a hero in the true sense of the word .

Lisa Harrow is the pent-up wife of J . P . ( Bruno Ganz ) and Kerry Fox is Vicki the younger sister and temptress . I saw this on IFC and was really reeled in with the straight forward atmosphere and personal subject matter . Cinematography is super and the Australian accents cool and pleasing . This is a powerful drama ; and well deserved kudos for director Gillian Armstrong .

Also in the cast of this fun , run and gun romp are : Tim Curry , Matt LeBlanc , Kelly Lynch and a very impressive villain played by Crispin Glover . If you have yet to fall in love with Miss Diaz , you deserve no mercy . She proves again to be charming , sexy and very talented . Miss Barrymore also has that way of being funny while not losing an ounce of sex appeal . Although contrived and a bit silly this movie is an action filled escape . There is no doubt that this explosive trio of crime-fighters will be back to use their skills and complete their mission . Thank you , Angels !

After a little personality posturing , Chili discovers that loansharking is not all that different from making movies . Maybe in Hollywood you need to be more cutthroat . . . hell , Palmer can do that . This cute comic crime caper has an impressive list of co-stars : Danny DeVito , Rene Russo , James Gandolfini and Dennis Farina . DeVito has the talent of being wickedly funny . . . just change the character's name and Danny is ready to do his thing . Russo is strong when she needs to be . Farina IS Ray ' Bones ' Barboni . GET SHORTY seems a quick change of pace .
Something is just not right on this submarine .	Sci-Fi escape drama that will have you on the edge of your seat and cracking your knuckles . When a WWII submarine picks up three survivors of an incident in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean in 1943 , the crew suddenly experiences mysterious doings in the confined space .

Decent enough F / X and sometimes scary story line holds your interest .

American ballplayers are treated like rock ' n ' roll stars in Japan and Jack is no exception . The American slugger has trouble fitting into the eastern society and thanks to his interpreter ( Kosuke Toyohara ) he doesn't completely alienate himself .

Unknowingly he finds romance with the coach's daughter ( Aya Takanashi ) and that is just part of the humor found in this likable and short of heartwarming movie . Most of the humor comes from Jack's interpreter . Selleck fits the role pretty well . Ted Danson would have been another good choice for the role , but Selleck provides enough arrogance to carry it off . Not a total waste of time , but there is doubts about a double header . Twice is enough for me .
Investigative reporting gets hairy and hairier .	This puppy is the one that started a small franchise . Not saying that the sequels were any more popular or even better made . An attractive and ambitious television reporter ( Dee Wallace-Stone ) takes on an assignment at a rehab center hoping to get a quality story and ends up with actually more than she can handle . Upon investigation it is discovered the patients at the clinic are werewolves .

The intense cast directed by Joe Dante includes : Kevin McCarthy , Patrick Macnee , Slim Pickens , John Carradine , Dick Miller , Belinda Balanski and a cameo by Roger Corman .
You must know the difference between a promise and a threat .	Director Stephen Kay gets one hell of a performance out of Sly Stallone . Ranking right up there with Rocky fighting the Russian boxer . Stallone plays Jack Carter , a no nonsense enforcer for the mob in Vegas . He goes back home for his brother's funeral and suspects that the death was not accidental , but murder . Carter goes up against some tough resistance in collecting info on his brother and his death . Carter's niece ( Rachel Leigh Cook ) slowly warms up to her estranged Uncle .

Plenty of action and the best part of the film is that the horror is graphic . Those Raimi guys are not slouchy with the F / X . Also in the cast are : Embeth Davidtz , Ian Abercrombie and Marcus Gilbert . This requires a watch party and a spare pair of underwear .
Where have all the " good " men gone ?	A real nice romantic comedy . Your family always seems to know the best for you . When it comes to love , its a crap shoot . Sarah ( Diane Lane ) is a pretty divorced pre-school teacher that is dateless and all but given up on love . . . until her sister ( Elizabeth Perkins ) posts a personal ad on a website declaring that all potential dates " must love dogs " .

Love hurts ; aggression with passion .	Based very loosely on the work of Nathaniel Hawthorne . Forbidden love , patience and stout convictions . I really enjoyed this despite the bad reviews . In 1666 Massachusetts a married woman ( Demi Moore ) falls in love with the young reverend ( Gary Oldman ) of the colony . Her husband ( Robert Duvall ) is believed to be part of an Indian massacre on his following arrival to the new world . Duvall's character is actually captured by the Algonquian tribe and forced to live among them . He then vents his wrath on his wife , who is expecting a child from her affair with her lover . Very good acting and wonderful scenery . I did not mind the two plus hours length of this romantic drama . There is some nudity , just enough to spice things up . . . but the violence is bloody and harsh . I found this version of THE SCARLET LETTER to be sensuous , interesting and very entertaining . Moore , Oldman and Duvall were excellent . Notable in support are Joan Plowright , Robert Prosky and Edward Hardwicke . This is worth your effort to watch .
What neighborhood doesn't have a . . . Monster House ! ?	Adventurous animated feature ; CGI enhanced and at times constructed with visual brilliance . " Shrek " , " Nemo " and even " Cars " fear not ; MONSTER HOUSE is just not THAT good ; but nonetheless a hoot to watch . The photography is better than a lot out there . Some of the humor may actually go over the heads of the prepubescent throngs with eyes glued to the bright and colorful screen . It helps to have well liked characters . DJ ( Mitchel Musso ) lives right across the street from an old house owned by Mr . Nebbercracker ( Steve Buscemi ) . DJ and his friend Chowder ( Sam Lerner ) lose a ball to the crotchety geezer , who has a heart attack before the boys can get their ball back .

With his faith in God , he returns home only to decide to study to become a priest and introduce Christianity to the poor and enslaved people of Ireland . His deeds led him to becoming the second Bishop of Ireland . Very informative look at this fifth century personage . His reported use of the shamrock as an illustration of the Holy Trinity led to its being regarded as the Irish national symbol . A very talented cast featuring Patrick Bergin as the adult Patrick and Luke Griffin as the young Patrick . Malcolm McDowell , Alan Bates and Susannah York seemed flawless .
Heavy heat in the night .	Murder , politics , sex and scandal ; and it is all about a girl in a blue dress . An out of work WWII vet ( Denzel Washington ) is trapped in a web of lies , backstabbing and flying lead when he agrees to look for a politician's girlfriend ( Jennifer Beals ) . Some real good movie music by the likes of Memphis Slim , Duke Ellington , Roy Brown and Jimmy Witherspoon . Very apt support from : Tom Sizemore , Don Cheadle and Lisa Nicole Carson . One steamy sex scene scorches and redeems .
Count down three minutes till Doomsday .	Excellent military drama with more intrigue and thrills than action . There is a clash of wills between the Captain ( Gene Hackman ) and his Lt . Commander ( Denzel Washington ) aboard the nuclear submarine USS Alabama . The mission is to avert an impending nuclear conflict with Russia . Hackman and Washington are tense and superb . Other submariners include : Viggo Mortensen , Rocky Carrol , Matt Craven , George Dzunda and James Gandolfini . Man the torpedos and stand by . You will witness that thin line between wrong and right .
The strength of honor is put to the test .	A very good TNT original movie made for TV . A former Army Lieutenant ( Don Johnson ) sees his world falling apart when allegations that his platoon slaughtered innocent civilians thirty years ago in a hospital massacre . Jeanne Tripplehorn plays the Army Major prosecutor . The defending attorney is played flawlessly by Arlin Howard . Also in the cast is Sharon Lawrence as the Lieutenant's lovely wife ; John Heard as the platoon member " blowing the whistle " and Johnson's son Jesse plays the young Lieutenant in Vietnam . Good courtroom drama . Well worth watching . It's also nice seeing Johnson letting go of some of the ego . He is aging nicely and still can command a scene .
With wealth comes opulence and hatred .	M-G-M's overstuffed costume drama traces Marie Antoinette's ( Norma Shearer ) life from Austrian princess , marriage , motherhood , Queen of France and her beheading . The arranged marriage to Louis XVI ( Robert Morley ) , the Dauphin of France , brought about estrangement and hatred from the French populace and eventually a spark for the Revolution . M-G-M borrowed Tyrone Power from 20th Century Fox to play the Swedish Count Axel de Fersen , who entered a romantic dalliance with Marie . The cast was over loaded with star-power : John Barrymore , Anita Louise , Reginald Gardner , Gladys George , Joseph Schildkraut , Henry Stephenson , Albert Dekker and George Meeker . The 2 hr and 40 minute run time is well spent .

' Paulie ' ( Piper Perabo ) and ' Tori ' ( Jessica Pare ) are forced to end their torrid affair and realize what it really was . One is ready to let go . . . the other isn't .

First is first and second is nothing .	A very good gangster flick and evocative film-noir directed by Joseph H . Lewis .

Conte's character is relentless as he rules his corrupt world with murder , gunplay and torture . Lee Van Cleef and Earl Holliman are his minions and Brian Donlevy is a handicapped mentor of sorts .

C . after a top-secret agent is kidnapped and murdered after passing off hidden valuable microfilm inside the cover of a matchbook .

Chilling . Griping drama . Alcatraz comes tumbling down .	Two actors at their very best . A fact-based story that led to the demise of the much feared Alcatraz Prison . Kevin Bacon's touching performance is the focus of this drama about a youth , whose cruel imprisonment in the 1930s comes to the attention of a steadfast young attorney ( Christian Slater ) .

Pre-Historic epic falls short of hype .	Director Roland Emmerich's 10 , 000 BC is very likable , but really fails to garner the interest created by its trailers .

A pretty young woman Evolet ( Camilla Belle ) is kidnapped and her admirer D'Leh ( Steven Strait ) will go on a bold trek in hopes of bringing her home .

Also in the cast : Cliff Curtis , Joel Virgel , Affif Ben Badra , Mona Hammond , Marco Khan , Nathaniel Baring and narration by the great Omar Sharif .
Apple , peach , strawberry and Bad Baby Pie .	A little strange , but funny romantic comedy . The characters really make the movie .

Marines preparing and landing on the small island in the South Pacific ; not only is there the danger of the entrenched Japanese forces , this devoted platoon battles treacherous terrain , disease and torrential weather . There is also the inner loneliness in spite of faithful camaraderie . An action-packed story told through the eyes of a war correspondent ( Reed Hadley ) . You can always count on the Marines . One of my favorite sequences is as the movie ends with the war tested leaving the island and passing the new green soldiers having no idea what they are in for . An all star cast makes for one of the best war movies of its era . Starring : Lloyd Nolan , William Bendix , Preston Foster , Roy Roberts , Anthony Quinn , Richard Jaeckel and Richard Conte .

R2-D2 and C-3PO are minor characters in this episode and to utter enjoyment the annoying Jar-Jar Binks is limited to just a couple of minutes screen time . The attack of the Clones is short of awesome and well worth the big build up . Also in the cast are : Samuel L . Jackson as Mace Windu , Ian McDiarmid as Chancellor Palpatine , Pernilla August as Shmi Skywalker-Lars and Jack Thompson as Cliegg Lars .

There is only one Christ .	Whether your faith is abundant or oblivious , this powerful movie will stir your conscience .

Jesus goes to the Garden of Olives to pray after the Last Supper ; as the betrayal of Judas Iscariot ( Luca Lionello ) leads to His being arrested and taken back to Jerusalem , where His savage and bloody Crucifixion is set in place at the hands of Pontius Pilate ( Hristo Shopov ) .

Others of note in the cast : Monica Belluci , Francesco De Vito , Maia Morgensten and Hristo Jivkov .
World of tomorrow is here today .	Nearly a decade of scheming and dreaming and hours upon hours of hard work puts writer and director Kerry Conran's fantasy on the silver screen . . . or should we say " blue screen " .

Brilliant and combustible . . . The Stones !	Martin Scorsese and the Rolling Stones . . . neither actually needs the exposure or the money . SHINE A LIGHT just tacks on to the legacy . Mick Jagger , Keith Richards , Charlie Watts and Ron Wood are all here and Scorsese fidgets for awhile trying to figure out how to film them . This documentary was filmed at the Beacon Theater in New York as the Stones were working through their Bigger Bang tour in 2006 . Raw , volatile , high-octane , bad-ass rock ' n ' roll . Longevity serves the band well . Well , it hasn't hurt them much . After Bill Clinton opens , the classic band runs through tunes lesser known as well as the legendary , such as " Start Me Up " , " Brown Sugar " , " Satisfaction " , " Shattered " and " Tumbling Dice " . They welcome guest stars Jack White , Buddy Guy and Christina Aguilera . There are old clips of the band billed as the World's Greatest Rock ' n ' Roll Band as well as exclusive behind-the-scenes moments and excerpts from TV and news footage . Mick struts and Keith smokes ; the atmosphere is electric and it is about as close as you're going to get without dodging sweat in person . My favorite sequence : " The Girl With The Far Away Eyes " . Fan or not . . . a musical experience .
Most memorable horror film of all time .	This movie is a classic that shall live for generations to come . An ambitious doctor ( Colin Clive ) creates life in a creature assembled from organs and limbs of the dead . Boris Karloff , as the Monster , becomes a horror movie icon . The lighting , crude camera work , sound and special effects combine to make a simple movie a masterpiece . The image of the Frankenstein monster will always stand for fear of the uncontrolled .
A random call for help .	David Ellis directs this stressful action thriller . School teacher Jessica Martin ( Kim Basinger ) is kidnapped in order to find her husband .

Why are the kidnappers so ruthless in the hopes of attaining what Jessica's husband ( Adam Taylor Gordon ) has in his possession ? Helping Ryan is a 27 year veteran cop ( William H . Macy ) , who just wants to retire and own a health spa . Pretty much non-stop action with little time to rest . This movie is a lot better than what you may have expected .

Triumph against heavy odds .	Ron Howard directs this heartwarming story of Jim J . Braddock ( Russell Crowe ) , whose promising boxing career hit the skids about the time of the Great Depressions . Stuggeling to make ends meet for his family , his long time manager Joe Gould ( Paul Giamatti ) got him the chance to change his luck . Braddock , in 1934 , had upset wins against Corn Griffin and John Henry Lewis . This set up the shot for the title against the much feared heavyweight champ Max Baer ( Craig Bierko ) , who had already killed two men in the ring . Jim was a 10 to 1 underdog , but traded punches with the bigger Baer and won the championship . Two years later , Braddock lost the crown by a KO delivered by Joe Louis . Jim Braddock gave a down-trodden populace a hero to look up to and was bestowed the nickname of the Cinderella Man . Other cast members : Renee Zellweger as J . J . ' s wife Mae along with Bruce McGill , David Huband and Paddy Considine . Once again director Howard evokes excellence providing some very realistic and graphic boxing scenes . He also found bit parts for his dad Rance and brother Clint . This movie could easily also be called a love story . . . as well as a story of patience , courage and determination .
Forest Whitaker at the top of his game as Idi Amin .	Stunning and riveting movie . Forest Whitaker is absolutely excellent .

Allow yourself to live . Can a person be too smart ?	SMART PEOPLE is a temperamental comedy that puts focus on a dysfunctional family you can't help but like . Complicated characters that can be tolerated because of who they are . Afterall family is family even if every member lives in their own world . Lawrence Wetherhold ( Dennis Quaid ) is a widower and very self-absorbed professor . Misunderstood mostly and definitely not one who has mastered social skills . The professor begins dating one of his former students , Janet Hartigan ( Sarah Jessica Parker ) , who is now an emergency room doctor . His dating is his first since the death of his wife and doesn't sit well with his over achieving daughter Vanessa ( Ellen Page ) . Adding to the mix is Lawrence's adopted brother Chuck ( Thomas Hayden Church ) , who you may say is a lay-about , unmotivated freeloader . Life is only as complicated as you make it . The character interaction is at times hilarious . There seems to be a dry wit that prevails . And you really do care about these people . This movie is by all means interesting with engaging characters . Page is excellent as the sharp-tongued genius . Church is surprisingly more than ordinary . Believable , smart and highly recommended .
Fear preserves the spectacle of life .	Martin Scorsese directs a savage and brutal masterpiece . A young boy ( Leonardo DiCaprio ) witnesses the killing of his father the Priest Vallon ( Liam Neeson ) . Amsterdam Vallon ( DiCaprio ) returns from a fifteen year or so stay in reform school to the Five Points area of NYC seeking revenge against Bill the Butcher ( Daniel Day-Lewis ) , his father's killer . Bill is a racist bully and believes he is the king of New York , or at least his own little corner of the world . Amsterdam gets in the good graces of the Butcher only to plot his demise . Along the way the young Vallon meets a pocket picking whore Jenny ( Cameron Diaz ) and reluctantly falls in love . The tribes of the city are summoned for the mother of all knock down drag out duels with the Butcher and Amsterdam intent on slaying the other . The scenes of 1840s and 1860s New York City are awesome . Great photography and camera work . The most dramatic scene is of the blood covered and body cluttered snow at the film's beginning . This of course seems tame compared to the carnage that brings this epic to a close . Day-Lewis is commanding in his role of the Butcher , one the most egotistical and racist savage characters unable to escape your memory . DiCaprio seems an awkward choice for his role and at times seems unlikely to achieve his character's accomplishments . Diaz was down right fetching and I still believe she could tempt a dead man . Also in the cast are Jim Broadbent , Brendan Gleeson , David Hemmings , Joseph P . Reidy , Henry Thomas and John C . Reilly . Sometimes a little bit too wordy and slow , but still this almost three hour film is strong enough to hold your interest and imagination . In spite of the nay-sayers I believe Scorcese is a master among his peers . And being Irish is no requirement for feeling some pride or sorrow .
Grissly violent double feature not to be missed .	Strong graphic violence , blood , guts , gore , exploitation , gratuitous nudity and every kind of inappropriate material possible . . . and too damn much fun to miss out on .

Things really heat up when they meet Stuntman Mike ( Kurt Russell ) . GRINDHOUSE is an experience and pleasurable indulgence full of explosions , fast cars , big breasts , fist fights , splattering blood , big breasts , car crashes , disembowelment , bigger explosions , bigger breasts , lewd and lascivious action and vulgar inappropriate language . Talk about an ensemble cast . . . just a few of the other familiar players : Josh Brolin , Jeff Fahey , Vanessa Ferlito , Danny Trejo , Michael Parks , Mary Elizabeth Winstead , Zoe Bell , Marcy Harriell , Bruce Willis , Eli Roth , Tarantino and a Nicolas Cage cameo .

Also of note in the cast : Martin Donovan , Blair Brown and Raynor Scheine .
Tremendous thriller . Classic Hitchcock .	In ' 54 , I was seven years old and this is one of the first ' grown up ' movies I remember seeing . I have seen it at least ten times since and realize seeing something different each time . James Stewart is a photographer in a wheelchair recovering from an accident . He passes the time by watching his neighbors out his apartment window . He thinks that he witnessed a murder and has trouble convincing his girlfriend , Grace Kelly , to help prove a crime was committed . Three scenes that always stuck with me : ( 1 ) Stewart fighting off his attacker with flashbulbs ( 2 ) the smoldering kiss ( 3 ) the glowing cigarette in the dark apartment . Every bit a classic . I think this is THE BEST Hitchcock movie . No offense intended toward PSYCHO , but this movie has the more human aspects of fear and terror . This super cast includes Raymond Burr , Thelma Ritter and Wendell Corey .
Entertaining and enjoyable epic .	I have no idea where the discouraging words are coming from about this film . Beautifully photographed and two stars very easy to watch . Set against the brink of World War II Australia , a romantic and intense adventure unfolds . Lady Sarah Ashely ( Nicole Kidman ) , an English aristocrat travels down under to check on her husband and their massive ranch . She finds that her husband has been murdered and the ranch is in jeopardy . Lady Sarah gets help from a cattle drover ( Hugh Jackman ) , who helps protect her property from a relentless and arrogant cattle baron King Carney ( Bryan Brown ) . Two thousand head of cattle need to be moved across hundreds of miles of outback to Darwin to win a military contract . Kudos to director Baz Luhrmann for creating this cinematic masterpiece that combines drama , adventure , romance and comedy . Also in the cast : David Wenham , Brandon Walters , David Gulpilil , Ben Mendelsohn , Tony Barry and Jack Thompson .
