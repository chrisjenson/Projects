Ten reasons to see JAWS 3 -	1 . It has a huge rubber shark in it 2 . It has Dennis Quaid in it - and he gets eaten by the shark 3 . Dennis Quaid does not actually get eaten by the shark , but it would be fun if he was eaten by it as it would seriously shorten the length of the movie 4 . Arnold Schwarzenegger's " hilarious " cameo as Bruno the Killer Shark - classic stuff ! 5 . Danny DeVito as his " Twin " brother ! ! 6 . Arnie and Danny joining Dennis Quaid in a musical rendition of " Born to Be Wild " , followed by lots of back-slapping and bestiality with the killer shark 7 . A Great White Shark managing to infiltrate a remote and highly guarded sea park in an effort to seek vengeance on . . . umm . . . one guy related to a guy who killed its mother / brother / sister / etc in the first film . 8 . The movie is so wandering and pointless that half of it has nothing to do with the rest of it - it starts as a cheesy " I got my arm bit off by a shark help me ! ! ! " movie and then turns into a promotion for a Beach Boys musical ( don't ask ) 9 . Product placement - how subtle ! 10 . If you do not support this movie , there will be no " JAWS 5 " - and we all know we want it to be made as soon as possible ! Oh , and a bonus 11th reason : Steven Spielberg's cameo as the tourist who runs up to the camera yelling " Stop the awfulness ! They've sold out ! They've denied my artistic vision of this series ! " before getting devoured by a shark . Oh , wait , that wasn't part of the movie - it really happened .
Meet the Gazillionth Rip-off of " Bill and Ted " . . .	" Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure " had a certain charm to it . A wit if you will . It chronicled the lives of deep , yet shallow-acting characters . They were entertaining to see on screen ; the situations they got into even more so . But alas , there is none of this obvious humor in the most heinous rip-off of Bill and Ted to this day , " Meet the Deedles . " " Meet the Deedles " was a movie made for one reason , and one reason only : To cash in on a once-was film franchise . Bill and Ted's two adventures were time-pieces ; a look into the eighties . But one can see why this technique failed in the sequel , " Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey , " because by then ( 1991 ) audiences had grown weary of eighties teenagers in heinous situations . Film companies should have learned then that while Bill and Ted were once good , and always will be , MORE of the same kind is tiring . They tried a lot of films in the same tradition , but they all flopped . ( " Bio Dome " . ) The original is the only thing worth seeing again ; not sequels or rip-offs , because their time has passed . But " Meet the Deedles " ignores this and gives the audience something about ten years too late for its own good . The movie's only true ambition is to create mindless slapstick and generate a series in the tradition of the ' ' Bill & Ted ' ' movies . It really does neither . The story involves twin brothers Stew and Phil Deedle ( Steve Van Wormer and Paul Walker ) , slackers from Hawaii who find themselves in the middle of a fiendish plot to sabotage Old Faithful in Yellowstone National Park . One day Stew and Phil are hanging beneath a balloon being towed above the Hawaiian surf , while being pursued by a truant officer on a Jet Ski . When they reach ground , their millionaire father ( Eric Braeden ) realizes he must put a plan of his own into action : Send the two surf-bums to Camp Broken Spirit , a monthlong experience in outdoor living that will turn them into men . Through a series of truly mind-numbing and brain-tumbling actions , the Twin Deedle Dudes , who may as well be referred to as Bill and Ted , are mistaken for park ranger recruits upon their arrival at camp . They come under the command of Ranger Pine ( John Ashton ) , and stumble onto the solution to a mysterious infestation of prairie dogs . Prairie dogs . My , oh my . Praire dogs . Where do I start ? Perhaps I'll tell you why millions of them are scurrying about . It's quite simple , really . Too simple . An evil former ranger named Slater ( Dennis Hopper ) has trained them to burrow out a cavern around Old Faithful , allowing him to redirect the geyser's boiling waters in the direction of New Faithful , to which he plans to sell tickets . A whole lot of work when he could just use some machinery to re-route the water . But that would be too basic for a film as stupid and mindless as this . No , Slater as to have prairie dogs chew around the geyser . Truly awful . Hopper lives in his underground cavern , along with his sidekick Nemo , played by Robert Englund , Freddy of the ' ' Nightmare on Elm Street ' ' pictures . At one point he explains how he trained the prairie dogs , and I quote , ' ' Inject kibble into the dirt , and a-tunneling they would go . ' ' I never thought I would ever hear Dennis Hopper say such a thing . But he did , and I am forever scarred . While he schemes , the Deedles fumble and bumble their way through ranger training . None of these scenes are remotely funny , nor hilarious as they should have been . Yet with all this criticism , " Meet the Deedles " is also kind of fun to watch . It's so lousy that it almost comes off as original . It's worth seeing alone just for Dennis Hopper's crazy line I mentioned above . But I would not recommend you go out and rent the film ; rather , wait until it is on TV . I am split between my outlook on " Meet the Deedles . " It is certainly one of the worst films I have ever seen , but it is not unwatchably bad like other bad children's flicks . I saw a TV-film two years ago named " P . U . N . K . S . " , and while the lousiness of it is much on the same level as " Meet the Deedles , " its watchability ( yes , I made up that word ) differs . " Meet the Deedles " is just awful . " P . U . N . K . S . " is even worse . Only watch " Meet the Deedles " if there's nothing on TV . But I don't recommend it to you as a good film , but rather an awful one . See it and witness pure stinkiness on film . Whatever it tried to steal from " Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure " is not apparent . Whatever was stolen was not stolen properly . . stars ( half a star ) . John Ulmer
National Lampoon's ANIMAL Vacation . . .	SOME SPOILERSSummer sequels are usually bad enough , but when it comes to straight-to-video sequels . . . ? They're even worse . " Beethoven's 3rd " does nothing to change that . Judge Reinhold , once an actor who actually appeared in theatrical releases , stars as one of the seemingly endless Newton bunches . His brother , once played by the ten-times-better Charles Grodin ( who has long since ended his film career and gone on to write books and become a news journalist for CBS ) , has dropped off the Saint Bernard Beethoven on his brother and his wife ( Julia Sweeney ) before they go on an RV trip . Aww , what a cruel thing to do . But , in reality , it's just as easy way of getting a sequel put together . Grodin won't come back ? Get him a brother and avoid his appearance in the film ! For example , at the end of the film , Reinhold is supposed to meet up with his brother , where they are politely informed by some old man that the original Newtons are still in Europe . Most likely for another year . Another YEAR ? ! ? ! Boy , how did they jump from a week to a year in Europe ? Perhaps the film execs coaxed them into it . . . The thing with " Beethoven's 3rd " is that it doesn't even try to come off witty , or even funny at that . Countless gags just do not work . Take a typical example : the bad guys in the film are a hyper-active caffeine addict and a " Star Wars " - quoting freak , both of whom are supposed to be funny but are not . In one scene they are trying to get into the Newtons ' RV to steal a DVD ( long story ) . They run around like children with little black capes on . Before they do so , they equip themselves with night-vision-goggles and a type of spray that blinds people . We hear Baddie 1 say , " Now , whatever you do , do NOT look at light with your goggles on , and do NOT release your spray ! " We know exactly what's going to happen next , and sure enough - - no surprises here - - they look at light and release their gas cannisters . I mean , how bleeping obvious can you bleeping get ? The filming style seems like a ten-year-old directed it . A mentally-challenged ten-year-old . In one bit , Reinhold is supposed to be struggling in an RV with Beethoven , and to make it look like the RV is shaking , the director wiggles around a handheld camera , left and right , left and right . That trick is one of the oldest in the book . In the " Cheap Effects " book . What was their budget - - two dollars ? And then , with all of that , the humor is literally non-existent . Instead of being at least AMUSING and SLIGHTLY FUNNY like the original " Beethoven " film ( which I like mainly because it is a sweet , good-natured family film ) , this flick single-handedly rips off every genre and every joke . Ever . At times it's a bad mix between " National Lampoon's Vacation " and " Turner and Hootch , " at other times a rip-off of " Star Wars " and " Meet Joe Black . " See what I mean by bad combinations ? And furthermore , this sequel is completely cashing in on the first two flicks . I can put up with certain things in films , but I feel the most cheated when I know that a sequel was slip-shoddly put together to bring in some money and nothing more . That is when I really hate a film . But " Beethoven's 3rd " is still one of the worst films I've seen in a long , long time , regardless of being a cheap sequel . The gags aren't there , the wit isn't there , the attaching and likable characters aren't there , the dialogue isn't there . Heck , the entire movie isn't there . Followed by an equally-horrible 4th ( and 5th ? ) sequel ( s ) , I'd say this franchise is dead weight . What was once amusing and interesting because of attaching characters and a light-hearted script is now another chip off the ol ' sequel-cash-in block . Avoid at all costs . stars - John Ulmer
You know how you've heard this movie is really bad ? Well , whoever told you that is RIGHT . . .	" 48 Hours " - - two mismatched cops . " Red Heat " - - two mismatched cops . " Lethal Weapon " - - two mismatched cops . Do we really need any more entries into this genre ? No . But at least the preceeding films had either a level of wit or chemistry - - perhaps both - - that made them quality entertainment . " The Presidio , " a cop-buddy film with Sean Connery and Mark Harmon , is nothing special at all . It's routine and boring , and if that wets your lips then dig in . Mark Harmon plays a Chicago cop brought in to investigate the murder of a fellow officer of the law . Sean Connery is his Scottish partner , a hard-nosed fellow with an attractive daughter ( played by Meg Ryan ) who takes a liking to Harmon ( by matter of script cliches ) . They hit it off much to the chagrin of her father , who continues to be paired with the young American . They end up in the usual car chases and on-foot pursuits . Action purses around just about every corner . There's a chase where Harmon is leaping over the hoods of cars and Sean Connery is dragging behind , looking very much out of breath and tired . But this is a boring film - - one that put me to sleep in the first minute and , from the looks of it , many other people , too . Connery tries hard to fight against the material , but Harmon is the film's primary flaw - - he's like Kevin Costner on sleeping medication . Meg Ryan is the typical sweet Girl Next Door love interest , but she would display much more acting skills in the next year's " When Harry Met Sally " with Billy Crystal . The script leaps all logic . It's as bleak , dry and typical as a film in this genre can get . I expected a nice source of entertainment in this film . It not only does not entertain , it literally repulses the viewer . Sean Connery and Mark Harmon have no chemistry on-screen . They pretty much just run about screaming at each other . Sean Connery has the Straight Man role that Arnold Schwarzenegger , Danny Glover and Nick Nolte have all played before . Which leaves room for the Comic Loose Man . But Harmon isn't a comical guy , and he isn't as loose as he is just plain ignorant . This is a poor example of buddies . The movie was directed by Peter Hyams , who obviously needs a lesson in how to properly construct a fast-paced and engaging cop-buddy film . This movie suffers from lack of pace and lack of solid direction - - one of its biggest flaws apart from casting decisions . Not only that , but the writer , Larry Ferguson , needs to take some lessons in how to cross the boundaries of a regular script and breathe into his characters life . There's a difference between written characters and typed characters . His are in the latter category . The movie is 97 minutes long and it feels two times longer . I recently saw a buddy flick called " Hollywood Homicide " with Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett . Even that film was better than this - - and " Hollywood " is making my list of the worst films of 2003 . Only really big fans of Sean Connery should venture near this . And the fans of Mark Harmon should all be taken out to a field and shot . stars . - John Ulmer
" The Good Son " is a " good " example of how not to make a " good " thriller .	" The Good Son " is a " good " example of how not to make a thriller . Not only is it stupid , it's disturbing seeing filmmakers having an eleven-year-old kill people . The film starts out with Elijah Wood going to live with his Aunt and Uncle after his mother dies , because his father has a business deal in Japan ( or something like that ) . Upon arrival at his relatives ' home , he meets Macaulay Culkin , who makes a startling appearance in a mask . The boys become friends , but Wood starts to see things happening . Culkin kills a dog with a nail-gun he created . And then he tries to kill his sister ( numerous times ) . And then we find out that years ago , Culkin's little brother drowned in the bathtub while Culkin was looking over him ( we find out later he killed the boy because his brother got one of his toys - - a rubber duck - - and he wanted it back ) . So then Wood has to convince everyone that Culkin is a homicidal maniac with serious problems before the sister dies . I read a review of Roger Ebert's on this film , and it's exactly what stuck out at me when I originally watched the film : What kind of filmmakers have a small child in a role where he is killing people ? Especially when the film has with a kid killing off his family members . It's just wrong to do when children are at that young an age . And furthermore , why cast Culkin ? Macaulay Culkin is one of the worst child actors I've seen in a long time , and luckily his reign has ended . Now we have Haley Joel Osment , who actually has gained the honor of being a good child actor . Let's contrast between the two , shall we ? In " The Sixth Sense , " Osment delivers many speeches where he cries or acts frightened . In " The Good Son , " Culkin delivers a speech to Wood while they are standing at the refrigerator . He mumbles every badly-written line helplessly . He stares at Wood , motionless , without facial expressions . He looks like he's reading his lines off the top of Wood's forehead . Now , you could say his part calls for no emotions , but this kid ALWAYS has that look on his face in ALL his movies . I mean , other than his role in " Uncle Buck , " the kid just can't act . " Home Alone " was a good film . . . but not because of him . That was due to a great script and great supporting cast . And that's it . " The Good Son " is not only disturbing , but very mediocre in what it is . It's just like all those eighties so-called " thrillers " that came out that were no more than 90 minutes of basic chills . The script is awful . But one of the worst things about this film is the fact that it seems written for / by children . . . yet it is in no way suitable for children . At all . It's a sick , twisted film that tries to be both a thriller / chiller , and a kids ' movie . It's neither . stars -
Awful !	This is quite an awful little film . It is slow-paced , stiff-acted and boring . Of course , considering the main cast are two twin eight year olds , that comes as no surprise . Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen got fame from " Full House , " an emotionally controlling and contrived television show . I always thought the " little kid " they had on the show was a bad actress ( es ) . Now , they have spun off countless " mystery films " and cheap little straight-too-video movies . I am surprised anyone thought these little girls had talent , but then again , everyone thought Macauley Culkin was great , so everybody will probably think these twins are the best ever ! stars - - John Ulmer
The novelty has worn off fast	I used to watch " Fear Factor " every week when it first started airing because it was a unique reality show ( a genre I hate to begin with ) and kind of interesting . It seemed daring and I enjoyed watching the contestants go through all the crazy challenges , it was sort of fun in a guilty pleasure way . But enough is enough . Joe is really milking his whole hosting experience for what it's worth - - appearing , ironically , on " Got Milk ? " ads . Ten years from now he'll be sitting in a dumpster wearing a " I Was A Reality TV Show Host " T-shirt . The show has simply become a bore - the novelty has worn thin . They keep trying to introduce " new " challenges but after you've seen a few , you've seen ' em all . Once in a while they get really sexy babes to strip to their underwear for underwater challenges , which is just plain sad , shameless exploitation for the sake of gaining a wider audience and attracting viewers . Then they'll have the special " Fear Factor : Victoria's Secret Episode " where they have supermodels playing the challenges . Joe always looks like he's really enjoying himself during these episodes . " Fear Factor " used to be fun but nowadays I've found it's just pretty lame . It's not interesting anymore , it's not amusing , and it's simply not as unique as it was four years ago .
Confessions of a Viewer Who Hated This Movie .	I generally don't berate films here on IMDb that I don't think deserve a thorough bashing . When rating movies I usually take into consideration their genre , audience demographic and such . For example , judging a standard family movie like " Madagascar " against some type of epic adult feature such as " The Godfather " would be ridiculous - different genre , different crowd , different goal as a movie . But " Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen " doesn't even stack up against other family films of its kind . It's equally insulting for children and adults alike . On one level it begs to be some type of satirical comment on drama queens and materialism , but that's EXACTLY what the film falls victim to - its lead character , played by the despicable Lindsay Lohan , is a trashy drama queen who apparently spends all her free time lusting after a hunky teen icon . And just knowing about Lohan's drama queen antics in real life makes this character seem just a little bit too realistic . She's supposed to be the heroine of this film , but after five minutes I already hated her . And I'm not a prepossessed Lohan basher - I enjoyed her performance ( or , rather , performances ) in the Parent Trap remake - but she is just completely irritating here . The plot line is borderline idiotic and a very generic run-of-the-mill pre-teen flick : a rich brat has to move to a new place and leave all her friends behind , but the twist here - ARE YOU READY FOR IT ? ? Because it's an absolutely brilliant one - anyway , the twist here is that . . . get ready for it . . . she's a DRAMA QUEEN ! Haha ! Somebody give the screenwriter who came up with this concept a few million , because that's absolutely brilliant . As if any other character in a flick like this isn't already dramatic enough - making the character a drama queen just makes her consistent whining even all the MORE enjoyable ! ( Not . ) I really came away hating this movie . It left me with a bad feeling in my gut . There's something kind of sleazy and insulting about it . It's supposed to appeal to our daughters , but I don't think I'd want any daughter of mine looking up to Lindsay Lohan - especially in a role like THIS - as any type of role model . Maybe it's just me but I feel no sympathy for a character as unlikeable as the one in this movie . Sorry , Ms . Lohan .
Completely terrible . I feel sorry for Leslie Nielsen .	Watching this on television the other day , I instantly felt great remorse for star Leslie Nielsen . After the success of the " Naked Gun " series , he has been restricted to a career of playing the same character over . . . and over . . . and over . . . . This time , he is US Marshall " Dick " Dix ( the first of many human anatomy puns / so-called " jokes " ) . I wonder how long it took them to come up with that one in the writing room . " How about Agent Butt K . Isser ? " " How about Agent T . Itz ? " " No , wait guys ! I've got it ! Dick Dix ! Haha we're comedic geniuses ! " The budget is very obviously on the low end . Special effects are terrible . The film tries to lampoon the space travel segments of Kubrick's " 2001 " and fails miserably . Nielsen sucks food through a straw and can't manage to get it up the straw the whole way . Hahaha I chuckled all night thinking of that one ! Or how about the woman in the back of the space shuttle who has huge breasts and manages to accidentally shed out of her clothes , which float around and slap Nielsen in the face ? No , it couldn't have been the ugly fat woman whose clothes magically disappear . . . it's the busty blonde . . . I love Hollywood .
A story that is engaging and interesting . . . only for it to be transformed into a kind of large budget monster movie towards the end . . .	Dreamcatcher - StarsREVIEW BY JOHN ULMERWhat went wrong in the second half of " Dreamcatcher " ? Here we are given a story that is engaging and interesting , only for it to be transformed into a kind of large budget monster movie towards the end . It is as if all the characters go awry , the screenplay hits a hard block in the road , and the plausability collapses . Rarely has a film so withered away in the second half as " Dreamcatcher . " The movie is based on the novel by Stephen King , a book I tried desperately to get into some months ago , only to give up a few pages in . It was a day when I had borrowed two of King's books from a local library and bought one , finally forcing myself to sit down and judge for myself if the much-hyped Stephen King lived up to his name . I bought and loved " Misery , " but the other I read , " Cujo , " was unbearably awful and stupid , and " Dreamcatcher " interested me but lost me with its odd sense of narrative . I won't complain about the 800-some page novel since I did not read it , but from what I can tell , William Goldman , who co-wrote " Dreamcatcher " with Lawrence Kasdan ( and also penned " Misery " for Rob Reiner ) , cannot be blamed for getting lost in translation . The novel seemed messy , and Goldman and Kasdan's script soon leaves behind all hope , too . The movie's setup was incredibly interesting , which is why the latter half was frustratingly terrible . Our tale begins some twenty years ago , when childhood friends , named Jonesey , Beaver , Pete and Henry save a mentally challenged boy from a pack of bullies . The boy gives them a gift of psychic telepathy in turn , and all four men can communicate between each other " without picking up a phone . " Flash forward twenty years : Jonesy ( Damian Lewis ) , Beaver ( Jason Lee ) , Pete ( Timothy Olyphant ) and Henry ( Thomas Jane ) all reunite in a log cabin during a blizzard in Maine . As fate would have it , a mysterious alien force is at work . A lost man shows up at the men's cabin , only to have a strange creature force its way out of his . . . well . . . bottom . The creature kills Beaver and an alien named Mr . Gray infects Jonesey . This is where the movie starts to get . . . odd . Jonesey remains inside his mind by locking himself up inside his Memory Warehouse , a subconscious warehouse visualized by Kasdan as a bunch of rooms containing Jonesy's memories . This effect reminds me of a type of " Alice in Wonderland " fable , of a man locked inside his own brain ( okay , that wasn't in " Alice in Wonderland " but it's the same type of thing ) . It's interesting , but doesn't fit into the film . It's just too weird for what had appeared at first to be a serious film . The film features Morgan Freeman's name ahead of everyone else's on the posters , yet Freeman turns up belatedly in this movie , thirty-five minutes in ( I checked my watch ! ) , and utters his first real line fifty minutes in . Freeman plays Col . Abraham Kurtz , the " Good Bad Guy " of this movie . Freeman is usually a compelling actor to watch on screen , especially in films like " Se7en . " There's Brad Pitt in one corner , speaking his mind , while Freeman stands there with watchful eyes , surveying his surroundings and really seeing what is going on around him . Not this time . He is one giant cliche in this movie , the hard-nosed military man who , along with the aliens , is a bad guy . He is the colonel who wants to kill innocent humans to eliminate the aliens , making his purpose justified but his means not . This technique of the Good Bad Guy always angers me , every time I see it , as I don't think audiences should be duped into having to decide between rooting for aliens and a military man . No wonder Goldman and Kasdan introduced him almost an hour in - - I assume that Goldman , an experienced screenwriter , realized Freeman's character would not get the audience's hopes up if he was introduced any earlier . An hour in the audience can't very well leave as voluntarily as they would in the first five minutes . And speaking of the cast , Jason Lee was the surprise for me in this film ; I hadn't really seen him before in any films . I haven't seen " Stealing Harvard " or any Kevin Smith films , so I had never really seen Lee on film before . He stole every scene as Beaver . Which figures , since he is the first killed . Tom Sizemore plays someone in this movie , who does the obvious and cliched , and he was extremely held back as compared to his usual self . Sizemore , who starred in " Saving Private Ryan , " " Black Hawk Down " and other military films as far as his mainstream films go , disappointed me . It's the terrible script , and Sizemore just went with the flow . There's a boundary between great alien movies and terrible ones . " Dreamcatcher " started off as an intriguing character study of four childhood friends with a mysterious power connecting them . The second half turned into another horrible B-monster-movie with a larger budget . Reader , I tried desperately to figure out what was happening and where the plot was going , but after the one hour mark I started getting lost , and by the end of the film I still didn't know what was going on and , to be quite honest , I didn't really care .
We've come a long way since " Star Wars . " Let's go back .	What can be said about a film based on a videogame ? Not much . Even " Tomb Raider " was better than this . The plot ? In the 27th century , Earth suffers attacks by the " Kilrathi Empire , " which captures a Navcom unit that allows their ships to jump directly to Earth and launch attacks before any prior alert . Freddy Prinze , Jr . is boasted in the position of top billing in this film , closely followed by Matthew Lillard . What does that tell you ? And hey , I even thought " Scooby-Doo " was harmless !
Stinker Alert !	I remember that there was much hype built up about this film upon its release . When it came out on video I was quite eager to see it . How unfortunate that it turned out to be a boring , weird , pointless film . David ( Haley Joel " Sixth Sense " Osment ) is eleven years old . Well , not really . He's a robot . A robot that wants to learn to love , or something all too familiar like that ( see another sappy movie , named " Bicentennial Man ( 1999 ) " ) Anyway , he goes on this magical journey with another robot , Deuce Bigalow Male Gigalo - - er , Joe Gigalo . Sorry . Continuing with our boring plot summary , David , being the dumb robot he is , wants to find the blue fairy from Pinochio to make a wish to be human . I've heard theories about the end SPOILERS that the aliens are not really aliens , that they are really robots that took over the world . Well , if they're smart enough to take over the human race , why is one dumb enough to search for a blue fairy that any human knows is fake ? Overall , I found the first half hour to be quite entertaining . But once the film reaches the point where SPOILERS David's " mother " drops him off in the woods , the film goes downhill and never gets back up . I couldn't wait for the movie to end . Steven Spielberg , unfortunately , didn't seem to KNOW when to end the film . The last half hour was one of the most boring film climaxes I have ever witnessed . Too bad , I usually like Steven's work . This and " Minority Report " had to be the most overrated movies of 2001 and 2002 respectively . stars - - John Ulmer
Take your pick .	210 minute version ( extremely hardcore , or so I hear ) or the R-rated version released into theaters ? Both are terribly awful , of course . Peter O'Toole and Malcolm McDowell have both claimed they wish they had never made this film ( the latter of the two men reported this in an IMDb interview ! ) , and I can see why . Nothing but a nonsensical mess of softcore porn and a half-hearted attempt at a plot . Not much of anything here , other than cheap tricks and stupid scenes . I liked what McDowell himself said about the film : " It was like one moment I'd be staring , admiring my mule or something , and the next scene would be two lesbians going at it . " How true . What an awful movie . stars .
Why , why couldn't they let it alone ?	The Blues Brothers is one of the most classic comedies of the past 25 years . Somehow , someone decided to mess up the legacy by creating a sequel . . . 18 years later . Dan Akyroyd returns as Ellwood Blues . He has just been released from jail , and trying to put the band back together again . Because of the real life death of John Belushi , the writers instead throw in John Goodman and a child as new band players . First of all , I want to point out that I respect in this film that when Ellwood tells Goodman about Jake , the writers didn't come up with " Oh , he's down in Florida vacationing " or something stupid excuse for his absence like that . At least they payed John the respect he deserved , and Ellwood tells him that " Jake died " paying some respect to John Belushi and his character , Jake Blues . Where they got the idea for a child to join the band is beyond me . Is this a guarantee PG-13 or what ? Obviously they decided to make this at least a PG-13 , and I think that is stupid . The original film was R , and sticking to it they should have done the same here . I like when there are family films , but this film is not ! There is a strip bar sequence , and yet this is PG-13 ? Come on ! As for these scenes , they paid absolutely nothing worthwhile to the film , other than filling in 20 minutes of stupid cheap gimmicks ( Ellwood gets on stage and sings blues as the strippers come out ) This is so dumb , and while the original had obvious dumb sequences , they came out funny-dumb , this film did not . It almost was not intended to be a real film , rather a joining of Akyroyd with Blues . They do not really care about the film itself . It's like a music video gone wrong . You'd expect to pick this video up and have a music CD pop out instead of a film . How anyone could think up such a lame excuse of a sequel is beyond me , and how Dan Akyroyd would ever join the cast again just completely mind boggling to me . What was Dan thinking ? Overall this film pays some respects to John Belushi's SNL and film legacy , but overall does more damage to him than honor . I am disgusted that Dan would do this to such a classic film , and such a classic comedian . John Belushi wasn't a favorite of mine , but he was pretty funny , and very controversial for the time . I think if he were around today he would've lost his career like Dan , Chevy , Steve , and Bill . Not that these hilarious guys don't do funny films anymore , but they don't do ENOUGH films , anymore ( especially Chevy , he has the most wasted career out of all ) So if you like cheap gimmicks and rip-offs of the first Blues Brothers film , by all means see Blues Brothers 2000 . But if you're like me and hate cheap gimmicks and unhonorable rip-offs , then stay clear of this flop . stars-JOHN ULMER

Classic erotic adventure is now dated and silly	" Barbarella " was famous ( or rather infamous ) when it came out because Jane Fonda was naked , her husband directed the movie and it was therefore quite controversial . Now it's come out that she / her book / tabloid magazines claim Roger Vadim used to make her have threesomes with other women . Somehow , it seems appropriate given the nature of this movie . It's intended to be an erotic adventure and the opening credits depict Fonda cruising around floating through her space craft absolutely naked . That's really all the movie is . Fonda running around ( or floating around ) wearing little , if anything at all . If that's your sort of thing , you'll probably dig this . Otherwise , stay far , far away .
Pretty dire .	This aired on Disney a few years back as one of their infamous " Original Movies . " The concept is something from a " Simpsons " Halloween episode : a computer home is won by a family and they move in only to find their lives dominated by a glitch in the system . In this case the glitch is a visual representation of a woman who seems to think she's the mother of the new family that's moved in . . . she takes control of their lives and locks them inside the house . Ryan Merriman plays the whiz-kid genius who wanted to win the house , then decides , " Hey , Dad , maybe we shouldn't have moved in here " . . . after having complained about wanting to throughout the entire beginning of the film . No Disney Original Movie is going to be very good and this follows all the clichés - bad actors , bad script , inept director at the helm ( probably a TV veteran and first-timer when it comes to film-making ) . Overall this is not really worth your time as it is something " The Simpsons " managed to do in 30 minutes and even their version seemed more realistic and less insulting than this . . .
A huge mess	Word was leaked early that this film was a disaster . Test screenings went miserably and the ending had to be re-filmed . It sat on the shelves for close to a year . Nicole Kidman said nasty things about director Frank Oz behind his back , and the cast and crew in turn said things about her . Matthew Broderick said it was one of his worst filming experiences of his career . And then the movie came out and flopped . It deserved to . It's a huge mess - an uninspired , silly , over-the-top , stupid , insulting , smug , self-conscious little " comedy " that is too nice to be dark and too dark to be nice . The first half is pretty clever and I found it amusing . Nicole Kidman has a nervous breakdown and moves out of the city with her husband ( Broderick ) to get away from the chaos . Once there they find a home in a small community named Stepford , begun by a local millionaire ( Christopher Walken ) . She makes some friends with neighbors Jon Lovitz and Bette Midler , but soon realizes the local " perfect wives " are indeed just that - and may in fact be robots . The movie tries to be a satire of our repression of women's rights and so on and so forth . It tries to criticize the lustful sexual appetite of men and say that women are more than just bodies . They have souls and feelings and emotions . But this is a simple point and even by today's standards it's outdated itself - this was far more prescient back in the ' 50s and ' 60s when the original took place . Nowadays it seems redundant and smug . The ending is where it all falls apart - it was obviously reshot to be " happier " and you can even tell because Nicole Kidman's hair is completely different at the end of the movie , which implies she was brought back months later for the re-shoot . It's a horrible little film that is instantly forgettable and annoying .
Typical modern-day teen flick . . .	Ho-hum comedy / romance with the basics : kissing , sex , and relationships . Drew Barrymore plays a highschooler who has never been kissed ; she falls in love with her teacher and you can kind of guess the outcome early on . In light of recent teen films this isn't half bad , but when compared to more intelligent and witty teen films such as " Ferris Bueller's Day Off " . . . this just is below-average . stars - - John Ulmer
What's the point ?	I don't understand the point of this movie . " Terms of Endearment " already did all this - and it was better . What's the point of bringing Shirley MacLaine back almost fifteen years later ? The original audience of the first film are much older by then and younger girls don't give a damn because they weren't around when the original was released . Do you see a point ? Neither do I . Perhaps that's why it flopped when it came out . MacLaine returns to her role and basically this movie is just her life and we get an update on how she's living . Juliette Lewis and Bill Paxton get little to do - Lewis is annoying as usual and frankly I wouldn't mind if she just stopped acting permanently tomorrow . The best thing about this film has to be Jack's cameo appearance as Garrett . It almost saves a failing movie - but once he leaves it all falls apart again .
The best parts are on the trailer , and the trailer was poor .	I didn't think this looked very promising from the trailers I saw , but it had the vocal talents of Robert De Niro , Angelina Jolie , Will Smith , and Martin Scorsese , so I figured it had to be pretty good , right ? Surely they all saw something in the material ? Perhaps Jack Black would be funny as the cowardly shark ? Nope . It's just poor animation in a poor film with poor humor and so-so vocal talents . First of all Will Smith is too self-aware . He seems to " know " he's providing his vocal talents so everything is sickeningly over-the-top and staged . De Niro's good but rarely in the film to be honest . Jolie is OK , Scorsese and Black are pretty funny and Zellweger seems to be most at ease with voice recording . Whereas the animation in " Shrek " was rather good ( in a purposely fake way ) the animation in " Shark Tale " is sloppy and disappointing . Also , I hate to sound racist but this really just seems like a version of " Finding Nemo " targeted towards the African-American demographic . Oscar the Fish ( Smith ) and his grandfather ( complete with a stereotypical afro ) run a " wash " and so we get a soundtrack with songs like " Car Wash . " How original . The humor isn't consistently funny , there are a few good gags but they've all been done before ( such as Katie Couric being replaced with Katie " Current " - didn't they do this in " Shrek 2 " with another news reporter ? ? ) . The fact that all the ads boast FROM THE CREATORS OF SHREK ! says something for the quality of this film . It relies upon the reputation of its big brother for success . " Shrek " walked the thin line of brilliant satire and muddled adult animation . ( I . e . adult-oriented jokes . ) " Shark Tale " seems to stray from the path and somewhere along the way becomes _ too _ adult in nature , creating a rather uncomfortable undercurrent dealing with murder and Mafia and violence and even sex , depending on how far you want to take the implications of the sensuous , seductive fish voiced by Jolie . I'm not going to say it's a bad film because it's adult . I'm just saying that's one of its fault . Overall , it's just not very interesting , funny , well-acted or impressive , in terms of both animation and story . I wasn't disappointed as I didn't expect very much . I'm hoping Dreamworks stops making animated CGI films - they've proved countless times with projects such as " Ice Age " and the overrated ( albeit enjoyable ) " Shrek " that Pixar is far superior . I really loved " Shrek 2 " ( more so than the original - by a long shot ) and that gave me some hope in this project , but after seeing it I felt assured that the best parts were included on the trailer - and since the trailer was rather unimpressive to begin with , that just goes to show how mediocre this film really is . A milestone : the first CGI film to gain a majority of negative reviews from critics nationwide .
Lame .	This is a lame comedy about a hit-man ( Bruce Willis ) who buddy-buddies with his next-door neighbor , a dentist ( Chandler ) , to predictable results . It has a few brief inspired moments , but they're far apart and even then don't deliver all they should . It borrows its style from " There's Something About Mary " ( and at least it's got an R-rating ) but isn't as funny . The acting is OK . Willis is basically on cruise control doing his typical steely-blue-eyes glare while Perry is the put-upon Gen X loser who says the words " like " and " umm " a lot and talks like the cast of " Clueless . " He's basically Chandler again , only there's no Joey to bounce the jokes off of . The script must have gone like this : BRUCE WILLIS stares a lot . BRUCE WILLIS : Hi , I'm a hit-man let's be friends . MATTHEW PERRY : Could I BE any more uncomfortable and put-upon ? BRUCE WILLIS stares at Matthew Perry some more . The End . I guess it made a bit of a splash when it came out because a sequel was released a couple years later - fortunately it flopped and we won't have to endure " The Whole Eleven Yards and Six Inches " any time soon . .
I can't believe I haven't commented on this yet !	I could have sworn I already wrote a review for " Hook , " but glancing at my review archive just now , I realized I hadn't - what a shock ! I've seen it so many times over the years . . . and each time it grows worse and worse . ( But in a good way , if that makes any sense . ) " Hook " is a terrible film , yes . But in some ways , it's also very good . The ideas that surface are unique - what if Peter Pan grew up ? What if he forgot who he was ? What if , what if , what if . . . ? The movie's stumbling block is Spielberg . This represents his best and worst - it's imaginative ( the good ) but way too bright , over-the-top and exuberant ( the bad ) . Spielberg's liberal impact on the material is always present - he represents the Lost Boys as a pack of minority kids , who ride skateboards and look like they just stepped out of Stereotypical Ghetto Number One . The movie's flashy coloring and vibrant overtones bring to mind his older failures such as " 1941 " - similarly " Hook " is a film that , despite its faults , remains somewhat interesting . The second huge slip-up is casting Julia Roberts as Tinkerbell . Meg Ryan was originally considered for the role and she would have been about a million times better . Roberts is annoying and gives one of the worst performances of her career ( which is saying quite a lot ) ; Ryan's acting skills aren't too great either ( take a look at " The Doors " ) but when she sticks to the right roles she's always great . This would have been one of her perfect roles . I could sit here and criticize this film to all ends but at the end of the day I always find just as much to like . Robin Williams is suitable as Peter and Dustin Hoffman absolutely steals the show as Hook - he delivers the best screen persona of Hook to ever reach the big screen , far surpassing Jason Isaacs in the 2003 J . M . Barrie version in particular . ( I think Isaacs is a great villain in cinema and he was given such little to do as Hook . ) The co-stars are all talented - British veterans like Maggie Smith add class - and the film's on-location shooting in London gives it an authentic feel . Overall I'm giving it a five-star ( out of ten ) rating because I don't really " like " the movie . But when it's on , I usually watch it . I used to own the VHS tape . I think some of the ideas are really clever and the performances are great . It's a shame about Spielberg and his wacky taste for the absurd , but at the end of the day , that's what has helped " Hook " retain its status as a beloved failure over the years - this is the movie everyone loves to hate .
I didn't like it	Someone had highly recommended " Equilibrium " to me , claiming it was better than " The Matrix " and a forgotten film that slipped under the radar in 2002 . Seeing how I never really bought into the whole " Matrix " craze , I figured this might be the more intelligent and unpretentious stylized action film I was looking for . Well , I was wrong . The movie opens in the future . A bunch of guys are tracking down criminals who have stolen the Mona Lisa . At first , we think they're trying to save the painting . Then we find out that they are actually trying to take it away so they can burn it . In the future , all art and other things associated with feelings , senses , creativity and emotions are banned . Humans take small pills that restrict that from feeling any emotions whatsoever . One of the law enforcement officers ( Christian Bale ) decides to stop taking his pill after being convinced not to . He realizes what he's been missing out on , but is afraid the others will find out so he has to keep his cool . Unfortunately a conscience prohibits him from ruthlessly murdering people anymore . Soon other agents realize what has happened and he is put on the next hit list . " Equilibrium " is all style , no substance . It has a really promising plot , but it doesn't go anywhere with it . It's not based around paranoia and fear ; it's based around how much butt you can kick , and how well you can kick it . I admire the effort . The director on the DVD commentary track seems really into his material and loves the movie . He says he's really sad it was misunderstood on release ( the critics lambasted it , helping it die a quick death at the box office ) . However , I have to admit I can see where the critics were coming from . The fight scenes are pretty cool but they aren't entertaining after a while ; the ending in particular didn't emotionally affect me in any way , and watching loads of people getting slaughtered loses its novelty after a while . I liked the fact that the whole hero-vs . - villain fight was about untypical as you can get ( I won't ruin it , but suffice to say , it wasn't what I was expecting ) . But other than that , the movie isn't that good .
A rather good story reminiscent of " Little Big Man , " although not quite as good . . .	After watching " Little Big Man " and " The Last Samurai " within a week of each other , it seems as though they are both very similar . A man is taken in by another culture , then freed and decides to defend them out of his own free will . Both films bash Custer , too . Edward D . Zwick , the man behind " Glory " and " Legends of the Fall " , directs the latter of the two before mentioned films . Here he creates a good - - although long - - portrait of one man who joined a war not many people know about . It's not a great movie , but it's certainly a good one . The hero is played by Tom Cruise . His name is Nathan Algren , and he is a Civil War hero who is paid to read lines on stage in the year 1876 , fascinating onlookers with his knowledge and tales of the war - - when he's not drunk , that is . When his performance is noticed by Sgt . Zebulah Grant ( Billy Connolly ) , he is offered a job to travel to Japan and train hundreds of soldiers in the art of war . Why ? Because the emperor of the country wants to modernize Japan , but a band of Samurai are rebelling . They need to be fought , but Japan's soldiers have no knowledge of modern weapons . Nathan does . During a battle between the Samurai and Nathan's battle , he shows great courage and honor and is taken hostage by the Samurai , falling under the care of Taka ( Koyuki ) , whose husband was killed by Nathan in a bloody showdown . The Samurai leader , Katsumoto ( Ken Watanabe ) , is impressed by Nathan and their " good conversations , " and decides to train him in the way of the Samurai . Nathan falls in love ( one of the biggest clichés of film history ) with Taka , although the romance never goes over the top , which was a pleasant relief . But when Col . Benjamin Bagly ( Tony Goldwyn ) leads an army of Japanese into battle against the Samurai , Nathan has to ask himself whom he will fight for . The answer is somewhat predictable by any standard , and the ending is somewhat ridiculous , but it's a good film and certainly one worth seeing if you enjoy war films . I've never been impressed by Tom Cruise , mainly because I've never seen him stretch his roles . " Rain Man " is one of my favorite performances , but Cruise plays Cruise . In " The Firm , " Cruise plays Cruise . In " Top Gun , " Cruise plays Cruise . And now , in " The Last Samurai , " Cruise once again plays Cruise . But at least he manages to do more than a few different facial expressions in this - - he's now added angry and sad to his list . In fact , Cruise does quite well here . The thing is , he has yet to impress me by playing someone . . . different . When someone can play an entirely different person ( like Hoffman in " Rain Man " ) and convince me that they are no longer that familiar actor , it's always a great sign . I wish Cruise would try a more daring film role for once . Tony Goldwyn , who has always played good villains , is perfect here - - really annoying with an evil-like voice that's actually just bland . It gets on your nerves , which is a good thing . If he had played the hero , I would have left the theater . ( Or come pretty close to doing that . I've never left a theater , and I never plan to . ) Ken Watanabe , who is receiving generous acclaim for his role , is pretty good - - although I wouldn't say that his performance is deserving of an Oscar . Zwick's downfall here is that he sometimes tries a bit too hard . He had tried to turn " The Last Samurai " into both a political message and a rousing epic , but when compared to something such as " Braveheart , " it fails miserably . I didn't feel very much for Cruise's character here . And there are too many unneeded scenes that should have been left on the cutting room floor . And while I'm picking on the movie , another thing I noticed is that the dialogue is sometimes corny and rather dumb . " Tell me how he died , " an emperor asks Nathan . " I'll tell you how he lived , " Nathan replies . Seriously , it's just a bit too heavy on the cornball moments sometimes . And are we supposed to believe that Nathan would really survive a Samurai attack , then a battle against an army of Japanese soldiers with guns and cannons , left to be THE last man on the battlefield ( hence the title ) ? But the battle scenes are , for the most part , quite exhilarating ; the acting is very good ( although I still don't think Cruise has stretched very far from his other roles ) , and the direction fine . The two factors that reduced this from a great rating to a very good one are the length and sometimes quite silly dialogue . If you can stomach those two things , check out " The Last Samurai . " stars . - John Ulmer
Ha . Ha ha . Ha .	Rhea Perlman plays a character named Ms . Beezlebub . Get it ? If you don't , then you won't appreciate this made-for-TV Disney movie about a famous hockey player ( Matthew Lawrence , the kid who said " Why don't I get Indian burns ? " in " Planes , Trains and Automobiles ) who sells his soul to a demon played by the funny Will Friedle ( " Boy Meets World " ) . Adequate television viewing fueled by Friedle's performance ; otherwise , this is one for the tots .
Batman Temporarily . . .	It's sad to see a series wither away . First there was " Batman , " a fun film with a good director at the helm who portrayed Gotham City with just the right tone of darkness , ignoring the camp qualities of the aptly named television show of the 1960s that starred Adam West , and had also betrayed the comic's tone to go for full-out laughs . Then there came " Batman Returns , " an over-the-top sequel that had too many quirky qualities and dark traits for my own personal enjoyment . Then Michael Keaton and Tim Burton left the series so that Val Kilmer and Joel Schumacher could step in ( Burton produced the third film but ignored the fourth altogether ; WB is smart , the new Special Edition DVDs coming out exclude " Batman and Robin , " too ) . This essentially marked the downfall of a series many refer to as one of the most disappointing and " in-between " of all time . Val Kilmer is a good Batman , and I think everyone has to admit this . He is arguably the best Batman of them all - - as much as I like Michael Keaton as an actor , many people were dissatisfied with his portrayal of Bruce Wayne on the whole , and George Clooney was just George Clooney in the fourth film . Kilmer displays a sort of repressed anger and rage and hatred for crime that is vital to the Batman character in the first place . He looks as though his mind is heavy and his soul depressed with the mess of the world - - too bad the material can't support the depths of Bruce Wayne in this one . After Two-Face ( Tommy Lee Jones ) emerges from the underground of Gotham City and threatens peace in his own extravagant way , Bruce Wayne ( Kilmer ) puts on his cape and defends his beloved city - - much to the chagrin of a new villain , The Riddler ( Jim Carrey ) , who teams up with Two-Face and decides to hatch an elaborate plan to brainwash America using small TV boxes . ( Symbolism ? A bad matter for a film like " Batman Forever " to try and tackle . ) Meanwhile , Dr . Chase Meridian ( Nicole Kidman ) tries to unearth the mystery of Batman , and a recently orphaned acrobat named Dick ( Chris O'Donnell ) comes to live with Bruce and vows to seek vengeance against his family's murderer : Two-Face . This is , as far as I know , pretty close to the comic books - - but the outcome is at times quite disastrous . Chris O'Donnell , as Robin , is the film's weak link in terms of acting - - he brings nothing memorable to his character and merely stumbles through the movie like a walking plank made of wood . His family of acrobats , clothed with the same design of Robin from the cult TV series , takes a plummet a few stories up after trying to save the day . He gets mad . But O'Donnell is too smarmy and smart-alecky to like . Please , get rid of this guy . Thanks to Joel Schumacher , this stands as one of the wackiest films of all time . I looked forward to it quite enthusiastically back in 1995 , when the top-notch cast and extreme word-of-mouth seemed to hype up the film to a maximum extreme . The result was discouraging , and to this day the entire circus sequence is ingrained in my memory as one of the most OTT of all time . In some respects this could be called one of the worst films of all time . It's over-the-top , ridiculously extravagant and horribly directed by Schumacher - - whose films are hit ( " Falling Down , " " Phone Booth " ) or miss ( his second " Batman " movie ) . Here he's somewhere in between . The acting by Kilmer , Lee Jones , Kidman , and even Carrey is fine . The movie itself is just bad - - and that's where it fails . But in terms of entertainment , this is easier to digest than the second movie . I prefer it , despite its flaws . And it isn't half as bad as " Batman and Robin . " Trivia note : Michael Keaton was originally attached to this project with Rene Russo as his love interest . However , after meeting Schumacher and disagreeing with his vision for the series , he left the project and Russo was deemed " too old " for Kilmer .
Grrrrovy fun baby , yeah !

Cameos . Humor . Good movie . What more could you ask for , baby ? starsJOHN ULMER
Interestingly eccentric blend of horror , period piece and martial arts - but it loses a lot of steam towards the end	The Beast of Gevaudan roamed the region for three years in the mid-18th century , killing 80 - 100 people in this time range and prompting the king to call upon numerous hunters to track the beast and kill it . To this day , the Beast is an unsolved mystery . Some claim it was a deranged wolf with a blood lust ( since it rarely ate its victims and would instead crush their skulls with its jaw ) , while others believe it was an extinct species of hyena . Others believe the beast has been exaggerated over the years and it could have merely been an escaped lion . Then there are those who believe it was a trained creature working with a human counterpart - an early serial killer using an animal to help him kill . The movie is interesting because , like Mark Pellington's " The Mothman Prophecies , " it takes an engaging urban legend and instead of trying to find any direct answers or make it a film entirely _ about _ the creature itself , it uses the backdrop as a means to explore other elements . " Le pacte des loups " ( The Brotherhood of the Wolf ) takes the story of the Beast of Gevaudan and twists it around quite a bit . Some of it works well - the mix of period piece and action movie is a nice blend - but particularly towards the end , once it turns into an unbelievable Jet Li-style martial arts flick , it goes down an awkward path and ruins a lot of what it has already established . It's the one thing that pushes the genre-bender over the edge and it really does feel too bogged down by that point . Also , the revelations during the finale - involving the beast and the plot behind its motivations - are fairly weak . However , the setup is fine , and the movie is an interesting oddity : a weird little mix of genres that offers a bit for everyone , even if its ending is a let-down .
Good but certainly not without its flaws	" Ghost World " is a funny comedy from Terry Zwigoff about two teenaged girls in a small middle-America town and their unique outlook on life . Scarlett Johansson and Thora Birch are the leads , but Birch in particular is a stand-out and co-star Steve Buscemi ( " Fargo " ) is wonderful as always and a real scene-stealer . Unfortunately the film isn't quite as witty as I had hoped , at least not evenly . In particular it falters in the mid-section and many sequences could have been altogether cut from the finished product without harming its effect Ã¢â ? ¬ " running at about 120 minutes this is certainly a heavy " comedy " ! I remember Danny DeVito once said a comedian has failed if he makes a film longer than 90 minutes ( or something to this effect ) and I totally understand what he means Ã¢â ? ¬ " many comedies that are two hours long suffer from overlong scenes . " Ghost World " is a bit of a drama , though , so I guess I can understand it being long Ã¢â ? ¬ " but that doesn't excuse the fact that it doesn't need to be as long as it is ! Overall this movie amused me and I enjoyed a number of the sequences but it really doesn't feel like an independent production Ã¢â ? ¬ " more like a mainstream Hollywood movie trying to hide underneath the false image of an indie flick . Buscemi's directorial debut , " Trees Lounge , " is a much better exploitation of suburban life and depression and relationships between middle-aged men and teenaged girls Ã¢â ? ¬ " it's cleverer , sharper and more memorable . And if you enjoy " Ghost World " I can also heartily recommend some other similar independent films that really _ are _ independent . Something about this film gave me the feeling it wasn't as small and low-budget as it wants us to think it is . That said , it is very good , just not " great " and certainly not without its flaws .
Entertaining sex comedy - it is what it is . Plus , take in Johnny Depp before he was famous .	I knew nothing of this film before I saw it . It was a free " On Demand " film from Comcast . I didn't even know Johnny Depp was in it . I thought the plot description ( which was vague ) sounded like every other girl-crazy sex comedy released after " Animal House , " and I got what I expected . To be fair this is entertaining . No , it's not a great movie . It's not very well made . It's crude . It's sexist . It's all about sex . But that's exactly what it's supposed to be . Graded by the standards of its genre , it works . It's about two kids ( one of whom is played by Johnny Depp ) who gain access to a private resort in the middle of the Caribbean ( presumably ) . There's no backdrop . We don't even know how they got in to the resort . And they look about 16 , so it's odd to see them going after women in their 30s and 40s ( sometimes succeeding ) . Depp wasn't famous yet ( correct me if I'm wrong but this was his first starring role in a film to speak of ? ) and this certainly didn't help boost his career ( he took a considerably smaller role in Oliver Stone's " Platoon " the year after ) but he displays charisma and good charm that would carry on into his later movies . The film's take-it-as-it-is attitude makes it entertaining . It's a simple sex comedy with crude laughs and running gags , a lot of which aren't very funny , a few of which are , almost all of which are at the least amusing . Worth catching if you see it on cable some time .
Just something to help pass the time - nothing special , but much better than " Godsend . "	" Hide and Seek " is yet another supposed psychological thriller that deals with something I can't mention , since doing so would ruin the end of the film ( not that you won't have guessed the ending waaay ahead of time ) . Most surprising of all is that the finale has become such a cliché in Hollywood that they're no longer delivering the " shock " endings with finesse ? I found the final revelation in " Hide and Seek " rather lackluster . No , seriously , the movie isn't half bad ? at least not as bad as it could easily have been . Sure , there are some logical gaps . The ending goes on far too long , a few loose threads are left dangling , etc . But the acting is good , the direction is apt and the dialogue isn't as terrible as I had expected . " Hide and Seek " is like the good version of last year's " Godsend . " Neither are excellent films , but one of them is below mediocre and the other is lukewarm and , at the least , entertaining . The other ? isn't . Robert De Niro isn't out to win any awards , but he delivers a fine and believable performance ( save the last fifteen minutes ) as a concerned parent whose troubled pre-teen daughter ( Dakota Fanning ) is taking a liking to violent drawings and sick mind games after her mother commits suicide in the opening scenes of the film . De Niro moves with his daughter to the countryside , out of the big city , where he tries to provide her a " normal life . " Unfortunately in her new home she makes friends with " Charlie , " an imaginary pal who might not actually be so imaginary after all . De Niro isn't worried until people start dying and cops are banging on his door asking questions about missing people . Windows mysteriously open by themselves , doors are left ajar , and his daughter begins to play hide and seek with her best friend Charlie , who doesn't like to be discussed about with other humans . " Hide and Seek " is hardly offensive and it's instantly forgettable . It's intended as a piece of entertainment , nothing more and nothing less . No , it's not De Niro's best performance but he isn't on auto pilot , either ? I thought he was better here than he has been in some time and his interaction with Fanning ( one of the all-time best child actors ) is convincing , to say the least . The dialogue is pretty realistic most of the time ( it's a movie that doesn't shy away from revealing the dark sides of parenting ) and the direction isn't as hackneyed as " Godsend . " Overall " Hide and Seek " is nothing special , but it's a great deal better than " Godsend " and nothing particularly substantial ? just something to help pass a couple hours when you've got nothing better to do .
A Surprisingly Good Car Flick . . .	With other films like " The Fast and the Furious " coming out around the same time " Gone in Sixty Seconds " did , I expected " Sixty Seconds " to be another forgettable car chase movie hyped up on testosterone . I was wrong . " Gone in Sixty Seconds " turned out to be a surprisingly good car flick with a good car chase at the end . I definitely recommend it - - especially if you're sick of other car film like " The Fast and the Furious , " which are just adrenaline pumped films with no real car chases worth remembering . . . It's not a " great " action film , but it's good , and in my opinion the best car film of 2000 when compared to " Furious " . Nicolas Cage , Angelina Jolie and Robert Duvall star . stars - - John Ulmer
A savage statement on how possessors become the possessed , or merely another stupid horror-thriller ? You decide .	This film , based on a novel by Stephen King , focuses on a nerdy teenage boy in high school who comes into possession of a bright red 1958 Plymouth Fury - a car which , at first , he is merely impressed by , but which soon begins to overtake every aspect of his life , ultimately making itself the owner of him and altering his personality into that of an arrogant , mean-spirited jerk . The message isn't too subtle - it's a comment on how humans often become possessed by their possessions . We love our cars , or our entertainment systems , or any aspect of our lives , and soon they begin to control us . But I'm not sure it totally works . The message isn't subtle , as I mentioned above - it's just a bit too obvious and direct . And although it has strong moments , a good deal of the material simply turns into standard horror-thriller moments - anything you'd find in another King novel . King really likes the idea of evil cars for some reason - he went on to write " From a Buick 8 " later on in his career . You know you've got some type of obsession ( or you're running out of ideas ) when you write two separate novels about killer cars . But despite its lack of subtlety , I found this to be an entertaining enough movie . Although it caters towards the typical shocker / jump moments all horror films from the ' 80s had , it's also quite original as far as far as concepts go . Until " From a Buick 8 " is made into a movie , it's probably the only film you're going to find where an evil , demonic car tries to kill someone .
Rodney's fans will like it	This was really the first true Rodney Dangerfield vehicle . It was clearly written with Rodney in mind , or at least edited to fit him after he signed on . As a result , a lot of scenes go nowhere and seem completely random - they're just showcases for some of that famous Rodney Humor . If another actor were cast in the role , the movie would be terrible because the flaws would be outstanding . But when it's Rodney , it all seems to fall into place . The plot involves Rodney's mother-in-law dying and leaving him her fortunes in her will - but only if he cleans up his act first . He has to stop smoking , drinking , doing drugs , and must begin eating healthier . Of course , this can't hold up an entire movie , so the first 35 minutes or so has nothing to do with the rest of the plot . It shows Rodney at home , it shows him hanging out with Joe Pesci , gambling , going to a strip club , etc . Then there is a really bizarre subplot involving his daughter's wedding that contains one long , rambling scene ( without Rodney , surprisingly ) that goes nowhere . However , Rodney fans will find his typical humor here to enjoy . It may not be as coherent as " Back to School " but it is still a fine showcase for his comedic talents and reveals why Rodney Dangerfield was one of the best comedians of all-time , regardless of how bad the movies he starred in usually were .
A good premise , but the overall film is just so-so . . .	John ( Ben Chaplin ) is a hapless bachelor in St . Albans , looking for love in all the wrong places . So he goes online and orders a Russian mail-order bride . She arrives in the form of Nicole Kidman . Although her background is questionable and her English is fragmented , she's great in bed , so he has no complaints . However when her " cousins " appear at his door a whole new world of deception and violence opens up for John , pulling him deeper and deeper under . The premise for the film is fairly good , but the overall execution is just so-so . Nicole Kidman gives a really good performance ( worthy of a better film ) but Ben Chaplin is just OK . He slaps her around a bit , which is about as daring as his character manages to be . Anyone could play the role , so he's kind of stuck in a rut . The movie is grungy , dark and feels independent - it's hard to imagine Hollywood royalty Nicole Kidman signing onto it , but she is really the reason this film remains interesting and engaging . Without her , I don't think I would have bothered to sit through all of it .
Beautifully haunting and wonderfully bizarre , but its ambitions weigh it down , along with its clinical and distant approach to the characters	Visually stimulating but frustratingly disconnected from its viewers , The Fountain establishes director Darren Aronofsky as one of our most daring and adventurous directors ? but his ambitions are ultimately what cause The Fountain to sink beneath its own heavy-handed pretensions . Aronofsky has a way of making the most everyday events thrilling and beautiful , but his clinical approach to the characters of the film ? portrayed by Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz ? creates a cold distance . A film such as this requires us to invest our emotions in the characters , which is impossible to do when they are so haphazardly presented . While the art sequences are mesmerizing , every time Aronofsky spends time focusing on his characters the movie hits a brick wall and becomes incredibly tiresome . The fragmented story structure certainly doesn't help much in this regard . While it is no doubt an excuse for some awe-inspiring visual creations , every time Aronofsky cuts to another storyline more distance is drawn between the audience and the characters in the movie . The plot , if you can follow this , involves a driven doctor ( Jackman ) trying to develop a cure for death . He claims it is just a disease , like anything else , and that he will be the one to give humans infinite life . He is not driven by greed ? his wife ( Weisz ) is dying of cancer and so he feels obligated to deliver her a cure . Meanwhile , the film veers off onto two different paths ? one involving a Spanish conquistador and his quest for the Fountain of Youth , the other about the doctor from the first storyline ( I think ? ) being trapped in a bubble in outer space with a dying tree ( which his wife is apart of because it grew from her corpse ? yes , honestly ) and his struggle to ? umm ? preserve the tree and himself so they can live together forever . The film's soundtrack , composed by Clint Mansell ( Requiem for a Dream ) , is perhaps the highlight of the entire picture . Mansell is quickly establishing a name for himself as one of Hollywood's greatest composers . And certainly the movie will wow audiences looking for something pretty . But it is not a very enjoyable experience , for the most part , and the scenes involving human conflict dragged on seemingly forever . And so as an art-house picture this is wonderfully bizarre , beautifully haunting and utterly captivating ; I just wish Aronofsky had chosen a film that did not require more emotional involvement than he was willing to develop .
What happened , Ben ?	I think Ben Stiller is usually quite funny , especially in Meet the Parents ( update as of : his shtick is now growing weary ) , but Zoolander is one of his worst . There are few funny moments that I actually laughed at . Even though Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller are best buds and frequently work together in films , it didn't help the rest of the movie at all . The female love interest of Derek Zoolander lacked charisma , and though Ben's real life dad Jerry Stiller ( Seinfeld ) was in this , he couldn't save it either . Zoolander is a huge misfire because it tries to target a specific age group and , I think , fails mostly due to the fact that it's not nearly as funny as it thinks it is . Sure , it has a few funny cameos from the likes of Billy Zane , David Duchovny and Will Ferrell , and there are a few funny one-liners including " How are the children supposed to learn to read if they can't even fit inside the building ? " , but if you've already seen the trailer . . . you've seen the best bits .
Pretty amusing and entertaining . . . .	Amusing and entertaining big-screen adaptation of the cult Saturday morning cartoon show featuring a band of school kids whose recesses seem to last hours and hours . A TV show entirely based around school recess may seem silly , but the movie is just as strangely entertaining as the show . James Woods and Andrew Lawrence provide voice talents .
Decent black comedy	I hesitate to call " Novocaine " a film noir , for those knowledgeable cinema buffs out there may harass me and tell me film noir is usually set in the forties , and so on and so forth . But the core of film noir is really the essential idea of the Everyman thrust into incomprehensible situations , not aware of what is happening , why , or how to stop it . Film noirs usually show our hero caught up in framed murder . In " Novocaine , " a dentist is thrust into a world of lies , deceit , sex , drugs , and murder . And if that doesn't tickle your fear , then maybe the fact that the dentist is Steve Martin will . Film noirs are a tricky thing to make correctly . They can fail very easily , such as the incredibly disappointing " D . O . A . " They can stumble , mess up . When the rare " Who Framed Roger Rabbit ? " comes along , it is time to rejoice . I must admit that when I went to see " Novocaine " with Steve Martin , I did not expect very much . I had already heard bad news about it , seen little previews for it , and generally expected it to be a bad movie . Steve Martin in a film noir about a funny dentist ? Fortunately , I instantly realized I had made a mistake . Our tale begins with Dr . Frank Sangster , a mild-mannered dentist ( isn't that how it always is in film noirs ? ) with a fiancé / co-worker , Jean ( Laura Dern ) , and a generally nice , peaceful little world . But that world is shaken when a sleazy , lusty woman named Susan Ivey ( Helena Bonham Carter ) walks through the doors . She wants Novocaine , but Frank doesn't know this . After a night of passion in the dentist's chair , Frank agrees to give her Novocaine for pain she is having . But the next day , when he thinks he may have gotten away with everything , he finds out that Susan has increased the amount on the prescription he gave her from about 1 to 100 , or something like that . Soon Frank is being checked out by the Three-Letter Government Corporations , and , unable to come up with excuses for the missing Novocaine , tries to find Susan and confront her about it . Before long he is caught up in a web of deceit , murder , perjury , all the stuff I said before . " Novocaine " is a sweet ball of darkness , laughs and film noir . It numbs you , leaving you breathless . It is as if the film itself is " Novocaine . " It isn't a terrific comedy , or a terrific film noir , but it is a heck of a lot better than you have probably been led to believe . Steve Martin is about the last person you'd expect to see in a film like this , but my favorite comedian pulls it off . His character , Frank , has no idea what is going on . He isn't experienced in the world of greed , lust and so on and so forth like Susan is - - he is new to it , stumbling forward unsure of where to go next . As situations catch up with him , he runs farther , searching the darkness , trying to find answers . This is a fun movie to watch , the kind of movie I've been looking for . The beginning credits , which show X-rays of the human mouth , set the tone for the film - - it is a dark movie , and leaves you feeling dirty throughout . It is the type of movie where you want to sit back , shake your head and make ticking sounds with your mouth . It frustrates you , it leads the characters into wrong decision , and you want to yell at the screen to stop them from doing what they're doing . But when the dirty feeling of the film kicks in , the small laughs along the way provide a balance to the darkness . " Novocaine " is a very well-done film noir . When the credits start rolling , you will feel surges of anger , frustration , laughter and sadness , and then the numbness will kick in on the ride home , and you'll feel like you've just been given a dose of Novocaine .
Read the book . . .	The first Jurassic Park was very good , as was the book , and while THE LOST WORLD novel isn't as good as the first , the film's even farther off . Jeff Goldblum's character has done a complete 180 degree turn into some " Know it all preacher . " I hate the scene where he says something like " Ooh , yeah , that's how it all starts-then there's screaming and yelling and running . " He sounds incredibly stupid when he's saying it , and his character in this film is just plain annoying . I love the first and third film , and despite the sickening rumors of Ian Malcolm coming back for film 4 , I hop that Grant ( Sam Neill ) comes back for more . I'm hoping unless the script is excellent , they don't make another stupid film to end the series like The Lost World . Let's hop for something like film 1 or 3 ( hearing rumors of film 5 too . I guess people love the dinos-I know I do ) . I give the Lost World stars for having some good dinosaur sequences-other than that it's a pass . JOHN ULMER
Disappointing , But Still Worth Seeing . . .	" Gremlins " ( 1984 ) is one of my favorite comedies . It is so delightfully comical and campy , like a B horror movie , yet delightfully witty and scary . The sequel , " Gremlins 2 , " goes for more laughs than anything else , and comes off simply as an average , one-or-two-time-viewable summer flick . Billy ( Zach Galligan ) has since moved out of town , along with fiancée Phoebe Cates . They are now in New York City , working at Clamp Industries , headed by Clamp , a spoof on multiple political figures . Anywho . At his new office , Billy finds Gizmo , who has wondered from his home after Mr . Myagi - err , the Chinese man - died in the beginning of the film . He was picked up by some scientists , brought to Clamp , and then escaped to Billy's office , coincidentally . Well , Billy leaves him there for Cates to pick him up later . Unfortunately , Gizmo gets wet , and pretty soon a new breed of Gremlins have taken over the building , including a speaking Gremlin named " Brain . " " Gremlins 2 " is in no way as clever , fun , or humorous as the original . What is so ironic is that this sequel was supposed to go strictly for laughs , unlike the original , but I didn't laugh half as many times as I did the first time around while watching " Gremlins . " The jokes are not exactly re-hashed , but they are very dull . Yes , sometimes there are some big laughs , but I really expected more . Zach Galligan seems a little more full of himself in this sequel . Perhaps after the original he found success and figured he was a big shot . Ironically , he is now voicing computer games , and according to his attitude and comments on the DVD commentary with Joe Dante and cast , he seems to still think a lot of himself . Phoebe Cates is more beautiful in this film . She just looked average in the first , but something about her haircut matching her face in this film makes her look cute . Dick Miller , my favorite character - apart from Stripe - from the first film , returns , saying he was only injured by the snow plow . A cheap way of bringing back a character , yes . But I'm glad he's in it - he has more screen time in this film , and that's one good element of the movie . Director Joe Dante obviously had fun making this sequel , but it's nowhere near as good as the original . I'd probably be blaming the director of this film for how mediocre it is , but I can't muster up enough words to accuse Joe Dante , who made the original , that he is a bad director - the first film was excellent . But part of film critique is that you MUST criticize certain aspects of a lousy film , and while " Gremlins 2 " was in no way a LOUSY movie , it wasn't exactly a winner . Instead of putting thought into this absent-minded sequel , it seems the filmmakers single-handedly cashed in on the original's solid success . Instead of making something highly intelligent and thoughtful , " Gremlins 2 " comes out as a half-baked , summer sequel , whereas it could have been remembered as something more . " Gremlins 2 " is the kind of movie everyone is talking about before seeing it , and no one is talking about the next day . No , it's not horrible , and it's definitely worth seeing - especially if you're a fan of the original - but it's a major blow to the superior original .
This was a different show	I used to watch reruns of this TV show because I enjoyed " A Goofy Movie , " of which this is a spin-off . Farmer returns to the voice of Goofy and essentially this show was just about him and his son Max ( who was also in " A Goofy Movie " ) . The humor is not going to appeal to adults as much as children , although there are occasionally pop-culture references that older viewers will pick up on . There were also some celebrity cameos such as Jimmy Stewart and younger viewers most certainly would not recognize his voice . Overall if you enjoyed " A Goofy Movie " it is likely that you will like this show , also - but it is not as good or fresh as the film .
Lacks a point .	Kevin Smith isn't typically known for mature work ? the majority of his films are funny , but crude . " Chasing Amy , " his follow-up to the 1995 box office failure " Mallrats , " is certainly the most adult film he has made , in terms of general context . Overall , however , I was left with mixed feelings . Holden ( Ben Affleck ) is the co-creator of a popular comic strip named " Bluntman and Chronic . " One day at a New York City Comicon Convention , a friend of Holden's introduces him to Alyssa ( Joey Lauren Adams ) , a free-spirited , adventurous girl whom Holden instantly takes a liking to . As they spend more time together , Holden finds himself falling in love . But there's just one problem : Alyssa is a lesbian . Holden's best friend and co-writer / artist , Banky ( Jason Lee ) , resents Alyssa ? both because he is homophobic and afraid of losing Holden . He doesn't trust Alyssa , and digs up dirt on her that extends into her high school days , when , apparently , she was not just into chicks . " Chasing Amy " has moments of rare greatness ? the dialogue , first of all , is excellent . So is the acting . Joey Lauren Adams has been severely underused since " Chasing Amy , " starring in undeveloped romantic roles in comedies such as " Big Daddy . " Her character Alyssa in Smith's film is three-dimensional , and her outburst towards the end of the picture is heartfelt and honest . Jason Lee is hilarious in a very believable way ( never stretching Banky into a far-fetched comedic personality ) and even Ben Affleck manages to remain tolerable . ( Which is always unusual . ) I think the problem with " Chasing Amy " is that it simply tries too hard , and lacks a point . Smith attempted to prove to his critics that he was capable of making a realistic , sophisticated and complex motion picture and tackles some very , very touchy subjects in the process , without ever coming to any solid conclusion . Credit must be given where it is due ? Smith is an expert at snappy one-liners and good dialogue . But no matter how clever , insightful and emotionally developed Smith's everyday jargon may very well be , at heart he is still a philistine . One need only listen to five minutes of one of his DVD commentary tracks to realize this . That core immaturity doesn't translate well to the screen in a picture that wants to be taken as something more . It's like a child trying to imitate an adult ? the gestures might be there , but the experience and cultivation is not . Another major weakness of " Chasing Amy " is that it is too blunt , I think . Example ? It's heavily implied that Banky is a repressed closet homosexual . It makes sense , and a deleted scene from another of Smith's later films confirms it . But I felt it should never have been addressed at all in " Chasing Amy " ? great films imply , they don't stress . A character from " Chasing Amy " explains to Holden what we're all thinking ? maybe Banky has feelings for Holden that he isn't ready to acknowledge . This is too much . It's too clear , and not subtle enough . It should have been left up to the audience to use their own perceptions . By the time this " explanation " occurs in the movie , I had already assumed Banky was gay ; Smith's desire to put it into words seemed anti-climactic and ruined the speculation . That best sums up the entire film , really - - " Chasing Amy " has its good parts , but the finished product is messy and contradictory and just too damned wordy . It tries at every turn to be insightful , honest , mature and even epic . The problem with all this is that Smith lacks a point ? he wants to say there's nothing wrong with being gay , and love is love no matter whether you're male or female , but it's clear that deep inside he is a bit like Banky ? homophobic and immature . His decision to turn Alyssa into a " mistake , " a woman who has been fooled into lesbianism , who is " saved " by Holden , doesn't make sense . I'm not criticizing the film's motive ? if it had one , I'd judge it based on how well it elucidates it . My own point is that Smith doesn't have one ? he's wishy-washy , one moment preaching to his audience about the dangers of homophobia , the next moment turning his lesbian into the very stereotype all lesbians must hate : the woman who is afraid of men and deep down inside her heart is actually is attracted to them . I was left wondering what Smith was trying to get across to his audience . For what it's worth , my favorite scene from " Chasing Amy " is when Jay and Silent Bob ( Jason Mewes and Smith himself ) show up . Silent Bob's monologue is honest and tender without coming across as being too showy or gushy . Had the entire film matched this one scene , it would be a great deal better .
A very faithful adaptation of the book , but I wasn't overly impressed	I left " Narnia " feeling kind of cold . I loved the books as a child , and most specifically " The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe , " which I read numerous times when I was young . . . but no matter how faithful the adaptation is - story-wise - some elements don't fit into place . I think it's one of those books that is better off left as a book . The themes and actions that take place in C . S . Lewis ' Christian allegory do not translate well to the screen . I felt that something was off . The direction by Andrew Adamson ( " Shrek " ) is commendable , but the second half of the movie is very bright , the animation throughout is quite poor ( except for Aslan ) , and the final battle comes across as utterly silly . Also , by squeezing the book into a two-hour movie whilst still retaining the essence of the novel , Adamson's film lacks cohesion . It all happens too fast . The characters are rather thin and I felt as if some scenes were handled poorly . For example , when Edmund first meets the White Witch - - if you were a young child who had just stumbled into a world inside a wardrobe , then told by a queen you were going to be the king , don't you think it'd be hard to conceal your excitement ? Instead , Edmund returns into the real world , and the only hint we get that he's thinking about Narnia is when a very poor exposition scene occurs with Peter pointing out how Edmund is sulking about . The course of action in the film is poorly developed as well . One minute they're reluctant to fight , the next minute they're armored up . The problem is that with a two-hour film like this , it's hard to develop the characters . In a novel , it's easier - the general narratives of novels make us feel more attached to the characters . WATCHING them is much different - and it's hard to take their decision to join Narnia's battle against the White Witch very seriously at all . Also , maybe I was the only one who noticed that young Georgie Henley ( who plays Lucy ) was always smiling . Not just a happy smile , though . A wicked smile , like she's just played a trick on somebody and ready to savor the revenge . It's kind of creepy . When she cries at the end , it still looked like she was ready to stab someone in the back and break into a maniacal laugh . Am I being harsh ? Probably a bit too much , yes . It's just that coming from a child-at-heart who loved this particular book years ago , I feel the adaptation as a whole is simply mediocre . I felt disattached from the characters , I thought the animation was poor , some scenes were handled poorly , and the final battle was a joke . Overall , it's worth seeing if you like the book ( s ) . I was personally disappointed by the film , but it seems - judging from its IMDb rating - most people weren't . Hopefully the sequel will be better .
Overrated .	I hate the word " overrated " when it's used to describe anything in general ( particularly films ) , but it's the first thing that comes to mind when I think of " Traffic . " I've never been very impressed by Steven Soderbergh and this film continues my disappointment . It starts off brilliant - a rough , gritty , European-like art-house epic with filtered colors and beautiful cinematography . . . but soon it goes downhill . It runs out of steam - fast . The characters and all their many stories start to become dull and plodding ; I didn't really find myself caring one way or another about Michael Douglas and his daughter , played by Erika Christensen ( who had the honor of acting in the film " Swimf @ n " with resident IMDb spammer and self-promoter Monroe Mann , who claims to be " Oscar bound " ) . Catherine Zeta-Jones is simply unimpressive ( as always ) and I was only really interested in Don Cheadle and Benicio del Toro's characters ; they were not only the deepest but also most intriguing and well-acted . The plot - or whatever there is of it ( it just seems to be a few stories connected by the central theme of illegal drug trafficking ) is based on a European mini-series called " Traffik . " The miniseries is better . I didn't hate this , but I was disappointed and soon found it testing my patience . Clocking in at around three hours , I felt it tried too hard to be a big , powerful , Oscar-seeking epic and instead should have just focused more on developing a powerful story .
I was expecting a grand finale trilogy ending . A great closing of the back to the future movies . . . I expected wrong . . .	Before I get into everything let me say this . I don't hate this movie . I just thought it was a great disappointment to the rest of the trilogy . This movie's more like western mixed with comedy , then a back to the future movie . If you've read my comments on the first two back to the future movies , you can realize how much I loved them . The acting was superb , and the plot outlines and the script . . . It was wonderful . This movie I felt was just slapped together a bit at last moment . I was waiting for YEARS to see this movie , but my video store never had it . You see I had seen BTTF part2 on tv , before I saw no . 1 , and then when we rented out the original BTTF , it didn't ruin it , but . . . I knew what would happen , yet no . 2 had confused me greatly because I was a little kid , and I couldn't understand why two Michael J . Fox's were running around in 1955 , and what the time machine was . It was all very confusing . So like I said I rented no . 1 out , and it all started fitting together . So then I saw number 2 again , and seeing the " To be concluded " message , was a bit saddening , but yet I couldn't wait to see the grand finale . So for years the video stores I went to , for some reason never had it . Finaly one day I went there , and they had it , but no copy behind the box cover . SO when I finaly rented the movie out , about 2 weeks after that , the years of waiting had come , I popped open the box slid in the movie , pressed play AND . . . it got stuck in our VCR . Apparently they must've gotten it second hand , and it was about 6 years old . So then we took our VCR in for them to fix , since it was their film's fault . Lots of things happened , and they ended up forgetting to fix it or something like that . So about another 2 weeks went by , and I forget if they paid for a new VCR for us , but whatsoever , we had to get a new VCR because the other one was unfixable . After that I waited for them to get a new copy in , rented it out . I did the same thing as before , and it got stuck . NO OTHER MOVIE HAD DONE THIS BEFORE . . ONLY PART 3 TWICE IN A ROW . This time , i was able to pry the movie out , and took it back , explained , again . . . . and they said the film must've been so dirty inside it just got stuck when it started running . After that we tried different video stores , I was now desperate to see this movie . We finaly found another store with it , and this time the movie worked ( GASP ! ) . The beginning of the movie was great , but once he was in 1885 . . . All I can say is this film is ok , but it does not live up to it's predecessors . I'll give it , in the way of a good movie , but in the way of a sequel . . . no . . . a CONCLUSION yet . . only stars . If you disagree with me , all I can say is you must not of enjoyed BTTF part 1 and 2 . Because those , my friends are classic storytelling , at it's very best .
Good for the kiddies and manages to be one of the better Disney original movies . . .	This is a fun , well-made family's movie with good intentions . It's based off of the once-popular Disney Channel series " The Famous Jett Jackson , " which I used to catch on TV once in a while . I always considered it the best of the Disney Channel TV shows ( the rest are all mostly lame and unfunny and repetitive ) and the movie adaptation is acceptable for what it is . The best aspect is that the film approaches the series with a fresh idea and manages to come across as a child's version of " Mission : Impossible . " It begins with Jett ( Lee Thompson Young ) deciding to quit his famous role of teen-agent Silverstone , a top-secret action hero . However shortly after quitting the role ( at the disapproval of friends and family ) he's struck on the head and lapses into a long dream wherein he IS Silverstone , and no one else seems to believe he's an actor . In his dream , the villain Kragg ( Michael Ironside , devious and menacing as usual ) has perfected a means to travel between universes , and Jett has to stop him before he invades the " Real World . " This movie is nothing special and it's just a made-for-TV Disney movie , aimed at kids , so it has to be graded as such . Lee Thompson Young is a fine actor and has charisma - he handles the action sequences well , no matter how ridiculous they are . In the end it's easy to smirk at this and be a cynic , but it is intended for children and as such works well within the restraints . Of course the concept is silly and childish , but that's the point . It's enjoyable , unpretentious and isn't insulting like the other Disney " Original " Made-for-TV films . Worth catching if you see it on TV sometime , providing you have children . ( Or are a child at heart . )
Good family film . . .	Fun family film about a new boyscout leader ( Fred MacMurray ) who moves into a small hillbilly town circa 1930 and leads the band of kids from the city onwards into the great outdoors . Good , clean family entertainment from 1966 that boasts a young Kurt Russell as the brat who doesn't want to join at first and shoos away his enemies with a slingshot and a dog . Charming , although not particularly memorable . /
A disappointment	A BEAUTIFUL MIND ( 2001 ) ( stars ) Starring RUSSELL CROWE JENNIFER CONNELLY And ED HARRIS With CHRISTOPHER PLUMMERDirected by RON HOWARD Written by AKIVA GOLDSMAN RATING : PG-13 - for sexual content , and a scene of violenceThe much talked about film A BEAUTIFUL MIND from director RON HOWARD is over rated . In no way should this film have snagged the BEST PICTURE OSCAR . In fact , the best picture SHOULD have gone to LORD OF THE RINGS THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING instead . In the beginning of A BEAUTIFUL MIND , I found myself thinking , ' Wow , this really IS going to be good ! ' Because I , myself , thought RUSSELL CROWE shouldn't have won best actor for GLADIATOR 2 years ago , and now I was thinking that this'll make up for that . Wrong ! After Crowe's character starts becoming paranoid-an effect of schizophrenia , the movie just got weird . Something about it just was out of place , and though I know this film is based on the real JOHN NASH , I personally feel RON HOWARD messed up chances at possible good film . Among many other weird sequences with his ' friends , ' at the end of the film , though it may be a true story , I actually felt depressed-the OPPOSITE of what Ron said he tried to create at the end . I felt that out of his whole lifetime , all he did , all the terror ? All John Nash got was one Nobel Prize ? . And the other weird thing is , that he STILL sees those people - - the man , the girl and the spy . While this may be true , I got more of a horror vibe at this thought , rather than a ' wow , what an accomplishment . ' Ron could've presented this fact better than showing an 80 year old Nash , walking the college floors , and peering behind him , revealing the people , still standing there . I got a very , very weird feeling seeing this . The movie itself , wasn't that great either . Sure , it's good material , but not Oscar worthy ! Jennifer Connelly didn't do that great at acting in this film , either . She did better in THE LABYRINTH ! Don't take me wrong , this film's good , but not Oscar worthy . And like I said before , this film feels more like a horror picture than anything else , much less a drama ! See it , like it , whatever . But don't tell me it deserved an Oscar . Why does everyone like Ron Howard films ? All I've REALLY likes so far were APOLLO 13 and RANSOM . Other than that ? they're okay . NOT Oscar worthy though . This year's Academy Awards were given to the wrong people , and pictures . I'm sorry , but that's just my view of this film . Sue me , but I'll let you know , I'm giving A BEAUTIFUL MIND a good rating , just not a great one . stars-If you've got some points to point out , r just to say something about a movie I reviewed , or even to agree with me , you can email me .
Wonderfully bizarre .	This short feature was made by creature special effects artist Chris Cunningham as a personal project . Cunningham had previously worked with Aphex Twin and so they contributed to this project - resulting in a mix between narrative and music video , similar to Michael Jackson's " Thriller . " The video begins with a close-up night-vision shot of an alien creature named Rubber Johnny . A doctor seems to be talking to him - asking what's wrong , if he wants his mother , etc . Rubber Johnny seems incapable of speaking like a human and can only emit high-pitch frequency noises . The next scene shows Johnny in a wheelchair , his enormous head leaning backwards . His small pet dog watches as Johnny suddenly comes to live in an array of dazzling special effects shots and " dances " ( to some extent ) to Aphex Twin . The music is interrupted twice by Johnny's father opening the door into the basement and muttering unintelligible curses at him . My first thought after this was over : What a bizarre feature ! It actually might disturb some people - it's kind of unsettling and uncomfortable to watch . Also , as Johnny dances he occasionally flies full-speed into see-through glass , leaving remnants of his distorted face on the objects . Cunningham is quite an original guy - I don't know if it was the drugs doing all the talking or he's simply that far out , but I've never seen anything like this before . By the way , for those interested , it is freely available to view on YouTube . com , and is also available for purchase on DVD through Cunningham's official website .
Fantastically filmed war movie ( inspired by true events , which makes it even more unbelievable )	Black Hawk Down ( 2001 ) is truly a great war movie . Filmed extroirdinarally with gritty action scenes , this movie is ( one of ) the best war movies I've seen since Saving Private Ryan . The movie is based ( noticed BASED , which the director admitted they filled in A LOT of gaps they had no info on ) on true events of a small force of soldiers going into an african town to take out a leader and his men , whom are blocking all food from a close town . Even food America sends over , we learn , they take as theirs . So one bad thing leads to another , and the ride they came in on , crashes , hence the name Black Hawk Down . While I thought the film was a little of a copy off of SPR , with the camera movements , to the filming style itself , did not hinder this movie's effect on audiences at all . The pain , and whole torturous hours those soldiers were without help was shocking . It leaves you sitting in your seat after it's over , thinking what it must of been like , every second they were in theiir , always fighting . Getting this movie will pay off . I guarantee it-moviecritic2003
Intriguing sci-fi drama that suffers in the last stretch . . .	Another " Are we who we think we are ? " 1999 sci-fi drama about computer matrixes that are host to our very humanity . Scientist Scott Bierko visits a computer simulation of the 1930s in order to unlock the secret of his mentor's murder . This leads to some rather startling revelations . Bierko is sorely miscast , but he fits into the entire 30s picture quite nicely . Vincent D'Onofrio turns in a good performance as two separate characters related to each other via the computer world . This is an intriguing premise that would have probably been a lot more popular if not for " The Matrix " preceding it by a few months ( if memory serves me right ) . In retrospect , it seems very similar , but it also seems to be coincidence . Too bad the ending was so . . . silly . stars - - the 1930s evocations are the best of the entire picture . - John Ulmer
The ending is one of the best things about this above-average thriller .	" Cop Land " focuses on a small town in New " Jouzee " named Garrison . It is overlooked by corrupt cops that rule with an iron hand , and are in turn ruled by the mafia in New York . But beefy cop Sylvester Stallone is tired of looking the other way when something happens . " I look at this town , and I don't like what I see , " mutters Sylvester Stallone's character . Harvey Keitel , the " head cop , " replies saying , " Who do you think you are ? " That is the breaking point for Stallone's character . He turns to NY cop Robert DeNiro for help . His friend , Ray Liotta , eventually helps him to put a finish to the town's unfortunate rulers in a shoot-out ending . " Cop Land " isn't a great movie , but it is very entertaining , and the powerhouse ending is terrifically and refreshingly noble , not to mention that we are rooting for the good guy all the way . It's sublime . Sylvester Stallone seems to give one of his best performances in a long time . Stallone has recently been starring in a lot of a ) flops or b ) just plain stupid movies . This film proves that somewhere in there he has a little bit of acting talent . It's interesting to note that Stallone purposely and perfectly gained a bit of weight for this role - it's more believable this way . Having some muscular cop in a small town would be a bit . . . odd . The supporting cast is above good . It's excellent . Robert DeNiro isn't in the film more than twenty to thirty minutes total , but that's kind of nice . They didn't go overboard on his character - it seems more that Robert DeNiro is playing the character instead of the character playing Robert DeNiro . What I mean by this is that the filmmakers didn't write out a bigger role for the character when they found out DeNiro was pegged for it . I don't like when scripts are obviously rewritten around a certain actor . Seeing DeNiro in a supporting role is not only interesting to watch , but somehow refreshing . Harvey Keitel handles his role quite nicely , also , and is very believable and hateable as the corrupt cop . And like DeNiro , he was not transformed into the main character . Though he has much more screentime than DeNiro . Ray Liotta manages to impress once again with his role of another slightly overweight man who is tired of Garrison and just wants to get out . Alive . Robert Patrick , the T-1000 in " Terminator 2 , " is creepy as always - his " T2 " character seems to still be showing through a bit when he plays this role . " Cop Land " isn't a great film per say , but the ending is refreshingly right for once . It's not politically-correct , nor is it arrogant and disappointing . It's good to see something good happen on screen once and a while . The filmmakers don't give us a character we don't care about in shoot-out situations . They first introduce the characters to us , let us begin to see their qualities , and then at the end they throw them in a shoot-out and we all know who we're rooting for and why . The ending is one of the best things about this above-average thriller . stars - John Ulmer
" Austin Powers : The Spy Who Shagged Me " is light-hearted entertainment which supplied me with a ton of laughs !	Austin is back and more raunchy than ever in " Austin Powers : The Spy Who Shagged Me . " " Austin Powers : The Spy Who Shagged Me " is light-hearted entertainment which supplied me with a ton of laughs , no matter how crude they were . Mike Myers returns to his role of Austin Powers in this sequel , as well as playing Dr . Evil , and a new character , Fat Bastar # . Austin Powers has since settled down with new wife Vanessa Kensington ( Elizabeth Hurley ) since the first film , and is quite happy . Until he finds out his wife is a homicidal fembot of a bride bent on destroying him . After the Vanessa Fembot blows up , Austin immediately forgets about her and goes out for a photo shoot . But what Austin doesn't know is that Dr . Evil has a new plan - to steal Austin Powers ' mojo ! Evil ( along with a clone his size - played by Verne J . Troyer ) has sent Fat Bastar # back to the sixties to steal Powers ' mojo while he is cryogenically frozen . Without his mojo , Powers is nothing . So 90's Austin travels back to the 1960's to claim back his mojo - along with Felicity Shagwell ( Heather Graham ) - from a time-traveling Dr . Evil . This sequel is a lot different than the first film . The first seemed to be more of a spoof on the spy / James Bond genre . This movie , however , runs a bit more on Powers and his mojo - not a whole lot of Bond spoofs here . But that doesn't mean the jokes aren't any good . Dr . Evil has much more screen time in this sequel , and I'm happy for that . Dr . Evil is a character we didn't see a whole lot of in the original , and in this film , he has just as much - if not more - screen time than Powers himself ( it sounds weird referring to them as different actors - they're both Myers ! ) . Mike Myers is just as funny as he was in the first film . I recently viewed " So I Married an Axe Murderer " for the second and a half time , and I realized that Myers really isn't as funny when he's playing someone close to himself . His character in " So I . . . " isn't as shy as Myers is in real life , but he talks , looks , walks , smiles , and dresses like Myers . Myers as Powers is entirely different , however - he's about twenty times funnier . Not that Myers isn't funny , but you'll notice he is much more funny dressed up as someone else . Look at his " Saturday Night Live " skits and you'll see that Myers ' best skits were those when he dressed up as different people ( i . e . the Scottish Crap Store man ) . Heather Graham may not be the most talented actress , and I especially found her over - - or under - - acting in this film compared to her performances in " Boogie Nights " and " Bowfinger " - - but I think she may have done that on purpose . As we all know , Bond girls usually aren't the best actresses , so perhaps she over / under-acted as a parody on Bond films . Maybe not . Either way she's much better than Hurley was . Robert Wagner returns to the role of Number 2 , a spoof on . . . well . . . Number 2 from the James Bond film " Thunderball " - - complete with the eye patch and all . He does just as well as he did in the first film , if not better . I think he was a bit apprehensive of enveloping his character in the original " Powers " film - - but he seems more confident here . Mindy Sterling returns to her role of Frau , Dr . Evil's female henchman - - and we find out here that the only man she has ever been with - - or ever will be with - - is Dr . Evil . Their offspring ? Seth Green , reprising his role as Scott Evil - - whom was thought to be Dr . Evil's test tube baby , when he is , in fact , the outcome of a one-night-stand with Evil and Frau . Of course the chance that Evil would have the exact same son ( Green ) with Frau as he did when Scott Evil was born by means of test tubes ( even if Frau was the test tube mother ) is around one in 1 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 to the tenth power ( if that whole theory is a little unclear , sorry - - I can't think of any other way to put it without getting too . . . medical . . . ) , but that doesn't matter - - it's a comedy ! It's also worth mentioning that a younger version of Number 2 is played by Rob Lowe - - who perfectly mimicks Robert Wagner . All in all , " Austin Powers : The Spy Who Shagged Me " is not exactly the greatest comedy , but it's just about as good as the first , if off by a little . stars - John Ulmer
Newman and Redford re-team ; the result is extraordinary ; best con-man movie of all time . . .	I recently wrote a script and partial novel of a con man's adventures , and this extraordinary and extremely clever masterpiece was certainly one of my primary influences . I was first introduced to " The Sting " at a young age and I've loved it ever since . Gotta love Redford and Newman ! Oh , and then there's the plot on top of it all ! Just don't bother with the illegitimate sequel . . . stars . - John Ulmer
A surprising little low-budget film	I saw this listed in my TV guide and didn't think much of it - but then I looked it up on IMDb to discover that John Cusack and Julianne Moore , amongst others , had cameos in it - so I watched it . I was surprised because the IMDb rating is deceptive - it's actually pretty good . A bit flawed , yes , and the lead actor ( who plays a cabbie traveling the city at night ) could have employed a less cheesy NYC accent , but otherwise I was entertained . The overall tone of the movie is more pessimistic than I would have imagined ; the ending is bittersweet and surprising . Cusack's cameo is the best , as a secret service agent-type who is taking a ride in the cab in an effort to spy on someone . It's worth watching for his scene alone .
It feels right .	What struck me most about " The Simpsons Movie " - which has been in development for almost an entire decade - is that it really does feel like a piece of the past . During the mid-to-late-'90s , a lot of famous cartoon shows were getting big screen adaptations - and the style and scope of these cinematic efforts were all quite similar . " The Simpsons Movie " fits in well - similar to the " South Park " motion picture , it builds on the strength of the television show while using improved animation , a bigger story , and raunchier jokes . " The Simpsons Movie " isn't brilliant , and one can't help but imagine that a feature film made some time around the show's 5th and 6th seasons would have been far funnier , but it is a very good movie and it's also a lot better than any recent seasons of the show ( which have been in gradual decline for quite some time ) . One thing that the show has done recently is focus less on the actual characters - Homer has just turned into a slapstick buffoon , whereas in the earlier seasons he was a more realistic idiot who just got into funny predicaments . The movie is more in-tune with the older version of Homer - he does incredibly idiotic things , but the film focuses on the emotions of the character as well . Ditto for Bart - perhaps the show's most emotionally underdeveloped character finally gets some emphasis . The film is very entertaining and short enough that it doesn't outstay its welcome . But it does have flaws - it feels rather bloated , and the producers admirably try to include most of the characters from the TV show , but at a certain point this means focusing less on more interesting and consistent show regulars such as Mr . Burns and Smithers ( who are woefully neglected for most of the movie and really only have one funny scene - during the credits ! ) . You can tell this is a movie and not just an expanded episode of the TV show - it definitely feels like a blockbuster adaptation and you can also feel the long wait for this movie - it's truly shocking that it's taken them almost 20 years to bring a movie to the big screen given the huge , huge success of the TV show and merchandising profits over the years . The good news is that they didn't fail - it's a funny , entertaining movie and does justice to the show ( even the earlier seasons ) . The thing is , it's hard to say whether a 5th / 6th season era movie would have been better , because that early on in the show the producers might have felt rushed to deliver a film and the result could have actually ended up harming the show's reputation early on if it had failed . I do think it's a good thing that they waited this long to bring a movie to the big screen - and by waiting long enough and really developing the film over the years and investing time into the project , they've delivered a movie that's funnier than most recent seasons of the show - and contains more emotional resonance than I've seen on the show in over ten years . This is definitely one to see at least once on the big screen and later on once it reaches DVD . You may walk away feeling a bit underwhelmed given the near-20-years it's taken for the film to hit , or you may exit the theater with some fan gripes of your own , but I think it's safe to say that if you're a fan of the show - especially the older seasons - you'll at least walk away feeling somewhat satisfied . It may not be a great movie but it's a highly entertaining , very funny one - and , perhaps most importantly , it's not a disgrace to the legacy of the TV show by a long shot .
" Warriors . . . WARRIORS ! Come out and play-ee-AYYY ! " A really fun , cheesy suspense flick	" The Warriors " is a film that takes place in New York City during the hellish hours after dark , when the gangs emerge to roam the streets and search for their prey . One of these gangs , named The Warriors , agree to attend a gang meeting orchestrated by the enigmatic Cyrus ( Roger Hill ) . Each gang sends nine unarmed delegates to attend the huge meeting ; however , Cyrus is murdered by a thug , who blames the crime on the Warriors . They flee for their lives into the night , and soon every gang in New York City is looking for them . First things first : this movie is cheesy . The beginning is pretty laughable . The musical score is very much late ' 70s / early ' 80s electronica . But that is part of the movie's charm . Its polished big budget remake is coming out next year ( 2006 ) , and I personally feel it will fail because part of the success of this original film is that it IS low budget , poorly edited at times and simply a lot of fun to watch . It is very reminiscent of John Carpenter's 1976 low budget classic " Assault on Precinct 13 . " It achieves its thrills through heavy suspense ; as the Warriors prowl the streets heading back to their home turf we never know when a rival gang will appear out of nowhere and attack . The movie is now a video game by Rockstar Entertainment , and it's one of the few movies for which a video game actually seems to make sense - it feels very much like a level progression where bad guys attack the good guys , who have to use their brawn and brains to overcome them . Is " The Warriors " a great film ? No . From a technical standpoint , it's terrible . In terms of entertainment , it is extremely gripping . I was really enthralled . In recent years , Walter Hill has provided us with some really awful films , but " The Warriors " is a strong reminder that he once had a solid vision . . . it's too bad he's lost that now .
A very pleasant surprise - the best " sex " comedy in years .	The key to The 40-Year-Old Virgin is not merely that Andy Stitzer is a 40-year-old virgin , but rather the manner in which Steve Carell presents him as one . In a genre of crass " comedy " that has become typified by its lack of humor and engaging characters , The 40-Year-Old Virgin offers a colorful cast and an intelligent , heartfelt script that doesn't use its protagonist as the butt-end of cruel jokes . That Andy is still a virgin at forty years old is not as much a joke , in fact , as it is a curiosity . Carell , a veteran of Team Ferrell in Anchorman and an ex-Daily Show castmember , uses the concept of the film to expand his character ? we get to understand why Andy is the way he is . It's the little things that make this film work . When Andy's co-worker at an electronics store asks him what he did for the weekend , Andy describes his failed efforts at cooking . When Andy rides his bike to work , he signals his turns . He doesn't just adorn his home with action figures ? he paints them , and talks to them , and reveals that some of the really old ones have belonged to him since childhood . A lesser comedy wouldn't even begin to focus on all of these things . The plot is fairly simplistic ? Andy's co-worker pals find out he's never had sex and they make it a personal quest of theirs to get him in bed with a woman . It's a childish idea and the film makes no attempt to conceal its juvenility . Andy's friends are a complement to his neurotic nature : David ( Paul Rudd ) has broken up with his girlfriend over two years ago but is still obsessed with her , Jay ( Romany Malco ) is a womanizing ladies ' man and Cal ( Seth Rogen ) is a tattooed sexaholic . Their attempts at getting Andy in the sack backfire numerous times , and each time leaves Andy feeling less and less optimistic . Finally Andy meets single mom Trish ( played by Catherine Keener ) and , much to the chagrin of his worrying buddies who claim mothers aren't worth it , he falls in love with her . They begin a relationship and agree to put off having sex for twenty days ? Trish being unaware that Andy is still a virgin . The 40-Year-Old Virgin was directed by Judd Apatow , the man who produced Anchorman and The Cable Guy , and began the short-lived cult TV show Freaks and Geeks . Apatow is renowned for his unique sense of humor , and the script ? co-written by Carell ? offers plenty . However , in the end the most interesting and ( indeed surprising ) aspect of The 40-Year-Old Virgin is its maturity . By now you are probably well aware that the film received glowing reviews from the critics , and even I was surprised by its warm reception . But after seeing the film , it's easy to understand why . We like Andy . We care about him . He's not just some cardboard cutout sex-comedy cliché ? he's a real , living , breathing person . His neurotic traits combine the best of Woody Allen with childish naivety . His friends are not unlikable jerks and his romance is tumultuous and bittersweet . It strikes a chord with the audience . Although this is far from being a perfect movie and definitely contains some rather crude innuendo and sexual humor , it doesn't offend to the extent that other genre entries might have because we have affection for the people on-screen . The best sex comedies work this way ? from Risky Business to American Pie ? and that is the major difference between something like The 40-Year-Old Virgin and 40 Days and 40 Nights .
Technically ? A failure . But it's also a classic lightweight 80s romp with the always likable Michael J . Fox !	" The Secret of My Success " owes all its minimal success to the casting of Michael J . Fox , one of the most likable screen presences in all of film history . In " Back to the Future , " he was the overwhelmed high schooler who accidentally traveled back in time to 1955 and had to find a way back . In " Teen Wolf , " he was the highschooler turned into a werewolf . In " The Hard Way , " one of the best cop-buddy films of all time , he was the eager-to-please Hollywood actor trying to do some good-natured research . All his roles fall back on the Sweet Guy persona . In " The Secret of My Success , " he plays Brantley , a Kansas boy who makes the big move to the Big Apple , where he lands a job at his uncle Howard's ( Richard Jordan ) firm . He gradually makes his way up the ladder as a mail boy , but his real break comes when he is mistaken for a higher-up and tries to woo hard-to-get girl Christy ( Helen Slater ) , a beautiful co-worker of the company who buys Brantley's job position . Simple premise , but it becomes all the more entangled when Brantley has to run back and forth between different job positions , changing clothes in the elevator and getting in a heated affair with his uncle's wife ( played by Margaret Whitton ) , the kind of lady who doesn't take no for an answer . The film's amorality is what struck me on multiple viewings . It sort of seems dirty and unclean - - Brantley's a farm boy but he's eager to get in a romance with his aunt . The casual sexuality of the film is what , ultimately , makes it sort of disturbing , and also sort of memorable , as odd as that may sound . Fox shines in the lead role , and with any other actor the film would simply fall flat on its face . And , to be honest , a film like this could never be made nowadays - - I can imagine Jim Carrey in such a role , but the outcome would be wholly different . The eighties were an entire generation of comedy unto themselves . A lot of people love the comedies from the eighties because so many were made with so little thought and yet a lot of heart , kind of like " The Secret of My Success . " Its mediocrity is what drives it , amazingly , but also its heart , and so many comedies nowadays lack the heart of the comedies from the eighties . I come back to " The Secret of My Success " a lot , probably because I saw it on TV when I was younger and it's been in my head ever since . It's a routine film that's hardly recommendable , but I actually enjoy it a lot the more I watch it , and it has a kind of frenetic comedic energy that most of the films of the genre are lacking nowadays . The script , by Jim Cash nd Jack Epps Jr . , seems as though it were one from an earlier decade . It has a delightful sweetness to it that's simply not unnoticeable . I understand how many would dislike this film . The critic Roger Ebert gave " The Secret of My Success " stars upon its inital release in 1987 . I can't say I wouldn't have , either , if I were in his shoes . But comedies , over time , sort of grow on you , and this is one of those cases . It's not as good as " Back to the Future , " or " The Hard Way , " but it's a lot like Fox's " Teen Wolf " ( 1985 ) : fast-paced , extremely routine , cliched , flawed , and lots of fun . Don't miss this one , even if it isn't exactly the pinnacle of comedy . stars . - John Ulmer
Pure Movie Magic from Beginning to End . . .	" I've got a bad feeling about this . " - Han Solo , Star Wars There's no reason to have a bad feeling about " Star Wars . " The film is as shallow as a donut hole and a pure masterpiece . Rarely have I seen a shallow motion picture also be a memorably exciting and visually dazzling one , also . There's something more to " Star Wars " than just good visual effects , though . It is a fun movie , a playful movie , and it inhabits our memory . I've analyzed it many times before . I came to the realization that there is simply nothing there virtually . But was there ever anything filling up classics like " 2001 " or " Metropolis " ? Well , maybe , but that's what seperates " Star Wars " - it's just fun . Fun with holes the size of the Grand Canyon . To fully understand the significance of " Star Wars , " you must understand the time . It was 1977 , and audiences were still raving about the special effects witnessed in Stanley Kubrick's " 2001 : A Space Odyssey . " When word came out that " Star Wars " director George Lucas was borrowing the ideas of an outer space saga from Kubrick , it appeared to waiting audiences at first to be another rip-off . But something astonishing happened . Audiences were amazed to see that Lucas had actually improved upon Kubrick's space vision of the future . This was the first film to ever show a space-projected background move with the camera . This was the first film to see hyper-speed space fighters duking it out at lightspeed . " Star Wars " was the first of its kind . It wasn't as serious as " 2001 , " it's not even necessarily a better film , it's just a different film , and no one and nobody expected that . To go into the plot is pointless , as ( a ) it really makes no particular sense and ( b ) it is already known by everyone around the world . I will say that the actors involved in this film ( Ford , Hamill , Fisher , Guinness , Jones , etc . ) all did a great job . How often do you see such a great cast make you care about their characters ? Harrison Ford steals the show as Han Solo , and the robot droids R2-D2 and C-3PO have chemistry ( I never thought I'd say that about robots ) . The film seems to be filled to the rim with nonsense spiritual dialogue about the Force - something that is all around us and joins our spirits together - but the dialogue is so cheesy it must be so awful on purpose . The actual story behind the film is a metaphorical study of the Bible . The Force is God and Darth Vader is Satan , and all the subplots going on are very reminiscent of spiritual warfare . " Star Wars " is an updated telling of the Bible , full of hyperspace battles and lightsaber fights . The special effects in " Star Wars " were so revolutionary that George Lucas started his own special effects company named ILM , and the film itself inspired so many rip-offs over the year it is amazing . Everyone - everyone - knows this movie . Just like " Casablanca , " " It's a Wonderful Life , " and so on and so forth , this is a film everyone remembers , and probably always will . And those in the future who may forget about this motion picture . . . well . . . May the Force be with them . Stars -
One Of the Rare Franchises That Never Gets Too Overbearing and Dull . . .	Lethal Weapon 4 starts out with a boring and ridiculous beginning . I remember watching it the first time and thinking , " oh no , another bad sequel . " However , once past the first ten minutes , the film starts to pick up its pace and retreat into familiar Lethal Weapon style . Just like film 2 and 3 , Lethal Weapon 4 isn't as good as the original , but it never gets to the point of unbearable . It is quite entertaining and fun to watch , with some very great actors , that have some very great chemistry between each other . Mel Gibson and Danny Glover fit like a glove , and Joe Pesci is perfect as the comedy relief , not being like the recent " side kicks " we always see , that are so obnoxious we want to punch them . Mr . Pesci is a very talented actor , and he always makes me laugh , whether it's Lethal Weapon 4 or Raging Bull and Casino . Rene Russo provides Mel's love interest yet again , and though I found the marriage thing a bit of a throw-in , it was still good for the story . It provided some laughs at the end of the film . Chris Rock stars in one role where his character is not completely annoying or loudmouthed , mainly because he wasn't extremely famous yet , and had only been on SNL and a few small roles in film . . . Joes Pesci and him throw back and forth a few insults and jokes , and bounce off each other , which helps me welcom Rock a bit more . Jet Li's first American film , I believe , proves he can be a quite and intriguing character , which later helped him get roles in films like Kiss of teh Dragon and The One . Another thing about this franchise is that director Richard Donner directed all four films , and it's always good to use the original director for a sequel , rather than a lesser director , as we have countless examples of . ( especially horror films ! ) From the opening jazz music we have come to love , Lethal Weapon provides enough entertainment and fun to keep one entertained , and it's definitely worth watching . I hope they stop while they're ahead , and do not make another Lethal Weapon film , because it's rare for a film series to still be entertaining and imaginitive after these many sequels . stars-JOHN ULMER
Peter Jackson needs to go back and start making movies like this again	In retrospect , you'd never know this is a Peter Jackson film . Not after becoming familiar with his recent work , anyway . " Heavenly Creatures " contains all the subtlety and nuances that his later work desperately needs - the graceful arc of the " Lord of the Rings " trilogy , despite its critical lauding , doesn't hold a candle to this film . Melanie Lynskey plays Pauline , a young girl who , along with her best friend Juliet ( Kate Winslet ) , often envisions herself in fantasy worlds and alternate realities . The two girls ' parents become so worried about their fantasies that they separate the two girls - but , in a fit of rage , Melanie and Juliet plan a dreadful revenge . Most shocking of all is that this story sounds like some lame supernatural thriller that would be on a made-for-TV special , in which the girls share some kind of psychic connection - but it's not like that at all . It's a true story , and it's handled quite delicately . The performances are , for the most part , very good . Winslet shines in one of her earlier performances and displays raw talent . Overall , watching this I couldn't help but be reminded of how talented Peter Jackson used to be , and how lately he has succumbed to making , for lack of a better description , Hollywood shlock . I liked " Lord of the Rings . " I liked " King Kong . " But this is better .
Surprisingly good addition to the " Rocky " series . . .	" No , I don't hate Balboa . I pity the fool . " - Mr . TWho would have ever thought that , after a sequel to a movie that needed none , the " Rocky " chronicles could remain so interesting ? Yes , a lot of people make fun of these movies , but I've always thought that the " Rocky " sequels were a lot better than they could have been - - especially considering the fact that the first film is arguably one of the greatest ever made , and definitely not the type of film that should have merited four sequels . How many times can we see Rocky re-train and win a battle ? It's always the same . Yet somehow " Rocky III " comes across as a fresh one-two punch . Extremely easy to watch and fun to get into , this is a retread of the first and second film . But , as I said , somehow everything seems fresh . Arguably the final " good " film in the series ( although I still consider the last two passable ) , this chapter sees the death of Mickey ( Burgess Meredith ) , a fierce opponent ( Mr . T ) ready to take on Rocky Balboa ( Sylvester Stallone ) , an angry Paulie ( Burt Young ) , an eager-to-train Apollo Creed ( Carl Weathers ) , and an insane 7-foot boxer ( Hulk Hogan ) . After defeating Apollo Creed at the end of Part II , Rocky is challenged and defeated in the ring by Clubber Lang ( Mr . T ) . Things continue to go wrong when his boxing trainer dies , and Rocky drifts into a state of self loathing and hatred . After the city of Philadelphia presents him with a statue of himself , he drives over to it with his motorcycle and throws his helmet at it . Rocky blames himself for Mickey's death , and nearly turns down Apollo's offer to train Rocky so that he can enter the ring one more time and give a real beating to Clubber Lang . But alas , he decides to enter into the ring one last time , and so with the help of Apollo and his wife ( Talia Shire ) , he trains harder and longer than he ever has before . That is all there is , in short . In between we get corny dialogue like , " You've gotta get back the Eye of the Tiger , man ! " while the song plays in the background as we see Rocky and Apollo running on the beach in short-shorts and lifting weights together and boxing and doing jump ropes . ( These things may be interpreted as homosexual nowadays , by the way . ) Having boxed a bit myself , the " Rocky " series always seems pretty close to reality . I've never been in a ring like " real " boxers , but I've done the same training with boxing bags and running and jump ropes and so on . It's hard work , just like it is in the movie . And this is the perfect film to give you the inspiration to work out . Strange , right ? Don't ever , ever quote me on that last paragraph . In fact , just forget the entire thing . The film , written and directed by Stallone , is surprisingly sweet and endearing . We still care for Rocky after three films - - and hey , as old as the training scenes may get , I still love them . This movie isn't as good as the first " Rocky , " or maybe even the second , but I still say that this series has a long way to go before it reaches the murky depths of " Police Academy . " And take some advice from Stallone : " Boy , sometimes charity really hurts ! " Oh , wait , never mind . Wrong quote . How about this ? " Nothing is real if you don't believe in who you are ! " Okay , it's not the next " Citizen Kane . " But you'll be hard-pressed to find a more entertaining second sequel than this . stars . - John Ulmer
Not your average comedy . . .	Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones team up along side Vincent D ' Onfrio and Rip Torn for the 1997 hit MEN IN BLACK . Smith is agent J . Just recruited to a top secret government organization MIB that monitors extra-terrestrial life on Earth . Jones is K . The man who recruits J . and who is a long time member of the MIB . Together they must team up to stop a bug in a human's body ( Vincent D ' Onfrio ) under the guidance of Rip Torn . MIB never let's in on the laughs , and is nothing like your average comedy . It's worthy of the success it's had , but I hear the sequel stinks . Too bad . Maybe in MIIIB ( MIB 3 ) they should come up with some original plot lines and jokes like MIB 1 . Because even if the sequel's horrible , MIB is a great blend of comedy , action , and sc-fi . starsJOHN ULMER

Brilliant and confusing	" Pi " is about a brilliant mathematician who finds himself tracked down by code-seeking Jews and a strange corporation , both of whom are seeking the same thing : a universe-unlocking sequence of numbers that explain the sequences in life , etc . This movie is weird . It's confusing and dark . It's also utterly brilliant in the way director / writer Darren Aronofsky manages to make the most out of a low-budget by way of creepy black and white photography ( which makes for very paranoid viewing ) and surprisingly convincing acting . Also I found the fact that this " drama " is scarier than most horror films released nowadays quite refreshing . I wish more movies were like " Pi . " It is bewildering and a bit alienating , yes , but nevertheless totally mesmerizing and entertaining . It is well-directed , well-written and unlike anything I have ever seen before , although if comparisons must be drawn it reminded me a bit of " Memento " for some reason . Perhaps because both films refuse to follow conventional film-making and for that reason alone , " Pi " is worth a lot of praise .
Denis Leary is hilarious	I've been a fan of Denis Leary's work ever since I saw Ted Demme's 1994 film " The Ref , " which is an EXTREMELY underrated black comedy about a bickering couple taken hostage by a harmless thief around Christmas . Leary was hilarious in the film and I made an effort to track down some of his other efforts . A lot of his film output hasn't been so great ( the one with Sandra Bullock - " Two If By Sea " - is okay at best ) , but his stand-up still rocks . " Lock N ' Load " is a scathingly offensive attack on everything in sight : life , politics , alcohol , cigarettes , coffee , religion , sex , kids , family , etc . . . Leary has put on a few pounds since " The Ref " ( looking a bit on the chubby side ) which led me to believe this was only filmed recently - however I was surprised to find it had been filmed almost a decade ago ! Some of the parts are simply hysterical and it proves , if nothing else , that Denis Leary is one of the funniest men in the world .
A harrowing and powerful film	Loosely based on the true story of Billy Hayes ( collected from his book of the same title ) , Alan Parker's " Midnight Express " contains some of the most effective and rightly iconic scenes in all of film history - - the opening with the heartbeats devoid of any soundtrack ; the " Oh Billy ! " segment ; and of course the entire idea of Turkish prisons being terrible and abusive . Hayes ' story was elaborative to begin with and Oliver Stone - - not exactly one to be known for sticking close to the truth - - exaggerates it even more ; so far , indeed , that it almost becomes fictional . The real Hayes had no girlfriend , was not raped in jail , DID have a homosexual relationship with another inmate ( the film shows him denying the advances ) , and escaped at night by sea . However , as a film this is probably one of the great motion pictures of the 1970s . Parker ( " Angel Heart " ) is a brilliant visual director and uses much of the same imagery he would use later on in his career . For example , take note of the fans in the sweltering heat inside the courtroom . They'd be used again in " Angel Heart . " Brad Davis gives a wonderful performance and convincingly devolves from a naive American student to a crazy lunatic by the time he enters the insane asylum . John Hurt's performance was also worthy of its Oscar nomination . Overall , this is very much a product of its time - - it's depressing , bleak , and almost painful to watch ; and because it's a Stone screenplay , there's a lot of politics at play . However , the overall film is breathtaking , thrilling and unpredictable ( to a point ) - - it's definitely worth seeing at least once in your lifetime .
Steamy classic still holds up to this day !	Robert Rossen's " The Hustler " is widely considered to be one of the greatest films of all time , and I would eagerly agree . Although it may seem dated on first inspection , it still contains rather subtle ( or not-so-subtle ) elements of sex , alcoholism , violence and drug abuse - - although it doesn't " show " all of these things , it certainly implies it . " The Hustler " is one of the key films of the 1960s and paved the way for the controversial , mature cinema of the late 1960s and 1970s . In an era when color comedies starring Rock Hudson and Doris Day were flooding the cinemas , " The Hustler " - - shot in grim black-and-white - - carries an aroma of steamy sensuality and visual decadence that helps to retain its classic status to this day . " The Hustler " follows the young " Fast " Eddie Felson ( Paul Newman ) , a pro pool player renowned for never losing a game . When he goes up against Minnesota Fats ( Jackie Gleason ) , his pride pays a price and he loses everything . Meanwhile he falls in love with the seductive Sarah ( Piper Laurie ) , an addict who pulls Eddie down into her world . And he strikes a contract with the seedy manager Bert ( George C . Scott ) in order to regain his composure and take on Minnesota Fats again . " The Hustler " follows the routine sports-film formula : Our hero loses , falls in love , trains again and goes up against the " villain " of the film ( who , in this case , are probably two people - - Minnesota Fats AND George C . Scott ) . This approach can be seen in just about any sports film , particularly " Rocky " which would be released over a decade later . But like " Rocky , " at the core of " The Hustler " is an examination of a man , and not the sport . This is a character-driven piece that uses pool as a backdrop to the human conflict . Fast Eddie Felson is one of cinema's deepest characters ( his evolution in " Color of Money , " based on his wisening experiences here , particularly satisfying and realistic ) . " The Hustler " portrays Fast Eddie before he matures into the older man we see in Martin Scorsese's belated sequel - - this is great because it only complements the story and character's continuation . Some people have complained that the movie becomes too " bogged down " in its middle and focuses on the home-life of Fast Eddie with his girlfriend . Although I initially felt the same , and do feel it probably is a bit too long at times , it's important to remember that this is supposed to be a character study , not a sports film ( as the DVD documentary claims many people misjudge it as ) . As a sports-themed film , " The Hustler " is very good . As a character-driven motion picture , it is one of the best of its kind and a true classic with some of the most steamy b & w visuals ever captured on film . Highly recommended !
Sleepless in New York	" When Harry Met Sally . . . " is one of those rare , one in a million motion pictures that becomes a cultural icon . It's been needlessly ripped off , and endlessly spoofed since its release in 1989 . In fact , this year's " Dumb and Dumberer : When Harry Met Lloyd " is even a pun on it . At least the title , anyway . Many people will tell you the plot is weak , but the movie is good because of characters . Okay , well , I disagree . I think the plot , the characters and the script all work together to form an excellent romantic comedy . Whether it be the irony in the script , the characters ' quirks or the smart , snappy , crisp dialogue thrown between Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan , " When Harry Met Sally " not only meets every expectation , but exceeds . The film opens up with Harry Burns ( Crystal ) and Sally Albright ( Ryan ) driving to New York . Sally is best friends with Harry's girlfriend , Amanda . As they drive along , Harry and Sally start getting into a heated debate over " Casablanca . " This discussion ends in discussing something a bit more risque : If men and women can sleep together and still be friends in the morning . Harry's standpoint is a no . Sally says yes . Harry explains that " no man can be friends with a woman that he finds attractive . He always wants to have sex with her . " Sally replies , " So , you're saying that a man can be friends with a woman he finds unattractive ? " Harry comes back with , " No . You pretty much want to nail ' em too . " That's the kind of dialogue you get a lot in this movie . If you want to compare Crystal's character to another fictional one , it would be George from " Seinfeld . " George has all these intricate theories worked out about everything , from double-dipping to violating the " splash zone . " ( If you've seen the episode I'm talking about you'll get it . ) Harry Burns is the same way . Only his theories are all on sex , and / or the differences between men and women . You could call him pessimistic . He admits he has a dark side . Sally says , " I have as much of a dark side as the next person . " Harry replies , " When I get a new book , I read the last page first so I know what happens in case I die . That , my friend , is a dark side . " Funny , I do the same thing and I've never really thought about it . Writer Nora Ephron based her screenplay on none other than the director of the film - Rob Reiner - and his love life . She sat down with him and another person once , and listened intently to his stories . According to her , she then coughed up a screenplay , handed it to Rob , and they made the film . Rob Reiner is one of the most talented and dependable directors in Hollywood . He adds a certain innocence , a certain charm , and a certain chemistry to his films that is hard to miss . His last great ( or very good ) film was " The American President , " but everyone finds themself in a ditch after a while , and I think as far as directors go , Reiner was one of the most consistently dependable directors during the eighties and nineties . Check this out : " This is Spinal Tap , " " The Princess Bride , " " When Harry Met Sally , " " Misery , " " Sleepless in Seattle , " " The American President " : All very good - some great - motion pictures that have become as famous as I don't know what . Coming to the cast , Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan are an absolute comic and romantic pairing . Every line is real . Every inch of attraction doesn't seem artificial . I swear that the first fifteen minutes of this film has some of the most interesting , engaging and downright smart dialogue I have ever seen in a film . Crystal and Ryan - especially Crystal - really break down everything and kind of make rules out of everything . Like Harry's amendment in the beginning , or how they dissect everything later on in the film and analyze it . I like when characters in films are quirky and have theories on everything . To me , people that have theories on life might as well hold the meaning of life in their hands , because to them , they are . " When Harry Met Sally " is a keen observation on modern life , romance , men , women , friendship , and sex . And if you want something a bit tamer and more for the general audience , I recommend " Sleepless in Seattle , " which has just as much chemistry and observation going on as " When Harry Met Sally " does . In a time of cheap teen romance films , artificial dialogue and downright uninteresting stories , rarely does a romantic comedy like this come along , and it's an honor to watch something as observational , true , sweet , engaging , humorous , and lovely as " When Harry Met Sally . " stars - John Ulmer
A visionary masterpiece from David Cronenberg .	I can't say I enjoyed " Naked Lunch , " but watching it was an experience unlike any other . It got inside my brain . At times , I felt absolutely appalled . Only those with very strong stomachs will be able to handle it , and it will change the way you view many things - typewriters , mainly . Yet , at the same time , it's entirely fascinating and unique - and Peter Weller ( " RoboCop " ) delivers a fantastic performance . You may have trouble finding a plot synopsis for " Naked Lunch , " and that's mostly because it doesn't have one . It's about a bug exterminator who gets hooked on his own bug powder , accidentally kills his wife , flees to the Interzone and starts writing reports to typewriter bugs . What are the reports ? Why is he writing them ? What does any of it have to do with the beginning ? I had no idea . I don't really think that's the point . Cronenberg adapts the " unfilmable " novel by Burroughs and turns it into a semi-biographical story . Weller is clearly imitating Burroughs from beginning to end with the low , grave voice and the movie mixes elements from the book with elements from Burroughs ' real life . All in all , I'd say you should see this if you want to really screw up your head . It'll leave you feeling dazed . You should NOT see it if you are accustomed to mainstream Hollywood and you thought " Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas " was the weirdest movie you've ever seen - this makes " Loathing " look like a formulaic Jerry Bruckheimer action movie .
One of the most enjoyable lightweight entertainments in years !	Pairing Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson together may seem the most unlikely thing to do since color televisions were first invented . But both of these actors are funny , in one way or another - - Chan through his innocence , Wilson through his sarcastic , snide remarks . Wilson is as impressive an actor as he is a writer - - he shares writing credits on such films as " Rushmore " and " The Royal Tenenbaums . " Chan , on the other hand , is a better martial arts master than Jet Li and a more likable character actor than Chow Yun Fat ( whose disastrous film " Bulletproof Monk " made me want to split his head open to prevent him from ever making another American mainstream motion picture ever again ) . In " Shanghai Noon , " Chan plays Chon Wang , a 19th century Chinese martial arts master who ventures out to Nevada in order to rescue the kidnapped Princess Pei Pei ( Lucy Liu ) , whose name is misused by Roy O'Bannon ( Wilson ) on at last one occasion . After Chon Wang ( mistakenly pronounced " John Wayne " ) meets up with Roy , the two decide to form an alliance and rescue the princess - - one for honor , the other for loads of money awaiting them upon her safe arrival back home in Imperial China's Forbidden City . Roy is a lousy wannabe cowboy who used to stage clumsy train robberies along with his band of thieves , who betrayed him and left him for dead . He offers his help to Wang , and tries to play it cool , but he can't - - after all , he's not a very convincing cowboy . But , as the smarmy wisecracking sidekicks always are , O'Bannon just wants money . But as his friendship with Chan grows stronger , he realizes that money isn't everything . Sounds routine , doesn't it ? Well , it is , to a certain extent . But it succeeds due to a fine cast - - Chan and Wilson are extraordinarily good together ; so good , in fact , that Chris Tucker is just a forgotten memory by the time that the film is over . It's a classic spin on the Old West formula ; what " The Princess Bride " or " Shrek " did for fairy tales , " Shanghai Noon " does for Westerns . All the old cliches are poked fun at in a light way . And as great as Chan is , and as much as he carries most films he's in with his sweet charms and likable personas , Wilson comes across as equally likable as Chan . Chan's martial arts are usually the highlights of these films , but in this he proves he can do more than just kick - - he can be funny . Well , okay , he proved that in " Rush Hour " ( 1998 ) , but I like this better . The jokes in " Shanghai Noon " aren't " great , " but I laughed a lot at this film . It's smarter than one might think , and is certainly one of the most enjoyable experiences I've had in quite some time . Probably years . I wasn't expecting much ( especially because I wasn't an enormous fan of the sequel - - see below ) , but if fun could be rated on a scale of 1 - 10 , this would be an 11 . I give this film nothing more than four out of five stars because it's not a great film on all critical levels . But it's certainly fun - - likely more fun than any film you'll see for quite some time - - and for that it will soon be earning a place in my sacred DVD collection . I must say that I wasn't a huge fan of " Shanghai Knights , " the sequel to " Shanghai Noon , " which involved Chon Wang and Roy O'Bannon venturing to England in order to save Wang's sister . But after seeing this film I'm thinking I might just have to pay a small revisit the sequel again . stars . - John Ulmer
It's not the same as the UK show - give it a chance	First of all , the humor is very different . I suppose you could use the word " Americanized " to describe it . However , I find it to be one of the cleverest shows currently on television . It has a strong cast of characters , great writing and clever dialogue . Steve Carrell plays Michael Scott , the arrogant , egotistical and obnoxious head of some type of accounting firm who is always managing to embarrass himself at the most inopportune times . My favorite episode of the show is " Diversity Day , " when a man comes in to the office to discuss racial equality and respect due to racist comments Michael had made in jest a few days prior ( whilst quoting a Chris Rock routine ) . Refusing to acknowledge his actions , Michael pretends that he " pushed " to have the diversity awareness speaker visit the office . . . the pay-off had me on the floor with laughter . Carrell impersonating Chris Rock is simply one of the funniest things I've ever seen . I didn't give a very good comment for the British show because I had apparently seen a bad episode ( or so people who PM'd me said ) , and the other episodes are usually a lot funnier . I guess I should give it another chance . However , people comparing this to the British show and saying it's not as funny should keep in mind it's also a different sort of humor - it will probably appeal more to Americans , yes - and you shouldn't totally discredit it simply because it's a remake of another show .
One of the great ones - dark , depressing , bleak , uncompromising and an important statement on alcoholism .	I can't imagine how this got greenlit back in 1945 . It's almost impossible to imagine a film like this being made back then - the era where women weren't allowed to have their dresses crease around their buttocks and " show the shape of their behinds " ( as Carl Reiner put it on commentary for the Dick Van Dyke show ) . Seen sixty ( ! ) years later , it still holds up amazingly well . A great deal of films from the 1940s and ' 50s seem outdated today , but the issue of alcoholism will probably never die . . . and as long as it exists , this movie will remain prescient . Ray Milland delivers a powerful performance as Don Birnem , a recovering alcoholic whose girlfriend Helen ( Jane Wyman ) and brother Wick ( Phillip Terry ) have planned a weekend getaway to the country , to take his mind off the booze . Don makes up an excuse not to go - he says he wants to be alone . His brother is suspicious of his decision , but nevertheless leaves without him . After the two leave , Don pulls a bottle of alcohol through his window , which was tied to a string by the window sill , hidden from view outside the apartment . Don makes his daily visit to the bar where Nat ( Da Silva ) the Bartender serves his drinks . The more he drinks , the more Don spirals downwards into a hellish nightmare , complete with flashbacks to his past where he is reminded of the destructive patterns of his addiction . I bought this movie a few months ago out of curiosity , mainly because I saw it had been directed by Billy Wilder . Wilder is most commonly known for his comedies like " The Apartment " and " Some Like It Hot , " but here he shows he has a great eye for drama . This is a superb film on all levels . The themes are gripping and important , the acting is totally uncompromising and the direction is top notch . I'd say it's one of the best and most underrated films of the 1940s ; I had personally never heard of it before . . . I'm glad I stumbled across it .
Funnier than the original	I was not a huge fan of the original SHREK and think it is vastly overrated . Enjoyable , but not great . SHREK 2 bored me at first and I was unimpressed but after the half hour mark it suddenly picked up with the Puss in Boots ' entrance . This is one of the funniest films I've seen this summer , crammed with pop culture references ( love the COPS spoof and all the signs in the background of Far Far Away advertising fake films ) , and a surprising amount of adult humor - - more than the original . ( " Catnip ! " " Uh , that's not mine . " ) The jokes aren't quite as knowing as the first one and it spoofs fairy tales more than the first did . The original SHREK seemed more bent on poking fun at the whole hero-rescues-princess notion ; SHREK 2 spoofs every classic fairy tale legend . Overall SHREK 2 is a pure summer delight and much funnier than the first . Somehow the approach to the series seems very different from the original SHREK ( the simplicity , I suppose , is gone ) but it's hilarious for all ages .
Hugely underrated film noir	" Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye " is about a jail convict ( James Cagney ) who escapes from prison and goes on the run , relentlessly pursued . He eventually winds up in a small town where he gets a girl and starts a normal life , but begins to corrupt everyone around him . The movie is not very well known and I'm not sure quite why . Although this movie might not be definitive film noir it surely carries certain elements of the genre , and of course it's got James Cagney in it , one of the ultimate veterans of the genre ! Cagney delivers a really solid performance and comes across as both likable and despicable . We feel for him and those around him as his bad influence spreads and the tragic tale takes a turn for the worst . Although it's a very clear moral tale and ends up exactly where we can expect , " Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye " is nevertheless a very good , underrated film whose virtually nonexistent reputation is as depressing as the film itself .
Not my favorite but definitely the most memorable film of all time . . .	Some of this review was edited due to this site's word limit . Regarding " Casablanca , " Roger Ebert wrote in his Great Movies essay , " If we can identify strongly with characters in some movies , then it is no mystery that ' Casablanca ' is one of the most popular films of all time . " Add " and one of the most memorable " to that statement . Almost any list you happen to come across of great movies will contain " Casablanca , " as it has almost nestled itself firmly into our world's foundation . It is what one would call a memorable film . It may not be memorable for the audiences of today who find it boring , long , weary and tiresome , but it will always be remembered . That isn't something you can say for most movies . In one hundred years , do you think " The Lord of the Rings " trilogy will really - really - be remembered ? " Casablanca " is a love story , just as so many other films released to this day , but upon a viewing two nights ago , I asked myself what sets it apart from the rest . Just what has made it what it is today ? Is it the direction by Michael Cortiz , the chemistry between the actors , or the actors themselves ? Is it the sly side of dark comedy , or just the nostalgia of the film that drives so many viewers ? Or perhaps it is the cliffhanger finale ( those filming the movie didn't even know what would happen at the end of the film due to constantly changing scripts and the 1940s Production Code permitting a married woman from leaving her husband for another man ) . Even if it isn't , the ending is superb , depressing and uplifting , one of the strangest , saddest , and happiest endings I have ever seen , in which Bogart mutters the famous last lines , " I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship . " Bogart plays Rick Blaine , a chain smoker and heavy drinker living in Casablanca , French Morocco , during WWII . During WWII , European immigrants fled from their homeland down to Africa , in hopes of sailing off the coast to Portugal , and then to America , land of freedom . Because of this , Casablanca is inhabited by petty thieves , vicious murderers , and ruthless citizens . Every day a plane leaves from the local airport , carrying the precious few with Visa Passes to freedom . Those applying for a Visa Pass on the black market might come in contact with the crook Ugarte ( Peter Torre ) . One night the thief Ugarte visits Rick's bar in Casablanca and asks him to hide two Visa Passes he has acquired by unrespectable means . Rick reluctantly agrees , only to watch Ugarte be taken away by French officials the same night , in his very bar . " Rick , you have to help me ! " he screams as he is dragged away . Rick takes a puff on his cigarette and remains solid . A bystander says , " Gee , Rick , I hope when they come to take me away you help me out a little bit more than that ! " Rick remains a statue and says , " I stick my neck out for nobody . " We can sense Rick was a good guy at one time , but as Marilyn Monroe once said , he probably " got the fuzzy end of the lollipop . " He is tired of fighting for the good cause . So he maintains his bar and tries not to care about anyone . His piano player Sam ( Dooley Wilson ) knows the real Sam , and tries to evoke it , but Sam just sits in silence and drinks and smokes and lets himself stay drenched in misty smoke . That all remains until Ilsa Lund ( Ingrid Bergman ) walks through his doors . It turns out that Ilsa left Sam and Rick waiting at a train station in the rain some time ago in Paris , France , during the German occupation . Rick never saw her since . That night she walks into his bar , he sits at a table in his joint , and in a mopy tone says , " Of all the gin joints in all the world , she walks into mine . " This is a very effective line . Do delve into the plot any further is pointless . Not only will it spoil interesting tidbits , but it is just plain pointless to explain anymore . But I will say that every frame is handled with care and the extreme close-ups in this film are amazingly effective . Sergio Leone was known for his extreme close-ups , but those in " Casablanca " seem to capture an innocence of the characters that I have rarely seen equaled in other films . Bogart is at the top of his game in this film , only equaled in " The Maltese Falcon . " Ingrid Bergman is superb , as well , but the supporting cast is equally impressive . Sydney Greenstreet , Peter Lorre , Claude Rains , Peter Henreid and Dooley Wilson all steal the show - well , maybe not Henreid , but that's because he's not really supposed to . This is the perfect example of a well-rounded cast . Too often nowadays attention is paid to the lead actors and not the supporters - this has both great leads and great supporters . People often ask me what my favorite film is . And to be frankly honest , it certainly isn't " Casablanca . " To me , lists of favorites in ranking order are pointless and silly - who am I to declare my favorite film , when I have not even seen some of the greatest unknown films out there ? If someone asks me to tell them my favorite film I have seen , I usually say I don't have one . I still think lists of favorite-ever films are silly . I have various favorites in various genres , but not an " all-time-favorite . " Despite this , " Casablanca " is one of those films that has permeated our culture . It will never go away . I'm not sure if it's one of my top ten favorites , but if there is a difference between a favorite film and a most memorable film , " Casablanca " sure does disguise it .
A beautiful film to look at and experience so many years later	Although " Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs " is most commonly considered to be the first full-length , color-animated film of its kind , in 1926 this adaptation of the " Arabian Nights " stories was created using silhouette animation by Lotte Reiniger , and it's just as wonderful to look at . She spent three years cutting out the figures to be used in the film , and the result is a visual marvel - I notice my television guide only gave it two and a half stars ( from four ) , less than they gave " Batman Forever , " but I fail to see what is unimpressive about this . The story sees Prince Ahmed going on magical adventures with his flying horse , saving a beautiful princess and so on and so forth . It's the typical fantasy story told extremely well with visual craftsmanship that really makes this worth seeing alone . It's a silent film , only about an hour long , so it's an acquired taste . Film buffs will probably get more out of this than the average viewer , but I really enjoyed it .
Is " Yippee Ki Yay Mother " an Understatement ?	" Die Hard : With a Vengeance " is a full-blooded action vehicle ; it is a smart one , too , because its filmmakers realize the ol ' one - man - army - trapped - in - an - area routine can't last long . So they have changed the technique to a game of revenge ; cat-and-mouse . Some could call it smarter than its predecessors ; and on a level as a thriller I must admit it is more intense . It is a lot better than the 1990 Renny Harlin actioner " Die Hard 2 : Die Harder . " But on terms of fun , you can't beat the original . John McTiernan , who brought us " Predator , " " The 13th Warrior " and " Die Hard , " returned to end this series on a high note . Of course , like all sagas , " Die Hard " is far from over , with another sequel due to be released summer 2004 . But until then , we can look to " Die Hard : With a Vengeance " as the end-all to the overall excellent John McClane trilogy . The third film opens up where nothing left off ; McClane ( Bruce Willis ) is on the streets of NYC when a man who calls himself " Simon " blows up a Manhattan department store , and then orders McClane to stand in Harlem with a sandwich board that says . . . well . . . something you wouldn't want to be wearing in Harlem . After a convenience store owner named Zeus ( Samuel L . Jackson ) saves McClane , Simon orders both men to run around New York City and do Simon Says-type-games . It's all good fun , and a step away from the original film . Which can be good or bad . Soon McClane finds out that " Simon " is really the brother of Hans Gruber ( Alan Rickman ) from the first film , and that " Simon " is out for revenge against McClane ( or is he ? ) , and he will stop at nothing to kill McClane . But , of course , being a madman , he plays mind games with John McClane first . And the simon says mind games are tense , taught and action-packed . It's hard to compare something like this to the original for one major reason : It is nothing like the original . The original was about a lone man fighting off a million guys , Rambo-style . But what saved it from becoming another average action spectacular was the great dialogue , non-stop SMART action sequences , and engaging performences by all aboard the project . Fast-forward two years later and you've got a replicant copy of the first film set in Dulles airport in Washington , D . C . But in all respect , " Die Hard : With a Vengeance " is not recycled . Its technique is new , and it almost seems as if it is not a sequel to the other " Die Hard " films . Which is probably not too odd , seeing that the script , originally titled " Simon Says " ( no , not the Dennis Rodman one ) , was actually a sequel to " Lethal Weapon . " Of course , moderations were made after the " Die Hard " series bought out the script , but the character of Zeus was probably Danny Glover , and John McClane was probably Mel Gibson . Thinkabouddit . Bruce Willis is still John McClane . This film takes his character into a bit of a darker realm ; McClane now has an alcohol problem , and his wife has left him again . Man , you'd think after having your life saved TWICE by the same guy that MAYBE you should stick with him . In fact , we don't even see McClane's wife ( Bonnie Bedalia ) in this film at all . Notta . Zip . Although we are led to believe they will hook up again at the end . Just wait until the next film , I saw . Samuel L . Jackson adds some flair to the film , taking the movie into a more cop-buddy dimension ( " Lethal Weapon " ) . Jackson's character is a racist , and it's a bit odd to see a black racist in a film . It's usually those nasty white fellas . : ) I liked Jackson's character , because it provides for dialogue outlet on McClane's behalf , and sets the film up for some very funny sequences . The character interaction is a lot stronger here than it was in " Die Hard 2 : Die Harder . " " Die Hard : With a Vengeance " is hard to compare to the original because it is so very different . But the bottom line is that this sequel is much better than " Die Hard 2 : Die Harder , " but a step down from " Die Hard . " But seeing how different it is , you might think it is better than both the films . It really depends on your preferences . I give this solid action film a solid rating of stars - an all-around solid action sequel . Solid fun .
" Spielberg is back in form here , after the horrid ' Temple of Doom sequel . ' The Last Crusade ' brings Indy back to where he belongs , with deserts , Nazis , and the Indiana Jones ' feel . ' "	Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade ? Director : Steven Spielberg ? Starring : Harrison Ford , Sean Connery , John Rhys-Davies ? Co-Producer : George Lucas ? Indiana Jones is back in ' The Last Crusade , ' which , surprisingly enough , is not the last crusade , keeping in mind that there is a fourth film being filmed soon . Harrison Ford returns to the role of archeologist Dr . ' Indiana ' Jones , along with some old faces ( John Rhys-Davies ) as well as some new ( Indy's father , played by Sean Connery ) . In this sequel , Indiana Jones must find another ancient artifact ( a goblet ) before some Nazis do . After all , he is Indy . Unfortunately for him , the only man who can and must help him is his father , Sean Connery ( I think his name's Henry in the movie , but I honestly can't remember ) . Spielberg is back in form here , after the horrid ' Temple of Doom ' sequel . ' The Last Crusade ' brings Indy back to where he belongs , with deserts , Nazis , and the Indiana Jones ' feel . ' You see , the ' Temple of Doom ' sequel was so miserable because not only did they try to turn the Indy character into some sort of super-man , but they also tried some elements that just did not work . When I say this , I mean the sidekick ( ' Shortstuff ' ? a very forgettable ' pal ' ) , the location ( Some jungle out in Africa , was it ? ) , the plot ( Cults ? Wasn't the original film about artifacts ? Shouldn't they stick to what worked ? ) Et cetera ? This Indiana Jones movie , however , gets back on track , like I said before . It just ' feels ' more like an Indiana Jones movie . Harrison Ford is ( once again ) completely believable as Indiana Jones . As I said in my ' Raiders ? ' review ( which can be found on this same site ) , Ford's character is not as gungo-ho as the stereotypical adventure hero . We feel he carries out his missions with a smug smirk because he is ? simply ? Indiana Jones , and that is what he must do . Sean Connery is excellent as Indiana's father , completely convincing as an ex-adventurer who still has it in him for one last go as a daredevil . A Scottish father for Indy may seem a bit weird , but really , is it ? John Rhys-Davies returns to his ' Raiders ? ' role with a warm welcome ? he is still utterly loveable and moving as his character . And then there is young River Phoenix , who makes a small appearance in the beginning of the film as a teenaged Indiana Jones . I love the entire beginning sequence , because not only does it give us a glimpse into the background of the Jones character ( motivation behind it all , etc . ) but also , we find out how Indy got his nickname ( Phoenix walks into the Jones residence and we find out his pet dog's name is Indiana ) . And then there are the great locations , cinematography and excellent tongue-in-cheek gags that may not be as good as the original film , but to me , finalize the Jones chapter in concrete . That is why I am a bit sad to hear another sequel has been planned . It will be nice to see Indy again , but is it really necessary ? I think that at Ford's age ? sixty-something ? Ford will come across as more of a cripple than any hero . Still , I'll be one of the first in line to see it when it ( eventually ) comes out . I'd have to give ' Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade ' stars . ' Raiders of the Lost Ark ' gets , and ' Indiana ? Temple of Doom ' gets . Kudos to Spielberg , Lucas , Ford , Connery , Davies and Phoenix , plus all the others who made the trilogy what it is today . stars - John Ulmer
A Funny Little Family Film , Despite Predictability . . .	Howie Mandel and Fred Savage star in " Little Monsters , " a tale that features the " Monsters under the bed " delusions and reality . In 2001 , the world witnessed a great monster tale unlike any other : " Monster's Inc . , " a computer-animation film featuring the voice talents of Billy Crystal and John Goodman , as well as James Coburn and Steve Buscemi . " Monsters Inc . " achieved what " Little Monsters " was trying so obviously to do . Make a funny and endearing monster film . Unfortunately , due to too much " cuteness " and predictability , " Little Monsters " was sadly left to gather dust by most people . I'll admit , " Little Monsters " is nowhere near as fun , entertaining or smart as " Monsters Inc . , " but it still deserves more credit than it receives . So it's predictable and cute : I've seen worse . Howie Mandel is pretty funny , and Fred Savage is a lot better of a child actor than Macaulay Culkin ever was . I recommend " Little Monsters " to you , because despite its flaws , it's still a good , clean family film . stars - - John Ulmer
It would make Woody Allen proud .	Larry David is the co-creator / producer of the insanely popular television show " Seinfeld " ( started in 1990 ) . His name alone has earned him mega bucks , and when " Seinfeld " ended , he had nowhere left to go . ( Well , at least that's what the show leads us to believe , judging from his nonexistent job . ) So , he began his own reality TV series , named " Curb Your Enthusiasm . " At first , the summary seems rather lame , but once you realize the " reality " is almost entirely staged , it's a good deal more intriguing . Essentially the show follows Larry as his misadventures around Hollywood lead to embarrassing situations . All great comedies have setups and pay-offs ( ever notice how " Simpsons " episodes start off with plots that have NOTHING to do with the rest of the episode , but help lead into the main topic ? ) . " Curb Your Enthusiasm " has endless setups and pay-offs . Take Season One , for example . In the fourth or fifth episode ( " The Necklace " ) , Larry eats out with his good friend Richard Lewis , and when the bill comes , he notices that it includes an area to assign a tip to the " Captain . " Larry decides to give the waiter 30 % so he can split the tip with the Captain ( whose job title he scoffs at ) , then leaves . Later on , this pays off in a hilarious and awkward moment . Larry David , like Woody Allen , bases his comedy on existentialism and neurotics . This program is not " hilarious . " You will not fall out of your seat laughing ( at least not very often ) . It's more of an intellectual and subtle comedy , packed with less slapstick and more satire ; less sitcom-style simplicities and more real-life scenarios ( you'll find yourself often saying , " That happens to me ALL the time ! " ) . Larry's comedy is built upon quirky exchanges of dialogue and the inability to grasp basic concepts . In many of Allen's films he has brief arguments over inconsequential things , and Larry David does that quite often . Another good example is the episode " Ted and Mary , " where he goes bowling with Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen , and someone steals his shoes . His confrontation with the thief is classic . Overall , this isn't exactly the most hilarious program you'll find on TV ( if you're just looking to laugh , you can find easier viewing ) - but it's entirely prescient and you'll be able to easily relate to David and his misadventures in everyday life . If you enjoyed " Seinfeld , " or you like neurotic / existentialist comedy in general , " Curb Your Enthusiasm " is the way to go .
I loved this movie !	The 1994 film ' The Ref ' is absolutely hilarious . Denis Leary is great as Gus , a burglar who takes Lloyd Chasseur ( Kevin Spacey ) and Lloyd's wife Caroline ( Judy Davis ) hostage in their own home at Christmas , to hide himself from police . Unfortunately for Gus , this couple aren't exactly the Leave it to Beaver family . They rant and rave the whole way through the film , even though Gus is holding a gun to their head . Of course , we know Gus is would never hurt anyone but it's still funny because Lloyd and Caroline don't ! The acting is superb , and the ending is hilarious . The whole Christmas dinner scene is possibly the best in the film . Spacey and Davis sound like a real squabbling couple , and their character's son Jesse ( Robert J . Steinmiller Jr . ) is a teenage rebel , who causes Gus even more trouble . Not only does this film serve for side splitting laughs , but also for additional fun , because you can always point out that Lloyd and Caroline sound like you and your spouse ! ( Actually , no , not a good idea ! ) Overall , I really loved this movie , and think it's a sadly forgotten , underrated comic gem . You won't be disappointed !
Hard to imagine the cut footage making the film any better	Although " Citizen Kane " garnered strong reviews in 1941 , it did not recuperate much of its budget ( thanks largely to the efforts of William Randolph Hearst ) , so RKO Pictures pulled back on Welles ' creative liberties on his follow-up picture , " The Magnificent Ambersons . " Welles traveled to Brazil for the State Department , leaving the finished footage in the care of the RKO editor who had worked on " Citizen Kane . " While Welles was out of the country , RKO - after seeing a rough cut of the movie and despising it ( and fearing a bomb ) - demanded it be edited down without Welles ' approval . When Welles returned and realized what had happened , he was extremely upset and disowned the film . However , it was nominated for an Oscar , and years later remains one of his most memorable pictures . Welles does not appear but narrates the picture chronicling the lives of the Ambersons , an extremely wealthy family burdened with an arrogant and presumptuous " heir to the throne " of sorts . Joseph Cotten plays the ex-lover of the boy's mother , and when he returns to court her it sparks some tension . It doesn't help much that the Amberson son begins courting Cotten's daughter . Cotten delivers a strong performance but it is Tim Holt who really steals the movie . The performances are all-around strong and the direction is very fitting - you can tell Welles has learned a few things from " Kane . " The narration works well ( which I hadn't expected - narrations can usually be pretty terrible ) . This is overall one of the better films of Welles ' that I've seen and , although not as " classic " as Kane , it remains an underrated character piece that - despite Welles ' claims - actually works really well as is . I find it hard to imagine the extra footage that was cut could have improved it , although I suppose we'll never really know .
Rat Race proves , it's a mad , mad , mad , mad , world !	RAT RACE ( 2001 ) ( STARS ) StarringROWAN ATKINSON JOHN CLEESE WHOOPI GOLDBERG CUBA GOODING , JR SETH GREEN JON LOVITZ BRECKIN MEYER AMY SMART WAYNE KNIGHTDirected by JERRY ZUCKER Written by ANY BRECKMANFrom the very beginning of RAT RACE I knew it was going to be hilarious . The all-star comedic cast alone draws you to the movie , much less the jokes themselves . But let me tell you , the jokes did not fall flat at all . I don't know how many times I laughed , but it was countless . Unlike most comedies , RAT RACE delivers the whole way through , then has a HUGE comedy scene during an already funny movie ( a few in particular among many , such as the airport scene , the helicopter scene , The Lucy Bus and the Hitler scene . ) Basically a remake of the 1969 film IT'S A MAD , MAD , MAD , MAD , WORLD , the plot of the movie is a little different , and goes a little something like this : A billionaire tycoon named Donald Sinclair ( Cleese ) puts gold coins inside 6 slot machines in his hotel , to draw people on a game of his to be the first to get to Mexico City , and find a million dollars stored in a locker at a train station . First one there , wins it all . We find that a football referee ( Gooding ) who has made the worst call on a play in history , two money seeking brothers ( GREEN ) looking to sue the hotel , a mother ( Goldberg ) just reunited with her daughter she gave away years ago , a man taking his family on their first vacation in years ( Lovitz ) , an uptight young man ( Breckin Myer ) who finally takes a risk gambling one coin into a slot machine , and last but definitely not least a Frenchman named Enrico Polini ( Atkinson ) all find a coin . After being let in on Sinclair's game , at first they all say they won't go after the money . Then it begins . ALL of them rush away after the money , except Breckin Meyer's character , which leaves to take a flight home . On the way however , he meets a young female helicopter pilot ( AMY SMART ) who agrees to fly him to Mexico City , unaware of the little gamble . Later she is let in on the secret however , and she agrees to head to Mexico with him anyway . All the characters are completely loveable , especially Atkinson's . There're some famous cameos in this film as well , to name two are Kathy Bates and the band Smash mouth . There're a lot of interesting things about this film . One , is that it's the first to have two African-American actors in one movie together . Two , the character progression and introduction is done so well , it's incredible . It's truly amazing how good a comedy CAN be , and this is a good reference to look at if you're filming comedy . Another thing this comedy has , is the fact that while you're rooting for everyone , you wouldn't REALLY care if your character doesn't get the million . That's just the way the movie goes . And the end , unlike most comedies is truly great , and while a bit predictable what action the characters will take , we never guess HOW they do . If it's Donald Sinclair betting on who's going to throw up first , to your favorite characters doing wild and zany things , RAT RACE proves , it's truly a MAD , MAD , MAD , MAD WORLD , full of laughter and other great things , too many of which to wrap up in this comment !

Works on so many levels	DeVito is a hit-and-miss director . He's turned out some very good films and some very bad ones . Sometimes his satire just falls short ( " Death to Smoochy , " for example ) ; however , " War of the Roses " is his strongest directorial effort to date . It's got everything - a clever script , great interaction between its two stars , exciting thrills , funny gags ( without ever resorting to unnecessary crudity ) , and to top it all off , the direction is very effective - DeVito is heavily influenced by Hitchcock and that is very clear in the final sequence , which is reminiscent of " Vertigo " and " Rear Window . " Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner play the Rose couple - two once-happily-married people who are now , after many years together , bitter and at the end of their frustration . Deciding upon a divorce , they begin to split apart ; however , negotiations regarding belongings begin to go awry as Oliver Rose ( Douglas ) demands more from his wife , claiming it's his money that purchased their enormous house and all objects inside . DeVito turns in a performance as the narrator , and Oliver's lawyer , who tells us at the start we are about to watch a sad tale about divorce . By the time the film has ended we've seen events spiral totally out of control - beginning with absolute believability and ending in absolute absurdity . That's the crucial part of all this . Black comedy relies on whether the dramatic arc of the content - the leap from reality to lunacy - can be believable . Many times in DeVito's film , it isn't . " Smoochy , " for example , was clever satire at first , and fairly reminiscent of real-life people and events ; then it turned into an over-the-top revenge rampage . " War of the Roses " is more careful , and the arc is subtler . It's believable because the characters are given such room to grow and their conflict blossoms throughout the picture . I'd classify " War of the Roses " as one of the funniest , cleverest and most underrated black comedies of the 1980s - it's one of my personal favorite movies and never fails to crack me up . A cult film ? Maybe ; but I think many more people would enjoy it if they gave it a chance .
A masterpiece : One of the most beautiful movies ever put to film , both literally and otherwise .	" My Own Private Idaho " is a loose reworking of Shakespeare and stars . . . Keanu Reeves ? ! At first glance it seems to be a joke . River Phoenix in the lead role ? A film using classical dialogue set in modern day dealing with prostitution , bisexuality , homosexuality , heterosexuality , drugs , violence , and sex ? But it's more than just that . At its core " My Own Private Idaho " is a soft and delicate examination of a young man who doesn't have a place in life and is trying to find his way along the beaten path ; the road that stretches continually onwards , never ending . " I've been here before , " Mike ( Phoenix ) says to Scott Favor ( Reeves ) . He's speaking of the road before them . He isn't speaking literally , of course . But he's been there spiritually and mentally before . He knows he'll see it again , too . Gus Vant Sant was close to the material and based the characters on real men he knew in Portland , Oregon . Van Sant is a homosexual and perhaps that is why the subject matter - - fairly risqué and controversial even by today's standards - - was handled with such care , never seeming exploitative , but rather crucial and caring . It's a testament to the film's universal appeal that it was critically _ and _ publicly praised on release and , at least to my knowledge , did not create the wave of controversy that it easily could have . ( After all , it's a mainstream production centered around bisexual and homosexual street hustlers , and features on-screen orgasms and explicit - - or at least seemingly explicit - - freeze-frame sex scenes . After all , just remember the uproar " Midnight Cowboy " caused when it came out . ) What I remember most fondly about " My Own Private Idaho " is its truly beautiful photography and direction . The cinematography is one of the best examples of truly stunning visuals I've ever seen . The touching musical score only complements the outer layer . I won't lie : This film will not appeal to everyone . It is quite experimental and could understandably be criticized for its lengthy middle , which awkwardly transforms into a Shakespeare spin-off , and then - - in its last act - - returns to reality and abandons the stiff dialogue . Still , in my opinion , the Shakespeare elements are fairly important to the story and don't really harm it at all . The story , when stripped of its outer layers , is really just a tender story about the rites of passage of a young man . And love . Something we can all relate to , if we take away the specifics of the situation . River Phoenix is extraordinary in the lead role and in my opinion , " My Own Private Idaho " solidified his impressive talents as one of the generation's best young actors . And Keanu Reeves : All is forgiven . . . most stuff , anyway .
I can understand why peopl may dislike it , but I can't understand why people literally hate it - it's not all THAT strange . . .	The thin line between insanity and brilliance often amazes me . On one hand we have films like " Clifford , " the 1994 box office disaster starring Charles Grodin and Martin Short , that everyone claimed was one of the worst films of all time . Then we have the " Being John Malkovich " es , that are so strange and weird , yet everyone calls them masterpieces . What's the difference ? One is a comedy people went into expecting something straight-forward , and the other is a piece of art ? Puh-lease . The tagline for " Clifford " reads , " What's the difference between Clifford and a pit bull ? One will tear your heart out , scare your friends and wreck your house . The other one is a dog . " If you found that tagline funny , " Clifford " is for you . If not , then it is not for you . Personal taste comes into play here very much . I personally enjoy " Clifford . " Call me a horrible filmgoer , I don't care . It's just with all the crap I've seen in my days , " Clifford " is not only a pretty good movie when compared to others , but also a refreshingly naughty comedy . It unfortunately falls apart in the last ten minutes , really getting crazy . But then again , so did " Malkovich . " The film opens up in the year 2050 . A young troublemaker is trying to escape from a futuristic private school . He is stopped , however , by Father Clifford ( Martin ) , who looks like Dick Clark's lovechild with . . . well . . . Martin Short . Anyway , Clifford sits the boy down and teaches him a lesson . He tells him a story from when he was younger , and when he was a practical joker . More like a homicidal maniac . Clifford's story begins in present day . Clifford is now a small boy , but he is still played by Martin Short , oddly enough . At first he appears a normal enough child , happy and bright and just a bit overly creepy . Clifford and his parents are on a flight to Hawaii for business purposes . Clifford wants to land in LA to visit " Dinosaur World , " a theme park that I would have loved to visit when I was a dinosaur-crazy kid myself . Through Clifford's evil , creepy and manipulative ways , he gets into the cockpit and almost crashlands the plane . The pilot decides to land in LA to make sure the aircraft is unharmed . In LA , Clifford's parents drop him off with his Uncle Martin ( Charles Grodin ) , an aspiring architect , busy with his fiancee ( Mary Steenburgen ) and plans for a new Los Angeles subway route . His pesky boss ( Dabney Coleman ) is always on Uncle Martin's case , so he has barely enough time to devote to Clifford . Clifford's parents leave , they fly back to Hawaii , and Clifford gets anxious . He wants - or needs - to visit Dinosaur World as soon as possible , and Uncle Martin just keeps blowing him off . This makes Clifford mad . You may be wondering what happens when Clifford gets mad . In all truth , it's best not to spoil it . He doesn't turn green , he doesn't grow extremely large and bear muscles - he just unleashes ultimate havoc upon those opposing him . Take , for example , the scene where Clifford , mad at his Uncle Martin for going back on his word ( he said he'd take Clifford to Dino World and didn't ) , puts hot sauce in Uncle Martin's bloody mary , so that when Uncle Martin goes to propose a toast his throat gets a bit hoarse . Or when Clifford pieces together recordings of his uncle to make it sound as if he has a bomb planted under City Hall . Clifford is the ultimate pest , a spawn of Satan . Everyone knows someone like Clifford , but Martin Short stretches his character a bit more . Clifford is an odd child . He responds with gleeful joy and says things like , " Oh , yes , my dear Uncle Martin ! " We are supposed to sympathize with Clifford by the end of the film , but the problem is that we don't know how or what to sympathize with . Short makes Clifford more of a devil than a rascal , and we never truly get the sense that he is a human . By the end of the film , we're not all that sure if Clifford is human or not , or whether that evil streak is gone , and that is one of the film's flaws . Other than that , it's a general OK comedy . People don't seem to like it very much - at all - but I have seen much , much worse , and in all truth I actually laughed at this movie . More than once . Which is more than I can say for films like " Daddy Day Care . " Yep , " Clifford " is OK by me . stars -
An amazing expansion of the Half-Life 2 story	I've read some people criticizing Steam on places like Amazon - and giving the game poor reviews simply because of that - and in fact Steam hindered my enjoyment of the first game because it took so long to install and slowed down my computer . . . but if you can look past Steam and judge these games for what they are , they're amazing ! Originally planned to be an expansion pack called " Aftermath " ( I actually preferred that title ) , the video game makers at Valve decided to pull a George Lucas and release continual expansion-pack-like standalone games ( that is , you don't need Half-Life 2 to install this add-on - it's an add-on in story only ) . The Valve engine is upgraded a bit with better texturing , lighting and so on . The graphics in Half-Life 2 were amazing , but now it's even better - Dog's motion in the beginning is eerily realistic , as are the facial expressions of characters in the game ( one of the downsides of the realism of HL2 was its poor facial expressions for characters ; this game is fully textured and , for example , when Alyx smiles you can actually see her gradually move her lips - it's almost creepy ! ) . The game takes place right after the events of the last game and has Gordon and Alyx trying to escape the city before the core explodes . The first few levels are a nice twist because you have to complete them in pitch dark with a flashlight and a gravity gun . One thing I enjoyed about this game however was that Alyx stays by you most of the time unlike in the second game when she would suddenly disappear for silly reasons . It's more like a partnership and as such there is actually a good amount of character development in this game - making it a truly surreal experience for any video game ; I felt like the characters were real people , and even the dialogue isn't that bad most of the time ( although Barney is somewhat cheesy ) . The beginning is great , and the only mistake is that they start you off with the blue-powered ultra gravity gun and then downsize you to the regular gravity gun afterwards . It feels anti-climactic . I understand why they did this , but I would have preferred they just left it out at the beginning because once you are running around zapping people into the air , to suddenly be stuck with nothing is a bit sudden and disappointing . The middle goes on a bit too long and the level in the hospital gets old pretty fast . Other than that the rest of the game is basically superb and just as good as the last game , only shorter . There are a lot of " cut-scenes " where not much is happening - but I actually found them entertaining and made me feel more submersed into the game itself . The ending is fantastic and leaves you really wanting more . I can't wait for the next installment and I'm really , really glad Valve decided to release these in segments rather than having to wait , as they said , twelve years for Half-Life 3 . If you enjoyed HL2 , you'll love this - just be forewarned it only takes about five hours to complete . . . but what would you expect for $15 ? I think the price is worth the first level alone .
The best " Star Wars " film ever made .	( Note : This review contains some spoilers . ) Movie novelty quickly wears thin , which is why so many sequels pale in comparison to their originals . " Star Wars : Episode V : The Empire Strikes Back " is the best of the original " Star Wars " trilogy , darker and deeper and even more powerful than the first film . Granted , the original pioneered an endless saga of imitators and somewhat imaginative knock-offs , and is still one of the greatest films ever made , but " The Empire Strikes Back " is a tiny inch ahead in the race . It is the dark middle chapter in an almost perfect trilogy , crammed full with imagination and special effects . It is simply one of the most visionary movies of all time , which is rare for a sequel - - any sequel - - especially in the case of a sci-fi film . Just take a look at " Predator 2 " for an example of an idea running out of steam , or a director who cannot cope with his script . The film generally picks up where the last left off : Luke ( Mark Hamill ) saved the day by blowing up the Death Star , the heroes were awarded with medals by the princess ( Carrie Fisher ) , and peace was temporarily restored . But Darth Vader ( voice of James Earl Jones ) is still alive , and the Emperor's fury grows stronger as Luke begins his Jedi training under the help of Yoda . Meanwhile , Han Solo ( Harrison Ford ) and Leia flee to Cloud City to escape an attack from the empire , where they are taken under the wing of Lando Calrissian ( Billy Dee Williams ) , an old pal of Han's who is secretly working for Vader , somewhat against his own will . The movie is strong in its morals and Biblical metaphors , just as the original . Luke is the savior , Calrissian could be considered the equivalent of Judas , Han Solo is one of Luke's good disciples and Vader represents pure evil . And of course , there's the truly iconic line , " I am your father , " that is relevant to the devil , who - - according to the scriptures - - was an angel before being cast into the bowels of hell and becoming Lucifer . Lucas admittedly used these various metaphors to strike a nerve in the subconscious of his viewers . Like all good fables , of fantasy or reality , " Star Wars " is a trilogy that relates to just about everyone , in one form or another , and is - - at its roots - - a story we are all very familiar with . It is the ever-familiar notion of good-vs . - evil at its core that helps propel these movies into the hearts of many . Yes , " Star Wars " is the quintessential nerd's film , engulfed in an entirely different dimension , but the film's bad rap for this is undeserved - - it's still a wonderful story , and you don't have to be a die-hard fan to appreciate its fine points ( and it has many ) . One of the most popular legends ( and misconceptions ) regarding the " Star Wars " phenomenon is that George Lucas helmed the entire Star Wars trilogy , when in fact he only directed the first and wrote the screenplay for all three combined . " The Empire Strikes Back " is directed by Irvin Kirshner , who also delivered us the disappointing " RoboCop 2 . " How could one sequel be so great , and the other so bad ? Simple : Kirshner's darkness in " The Empire Strikes Back " had a point , and a high value . In " RoboCop 2 , " it was just excessive and silly , not to mention totally unnecessary . What Paul Verhoeven was able to do with the original " RoboCop " was something not many films can accomplish , and Kirshner tried to add on to this with a darker narrative , which only ended in a frustratingly empty motion picture . " The Empire Strikes Back " has a point amidst the action , and is the most important of all three " Star Wars " movies . It has the famous introduction of the creature Yoda , who sits tucked away in his hut on a swamp planet , at first startling Luke with his strange features , and then with his subtle wisdom . It is Yoda who trains Luke in the ways of the Jedi , and eventually leads him towards his destination : The showdown with Vader , when the infamous secret is finally revealed . The movie is expertly crafted , both in terms of a a narrative and literal context . From beginning to end it is darker , fiercer and more powerful than the original film , which is not an easy feat . All trilogies have their dark areas , and this is usually the middle chapter ( " Back to the Future Part II " is a good example ) , yet in " The Empire Strikes Back " the darkness seems very appropriate given the material . It is a film that dwells long and hard on betrayal , murder , revenge , and unrecoverable mistakes . By the end of the movie , we know what Luke is feeling : There is still much to be done , despite an overwhelming emotional downpour of attachment and confusion . For us , as an audience , we know everything must come to an end within the next installment . For Luke , it could be an eternity of struggle . But we all know there will be an end to the epic saga , and we have always known this , ever since we first caught a glimpse of a younger , more innocent Luke working for his uncle on that deserted planet , so many years ago , when he could only dream of having adventures in other galaxies far , far away . . . stars . - John Ulmer
" Would you just watch the hair ? I work a long time on my hair , and you hit it ! " - Tony Manero .	I love this movie . I love the way it focuses on dancing , yet it isn't about dancing at all . Yes , long amounts of time are given to showing John Travolta light up the dance floor , but the story's fundamental point is the most subtle : Trying to escape from your boring daily routine , even if it is just for an hour . That's exactly what Tony Manero does . He saves up his weekly earnings from where he works in downtown Brooklyn at a crummy hardware store , then blows it all in one day at the local disco joint , where he reigns as king . His female dance partner calls him a walking cliché . In a sad sort of way , it's true . But this is Tony's dream . I quote an aspiring comedian named Rupert Pupkin : " Better to be king for a night than a schmuck for a lifetime . " " Saturday Night Fever " is based entirely on this idea . In an odd sort of way , Rupert Pupkin is a lot like Tony Manero . He just has a different dream . We all do . " Saturday Night Live's " theme tune , " Staying Alive " ( the title of the horrendous Sylvester Stallone-directed sequel ) , speaks as much truth about life as the film itself . " I'm goin ' nowhere , somebody help me , I'm goin ' nowhere , somebody help me yeah " chants a voice in the Bee Gee's universally known disco hit . As I listen to it right now , I realize just how perfect it is for the movie . It's a legendary song , and for good reason . I didn't grow up during the disco generation . But " Saturday Night Fever " makes me feel as if I had - - and that is one of the fundamental keys to a film so incredibly outdated and yet still poignant in our memories . It was the film that solidified John Travolta as an icon , and the film that eventually led to him being regarded as the King of Cinema Disco . ( In the Travolta film " Get Shorty , " a criminal threatens a producer by saying that , if he doesn't pay up , he'll be " dead as disco . " Ironic . ) Travolta is in his prime spotlight as Manero , a Brooklyn kid aiming to make it big on the dance floor . There isn't much to the movie other than the need for fame - - as brief as it may be - - and the most obvious theme of the film , which is learning to treat women as something more than just sex objects . Tony and his pals all join together at 2001 Odyssey , a crummy disco club with dizzying strobe lights and a constantly-waxed dance floor where Tony is often encouraged to let loose and show everyone his moves . When he's not doing that , he's sitting at the bar watching a topless stripper do her thing . And he's only 19 . Part of this movie is learning to grow up , and treat women as something more than Tony is used to treating them . But that's one of two primary plots - - the other is , of course , trying to break away from a boring life . Tony comes from an Italian background , and he lives in a bad area of town . His mother is proud of her eldest son , who became a priest , and she's discouraged by the fact that her other son doesn't seem to care about making anything out of his life . We get the feeling that Tony's parents once had the same outlook as their son , and fear he may be going down their own path . After Tony gets a raise from $3 to $4 , his father tells him that $4 can't even buy $3 . His son swears at him and storms away . Some of my favorite scenes in " Saturday Night Live " are the human ones , such as when Tony stares in his bedroom mirror , bare-chested , and combs his hair forever , looking over himself with the same pride that Travis Bickle displayed in the famous " You talkin ' to me ? " scene in " Taxi Driver , " released a year earlier . In the background of the shot are posters of Al Pacino from " Serpico " and Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa . ( Just think , Sly directed the sequel and did a cameo , yet he was , in a way , in the first film , too . ) I also like when Tony is interacting with his dysfunctional family . He's nice to his little sister when he walks through the door after work , but after working for quite some time on his now-out-of-date hairstyle , he barks at his father when he is slapped during dinner ( in one of the rare scenes that made me laugh ) . He yells at him : " Would you just watch the hair ? I work a long time on my hair , and you hit it ! " I know that scene has been quoted before , but I quoted it again since it made me laugh so hard . In one of the finest scenes in the entire movie , and certainly one of the most touching , Tony has lunch with an older girl ( who later becomes his dance partner ) and tries to impress her by acting mature . But his immaturity shines through - - he doesn't have a clue what he's talking about half the time , and when he tries to act smart she counters his moves with true brainpower . In a way , this is the first time Tony realizes that women aren't as dumb as he thought they were . This is one of my favorite guilty pleasures for all the right and wrong reasons . The wrong reasons include the dance floor numbers - - I love them , and I probably shouldn't . As for the right reasons . . . I think we already know what they are . It's all about dreams . Everyone has some . Whether it's dancing or whatever , we all have dreams . And that's why I think " Saturday Night Fever " relates to so many different people on so many different levels .
One of the great films , if not " the " greatest .	MINOR SPOILER IN SECOND PARAGRAPH . " Citizen Kane " is , without a doubt , one of the greatest American films ever made . Orson Welles was basically handed the keys to the city - he had everything he wanted and complete control over budget , actors , script , and more . He plays Charles Foster Kane , who dies at the beginning of the film while uttering the immortal words " Rosebud . " So the film starts off by searching for what " rosebud " really means . We see countless relations of Kane interviewed . None of them know what " rosebud " really means . But as the film goes on we see glimpses of Kane's life , and eventually the mystery unfolds itself . Like Akira Kurosawa's " Ikiru , " " Citizen Kane " is a glance at a man's life and what has driven him to bitterness . Kurosawa claims he never saw " Citizen Kane " before making his film , but nevertheless they form a nice back-to-back viewing . " Citizen Kane " has , perhaps , some of the best makeup ever seen on film . A twenty-four-year-old Orson Welles is easily disguised as a sixty-something , overweight man . ( And this was before he actually WAS overweight later in his life . ) I recently bought the Special Edition DVD with a commentary by Roger Ebert , who said in his commentary that there are probably more special effects in " Citizen Kane " than in the " Star Wars " films . Though subtle , I have to agree that there truly are many special effects used in the film . They're so flawless it's hard to even notice . Another thing Ebert pointed out is how low the ceilings are , which creates a feeling of paranoia . All these things work on a subconscious level that you don't really pick up on the first time . And if you want symbolism , this film is for you . As Kane hands over his empire in one scene , he walks over to a window , which to the naked eye looks normal-sized . But as Kane nears the window , guess what ? Turns out the window is very , very high . It makes Kane look small . Think about it . He's handing over his empire and growing smaller in his wealth . It's all very symbolic . I recommend picking up the DVD ; it also contains a two-hour documentary called " The Battle Over Citizen Kane , " plus many , many more tidbits , including the original theatrical trailer ( which is very odd and original ) . All in all , " Citizen Kane " is a classic of epic proportions . One of the very greatest American films out there .
A brilliant masterpiece from a masterful director	" Rashomon " was Akira Kurosawa's first national hit ( becoming , at the time , the highest-grossing foreign film in America ) and even gained an Oscar for Best Foreign Film , but almost sixty years later it still hasn't lost any of its impact . It is widely revered as one of the most influential films of all-time , but unlike some other movies , it is not a film that feels dated . The revolutionary methods of Kurosawa are still effective and on-par with the cinema of today - - this isn't a movie where you say , " Yeah , fifty years ago it might have been different , but now it's done in all the movies . " Kurosawa's techniques are still superior to most of his imitators . Look at the 2003 John McTiernan film , " Basic , " which copies a good portion of " Rashomon's " concept . Which is the better film ? It's not a hard choice . The film begins under a structure which reads " Rashomon " on its exterior , in a small Japanese village . It's raining outside and a woodcutter ( Takashi Shumura ) and a priest ( Minoru Chiaki ) inadvertently find themselves in the company of a wandering commoner ( Kichijiro Ueda ) , and as he asks them what is the matter they both begin to relay the most horrific story they claim to know - - of a brutal murder a few days prior . Kurosawa then switches to flashback and we see three different versions of the exact same event - - the slaying of an innocent man ( the murderer played by Kurosawa film regular Toshirô Mifune ) in the woods outside the village . Was it because of lust ? Betrayal ? Envy ? Or insanity ? We hear from the murderer , the wife of the victim , and a woman channeling the spirit of the dead man . " Rashomon " is brilliant . Some people have complained that the ending is a cop-out and sentimental hogwash , but I think Kurosawa was fond of sentimentality to a point ( he uses a good deal of it in " Ikiru " ) but the difference between what he does with sentimentality as opposed to many filmmakers of today is that he uses to to ENRICH the story , not provide an easy solution to all the problems . Is there resolution in the finale of " Rashomon " ? To a degree . But , like " Ikiru , " it also leaves an open answer to its audience - - this film questions us , and our humanity , and it says something about the human condition and our weaknesses as a species . Yet it also proposes that along with the evil is an inherent good , and in my opinion the message of " Rashomon " is just as important and effective as its film-making techniques and acting .
An excellent fim . If any film deserves to be higher up on the top 250 , it's this film !	SLING BLADE is a truly incredible film . Billy Bob Thornton does his bestacting ever . He truly fits into character . If any movie at all deservesto be higher up on the top 250 on IMDB , it's SLING BLADE . I mean , ifAMELIE is number 12 on the 250 . . . man . . . AMELIE was weird anyway-how'dit get to # 12 ? ? ? ? ? Go rent SLING BLADE on DVD . Though it has no specialfeatures on the DVD , it's much better than viewing on VHS . stars .
One of the best films of the decade and also one of the most important	The first time I saw " Fight Club " I despised it . I found its message stupid and contradictory - it was a hypocritical film that preached against violence yet was more violent than any other recent films including " The Matrix " ( which is not quite as realistic as " Fight Club " ) . I saw it again on television a few years later and thought it was a bit better and not quite as horrible , but still didn't enjoy it much . However I was convinced into buying the DVD and seeing it again just because it had been rated the 37th best film of all time on IMDb ( it's now # 41 ) . Well I'm happy to report that I found " Fight Club " utterly brilliant on third viewing . Since then I've seen it more than a handful of times on DVD and it just gets better each time . Brad Pitt gives a fantastic performance as one of the coolest cinema icons of all time : Tyler Durden ( whose name is a reference to Travis Bickle of " Taxi Driver " - according to something I read the first name is harsh , the last name simple and soft ) . Edward Norton gives an Oscar-worthy performance as The Narrator , " Jack , " whose actual name isn't ever truly revealed . ( Many people don't seem to notice this . ) I won't go into the plot and won't go into a deep analysis because so many other people have done it so well . Suffice to say it IS a very violent movie but I find its style infectious and David Fincher's direction wonderful . It is a brutal and weird film and sometimes it is a bit too pretentious and clever for its own good - I won't lie and say that it's flawless and I totally understand why so many critics bagged on it for being " a laborious dog " on its initial release . The British DVD includes a mocking pamphlet where the filmmakers brag about how they all knew it was going to be great from the start and I think this is a bit too masturbatory - the fact that they include critics ' negative reviews as a mockery is humorous but childish , and I can understand why some might view " Fight Club " as a very childish , contradictory film . ( After all , I used to think the same thing . ) However I really have come to love it despite its flaws . I think Tyler Durden is one of the absolute coolest characters of all time and Pitt plays him so well it's scary . Norton embodies the Bored Working Repressed Everyman flawlessly . Fincher is great behind the camera . And the film's message strikes a chord nowadays when I watch it - it is a bit contradictory and some of the violence really isn't needed , but then again I'm not going to complain because I've never really cared too terribly much about violence in films so I'm not going to start now . Overall this is one of the most important films of the 1990s and its message was missed by a lot of people ( myself included ) back in 1999 . In a year of some really good movies " Fight Club " was probably the best and is one of my all-time favorite films . It's easy to see how this might be considered the next " Taxi Driver " thirty years from now .
One of the most engaging and impressive character pieces I've seen all year	" The Prestige " got some bad reviews early on , and at one point it was listed on RottenTomatoes . com with less than 30 % fresh rating . I went to see it , as a result , with mixed expectations . On one hand , I think Christian Bale is the next great method actor and I firmly believe Christopher Nolan is on the pathway to really carving out a name for himself in Hollywood ( beyond the fanboy audiences ) . He's still being advertised as " The Director of Memento and Batman Begins " but soon it will just be " From Director Christopher Nolan . " As for the film ? Exceptional . Inventive , unique and twisted . Bale and Hugh Jackman deliver career-making performances . It's by far Jackman's best performance on film ( in a serious role ) and one of Bale's best , which is saying a lot . This guy can do anything . It's amazing to see him in " The Machinist " a few weeks ago and then turn around and see him here . Within the past year alone he's moved up many ranks in my book . ( Of course , I don't have a book . But if I did . . . ) The film is dark , and its blend of reality with sudden fantasy may throw some viewers off . But I don't think it's a cop-out , as some people have claimed . It's just Nolan's style . Batman incorporated many different genres and themes that one wouldn't necessarily expect from , of all things , a Batman film - and here The Prestige delivers some magical material that I didn't see coming . Even knowing the ending ahead of time ( after it was ruined by an ignorant IMDb user who thought it would be funny to spam people with the ending ) , it still came as a shock in delivery . What I finally felt so satisfied with was the film's direction , acting and character development . With a lesser director it could have easily been a lame exercise in style over substance and a flashy , gimmicky ending . Nolan elevates it and the two lead performances are really engaging . It works as a morality tale as well as an intense character study that has you alternately rooting for both men to succeed . And the film changes perceptions of past events so often that by the end you're kind of sitting there , shocked that it's played out so vastly different than what was expected . Chilling , gripping movie . Had me consistently engaged from beginning to end , and I'd say in some ways it's the most well-made Nolan film yet .
One of Kubrick's best	To say that the Alex character from Stanley Kubrick's " A Clockwork Orange " is unlikable is like saying the Manson family was sort of bad . He's not just unlikable ; he's despicable , terrifying , sick , twisted , and ultimately a haunting embodiment of all our greatest realistic fears and worries . But Alex does not see himself as a sick person . The key to this is in his voice-over narrative . Alex does not see himself as a pervert , just as we do not see our own flaws and Ramond Babbitt did not see his own autism . To us , we are all normal , which is a scary thought . " A Clockwork Orange , " which was originally released in 1973 after an appeal for an R rating ( that was granted after originally being tagged as an X-rated motion picture ) , had been banned from Britain for close to thirty years . Most film fans in Europe will tell you that they had seen the movie on grainy bootleg videotapes years ago when they were young and curious . But for those of us lucky enough to enjoy ( or squirm through ) " A Clockwork Orange " in its entire odd splendor , it is an experience you are likely to never forget . Its characters , its style , its subject matter , its explicit material - - all of it combines to create a marvelous whole that will stay with you long after the credits stop rolling . Essentially a tale focused on Alex's journeys in jail and his process of being re-submitted to the world after inhumane treatments to cure the evil out of him , " A Clockwork Orange " is indeed as offbeat as its title . All tales of redemption involve characters that we gradually come to appreciate , or like , or - - at the very least - - learn to tolerate . Not " A Clockwork Orange . " Our narrator remains the same throughout the movie , always an incarnation of everything wrong in today's modern world . He goes through no cleansing process and by the end of the film we like him less than we did at the beginning . That's daring .
D Day for Pacino	By the time Sidney Lumet's " Dog Day Afternoon " came around he had already learned to let Al Pacino loose . Forget the holdbacks of " Serpico " ; here we get a glimpse into the real Al , the actor who would bring Tony Montana to life in the years to come and the same man who provided Michael Corleone with such heartfelt warmth that was lacking in some of his lesser characters . There's essentially the Al Pacino as an actor and the Al Pacino as a character , and here he's the character , and it works splendidly . Al Pacino the actor comes into play when he is given a recycled script and a talentless director , which has been happening a lot lately , although fortunately his comparison , De Niro , has been lucky enough to generally avoid these blunders of older-age film-making . This is based on a true story , like " Serpico , " only it's better and more involving . It connects with the audience more than " Serpico " because it doesn't jump through the same old hoops ; it goes for the long trek and comes off better than it would have had the team behind it been lazy . The clichés are gone and the originality creeps in early on . Watch Pacino indulge himself in character and let the plot sink in . It's more touching than it seems at first . Pacino is Sonny Wortzik , a Brooklyn man who takes a bank hostage in order to pay for his " wife's " operation . The wife is actually Leon Shermer ( Chris Sarandon who was Oscar-nominated for this , his first role in a mainstream film ) , Sonny's gay lover who doesn't have the money for a sex operation . The bank robbery was going to be what one of classic cinema's greatest bad guys once described as a quick " in and out , " but Sonny gets held up inside the bank and soon he's all over the news and police are standing outside the building with guns drawn . It's like Denzel's movie only better and more original . Oh , and true . This one actually happened and we can tell . Sonny's partner in crime , Sal ( John Cazale ) , is worried that he'll be treated as a homosexual by the media outside . His fretting is comic relief and one of the connections between the film and the audience . Charles Durning is the frustrated cop handling the situation . His performance is as subtly convincing as Cavale's . Pacino's performance is exceedingly excellent , manic and energetic . He'd display this same talent in " Scarface " again eight years later ; only he would be bashed by the critics for going over-the-top . ( Although they really just had problems with the excessive profanity and violence , just like Mel Gibson's " The Passion of the Christ " will soon become a well-known classic and people will laugh when they hear that someone once called it the most violent film ever made . ) There's also one of the best scenes of all time in this movie that rivals Montana's Last Stand in " Scarface " or the Baptism Scene in " The Godfather , " which involves Sonny speaking on the phone to his " wife , " carefully concealing his motive from any listeners nearby . Watch Pacino delve into character here and you're immediately hooked . We like his character because he seems real and Pacino makes him real , and that's why this will go down as one of the best tour de force performances of all time . Is this Hollywood trying to ease our culture onto homosexuality and sex change operations ? Is Hollywood trying to gradually introduce us to gay characters in the hope that the uptight American families will be increasingly invaded by the images of gay men ? No . This is Hollywood showing us a true story , regardless of the homosexuality . Pacino could be playing a frustrated postal worker and it would still work because it all settles down to the fact that the suspense and dramatics of the movie affect us , not the background of its characters . Sarandon's Oscar nomination was more than worthy ; here he displays the smarmy talent that would shine through in his characters in the years to come . Prince Humperdink from " The Princess Bride " is equally memorable but less realistic . Here he seems more real , which is good for this film and would have been quite bad for " Bride . " We don't like real characters in fantasy tales , do we ? Lumet , who ruined " Serpico " with his bad editing , out-of-place music , clichéd dialogue / events and unnecessary scenes , directs " Dog Day Afternoon " with style and flair and good pacing and a surprisingly heartfelt sense of emotion and care . This isn't exactly a good example of a perfect motion picture but it's pretty close .
