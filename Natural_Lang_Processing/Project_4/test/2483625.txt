We all have to start somewhere	The miracle out of all this is that Lou Diamond Phillips actually had a career after this one . And since he co-wrote it , he's got more responsibility than as a player only . It's just bad , bad directing , lousy photography and acting that's about the level of a high school play . How did they ever rope Ben Johnson into that small role as the leading lady's father ? Two drifters , Lou Diamond Phillips and Adam Roarke who was Lou's acting teacher and mentor , come to town and wreak havoc , killing one man's son and raping the leading lady . The husband of the leading lady unbeknownst to all , saw the whole thing and did nothing . Sharing in a joint tragedy , the rape victim and the man draw close and begin an affair . That leads to some rather bizarre consequences . Good thing Lou , went on to much better things .
Did They Know About Lucky Luciano's Contribution To The War Effort	I see so far I'm in a minority here for some folks are finding all kinds of murky and mysterious meanings in Tomorrow We Live . All I'm looking at is a Grade Z piece of melodramatic claptrap . Poor Ricardo Cortez's career had come to a pretty pass here for a guy who was the last player billed OVER Greta Garbo back in silent days . And a rival in the Latin lover department to Rudolph Valentino besides . Cortez's character ' the Ghost ' is a veiled reference to Lucky Luciano who got his nickname by surviving a hit attempt as did Cortez . He's got himself a nice little gambling spot out on the desert in some unnamed western state that I think we can assume is Nevada . He's got the hots for Jean Parker and he's also got a hold on her father Emmett Lynn who runs a nearby truck-stop greasy spoon like caf√© . The kind that Cecil Kellaway had in The Postman Always Rings Twice . Anyway Cortez has Lynn working in a black market tire racket and Parker submitting herself to his Snidely Whiplash advances . She actually throws over her all American soldier boyfriend William Marshall for Cortez . But Marshall tells off Cortez that he's going overseas to fight guys like him . Anyway the film was made too soon because Lucky Luciano due to efforts by the War Department got himself paroled and deported to Cuba for allegedly setting up contacts with the Italian Mafia for OSS operatives in Italy . That came after Tomorrow We Live was inflicted on the movie going public which does give this film a certain amount historical curiosity . But definitely not worth the little over an hour of my life I'll not get back .
Flirting With Pneumonia	When Allan Jones had to do Moonlight In Havana , he must have cursed the day he decided to leave MGM because he didn't want to be behind Nelson Eddy all the time . He also must have wondered what happened to the studio where in fact he had done Showboat and The Boys From Syracuse . This is one of the dumbest plots I've ever seen done for a musical and with one exception , the score of original songs by Dave Franklin is singularly unmemorable . Jones is a baseball catcher who has broken training for the last time and is on suspension . But agent William Frawley has heard him sing and wants him to pursue another career . There's an interesting medical condition that Jones has that I will say I've never seen in another film . That magnificent tenor only emerges when he's got a cold . So in order to induce the voice , he's constantly trying to catch cold throughout the film . Besides being medically impossible , the idea of this man flirting with pneumonia to hit a few high Cs is beyond stupid . Of course to play baseball for the Blue Sox , he's got to be in good shape . Besides the career choices Jones is also caught between two women , singer Jane Frazee and ballclub owner's daughter Marjorie Lord . If you're interested in seeing who he winds up with you are condemned to sit through the little more than an hour running time of Moonlight In Havana . In the days before Castro , Havana was a popular place for the major leagues to appear and to do training . The Dodgers trained there until their complex at Vero Beach , Florida was opened . I'm betting that Allan Jones probably had the producer's interpolate the public domain song of I Wonder Who's Kissing Her Now into the score for him to sing . It's a particular favorite of mine and the highlight of a bad film and Jones really does this most simple and basic of love ballads real justice . But it's not enough to save this film .
Just what did Ava's Grandma do that was so terrible ?	My Forbidden Past has Ava Gardner as decadent New Orleans belle living with her great aunt Lucile Watson and her cousin Melvyn Douglas . She's got a yen for Yankee doctor Robert Mitchum who is doing research over at Tulane University . They break things off and Mitchum goes away and returns with a bride , slatternly Janis Carter . In the meantime Ava inherits a whole bunch of money from her grandmother who left New Orleans years ago under a cloud . Just what she did is never revealed , but her name is spoken in hushed tones . Whatever she did , she sure got rich at it . It kind of reminds me of The Road to Rio where we never do find out what those papers were that foiled the dastardly schemes of Gale Sondergaard to marry off Dorothy Lamour . As Bing concludes about the " papers " the world must never know . This film was conceived so that Howard Hughes who was crushing out on Ava Gardner big time at that point could get her over to RKO . He paid Louis B . Mayer's price and Mayer apparently threw in Melvyn Douglas . Melvyn Douglas knows full well what a clinker this is so he overacts outrageously in the best Snidely Whiplash tradition of screen villains . He's the best one in the film . My Forbidden Past should come with a warning label that if you manage to sit through this melodrama because you want to find out just what Ava's forbidden past was with grandma , you will be left hanging .
Road Gangs for Wayward Youth	Heart of the Rockies is one of two films that Republic Pictures put out with this title . The first was a Three Mesquiteer film with Max Terhune , Crash Corrigan , and Bob Livingston . It was infinitely superior to this Roy Rogers epic . I sincerely hope that this film did not play in any of the prisons because if it did there would have been a riot . The premise of this film is that a crusty local rancher , Ralph Morgan , has been violently against a work camp for young prisoners cutting through his land . Roy Rogers is the chief engineer for the road and the labor he's using is young first offender convicts . The idea behind it is the director of the camp is a former warden William Gould says it's to keep the young guys in the fresh air and away from the hard cases . If the camp closes down the government might actually have to pay civilian workers and the road might never get done . Well it's certainly an interesting take on the penal system and a defense for using convict labor . Of course such films as Brubaker take a much different line . And my idea of a convict road gang is best expressed cinematically by Cool Hand Luke . Anyway Morgan's got troubles in his own house . His niece Penny Edwards has taken a real shine to Roy . And he's got a doubledealing , doublecrossing foreman in Fred Graham who both has something on Morgan and is working his own agenda . I don't expect much from the B westerns and don't usually get it , but this film actually left me aghast . I wonder if Robert Mitchum who actually did time on a road gang ever saw this film and what he must have thought .
Cortes In The Land Of The Lost	I'll bet none of you knew that the famous Conquistador Hernando Cortes made a preliminary scouting expedition to Mexico before taking on the Aztecs . Good thing he did because he would never have known about those T Rexs that inhabited one particular valley where the locals revered them as gods . That was understandable . What wasn't was the casting of blue eyed Ian Ziering as Cortes . Even with the blond hair made famous in Beverly Hills 90210 dyed black , Ian looked positively ridiculous . At least he made no attempt at a Spanish accent . The real hero of Tyrannosaurus Azteca is Marco Sanchez also late of a television series with a semi-recurring role in Walker Texas Ranger as Detective Sandoval of the Dallas PD . He finds true love with an Aztec princess and life would be just perfect if it wasn't for those pesky prehistoric beasts the natives worship . Tyrannosaurus Azteca looks like they used some outtakes from the famous Sid & Marty Krofft series the Land of the Lost . All that was needed was some Sleestak to appear . If you're interested in finding out about this reconnoitering expedition that didn't quite make the history books by all means check out Tyrannosaurus Azteca . Then try and sit through it with a straight face .
What Mystery Does It Hold ?	Mystery Mountain is a 12 part Mascot Pictures serial where silent movie cowboy Ken Maynard is trying to track down a nefarious criminal called the ' Rattler ' . This dude who when he's not walking around posing as other cast members with life like masks is busy trying to get a feud going between a railroad and a freight wagon outfit that's owned by leading lady Verna Hillie . The railroad is busy digging a tunnel into a mountain where the ' Rattler ' has a vested interest . But sent to get to the bottom of all this is range detective Ken Maynard together with a sidekick , newspaperman Syd Saylor , looking for a scoop as all good newspapermen do . Maynard's horse Tarzan has absolutely nothing on Trigger , in fact I think Tarzan ought to ask for a recount or demand to know when the election was held that named Trigger the smartest horse in the movies . He pulls Maynard's gluteus maximus out of the proverbial sling a few times in Mystery Mountain . In fact Tarzan's the one who finally after 12 chapters identifies who the ' Rattler ' really is beneath those disguises as other cast members and going around in a Phantom of the Opera like disguise for most of the film . I won't give it away , but the hint for the viewer who wants to sit through the four hours of this serial is : think The List of Adrian Messenger and how they nailed Kirk Douglas in that one . By the way do you it's possible that John Huston and the writers who worked on The List of Adrian Messenger got inspired by Mystery Mountain ? If you look at the cast list of Mystery Mountain you will note the names of Gene Autry and Smiley Burnette . Both in fact were brought to Hollywood by Ken Maynard who met them in Chicago when he was doing a personal appearance tour and they were doing radio . This was the second of two serials they did literally learning the picture business , courtesy of Ken Maynard . According to a recent biography of Autry , Public Cowboy Number 1 , when Hollywood had totally abandoned Ken Maynard and he was living in poverty in a trailer park , Gene Autry sent him regular checks until the day Maynard died to keep him literally in eating money . Maynard was not the nicest guy in the world , but at least one man was grateful for a kindness shown . I will say this for Mystery Mountain , at least it did attempt to rewrite history as some serials I've seen did . It's a Mascot film so don't expect too much /
Self Indulgent Brat	William Richert directed and wrote the novel as a youngster on which A Night In The Life Of Jimmy Reardon is based . Sad to say he failed to capture whatever charm there was in the book for his lead character . As River Phoenix plays him , Jimmy is spoiled , hedonistic , self-indulgent , and a liar . Maybe he should have gone into politics . Richert wrote the book in the Sixties and that's where the film is set , a rich suburb of Chicago . Phoenix as Jimmy Reardon is spoiled kid who has sex more on his mind than anything else , not atypical for someone his age . He's a chick magnet even when he's not trying . What this one wants to do is somehow get an airline ticket to Hawaii where he believes he can be a beachcomber and live off tourists . His father , Paul Koslo , wants him to go to school or get a job , the nerve of the man . So Phoenix hatches this scheme to somehow get enough money in the next 24 hours to fly to Hawaii or its either , the street , a job , or school . That is if the women can leave him alone , which apparently they can't . Including one cougar who is deliciously played by Ann Magnuson , she's the best thing in the film . River Phoenix's fans usually consider this one of , if not the worst film of his short career . I'm inclined to agree with them . River is certainly sexy enough in this film , but he's so incredibly dislikeable in this part .
Where WAS that base anyway ?	Tyrone Power's last film before going to war was this World War II epic which co-starred him with Dana Andrews and Anne Baxter and a good cast of supporting players . This did win an Oscar for Special Effects with the raid on the Nazi Submarine base . And that's what makes this thing so stupid . Where was that base ? Given what World War II vintage subs could do in performance , that base had to be Block Island , Martha's Vineyard or at worst , the Grand Banks of Newfoundland . You're asked to believe that the Nazis constructed a secret submarine base somewhere on some mythical isle in the Atlantic . These guys went off on some short cruise from New London to find this base . Just where were the Nazis operating ? Tyrone Power must have laughed himself silly every time he thought of this one . Especially in the South Pacific where served with the Marines in several major Pacific campaigns . At his funeral , there was a Marine honor guard as would befit a retired Major . The rest of the story is your standard triangle the kind Power played in with Don Ameche during peacetime in the 30s . Except that here , the Ameche part was played by Dana Andrews . One positive note . Black actor Ben Carter played a cook in the submarine galley and he's shown in an actual combat mission . It was an unusual role for a black actor to play at that time and I think he played it well . Some racial stereotyping , but his concern and affection for James Gleason who was the CPO on the submarine was real and rang true .
The Key To Her Heart	Although Alice Faye is in great voice and sings a very good number , Here's The Key To My Heart , in She Learned About Sailors the film itself is a rather dopey one about the romance of a caf√© singer and Navy enlisted man when they meet in Shanghai . Shanghai was a big port of call for our Navy in Kuomintang China , we had Marines stationed there for most of the years between the World Wars . The sailor in this film is Lew Ayres who even warbles a few unmemorable notes in passing . Sad to say though other than Alice's singing , She Learned About Sailors will not go down as one of her memorable films . Lew Ayres is unfortunately saddled with a pair of stumble-bum comics , Frank Mitchell and Jack Durant , who are constantly interfering one way or the other with their buddy's romance . The film is really all about them and their interference . Alice did manage to record Here's the Key to My Heart before Darryl F . Zanuck lowered the boom on her recording career . The record she does with it is a good one and it has the added attraction of Alice being backed by Rudy Vallee and the Connecticut Yankees with Rudy making an unbilled appearance on the record . But take it from me folks , the record Alice made is far better than the film the song came from .
" China , as big a picture as the nation that inspired it . "	Paramount got caught short in 1943 , their big discovery Alan Ladd was about to be drafted for who knew how long . So they had to get as much work out of him as they could before Uncle Sam claimed his services . That's the only reason that Alan Ladd at the threshold of his stardom was rushed into this film . That promotion line that I quoted in the title was as big a piece of hyperbole as ever came out of a publicity man's mind . China is clearly a B picture that was probably ready to roll with lesser known leads . Alan Ladd , Loretta Young , and William Bendix with a cast of Oriental players who never before or since in film history got as much work as during World War II , were rushed into this typical flagwaver . Ladd and Bendix are a couple of Americans who sell gasoline to whomever pays and in the Orient before Pearl Harbor , the Japanese yen was the strongest currency going . The Sino-Japanese war forces a sudden change in location of operations for them . Fleeing the city they were in , they come across Loretta Young , missionary teacher with a group of young girls in her charge . From this point on anyone who's watched any World War II era war pictures can figure the rest of the story from here . Loretta is as luminescent as ever , but she and Ladd have no chemistry at all . Ladd knows what Paramount is doing here and looks bored . Except in his scenes with sidekick Bendix . The two of them were close friends in real life . Bill Bendix was never bad in anything he did . By the way the movie poster that Paramount put out advertising China has a picture of Alan Ladd , bare-chested , machinegun in hand and sporting muscles that the Governator of Cal-lee-fornia would envy . In Alan Ladd's golden era at Paramount , they had some set of brass ones to put him in this nickelplated clinker .
Crisis In Midair	To start off with the title for Jet Over The Atlantic is completely a wrong one . The airliner that our passengers are taking from Madrid to New York is one of those old propeller type jobs . That's a harbinger for things to come with this film . A pity because if the producer , Benedict Bogeaus hadn't been so sloppy , he could have had a classic film on his hands . George MacReady at his sinister best in this film is an English lord who is upset with his wife Anna Lee and decides to kill her . He puts a bomb in his luggage as the two of them are embarking on a transatlantic flight . Not an exploding bomb mind you , but a device that's an incendiary that sets the baggage section on fire and causes a noxious poison to seep through the plane's ventilation systems . Some on the plane seem to be more susceptible than others for no discernible reason . Traveling on the plane is Guy Madison being extradited from Spain by FBI man George Raft . Guy's girlfriend Virginia Mayo is also on board as are a host of other passengers from all walks of life . Guy's a former pilot from the Korean War who was convicted wrongly of two murders and we see in the flashback he didn't do it . He's facing the death penalty with his return . But in an emergency , he's the only one on the plane who can help . I don't think I have to tell you how this ends , but this was a sloppy B film with a lot of holes in the story and in the execution . It's a poor man's The High And The Mighty and it's harbinger of those Airport films to come . The cast performs well enough and there certainly is a lot of tension in the air . Jet Over The Atlantic could have stood a lot of improvement though , starting with the title .
Far Fetched Set Of Circumstances	Perry Mason : The Case of the Avenging Ace is one of the more far fetched episodes where the murderer and the individual behind the murders will do anything , kill anybody to keep a particular family scandal from seeing the light of day . If you remember in Perry Mason Returns , Raymond Burr was an appellate judge who resigned the bench to defend Della Street from a murder charge . This film begins with a flashback to those times on the bench where he votes to sustain a conviction for murder on procedural grounds of Larry Wilcox , a decorated Air Force colonel who allegedly murdered a woman he was allegedly involved with . Fast forward to the present when a witness has come forward who on the day of the hearing reneges on his testimony under threat . Then Wilcox is busted out of jail and later the recanting witness is shot to death and Wilcox is found with murder weapon in hand . This far fetched set of circumstances would defeat any lesser lawyer , but we're dealing with Perry Mason . You know this top gun will eventually be free of all charges , including the original murder that sent him up . This particular Mason film I found a bit too bizarre for my taste , but fans of the series will love it .
It's A Jungle Out There	Just as Hollywood was getting far more realistic in its depiction of Africa starting with The African Queen and King Solomon's Mines , television took up the slack with all the clich√©s that had been done in Africa based films . Ramar of the Jungle was filmed as a syndicated series in the last days of European colonialism . It starred Jon Hall as Dr . Tom Reynolds who was born to missionary parents there and now was giving back to the community so to speak . His science sidekick was Ray Montgomery as Howard Ogden who was simply identified as a chemist . These two were in every episode . Hall and Montgomery had several other regulars , a different guide every season . James Fairfax was in for one season as Charley Smart who hailed from Capetown . The show moved to India for a season and latino actor Victor Millan played Zahir who was a Hindu . Then they were back in Africa and it was Nick Stewart as Willy Willy self proclaimed best guide in all Africa . In addition in the first season Ludwig Stossel and M'liss McClure played the Van Dynes father and daughter who owned a trading post . Ramar might have had a little something something going with Ms . Van Dyne , but she was dropped so Ramar concentrated strictly on science and medicine for the rest of the run . For a scientist Hall certainly got into a whole lot of trouble every episode and most of the time it wasn't necessarily coming out of his research and / or medical practice . Like another reviewer I too had a Ramar of the Jungle board game as a lad and I remember it seemed Ramar was in syndication on Channel 11 in New York forever . I'm sure if I saw the episodes today I'd probably laugh and be mortified at the appalling ignorance of the show's creators . It certainly couldn't be marketed today given it's white man's burden outlook . Still I do have a bit of nostalgia for Hall and Montgomery and all the trouble they managed to get into .
The Riddle Of The Dancing Men	Accurate bomb sighting was a McGuffin for many a World War II story . Air power was a new thing and you certainly wanted to be able to hit what you were aiming at and do the most damage at the same time when you were dropping explosive devices from thousands of feet in the air . Many a film plot was about bomb sights . In Sherlock Holmes And The Secret Weapon , Victorian Holmes is called up from the past to World War II to protect his blessed isle . Naturally of course we expect that his most ruthless rival , Professor Moriarty would be working for the bad guys which of course are the baddest guys ever , the Nazis . Holmes smuggles scientist William Post , Jr . out of Switzerland and his bomb sight plan , but things are hardly over for Basil Rathbone . Post is kidnapped by Lionel Atwill as Moriarty , but he's given the plans to four other scientists and stands up to Moriarty's torture . Still the man needs rescuing . The film is based on an Arthur Conan Doyle short story The Dancing Men and what that is all about is a kind of cipher that both Holmes and Moriarty work out almost simultaneously . It's the best part of the story as well it should be because it's the part that comes from the creator of Sherlock Holmes . Holmes , brought over to the middle of the 20th century for propaganda purposes , belongs back in Victorian England . The weakest of the Sherlock Holmes now that some sixty years has passed are those that were done in this manner . I will say this for Sherlock Holmes And The Secret Weapon , at least Doctor Watson isn't the boob that Nigel Bruce played him as in some of the films . Of course devoted fans of the Baker Street detective will be aghast at the game afoot here . But Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon is passably good entertainment .
The Rabbit Man And The Star	Part of the premise of The Lady Is Willing is that the famous can get away with anything . Picture if you will yourself who while the police are investigating reports of a baby abandoned in a boardinghouse , just up and taking the infant . That would probably land you in jail for a stretch . But for Marlene Dietrich , famous musical comedy star , everyone is just forgiving as all heck and let's her keep the little tyke . Everyone except the IRS who is insistence that she be solvent . Unmarried or not doesn't seem to be the issue . She owes a lot in income tax . So she persuades pediatrician Fred MacMurray to marry her . That would certainly save on doctor bills . As for Fred who wouldn't want to marry Marlene ? But when they enlarge their living quarters it's for cages for rabbits . MacMurray is doing research and needs them for experiments . He's also got an ex-wife sniffing around in the person of Arline Judge . She's more trouble than the rabbits . The Lady Is Willing just will never be ranked as one of the 10 best for either Fred or Marlene . It makes so little use of MacMurray's comic talents which I find very strange . As for Marlene , there are times in the film when she comes across more like Doris Day . Best in the film might possibly Marlene's girl Friday Aline McMahon . She has the film's best lines . But fans of Fred and Marlene should like it well enough .
The Lady In Red - - - - - - - - What a Personality ?	Pat O'Brien , part time critic and full time boozer , gets pulled away to Caliente in Mexico by his friend Edward Everett Horton to avoid getting married to gold digger Glenda Farrell . But it's out of the frying pan into the fire . Dolores Del Rio has a Spanish dancing act that O'Brien savagely panned one night after attending her performance stewed to the gills . That hurt her career and when she sees him on her home turf , she's going to get a little vengeance . She and father / manager Leo Carrillo . Of course if you can't figure out where this plot is going by now , you haven't seen too many old films . But the plot is just an excuse to string together four Busby Berkeley numbers , including the big hit that came out of the film , The Lady in Red . Dolores Del Rio , what a beauty she was . Hard to believe anyone could have panned her dancing . She sang beautifully as well . When she got her first big break in American cinema in the silent version of Ramona , she recorded the title song and even though the screen was silent , her record sold quite a bit , such was the allure she conveyed . Of course Pat O'Brien was his usual fast talking promoter , though slowed down a bit due to hangover . He didn't contribute anything musical here , but he's always a pleasure to watch . Phil Regan did some vocalizing including the elaborate Muchacha finale number . The DeMarcos danced , Wini Shaw sang , and Judy Canova in her screen debut reprised a hillbilly version of The Lady In Red to a flustered Edward Everett Horton . It was quite a funny moment . In Caliente is not the best of the Busby Berkeley Warner Brothers musicals , but it's still good entertainment .
Tense Gentlemen on the High Tension Wires	Edward G . Robinson and George Raft are a couple of linemen . Robinson is the foreman of the crew and a bit of a lug when it comes to the opposite sex . Raft however is a smooth operator . They both meet Marlene Dietrich at a clip joint , the Code euphemism for a bordello . Robinson falls for her and Dietrich's looking for a way out of the working life . They marry , but she starts getting a yen for Raft and that brings on trouble . Manpower has a place in film history having nothing to do with the content or the quality of the movie . While visiting his good buddy George Raft on the set , one Benjamin Siegel was introduced to Virginia Hill as depicted in the film Bugsy . There's a scene where Raft gets into a brawl with Barton MacLane that is depicted in Bugsy . And if that wasn't enough , Raft and Robinson got into a real brawl over Marlene just like in the film . It seems as though Dietrich was involved with Raft during the production . But Raft was not the most educated of men . Edward G . Robinson came from a slum background like Raft , but he'd educated himself and in fact was a well known art collector . Dietrich was no dummy herself and she and Eddie got friendly on the set , talking about stuff that Raft didn't have a clue about . Of course this got George jealous and they had a knock down drag out over her . You couldn't buy that kind of publicity . Lucky for Robinson Raft didn't call on Ben Siegel for his services . So Manpower entered its place in Hollywood lore . Too bad the film wasn't any great masterpiece . It's entertaining enough though with a good cast of Warner Brothers regulars supporting Ms . Dietrich and her gentlemen friends . It seems though just about every film Warners made back then had either Alan Hale or Frank McHugh in it , in this case both . They're always entertaining . Add to that Eve Arden in her usual role as the wisecracking best friend of the heroine . Not the greatest film ever made , but a historic one and not bad on the entertainment scale .
Canned And Banned	With a plot partially lifted from The Towering Inferno , Gold is a man made disaster of a film in every sense of the word . Ray Milland is the hard as nails South African gold mine magnate , Harry Hirschfeld . He's done something to get the gold traders mad at him because they're planning to do him dirt . John Gielgud is head a gold buying syndicate and he's planning with the connivance of Bradford Dillman who is Milland's grandson-in-law , to blow a hole in the Sonderditch mine that Milland owns , letting in the ocean and flooding the mine . The price of gold will go up because of the sudden shortage . The fact that a thousand men might be killed is of little importance to Gielgud and company . Nor is it to Dillman who's found out that his wife Susannah York has been cheating on him with Roger Moore the new mine general manager . The film is a sanctioned glimpse at the former Union of South Africa as the old apartheid government would like to show you . The mining sequences are quite well done and I wish that they had stuck to a simple disaster film instead throwing in the romance . In fact Roger Moore , intrepid hero that he is , looks ridiculous because when the ocean flood starts , he's out having a romp with Susannah York . Instead of applauding him for his eventual heroism , Milland should have had him canned and banned from the industry . Unless you like Roger Moore , I'd give iron pyrites a pass .
Widening the Screen , for the Battle of New Orleans	This was the last film that Cecil B . DeMille had anything to do with . He originally planned to direct this remake of his 1938 film The Buccaneer , but ill health prevented him from doing so . So apart from a brief prologue and a production credit saying the film was presented by him , DeMille left the producing to good friend Henry Wilcoxon and the directing to his son-in-law Anthony Quinn . This version has the added attractions of great technicolor photography and Paramount's new wide screen Vistavision process . I saw in the theater when I was 11 years old and it is quite an eyeful . Yul Brynner makes as dashing a Jean Lafitte as Fredric March did in the 1938 film . Charlton Heston repeats his Andrew Jackson role from The President's Lady which he made earlier in the Fifties . Heston though was not satisfied because he realized that he was made up to look like the Andrew Jackson we know from the double sawbuck when he was in the White House . At New Orleans he was a bit younger . But like Moses and the circus boss from The Greatest Show on Earth , you follow him to Hades and back . The best role in the film for me though was Charles Boyer as Dominic You , Lafitte's cynical second in command . A former artillery officer in Napoleon's army , he left there and took up piracy out of disillusionment with how the French Revolution turned out . Boyer has some good and wise lines in his counsel to Lafitte even if he's drunk while delivering some of them . After The Ten Commandments , DeMille had plans to make a film about Sir Robert Baden-Powell , the founder of the Boy Scouts and was in negotiations with David Niven to play Baden-Powell . He got sidetracked with this film and then he died in early 1959 . Of course the Boy Scout film never did get made by anyone . Although DeMille eliminated one element of the plot from 1938 the traitorous Senator played by Ian Keith the rest of the film is pretty much the same . This is hardly the real story of Jean Lafitte . When not on the action , the film does drag in spots . Maybe that's why Anthony Quinn never directed another film . This version of The Buccaneer had one additional thing going for it . Country singer Johnny Horton had a mega hit record of The Battle of New Orleans at the same time the film came out . Both must have fed off each other in profit making . I well remember you couldn't go a day without hearing The Battle of New Orleans playing some time on the radio . It's not history , it's DeMille at his gaudiest .
Gypsy Rose Lee in the frozen north .	Randolph Scott tones it down a might , but he continues in the role he had in The Spoilers as a con man in Alaska . He's running a gambling establishment in Malamute and has taken great pains to establish his identity as HONEST John Calhoun . Up pops Gypsy Rose Lee an old girl friend who heads a group of chorus girls who support her act . She's rightly suspicious and Randy has a con working with the help of Bob Burns , Charles Winninger and especially Victor Killian . I'm not going to say more , except it's a beaut . The main problem with the film is Gypsy Rose Lee can't act . But with those two prominent weapons of mass destruction she's sporting , who cares . William Marshall who's the second lead also can't act worth anything and he doesn't have what Gypsy has for a distraction . Jimmy Van Heusen and Johnny Burke wrote two of their biggest songs from the 40s for this film and interestingly enough NOT introduced by Bing Crosby although he did record them . The introducer is Dinah Shore who plays Winninger's daughter in the film and she sings Sleigh Ride In July and Like Someone In Love and does them well . What she saw in William Marshall I can't figure out . If you like Randolph Scott and Gypsy Rose Lee's assets that's a good enough reason to watch this .
Range War Western	Big rancher Alexander Knox has married Joan Leslie former girlfriend of smaller rancher Randolph Scott . Knox is a brooding jealous sort of man and wants Scott out the territory . He hires some gunslingers headed by Richard Rober to do the job . Scott's a ' peaceable man ' in the tradition of Wild Bill Elliott , but don't provoke him too much . But Knox is determined to start a range war out of jealousy . It becomes an open war after Rober kills brothers Camerone Mitchell and Richard Crane who work for Scott . And the wild part is that Scott's now taken a fancy to Ellen Drew . A previous reviewer said that Alexander Knox was miscast in a western . True he isn't a typical western actor , but a whole lot of people went west to make names for themselves of all kinds . Knox does a good job of the brooding and jealous rancher with a deep seated inferiority complex . Now it's also true that Richard Rober is a little too nattily dressed for a villain , but that sure is a western stereotype . I think he made a very good villain in this western . Rober was tragically killed in an automobile accident soon after this picture was finished . A good career in villainy was cut short . A lot of plot similarities to this and The Violent Men also done by Columbia Pictures a few years later . It's a good entry from the Randolph Scott western collection .
Ain't a Patch on the John Ford version	After seeing this version on AMC a few days ago , I took out my copy of the original from 1939 . It's the difference between a classic western and a routine action film . Director Gordon Douglas probably because there is an unwritten rule in Hollywood that no one is ever to shoot a film in Monument Valley but John Ford , shot this thing in Colorado . It's not badly photographed , but you really miss the sweeping vistas of the Arizona desert . The Apache become the Sioux here and instead we have Geronimo jumping the reservation it's Crazy Horse instead . One of the great moments of cinema westerns in the original Stagecoach is when the cavalry sweeps by the passing Stagecoach to engage the Apaches in the rescue . John Ford liked it so much he used the same gambit in Fort Apache . In this version you have to believe that the passengers fought them off themselves and then made it into Cheyenne on three wheels with less horses . No way , Jose . Poor Alex Cord , a competent actor , is no John Wayne . Of course who is and Cord tries his best , but you can't forget the Duke . Michael Connors as Hatfield lacks fire in his portrayal . John Carradine created a real air of mystery about the gambler . Nothing like that here . This is one of Bing Crosby's few non-singing roles and he got some deservedly good reviews for reprising Thomas Mitchell's Doc Boone . In fact some of his scenes with Red Buttons as Peacock the whiskey drummer are faintly reminiscent of Crosby's work with Bob Hope . Buttons is not Donald Meek and he plays the part differently . Meek was a man with a Dickensian name and he played mostly parts that fit that name perfectly . After the Indian attack , Buttons is a man with a few drinks under his belt ready to lick the world . It's different , but nicely done . Another musical performer in this was Ann-Margret . For the life of me I can't figure out why with two people like Crosby and Ann-Margret , they didn't give her and him a song or two , a duet maybe . Especially since in the plot line here , Crosby takes a fatherly interest in Ann-Margret as well as in Alex Cord . Her role of Dallas is as a saloon girl so a musical number would not have been out of place . The rest of the cast performs adequately . Bob Cummings's Gatewood is more fully developed a character here and a bigger rat . Van Heflin and Slim Pickens are able substitutes for George Bancroft and Andy Devine . Stefanie Powers as the pregnant cavalry officer's wife is adequate . The part itself is as thin as the original version with Louise Platt doing it . The gunfight between the Plummers and Ringo is more fully developed here . You actually don't see it in the 1939 version . Keenan Wynn as Luke Plummer is also more fully developed than was Tom Tyler . Tyler with a minimum of dialog suggested the menace of Luke Plummer . But Keenan Wynn is one evil man here . In fact whole pages of dialog are taken from the original . Interesting that 20 years later another version was done . But this Stagecoach is a perfect example of why classics should just be left alone .
Get That Trophy Wife	The team that brought you Marty , writer Paddy Chayefsky and director Delbert Mann brought Middle Of The Night to the big screen . It was first an original drama for television with E . G . Marshall and Eva Marie Saint for the Philco Playhouse . It then went to Broadway where it ran 477 performances in 1956-57 and starred Edward G . Robinson and Gena Rowlands with Joshua Logan directing . Delbert Mann who did direct the original television play returns for the screen version and Paddy Chayefsky considerably expanded his play to accommodate for the screen . That was probably a most wise move by the producers . The story is a March / September romance between Kim Novak , a young divorc√©e and widower Fredric March who seems to have settled down to a dull existence with work and his children's problems . Kim's a troubled girl herself , having been hurt a few times by men her own age maybe looking for a bit of stability which she sees in March . March met certain criticism that he was not ethnic enough to play a middle aged Jewish businessman in the garment trade . But March overcomes the objections with talent honed over 40 years at that point . In fact he'd played an Italian father in one of the stories in It's A Big Country and done that well . There's a really nice performance from Albert Dekker as a salesman in March's firm who makes no secret of his flagrant abuses of his marriage vows when on the road trying to sell . The character is more than borrowed from Arthur Miller's Willy Loman in Death Of A Salesman which March starred in on the screen . It's a good film with a bad message , in fact I'm not sure what Chayefsky is trying to say . Basically it seems that he's saying get that trophy wife you rich old dudes and bear the problems that come with it . Novak causes March a good deal of headaches and if he marries her it's with the full realization a lot of heartaches are going to come with it . She's a lusty young girl with needs more than security and he's getting on in years . Need I say more . Better March start dealing with a reputable escort agency .
This Could Be the Start of a Beautiful Friendship	In between making That Hamilton Woman and Henry V both of which could be argued were better contributions to the propaganda front of the British war effort , Laurence Olivier made this film about a Soviet engineer who designs a new type ship propeller and the government contracts with a British firm to build and install it on a ship . This is taking place in 1939 before any general war breaks out in Europe . Two things I found interesting about The Demi-Paradise . Firstly the fact that the proper name of the country , the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics , or USSR , or the Soviet Union is never used once in the film . Olivier always refers to his country as Russia , as do the others in the cast . Secondly , you never hear one word about the German-Soviet non - aggression pact . I suppose that might have been better than the clumsy explanations given in the American film Mission to Moscow . But whether Czarist or Marxist it's a different world that Olivier steps into when he arrives in the United Kingdom . He's pretty suspicious at first , but his interaction with British people in all walks of life gradually wins him over . Not the least of which is pretty Penelope Ward who's conducting a campaign of her own as far as Olivier is concerned . Hardly the greatest film Olivier ever did . Then again he nor anyone else managed to get themselves blacklisted over it , did they ?
The Reader's Digest Version Of Fifty Million Frenchmen	I would not say that Bob Hope was a major star on Broadway , that eluded him until he got into films , but he was a prominent Broadway performer during the Thirties before he went to Hollywood for The Big Broadcast of 1938 . This short was made in New York probably between his run in Roberta and Say When . What Paree , Paree is is a condensed version of the Cole Porter Broadway show Fifty Million Frenchmen . The soundtrack includes You Do Something To Me , Find me a Primitive Man , You've Got That Thing , and the title song all from the stage production of Fifty Million Frenchmen . This short while it lacks a lot of production values is a marvelous opportunity to see something of a photographed Broadway show of the time . In that it's like The Marx Brothers Cocoanuts or Animal Crackers . Bob Hope was not in the original Broadway cast of Fifty Million Frenchmen , but Cole Porter would provide him with a great duet with Ethel Merman in Hope's last Broadway appearance a few years later in Red , Hot , and Blue . He introduced It's Delovely with her from that show which did lead to his Hollywood contract . Now that would be great if someone preserved them on film singing It's Delovely .
WWWWild Bill WWait For Me ! ! !	That Andy Devine always yelling at Wild Bill Hickok to slow down and allow his to catch up . Hickok's appaloosa Buckshot had a lot less weight to carry than Andy's trusty pinto steed Joker , given the handicap allowance , Andy was right to complain . This television series had nothing to do with the story of the real James Butler Hickok , nicknamed Wild Bill by his contemporaries . You'd hardly know from this show that Hickok would meet an abrupt demise in Deadwood . Or that his famous tenure as Marshal of Abilene lasted slightly over a year . Guy Madison was a fine Wild Bill , a cowboy hero in the tradition of movie cowboy heroes and Andy who had been doing sidekick roles for Roy Rogers in his feature films just prior to signing on for this television series was the comic relief as Wild Bill's deputy Jingles Jones . We all know how good a marshal Andy would have been , we have only The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance for reference . I can still hear Andy yelling impatiently at Wild Bill to slow down at the end of every episode . It was a tag line like the one where some knowledgeable citizen identified that masked man as the Lone Ranger . Still I wouldn't mind if TVLand channel would acquire this series and run some of these . I don't care if they're black and white , no one else should either .
Inconvenient Allies	City Heat casts two of Hollywood's biggest box office draws of the past forty years in the same film as different types . The film is set in Kansas City of 1933 which richly earned the reputation it had back in the day of a wide open town . This was in fact the Kansas City of Tom Pendergast . Clint Eastwood is a by the book and honest city detective , not an easy thing to be in Kansas City of that era . Burt Reynolds is a former cop who's now a roguish private eye . The two of them have a history , they like each other well enough , but they also grate on each other's nerves . As all good private eyes have , Burt has a cool and efficient Effie like secretary in Jane Alexander and a partner in Richard Roundtree . Burt's one of the few back in the day who would even consider going into business with a black person . But Roundtree's playing a lone hand involving a runaway bookkeeper and a war between two rival mobs headed by Rip Torn and Tony LoBianco . For his troubles Roundtree winds up dead and in the same tradition of Sam Spade , when your partner's killed you do something about it . But it's also Eastwood's homicide case and like it or not the two are forced into an alliance of inconvenience , kicking and screaming right up to the end of the picture . The plot also calls for rescuing Alexander who Eastwood fancies , Madeline Kahn who's Burt's girlfriend and chanteuse Irene Cara . City Heat is not at the top of the list of films by Eastwood and Reynolds . But they've got nothing to be ashamed of her . The film glides effortlessly from comedy to drama and both guys get their innings to show why they're the superstars they are . You could do a lot worse than City Heat for your viewing pleasure .
Both Sides of the Moral and Immoral	Hardcore is the mirror image of Boogie Nights . Whereas Boogie Nights the pornography industry is seen from the participant's point of view , Hardcore shows it from the outside . It's not a pretty picture . Though the film itself doesn't come off in many ways , no question that George C . Scott's performance in the lead is strong dynamic stuff . He's a Midwest businessman of conservative values from Grand Rapids , Michigan whose daughter runs off during a church youth convention out in Southern California . It would have been very easy to have made Scott's character something of ridicule . This was right around the time of the founding of the Moral Majority and Scott's church seems just the kind to have signed up for that . Instead Scott creates a sympathetic and totally believable character as the father who dominates the film . In order to accomplish his mission he has to invade a world he hasn't a clue about , but he proves surprisingly resourceful . Also look for a good performance by Peter Boyle as a private detective who operates on both sides of the moral and immoral . Hardcore is not a great film , but it's a great performance by George C . Scott .
Familiar Ground	I have to imagine that in order for MGM to justify using two of their top leading men with Joan Crawford , their parts in Forsaking All Others would have to have been built up considerably . The original Broadway production of this comedy that ran 110 performances in 1933 starred Tallulah Bankhead and it was strictly her show . As if it would have been any other way . I have to give Joan Crawford credit on this one . Unlike her later film Susan and God where she tries to imitate Gertrude Lawrence with accent and all , she wisely does not try to do a Tallulah impersonation . She creates her own character here and it's a good one . She's got both Robert Montgomery and Clark Gable after her , but she chooses early on and in the end she finds out she chooses wrong . In fact the only impersonation Crawford does is one of her Grand Hotel co-star Greta Garbo . Both Clark Gable and Robert Montgomery settle into familiar stereotypes for them . Gable is another reporter character like he is It Happened One Night and Montgomery is an irresponsible playboy like he was in a gazillion films . Montgomery and Crawford are set to be married , but Montgomery leaves her at the altar and runs off with his demanding mistress Frances Drake . But Crawford has Gable's shoulder to cry on for most of the rest of the film . By the way , Drake gives a performance that's a case study in canine feminus . She makes Joan Collins in Dynasty look like Maria Von Trapp . Drake dominates in whatever scene she's in . No way that Tallulah Bankhead would have let that happen on stage . Charles Butterworth and Billie Burke are also on hand and young Rosalind Russell on her way up has a small part as one of Crawford's friends . Nothing new in Forsaking All Others , but the ground is familiar enough .
The New Praetor ' s Intentions	Star Trek : Nemesis is to date the last of the Star Trek films based on one of the Gene Roddenberry series . It's open to speculation whether we'll see another one . It would be disappointing indeed if more did not come out to satisfy the legion of fans out there . Nemesis finds Captain Jean Luc Picard and his crew sent by Admiral Janeway who made it back from that odyssey in the Delta Quadrant to a promotion . Kate Mulgrew has a mission for Patrick Stewart and the Enterprise , it's a diplomatic one . His assignment is to go to Romulus itself and assess the new leadership there . A race that's been enslaved by the Romulans has overthrown the empire and there's a new Praetor running things . And what a surprise the Enterprise and its crew gets when they do get to Romulus . The new Praetor is human and bred from the DNA of Patrick Stewart which the Romulans acquired way back when and is played by Tom Hardy . Without any asking , Hardy provides a few drops of blood for the Star Trek crew and Dr . Gates McFadden gives us the answer about the ancestry . Hardy's got quite a scheme to set himself as conqueror of the Universe in fact . It's up to the Enterprise to stop him , not easy with a new weapon and an enhanced Romulan cloaking device . Stewart's not the only member of the Enterprise crew to come up against a relative of sorts . Data finds an early model of himself on a desolated planet and pieces him together . That sets up an interesting subplot for Nemesis . When Star Trek : The Next Generation completed its television run , I fully expected that Wesley Crusher's character would return in one of the films . Especially the way he was written out of the series , it set up all kinds of intriguing plot possibilities . Hopefully Paramount will keep that in mind and get a grown up Wil Wheaton to repeat his role of the future's model kid . I didn't quite understand what hardy had against the human races , especially when it was the Romulans who created and then enslaved him . It's a fatal plot hole and prevents this film from being a real science fiction classic . Still for fans of Star Trek it should satisfy them .
An Old Gunfighter With A Few New Tricks	Borrowing heavily from True Grit and Rooster Cogburn and the Over the Hill gang movies , Robert Preston is old time gunfighter Ben Sunday hired out by a nun to escort some Indian orphans to a town with a soon to be infamous name of Columbine . Sister Patty Duke Astin is going to take over an old church and start a school there . Bad enough she's defying her own church priest Father Jacques Aubuchon in undertaking the journey . He'd just as soon see the army take care of these children of the recently hostile . But the good sister finds when she gets to Columbine , the abandoned church has been taken over by another gunfighter Christopher Lloyd who now runs a saloon there . That ain't sacramental wine he's serving either . Of course true to the cowboy code of Hollywood , Preston just can't let this situation stand . September Gun is pretty dependent on the considerable charms of Robert Preston and they are considerable . Preston has some nice chemistry with young actor David Knell who is his nephew and who he's teaching the gunfighting business with the emphasis on staying alive by whatever means available . If this had been a bigger budgeted film , I could see Clint Eastwood or a few years before , John Wayne , playing this part in a theatrically released film . Still September Gun will entertain and satisfy fans of the western genre .
Teresa Says , " Just Gary and Me , and Baby Makes Three . "	Gary Cooper in the first half of the Forties made four films for director Sam Wood . Three of them were big budget items , Pride of the Yankees , For Whom The Bells Toll , and Saratoga Trunk . The fourth is a pleasant and innocuous little comedy called Casanova Brown . The film was adapted by Floyd Dell who wrote the novel and play it was based on called Accidental Father . It had previously been filmed twice by Warner Brothers and once by the French cinema . It ran on Broadway in the 1929 season and probably got closed with the stock market crash . All the names were changed in this adaption , but the plot line remained essentially the same . Gary Cooper is about to get married to Anita Louise when he gets a cryptic note from Teresa Wright . He confides in Anita's father , Frank Morgan who is a fellow colleague at the college where Cooper is an English professor . Morgan also seems to function more as a western sidekick for Cooper than a father of the bride for Louise . Cooper's little secret is that he was ever so briefly married to Teresa Wright . Her cryptic note says he should go to a maternity hospital in Chicago and see a certain doctor there . Cooper of course arrives at some logical conclusions . Teresa of course has an agenda of her own and I can't say too much more as both women fight for Cooper . Of course with that baby , Ms . Wright definitely has the upper hand . Casanova Brown was the second of two films Cooper and Wright did together , the first being the highly acclaimed Pride of the Yankees . This film isn't anything like the epic story of Lou Gehrig , but it is definitely a pleasant enough diversion . It's an opportunity to see Frank Morgan in a rare appearance outside the MGM studio . He has some very good moments in Casanova Brown as Cooper's confidante . However Casanova Brown has one claim to immortality . There is a flashback sequence where Cooper is telling Morgan about the relationship with Wright . After they've eloped Wright brings Cooper to meet her parents who are played by Edmond Breon and Patricia Collinge . Collinge is a believer in astrology and no smoking . Cooper in an effort to hide the fact he smoked a cigarette in their house , manages to burn their house down . It is one of the most hilarious things ever put on film . The rest of the film is good and entertaining , but it doesn't match up to that scene . See Casanova Brown for that alone .
Stroked My Funny Bone	When Bewitched was running on television half of the plots involved Darrin's job where he and Larry Tate every week contended with yet another egotistical company president . The plot of Stroker Ace hearkens back to those days of Bewitched and it has Burt Reynolds as a NASCAR driver doing everything possible to get out from under a contract with a sponsor who's a blithering idiot . Although Burt certainly gets in his innings in Stroker Ace , especially seeing him in a chicken suit and driving his car in a race in one , the best one in Stroker Ace by far is Ned Beatty . Beatty got an Academy Award nomination for playing the all powerful , malevolent media mogul in Network . Here he takes the same character and plays it for laughs and he's absolutely hysterical . Beatty owns a fried chicken company and he could easily have been one of McMahon & Tate's clients from Bewitched . If outrageous overacting lead by Ned Beatty isn't reason enough to watch Stroker Ace , than certainly the curvaceous Loni Anderson should do . Loni is giving out with her best Marilyn Monroe imitation as Beatty's advertising person who thinks that what Beatty is asking of Reynolds is tasteless and stupid . Of course she falls for Burt on the screen and in real life . I'm not a NASCAR fan , but I don't think you have to be to watch Stroker Ace and enjoy it . I have however become a fan of the Professional Bull Riders in recent years and they have their sponsors set up in a similar fashion as does NASCAR for its various drivers . I don't think the PBR has any sponsors as outrageous as Ned Beatty . If this film was about the PBR I can just see Beatty insisting to Guilherme Marchi that he ride a bull in a chicken suit or something equally bizarre . The film got bad reviews and I can't see why . It's not sophisticated comedy to be sure , but it's not all that bad . And Ned Beatty alone is worth seeing and appreciating Stroker Ace .
A Most Secret Society	The Star Chamber is a film that operates under the premise that the legal system has gone awry and it's up to the judges to apply corrective action to the decisions they officially make in court . Interestingly enough Hal Holbrook who came to that conclusion as Lieutenant Briggs in the Dirty Harry film Magnum Force , is now taking a similar position as a judge . Michael Douglas as a young Superior Court Judge in Los Angeles has reached the same crossroads . After a couple of decisions on procedure that resulted in criminals being cut loose , he starts to question whether the whole criminal justice system is out of whack . That's when Hal Holbrook tells him about a most secret society . A panel of nine judges have taken it upon themselves to overrule their own rulings . Douglas eagerly joins them , but certain things to go off course for him and he questions whether he's made the right career move . The cases that Douglas came a cropper on is stuff straight out of the Law and Order episode file . In that series sometimes I think the judge's rulings are somewhat bizarre . Of course in that series it just makes Jack McCoy and his successor try all the harder to win . It's a nice film , but I do get the feeling that Star Chamber is a Law and Order episode stretched out for a feature film .
Rounding Up The Burns Brothers	For those of you who think the American West was a rough place to be , ought to take a look at The Proposition and what it took to bring in the famous bushrangers of the day . In fact the methods used to kill Jesse James and Billy the Kid are nothing compared to what constabulary captain Ray Winstone tries to do get the infamous Burns brothers . The film opens with Winstone and his men capturing two out of the three , young Richard Wilson just leaving his teens and middle brother Guy Pearce . But the eldest , the leader , Danny Huston is the one they really want . At that point Winstone comes up with a proposition that I'm sure the authorities in the USA would never have put to Frank James in order to get Jesse . He sets Pearce free and says to him , bring Huston in or the younger one hangs in nine days . Let me make it clear here , that the Burns brothers aren't busy robbing banks or trains in some populist war of their own making like the James brothers . All three of the brothers and the rest of their gang were just busy massacring a settler family and raping the pregnant mother . These are not nice people , still this is not something most of us would have had the nerve to propose . A lot goes wrong from both sides and it all ends with a lot of blood spilled . If a semblance of law and order is established by the end of the film , you be the judge . The Australian frontier of the nineteenth century was not a place for the fainthearted . Still The Proposition suffers from a lack of rooting interest for either side , both are so bloody . The most sympathetic character is that of Emily Watson , Winstone's wife . I might have enjoyed The Proposition more if there was a decent rooting interest provided by the story . Still The Proposition is a well crafted picture of life on the Australian frontier , shot on that frontier in Queensland .
MGM shows off	This silent documentary short is a studio tour of the newly created MGM studios at the time . We get to see all the stars that were under contract at the time as well as a lot of behind the scenes people and the studio executives , topped off by Louis B . Mayer and Irving Thalberg . Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was just getting started at this time . It was an amalgamation of Metro studios and the former Goldwyn Picture Company . Sam Goldwyn was originally Sam Goldfish and he originally was with Famous-Players-Lasky which eventually became Paramount . Goldfish and Edgar Selwyn left Famous-Players-Lasky and formed Goldwyn Pictures taking the first syllable from Goldfish and the last from Selwyn as their company name . Goldfish liked the new name so much he took it for his own . Well , it could have wound up Selfish Pictures . Anyway Goldwyn soon left that to branch out on his own as an independent producer . Sam Goldwyn never had anything to do with what became MGM though his name is forever on their product . It was originally Metro-Goldwyn . Louis B . Mayer as president had enough ego and clout to then get his name tagged on at the end . And it became Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer . I believe this short was a kind of cinematic brochure for the new studio that was being launched . I got a very big kick out of a shot with the caption of MGM showing off its new discovery , Lucille LeSeuer who as we all know shortly became Joan Crawford . The short is a real treat though , hopefully TCM will broadcast it at some point . And just think about a studio named Metro-Selfish-Mayer .
Note The Billing	Please take careful notice of the billing in the title of this film . It's about a society woman , Susan Trexel , who has taken up religion as some kind of a new fad . Ms . Trexel is rather full of herself and she would no doubt approve of the Deity getting second billing in a play about her life . Susan and God , a play by Rachel Crothers , ran on Broadway for the 1937-1938 season for 256 performances and starred Gertrude Lawrence who got rave reviews for her performance as the Long Island society woman who is so full of herself that she neglects husband and daughter for her various fads . She's embraced a particular type of Christianity in which it's believed confession is not just good , but necessary for the soul . Not only your confession , but you must apparently be brutally frank about everyone around you . I knew a woman many years ago when I lived in New York . She was a union official , the treasurer of a local . This was an office she used the way Susan Trexel uses her new religion , to become the world's biggest busybody , interjecting herself into everyone's business . When you're a busybody by nature it's great if you can find a religion that says God requires you to be one . I wish I could give Susan and God a higher rating . But the fault lies with Joan Crawford who apparently made the mistake of seeing Gertrude Lawrence in the play . Someone who's never seen or heard Gertrude Lawrence might not catch it and just think Crawford is too mannered in her portrayal . But her inflections are unmistakable , her imitation of Lawrence just keeps coming out . She should have been a little more Joan Crawford in her performance . That's a pity too , because apparently Crawford got both Louis B . Mayer and George Cukor to get the film rights to Susan and God in the hope of broadening her range as an actress . I couldn't say she succeeded here . Fredric March plays her long suffering husband , a likable man driven to drink because of his wife and young Rita Quigley plays her shy daughter who Crawford has no time for . Rita Hayworth , a screen goddess to be , has a small role as a young actress who has married producer Nigel Bruce for her career . You can tell easily she was going to be a star . Fans of Joan Crawford might like seeing her trying something different , but sad that it wasn't more of her in the role .
Switching to Sound	Blackmail has the double distinction of being both Alfred Hitchcock's first sound film for British cinema . I think if they knew this would be the first the British would have had one of their great music hall stars do a musical as we did with Al Jolson and the Jazz Singer . That it turned out that Alfred Hitchcock directed it was pure coincidence because Alfred Hitchcock wasn't ALFRED HITCHCOCK then . Anny Ondra and John Longden have a silly lover's quarrel at a restaurant and Anny leaves in a huff with artist Cyril Ritchard . He's charming at first , but then when he gets physical she resists . And when Ritchard tries to rape her , Ondra stabs him . Longden is a police detective and wouldn't you know it , he's assigned to this case . This is where the plot gets a little silly because I'm sure Ondra could have beaten the rap with a competent defense lawyer , pleading self defense . But Longden chooses to hide evidence that would implicate her . Donald Calthrop as a sleazy guy with a long criminal record happens to see Ondra leave the crime scene and he puts two and two together . He tries blackmail , but our intrepid lovers tough it out . The film climaxes in a nicely done sequence through the British Museum ending on the roof . It's the first of many of these type scenes that typify a Hitchcock production . When Hitchcock after beginning this film as a silent , switched to sound he didn't anticipate that German actress Anny Ondra's accent would have been so thick that early sound made it not understandable . Like Jean Hagen's voice in Singing in the Rain dubbed by Debbie Reynolds , Ondra's voice was completely dubbed over by Joan Barry . Best performance in the film by far is that of Donald Calthrop as the blackmailer . He played many such slimy roles in early British cinema . Can't say this was a great film even with a couple of distinguished firsts attached to it . The plot is just a bit much , but Hitchcock certainly gave lots of evidence of what he would give the public over the years .
Oil Versus Fish	I do have to wonder whether in these days of terrorism and the fluctuating oil market , a film like Susanna Pass could be made today and just who the villain is . Roy Rogers is a fish and game warden for the state of California and he weighs in with his good offices in a fight between two brothers , Robert Emmett Keane and Lucien Littlefield , one bad and one good . Bad brother is newspaper editor Keane who's a rich guy looking to get richer . And that would be at the expense of good brother Lucien Littlefield who's got a piece of land on which he's created an artificial lake and uses it as a fish hatchery . He's assisted in this worthy endeavor by Dale Evans who is an ichthyologist . But there's oil under that lake , black gold , Texas tea as that old TV theme used to say . Keane is in cahoots with escaped convict Douglas Fowley to get that land by fair means or foul , mostly foul . Later on a different view of the oil situation and drilling underwater would be voiced in the Anthony Mann / James Stewart film , Thunder Bay . I'm willing to bet that former president Herbert Hoover who was a serious fresh water fisherman would have endorsed this film . I'll bet he saw it when out and loved it . Especially with that valedictory that Roy gives about the youth of America getting out in the fresh air and enjoying fishing as our forefathers did . Hoover was also a founder and spokesperson for the Boys Clubs of America as well . Hopefully that oil is still under that lake in Susanna Pass so we can get it out when needed in a pinch .
Mary Should Have Dialed It Down	For her sound film debut , Mary Pickford chose what she figured would have a built in box office appeal besides her own good name , a long running Broadway play . Coquette which was authored by George Abbott and Ann Preston Bridger and directed by Abbott for Jed Harris , ran 386 performances in the 1927-1928 season . Pickford took over a role popularized by a young Helen Hayes on Broadway . Mary Pickford knew that her days of playing adolescents or young teens were gone . Still there's a trace of the juvenile in her performance as a young and flirty southern belle who her father , John St . Polis , should not be out slumming with white trash like Johnny Mack Brown . Mary's family is of the southern country club set . Mary's got a younger brother played by William Janney and when dad thinks it's him that stayed out late , he's just got a boys will be boys attitude . But when Mary stays out with the forbidden Mr . Brown , that's the proverbial horse of a different color . After that film gets highly melodramatic . The fabled Douglas Fairbanks / Mary Pickford romance was starting to come apart with both of them cheating on the other . It probably helped that Mary was involved with Johnny Mack Brown at the time of the filming of Coquette . Gave her scenes quite a bit of conviction . Johnny Mack Brown who was an All American halfback with the University of Alabama's Crimson Tide before Paul Bryant ever took over , chose the silver screen over professional athletics . For this southern story his Alabama accent no doubt helped as it did later when he became a cowboy hero in a ton of B westerns . Mary does overact a lot here . Then again , all the silent stars who had no real stage training or directors to help them dial it down a bit did the same thing , her husband definitely one of those . Though it wouldn't get a look today , I'm sure Mary's performance in that transition year , probably was one of the best and she no doubt deserved her Best Actress Oscar . Coquette is a play I'm sure you won't see get revived to often . It never has on Broadway . It's dated and highly melodramatic , still for today's viewers it's a curiosity .
Making Money With Hell	Dante's Inferno was Spencer Tracy's final film for Fox before settling in at MGM where his career really took off . It was probably one of the biggest budget films Fox had ever done up to that time with two disasters and a dream sequence of hell . Tracy plays a ship stoker and would be con man who gets fired off his ship for malingering . Down on his luck , kindly old Henry B . Walthall who owns a sideshow attraction at a carnival midway takes him in and Walthall's daughter Claire Trevor falls for him . Spence is nothing if not determined to make something of himself and he becomes a rich man in the amusement game . But his ethics leave a lot to be desired . The title is not Dante Alighieri's famous poetic saga of his journey through hell , but it's the name of the exhibit that Walthall owns . It's ' educational ' but Tracy starts on his road to financial success by glamorizing the more prurient aspects of it . The Inferno catches fire and there's a climatic ship's fire as well that Cecil B . DeMille could not have staged better . One wishes the film had been in color for that as well as the imaginary ten minute journey through hell that Walthall describes to Tracy . The dancing team on the ship before the fire marks the screen debut of one Marguerite Carmen Cansino or better known as Rita Hayworth . She was quite the dancer on screen as well as in this person's opinion , the biggest sex symbol the screen ever knew . Dante's Inferno was a fine film for Tracy to leave Fox with . But it would have astonished the executives at Fox if they could have imagined the career direction it would take at MGM .
His Final Service To His Profession And His Client	Spencer Tracy's only venture into the noir genre finds him playing James P . Curtayne , an alcoholic criminal lawyer who is living with daughter Diana Lynn . She's essentially put her life on hold to take care of her father . Friends from his old neighborhood ask him to defend their son , James Arness , who is being charged with a homicide during the course of a what we would now call a home invasion . Tracy's not up to it , he's past his prime and unable to break down the perjured testimony of William Campbell who says Arness was the trigger man in the crime . He's got a sharp District Attorney in John Hodiak going against him . And he's got a client who's lying about his real whereabouts to shield someone else . When the verdict of guilty is read against Arness in The People Against O'Hara it should be over . But not quite . I liked John Hodiak as the District Attorney . He's good in anything he does and his role here is as an honest lawyer who's more interested in finding out the truth than scoring another prosecutorial notch on his belt . That in itself is very refreshing . Given Spencer Tracy's own alcholism this must have been a part way too close to home for him . But he also is determined to serve his client to the best of his abilities which are sharply impaired when he makes a bad error in judgment in bribing witness Jay C . Flippen . Usually Flippen plays upright characters so this portrayal of a witness willing to sell his testimony to the highest bidder is against type and good . Other good performances of note are Eduardo Ciannelli as the mob boss of the Fulton Fish Market , Pat O'Brien as Tracy's long time friend and homicide cop , and in a bit role in the end Ann Doran as a policewoman who puts herself on the line in the final confrontation scene . Both Tracy and Hodiak in this film are two of the best portrayals of the legal profession on the screen . Even Tracy's ethical lapses are done with the best of intentions . The People Against O'Hara is a great example of film noir at it's best and one of the screen's finest players in his only venture in noir .
Orson's finest hour	Both the novel by Meyer Levin and the movie came out at the time that Nathan Leopold was granted parole after serving over 30 years of a life sentence for killing Bobby Franks . The film itself is a B picture with an out of place , fiftyish jazz score that is distracting . Other than some antique vehicles and kids dancing the Charleston , the film does little to capture the atmosphere of the 1920s when the Loeb-Leopold case took place . The acting by the cast is competent . What lifts Compulsion from the ranks of the ordinary is Orson Welles . Compulsion is arguably the finest work he ever did outside the films he directed himself , maybe The Third Man is the only competition . Welles's speech to the jury is absolutely mesmerizing , how he didn't get into the Oscar sweepstakes is a mystery for the ages . Welles's Jonathan Wilks captures the real Clarence Darrow far more than Spencer Tracy as Henry Drummond in Inherit the Wind . For you Orson Welles fans this is a must .
Taking Over Someone Else's Caper	Now personally I don't see what Anthony Quinn was squawking about in Larceny , Inc . Edward G . Robinson and sidekicks Edward Brophy and Broderick Crawford take over a caper that Quinn has planned . Robinson serves his time in prison and Quinn gets denied parole . It's not like Quinn took a copyright out on the idea and you can't count on him busting out of stir . Nevertheless that's what Quinn does and he does see things differently which is the whole basis for the plot of Larceny , Inc . Edward G . Robinson , as he did in a number of films , gets a chance to satirize his own gangster image and he does it quite well . This was one of his last films under his Warner Brothers contract and he went out in style . Robinson would be back at Warner Brothers in the latter half of the Forties with Key Largo which was definitely not a comedy . Robinson is the brains and he gets stalwart support from Edward Brophy and Broderick Crawford , two guys who at that time usually played simple minded lovable lugs . Brophy went with the flow , but Crawford was quoted as saying that he was not the world's greatest wit , but he always resented playing half a one . He got his big chance at the end of the Forties with All the King's Men and an Oscar . Robinson's adopted daughter is Jane Wyman and her beau is salesman Jack Carson . Wyman was also a few years from an Oscar for Johnny Belinda and Carson did break the mold of playing lovable blowhards . It's a pretty funny film , best scene is when Crawford strikes a pipeline in the basement and for a minute they think they've struck oil in New York City . And already refined too .
The Right To Think , Still On Trial	My thoughts on this remake of Inherit The Wind and the slant that it was given arise from one thing only , the possibility in early 1988 that Pat Robertson would be a presidential candidate . The main difference between the classic 1960 version and this television one is that Matthew Harrison Brady is considering yet a fourth run for the presidency . To bring the country back to God , or at least his version of God . Listening to Kirk Douglas as Brady and remembering the times that this television film was made , the context is essential to understand what was going on . In real life of course William Jennings Bryan was thoroughly cured of the presidential bug by 1925 . He was still very much an influence in the party , especially in rural areas such as Eastern Tennessee where the Scopes Trial took place . In real life Bryan would have been 68 in 1928 had he lived and I'm willing to bet he'd have fought mightily against the nomination of the Roman Catholic Alfred E . Smith . In this version a lot of business is eliminated including the contempt citation that defense lawyer Henry Drummond is given and a favorite scene of mine where Brady is holding court for the press in the hotel restaurant , enjoying heaping helpfuls of roast beef and mashed potatoes while Drummond sits in the foreground with a tuna sandwich and a glass or milk . The confrontation climax with Brady and Drummond is still basically the same with the added dialog about Brady maybe running for president again to bring the USA back to God . Again written for the 1988 television audience . Jason Robards , Jr . is far closer to the truth of Clarence Darrow in his Henry Drummond than Spencer Tracy . Darrow was not as noble a creature as Tracy makes him out , but his performance did get him an Academy Award nomination . Robards is a lot more sneaky , still for me the best interpretation of Clarence Darrow is Orson Welles as Jonathan Wilk in Compulsion . Kirk Douglas gets reunited with his Spartacus co-star Jean Simmons playing Mrs . Brady . By all accounts the real Mrs . Bryan was a very wise woman capable of a brake on her high flying husband when needed . When I wrote a review for the 1960 Inherit the Wind which I did see in theaters back in the day , I said that the film was done from a quaint nostalgia point of view about what silly things we believed and fought over and how America had grown up in the interim . In 1960 who would have believed that fundamentalist Christianity would have a stranglehold on one of our major parties . This version of Inherit The Wind sadly takes that into account .
Hiring It Done	In El Dorado John Wayne has occasion to remark to Ed Asner that since he doesn't carry a gun himself he hires it done . And then the Duke went on to make some remarks about the quality of his help . But the reverse of the coin is when who you hire is too good for you to argue with . That was the problem that Sebastian Cabot has with Ned Young , a brooding killer who he hires to intimidate some farmers to get off land that unbeknownst to them has oil . It was at the end of the frontier days and the great oil discoveries that were to make Texas and oil synonymous were just being discovered . One guy who won't be pushed is a Swedish farmer who Young kills . His son played by Sterling Hayden comes to town asking questions . Like Hayden in real life , the son is a seaman who's strange in that western environment . He carries no gun , but only a harpoon from his seafaring days . By this time Hayden was ready to leave Hollywood for Tahiti and was just trying to earn enough money to sail there with his kids . He'd been a friendly witness at the House Un American Activities Committee It must have been a bit strained on the set because the screenplay was by Dalton Trumbo , one of the Hollywood Ten . Trumbo was still writing under pseudonyms though . Hayden walks through his role , the real acting here is done by Ned Young and Sebastian Cabot . Both of them are a pair of hateful people , Cabot the greedy capitalist and Young the stone killer . Western fans won't be disappointed however , especially at the final confrontation at the end .
Those Farmers Have More Trouble	Do you remember how the first Magnificent Seven ended ? Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen rode off after polishing off Eli Wallach and his group of bandits . Horst Bucholtz as Chico stayed in the village and married a girl from there . The other four also stayed in six by four graves . Flash forward now to the present . One day another group of bandits sweep down on the village , they take Chico and the rest of the men as workers on a little project . They've taken the men from two other villages as well . The call is sent out for help again . Yul Brynner and Robert Fuller in Steve McQueen's role recruit four others and ride back to where they fought that battle many years earlier . Instead of the eminently practical Eli Wallach whose interest in these poor villages was for supplies during the winter for his gang . This time we're dealing with a fanatic played Emilio Fernandez who Yul Brynner has had dealings with before . He's got all these peasants working as slave labors to rebuild a church as a monument to his two dead sons . The man's trolley has definitely slipped his tracks . I guess I miss Eli Wallach from the original . I found Fernandez's character to be just too off the mark for me . I can't believe his own men are standing for what he wants . Just as Steve McQueen came from western television so does his replacement Robert Fuller , fresh from the Laramie series . Fuller is competent enough , but does not have McQueen's charisma by a stretch . Too bad they couldn't get Steve McQueen to repeat his role . The other four of the new Seven are Jordan Christopher , Claude Akins , Warren Oates , and Rudolfo Acosta . All of them fill roles that we've come to expect of them . Julian Mateos takes Horst Bucholtz's part , a more mature Chico to be sure . You could not have done this film without that wonderful Elmer Bernstein theme again . What I can't understand is why his score was nominated again as there was nothing original in it . Return of the Seven is a decent enough remake , but it ain't a patch on the original .
A Conservative Is A Liberal Who's Been Mugged	Just Cause takes some of the best parts of three films , Cape Fear , A Touch of Evil and Silence of the Lambs and mixes it together to come up with a good thriller of a film . Sean Connery is a liberal law professor , married to a former Assistant District Attorney , Kate Capshaw and he's a crusader against capital punishment . Blair Underwood's grandmother Ruby Dee buttonholes Connery at a conference and persuades him to handle her grandson's appeal . He's sitting on death row for the murder of a young girl . When Connery arrives in this rural Florida county he's up against a tough sheriff played by Laurence Fishburne who's about as ruthless in his crime solving as Orson Welles was in Touch of Evil . Later on after Connery gets the verdict set aside with evidence he's uncovered , he's feeling pretty good about himself . At that point the film takes a decided turn from Touch of Evil to Cape Fear . To say that all is not what it seems is to put it mildly . The cast uniformly turns in some good performances . Special mention must be made of Ed Harris who plays a Hannibal Lecter like serial killer on death row with Underwood . He will make your skin crawl and he starts making Connery rethink some of those comfortable liberal premises he's been basing his convictions on . Many a confirmed liberal I've known has come out thinking quite differently once they've become a crime victim . Of course the reverse is equally true . Many a law and order conservative if they ever get involved on the wrong end of the criminal justice system wants to make real sure all his rights are indeed guaranteed . Criminal justice is not an end , but a process and a never ending one at that for all society . I guess if Just Cause has a moral that would probably be it .
Will That John Henry Lee Ever Reform ?	Director Burt Kennedy took the same foursome of Texas Rangers from the Over The Hill Gang of 1969 and now has given them a new quest . Captain Richard Widmark is on the trail of Willie Nelson , an old war buddy from the Confederate Army and now a bank robber , who's back to his old tricks again . Only this time some young guns led by former teen bubble gum idol Shaun Cassidy have stolen the loot that Nelson and his gang had stolen from the gang in Del Rio . Widmark and his cronies , Chuck Connors , Jack Elam , and Stuart Whitman turn out to have a lot more in common with the old outlaws , Nelson , Dub Taylor , Ken Curtis , Royal Dano , and Gene Evans than they think . This group of old character actors were what made the movies so enjoyable back then . They had faces and identities you couldn't miss . We should all thank Burt Kennedy for assembling this whole crew for a last roundup . As Willie Nelson says they may be old , but they are professionals and that's what counts when the chips are down . There's a romantic subplot here . Widmark has always suspected his wife Angie Dickinson of having a yen for Nelson back in the day . That's a good deal of the reason he's pursuing Nelson with such vehemence . It's a treat to see all these old timers again and the film is worth seeing just to see Jack Elam trade in his horse for a bicycle to keep up with the times .
Those Old Cavalry Flicks	Watching The Wild Geese puts me so in mind of those old John Ford cavalry flicks . Not surprising since the Director Andrew McLaglen learned his trade while on the set of those films with his father Victor McLaglen . A fine cast was assembled here for this film . Richard Burton , Roger Moore , and Richard Harris certainly have all done better stuff , but their skill makes The Wild Geese enjoyable . Of the three , I think Harris comes off the best , his scenes with his young son are very poignant . Richard Burton is a mercenary who is being offered a contract by gazillionaire industrialist Stewart Granger . Train and equip a group of mercenaries to rescue a Nelson Mandela type African leader who has been deposed in a military coup . Burton does the job , but when the job is finished he and his mercenaries find getting out a whole lot more than the bargained for . Starting with Where Eagles Dare , Burton was trying the action / adventure genre on for size and he did well with that . He came up way short with Raid on Rommel , but recouped quite a bit with The Wild Geese . It was his only joint film venture with Richard Harris , pairing both the stage and screen King Arthurs from Camelot . Of course action adventure is old hat for Roger Moore . He was in his prime as James Bond when The Wild Geese was done . But Moore shows he can be quite serious here . None of the tongue in cheek deadpan that characterizes a Bond film . The scenes dealing with the recruiting a training of the mercenaries come straight out of John Ford . So are the various types among the soldiers . I liked Kenneth Griffith's portrayal of the openly gay medic with the group . Yes he's certainly stereotypical , but the point is he's accepted by the men who really don't care about his sexual orientation when in a fight . Secondly he turns out to be quite the John Wayne type hero in the end . The Wild Geese turned out to be very popular , Burton was going to do a sequel Wild Geese II when he died in 1983 . Might have been interesting had he done it since it would have paired with Laurence Olivier in that one . The Wild Geese is an action / adventure film to be sure , but it's also about loyalty , tradition , and camaraderie . These men may fight for a good paycheck , but they are fanatically loyal to the unit created and to each other . If that ain't John Ford . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
An Eerie Parallel	Though They All Kissed The Bride dated a bit with the outbreak of World War II , it still holds up well today . Joan Crawford did a very fine job stepping in for Carole Lombard as the trucking company CEO who gets brought down romantically by the charming Melvyn Douglas . It's easy to see why Harry Cohn wanted Douglas in the part , the film is a domestic version of Ninotchka . Douglas is a crusading reporter writing an article about the abuses in a trucking company where they seem not to have heard of the Wagner Act . Joan Crawford is the daughter of the firm's founder who steps in to run the place after dad's demise . Don't let her sex fool you , she's all business until she meets up with Melvyn Douglas . In fairness to her , Crawford is stepping up to the plate with an apparently scatterbrained Billie Burke for a mother and a princess d√©butante in Helen Parrish as a sister not capable of doing much of anything . In an eerie parallel in real life , after her fourth husband Alfred Steele from Pepsi Cola died , Crawford went into the business world with a vengeance and her years in Hollywood turned out to be a training ground for that new field of endeavor . Best moment is Crawford and Allen Jenkins winning a jitterbug contest when she goes to the company banquet incognito . Though I can see this film would have suited Carole Lombard better , Joan Crawford does just fine in this bright comedy .
Scandalous Doings On The Mayflower	In doing a review of Plymouth Adventure we should start out by saying this is most definitely not a docudrama about the Pilgrims . This is a film adaption of a novel by Ernest Gebler in which the author threw some things in there that never happened or are the subject of much speculation . Gene Tierney's character of Dorothy Bradford did in fact drown under unknown circumstances , but there is no reason to think it was suicide as opposed to an accident and her yearnings for Captain William Jones of the Mayflower is just part of the Gebler's fertile imagination . He was certainly imaginative enough giving a little scandalous romance into the Puritan community . Plymouth Adventure is a nice tribute to those brave and hearty souls who set forth into an unknown land in which half of them died the first winter , but those who survived creating an American national tradition in the Thanksgiving Holiday . And a black day for turkeys everywhere . Lately the religious right has latched on to the Pilgrims in their efforts to prove America is a Christian nation . Of course once they got here they ran what became the Massachusetts Bay Colony as a theocracy . Still they were an intrepid lot and their courage is beyond question . Spencer Tracy gives a fine performance as the rugged and cynical sea captain of the Mayflower , the chartered ship which takes the Pilgrims from Southampton to an unknown world . I think Tracy drew a lot from some of the characters in Eugene O'Neill's plays in his portrayal of Jones . He has a moment in which he says that people have disappointed him , but the sea never let him down . Could have come from any of O'Neill's works . An Oscar for Best Special Effects went to Plymouth Adventure showing some of the travails at sea the Mayflower went through . Back in its day MGM had a huge water tank that was used for all the sea sagas filmed there . Occasionally other studios rented it out , the facility was that good . Tracy has been there before when he was in Captains Courageous in spirit so to speak . Players like Van Johnson , Lowell Gilmore , Dawn Addams , Noel Drayton , Barry Jones , Kathleen Lockhart play some of the Pilgrim names come down from historical legend . Leo Genn is William Bradford , author of the Mayflower Compact which is cited interminably now by fundamentalist TV reverends as proof of our Christian heritage . Genn who rivaled Ronald Colman as possessor of the most beautiful speaking voice in the English speaking world would be a pleasure to listen to reading the Erie County phone book . My favorite in this is young Tommy Ivo who played William Button the only voyager on the Mayflower to die at sea . His death scene is a heart string tugging experience . Not the real story of the Mayflower voyage , Plymouth Adventure is still good entertainment and a stirring tribute to those who formalized the giving of thanks and the reasons they had to be thankful .
The Vigilante Goes Into Business	The Death Wish films are not my favorite Charles Bronson works . But there's no doubt that Bronson attained his enduring popularity on the strength of the five films in the series . In this the original Death Wish , Charles Bronson introduces us to Paul Kersey , successful architect and family man with wife Hope Lange and married daughter Kathleen Tolan . Bronson's well ordered life takes an abrupt change when a home invasion robbery results in the death of Hope Lange and the rape of Kathleen Tolan . All the acting is done with facial expressions here . Bronson usually plays stoic characters in his films , but in the Death Wish series he never articulates what's going on with him , but you see it in a face that was made for movie closeups in the same way that Gary Cooper's and John Wayne's faces were . A trip out west on a project brings him in touch with a different mentality about settling urban problems and the present of a 32 Caliber pistol from the man he was contracted to work for gives Bronson a whole new outlook . And a mission in life to rid the world of street criminals . 1974 may have been the year Richard Nixon had his downfall , but this was the president elected on a law and order platform . George Wallace sent his audiences into delight when he talked about running protesters down with his vehicle . Death Wish struck quite a nerve with the American public because unlike Dirty Harry , Bronson was a citizen like you and me who just decided to act . There are two really good supporting performances in Death Wish . A New Yorker to his fingertips , Vincent Gardenia plays the dogged police detective who's put on the vigilante killer case . And Stuart Margolin as Bronson's western host who presents him with the tool of his trade is also worth noting . In 1982 Bronson finally due to a lot of audience demand and the fact that the money was too good to turn down , repeated his role of Paul Kersey in a series of Death Wish films of varying quality . Nothing like this one though .
Getting Katie A Monument	Feisty Katie Elder has passed on and her sons have arrived in Clearwater , Texas for her funeral . Katie's four sons are played by John Wayne , Dean Martin , Earl Holliman , and Michael Anderson , Jr . and three's a certain amount of hostility directed towards them from some quarters . And a bit of fear evident in the town's people . It also turns out that their father had been murdered a few months before that and their ranch now belonged to James Gregory . When questions are asked , trouble starts . One thing is clear though , none of her kids has quite turned out the way she hoped , but the three oldest are going to see that young Anderson becomes some kind of success in life . Despite some glaring plot weaknesses The Sons of Katie Elder is a film that is sold by the sincere playing of its leads . I'm not quite sure why the Elder boys didn't come back with the news of their father's death and settled things back then . Or why Michael Anderson was so resistant to some higher education . This was a special film for John Wayne , the first post cancer operation film he made . And he did it and all his subsequent films with essentially one lung . One thing about Duke was that he really loved MAKING movies . I've always thought on some level he wanted them to make money because that way he could make more of them . Wayne just loved being out on location , working all day and partying all night , this was him . Although his health gradually deteriorated and he became more testy and irritable and he had more and more need of an oxygen tank as years past , he wouldn't give it up until he HAD to . For John Wayne it really was a labor of love . Wayne surrounded himself with a good cast of familiar players for the most part . This was his second film with Dean Martin who after completing this film started on his highly acclaimed variety show . And his guest on his first show , John Wayne to plug the upcoming release of their film . They are an interesting pair of older Elder brothers . Wayne who lives by a strict code and Martin who gets by on his wits and a larcenous streak . Still the affection the two had for each other in real life comes forth on the screen . Dino has a real moment to shine when he sneaks out and brings Dennis Hopper back to the stable where Wayne and a wounded Anderson are holed up . One of his best acted scenes from any of his films . George Kennedy plays a menacing gunman that James Gregory hires and he also gets quite a clout from John Wayne with a two by four after Kennedy was bullying John Doucette . It's a great cinematic moment from a Wayne film , but afterwards you can't find any trace of injury on Kennedy for the rest of the film . I remember in Joe Kidd when Clint Eastwood gave Don Stroud a similar clout , Mr . Stroud looked every bit the injured party for the rest of that film . Though we never see Katie Elder we get quite the picture of the uncomplaining pioneer mother through the townspeople that knew her and their sons . I'm still also not sure though why Earl Holliman was supposed to be such a bad role model , he's a hardware merchant in another town . Still the other three Elder boys want Anderson to aim higher than that . Elmer Bernstein's musical score is one of the best that is featured in a John Wayne film . Wayne films were always distinguished by good use of music , something the Duke learned from John Ford . Bernstein and the Duke first worked together in The Comancheros and this one is every bit as good as that rousing score . The action sequences are the best part of the film and the last half hour with the ambush on the bridge by Gregory's men right up to the explosive climatic battle with Wayne and Gregory , the excitement doesn't let up for a New York minute . No western fan should miss it .
" When You Run Out Of Places , Home Is All You Have Left "	In a recent biography of Barbara Stanwyck we are told that Stanwyck overcame her natural conservatism to do this adaption of a Clifford Odets play . Many changes were made to overcome not only Stanwyck's qualms , but those of RKO studio owner Howard Hughes about the work of the left leaning Odets . Clash By Night was one of Odets's lesser works , in fact it was a flop on Broadway only running 49 performances in the 1941-1942 season . The original play takes place on Staten Island and all of Odets's left wing views are taken out of the film and it becomes a standard triangle drama . On Broadway the roles played by Stanwyck , Paul Douglas , and Robert Ryan were originated by Tallulah Bankhead , Lee J . Cobb , and Joseph Schildkraut . One look at that original cast and you know the interpretations had to be different . Robert Ryan was also in the Broadway play in the part of Stanwyck's younger brother played in the film by Keith Andes . Stanwyck has returned home to a fishing village , a woman who's been around the block more than a few times . Honest fisherman Paul Douglas offers her security and she marries him for it . But his bad boy friend Robert Ryan offers her more than that . Marilyn Monroe has a key supporting role as Andes ' wife . She was just starting to get some real notice and she was also starting to become one royal pain to work with . The story goes she flubbed a scene with Stanwyck many times and Stanwyck took it all quite philosophically saying that when you had a body like her's you didn't need to act . Marilyn did eventually get it right though and her performance is important her as her husband fears the bad ways of his sister might just rub off on her . Fritz Lang directed the film , Monroe must have driven that particular set drillmaster nuts . Still he did get good performances out of his cast with a script diluted of all social significance . Maybe the dilution is what turned a bad play into a good film .
Rock Pushing The Envelope	Let me tell you this is one special favor that Charles Boyer is asking of Rock Hudson . My guess is that Hudson's estate is keeping a lid on this one . Boyer has a daughter in Leslie Caron who is a psychiatrist by profession . He also has a colleague at work in Rock Hudson and he's concerned about his daughter . Concerned his daughter is not getting any sex . This is a new twist on the normal Rock Hudson comedies . In two of the ones he made with Doris Day , Rock's your normal every day American wolf trying very hard to make the all-American virgin Doris Day . Here Caron is a French virgin , well into her thirties . As Boyer tries ever so tactfully to put it , what a father might be proud of in a daughter at age 18 doesn't hold true when she's 38 . As he puts it Rock , he expects him to to the deed with Caron and expose her to what she's been missing . What a favor to be asking . A Very Special Favor then follows the usual capers that these films for Rock Hudson normally do . But the end is really an unusual one . Deciding that maybe he ought to appeal to her professionally as well , Hudson let it be known he's gay and he has switchboard operator Nita Talbot dress up in drag and pretend to be a most effeminate male . Psychiatrist Caron races to the hotel room where Hudson and Talbot are to do the deed and at that point Caron sacrifices all including bachelorhood to save Rock from the love that dares not speak its name . I think it's rather obvious why this film isn't shown at all . What puzzles me is why Hudson who was oh so careful about keeping his homosexuality a secret would do a role like this . Maybe it's the reason why a lot of closeted gay men troll the docks for dates , hoping to have the question of exiting the closet forced on them . I leave that to the psychiatrists . A friend told me that he was at a party at someone's house and a video of one of Rock Hudson's films was being shown . This was a pretty straight crowd he was in and Rock in the macho role he was in was getting not a few hoots from the audience . This wasn't the film they were viewing , but imagine if it was with what we know now . My guess is A Very Special Favor will not be shown any time soon or be out on DVD or VHS . But if it does come out or is shown on TCM or AMC catch it by all means . You try and figure out what was going on in the mind of Rock Hudson .
Another somebody done somebody wrong picture	Burt Lancaster usually played parts with a lot of depth to them , especially after From Here to Eternity . In fact other than Vengeance Valley , the only other film where he played a totally upright hero is Gunfight at the OK Corral . He's the orphan kid that gets taken in by rancher Ray Collins who grows up and becomes foreman and companion to Robert Walker , Collins's real son . Walker is a spoiled kid and Lancaster is constantly cleaning up after him . Some of the same plot elements were used later in Man From Laramie and The Big Country . Walker is both coming home to his wife , Joanne Dru and another girl he's fathered a kid with , Sally Forrest . Lancaster is caught taking hush money over to Forrest by her no-account brothers , John Ireland and Hugh O'Brian . They come to the conclusion that Lancaster has done the deed . That's where the action starts . Good western with some adult themes . Cattle drive scenes are tough and gritty , they don't have the epic quality of Red River , but are nicely done . The players all give a good account of themselves .
Knocking the Axe Out Of the Axis	They Got Me Covered is one of two films Bob Hope did on loan out from Paramount to Sam Goldwyn . After that Goldwyn once again signed his own house comedian Danny Kaye so he wouldn't have to pay an exorbitant ransom Paramount put on Hope's talents . Hope's a bumbling newspaper reporter who turned out to be the only wire service man who did not get the story of the German invasion of the Soviet Union . That got him fired by boss editor Donald MacBride in one of his patented movie temper tantrums , If you can believe it Hope actually won a Pulitzer Prize , but we soon learn the reason for it . He's got a Rumanian source named Venescu played by John Abbott . Abbott's got another big story for him , but he manages to get himself killed . Hope and ever suffering gal pal Dorothy Lamour have to find out what happened . This could have been the plot line for any number of melodramatic noir type films , but this is a Bob Hope film so we're talking satire of same . Hope gets a lot of help from a very good cast of players Sam Goldwyn assembled here . Representing the Axis are Otto Preminger , Philip Ahn , and Eduardo Ciannelli plus a very seductive Lenore Aubert as the traditional femme fatale . Best moments for me are those that Hope has with Donald Meek playing an addled old caretaker who believes the Civil War is still going on . The two of them reprise a couple of old burlesque routines in Abbott and Costello style . Also look for a really nice performance by brassy blond Marion Martin as stripper Gloria the Glo-Girl . They Got Me Covered despite the dated World War II topical references still has quite a lot of laughs for today's audience .
The Darndest casting decisions	Back in the day of the big studio system , the darndest casting decisions were made . Good old all American James Stewart appearing as a Hungarian in The Shop Around the Corner . Had I been casting the film , the part of Kralik would have been perfect for Charles Boyer . His accent mixed in with all the other European accents would have been nothing . Stewart had some of the same problem in the Mortal Storm also with Margaret Sullavan . Margaret Sullavan was his most frequent leading lady on the screen , he did four films with her . But is only this one where neither of them dies . Sullavan and her husband Leland Heyward knew Stewart back in the day when he was a struggling player in New York . In fact Sullavan's husband was Stewart's good friend Henry Fonda back then . I think only Clark Gable was able to carry off being an American in a cast of non-Americans in Mutiny on the Bounty . Stewart in The Mortal Storm was German , but all the other players were American as well so nothing stood out . But if you can accept Stewart , than you'll be seeing a fine film from Ernest Lubitsch . The plot is pretty simple , a man and woman working in a department store in Budapest don't get along in person . But it seems that they are carrying on a correspondence with some anonymous admirers which turn out to be each other . Also employer Frank Morgan suspects Stewart wrongly of kanoodling with his wife . Though the leads are fine and Frank Morgan departs from his usual befuddled self , the two players who come off best are Felix Bressart and Joseph Schildkraut . Bressart has my favorite moments in the film when he takes off after Morgan starts asking people for opinions . He makes himself very scarce . And Joseph Schildkraut , who is always good , is just great as the officious little worm who is constantly kissing up to Frank Morgan . You really hate people like that , I've known too many like Schildkraut in real life who are at office politics 24 hours a day . Sad that it pays off a good deal of the time .
Everyone Wants Meg's Money	Masquerade is a really good Hitchcockian type of thriller , a combination of Suspicion and The Heiress in which sisters Joan Fontaine and Olivia DeHavilland brought aspects of Meg Tilly's character in their Oscar winning performances . It was shot on location in the ritzy Hamptons of Suffolk County , in fact the plot is about the haves and have nots of the area . And that's an area where the haves have PLENTY . One of those haves is Meg Tilly heir to a $300 , 000 . 000 . 00 fortune . She's a nice kid who properly wonders whether the men who court like her for her or bank account . She's got one leach of a stepfather in John Glover , a character you just love to hate . But by the terms of her mother's will she can't get rid of him until she's 21 . And he's a guy who's used to a very high lifestyle . Tilly's also got two men in her life . Local boy Doug Savant whose father works in the shipyard on the yachts of the rich and famous who has joined the town police force . He's been crushing out on her since he was a little kid . But the Hamptons do have their own caste system . And then into her life comes Rob Lowe , the handsome and mysterious stranger who captains Brian Davies yacht and on the side kanoodles with his wife , Kim Cattrall . He puts the moves on Tilly and since its Rob Lowe , who could blame a girl . Tilly's the innocent here , that's a constant , but as the story continues and several murders take place , she doesn't know who to trust . You won't know because the plot takes several twists and the motives of the persons in the cast change over the course of the film . For those of you Rob Lowe fans of both genders you can have ample opportunity to see him in several stages of undress with Kim Cattrall and Meg Tilly . He's also got an interesting scene with Doug Savant who looks pretty good himself that takes on some homoerotic overtones . What beautiful children those two would have if possible . The title Masquerade refers both to the name of the Tilly family yacht and the fact that except for Tilly , a lot of these characters are not as they appear on the surface . Masquerade is a really good thriller of a film , don't miss it when it is shown .
Heston Fulfills A Dream	One of Charlton Heston's great disappointments in his career was that he did not get to do the original film of A Man For All Seasons . Heston couldn't really complain though , Paul Scofield had done the play on the London stage and Heston never faulted Scofield's Academy Award winning performance . But he made sure he did get to do another screen version after appearing on stage in the production of Robert Bolt's play . He did something else too , what you see Heston in is how it actually was originally presented on stage with the Everyman Character , done here by Roy Kinnear , as a narrator . When Bolt did the 1966 version for the screen , he adapted his own work and dropped the Everyman character probably because Fred Zinneman who directed the film wanted it that way . I believe Zinneman was right that what he did was better suited for the screen . That's not to decry Heston's performance because as a man who made a career out of playing great men of character and integrity , Thomas More was definitely a role he was most suited for . I can certainly understand his disappointment . By the way , Heston's other goal never realized was to do Abraham Lincoln , but I'm guessing he never got a suitable script or story . With son Fraser Clarke Heston as producer , I'm sure Heston got to pick who he would appear with and we are fortunate to have John Gielgud as Cardinal Wolsey , though Orson Welles in build and in acting style was much more suited for the role . Heston's very good friend from across the pond , Richard Johnson , got to play the key role of the Duke of Norfolk . Though this production of A Man For All Seasons suffers from comparison to the Paul Scofield version , it can definitely stand on its own merits and Charlton Heston and the rest of the cast have nothing to be ashamed of .
It's All On The Line For Glenn Ford	I happen to like submarine movies , but normally the plot situations are the same in every one of them . Torpedo Run though it bares most resemblance to the Cary Grant World War II film from Warner Brothers , Torpedo Run has a unique involvement of Ford's family in combat . Japanese intelligence has marked Ford as one of America's top submarine commanders so when on a mission , Ford receives word that his wife and three young daughters have been accounted for in the Phillipines and are being held by the Japanese , you've got to wonder . The Swiss government which did the liaison work during World War II regarding prisoner information and exchange has just gotten word about Diane Brewster and the daughters . The devilish orientals have something up their sleeves all right . A transport ship with the civilian prisoners is screening the new pride of the Japanese fleet , one humongous aircraft carrier . That's not something Cary Grant faced in Destination Tokyo or any other American submarine skipper in any other film I remember . It's a grim Glenn Ford we see doing his duty in World War II . Only Executive officer Ernest Borgnine knows exactly what's at stake for Ford and he's reliable and supportive . The flashback sequences before the war involving Ford and Brewster are poignant and contribute to the overall tension of Torpedo Run . The combat and rescue sequences are well staged . Torpedo Run is a good portrait of a man under tremendous stress . My guess is that Ford was cast in this role seeing how well he performed in another film involving a pressure situation , Ransom . Glenn Ford's legion of fans and fans of World War II films in general will applaud Torpedo Run .
Nyah , Nyah , you can't catch me	Catch Me If You Can should be seen back to back with Tony Curtis's performance in The Great Imposter . They are both excellent films and both deal with a protagonist who's a brilliant and charming fellow and a quick study who masquerades in many disguises . In The Great Imposter the whole story is told from Tony Curtis's point of view . And it's more lighthearted in its treatment of Ferdinand Waldo Demara than this is of Frank Abagnale , Jr . Curtis's father Gary Merrill only has a few minutes in the beginning of The Great Imposter , but enough to establish the relationship there . Leonardo DiCaprio and Christopher Walken as son and father have a great deal more screen time together . And of course in Catch Me If You Can we also have the point of view of the man trying to catch young Abegnale , FBI agent Tom Hanks . Remember this was the Sixties and J . Edgar Hoover was running the agency . Hanks is great as the uptight , buttondown agent in the Hoover mold . One of the best scenes in the film is DiCaprio conning Hanks out of an arrest by pretending to be a Secret Service Man and humiliating him in the process . He also turns Hanks into a man with a mission . DiCaprio is a middle class kid from Westchester County whose father suffers some business reversals like Gary Merrill did in The Great Imposter . He refuses to accept a change in lifestyle and because he's bright , he develops into a master check forger . He masquerades as an airline pilot , a lawyer , and a doctor and steals millions of dollars and lives high on the hog . Another scene I like is DiCaprio entertaining a high class model at a five star hotel and then we cut to Hanks doing his laundry at some cheap laundromat . Steven Spielberg allowed Walken to develop his father character a whole lot more than Gary Merrill did in The Great Imposter . This man for whom the American Dream became a nightmare got a deserved Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor . The Great Imposter with its accent on entertaining never allowed Tony Curtis to develop Demara's character as DiCaprio did with Abegnale . Basically DiCaprio finds it easy to con people because people do want to believe the best in you . Ironically he develops a telephone relationship with his pursuer in the same way Curtis had with his parish priest , Karl Malden . The reason is simple , Hanks is the only guy who knows what makes him tick . And in the end Hanks is the guy who provides a useful outlet for DiCaprio's talents . I like the way Spielberg developed his characters in this film . We get good three dimensional portrayals from DiCaprio , Hanks and Walken . It's a great film about another amazing adventure .
" Those Frenchies Seek Him Everywhere . "	There are some including previous reviewers here who would argue that The Scarlet Pimpernel afforded Leslie Howard his finest screen role . I wouldn't argue the point . This Pimpernel guy , a sort of English Zorro / Lone Ranger is one tricky fellow . He's declared his own private war on the French Revolution and while not prancing about Regency society , he's over in France rescuing as many aristocrats as he can from Madame Guillotine . Like Zorro in order to throw off suspicion , Sir Percy Blakeney affects the guise of a fop so that no one will think him capable of anything bold . Unlike Don Diego De La Vega , Blakeney's a married man , married to a French woman played by Merle Oberon who has her own dirty little secrets she's keeping . Come to think of Don Diego and Sir Percy were operating in roughly the same period . There's a guy named Chauvelin who's got a mission from the head guy at the Revolution , Robespierre himself . Bring back the Scarlet Pimpernel to face Revolutionary justice or you will . That's one great incentive . Raymond Massey is a ruthless hunter as Chauvelin . And he believes in his mission . As another reviewer quite plainly put it Massey well remembers all the excesses that the aristocrats indulged in for centuries . He's pretty good too , but Leslie Howard is a tad better . Leslie Howard is one of those players you can listen to and never be bored . He had that marvelous ability to make some of the most trite dialog sound like Shakespeare . As did his fellow British players Ronald Colman and Robert Donat . No one ever played the jaded world weary soul quite the way Howard did , whether it was Alan Squire , Ashley Wilkes or Percy Blakeney . The Scarlet Pimpernel after over 70 years holds up well as classic entertainment . No one , but a jaded regency fop could not like this film .
" The Dreams That You Inspire , With Every Sweet Desire , Be My Love "	With the success that Mario Lanza and Kathryn Grayson had in That Midnight Kiss , MGM knew it had a box office team of appeal . The following year the two of them moved from contemporary Philadelphia to pre-World War I , New Orleans . People paid their money to hear Mario sing and really didn't care about the plots of his films . Lanza was cast as an opera singing truck driver in That Midnight Kiss , as an opera singer drafted into the army in Because You're Mine , and the greatest opera singer of all in The Great Caruso . I think we can see a pattern forming here . In The Toast of New Orleans Lanza plays a shrimp fisherman who works on the boat with his uncle J . Carrol Naish . When opera singer Kathryn Grayson comes to town , Lanza boisterously and impulsively joins her in a duet of Be My Love . Her manager and New Orleans opera kingpin , David Niven is as impressed as everyone else was in 1950 with Mario's voice . He's even willing to overlook to some extent the fact he's moving in on Grayson . Acting wise The Toast of New Orleans is no strain on anybody . Mario and Kathryn play a pair of singers and Mario as in all of his films , just played himself . It's interesting that the only times he attempted to play a role from classic operetta , The Student Prince and The Vagabond King it didn't work out for him . As for David Niven , he's as debonair and charming as he always was . Niven carried more films on the strength of his charm than any other star in the sound era . But no one worried about acting and a plot in this film . Like That Midnight Kiss , The Toast of New Orleans has a nice mixture of classical opera and some good songs by Nicholas Brodzsky and Sammy Cahn to round out a very full score . One of the songs , Be My Love , became Mario Lanza's signature song , his biggest selling record on RCA Victor Red Seal label . You could not go ANYWHERE in 1950 without hearing Be My Love coming out of some radio . Be My Love was nominated for Best Song in 1950 , but lost to Mona Lisa . Norman Taurog directed Mario in this film , he had previously won an Oscar for Skippy and had directed Spencer Tracy to his second Academy Award in Boy's Town . Taurog was an interesting choice for a director to pilot a picture with a personality like Lanza . Later on Taurog would end his career directing nine of Elvis Presley's feature films , another instance of him directing a mega-pop personality successfully . The Toast of New Orleans is for Mario Lanza fans everywhere and this review is dedicated to my father who was a big fan .
Four Men And A Girl on the Trail	The Naked Spur is another fine western put together by the team of Director Anthony Mann and player James Stewart . Spectacular location photography in the Rocky Mountains lend a ring of authenticity to the story . That story being Stewart as a bounty hunter on the trail of outlaw / killer Robert Ryan who has a girl a long with him in the attractive form of Janet Leigh . Getting Ryan proves too much so he has to enlist the aid of prospector Millard Mitchell and army deserter Ralph Meeker . Getting Ryan and Leigh back to collect the reward makes up the bulk of the film . Ryan is one evil , but very sly rogue as he works to turn the men against each other . His is the best performance in a small cast of seasoned performers each of one is fine in his / her part . The final shoot out is a really well done climax of the story . Alliances shift and not everyone is among the living when the film is over . In fact the title of the picture gives a hint of how James Stewart uses a spur in a unique manner against Ryan . For fans of westerns and I think non-western fans will find the drama and interaction among the characters entertaining .
Staying Alive and Well Lit	If The Man in the White Suit had been done in America , can't you see either Danny Kaye or Jerry Lewis trying on Alec Guinness's Sidney Stratton on for size ? This is one of the best of Alec Guinness's films and certainly one of the best that Ealing Studios in the United Kingdom ever turned out . It's so perfectly fits within the time frame of the new Labour government and the society it was trying to build . It's amazing how in times of crisis capital and labor can agree . Alec Guinness this meek little schnook of a man is obsessed with the idea that he can invent clothing that will never need cleaning , that in fact repels all kinds of foreign matter the minute it touches the garment . He's a persistent cuss and he does succeed . Of course the implications haven't really been thought through about the kind of impact clothing like that will have on society . In the end everyone is chasing him down like they would a fugitive , almost like Peter Lorre from M or Orson Welles in The Stranger or even Robert Newton in Oliver Twist . It's the mark of a great comedy film that a potentially serious situation like that chase as described in some of the serious films I've mentioned can be played for laughs . Poor Guinness's suit is not only white and stain repellent , but it glows like a neon sign . Other than Guinness the best performances are from Cecil Parker as yet another pompous oaf , Joan Greenwood as his siren daughter and Ernest Thesiger the biggest clothing manufacturer in the UK > Come to think of it , did Paramount borrow that suit from Ealing and give it to John Travolta for Saturday Night Fever ?
At The Birth Of Freedom	It's possible that if John Ford's health had permitted him to finish Young Cassidy we might have gotten a better version of how Sean O'Casey saw himself in this world . The film is based on his autobiography where he himself decided to rename the central character Cassidy . I'm guessing that was to allow for a bit of dramatic license . As if anybody with the slightest familiarity in Irish history isn't going to know who wrote The Plough And The Stars . O'Casey who was somewhat of a curmudgeon in his old age as was John Ford might have appealed to one another , one curmudgeon to another . In fact Ford directed the film version of The Plough And The Stars , a much underrated film which had a little too much Ford and not enough O'Casey in it . Anyway Ford dropped the project and acclaimed British cinematographer Jack Cardiff picked up the ball . The usual roughhouse Ford type monkeyshine comedy could have been dropped in a few places during this film , might have given it a lift . O'Casey ( Cassidy ) comes from a hardscrabble background , a brilliant mind though that couldn't be kept down by poverty . He's one of several offspring in a house presided over by the wise and patient Flora Robson in a part that Jane Darwell would have done in America a generation earlier . She and Sian Phillips as his sister deliver some fine performances . The title role is played by Rod Taylor who was at the apex of his career at the time . He does a splendid job in capturing the youthful vitality and intelligence of a laboring man with a vision and a voice to capture what he sees . In fact his vision too accurate for some and I'm not talking about the occupying English . O'Casey as played by Taylor reminded me almost hauntingly of George Gershwin as he was portrayed by Robert Alda in Rhapsody in Blue . Gershwin like O'Casey was so driven by his art that in the end no woman ever bonded with him intellectually . O'Casey as well is ultimately driven so by his need to express that the women are both attracted and feel inadequate for him . Everyone from young Julie Christie as a tart , to prim bookseller Maggie Smith in two of their earliest screen roles . The end when Smith tells Taylor she can't go on with him is a haunting one . I've never been to Dublin so I'm not sure how much it has changed from the years of the Rebellion to the Sixties , let alone a new century . But Jack Cardiff's cinematographer's eye does a great job in capturing same . Ditto in fact for the scenes in the Irish countryside which are as beautifully photographed as Ford's classic The Quiet Man . Sean O'Casey can well lay claim to being Ireland's first man of letters and that's bucking some heavy competition like George Bernard Shaw and Oscar Wilde for instance . But those two worthy writers got their main success abroad , O'Casey wrote and told the story of his people in the fashion of the hated Cromwell , ' warts and all . ' His story is Ireland's at the birth of freedom .
A Lot Of Faith	Father Flannagan said there was no such thing as a bad boy and founded Boys Town to prove his theory . With only one test case , but a real hard case , priest Cesar Romero has that particular theory tested by young Roger Mobley . Mobley was 14 at the time he made The Runaway and he had done a similar role as a Mexican street kid in Dime With A Halo . Here he's an orphan urchin who sleeps in a room in a barn and hustles for whatever money he can make . All the time he's looking for his father . He stows away in a truck driven by Father Cesar Romero , but gets stopped at the border crossing . The officials of both sides of the border give him over in custody to Romero . Oh , there was another stowaway on the truck , a young puppy that Mobley took with him that turns out to be a greyhound . One fast greyhound to boot . The dog turns out to be Mobley's salvation . The Runaway is a heartwarming boy and his dog story shot completely on location in Tijuana , San Diego and many points in between in the USA and Mexico . On the shelf for 45 years , it just made its debut on television on TCM . I wonder what Roger Mobley must be thinking , 45 years to see what could be his best performance as a juvenile .
A Barrymore You've Not Seen Before	Watching Topaze this morning I was amazed at how well John Barrymore was playing the title role in this film and how he seemed to be getting inspiration from Frank Morgan . Then I did some research and found out that in the American debut of Marcel Pagnol's play Frank Morgan did indeed play the lead . The play ran for 215 performances on Broadway in 1930 and it concerns a French school teacher who's a rather old fashioned pedantic fellow who believes the simple maxims of life about honesty and decency . His reputation is such that an unscrupulous industrialist wants to use his name on a soft drink that is not manufactured with the highest of standards . When he finds out and how he deals with it are the subject of Topaze and let's just say this mild mannered school teacher turns out to be more than capable of dealing with the cold and cruel outside world . John Barrymore never did anything quite like Topaze or at least I've not seen it . You can best compare this performance to a couple of Frank Morgan roles . It's very much like his Professor Roth in The Mortal Storm although the results are far happier for the title character . Myrna Loy is on hand as the mistress of Baron Reginald Mason and gives a good account of herself as does Mason as the unscrupulous industrialist . You can see why Mason's doing a little kanoodling with Loy on the side when you get a look at Jobyna Howland , the Baroness . Let's just say she's formidable . Loy would soon follow Barrymore to MGM from where he was being loaned out for Topaze by Louis B . Mayer to his son-in-law , David O . Selznick the producer . Selznick would also opt for MGM soon . But director Harry d'Abbadie d'Arrast would depart for Europe shortly unable to work within the constraints of the Hollywood studio system . He did a great job here , possibly in another era he would have had a more substantial American career . For a John Barrymore you've not seen before I recommend Topaze .
Reely Something	Indiscreet is one of the great examples of the multiple advantages of film over the live performance . The film was taken from a play on Broadway entitled Kind Sir that had almost a year's run and starred Charles Boyer and Mary Martin . The entire play is set in the apartment of the leading lady . Stanley Donen didn't settle for that . He used the entire city of London as a set and the day and night life of London is glitteringly photographed in technicolor . This film has only seven speaking parts , but all the glitz hides that beautifully . We're talking here about romance among the very upper crust . Ingrid Bergman is a world famous actress getting on in years , but still looking sharp and looking for love . Cary Grant is a sophisticated diplomat who avoids marriage by making up a fictitious wife that he says will not divorce him . Now those roles are hardly an acting stretch for those two leading players , but I defy anyone to come up with better casting . Indiscreet has a nice title song that is only heard instrumentally , but Frank Sinatra fans will find the James Van Heusen-Sammy Cahn song on one of his albums . Too bad it wasn't sung in the film . Cary Grant has always been one leading man who has never been afraid of doing some very physical comedy in his films . Arsenic and Old Lace and The Bachelor and The Bobby Soxer come immediately to mind , but Indiscreet has one of my favorite Cary Grant moments . During a black tie and tuxedo affair , a foursome reel is called . Grant doesn't have the foggiest idea how to do the foursome reel , but he does one grand job at trying to fake it and the other dancers enjoy his impromptu efforts as did this member of the audience . No deep messages in Indiscreet , just good old entertainment brought to us a by a leading man and lady still with fans the world over .
" I'll Make Men of Them Before I'm Through . "	John McIntire approaches wagonmaster Robert Taylor with an interesting job and challenge . He wants to bring brides west to the settlement he's founded in the southwest United States . Taylor hires on a bunch of hands to escort the women and issues a no fraternization policy . When one of them tries to rape one of them , he shoots him out of hand . It's the unsettled frontier and as wagonmaster he's the law on that train as much as a captain on a ship at sea . Of course the hands mutiny and strand Taylor , McIntire , cook Henry Nakamura and the women . This was a perfect western film for the post Rosie the Riveter generation . No reason at all why women couldn't deal with the rigors of a wagon train . Of course it helped to have the formidable Hope Emerson along . Of course men and women will be men and women and Taylor breaks his own no fraternization policy with Denise Darcel . Of course this is away from the train when Darcel runs off . William Wellman delivers us a no frills unsentimental western with gritty performances by Robert Taylor and the rest of the cast . In a bow to his colleague John Ford , Wellman does have a courtship dance at the settlement . I liked the use of the fiddle music playing Believe Me With All Those Endearing Young Charms and Drink to Me Only With Thine Eyes . Ford couldn't have staged it better . Henry Nakamura had made a big hit in MGM's Go For Broke about the Nisei division in Italy . He was a funny little guy , I'm not sure he was even five feet tall . I loved the scene when he and Taylor find a stash of buried liquor and proceed on a toot . This was his last film though , roles for oriental players were hard to come by . I wonder whatever happened to him . If you like traditional cowboy films , this one ain't for you , but given the constraints of 19th century society for the role of woman Westward the Women is quite a revelation .
Damon and Pythias	Showdown is another version of the two buddies who take different turns in the road of life . It borrows elements from George Marshall's supremely enjoyable Texas which starred two very young players named Glenn Ford and Bill Holden . The buddies here are Dean Martin and Rock Hudson . They're a little older than Bill and Glenn were . Rock Hudson is now a solid respectable citizen ranch owner , married to Susan Clark , and who also happens to be the sheriff . Dino cleared out from the ranch they had and has been gone for two years so he doesn't know that Hudson is the new sheriff . Maybe he wouldn't have decided to rob that train with some very serious outlaw types . Unfortunately Dino was recognized and Hudson has to bring him in . This turned out to be the last western film for both Dean Martin and Rock Hudson . Martin , starting with Rio Bravo in 1959 , did a whole string of westerns of varying quality . But making them is hard work , a fact Dean discovered one day out in the desert heat making these films . The rest of his movies were done in modern dress . Also for some reason two of the most agreeable stars to work with as attested to by numerous co-stars of both did not get along during the making of Showdown . Yet this Damon and Pythias story is still good entertainment and nothing either Rock or Dean had any reason to be ashamed of .
What Beautiful Poetry They Made	The Barretts of Wimpole Street was the most successful play written by Rudolph Besier and ran almost an entire year on Broadway in 1931 . It starred Katherine Cornell as Elizabeth Barrett and featured Brian Aherne as Robert Browning and Charles Waldron as Edward Moulton Barrett . Though Norma Shearer gives one of her best performances as Elizabeth Barrett it might have been nice to see Kit Cornell do this . But as we well know , she like the Lunts disdained film for the legitimate stage . Elizabeth Barrett was indeed a woman of poor health though it surely did not impair her literary output . In 1845 Robert Browning after corresponding with her for some time did on impulse come to meet her and eventually they did run off to Italy and marry . Much to the considerable objection of her father . Whether Edward Moulton Barrett was as tyrannical and lascivious as Charles Laughton portrays him is open to debate and interpretation . Laughton plays him in much the same way he played Inspector Javert a year later in Les Miserables . Firm and unbending and inhuman with only a book of rules to guide his conduct . It may have been the author's dramatic license , but it surely does explain his opposition . On the other hand , he might have thought Robert Browning a deadbeat who couldn't make a living at the poetry gig . But the former makes a more interesting story . Fredric March is fine as the dashing literate Victorian gentleman that was Robert Browning . In the rest of the cast I did particularly like Marie Clayton as Laughton's dizzy niece with a lisp who Elizabeth for all her literary accomplishments envies . The Barretts of Wimpole Street is one classic piece of cinema from MGM during the height of their Tiffany period .
" I'm Somebody's Father and Somebody's Grandfather "	Very few players have had the wisdom of Paul Newman in choosing film properties that have allowed him to grow old gracefully on the screen and never lose the public's favor . In Nobody's Fool , Newman emerges as a blue collar every man from a depressed area who realizes that he's made a whole lot of wrong choices in his life . That fact comes home to him when his son and his family come home to Bath , New York for Thanksgiving with his estranged wife . Right afterwards the wife splits and takes one of their two sons with her , leaving Dylan Walsh with his other son who move in with Newman . Walsh is an unemployed teacher who's finding jobs real scarce and he joins Newman doing contracting work . Of course they bond , but not without a few bumps on the road . Very few films have ever been made about modern upstate New York State of which Bath is a sadly typical example . There's been a depressed economy here for years . You hear a lot of talk in Nobody's Fool about the men wishing some company would relocate there and jobs come back to the town . Both political parties have had a field day blaming the other for the state of things , but no solutions are at hand . Bath is the county seat of Steuben County , located near the Finger Lakes . I'm sure Newman's characterization rang true with a lot of seniors who regret a lot of choices made in misspent youth . Not many get the chance Newman does to make amends somewhat . Look for nice performances by Jessica Tandy as Newman's landlady , her stuffy banker son Josef Sommer , Bruce Willis and Melanie Griffith as a contractor Newman works for and his wife Newman has a thing for and Philip Seymour Hoffman as an uptight small town police officer . Nobody's Fool is a nice film about the pitfalls and loneliness that can accompany growing old . It's a universal theme except for those who depart this mortal coil early enough to avoid the pitfalls .
An Adopted Son of Israel	Sword in the Desert was a quickly made feature film trying to cash in on the headlines concerning the rebirth of the State of Israel . The hopes and dreams of millions of Jews around the world who for two generations sent in sometimes pittance contributions to the Jewish Committee who started BUYING land in Palestine from the Ottoman Empire in the hopes of carving out a homeland for displaced people finally was realized a year earlier . The origins of Israel are always obscured by Arab propaganda about Zionist Imperialism . The nucleus of Israel is from land BOUGHT and then formalized by United Nations partition . When six Arab nations disagreed and attack Israel beat them back and acquired more than what she was originally intended for . That's also how they later got the whole of Jerusalem , when three nations attacked Israel again in 1967 in the Six Day War . Dana Andrews plays a captain of a tramp freighter who's making a nice living smuggling Jewish refugees into Palestine . He's strictly a cash and carry operator , but one time he gets himself caught up with his cargo when the British find him with same . He gets rescued by the Hagannah along with the rest of the refugees . After living with the Hagannah and seeing what they're up against , he becomes a committed Zionist himself . Of course the Zionist cause was definitely helped by having the beautiful and shapely Marta Toren working on his conversion . To Zionism , not to Judaism . The part of Kurta the charismatic Hagannah leader was the one that gave Jeff Chandler his first real notice . Chandler , who's real name was Ira Grossel was himself Jewish and one who felt his roots very deeply . Later on he made a well publicized trip to Israel in the late Fifties and expressed a wish to be buried there . When he died in 1961 his wishes were not carried out by his daughters and his ex-wife . Nevertheless , Chandler always treasured this film because of what it meant to him both professionally and personally . Stephen McNally has a substantial role as Hagannah fighter David Vogel and Irish actor Liam Redmond plays a former IRA man who joins up with the Jews because the British are tilting their neutrality way over to the Arabs . A lot of former IRA men did join up with the nascent Israeli cause and died for the creation of the Jewish state . Ironic that later on another generation of the IRA sided with the Arabs . Sword in the Desert was quickly put together and its hurried preparation does show . Still it's a good , but hardly a definitive story about Israeli independence . For that we would have to wait for Exodus and Cast a Giant Shadow .
A Taxpayer and a Good Republican	And that was Brian Keith's reason as to why he expected to get good service from the U . S . Cavalry . Ironically enough in post Civil War America that's about all it took . Poor Burt Lancaster in one of his few ventures into comedy , as commander of a frontier army post , he's expected to provide good order between the conflicting demands of drunken townsman , Republican businessmen , temperance women , and a tribe of Indians looking to get their hands on white man's firewater . Lancaster overacts outrageously , sort of a Sergeant Warden now an officer and hating every minute of it . Comedy is a little strange for the intense Mr . Lancaster . He's good , but I think Robert Mitchum would have been a natural fit for the lead . Lee Remick is leader of the temperance workers and in our time they can certainly be made an object of fun . Their efforts led to Prohibition ultimately which produced far more evils than demon rum . But it should never be forgotten that with the second class position of women in the 19th century as homemakers and little more else , keeping the male breadwinner sober and working was not a humorous thing . The roots of the temperance movement are very real . But this is a comedy and Lee Remick as a liberated woman of her time is expanding a bit on the part she played in Wheeler Dealers . Lots of similarity between this role as Cora Massingale and her part in Wheeler Dealers as Molly Thatcher , a pioneer woman stockbroker . The rest of the cast is fine , I would single out Brian Keith as the choleric taxpayer and good Republican and Donald Pleasance the psychic and alcoholic scout . John Sturges made some of the best action films of the 50s and 60s and this is certainly a good one . Also Elmer Bernstein's score is a winner .
Baseball's Iron Horse	The only reason I don't give this film a perfect 10 is that I think Gary Cooper was a bit too old to be playing Lou Gehrig as a youth . Cooper was 41 when Pride of the Yankees was made . He was two years older than Lou Gehrig actually was . While not terribly convincing as a college age Gehrig at Columbia University , the part of Gehrig grew into Cooper as Gehrig aged cinematically . And of course his recreation of Lou Gehrig's farewell to baseball got him an Oscar nomination . Henry Louis Gehrig , child of German immigrants who grew up in the Yorkville section of Manhattan , was arguably the greatest first baseman baseball has ever known . He certainly has very few competitors for the honor . His famous record of 2130 consecutive games was bettered about a decade ago by Cal Ripken , but he still holds the major league record for lifetime grandslam homeruns , 23 and the American League RBI record for a single season , 184 . He is one of a select group of ballplayers to have won the Triple Crown , he did that in 1934 . His lifetime batting average of . 340 is only topped by a handful . He was as writer Frank Graham put it , baseball's " quiet hero . " Until he was forced from baseball by the disease he gave his name to Gehrig played second fiddle to the flamboyant Babe Ruth and then to a graceful rookie named Joe DiMaggio . The facts of Gehrig's life are somewhat jumbled in this film for dramatic coherency , but the essence of his character is brought out in the script by Paul Gallico . In fact Gallico wrote himself into the film as sportswriter Sam Blake as played by Walter Brennan . Gary Cooper and Lou Gehrig and Teresa Wright as Eleanor Twitchell Gehrig both received Oscar nominations for their portrayals . It should also not be forgotten that Lou Gehrig was a German American and I believe one of the reasons the film was made was that at that time we were fighting Germany . The German American Bund had its following and very much so in Lou Gehrig's Yorkville neighborhood . German Americans certainly had other and better role models than the Bund . I remember as a lad going to Yankee oldtimers games and there was always a moment of reverential silence when the Yankee widows , Claire Hodgson Ruth and Eleanor Twitchell Gehrig were always introduced . Both survived their husbands by many years . In fact when Teresa Wright died this past year when the roll call of former Yankees who had passed on her name was read out among all the ballplayers . It was a fitting tribute to a great actress and a woman who didn't know a thing about baseball before she did this film , but became a devoted fan afterwards . I guess that was her private tribute to Lou Gehrig . There is still no cure for amytrophic lateral sclerosis or now known as Lou Gehrig's Disease . A lot of other noted persons have passed on from it , Jacob Javits , David Niven , Ezzard Charles , Dennis Day . Still we can hope for a dedicated and inspired scientist to find a cure . Until then we have this inspirational movie and Lou Gehrig's inspired and remembered life .
A Great Detective , A Lousy Cop , And Some Kind Of Man	That's a great epitaph Marlene Dietrich and Mort Mills put together for Orson Welles's character police captain Hank Quinlan . In a sense , since Welles directed himself in Touch of Evil he both created the character and the circumstances that bring him down . Two stories intersect in Touch of Evil . The first involves a particularly grisly murder in a Texas / Mexican border town of a man named Rudy Linnaker . The weapon was a car bomb , that went off just as Linnkaer and some chippie he was seeing crossed the border . Driving in the car just behind the late Mr . Linnaker was Charlton Heston as Mexican police detective Mike Vargas and his wife Janet Leigh . Heston is returning to Mexico City where in a few days he's taking the witness stand in the trial of a local drug kingpin . The kingpin's brother is Akim Tamiroff who's the local crime lord in that border town . Heston's case against Tamiroff's brother and Welles's investigation into the car bombing are completely unrelated , but do to some cleverly worked out plot machinations they get intertwined together . Charlton Heston has been quoted many times in saying that Orson Welles was the greatest director he ever worked for . He also rather modestly has stated that he did not give Welles his best screen performance . My own thought on it is that he really is not a terribly convincing latino . Maybe someone with Robert Mitchum's gift for dialect or a latino actor like Gilbert Roland might have been better . Still it's an earnest effort and Heston has nothing to be ashamed of . In fact Heston says and I agree that the story is really about Welles and his destruction . Welles has great instinct as a detective , but he's not really all that scrupulous about due process . That's what has Heston's back up and it forces Welles into an unthinkable alliance with Tamiroff . Janet Leigh gives us a sneak preview of what was in store for moviegoers in Psycho when she's trapped in that motel room with those punks that Tamiroff has sicced on her . One of the punks in fact was Mercedes McCambridge doing a little gender bending generations before Boys Don't Cry . At the motel Dennis Weaver has a marvelous bit part as the useless and feckless ' night man . ' Welles put a lot of his favorites in small roles here . Ray Collins took time away from Perry Mason on television to play the District Attorney . Joseph Cotten has a small bit as a medical examiner , Harry Shannon was the state's attorney , it was a regular Citizen Kane reunion . Marlene Dietrich who was Welles's foil and partner in his magic act plays the owner of a border town dive and his mistress who loves him though she recognizes all his faults . This was a banner year for Dietrich because she also did her highly acclaimed role in Witness for the Prosecution . One part though that should have been up for an Academy Award was Joseph Calleia who was Welles's devoted subordinate who in the end ironically helps to bring him down . It's a great piece of acting and Charlton Heston said that Joseph Calleia never did anything better in his entire cinema career . I wouldn't argue the point . Now that the ' director's cut ' is available we can now see Touch of Evil and realize what Welles's vision was for this film . Indifferently received when first out , it's grown to become a classic and probably one of the three or four films Welles the director gets the most acclaim for . And now it's probably better than when first seen by the public .
A Primer On Sino-American Relations	If The Sand Pebbles had been filmed ten years earlier it might have been called From Here to Eternity Goes to Sea . Like the James Jones novel it's protagonist is a loner type who finds a sense of purpose and order in the military . As Robert E . Lee Pruitt loved bugling and boxing , Jake Holman loves his engines . He's real happy to be on board the naval gunboat San Pablo , nicknamed Sand Pebbles , because he is the engineering staff and he takes real pride in making the naval vessel perform . Also kind of like Eugene O'Neill's Yank in The Hairy Ape . But Steve McQueen as Jake Holman , probably THE rebel character he ever played in film , finds his life getting increasingly complex by America's mission in China between the two World Wars . In 1911 China overthrew the Manchu dynasty which in its weakened state over the last century had sold off parcels of real estate outrightly controlled by European powers and later by Japan as well . The United States controlled no territory outright as other powers did , but we did insist on extraterritoriality involving our citizens doing business there . What that meant was that our citizens were not subject to Chinese laws , civil or criminal , matters involving them went to American courts . Other powers had those same treaties . That was resented , westerners were resented , Japanese were resented most of all because they were fellow Asians doing it to the Chinese . But in this story we are concerned with Americans , particularly our missionaries who viewed China as one vast mission field for Christianity . Missionaries like all people come in different shapes , sizes and intelligence . Some of them really did contribute positively to China . But when westerners began being resented , missionaries were included with the rest . Two such would be Larry Gates and Candice Bergen . Candice plays a sincere young lady who heard a church talk and filled with romantic religious notions about saving the heathen in China volunteered to go there . She and McQueen bond in the same way that Monty Clift and Donna Reed do in From Here to Eternity . But Gates is a fascinating character . He's a very knowledgeable man , quite versed on the current political situation in China . Yet he's absolutely blind to the fact that he's in grave danger . It's a peculiar thing about some liberal types , they have great insight into the terrible wrongs done in the past . But at a certain point when guns start firing , buildings start toppling , we can't worry about political , economic , and social abuses of the past . You have to defend yourself and as vigorously as possible . Still it's McQueen's film . As I said he's a rebel hero , but the military doesn't exactly favor individualism . His captain , Richard Crenna , is a by the book sailor who also doesn't understand the forces of resentment around him , but will not see his ship disgraced in any way . He and McQueen don't hit it off from the start . There's a touching side story involving Richard Attenborough and a Chinese woman , Marryat Andriane who do the unthinkable and get married . Oriental women are for shacking up with , but not to be brides . They find no acceptance in either society and meet a Sayonara like end . McQueen's performance was one of eight Oscar nominations The Sand Pebbles got including Best Picture , Best Director for Robert Wise , Best Supporting Actor for Make as the coolie who McQueen bonds with and who also finds no acceptance in either society . Unfortunately this was McQueen's only Oscar nomination and The Sand Pebbles had the misfortune to be up against A Man for All Seasons . In fact The Sand Pebbles took home nary a statue . Yet viewed today , The Sand Pebbles is a primer for one who might want a visual as to Sino-American relations in the last century . And a great performance by Steve McQueen for his legion of fans .
Master of the Cultured Ad-lib	Frank Capra in his autobiography called Bing Crosby , " the master of the cultured ad-lib . " A lot of time Crosby would drop several ad-libs into a script and Capra kept them in . According to Capra they were betterthan what the screenwriter had written . Of course partnering with Bob Hope in several films and thousands of radio , television , and live shows Bing had to be quick on the uptake . Capra wanted to do another of his populist films like Mr . Deeds etc . , in the three picture deal he signed with Paramount . But after doing Riding High and doing it well with Bing Crosby , he wanted to do one of his type film . The Paramount brass said no , but since he was unhappy at Paramount they agreed to drop their last picture commitment on his contract for one more Crosby film . Just make a good one . Capra was as good as his word . This film is entertainment plus and a lot of that has to do with the chemistry between Bing and Jane Wyman . Most of Crosby's leading ladies were nice women who just melted with the Crosby charm . Not so here . Ms . Wyman gives as good with the wisecracks as Crosby does and is no pushover . What she is here is a fianc√© who's grown tired of waiting for her man who's out gallivanting all over the world as per his job as correspondent . When he finally does come back he has two French orphans in tow . But Jane's decided to marry millionaire Franchot Tone . Bing has to get her back or those kids will be deported . That's where the fun starts . By now Paramount was giving Crosby vehicles some respectable budgets and that included letting Frank Capra hire a lot of his favorite supporting players . Those folks make a Capra film an enjoyable experience . Franchot Tone does nicely as millionaire rival and critics were astounded at Alexis Smith who turned out to have a real flair for comedy . Funny parts she wasn't getting at Warner Brothers . She plays a " kissing " cousin of Franchot Tone and figures prominently in Bing's machinations . They were also astounded at Jane Wyman who nobody realized could sing . Why they were is beyond me since she did start in musical choruses . The song In the Cool Cool Cool of the Evening by Hoagy Carmichael and Johnny Mercer won an Oscar for best song and became one of Bing's million selling records , dueted with Jane Wyman on screen and on vinyl . The rest of the score is by Jay Livingston and Ray Evans who were under contract to Paramount and for some reason or other never wrote another Crosby film score . Probably because Paramount didn't assign them because many years later they scored and arranged a whole album of duets with Bing and Rosemary Clooney called That Traveling Two Beat Time . And Bing did pretty good with a song written for his friend Bob Hope by them called Silver Bells . One of the Livingston-Evans songs was a patented philosophical number called Your Own Little House . A nice song on record , on screen it's a great impromptu style number that so many of Crosby's seemed to be . Sung with a group of kids who are French war orphans , Bing does some gentle kidding of fellow entertainers Jimmy Durante and Maurice Chevalier . This is one of Bing's best and great entertainment .
The Summit	One of the amazing things about Heat is that during an almost three hour running time of the film , your interest in what happens in the summit teaming of Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro never flags for a second . Part of the reason is because these guys are at the top of their profession and brought their A game to the parts . The roles they have are not as good as Jake LaMotta , Jimmy Conway , or Max Cady for DeNiro or Frank Serpico , Michael Corleone , or Bobby Deefield for Pacino . But Neil McCauley master criminal for DeNiro and Jake Hanna dogged detective for Pacino does show these guys at their best . You can best describe Heat as a long running version of Law and Order Criminal Intent with a big budget . Like that show the action shifts back from the cops to the criminals and smoothly for director / writer Michael Mann . We see both of these guys as rather similar to each other . DeNiro prides himself on the fact that he says he can drop any relationship if it interferes with work . And Pacino is on his third marriage and his mistress is the job . He's been a failure twice as a husband and about to go thrice in the romance department . Mann gave Pacino and DeNiro a really outstanding cast for support in Heat . People like Val Kilmer are in DeNiro's gang , Jon Voight is the Sam Jaffe like mastermind of the operation . Pacino on his team has Mykel T . Williamson from Forrest Gump and Ted Levine best known as Captain Stottlemyre on Monk . This action film also does not stint on woman's roles . Diane Venora is fine as Pacino's estranged wife . Amy Breneman is also good as DeNiro's woman who watches her man helplessly trapped by his own criminal rules go to his destruction . Best in the film on the distaff side is Ashley Judd as Val Kilmer's loyal wife who has one great choice given her by Williamson , betray her husband or lose their kid . See how she handles it . Although the scene was shoehorned into the plot and would never happen in real life , Pacino and DeNiro do meet and have a brief scene together over a cup of coffee in a diner . They compare notes so to speak and take the measure of the other guy . Since these two guys are the most acclaimed actors of their generation , the scene artificial though it is takes on a whole different dimension . It's like when writers give Queen Elizabeth and Mary Queen of Scots a climatic meeting scene even though in real life it never happened . But like in Heat , it should have happened .
" About To Take That Ride Again "	Cabin In The Sky marked Vincente Minnelli's feature film debut as a director and he certainly started on a grand scale . Louis B . Mayer was purportedly reluctant to do black cast feature film with an A Budget , but Minnelli and Arthur Freed's faith in Minnelli paid off big time . Cabin In The Sky , musical fantasy , with score by John LaTouche and Vernon Duke ran for 156 performances in the 1940-1941 Broadway season . The only two members of the cast who made it to the screen version was lead Ethel Waters and Rex Ingram as Lucifer , Jr . Unless of course you count the Hall Johnson Choir . It would have never been made if MGM could not get Ethel Waters to repeat her role as the wise and faithful Petunia Johnson praying ever so that her husband Little Joe Johnson gets saved from his evil ways of drinking and gambling and carousing with that no good Georgia Brown on whom no gal made has got a shade . Come to think of it , that song should have been interpolated in the score , MGM should have paid any price for it . MGM got their work out of Ethel though . She appeared in Cairo with Jeanette MacDonald and Robert Young and the contrasting styles of MacDonald and Waters is something to see in that film . On Broadway Little Joe's part was played by someone who would make a big splash in Hollywood this same year of 1943 . Because Dooley Wilson was playing piano at Rick's place in Casablanca , I guess he missed repeating his role . Stepping in for Wilson was America's most well known butler , Eddie ' Rochester ' Anderson who did the impossible , get rich working for Jack Benny . Sweet Georgia Brown was played by Lena Horne , the devil had no better temptress ever on screen , not even Gwen Verdon in Damn Yankees . She does a mean version of Honey In The Honeycomb . The plot's a simple one . Petunia brings her husband Little Joe to church for the hundred and umpteenth time to get himself saved , but he slips away for a crap game and gets himself shot in the process . He's about to enter the devil's domain , but Petunia's prayers get him a six month stay of his sentence to see if he can mend his ways . After that both heavenly and hellish forces work overtime to have claim to his soul . LaTouche and Duke gave Ethel Waters two of her best known numbers to sing , the title song and Taking A Chance On Love . Cabin In The Sky has a unique distinction of being one of the few Broadway musicals that came to the screen . Harold Arlen and E . Y . Harburg wrote some new material including a song for Eddie Anderson Life's Full of Consequences and another song uniquely identified with Ethel Waters , Happiness Is Just A Thing Called Joe . Louis Armstrong is in Cabin In The Sky as Lucifer's Trumpeter and while we get a couple of licks from Satchmo , I do so wish that someone at MGM would have given him a number for himself . He doesn't standout as he usually does because of that . Still Cabin In The Sky is a delightful film , a real treat with some of the best talent in the human race in it .
Our Destiny Is In Our Own Hands	Released in 1959 , the apocalypse of On the Beach allegedly took place in 1964 . We missed it , but it sure doesn't mean it still can't happen . Maybe now more than ever . But probably not in the way it happens here . That's one of the awful things about On the Beach , they don't know what happened . Scientists among the survivors in Australia speculate , but they don't really know . Interesting however that their speculations led to the future film scenarios in Failsafe and Doctor Strangelove . But as Ava Gardner said , she didn't do anything so why is she and all the rest still left south of the equator doomed . Nuclear war has occurred and the result was total annihilation of life in the Northern Hemisphere . The nuclear powered submarine U . S . S . Sawfish was submerged and sailed south until land with people was found in Australia . Still people like Gregory Peck can't get it into their heads that everything they knew and loved is gone . Still though he finds time for a romantic interlude with Ava Gardner as the Australians and those who made it to their shore size up the situation and it ain't good and no options for hope . Nevil Shute's apocalyptic novel was filmed in Australia and it leaves a good ring of authenticity . Anthony Perkins gives an earnest portrayal of the young officer in the Royal Australian Navy though he does slip in and out of the Aussie accent . Besides the message of On the Beach the main publicity about the film concerned Fred Astaire in his first straight dramatic part . He got rave reviews from astonished critics and deservedly so , playing a nuclear scientist who know amuses himself by indulging in a secret fantasy to become an auto racer . This film was hated , still hated by right wing critics everywhere because of its total pessimism . The religious right particularly doesn't like this film because the apocalypse arrives and there's no divine intervention , even just to save God's Elect whomever they might be . It's just the end of life and the promise that future visitors to the planet might piece together the story of what happened as does the crew of the Starship Enterprise finding a devastated world or two on their mission to seek out life . Yes , it could happen to us . I think that what Stanley Kramer was trying to tell us is that whatever created this universe left it in the hands of those who inhabit it to do what they could with it or any corner thereof . It's our responsibility to find a way to live together and respect each other and our differences or annihilate ourselves . It's not easy , but it's that simple . Maybe we'll learn that lesson and On the Beach is a good teacher .
Rita was never lovelier	It would have been nice had this not been World War II and we could actually have done this film in Buenos Aires . As it is , except for a few newsreel shots at the beginning of the film , this might as well have taken place in San Diego . Having said that this tinsel of a story is put over by the charm and beauty of its two leads , Fred Astaire and Rita Hayworth . Not to mention a good supporting cast led by Adolphe Menjou who is busy poaching on the preserve of Hollywood cranky fathers usually inhabited by folks like Eugene Palette and George Barbier . Menjou's got some strange ideas . He wants to see his daughters get married , but in descending order . Rita is number two daughter and she's holding things up for three and four . Of course numbers three and four have fianc√©s panting at the bit . Through the usual comedy of errors that are prevalent in Fred Astaire movies , Menjou's conceived a dislike for Fred and Rita's seeing something in him . How will it all work out ? Astaire movies always have flimsy or silly plot lines , but they have him and an attractive female partner dancing to some of the best music ever written for the screen . And when it's Jerome Kern's music , it don't get much better than that . And the dancing partners don't get more talented than Rita Hayworth . She is positively radiant in this film . And she and Fred dance divinely to one of my favorite Jerome Kern ballads , I'm Old Fashioned . Reason enough to see this film .
Doublecrossing A Killer , When he's his own Police	The film that launched Alan Ladd's career , This Gun For Hire is a very short film like the earlier Public Enemy which gave James Cagney his stardom . This would be the normal length of a B film , but it definitely gets all it wants to say in its brief running time . Essentially we have three stories where all the principal players get brought together in the end . The first involves Robert Preston investigating a reported payroll robbery of the firm that Tully Marshall is the president of . Note that I said ' reported robbery . ' The second involves his girl friend , entertainer Veronica Lake being recruited by no one less than a United States Senator to get the goods on one of Marshall's top aides , Laird Cregar who they think is doing some fifth column work at the behest of Marshall . Finally we have contract killer Alan Ladd who's hired by Cregar to bump off Frank Ferguson who is blackmailing Marshall as to his treasonous activities . Preston , Ladd , and Lake don't know they are all on the same case , but by the end of the film they do . Alan Ladd became Paramount's answer to Humphrey Bogart as a star of action / adventure films and noir films . This Gun for Hire launched his career . He was enormously popular through the Forties , Paramount's biggest star after Crosby and Hope . He played cynical tough guys in modern films , but then branched into westerns where for the most part he was the gallant hero . In fact the ultimate gallant white knight hero in Shane . His part as Raven is a difficult one , yet he pulls it off . He's a cold blooded contract killer , one of the earliest ever portrayed as a film protagonist . Yet he's human and you see flashes of it , his concern for cats . As a cat lover , I can sure identify with that . Raven is also one of the earliest characters in cinema who talks about child abuse making him what he is . Groundbreaking when you think about it . Next to Ladd , the biggest kudos have to go to Laird Cregar , borrowed from 20th Century Fox to play Willard Gates . Gates is a top company executive with Marshall's firm which is a defense contractor which is why the Senate is interested in him . He's basically a jerk who thinks he's so clever . Veronica Lake gets to him real easy because of his weakness for the nightclub scene . And he really doesn't take the full measure of Raven , even though the audience is very aware of how deadly he is . When you think about it what Cregar and Marshall do is unbelievably stupid . They hire Ladd to kill Ferguson and then pay him with hot money , from the alleged robbery . Why would you do that ? Chances are in the rackets they're involved in , they might have need of his services in the future . Not a guy to get mad at you . In fact their double cross is what sets the whole film plot in motion . Moral is never double cross a guy who says and means that " I'm my own police . " This Gun for Hire was Director Frank Tuttle's finest film . He was a contract director for Paramount who did a whole bunch of films with their various stars in the Thirties and Forties . When he hadn't worked in a while , Alan Ladd got him a job directing him in Hell On Frisco Bay while he was at Warner Brothers and Tuttle also directed A Cry In the Night which Ladd produced . Ladd remembered and was grateful to Tuttle for helping break through into top star ranks . Ladd was like John Wayne that way , ever ready to help a colleague down on his luck . Veronica Lake is recruited by a U . S . Senator with a fictitious name , but in fact there was a committee looking into all kinds of things like this in the Senate in regard to the conduct of the war . It was headed by a Senator from Missouri named Harry Truman who went on to higher office . I wonder if Truman liked This Gun for Hire ? Veronica Lake got a big boost in her career . She and Ladd became a classic screen team as a result of this film . This film is one great cinematic classic , so important to so many careers and still keeps you on the edge of your seat today .
Never Outfox The Fox	After The Fox finds Peter Sellers and his then bride Britt Eklund working in Italy for director Vittorio DeSica . In it Sellers plays a criminal who if he's not quite a master at the crime trade , at least he's not a bumbler like Inspector Clousseau . The laughs Sellers gets in After The Fox come at the expense of others . A robbery of gold bullion has occurred in Egypt and Interpol is on the case . As we learned in The Lavender Hill Mob , gold bullion is not that easy to transport . Taking on the job of getting it into Europe after he's broken out of jail once again is Peter Sellers . How to do it ? Right out in the open during the course of shooting a movie about a heist . Sellers pretends to be a director and gets the a whole coastal village in on his scheme . After all , who doesn't want to be in the movies ? Part of Sellers plan is to convince over the hill American movie actor Victor Mature to star in his film . After The Fox was Mature's first film in five years , at this point in his life he worked when he felt like it . Mature was one of the least vain of all film stars , how many will say that he's no actor and have 63 pictures to prove it . He looked like he was having a ball satirizing himself and several of his colleagues still pretending they're leading men . Britt Eklund is Seller's girl friend and Akim Tamiroff is the guy who pulled off the gold heist . Maria Gracia Buccella has an unforgettable part as Tamiroff's sister and ' the bikini trap ' . This woman in a bikini makes Sophia Loren look flat-chested . Martin Balsam also has a good role as Mature's exasperated agent . To see what happens if the budding film director can really smuggle some gold into Italy you have to see After The Fox . It's one of Peter Sellers best films and you've got to love Victor Mature for what he does with his own image here .
Hero Worship Turns Sour	Though Jesse James through the newspaper accounts of his exploits and through the dime novels of the day was already a legend , his immortality was sealed on April 3 , 1882 by the manner of his death . The lengthy title of the film tells all or at least the official version of the story . But was that accepted version the real story ? For the first time the Ford brothers , Robert and Charley , get their due . As played by Casey Affleck , Robert Ford was a most complex character indeed . Ford is shown for what he was , a moonstruck kid who was brought up on those dime novels and idolized the legendary bandit . The fact that Charley was already riding with the James gang got him into the group . After the last job the James gang pulled and the only Ford was ever in on , the Fords kind of attached themselves to Jesse James . Of course the idol is no hero . Brad Pitt plays a most unheroic Jesse . Hints of Pitt's interpretation of Jesse's character are found in the classic portrayal of Jesse James by Tyrone Power . Remember when the laconic Henry Fonda as Frank James dresses Jesse down , tells him he's getting mean , meaner every day even with some of his own gang members ? Power was showing signs of it , but we see Pitt as Jesse do some really brutal and cruel things . At the same time he's a loving husband to Mary Louise Parker and doting father to his two children . As good as Pitt is I think the acting honors go to Casey Affleck . His gradual disillusion with his idol is really something to see on the screen . He becomes really scared of Pitt for reasons I won't reveal , but were definitely sufficient to want him to get Pitt . We also get to see the Fords sorry aftermath . Things did not go so well for them . Bob Ford did not quite get the acclaim he would have liked as Jesse James became bigger after death than in life . Frank James as played briefly in the beginning is an odd peripheral character in this film . The James brothers did separate some months before Jesse's death . Frank is played by Sam Shepard who has an encounter with young Bob Ford at the beginning of the film and announces to one and all , the kid creeps him out . But Jesse likes having the kid follow him around like a puppy dog to his ultimate regret . The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is a very good western and we sure don't see too many of them in these times . It's shot in an unusual color , almost like one of those sepia-tone films that were in vogue for a brief spell . The location shooting was done in western Canada and looks a whole lot more like Missouri then than Missouri does now .
Yugoslavia Tears Itself Apart	I saw this film tonight at the Image Out Film Festival in Rochester and what I saw is a powerful story about both love and hate reaching across ethnic and religious boundaries . The love is what Mario Drmec and Tarik Filipovic have for each other . Same sex couples have it bad enough there , but in this case Mario is a Moslem from Bosnia and Tarik is a Serb . The story is told to us in flashback by Mario being interviewed by a French journalist played by Jeanne Moreau . As Yugoslavia breaks apart the various ethnic groups resume all their ancient hatreds and start killing each other with vehemence as we all read in the Nineties . Mario in order to pass into the Christian Serbian area goes into drag . It seems as though the Christians check out the privates of all the males and if they're circumcised as Moslems have to do as well as Jews they're summarily shot . The ruse works , but the lovers have to continue the masquerade when they get to Tarik's village . Or at least until a helpful friend can obtain the necessary documents to go west to the other side of the Rhine in Europe . Of course when someone does discover the ruse there are unforeseen consequences . Yugoslavia itself was a creation of western European fatuity . Serbia was on the Allied side of World War I and they got a kind of hegemony over a whole lot of territory formerly belonging to both the Hapsburg and Ottoman Empires . At Versailles the Serb king was made monarch over the whole polyglot nation and after World War II , a very charismatic leader named Josip Broz Tito led an independent Marxist / Socialist government . When Marshal Tito died , the country itself died . Held together by an extraordinary man the one thing Tito did not do was solve any ancient hatreds . What happens here happened all over what was Yugoslavia , only this story has gay angle to it . Love , even same sex love can bridge all kinds of boundaries if we're open to it . The friend who is helping the lovers urges them to go west to western Europe where they can live free and prosper . All they have there is ethnic hatred . One other very valuable lesson here is that the film does focus on the atrocities of the Serbs and the Bosnians . Remember this is now a decade where admittedly Moslems are doing some horrible things in many parts of the globe . I am glad that the villain here is not one religion , but a fanatical fundamentalist interpretation of any religion with which people can justify all kinds of barbarism . Ahmed Imamovic the director has received death threats from all sides in the former Yugoslavia for even creating a story involving gay people there . The man has risked his life for this powerful story , buy a ticket and don't miss it .
In Her Majesty's Service	I've found it fascinating over the past 20 years that with the advances made in special effects techniques , comic book heroes have had an explosion in popularity on the screen . The films , good , bad or indifferent seem to make money with a built in market . We seem to get a few of them every year with accompanying merchandise . One I liked very much was based on the idea of combining a whole bunch of literary characters from the 19th century into The League for Extraordinary Gentlemen . Some heroes , some villains , some troubled people all get together in the service of the British Empire to find out just who wants to brew a lot of trouble among the European Powers . It's quite a crew they've assembled , Allen Quatermaine , Mina Harker , Dorian Grey , Captain Nemo , The Invisible Man , Dr . Jekyll and his alter ego Mr . Hyde , and visiting from America Tom Sawyer . They're in for some high adventure , the kind kids eagerly used to read about in the books these people are found in . The League of Extraordinary Gentleman has a kind of infectious charm that I find irresistible . A lot of that has to do with Sean Connery as Allen Quartermaine , fresh from the continent of Africa , and leader of this band . As of today , this film has been the last screen appearance of the man some word argue is the biggest international star the movies have right now . I particularly like the scenes that Connery has with Shane West who plays Special Agent Tom Sawyer of the United States Secret Service . I'll bet you didn't know where Tom Sawyer would wind up when he grew up and left the Mississippi . Seems perfectly logical watching this film . Quartermaine lost a son and buried two wives and he bonds with young Sawyer . He even warns him against romancing Mina Harker , played by Peta Wilson whose vampiric proclivities might be a bit much for a young man to handle . I'm sure The League for Extraordinary Gentlemen got a lot of young viewers going to see it . If any of them get curious enough to read the books these characters are found in , than this film will have done a great service . By the way , the chief villain when he's unmasked is yet another villain found in a series of classic books from that time period and one of the recruited league in fact is a traitor . I won't say , you'll have to buy or rent the video / DVD .
It Could Still Be Running	I'm not quite sure why Murder She Wrote isn't still running . I'm willing to bet that Angela Lansbury could command any kind of deal she could have if she wanted to do more episodes of this wonderful series . Angela Lansbury is maybe one of the kindest and most unselfish of players ever to grace the big screen , the small screen and the legitimate theater . Let's not forget she's a star in all three mediums . What I like best about her is the fact that she used her star power to give lots of work to her fellow performers from the golden age of Hollywood's studio system who weren't as lucky with their careers as she . Just look at the cast list of any random selection of Murder , She Wrote episodes . For twelve years she got every weekend to show up the police in every corner of the globe that they had the wrong solution to a given murder . The amazing thing is that most of them simply went with the flow as far as her interference with their investigation . It was part of her charm for them and for us . About half the episodes took place in the little New England coastal town of Cabot Cove where William Windom as the town doctor and first sheriff Tom Bosley and then sheriff Ron Masak got assistance from Jessica Fletcher every time she was in town at her home . I liked the Cabot Cove shows best and I suspect most viewers did . Though that presents a problem in that Cabot Cove given the percentage of the population might just have the highest murder rate in the country . Good thing she WAS around . But even there she never embarrassed Bosley or Masak in solving the cases . Her best scenes are with William Windom , the crusty old town doctor , Seth Hazlitt . I suspect that back in their youth Jessic and Seth were an item and the way Lansbury and Windom are with each other , you can see the bonds are strong . The writers in Murder , She Wrote very wisely never made Dr . Hazlett any kind of buffoon the way Nigel Bruce was as Doctor Watson to Basil Rathbone's Sherlock Holmes . Windom played it absolutely straight and his medical knowledge occasionally helped Lansbury solve the case . I think it's a shame that William Windom never got an Emmy for playing Dr . Hazlitt . My hope is that somebody gets the bright idea to have a reunion episode and maybe finally marry Jessica Fletcher and Dr . Seth Hazlitt . It would be the highest rated show of a given season .
Put To The Test And Passes With Flying Colors	It took a loan out film to Columbia for Gene Kelly's home studio MGM to realize his creative talent and give him some control over what he did in his own films . Cover Girl also became Rita Hayworth's signature film for the GIs and their pinup fantasies during World War II . Kelly plays the owner of a small nightclub in Brooklyn where Rita is a featured dancer and Phil Silvers the comic . Of course Kelly does a bit of hoofing himself there . Hayworth comes to the attention of millionaire Otto Kruger when it turns out that Kruger had loved and lost Hayworth's grandmother . In some flashback sequences from the gaslight era , Hayworth also plays her own grandmother with Jess Barker playing the young Kruger . You might remember Jess Barker was the husband of that other legendary screen redhead , Susan Hayward . Broadway producer Lee Bowman also is attracted to Hayward , but he's not interested in nostalgia . He wants her for his Ziegfeld Follies revue and in fact the biggest number of Cover Girl is the title song of the film . It's nicely done in Follies style . Hayworth also gets to sing A Sure Thing in a gaslight era number and in the only song in the show not written by Jerome Kern and Ira Gershwin , Hayworth also does an old English music hall number Poor John . When I say sing , as everyone knows Rita mouths words . Singing here is done by Nan Wynn . The biggest hit of the show is Long Ago and Far Away which is introduced by Gene Kelly . It was one of the biggest hits of the World War II era and one of the biggest sellers Jerome Kern ever wrote . It happens in fact to be a favorite of an aunt of mine who with my uncle will be celebrating 60 years of marriage this September . Long Ago and Far Away was nominated for Best Song , but lost to Swinging on a Star . What really sets Cover Girl apart and what makes it a milestone film for Gene Kelly is the two numbers Put Me to the Test and the Alter Ego number . Harry Cohn decided to do what Louis B . Mayer had refused at MGM , to give Kelly creative control of his own material . Kelly later said the alter ego number was one of the hardest things he ever attempted in his career . In it he dances with a pale reflection of himself and the choreography is dazzling and intricate . In fact after one more loan out film , Christmas Holiday at Universal , Louis B . Mayer never loaned out Gene Kelly for the rest of the time he was at MGM . And he did get creative control from then on . With that dazzling technicolor cinematography and Rita's red hair and Gene Kelly's boundless creativity , Cover Girl was and is a classic and will forever be so .
A Child Is Listening , Maybe Your Own	The greatest thing about Sigourney Weaver and the rest of the cast members who played members of the Griffith family is that in making Prayers For Bobby they did not succumb to the temptation of making a caricature of their character . It's been done before , it would have been so easy , the religious right gives you so much material . But the Griffith family Harry Czerny , Sigourney Weaver and their children aren't bad people . All they have done is sit back quite comfortably on the assurance of their faith that GLBT people are not quite normal , they are afflicted with some deadly mind disease that God does not approve of . And there a lot of people who will go to their graves thinking that , though the amount shrinks as time goes on . You can have a lot of smug assumptions until the problem hits home with you . Which is what happens to the Griffith family when young Ryan Kelley as Bobby Griffith comes out to his brother who promptly rats him out to his mother . After that its the attempts to search for a cure or as writer Wayne Besen has so aptly put it , ' pray the gay away ' . I've known a lot of people who were survivors of such colossal ignorance as preached by the religious right . Here in my native Buffalo , I know one young man who moved here two years ago and he grew up in the Assemblies of God Church . It took him a long time to break free and realize his self worth , but his is a lot happier a story than what happens to Mary Griffith and her son . Another man whom I had a relationship with back in New York when I lived there was a survivor of electroshock treatment . It was thought that would cure him by his parents who were from the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia . It was this or kick him out of the house and disown him which is what eventually happened . I'm sure they thought they were doing the best for their kid . When I worked at Crime Victims Board I had a mugging case of a young kid in Central Park . But what had happened to him was that he had come out to his enlightened parents and they threw him out of the house . This was not a street smart kid , he lived on the upper east side of Manhattan and went to prep school . He was staying in Central Park that night and got mugged and I got the case from a shelter in New York . I know his plans were to go to a girl's house he knew where her parents were more accepting eventually . I never did find out if he made it . I can tell you first hand that the Griffith experience is far from an isolated one . Gay / Lesbian / BiSexual / Transgender youth are far more at risk for suicide than their straight peers . But what makes the Griffith story unique is how they and especially Mary Griffith took a mind numbing tragedy and turned it into a position of advocacy for those who too often don't get it . That is the challenge that Sigourney Weaver in her performance shows that Mary Griffith and her family met and overcame . Sigourney's final speech before her small town council advocating plans for a Gay Pride Day will move all of you . It might even cause some on the religious right to question their smug assumptions about us . That is my prayer for Bobby . And this film review is dedicated to all of the case examples I knew from my professional and personal life and to one other . A young lady from Warsaw , New York who had the courage to break from her fundamentalist family and seek love and acceptance in a wider more tolerant place on this globe . I wish I had her guts when I was a teen .
The Tramp Does His Bit	Considering all of the comedies with a military situation that have been done in history , someone had to be the first . One could make a case that in Shoulder Arms , Charlie Chaplin invented the genre . Hard to believe that back then this was a daring move . When you consider that some of the best films involving such people as Bob Hope , Abbott & Costello , Laurel & Hardy involved military service and made during war time , it's just something you accept and laugh at . In the First World War Chaplin along with fellow stars Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford went out on bond tours . He was a great supporter of the Allied cause , unusual for someone of his left wing views . It would seem only natural that the Tramp would be drafted and unfortunately would flummox around and wreak havoc on all . A lot of things you'd see in the service comedies of World War II got their start in Shoulder Arms . Chaplin had no more imitators because within a few weeks of the film's release , the war was over . But a comedy art form had been established by one of comedy's greatest geniuses .
" Like A Thief In The Night "	Although the film is a work of fiction , The Tall Target is based in part on an actual incident that involved an attempt to assassinate President - elect Abraham Lincoln on his way to Washington to assume the presidency in early 1861 . A planned stop in Baltimore was canceled and Lincoln was spirited into Washington in the wee small hours of the morning with no kind of fanfare or publicity , as he put it , ' like a thief in the night ' . Anthony Mann directed this 19th century noir type film starring Dick Powell as a New York police sergeant who gets wind of a plot to murder Lincoln in Baltimore . After he confides his suspicions to colleague Regis Toomey , Toomey winds up dead and Powell's more convinced than ever of the rightness of his belief . He boards the train that Lincoln is scheduled to board in Baltimore on to warn him , but Powell's got a lot of people on that train ready to do him in and he doesn't know who to trust . The Tall Target is very similar to Mann's other classic Winchester 73 in the tautness of the direction and script . There isn't one wasted frame of film in The Tall Target and the suspense is kept throughout , even though history tells us Lincoln dodged a bullet that day . Mann assembled a very strong supporting cast for Powell that includes Adolphe Menjou as a militia colonel called to the colors , Leif Erickson as a Bowery tough , Will Geer as an officious conductor , Marshall Thompson as a southern hothead and resigned West Point cadet and his sister Paula Raymond . Best performance in the film though is that of young Ruby Dee who plays a slave to Thompson and Raymond traveling with them . She proves to be the only real friend Powell has on the train . It's a quiet understated performance of dignity and strength . By the way in case any of you are wondering why she doesn't just run away and claim her freedom , a couple of things stops her . The Dred Scott decision for one which obliterated the Missouri Compromise of 1820 with the northern free and southerns slave states and the new Fugitive Slave Law from the 1850 Compromise . However Dee knows that freedom is coming her way and soon . The Tall Target is one excellent film , one of the best from Dick Powell when he decided to stop making musicals . Catch it absolutely .
Reconnecting With The World	The Pawnbroker is maybe the best of Sidney Lumet's New York based films . It tells the story of Sol Nazerman , former professor from Germany , Holocaust survivor , now making a living as a pawnbroker in Harlem . Rod Steiger got an Oscar nomination for Best Actor . If he had lost to Sir Laurence Olivier for Othello I might understand , but losing to Lee Marvin for Cat Ballou ? All three are performances on different planes of acting . This is one of those films like Cyrano De Bergerac which rise and fall on the ability of the person performing the title character . With a minimum of dialog and a performance mostly of anguished expressions , Rod Steiger conveys the story of a man who's really seen the worst of what life has to offer and expects very little from humanity . And in Harlem no one rises among the dregs of society that usually come peddling the last of their dreams to him . This film was done in 1964 and that was also the year of the Harlem riots , sparked by an NYPD officer killing a black teenager . My guess is that Sol Nazerman's pawn shop , white owned that it was never saw a scrap of damage . That's because one of the reasons he stays in business is because of a little money laundering on the side for Harlem racketeer Brock Peters . Unfortunately Steiger's assistant Jaime Sanchez sees a huge amount of cash being deposited in the safe after office hours . He's an ambitious young man and not really deciding which side of the fence to fall on . It's more his indecision that leads to tragedy later on . The highlight of the film for me is Steiger's equivalent of a ' hath a Jew not eyes ' speech when he explains to Sanchez just why the Jewish people have the ' mercantile heritage ' as he puts it . Too often it's forgotten that in all the places for thousands of years where Jews couldn't own land , this was what was left to them . On a side note that's one of the reasons for the State of Israel developing its own collective agricultural institution , the Kibbutz . It was to get Jews deliberate in touch with the land , to grow things on it and develop an attachment to it . Some of the other cast members of note are Geraldine Fitzgerald as a neighborhood settlement house social worker who tries to penetrate Steiger's catatonic personality and a really wonderful bit by Reni Santoni as a junkie trying to pawn a radio and jonesing to beat the band . Still the film is Rod Steiger's show , one of the few times he carried a film by himself and he does it magnificently .
Hiding from Horror	The film The Diary of Anne Frank is not taken directly from her world famous diary , but it is rather an adaption of a play based on that diary . The play was written by Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett and it ran on Broadway from 1955 to 1957 for 717 performances . Three members of the original Broadway cast did their roles for the screen , Joseph Schildkraut , Lou Jacobi , and Gusti Huber . Joseph Schildkraut as Otto Frank is the backbone of the film , providing the moral authority in the cast . He's a teacher and a scholar and makes sure that even under these circumstances , the education of his daughters is not neglected . Gusti Huber is Mrs . Frank and Lou Jacobi is Mr . Van Daan . The Van Daans and the Franks have been offered shelter in a third floor apartment that is kept secret by a hidden door in a factory owner . The owner Mr . Kraler played by Douglas Spencer is an anti-Nazi and has offered to keep these two Jewish families hidden for the duration of the war in Holland . For two years they live in that apartment and aside from radio news all they know of the outside world is that street in Amsterdam where the factory is located . Director George Stevens to keep the viewer from getting claustrophobic provides us with occasional shots of the outside street and canal . This film is the ultimate in cabin fever . But it has to be so for the Van Daans and the Franks are hiding for their lives . It's a community of necessity that's created up in the third floor . Young Millie Perkins does fine in the title role originated on Broadway by Susan Strassberg . She has an Audrey Hepburn like appeal , but never had the career Audrey certainly did . Her sister Margit is played by Diane Baker who's career was a bit more substantial . Two very normal average teenage girls , except that Anne has a talent for writing and observing . The frightening thing about this film is the very ordinariness of the characters . What have these people ever done that the might of the Nazi war machine should be out looking for them ? Some of them are certainly not noble specimens as the movie shows , but their lives are so humdrum like millions of us . Simply because for politics sake , someone was scapegoating a religion . Ed Wynn as Drussel the dentist and Shelley Winters as Mrs . Van Daan were nominated for supporting players in the male and female categories that year . Wynn lost , but Winters won the first of her two Oscars for this film . Up to then Ms . Winters played some pretty brassy characters in film . She fought for and won this role and got acclaim worldwide for her portrayal as a wife and mother . It was a transition into those kind of roles for her . So Anne observed and wrote about her impressions of what she saw and heard and the people around her for two years . In a sense this is like Moby Dick with the Pequod being the apartment and the white whale being the Nazis . Joseph Schildkraut is no Ahab , he's just trying to lead his community for survival . When the Nazis come , Anne's diary is hidden and after the war one of the community comes back and like Ishmael retrieves the diary and very much tells the tale . Anne's diary , the hopes and dreams of a teenage girl caught up in a world of hate she couldn't comprehend , is now classic literature . It serves as a dark reminder of the bestial nature we can sink to . And it reminds us that hope , courage and love can spring from the darkest places .
Perfect Series Television	I'm of the opinion that The Rockford Files did nothing less than save James Garner's career . I yield to no one in my admiration for this man as an actor . I read somewhere that it was said of him he makes every thing he's in just a little bit better by being there . But it was clear that his movie career at the time he was offered The Rockford Files was waning , he was not getting the good parts he once had on the big screen . What to do , but go back to television where Maverick had made him a big star . Though Garner's character and personality were certainly an integral part of the show , what I think set The Rockford Files apart was the terrific writing of each and every episode and the creation of some indelible characters . The best of course was Stuart Margolin as Angel Martin who was con man . Margolin did four or five episodes a year with The Rockford Files and he pulled Garner into one of his crazy schemes in every episode and Garner had to be resourceful to get them out . Garner was an ex-convict who apparently took a fall for some other people . His prison experience certainly toughened him and he went into the private detective business when paroled . Naturally the LAPD as do other police agencies don't like private eyes as a general rule and ex-con PIs really gets their collective backs up . Jim Rockford had a running battle with Lieutenant Chapman played beautifully by James Luisi who was never convinced Garner was on the up and up . Rockford had a good friend in Joe Santos as Sergeant later Lieutenant Dennis Becker who ran interference for him . He also had the support of his dad , Noah Beery , Jr . who was a retired truck driver and who occasionally got roped into some of Garner's cases as well . And he had a pretty lady lawyer Gretchen Corbett and with his relations with the cops , Garner had to have her on speed dial . Gretchen Corbett got a great career role in Beth Davenport . I'm not sure why she's not mentioned more as a feminist icon , a successful female professional if there ever was one on television . And other semi-recurring characters were folks like Isaac Hayes as Gandolf Finch another prison buddy , a man of few words and a demeanor that made Mr . T look like a friendly tour guide . Tom Selleck was here also as another private eye , Lance White , who kept getting credit for some of the grunt work Garner put in . This part led him to his own television series Magnum which in fact was patterned a lot on The Rockford Files . The show was rich with characters . The Rockford Files to me is perfect series television , entertaining without condescension to the lowest common denominator . After physical problems forced the cancellation , James Garner came back in the nineties to do several Rockford television films . They were good , but face it Garner was getting old and tending to the gut a bit more . With his recent stroke and the fact he's now 80 years old , I don't think another Rockford Files is in the cards . I wish it weren't so
My first Sinatra film	When The Joker Is Wild first came out I saw it at the Nostrand Theatre in Brooklyn , New York . It was the best possible first exposure to Frank Sinatra . He is first rate in this biographical film about the life of Joe E . Lewis . Later on in his film career , Sinatra walked through a lot of roles , but not in this . This is a perfect blend of his persona being tailor made for the part . The supporting cast of Eddie Albert , Jeanne Crain , Mitzi Gaynor , Jackie Coogan , Beverly Garland are also well cast and give Frank excellent support . I have a bootleg copy of this movie , but hopefully Paramount will put this out one day . The song All the Way is interestingly used in the film . When Joe E . Lewis is a cabaret singer , Sinatra sings it and of course first rate . Later on after the mobsters try to cut his throat and damage his vocal cords , it's used in the background as a reminder of what he had lost . I don't know if the real Joe E . Lewis ever did any records from back in the twenties . I have heard him do some of his stand-up routines in that gravelly voice the gangsters left him with . Sinatra might have ruptured his own valuable vocal cords if he ever tried to really imitate Lewis . Still it's a marvelous performance . All the Way won the Oscar in 1957 for Best Original Song , it was the first time a Sinatra song was so honored . Frank was never in better voice and it remains to this day my favorite Sinatra record . Don't ever miss The Joker Is Wild when it's broadcast .
