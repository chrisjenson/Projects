Am I the only one who found this really offensive ?	I remember when I was 11 and in Primary Seven ( which works out at Sixth Grade if your American ) when our teacher took the class through to the screening room to watch yet another sex education video . By this point , even as a bunch of 11-year-olds , we were all pretty jaded by this constant sex-ed stuff and rolled our eyes at having to suffer yet more ( this continued all they way to late-High School BTW , which we all found quite odd ) . The video in question that day ( and many days after that ) was Feeling Yes , Feeling No ; a Canadian Stage play acted out in front of kids younger than us on what to do if an adult sexually harasses you . Just say ( or shout ) NO was the answer . It had the sophistication of a 16-mm interstitial on Seasame Street . I remember it vividly to this day . And I remember being very offended by it , along with a lot of the other boys in my class . The reason for this is that every scenario acted out is a man taking advantage of or abusing a girl . I mean , does it never happen the other way around ? Will a woman never abuse a boy ? This aspect was stupidly left out and made the series entirely one-sided and just plain wrong . Honestly . After watching all these us guys felt guilty for no reason . We had done nothing wrong but were made to feel like sexual predators all because of this stupid series . We were all quite downcast for a few days and repeatedly voiced our anger at the teacher who typically ignored us . Even the girls treated us differently , saying stuff like ' You're all rapists . ' Which is just plain wrong no matter what way you look at it . This series of ' educational ' films is wrong and hopelessly sexist . I am sure something this old is not shown in schools anymore and I pray that something more PC ( and trust me , I HATE PC ) is part of sex-ed now . Oh , and what a god-awful ' theme ' song too . I don't think I'll ever get it out of my head . Like the Macarena or Agadoo .
Extrememly Bad	Lord have mercy ! Why was this film made ? Why did Seagal and rising star Max Ryan agree to be in it ? The Foreigner is so excruciatingly bad in every conceivable way that it boggles the mind . The film has an ultra-cheap look to it . Like a budget of a couple of bucks was far out of their reach . What's worse is that the makers know this and try to make it look slick to compensate . The result is a film that just don't look right . The fight scenes are so dull and edited ' discretely ' to hide the fact that Steven Seagal is not in good shape anymore . None of them are engaging or exciting . The plot is nonsense that doesn't interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it . The Eastern-Europe locations ( a sly move by the producers to keep the budget down , or non-existent ) look unpleasant and should not be serving as the backdrop for an ' action ' film ( what action ? ) . And what is the deal with the title ? As far as I could tell everyone in the movie was foreign . Which ONE does the title refer to ? The DVD is in 1 . 85 : 1 anamorphic widescreen and in Dolby 5 . 1 sound . Neither are remarkable enough to warrant even a single rent . The Foreigner is not worth one second of your time . Gotta love that tagline tho ! ' If they think they can stop him , they're dead wrong . ' Sheesh !
Crap sequel , makes no sense . Get the Japanese version !	Ever since SOR 3 came out in 1994 I wanted it . I never actually managed to get my hands on it until last year as it went for insane prices on auction sites and was very , VERY hard to come by in video game stores . Luckily for me I was given it as a present from someone clearing out their attic . I couldn't wait to get home and play it . All I could think about was loads of hours of solid beat-em-up action and a return of those ultra-cool tunes by Yuzo Koshiro that made the first 2 games so memorable . As soon as I started to play I was shocked that Streets of Rage is actually a really , really bad game that may be impressive in terms of graphics but in regards to music and gameplay is far , far behind even the first . First of all the game is just too damn hard . And you need to play it in hard mode otherwise you won't be able to get past level 5 . And this time we're given a little bit more story and cut-scenes between the game levels . If you're playing the American or European release of this game I'd just skip these as they do not make sense and there are holes everywhere . The Japanese version ( Bare Knuckle 3 ) has a different plot entirely and looks and feels like the REAL Streets of Rage 3 . In SOR 3 the story has Mr . X , in what limited capacity he now exists in , kidnap the Chief of Police and plant bombs all over city . He wants to replace high-ranking officials with evil robots . Or something ! So , typically , the gang set about smashing the Syndicate AGAIN as their way of stopping him . However , in Bare Knuckle 3 the opening cut-scenes with the nuclear explosion show the destruction of a city called ' Wood Oak ' that was the first victim of a radioactive bomb powered by the newly discovered element 122 , Laxine . The victims are given as an estimated 30 , 000 dead and 80 , 000 injured . In a letter from Blaze to Axel she says that the Syndicate's laboratories seem to be involved in the research of Laxine and that a group in favor of a war with the country of Lima have captured the army general Petrov . Mr . X tries to start a nuclear war by replacing the anti-war U . S . General with Shiva before a speech at the White House . In SOR 3 ' City Hall ' looks suspiciously like the White House so I'm led to believe that the level was just recycled and renamed . In Bare Knuckle 3 you have to successfully prevent a devastating war by rescuing the general and the destruction in the city is just a slap in the face , while in SOR3 you basically have failed your task if you let the time run out ( the General , now ' Chief of Police ' is killed with poisonous gas ) . If you rescue the Chief in time you go straight to Mr . X's island lab , but if he dies you go to City Hall / White House . Second , Yuzo Koshiro's music is HORRIBLE . What happened ? The first 2 games had awesome music that showed what the meagre Sega Genesis was capable of . The man was truly a pioneer when it came to composing stunning music for simple machines . In SOR 3 there are no cool tunes at all . It's all pathetic , tepid Industrial junk that would sound rancid coming from an Atari . A MAJOR let-down . SOR 3 also has deleted characters that feature only in the Japanese version . Namely the character of ' Ash ' who looks very , very homosexual and resembles Bennett from Commando or one of The Village People . I guess the PC Powers That Be thought the Western World couldn't handle such obvious gayness . The dialogue is also censored and ' naughty ' words are replaced with ' clean ' words . Character names are also radically and inexplicably different . If you want this badly then the Japanese version is the ONLY way to go . Seriously , it's a complete disappointment otherwise . I'm not saying that the Japanese version is great , it's only slightly better .
Crap	What a horrible game ! I would describe Dick Tracy as a run-and-gun platformer but that would kind of a lie as it is horrible slow and plodding with no sense of excitement at all . It's one of those horrible games where that generic baddies shoot at you and you see this little white dot that is supposed to be a bullet move across the screen very slowly . In real life it would easy to dodge but the little Dick Tracy sprite moves likes he's stuck in cement . There are some levels where you shoot the place up but you can do very little damage and since nothing becomes of it other than the background changing slightly , it's kinda pointless . The music is awful too . Who makes these awful tunes ? The graphics do resemble the bright primary colors of the comic-strip though and it's pretty much the only positive thing I can say about this otherwise completely disposable game . Graphics Sound Gameplay Lasting Appeal
Worst film of Summer 2006	In a summer that also boasted such repugnant stinkers as Snakes on a Plane and The Da Vinci Code , that's a pretty bold statement . But I stand by it nonetheless . Superman Returns , like King Kong 6 months before it , is overlong , hyper-indulgent and with CGI up to the eyeballs . My God , this stuff is doing my head in . Richard Donner had the idea of ' keep it real ' for his 2 outings . And I do find his approach to the special and optical effects to be the most appropriate . Brian Singer bombards us with so much CGI that it really takes you out of the story and constantly reminds you that you are watching a wannabe blockbuster that thinks that the only way to impress an audience is to spend $250 million ( a totally irresponsible amount of money ) on obnoxious visual effects that don't live up to the hype . We've seen everything and been everywhere that CGI can take us . There's no real atmosphere or involvement in this . And for a film that is 95 % made up of this crap . . . well you figure it out . I've read so many reviews from fanboy critics about how the movie has ' soul ' or ' a human heart ' or ' tender character moments ' . Puh-lease ! We've already had brooding superheros silently screaming ' you'd love me if you knew who I am ' dozens of times already in recent years and SR offers absolutely NOTHING new in this regard . Even the plot is recycled garbage . Lex Luthor ( a seriously mis-cast and hammy Kevin Spacey ) plotting to destroy the landmass of America was done in the first film already ! And , well . . . that's your lot ! It's amazing that they managed to draw out this junk to 2 . 5 painful hours ! Even if the cast were likable it would make it less unbearable . But Brandon Routh has the on screen personality of a mahogany hat-stand , Kate Bosworth is completely unconvincing as a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist , James Marsden is 250 % wooden , as usual and Kevin Spacey really needs to either fire his agent or acquire some better judgement . The only cast member I liked was the lovely Parker Posey . But I'm into weird-looking girls . Every year films like this get bigger and more bombastic . Pretty soon we'll have $300 million films . Studios need to realise that maybe they should start looking down instead of looking up . For all the money that Warner spent on this pile of crap , for all the resources that this movie cost to make . . . was it worth it ? In my opinion , certainly not ! This garbage has put me of Superman for life !
Very odd and not very enjoyable beat-em-up .	I played this in the arcade while on holiday with my girlfriend . Neither of us were very impressed by the disorientating style of the game which just crammed in too many ideas at once and ended up a confusing mess . Much like Double Dragon 3 . You can play as either a Ninja or Cowboy ( of course the 2 go together after all ! ) and fight your way through many levels such as war torn cities , deserts and floating castles and flying ships , beating up Nazis , Monks , huge dragons , giant zombie skeletons and those guys with baskets on their heads ( like in Big Trouble in Little China ) . You can also turn into various animals and . . . aw hell with it . I cannot explain this game in any sense-making way because the game itself didn't make sense . It was very weird and not that much fun to play . Once we kicked in the head of the final bad guy we were just glad that this curious oddity was over and that we didn't have to suffer it's strangeness anymore .
Horrid	I loved the first Sonic Adventure game ( Gamecube remake ) and I only expected this one to be as good , if not better . But , boy was I wrong . It's a truly horrible game that's scattered all over the place with no non-linear progression or free roaming abilities of the original . The graphics are ugly , the camera system is the worst I have ever come across and the levels are tiresome and repetitive . Where's the dynamic gameplay of the first game ? Or the cool mini-games that keep you coming back again and again ? It was just ugly and garish and far inferior to Sonic Adventure . Do not buy or rent . I can only hope and pray that Sonic Heros is better because I have already bought it .
I Grudge paying for this	Ugh ! What nonsense . American remakes of Japanese horrors are all the rage at the moment . Between this , The Ring and a forthcoming remake of the rather weak Dark Water it seems as if Hollywood has tapped into a new well of unimagination . Which is weird , considering how pointless this remake is . Its only purpose is to serve those who cannot be bothered reading subtitles as the same director and some of the original cast remain as well as the fact that it's set in Japan . If they were bothering to remake it then why change 2 things ? The presence of English dialogue and mostly new actors seems a vague reason to redo this film . As PG-13 rated horrors go , this one is still scraping the bottom of the barrel . Seriously , The Grudge is the dredge of horror . I've not seen the original , despite being ' asked kindly ' to do so . But I could still see every scare coming . You just know because of the camera angles suddenly changing to an off-centre shot to accommodate something new . Either that or a scene of silence is built up so much that a sudden jolt is the only logical end . Unlike The Ring , there is no mystery to this film . It's all very straight-forward and , in the end , just boils down to typical slasher fare . Or scare-em-to-death fare as no one is physically killed in this film . Other than the Yoko character . Her fate made no sense and did not fit in with the internal ' logic ' of the script . And can someone explain Bill Pullman's actions at the beginning for me ? A very poor film indeed . Very repetitive , very slow and utterly pointless . As a horror film , The Grudge has as much integrity as Darkness Falls . This film is basically a cure . . . for NOT being asleep .
Not sure about the title !	Perhaps Casting Grizzlies would have been more appropriate . I've never seen a duller porno in my life . Only one of the girls does anal ( really blandly ) , the rest is plain-old straight sex . Meat , potatoes and English gravy . No spice ! I only watched it to see fake reality-TV show BB reject Lea Walker do her porn thing . She's not really much to look at but I thought it would be worth it to see her get nasty . How massively WRONG I was ! It starts off with Lea getting interviewed as usual and it seems that she has not had one part of her body , from head to toe , left un-surgically altered . I have no beef with plastic / cosmetic surgery at all , but when a person leaves looking less human then when they went in , I can't help but get freaked out . It wouldn't be so bad if the major slicing and stitching didn't leave her with such a numb , frozen face that prohibited exhibition of any kind of emotion or personality . The sex that she gets involved in is mind-numbingly boring . She shows as much enthusiasm for shagging as a cow going to the slaughter-house . And the crap she comes out with ? Don't get me started ! ' Oh yeah , that's good . Yes . A-ha . Mmm-hmm . Yeah ! Yeah ! ' Pathetic ! Not only is it totally phony , but it's like she's only ever seen one porno in her life and thought it would be okay to do ' stock porn dialogue ' . My god ! You've never seen porn worse than this !
Horrid	This is a truly garish platformer . You play the title character , who can detach he head and chuck it at people . That's how you kill the bad guys . He's not the best character ever and you won't have fun playing him . The main problem with this game is that there are far too many backgrounds , sub-backgrounds , foregrounds , middle foreground etc . that you never really know where the character is or if it is safe to jump . Plus they are all moving which becomes very distracting . The color scheme is simply horrid . Nothing buck sickeningly bright pastel colors that make the game look like a packet of skittles more than anything else . I can only see this game being popular in Japan . The English translation just doesn't work . The story is something to do with an evil circus and rescuing your pals . Already done that in Rolo to the Rescue . Sorry . Stay well and truly away from this . It's even worse than that game where the robots turn into blingwads . A truly appalling experience .
Very poor game	Well , maybe that's a gross understatement . This is really one of the worst games the Genesis ever saw . Which is such a shame considering the great possibilities the Looney Tunes license had . The gameplay is rubbish and the fun is absolute zero . The mildly cute graphics that were dated at the time and totally redundant now . It does not show off what the Genesis was capable of and is surely one of the worst platformers ever . Don't even buy out of morbid curiosity or even if you are a hardcore Looney Toons fan . I am . And I hated it with a passion . Graphics C Sound C Gameplay F Lasting Appeal
Christ , they made FOUR sequels to THIS ! ! !	I really can't think of a word more appropriate than ' tawdry ' to describe this incredibly boring drek . It may well have been regarded as hardcore back in the early seventies ( but I don't see how ) but Death Wish is actually as tame as a newborn kitten , especially in comparison to the first sequel . Ironically surnamed director Michael Winner shoots the film in the most mundane and sterile way possible . You'd be forgiven for thinking that you're watching a slide show . And ugly photography doesn't help the brain-dead plot . Charles Bronson ( typically void of emotion or expression ) is Paul Kersey , an architect based in NYC and a ' bleeding heart liberal ' apparently . When a bunch of thugs ( including a young , completely nonthreatening Jeff Goldblum ) break into his house , beat-up and sexually attack ( but not rape ) his daughter he changes his views . After his wife mysteriously dies from her not-really-that-bad wounds he cracks and decides that killing random thugs on the streets is the best thing to do . Remember this was the early 70s and back then NYC was rife with crime and muggings . Michael Loser probably thought he was onto some groundbreaking commentary when an ordinary man takes the law into his own hands because the police are incompetent . But here's the stupid thing , the cops may not care about innocent people being killed so why the hell do they make a HUGE case out of the first vigilante killing ? They don't care when decent civilians die but make a circus over some random shot junkie ? Nonsense ! I could call this part of the film ' fun ' but since it takes ages to really get going I was already sighing and checking how much time was left . At 85 minutes I was beginning to wonder how he was ever going to find the people who attacked his family and sort them out with only a few minutes of the running time left . It turns out that they are never seen again , so they basically get away it . WHAT KIND OF ENDING IS THAT ? ? ? What a rip-off . Compared to Death Wish II ( my God , what a disgusting film ) this film seems relatively okay . But alone it's yet another exploitational piece of crap by a notoriously incompetent director . A classic is sure as hell ain't !
Worst FX Ever !	After starring in a movie such as Vampires one would expect Thomas Ian Griffith to not make a movie like this . It's about an evil company that builds an oil pipeline thru a snowy mountain town and causes an avalanche when it goes haywire . The avalanche FX and the terribly interwoven stock footage are the worst I've ever seen . You'll have a hot seeing how awful it is and how anyone involved with the film could allow them to be so poor . See this on TV like I did . Don't rent it . It's seriously bad .
Overlong , bigheaded , disjointed mess	Ever seen a film with 86 endings ? No ? Well should the urge ever overcome you , Oceans's Twelve is the only film that refuses to just wrap up the ' plot ' for good . There are about a zillion climaxes that are all anti-climatic . Steven Soderbergh couldn't even get one of them right ? Andy Garcia comes back and demands that Ocean's 11 give him back the money they stole , plus extra . So they go off to Europe to steal things by not stealing them and not really planning anything at all . The whole film is made up of narcissistic filler . Ooooohh it's all so sophisticated and cool isn't it ? Puh-lease . This movie shouldn't have been made . Ocean's Eleven may have worked well but Twelve was taken from a non-related script called ' Honor Among Thieves ' and adapted into a sequel , that no one asked for . So how do you go about cramming in 12 main characters into a story that did not have 12 main characters ? You can't . As a result Ocean's 12 never interact all at once . Several characters are left with nothing to do , forgotten about , stand about like idiots , fight for even a couple of lines of dialogue ( all sarcastic , self-aware , notionally ' cool ' dialogue btw ) , disappear , reappear , wonder what the hell they're doing , forget who they are etc . . . It's just plain horrible and too convoluted and contrived for its own good . The whole film seems out of order and you are frequently left wondering what on earth is going on . This elitist , condescending attitude makes us feel like the movie was made for the cast instead of us . Plus Julia Roberts looks dreadful in this . She's very pale and thin and gaunt-looking . I thought I was looking at Skeletor to begin with . And if you don't believe how sickeningly ' clever ' the film thinks it is , a certain plot development has Julia Roberts play Tess Ocean playing Julia Roberts ( oh stop , that's too ingenious for my feeble , average movie-goer mind ) . Somehow Catherine Zeta Jones comes off a prettier , if not a better actress ( I do NOT like Catherine Zeta Jones-but she was an exception here when compared to the Plain Jane Julia Roberts ) as her accent is still all over the place . The only good bit about the film is Vincent Cassell in a small supporting role as a master thief ( like everyone else in the film ) . Funny how his one character is more interesting than a dozen others combined . Plus , we actually get to see him do stuff other than stand around . Which helps . Don't waste your time with this film . Life is too short and there are other , better , shorter movies than this out at the moment . Ocean's Twelve is a dirty dozen .
Live PG-13 or Die Soft	A Die Hard 4 was discussed and thrown around for years . There was a point when Tears of the Sun was supposed to be Die Hard 4 , with John McClane crashing a plane in the jungle and leading the survivors to safety through a war-zone . In my opinion , the series ended perfectly with the brilliant Die Hard With A Vengeance . After so many false starts it's been 12 years since we last saw John McClane . He was in his late 30s then , now he's in his early 50s . A lot has happened to Hollywood action films in that space of time . By that I mean they have lost their nerve and all of their edge . Too often our summer movies are nothing but PG-13 crap , designed for the kiddies . Die Hard has always been a hardcore action series , it is a slap in the face and an insult to fans that this unnecessary fourth instalment be aimed at an audience that was only 1-year old when the DHWAV was released and an audience that is STILL not old enough to see any of those movies in the first place . But asides from that , LFODH has it's own problems that not even an R-rating could fix . First of all . . . Len Wiseman ! Why the hell did Fox give this precious franchise to a man who has only directed two awful Underworld movies ? Did they learn nothing from AVP when they gave hack Paul Anderson control ? We all know what garbage that ended up being . Ironically surnamed Wiseman's style of direction just does NOT suit Die Hard . Gone is the naturalised look of McTiernan and even Harlin . In it's place is a horrid low brightness / high contrast look that has been popular in this post-Michael Bay world . It makes the action and locations quite blurred and incoherent and it sticks out like a sore thumb compared to the other movies . And what's with that silly font in the opening credits ? DH2 and DHWAV didn't even have opening credits . McClane , still a NYPD Detective , despite the ending of DHWAV ( hints at alcoholism and being a suspect in the Federal Reserve raid ) is sent to pick up computer wiz-kid Matt Farrell ( Justin Long , who doesn't appear to be ageing ) to help the NSA figure out why computer networks across the country are malfunctioning . Right away nameless baddies are onto them but McClane offs them no sweat . But not all of them , he foolishly leaves the main henchmen alive for some reason ( to make more movie ) . It turns out that shockingly unscary ' terrorist ' Thomas Gabriel ( Timothy Elephant ) is behind the computer villainery and is out for revenge against the government for firing him after all the hard work he put in for them ( just like Travis Dane in Under Siege 2 ) . He's got the brains and the manpower to take the entire US network in to his vice-like grip and send the country back to the stone age . No one can find him since all of his equipment is packed onto a large moving vehicle to keep the signal's transparent and untraceable ( just like Travis Dane in Under Siege 2 ) . Oh God . . . why did they not get someone else to play this character ? Timothy Elephant clearly has no clue how to play a baddie . His idea of sounding threatening is to to move his lips around while talking but never actually opening his mouth . Ooooh . . . gee don't hurt me ! And why Kevin Smith ? This really was a step too far . This man doesn't belong in a Die Hard film , plain and simple . All this was was a wink at the audience and another excuse for him to plug Star Wars for the 86 millionth time . Wrong , just wrong ! The action scenes are mildly entertaining , but they are shot and cut with the usual post-Michael Bay confusion . You never really feel like your part of it or feel McClane's danger . And I am sick of Willis and Co . promoting this are ' old-school ' with ' real stunts ' . You can clearly tell that the majority of it is still crappy CGI . And the cop car / helicopter explosion is just too far-fetched , regardless of how much you can suspend your disbelief . Did a five-year-old write this ? That kind of stunt may work fine when you're playing with your Matchbox cars but not in a Die Hard movie . The lack of swearing didn't bother me too much . You can tell that they did have a lot of cussing in the original cut but were forced to loop some ADR over the top of it after studio pressure . This clearly means that there will be uncut DVD with some perverse title like ' The YipeeKayay Unrated Edition with hardcore footage THEY wouldn't let you see in cinemas ' . Marco Beltrami's score is also a total letdown . After his autopilot hack-job of Terminator 3 , why did they let him have control of someone else's themes ? The late Michael Kamen did some great stuff on the Die Hard movies but Beltrami only uses his fourth most reoccurring cue and ditches the rest , save for a cue from Die Hard 2 . To me , Die Hard finished in 1995 . This film , which was only made to spark some life into a flopping career , is just a tame action film starring Bruce Willis . It's not Die Hard . This one definitely will NOT ' blow you through the back wall of the theatre ' . Oh . . . and Mr . Writer , if you paid any attention to the other movies you'd know that McClane's son is called John Jnr , not Jack . It seems like you don't know Jack actually .
What the hell is going on in this movie ?	Courtroom dramas are so out of date . Which is why this sub-genre is confined mostly to rubbishy TV-movies these days . In A Civil Action there was just too much legal jargon for me to understand . If find that most audiences feel a bit alienated by technical gobbledygook . The comedy wasn't really funny and seemed out of place . Most characters just seemed to be nameless . There were just too many to remember and they weren't really all that interesting to begin with . The film also had very little drama . It was quite a labor to get through this guff . I think it was never really intended to be more than a potboiler . Catch it on TV if you're that desperate . It's where it belongs .
Pretty weak cartoon	In this short , the Pink Panther is just relaxing in his house when a mouse appears from his hole in the wall and helps himself to the fridge . A call to the exterminator ( one of the cartoon's few laughs ) proves to be fruitless as does any futile pursuit of the rodents . Many unfunny things follow until Pinky discovers a convenient book in his library called ' How to catch Mice ' . It instructs him to dress up as a cat ( even though Panthers are cats ) to scare them away . It works , but he is then chased by dogs . Not really that funny and rather misjudged as we've seen ' cat and mouse ' action a hundred times before with Tom and Jerry .
This franchise is dead , as I predicted . How ironic !	' Anticipation of dead is worse than death itself . ' These are the immortal words of Steven Seagal in Hard to Kill . Had he seen any of the movies in this franchise I'm sure he would have changed it to ' Final Destination is worse than death itself . ' A babe ( the very cute Mary Elizabeth Winstead ) predicts a roller-coaster will crash send many stereotyped , stock-teenage characters to their early / deserved death . She flips and demands to be let off , taking a few others with her . She was right , the train comes off the tracks and everyone dies . Only we don't even see it ! The survivors start dying in freak accidents , the secrets of their deaths revealed in their last photographs taken by stock-babe at the carnival before the accident . Thus , starts a plot we've seen twice before as babe and stock-sympathetic ' hunk ' go around all the other survivors trying to convince them to stay safe or something . But , as usual , they are complete idiots and don't listen and soon enough their brain matters have painted the ceilings , walls and floors after some overly-contrived death set-up . Yawn ! I'll be open right away and tell you that I thought that the first Final Destination was horrendous . It came out in a time where teen horror films starring actors well into their twenties were in high abundance and watching ' teenagers ' die one by one was cool again . This may sound hypocritical by a ' Friday the 13TH ' fan but Final Destination's morbid fascination with brutally killing people is a little unsettling . I'm not sure if we're supposed to laugh or scream at this stuff . And despite using the word ' brutal ' we don't really see that much . It's the method of death rather than the mess of it . The second film was a bit better , but hardly brilliance . I'll attribute that to David R . Ellis who is a better director than James Wong , who returns for this movie . Along with The One ( another rotten film ) he's proving himself to be a bit of a hack incapable of directing anything other than brain-dead eye-candy . He does shoot this film in widescreen , which gives it a bigger scope over the other two ( I found the bland and flat photography of the first film to be one of the worst things about it ) but he still doesn't fill it with anything interesting or even the slightest bit of atmosphere . Hardly impressive for a film about death himself . I hope this is the end of the line and Final Destination has reached its final destination . Any more entries in this series can only be outright robbery . Dick Turpin at least wore a mask ! As more of these films come out , the more I am reminded of Police Academy . We keep paying our hard earned pennies for this guff but all New Line are really doing is changing the poster and reserving the bore they did before . Well not anymore ! This goat has been milked dry . The dead horse cannot be flogged any further . Money cannot be made from this old rope . This franchise is DEAD !
I don't like racing games .	So maybe I'm the wrong person to be doing a review . But they are all basically the same and while Double Dash looks pretty it does little to further the genre . The graphics are , quite simply , gorgeous . Mario Kart Double Dash shows what the Gamecube is capable of with brilliant colors , wonderful landscapes and vivid race courses . The sound isn't up to much though . Sound effects are kind of generic and the music is hardly a standout . Pretty much , if racing games are for you then Mario Kart Double Dash is essential if you have a Gamecube . I couldn't care less about this genre so I can gladly never play again , no matter how stunning it looks .
Why are you still watching ?	The Last Horror Movie thinks that it's more clever than it actually is . It begins by telling us that we've never quite seen horror as intense as this and that we're truly in for the ride of our lives . While some of the following murders are interesting , it completely fails at living up to such high self-regard . It's a film within a film . Sort of . We begin by watching a the REAL Last Horror movie , a direct to video slasher with bad acting and wobbly sets , but after a few minutes of that ( a cunning ploy to make what follows look good by comparison ) some guy appears and claims to have taped over it with his own home-made horror ( obviously he has a full editing suite somewhere in his house ) and tells his own story of killing and torture . Why would be bother watching this ? Well we supposedly rented the fake horror movie so what's wrong with wanting to witness some real horror ? He never seems to shut up about this . The guy in question is Max Parry , a mild-mannered ( to the point of being a bit camp ) wedding planner with a healthy relationship with his family , despite not being married himself . He's nice to his grandmother and good with the kids . No one would ever think him a psycho killer . But death and torture are his thing indeed . He's hired a homeless cameraman ( who is Scottish , therefor by English law must be portrayed as a total mongo ) to follow him around and capture his killings on film . Some of them are innocent and would really rather not be dead , but others are twats who deserve it . Max has no quibbles about killing old or young , man or woman , black or white . He never explains why he does it , but only justifies his actions by waffling on about twisted morals . Max claims the best part of horror movies is witnessing the kill . But most of his murders occur off-camera , which is a bit of a rip-off . I'll admit there is one cool scene in which a bully is immolated and another where he stabs a housewife , but I wanted more blood and perhaps some dismemberment . So much for being the last word in horror movies . Another problem is that the convoluted narrative constantly conflicts itself and could never actually add up in real life . Sad people like me notice this and it kind of distracts from the point the film is trying to make . And the ending could only ever be scary if one is half-baked . I can't imagine any clear-headed person getting even the slightest bit chilled by it at all . It's an ambitious project and I feel bad for rating it so poorly , but it's rather pretentious and just doesn't offer enough gruesomeness for the particularly blood-thirsty . If this really is the Last Horror Movie then it's a shame that the genre had end on such a weak note .
Do YOU believe in ghosts ?	Having seen two different ghosts on separate occasions in my life , then my answer is , most definitely , yes . And no , I wasn't dreaming . I wasn't allowed to see this show back when it originally aired back in 1992 , my mother and aunt were busy keeping the living room for their own drunken yacking . But I did sneak in a couple of times and saw a couple of definitive bits such as the ghost of Pipes appearing behind the curtains . I never knew it was a sham at the time but was intrigued nonetheless . Afterwards , BBC 2 screened Halloween 2 and I was more freaked out by that . But then came Sunday and the whole of Britain was buzzing about it . That particular Saturday night was probably the most iconic Halloween in a long time . The BBC even kept the show hidden away for many years afterwards because of all the controversy it stirred up . So anyone who has memories of being scared back then have not been able to see the show up until recently since the British Film Institute released a DVD . Fifteen years on , in the middle of a reality TV craze and with inattentive audiences , Ghostwatch would certainly not work in 2007 . People now are just too cynical and no one really watches TV on a Saturday night now . There are many other distractions . It was the fact that so many people at Halloween parties , kids and adults alike , were fooled by this that made it so notorious . And there was hardly any advertising for Ghostwatch either and the only way people would know what was on is by checking the TV guides . Now we have the internet and almost every element of a production is scrutinized before anyone sees it . You could say that it was part of Ghostwatch's power that despite hardly any advertising and being bookended with ' this is not real ' that was taken so seriously . But that would an absurd statement . It's a pretty affair . The acting and direction is often stale and clumsy but the subliminal shots of Pipes going unnoticed by the crew make it so brilliant to watch . Set up like a Crimewatch show we have Parkinson in the studio with a Parapsychologist discussing the Pipes phenomena and other ghost stories while Sarah Greene and Craig ' No Talent Whatsoever ' Charles are on location in a council estate where Pipes the ghost is making life a misery for the Early family . As you can imagine , there's a lot of hand-held camera action and quick glimpses of the ghost . I've spotted about seven but there may be more . It's rather dated and badly acted but it's still got enough in it to be interesting in these cynical times . Just try to blank out Craig Charles , why he was chosen to be in this I'll never know . I just wish that the BBC went further and push Ghostwatch to the max instead of mainly just playing it safe .
Not Dracula's house .	Count Dracula and Larry Talbot ( the Wolfman ) turn up at Doctor Edelman's house asking for a cure . But they have to get in line behind hunchback nurse . Edelman has found a new sort of fungus with potential cure possibilities and the best place to grow it is in an old cave beneath the house . This just happens to be where the quicksand has deposited Frankenstein's monster . You just know that this is not going to end well . There's a decent amount of drama but little action and no scares . Once again it is set in no place in particular with English and American accents all over the place ( said ' place ' is a village straight out the European dark ages ) ) . Worth watching only for nostalgic value .
Not as bad as most would have you believe .	While not a masterpiece of any kind ( the film barely exceeds mere competence ) I didn't find D & D to be as bad as the negative reviews claimed . I put off watching it for so long for this reason , but it was enjoyable enough . Comparisons to the LOTR trilogy are inevitable , so I'm not going to avoid it . I didn't really like the LOTR trilogy . It just seemed to be a bunch of movies that everyone was forced to like and if you didn't then there must be something wrong with you . Yes , they are much , much better made than the rather quaint D & D , but if you want a smaller , unassuming fantasy ride then don't completely rule this movie out . The visual effects and production design of D & D are very similar to Paul Anderson's Mortal Kombat . Yes , it looks fake , but with just a little bit of suspension of disbelief you'll not even notice . I have a feeling that Courtney Solomon tried really hard to make it a good film but his talent doesn't extend as far as his enthusiasm . In terms of character and story it is all pretty bland and generic . There's nothing in this movie that you haven't seen somewhere else . The actors do their best with the tepid dialogue and almost manage to not look embarrassed . The best thing about the film is it's surprisingly ferocious ( maybe a bit too OTT ) sound design . And the Dragon fight at the end was impressive for a medium budget film . I was actually surprised to find Joel Silver's name on the closing credits . I will assume that without him the film would have been a REAL stinker . And what's with that ending ? Either way , I am still interested in the sequel .
A significant lack of scares .	Wishing Stairs is the least scary of the Yeogo Goedam films so far ( I've still to see the fourth however ) . It's just the same old clichés of ' be careful what you wish for ' done in a South Korean girls school . It's like Wishmaster gone Asian with a bit of Grange Hill thrown in for abstract measure . The windy atmosphere is don again , the lesbian love thing is done AGAIN and the old , dusty secret room is done again too . In fact , when I think about it , this movie is nothing more than some rehashed scenes from the first two . It's not boring in any way , but is certainly not scary and not a film I could sit through again .
' This is very , very exasperating . '	In this cartoon an ungainly and annoying goose called Gus turns up at Donald's house with a note from Aunt Fanny ( ? ) claiming that he is his cousin and is here for a visit . The note also says he doesn't eat much , which turns out to be a total lie since Gus proceeds to eat Donald out of house and home and turn an otherwise peaceful , non-stressful day for Donald into bedlam . Gus is an annoying character but thankfully he doesn't say much and only ever makes a honking sound when he wants attention , which he does by squeezing his ass ! Much like Donald , I hope to never see Gus again . And this cartoon ain't that great I'm afraid .
No better , no worse	Spoofs are old hat . They are outdated and there's no real point to them anymore . Modern audiences are FAR more cynical than they used to be and can easily pick up on a movie's foibles . We don't need stuff like this to remind us how naff some films can be . The Scary Movie franchise seems to be in the uncomfortable groove of releasing a new instalment every 2 years . Now we're onto the fourth ( and final chapter of the trilogy ) and the movies that Zucker and co are choosing to lampoon are already confined to the trash-bin of history . Thus rendering the film mostly purposeless . Aside from War of the Worlds , Scary Movie 4 rips to shreds The Village and The Grudge , two horror films that were so downright awful that they don't need a spoof to point out how stupid they were . And generic horror films come and go with such abundance these days that no one really gives a damn about either of these two anymore . Another thing I hate about spoofs ( or at least this kind of spoof ) is that they always ungracefully grab as many films as they can , mash them together and cook up some moronic plot as a way of stringing a bunch of simple-minded sketches together . When people are given the job / chore of directing a movie they should keep in mind that they are being given the chance to be really creative . And if they churn out something as mass-produced and common as the stuff they're meant to be making fun of then allow me to laugh out loud at the irony . Scary Movie 4 IS funny . But it's half enjoyable , half total , pointless crap . There are some great digs at Tom Cruise ( who I am sick of the sight of ) and Michael Jackson . But why the hell are they spoofing Million Dollar Baby and Brokeback Mountain when they're no even horror films ? And why is King Kong on the poster when he's not even in the bloody movie ? It's no better and no worse than the other Scary Movies . But it's a low-aiming series that only really appeals to the lowest common denominator . David Zucker has proved himself to be a good comedy director with Baseketball and Rat Race . This is truly beneath him , though that won't stop the masses from lapping it up .
Better than Infernal Affairs , but still more of a mess than it is a masterwork .	Unfortunately there are millions of people out there who will watched this movie with a positive bias as most believe that Martin Scorsese is utterly infallible , but I am strictly in the middle with this director . I know I am going to be totally controversial ( and perhaps SHOCKING ) when I admit that I really hated Goodfellas . Now , before you immediately vote against my review , just please read on so I can explain myself . I find Goodfellas to be one of the most ridiculously over-rated movies in history ( along with DePalma's phenomenally misinterpreted pile of crap Scarface ) but I do LOVE Casino . They are almost two sides of the same coin , so you can see how I am split over Scorsese . I saw the original Infernal Affairs a few years ago and I hated it too . Yes , some good moments , but mainly an over-wrought bore . It's not because it is an Asian film , as I often enjoy them , but I just found it to be slightly inaccessible and alienating . Scorsese's remake is easier to identify with but is also a whole 50 minutes longer . The plot has undercover cop Leo Dicaprio infiltrate the Boston Irish Mafia in order to flush out a mole in the Police Department . Matt Damon is that mole and his job is to flush out the undercover cop in the Mafia . Martin Sheen , Mark Wahlberg and Jack Nicolson play the respective bosses , lawful and lawless . Within this set-up characters bounce back and forth off each other , swearing , shooting , swearing and swearing . Man , this film is effing hardcore ! ( Sarcasm ! ) Asking Jack Nicolson to play evil is like asking a Rottwieler to bark . It's what he does best . ' Ooh , but what about all the subtle nuances ? ' Come on , it's an easy , easy performance for someone like him and it's nothing you ain't seen him do before . The best performance actually comes from Matt Damon , closely followed by Mark Wahlberg ( if you ever had trouble telling the difference between them then don't see this movie ) . The cinematography is ugly as sin . Scorsese has gone for the same dull as hell color pallet of brown , brown and dark brown he used in Goodfellas . Yes , I know this film is not supposed to be bright , happy colors and blue skies . But if the dank colors are supposed to reflect the gritty realism of the doomed plot threads then they totally contradict the perfectly set-up camera angles . I am not saying that this film could only have been shot in a Paul Greengrass style jitter but a little less and a little more of the former and latter could have set the balance straight . And the plot is completely all over the place . If you get into this movie you'll walk out of the cinema shocked and astonished , which will make you forget about some things that simply don't add up . Since I had already seen Infernal Affairs I didn't gasp at the ending when the rest of the audience sucked the air out of the cinema . I was too busy trying to make sense of it all , but you can't because there are too many holes in it . Remakes are becoming more and more common these days and they are increasingly scoffed at ( even when they are really good , such as Dawn of the Dead 2004 or Poseidon ) but as soon as apparently unimperfect Martin Scorsese does one most of you turn a blind eye to the fact that the film is near-enough a shot-for-shot remake itself . I don't think it took a great amount of talent to crank out a film like this . And where the hell the $90 million budget went to is the REAL mystery ! But lads will love it . The screening I went to was sold out to many groups of 10 or 15 guys and metrosexuals with their blonde girlfriends . I am mentioning this because The Departed ( like 2004's Crash ) is a film that philistines go to see because it makes them feel clever . Sort of like penance for watching crud like When a Stranger Calls or The Fog . I just wish that people would find THEIR OWN good movies instead of always choosing what everyone else likes . Which is the only reason I can give for Goodfellas being so mysteriously well-regarded . Martin Scorsese is not the Mafia expert he thinks he is . Boston is not his turf . It's not a world I think he understands . And the result is a cartoonish , exaggerated shoot-em-up in which every character is lined up for the sole purpose of eventually being gunned down .
In love with pussy	Tom is playing with Jerry ( not that Jerry is having fun ) by dropping him in a spherical glass vase and watching him struggle to climb out . When Mammy-Two-Shoes ( dubbed to be less-offensive in my version ) answers the door , Tom chucks Jerry into a filing cabinet under ' M ' and spies on what the big deal is . Mammy-Two-Shoes has agreed to look after a neighbor's kitty while they're gone for the day . It just so happens to be a female kitty that Tom falls instantly in love with . He tries everything to impress her , only for her to respond with a bewildered expression . Finally he pulls Jerry out of the filing cabinet in an attempt to show off the tricks they've practiced together . Jerry , not to pleased with this , turns the tables on Tom and makes an idiot out of him . And Jerry is the one who ends up getting the girl . Not too funny , but not too boring . Lacks bite .
A mild adventure comedy	It takes a lot to get around the alarmingly 80's Edinburgh featured in this movie . A lot has changed since then and since the movie is about 2 guys who are bored with their lives , the city scenes are shot in the most drab and depressing way possible . This only accentuates their adventures in the countryside . Basically Ronnie and Will are on the edge . They hate their lives so much and decide that a little highway robbery in the highlands would be just the fun they are looking for . What begins as a little fun soon leads to them becoming local heroes and , by the end , immortal legends . With good characters , some funny scenes and a nice feel-good factor towards the end , Restless Natives makes for easily diverting entertainment . It's long , long out of print and ancient VHS ex-rental copies go for £135 at online auction sites . I think a DVD release is rather overdue . I hope it comes in widescreen when it does . I am unsure or the original aspect ratio but the copy I saw was in pan and scan and the lack of wide shot in the countryside scenes felt awkward and disorientating . The mangled Glaswegian accents did NOT fit the Edinburgh setting though .
Good ideas , okay execution	But oh Lordy was the dialogue bad . I mean very , very , very bad . Bad to the point that my cousin my girlfriend and me almost walked out . Also it took quite while for anything to happen . But when it did it was kind of worth it . And being a comic book fan myself I appreciated it more than most . I think it was a good idea for pretentious director of several undeserving blockbusters . M . Night Shyamalan to film this movie in widescreen . As you probably know from my other reviews , I hate flat photography . The Sixth Sense was made this way and I found it very irritating as the story deserved some scope . Also , this film was way better than Sixth Sense and I found the twist to be more wholesome and pleasing . The kid who plays Willis ' son looked uncannily like Haley Joel Osment and Samuel L . Jackson made a BIG mistake with the afro . But his performance was still good . It's good to see that actors and directors take comic books seriously as authentic literature rather than classifying them as ' geeky ' things . For that I like the movie despite the abominable dialogue .
Obvious and straight-forward , but there's a lesson in here to be learned	I hate tabloid press as much as the next person . But I will be honest to you about how I feel about movie stars . It is a dishonest profession . I don't believe in actors getting paid $20 million for a single film and living in multiple mansions when harder working folks get nothing . But then you have to consider what the character of Bo Laramie says in this film . Perhaps every time someone takes your picture you lose a bit of your soul . Maybe the constant hassling of the press is only worth $20 million . Celebrities do rub it in our faces a bit too much about how much money they have . We are the ones that see their movies and buy their CDs . It's because of us that they have what they have right ? And when we want a little bit of them back , when we want a little insight into their lives that ultimately , we , have helped create for them , they often bite back with attitude . There is a line that is not to be crossed though . The odd picture here and there is more than enough . But as there are so many , many tabloid magazines out there , all with the same kind of single-word single-syllable title , the business has become very diluted and all of them are willing to buy the most mundane photos of celebs doing uninteresting things . Not only this , but they take it to rather perverted extremes and it baffles me that anyone could be at all interested in it . I've seen long-shots of celebs hanging around like any person ought to but with massive close-ups of sweaty armpits , circled for the benefit of anyone not enlightened to the point of the picture . Morbid close-ups of some celebrity's blouse revealing some milkshake she spilled a few hours earlier is just plain creepy . Sadly , there are thousands of parasites out there who are willing to fork over their hard-earned cash for such rags . I'll never understand the fascination . Celebs are made out to be Gods of some kind . Something we all want to be but never can . Their teeth are perfect , their wives / husbands beautiful , their children beautiful , their homes are palaces and their lifestyles enviable . Most of us live our whole lives in jealousy of celebs . This is why we just want a little bit more back from them . They can afford it right ? With all that money and ' power ' a few pics here and there won't hurt will they ? Well , I can't imagine myself liking it very much . And , considering the crap I've seen some celebs take , I personally don't think any of it's worth $20 million . Punching a Paparazzo in the face with my fist going through his camera first sounds like the best image of all in my opinion . Since a union of celebs is actually quite powerful , I do believe their wills be much , much tighter laws in the near future to curb Paparazzi . There's always some story of some actor taking a weaselly photographer to court . Or you could do it the way Bo Laramie does . Laramie ( Cole Hauser ) is a former Montana carpenter who has , by pure chance , become a star in Hollywood through various xXx-style action movies . The public loves him and wants more than he is willing to offer . His private life is constantly being invaded by those peeking in . But they are taking pictures too . Rex Harper ( the very cool , but sadly self-destructive , Tom Sizemore ) is one of those pesky photographers . And Laramie doesn't take too kindly to Harper taking pics of his son playing football . He responds by punching out Harper , only a group of his Paparazzi pals ( including Danny-the best Baldwin , the psycho killer from Heat , and some highly annoying English guy you can't wait to see hanging from a tree ) catch the whole thing on film and whore out their footage to the highest bidder . Now with a personal vendetta between them a childish game is promptly brought to an end ( or only just beginning ) when they involve Laramie and his family in a Princess Diana-style car wreck . And instead of calling an ambulance , they take pictures of their bloody bodies . Sadly , it's not sounding far-fetched yet . Having not learned from other's mistake Laramie is still hassled by the photographers and press and they continue to fabricate stories and bend ( read utterly distort ) the truth to line their own pockets . Little do they know Laramie is planning a Punisher-style revenge on the 4 dolts responsible for his tragedy . Click on my reviews to find a coninuation of this criticism in another film of the same name as the IMDb only allows 1000 words .
Riveting	Where do I get these jokes from ? Man , I crack myself up . I've been waiting all day to do that one . In this cartoon an apparently unemployed Donald is wandering around town singing the High-Ho song from Snow White . He comes upon a construction site and applies for the job of Riveter despite obviously having no experience in this field . Much to his distress he begins his day of labor at the top of a zillion-foot high skyscraper ( though the elevator only ascends 1 floor ! ) and his boss is an easily irritated man . Disaster follows as per usual but at least this one ends with Donald getting the upper hand on his beastly boss .
Go fish !	Tom sneaks into a secluded area for some fish poaching . The lake is guarded by Spike , but Tom has his same old tricks for taking care of him . In his bait box he has a captured Jerry , who he promptly disguises as a worm and casts into the lake . Some horrible sort of Gator / Fish creature pops up and decides he'd really like to get a bite of Jerry , but he'll be damned if he's gonna let Tom catch him . There are a couple of funny moments in this cartoon but it's mostly just generic stuff and recycled gags . The ending isn't really up to much either , it's all just plain uninspired .
An interesting , if failed , TV pilot	I love Bubsy the Bobcat . He's so cute and funny . His video game was loads of fun and I thought he had major potential to be a big star ( and maybe still ) . Plus I loved his T-Shirt with the big red exclamation mark ! This TV pilot however was far too-dated for 1993 and didn't think ahead . The animation , music and characters were very late-80s in design and story line was too whacked-out with no internal logic . And while I love Bubsy's trademark ' What Can Possibly Go Wrong ? ' line it is used far too many times in this 30-minute episode . It would have been nice to see at least one or two seasons of Bubsy but all we're stuck with for now is this ancient pilot that's practically impossible to track down .
An entertaining , though weakly plotted sequel	First of all , let me just say that Kronk's New Groove is very , very funny with a good amount of laugh out loud moments . Surely that is all that matters then , eh ? Well , no . Compared to the first film , the story is pretty tepid . All of the previous characters return . Of course there is Kronk himself , along with Kuzco , Pacha and his family , the babbling squirrel and Yzma ( who has now turned mostly back into a ' human ' but still features a cat's tail and feline abilities . The movie tries to incorporate all of them into the story but nothing really sticks . It all just seems like an excuse for mayhem . As before , it is told in flashback with Kronk explaining how he ended up in such sorry circumstances . His dad is coming to visit him and he's afraid of the inevitable disapproval he'll get as all he's managed to do with his life is be a Junior Chipmunk Troup Leader and run a restaurant kitchen . His dad thinks that cooking and talking to animals isn't a ' real job ' and won't give Kronk the big thumbs up until he's got his own house on a hill with loads of money . From this thin idea comes loads of deception , scheming and hijinks . And that's basically the movie . It IS packed full of hilarious moments and wonderful Looney Tunes-inspired humor like the first , but it just lacks that overall high-quality . Still , it's loads of fun and any fan of The Emperor's New Groove must give it a rent .
A fun , disposable sci-fi flick	I'm not a fan of Vin Diesel . His ego has inflated to a size his talent cannot match . He's better off in smaller movies and in smaller roles . I refuse to watch utter crap like xXx or A Man Apart but he's better than average in Pitch Black . He plays Richard B . Riddick , a convict for massive , infinite crimes that are never defined in the slightest way . This was probably done to add mystery but I say it's bad writing . He's being transported on a spaceship on his way to spacejail but the ship crashes on a desert planet ( as the original series of Star Trek proved , most planets are deserts ) and he escapes . But hold on , the planet is just entering an extended eclipse that only happens every 22 years . And when pitch blackness falls upon the nameless rock zillions of hungry bat-type thingies come out of hibernation to gobble-up whoever they can . So guess who the motely crew of survivors call on to help them . Most of the film is simply going through the motions of killing the characters off one by one and it's nothing new . Sure it distracts one's attention for 110 minutes but it's nothing new or astonishing . The best thing about the film is the presence of Keith David . Let's be honest , the man is 10 different kinds of cool . And he acts Mr Silly Voice off the screen very easily . The DVD is in 2 . 35 : 1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby / DTS 5 . 1 sound and a bunch of extras I simply do not care about .
Worthwhile	I liked this movie and I was glad I spent the money on it but the direction was awful . Christian Duguay tries so hard to inject flair and coolness into the movie but fails badly . Filters and rain do not make for flashy and original direction , it's been done a hundred times before . Also , the constant rain adds a REALLY depressing mood to the film . If you're upset or want to escape from reality it's not a good idea to see this movie . Wesley Snipes is very good in his role . He always is , he is probably the most versatile actor out there . The way he can be cool without being over-confident or is refreshing . I hate seeing arrogant actors show off ( Nic Cage and John Travolta in Face / Off done my head in ) and ruin the movie . Five minutes into this film you will know who the bad guy is . No director will ever have Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa as a good guy . Although he always is a great villain , smooth and smart , it's no big secret as soon as you see him . But he was half the reason that I saw the film . You can always be guaranteed a quintessential villain when he plays the part . The action was quite cool . The scene with the car driving into the diner was impressive . It was my favourite scene . The huge leap of the skyscraper was eye pleasing , it was a great opening to the movie . It may be better than most other junk that's out in the theatre but the direction lets it down big time . But it's worth it for the hero and villain and the action . See it for yourself .
It's ' Philosopher's Stone ' !	I'm not really a big fan of the HP films . I don't think that they translate well from the books as they are often quite long and need severe cutting down in order to fit into a 2 hour + film . This has been increasingly evident in the later HP sequels , but Philosopher's Stone seems to be pretty much all intact . I do find Chris Columbus ' mostly naturalized approach to shooting the film to be the most appropriate . In GOF , Mike Newell had the cheap and uncheerful logic of shooting everything with a heavy green filter to make it look ' mysterious ' and ' magical ' . I think it just looks stupid and that the far-fetched fantasy nature is more identifiable if shot more ordinarily . What does bug me about this film and always surprises me on repeat viewings , is how horrible the entire kiddie cast are at acting . Check out the terrible performance from the guy who plays the blandly named Oliver Wood ! Woof ! It's like watching some rubbish Primary School play with big budget visual effects . It takes me out of the movie every time . The 150-minute running time seems to pass by in a breeze , something I've never really felt with the sequels . But something that bugs me is even right here at the beginning Dumbledore seems to be like ' I'll tell you about it when you're older , Harry . ' Which is a cheap hook to make us read / watch the later installments . I don't really have that much to say about Philosopher's Stone , which is why my review is short and spiceless . It's a shame the sequels had to be so boring . Stick with the books , a couple are overwritten but they are superior to the films . A clichéd thing to say , but still true .
It's fun to smash things !	Grand Theft Simpsons is a great idea . But the execution is not in regards to this game . It may look wonderful but the graphics are not without their annoying flaws and while the voice cast may be great the initial hilarity quickly gives way to tedium . Simpsons : Hit and Run is an average game . It has a lot of coolness to it but also a lot of crappiness that severely cripples enjoyment . Pros : - Zillions of in jokes - It's incredibly cute - Some nice moments in the music-Some of the levels look simply gorgeous - The levels are big enough without being too big and there's lots to explore . - The cut-scenes are brilliant ! - It's got a better plot than the lame , tired TV show has had in years . Cons : - Not enough ways to make money - Money is all too easily taken from you-Many cool things are available to buy but there isn't enough money in the level to buy them - All missions are timed and involve collecting things - Traffic jams occur faaaar too easily and they are very , very hard to get out of - Wherever you want to go , a hundred cars will be blocking your way - Many kinds of car are available , but they're all crap - Certain cars are required for certain missions but for no real reason - When the Police are after you it's almost impossible to get away - The police will come after you too quickly and easily - Whenever you desperately need a car there won't be one for miles - Many , MANY opportunities for amazing stunts are ignored , most of the time the game will simple fade out and then back in rather than show a cool crash-There's not really that much interaction with the environment - There is no proper mapping system - The camera often gets stuck - Since when was Springfield a vast metropolis ? I'll admit that I simply gave up on this game , it's just absolutely IN-FUR-I-ATING . I wanted to crush the controls with my hand and smash in my TV screen in uncontrollable , blind , ugly rage . THAT is what this game will do to you . The poor programming and unfair disadvantages will drive you crazy . If this is the kind of game you like ( and why ? ) then go ahead . For the rest of us who rely on skill and strategy ( and not just luck ) in order to get through video games , we'll calmly put this game aside and move onto something else .
Enthusiastically , if slightly amateurishly , made horror hokum	" Keep away from Pumpkinhead , Unless you're tired of living , His enemies are mostly dead , He's mean and unforgiving , Bolted doors and windows barred , Guard dogs prowling in the yard , Won't protect you in your bed , Nothing will , from Pumpkinhead . " So goes the poem by Ed Justin . I've never heard of it previously . I'm assuming it's more of an American pop culture thing . Stan Winston may be the man behind many of todays horror icons and creatures but how exactly does he hold up as a director ? Not that great I'm afraid to say . But let's be reasonable . This film is almost 20 years old ( it was completed in 1987 ) and Winston has no doubt improved in many ways since . But what he lacks in style he makes up for in enthusiasm . The ever-brilliant Lance Henrikson ( the man with THE coolest voice in the world ) is Ed Harley , a backwoods shopkeep who's Milky-Bar Kid-lookalike son is killed by reckless dirt-bikers . After this surprising sad and touching scene , Ed visits the house of a mysterious old hag who has ties with the forces of darkness . Wishing vengeance upon the bikers he is sent on a mission to dig up the remains of a demon buried in a pumpkin patch . With his blood thrown into the mix of an evil spell , the demon is soon resurrected and goes about his usual mission of killing people who deserve it . And so begins a series of scenes you've seen many times in numerous Friday the 13th films and the subsequent rip-offs . Only instead of a masked killer you get a very tall , weird looking creature that looks a lot like the Xenomorph from the Alien series . Despite Winston's usually awkward framing and cutting , he does pull off a couple of good scares and generates a decent amount of atmosphere . But the constant unnatural lighting , floodlit woods and fog effects get a bit annoying . Pumpkinhead is , essentially , a tribute to urban legends and ancient scary stories told for generations before TV and mass-communication came along . In that sense , Pumpkinhead ranks alongside other mythical characters such as Spring-heeled Jack , the Skunk-Ape , Shadow People and El Chupacabra . Many of these characters are in the public subconscious , but like I said , perhaps the Pumkinhead myth is too uncommon outside of America to make that kind of impact . Plus , there is good amount of story going untold . The whole idea of Harley and Pumpkinhead being connected through blood and bloodlust isn't developed too well and the film should have had a stronger showdown between them . The mysterious old hag could have had a bigger part too . But if you're in the mood for undemanding horror , with slight irony , mild mythology , an interesting killer and one of the coolest actors ever ( Mr Henrikson , take a bow ) then go for it . Don't expect anything groundbreaking or memorable .
Pluto's Pal	The King of Siam ( or something ) sends Mickey little Bobo , a baby elephant , for a new pet ( he could have phoned ahead ) and a pal for Pluto . So Mickey get down to hard work building an Elephant kennel . Pluto's lil ' Devil on his shoulder ( er . . . where did the angel go ? ) tells him that the elephant is his replacement and to plot against him . Obviously Pluto cannot reads the innocence and friendliness in Bobo's eyes and relentlessly tries to run Bobo off . He just won't give in to his devil's side . Would this be allowed in the disgustingly PC world of Disney today . NO ! A mildly amusing cartoon .
Potentially brilliant if it weren't for that stupid , stupid plot	There's a lot to like about Justice League : The New Frontier , but I'm afraid all of that is counterbalanced by one of the silliest stories I've ever seen in animation . Set mostly in the 50s and featuring the DC hero fashion of that period the paranoid US government have blackballed all superheroes , claiming that they have something to hide beside their identities and dismiss them as Commies . The Flash is even ridiculed because of his RED costume . But soon they will have to come together again to fight a common enemy when ( and I'm not kidding ) a large floating , living island of dinosaurs called The Center plans to wipe out humanity . I've read hundreds of comic books in my life and that is seriously the dumbest crap I have ever heard . Every other part of JL : TNF is far superior to this ' Center ' nonsense , so it's such a shame that the main plot drags it down . I especially like the story about the Martian Manhunter and the Flash . Most of the JLA get a look-in but these two have the most substantial plots . The animation style will be familiar to those who are fans of Warner / DC cartoons such as Batman and the 50s production design creates a nice atmosphere . But that idiotic plot . . .
Goodnight , Sir .	The nefarious ( I've no idea what that means , but I know it works ) super-assassin Francisco Saramanga is out to kill Bond . Because he's like that . Scaramanga charges a million dollars a hit and is the only person in the world who has a slim chance of getting to Bond . Concerned for his safety , M takes Bond off active duty . Never perturbed ( not really sure of that word either ) , Bond still investigates and soon discovers that Scaramanga has stolen the ' priceless ' Solex Agitator . Oh yeah , one of those ! A mere MacGuffin and no more . In his mission to retrieve said ' agitator ' Bond travels to Thailand and Hong Kong and gets into many silly fights , one involving a midget butler . He even finds time stress-out hillbilly Sheriff JW Pepper once more and . . . erm . . . ' roger ' his gorgeous assistant Mary Goodnight . It's very dumb and thoroughly unsophisticated but it's all in the name of fun and Roger Moore's light , somewhat innocent way of playing Bond just keeps you smiling all the way through . I also liked John Barry's score , despite the fact he claims it's his weakest effort on the series . TMWTGG was the last Bond film to be shot in a 1 . 85 : 1 aspect ratio and I do feel that if it was shot in Panavision then it would have more slick and polished look . 33 years on , TMWTGG looks too grainy and dated and appears older than it is . I'm not sure why Guy Hamilton chose to film it this way when 4 previous Bond films had already been made in Scope widescreen . Definitely one of the lesser Bond movies but saved by sense of humor and never-ending fun . Rent this one .
Keep it down !	Spike is stressed out and in need of a good sleep . Which is kind of hard to do when Tom is chasing Jerry , blasting at him with a shotgun and trampling over poor Spike . Threatened with silence or death , Tom backs off , but has to deal with Jerry running around deliberately making noise . This short won an Academy Award back in 1945 , but I wouldn't really say that's THAT funny . For a T & J cartoon it's pretty much in the middle . Yes , there are laughs but not Oscar material laughs and it's not too inventive . There is actually some dialogue too , further proving the awful 1992 movie wrong , but no one is credited for providing the voices .
Cats : The Original Musical	Mammy-Two-Shoes ( dubbed to sound less ' racist ' to appease the narrow-minded PC brigade in the version that I saw ) goes out for the night , leaving Tom alone with the house to himself . He immediately invites a bunch of alley cats around for a party , causing no end of disturbance to Jerry , who doesn't take kindly to their music . After attempts at silencing them fail , Jerry is tortured and tied up , but he still has enough in him to call Mammy-Two-Shoes ( the number he dials is nothing but 1-1-1-1-1 ) and get Tom in trouble . It's an average cartoon , which nothing to make it really stand out above the rest with the exception of two frames in which you actually get to see Mammy-Two-Shoes ' face . Otherwise ; bland .
Danger First	It's Independence Day , and Jerry's nephew Nibbles is determined to get himself blown up by playing around with all kinds of fireworks , leading to Jerry getting blasted every time . Tom appears and torments the mice , and a war breaks out between them leading to the usual tricks , chases and fights . Safety Seconds repeats a lot of jokes from previous cartoons and is treading water for most of the running time . One thing I don't get is why Nibbles wears a diaper . I mean , neither he nor Jerry are toilet trained and mice just defecate wherever they please . So surely it would be more hygienic for Nibbles to do just that rather than going around with it all mashed-up between his butt cheeks . An average cartoon regardless .
We're doing our part with all our heart , heigh-ho !	For fans of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs this'll be a truly bizarre experience to see them promoting war . . . bonds . This short was made with funding from the Canadian Government to encourage citizens to buy war dollars to help with Canada's involvement in WWII . It begins with the dwarfs digging for diamonds in their mine singing an alternate , propaganda themed version of their heigh-ho song . After digging they take the diamonds to the local bank to buy war dollars . It's at this point that the hugely unsubtle propaganda kicks in . BUY WAR DOLLARS ! DO YOUR PART ! HELP US WIN THE WAR ! It's weird watching this . It's not something you'd get on the Disney channel . More like the History channel . And at four minutes it's not very long either .
If you take this seriously then you're totally missing the point !	A Low Down Dirty Shame is really no more than all the most familiar Cop movie clichés arranged in an order that makes a barely cohesive story . But it's all the fun and silly action that occurs in between that really matters ! It's a bit like The Last Boy Scout from a spoof-blaxploitation angle . Shame ( Keenan Ivory Wayans ) is a former cop who has been blackballed after a major drugs bust went awry , leaving several DEA agents dead . He now works as a private detective , taking on suicide missions for peanuts and barely scraping by . His disapproving secretary Peaches ( a very funny and very , very small Jada Pinkett ) wants him to get his act together but he's too busy wallowing in self-pity . His old pal from the DEA shows up and offers him a side mission to help get back at the Drug Kingpin who ruined his career . And so , with only a few clues , Shame begins his search and soon all roads lead to lies and deception . Like I said , the plot is certainly nothing special . But it does contain a helluva lot of laughs and decent action . The one thing I can complain of is that the production design is kind of dated now . Action films have evolved so much in the past decade that watching ALDDS 12 years on can be a bit distracting . Wayans ( who also directs as well as writing and starring ) too often shoots non-actions scenes like a sitcom and his light-hearted editing may help remind you that this totally AIN'T a serious film but it's a little TV-ish if you know what I mean . If you find ALDDS for cheap somewhere or if it's showing on TV then don't con yourself out of a fun movie . High art is not what this film aims to be .
Better than Big	For some reason people hold Tom Hanks ' BIG in high regard . I did not find it funny one little bit . And the supposed irony of him growing up to play with toys for a job annoyed me even when I was 8 years old . I knew adult life wasn't like that . For all of it's ridiculousness , 13 going on 30 is much better . Plus it's more of a time travel movie than body-morph . It examines who we are as kids and how we end up as adults . It deals with relationships and lost innocence . Something far more interesting and relevant than anything BIG ever did . Plus Jennifer Garner is more easy on the eye than Tom Hanks . I wasn't keen on Mark Ruffalo being in this ( I will NEVER forgive his moustache in IN THE CUT ) but his character was ( intentionaly ) blank and emotionless enough for his performance to be unintrusive and he did a good job with it . It's difficult to care for a statue . The Gollum guy playing Jennifer's boss was pretty much stereotyped and none of the other characters had much depth . There was no reason to get involved when you know their problems will become undone by the time-travel plot . A nice way to spend a rainy afternoon . Just don't expect to remember it five minutes after it's finished . The DVD is in 1 . 85 : 1 anamorphic widescreen with unengaging Dolby 5 . 1 sound and a bunch of extras I care not for .
Not falling for it .	T & J are chasing right from the beginning in this one and Tom is having his usual no luck on catching him . This time he decides to call an exterminator company , hoping that they might have some more elaborate traps handy that Tom could never dream of . They send a cat to catch the mouse ( naturally ) but , like Tom before him , Jerry his just not falling for his game of death and turns the tables on them . It's absolutely nothing fancy but the visual humor and imagination make it funny . You can tell how it's going to end but you never really expect Jerry to end up dead do you ? There is also dialogue in this cartoon but no one is credited for it .
Interesting story of pointless bigotry and hatred	I remember seeing this movie back in high school in RE ( that's Religious Education for you folks who didn't have the ' privilage ' of going to a strict Catholic Fundamentalist school ) and thinking it was a pretty good movie . Despite the fact that we were 14 and the film is rated 18 over here in the UK , which was totally illegal and would never be allowed now . The other thing I remember was Trevor Jones ' really cool-sounding Ry Cooder inspired score . Since this film was loosely based on the 1964 killings of 3 Civil Rights activists , one of whom only got sentenced a few days ago , 40 years after the crime , I thought it would be appropriate to check the film out again . It's got a good story and is well acted , especially by Hackman , who is one of my fave actors ( Dafoe is too but he's not in much these days ) . They play two FBI Agents , who don't get on ( a popular cliché at the time ) , down in a backwoods southern town looking for three kids who have probably been killed by evil KKK members . The villains are despicable and Brad Dourif once again uses his wild eyes to great effect . But I was a little disappointed that none of them really got what they deserved ( even though in real life it took 40 years to get justice ) and got let-off with minor sentences , none of them over 10 years for the brutal killing of three people and all the mass-destruction and arson they did . I was let-down by the ending and really wanted more red-neck , dirt-faced , hicka-billies getting their heads kicked in . And , judging from the recent televised court-case , attitude towards African-American's hasn't changed much since then . Which is pathetic .
Pretty good sequel	This film opens with tremendous confidence and energy . The humor of the Turtles may be so 1990 but I still dig it . The opening scene in the shopping mall is way funny and a great way to introduce is to the sequel . At the time the style of the Turtles wasn't so stale , so the plot may seem a bit childish or dumb now . I have no doubts that if this movie were made today it would not be subtitled ' The Secret of the Ooze ' . One can hardly expect high art from a movie called Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II but they could have subtitled it something a little less crass . Apparently taking place right after the first movie ( where's Casey ) it wastes no time bringing back the Shredder and the rest of the Foot Clan . This time Shredder aims to steal the cannister of ooze that mutated our heroes so he can make his own monsters to avenge his defeat . The result is Tokka and Rahzar and it seems like a half-attempt at a live-action version of Rocksteady and Bebop . As you can imagine , this plot isn't very clever . But the movie never really lulls so long as our heroes are on screen . Look out for a cameo by Vanilla Ice ( looking alarmingly like Dolph Lundgren ) at the end . It's so dated it may be difficult to watch but as long as your alone you won't have to cringe . The DVD has wonderful motion menus as well as a great 1 . 85 : 1 anamorphic picture with Dolby 5 . 1 sound . Extras are thin but still it's a great buy .
They're back , they're bad . He's black , he's mad .	The topical plot of Lethal Weapon 2 may seem a little dated now , but Soud Av-ree-gan villains are always despicable and who doesn't love to them get blown away . In this second installment in the LW series , Riggs and Murtaugh babysit FBI witness Leo Getz ( a wimpy , eager to be friends Joe Pesci ) , much to their displeasure . Stuck with nothing much to do , they decide to investigate the criminals Leo is testifying against-a rude lot of Soud Av-ree-gan diplomats with immunity to commit as many crimes as they want . Riggs also takes a fancy to their secretary Rika ( Patsy Kensit ) , but obviously their romance isn't going to last . She might as well have a death-clock counting down on her forehead . Richard Donner seems more involved in making LW2 a better film than the original . This time he shoots in Panavision ( why he didn't do this first time around I don't know ) , allows more time for character development and tries hard to make a political message out of the South African Apartheid situation . Even in his previous film Scrooged , which came out a year earlier , he had anti-apartheid messages . And , if you're really sad like me , you'll notice that Riggs and Rika bang their heads together when they first meet in the exact same way that Frank Cross and Claire Phillips do in Scrooged . And his then pro-NRA posters are still hanging around in the background . Donner later reversed his opinion on this organisation . I always felt that the original Lethal Weapon was far too plain and straight-forward . It lacked spark in every way , but LW2 introduces more characters , has more sophisticated action and a better plot . Michael Kamen however pretty much cuts and pastes his score from the first and even rips-off his own Die Hard score in a couple of cues . This got worse in LW3 . The ending could have killed the series off had Riggs died , which is what Shane Black originally intended . We would have been spared the awful LW3 had this been so . But instead Riggs manages to fight off death and stay alive in Murtaughs arms despite being shot about 86 times . A nice touch having Bob Dylan's " Knockin ' On Heaven's Door " playing over his potential last moments alive though . After this the series became too comical and diluted . They SHOULD have killed him .
Stay out of trouble !	RoboCop could have been the start of a great franchise . Instead the brand name piffled-out after the sequel and has since languished in the hell of TV shows , animated TV shows and mini-series crap . Paul Verhoeven's multi-layered original provided a platform for so much potential and possibility , it's a shame we only got 2 good movies out of it . Alex Murphy is a deeply unlucky cop who has transferred into Detroit's ( actually Dallas ) worst precinct . On his first day on the job he is gunned down by the stupendously evil Clarence Boddicker ( a brilliant turn by Kurtwood Smith ) and his gang of nasty thugs . Resurrected as some kind of Frankenstien / Christ figure , Murphy returns as RoboCop-The Future of Law Enforcement . In the world of RoboCop big business rules and public servants can be bought as stock ( doesn't sound so unrealistic does it ? ) . A super-conglomerate called Omni Consumer Products has entered into an agreement to fund and run the Detroit Police Force . Wishing to create a cop who doesn't need to eat or sleep they have a choice of pursuing the RoboCop idea or going with Vice President , Dick Jones ' idea of ED-209 , a mech-like twin cannon on legs . The CEO goes with RoboCop , leaving Jones with a personal vendetta against poor Robo . It may have been satire back in 1987 but today we are all to used to doomsday news being delivered by smile by our news anchors only to cut to an ad feature some violent video game or movie . The violence , social commentary and horror of RoboCop can sometimes pale in comparison to real life . When you're 7 years old , RoboCop is probably just the most amazing thing ever . I swear , I must have seen this film about 100 times when I was a kid . I was word-perfect on it . Even erm . . . note-perfect on Basil Poledouris ' awesome , awesome score . I guess it's kind of unfair on kids these days that they are raised on braindead PG-13 crap while I got one bloody action movie after another back in the 80s . RoboCop is no doubt a classic . It's a shame it had such an indignant death . Still , I guess this is still a chance for re-resurrection . But please . . . no remake !
The World Is Not Enough .	Always the underdog and never the Top Dog , OHMSS has a bad reputation that it doesn't deserve . I honestly don't know what Bond fans really want in their movies as they hate anything that has too many gadgets and set pieces ( like the uber-crap Die Another Day ) and turn their nose up at anything that represents Ian Fleming's true vision of Bond . Lazenby , like Daniel Craig , suffered a press backlash before the film was released that swayed public opinion against OHMSS . Fortunately this was not the case with the more recent Casino Royale but this entry also deserves the same regard . The story has Bond taken off the Blofeld case after failing to apprehend him twice and sent on a 2-week holiday . He soon falls in love with Contessa Tracy Di Vicenzo who's daddy is the boss of one of Europe's largest crime syndicates . Daddy , has a deal for Bond . Make his daughter happy and he'll point him in the direction of the elusive Blofeld and give him a £1 , 000 , 000 bonus . An offer he can't refuse huh ? It turns out that Blofeld ( Television Savalas , the best incarnation of the character ) is hiding in the Swiss Alps and Bond goes undercover as Geneology expert Sir Hilary Bray to smoke him out . Bond just happens to be a bit of a Geneologist himself ( this movie has him discover that the Bond family motto is ' Orbis Non Sufficit ' . . . interesting ) and reckons he bluff his way through it . Blofeld's world conquering plot this time around is kinda Austin Powers-ish but it's thankfully played down . Bond , stripped of his stupid gadgets , must rely on his cunning and wits to outsmart Blofeld and defeat his evil schemes . I particularly like the scene where Bond is locked in a cable-car gear-room and his attempts to escape . Despite the obvious rear-projection a ski-chase , car chase and bobsleigh chase are all very well done . John Barry's score is also noteworthy and his main OHMSS theme is brilliant . If there was ever anything that could come close to replacing the signature Bond theme while still retaining that familiar sound then this is it . Hunt it down , check it out . The scope cinematography is also a standout and often has some nice , atmospheric shots . Something not often seen in a Bond film . I first saw OHMSS when I was a kid and I remember reading about how it was a flop when it was released in theatres . Which is actually a total lie , it DIDN'T flop . The mediocre review in the horrid tabloid newspaper I read made me , as a 10-year-old , dislike the the film . I don't feel that way now though . And despite remembering how it ended I was still pretty shocked when it came . It's far more dramatic and memorable than typical Bond endings . Is this what turns most people off OHMSS ? Who the hell wants same-old same-old ? Yes , there are a few continuity problems , such as Bond and Blofeld not recognizing each other but since their only face-to-face was with Connery and Donald Pleasance ( the most parodied Bond villain performance ) it would be absurd for Lazenby and Savalas to be familiar with each other . Too bad Lazenby didn't come back for Diamonds Are Forever . It would have been better for him to be given a nice little double-feature instead of Connery returning one last time . The youngest Bond actor ( he was 29 at the time of filming ) , he certainly looked athletic and believable but apparently his youthful cockiness onset ruffled the producers feathers too much and his own doubts in the series and himself as an actor prevented his return . Don't let the ancient bad rep put you off . OHMSS is just as worthy as another other superior Bond film .
Where's Jerry ?	The cat and mouse are involved in the usual chases when Jerry dives into a bottle of invisible ink and discovers that it makes him vanish . Instead of seizing the opportunity to go spy on a girl mouse changing room or something , he uses his new-found invisibility to torment Tom . And it's pretty funny and quite inventive despite being a somewhat one-joke cartoon . And the action never leaves the interior of the house , which is usually the trait of below average T & J shorts . Still worth a . However , I'm not sure how an invisible mouse can cast a shadow on the wall , it defies physics and the very nature of being invisible itself .
The first , of many clones .	I'll be totally honest . I was never a big fan of Pepe Le Pew . Every one of his cartoons is the same . For some silly reason a cat will end up a white stripe on it's back and Pepe , a smelly skunk , falls in love with her . His foul scent is so strong that when he grabs her and unleashes an endless barrage of kisses , she can only become like butter in his arms with a dazed look on her face . Occasionally she will try to escape and Pepe will fob it off with something like ' You are play-eeng hard-to-geet ' . Blah , blah , blah , they are all the same . Grant , this one was the first and it won an Oscar . But that was probably the reason they made so many more . This one does have a funny twist at the end when Pepe's love falls into a barrel of water and emerges like crack-addicted rat and the tables are turned . But it's still not really THAT funny . Pepe was only ever a supporting character and never strong enough to carry a whole cartoon . He IS very cute though .
Miles better than the 2006 disaster !	I had only ever seen the TV version of the original Superman movie until I bought the HD-DVD . So , as you can imagine , on TV it was in hideous pan and scan and with several scenes missing . In reality , I have never seen the ' full ' movie until now . And I have to admit , it's far , far superior to Bryan Singer's self-indulgent mess of Superman Returns . It actually takes quite a while to get going , but there's so much going on that the running time certainly doesn't seem two and a half hours . Richard Donner shot it back to back with Superman II , so there's an extended opening act that establishes the plot of the sequel at the same time . Anyone who doesn't know the story of Superman must be from another galaxy , but for those people I will give you a quick soundbite . Kal El is the orphan of the planet Krypton , which has recently blown up . He comes to Earth as a baby and lands in Smallville where he is quickly adopted by a farmer and his wife and renamed Clark Kent . His dense molecular structure and his ability to defy Earth's gravity give him advantages over humans and ultimately he becomes . . . SUPERMAN ! But who doesn't already know that ? Clark Kent assumes an exaggerated , clumsy , meek newspaper reporter persona to distance himself from the Superman guise . Somehow everybody , including secret love Lois Lane , falls for it even though the glasses and the hair are all that is different . Hypervillain Lex Luthor ( Gene Hackman ) doesn't take well to the man of steel as he might interfere with his plans for Real Estate Domination ( the modern term for World Domination ) . But does he really think he can win ? Hypervillains never know when to be humble . Just about everything that was terrible about Superman Returns is completely right about this one . The cinematography , the music , the editing , the pacing . I won't call the SFX fake , since it doesn't ever take you out of the film , so I'll just call them ' quaint ' . For 1978 they're good and even though they are all done optically it's still better than the CGI crapfest of Singer's interpretation . Christopher Reeve's ultimate fate does kind of upset me , so it's good to see him in his prime and being made immortal in a way . The cast of this film does have a lot of big names . Along with the huge scope and spectacle , such a large cast adds to the epic feel of it . Marlon Brando , Gene Hackman , Ned Beatty , Margot Kidder , Terence Stamp and Glenn Ford just seem like a far more dynamic bunch of actors than Kate Bosworth and Kal Penn . Don't you think ? It's been 29 years since this film was released and people still make a big fuss over it today . In 29 years , will be still be talking about Superman Returns ? Outside of ridicule , I think not .
Oh , what to do .	If there is anyone out there who read the comic book ' Beezer ' as a kid then you will be familiar with ' The Knumbskulls ' . A strip about a guy with little dudes living in him that control what he does . This short uses the same device to make an important , kind of subtle , point to us . Some guy , starting out as a baby , sometimes follows his emotions and at other times sense . Just like everyone else . He sees a woman he likes on the street and follows his emotions . It ends up a slap in the face , but her common sense reacted , not her emotions , which said ' yes ' . The point of this is that Hitler used emotions to keep the Nazi's brainwashed . None of them used common sense to figure out that he was a lunatic . But perhaps today we should still use our common sense to not believe rubbish published in tabloids or biased news stations . The logic applies to many things , not just Hitler's Nazi regime .
Stay Cool , Scooby-Doo !	Shaggy and Scooby get on the wrong plane when en route to meet the rest of the Mystery Inc . gang in Paris and end up lost in the Himalayas while an abdominal snowman is on the loose . There is the usual amount of suspects and motives but it's just fresh enough to prevent the plot from becoming tiresome . The animation just gets better and better with each entry in the Scooby-Doo series and the bright colors and active sound design are a long way from the grainy TV show back in 1969 ( though that still has its charm ) . Fans of the series will be glad to hear that the character of Dell Chillman from the Loch Ness adventure returns for this one , giving some continuity to the otherwise unrelated mysteries . I must admit that I preferred it when the monsters ended up being real but I guess that each mystery has its own logic and you'll be surprised at who is behind the mask of the adorable snowman . Keep ' em coming , Warner . That ol ' Great Dane could live to a hundred .
One of the most fun games on the Commodore 64	Out around the same time as the first Tim Burton movie this Batman game wasn't about the Dark Knight but the Caped Crusader . It resembled the campy 60s show and the more colorful comic-books but it was still a lot of fun to play . The comic-book panel representation of the graphics was brilliant and the ' Dizzy ' style puzzle solving elements quite engaging . What let the game down slightly was the beat-em-up element because you could never totally kill the baddies ( Batman doesn't do that ) and they'd just keep coming back for you , even when you kicked them off a roof . The tough edge of Batman doesn't really come through where as the detective side to him does . The game was actually 2 separate games on either side of the tape ( remember loading tapes ? ) with the Joker story on one side and the Penguin story on the other . Both were as good as each other and it was fun to alternate between them . Definitely one to check out . Graphics B Sound B Gameplay Lasting Appeal
. . . we sleep .	Almost every John Carpenter flick is cult , or underrated , or a sleeper . It seems that audiences never truly " get " his films until long after their release . Only now are people warming slightly to Escape From L . A . They Live is no exception . It takes forever to get going and has hardly any dialogue . But remember , I'm talking from the angle of someone who lives in an era where there is always an explosion in the first ten minutes , just to interest the audience . Taken from a short story , Eight O'Clock In The Morning , the film focuses on John Nada ( Roddy Piper ) , a drifter , who comes to L . A . in search of work . After scrounging a job at a construction site , he stays in a shantytown , run by Gilbert ( Peter Jason ) , and becomes friendly with Frank ( Keith David ) . After a while , he reckons that Gilbert is up to no good , as he is always disappearing into the gospel church across the street , and is reluctant to spill the beans too easily . Nada gets the feeling that something's not quite right . And so do we . Only we can't figure out what . Then the fuzz show up and lay waste to the shantytown . Nada just stands there and watches , looking totally confused . Next day , he raids the church , only to find boxes of sunglasses . He swipes one and when he wears it , not only does he see in black-and-white , but the world isn't quite the same . Ads and billboards tell him to " Eat " , " Sleep " or " Marry And Reproduce " . Magazines say nothing but " No Independent Thought " and " Do Not Question Authority " . But , most distressingly , some humans do not look human in the least . They have big bulging eyes , with purple skull-heads . Naturally , Nada is freaked out . Everything rests on his shoulders . He hardly ever speaks , yet the story is told through his eyes . We know what he knows only by reaction and facial expression . It's a difficult role and yet Piper handles is pretty good . Although the dialogue is pure exposition , Carpenter never fully presents us , or Nada , with a threatening situation . Obviously , the non-humans are aliens . But , like the tagline says , who are they , and what do they want ? It seems like they want to rule the world and exploit the working class , but that's the way things are anyhow . Apparently , they lead ordinary lives . If they weren't around , then someone would still be running the show , probably in the exact same way . It is because of this that Nada's sudden desire to go on an alien killing spree is too much to handle . Carpenter fails to make much of the movie after this . Meg Foster's character is almost totally irrelevant and extraneous . She serves no purpose . The prolonged fight scene between Nada and Frank is supposed to be funny , but simply isn't . It just feels odd and the comedy doesn't come through . I guess Carpenter let this scene go because Piper had a lot of wrestling experience and it might be a good idea to film a less fake-looking fight with him . Although Nada and Frank are friends , the reason for them to beat the crap out of each is stupid and not ironic at all . The ending is a bit abrupt , but the director has never been one for indulgence . It's a good ending though and it will make you laugh , which is fortunate , because you're hardly likely to smile much in the second half . Interesting , but not up to the standard of Carpenter's earlier work .
You must see this movie-film . . . so my country can be free .	Borat is sent to America with producer Azamat Bagatov to brush with American culture and help Kazakhstan move forward in the 21st Century . While there , he goes renegade and tries to hunt down Pamela Anderson for a quick marriage ( with his ' wedding sack ' ) after his wife Oksana is killed by a bear while walking his retarded brother Bilo . I will admit that this film is frequently hilarious , but it's not as good as I thought it could be . Sacha Baron Cohen recycles a lot of jokes and situations from the TV show . I've seen every Borat sketch that has been made available to the public and the easy targets are beginning to not be as shocking or entertaining as they once were . He aims all of his material at the idiots who fall for it or who have not seen him on TV . Bringing a ( fake ) hooker to a snooty High Society dinner , boozing with moronic college frat-boys or jive-talking to a stuck-up concierge is not intelligent comedy anymore . His method of exposing bigots , hypocrites and narrow-minded idiots with his special blend of Socratic irony and entrapment has been used to great effect in the past but it's getting old . Since this movie is probably the last we will see of Borat it's a shame he didn't come up with a new edge . Sacha Baron Cohen must have the biggest balls in the whole world to do what he does though . I could never keep a straight face while pretending to interrogate a yard sale lady / gypsy over a Barbie doll / woman she has shrunk . Nor could I deliberately , over-exaggerate a massive fall into priceless antiques in a store and not pay for it . There is one particular scene that pushes the boundaries of taste so far back that it could circle Pluto several times over . I will mention nothing of the content of this scene but I have to warn you , it is insane , teeth-grindingly funny and absolutely disgusting . You need to see it to believe it . Obviously there are some parts to this film that are totally staged but if you try to figure it out , Sacha Baron Cohen has to tried to make it as little-faked as possible and you'll realize how it's all done . Of particular note is the surprisingly emotional musical score to the film which really stood out and made an impression . Strange considering the type of film that it is . I must hunt down the CD . No one will fall for Borat's schtick anymore . This movie will make him too popular . He goes out with a predictable BANG instead of KABOOM !
Could have done without the canned laughter	In this cartoon Pinky is happily lazing about in a hammock when a snooty narrator interrupts and prompts him into doing some DIY instead guiltless relaxation . At first Pinky tries to make something out of wood but ends up sawing part of his house off . And then his tail . While trying to relax in bed he is put off by the sound of his shower leaking . The snooty narrator encourages him to fix it but old Pinky has no idea how to so he just tapes up the shower door and lets it slowly fill up . Finally , tiring of the narrator intrusive nagging he loads up a blunderbuss and scares him away . It's quite funny but don't ask me why there is canned laughter . It's completely pointless .
The last of the finest .	In their last on-screen outing as Holmes and Watson ( they still did radio plays with each other after this movie ) Rathbone and Bruce find themselves involved in a music box mystery . It seems that anyone who bought one of three matching boxes from a recent auction ends up either dead or with a nasty bump on the head . Assuming that there must be a weird connection Holmes takes the case . The story rivals even The Voice of Terror in terms of sheer implausibility . When the purpose of the music box is reveal you have to wonder why anyone would go to all that effort . But it's still entertaining and Patricia Morrison makes for a brilliant villainess . Producer and Director Roy William Neill died not long after this film was released , which is probably why it ended up being the last . They could have went on a lot longer , especially if they started using some of Conan Doyle's original works ( something that they very rarely did , opting for original screenplays instead ) , although this one does reference two of stories as past cases . A fine , if unspectacular end of a definitive era .
Two great games , one crap game	Die Hard Trilogy was one of the first games I ever got for my PC many years ago . And it's still fun to play thanks to the fast and furious gameplay , well of the first 2 games anyway . The third was awful . Die Hard is a third-shooter set in the Nakatomi Plaza in LA's Century City . The set design is impressively similar to that of the movie and John McClane's mission involves scouring each and every floor for terrorist ( actually just thieves ) scum , hostages and bombs . The graphics are slightly dodgy and can get a bit confusing but it's a bloody thrill ride for sure . This game was developed upon more in the under-rated Die Hard : Nakatomi Plaza from 2001 . Die Harder is a first person shooter much like Operation Wolf in which you go through Washington DC's Dulles Airport blasting at everything you see . The best thing about this game is that everything in it can be shot and destroyed . It was hectic carnage and there are some brilliant blood splatters . Die Hard with a Vengeance ( my fave film of the trilogy ) is a really crappy driving game much like Crazy Taxi only with boring , near impossible mission , terrible graphics and no lasting appeal . I never went back to this game more than twice . The others however , can be played again and again . And furthermore , the musical score on the first two games were brilliant ! The third has pleasant enough tunes but it never came near the action-packed cues that came before it . Nothing like Michael Kamen's work on the movies , but cool anyway . Graphics B Sound Gameplay Lasting Appeal
SNAKE RULES	He's the best anti-hero in the history of cinema and ALWAYS has the last laugh . He just doesn't care . All Americans wish they could feel this way but Snake . . . he's just conscience free . The only person he looks out for or cares about is himself . And he's an ex-soldier too . The action scenes in this film are few and far between but it has a strange feel to it . It's gritty film-making . Much better than the cheesy ( but still good ) sequel . Check this out whenever you can .
Something new	This is one of the first Tom and Jerry shorts that doesn't take place inside a generic 1940s house but inside , as the title would suggest , a bowling alley . This new environment allows for fresher gags and more imagination . There are some inventive sequences and it doesn't resort to the ancient clichés of Jerry plugging Tom's tail into a power socket or putting his tail in a mousetrap . There are no humans to be seen at all and it appears that Tom and Jerry at alone in the bowling alley . Which is good . I find that extra characters such as stray cats and unseen humans ( including the staggeringly un-offensive Mammy-Two-Shoes ) to be a distraction . New locations , new torture devices and no diversions would make Tom and Jerry funny every single time . Too bad they mostly never really turned out that way .
Leave a message !	" Isn't it funny ? A phone rings and it could be anybody . But a ringing phone must be answered . " Those words were Kiefer Sutherland's closing lines in Phone Booth and they could easily be the last words in Cellular , too . It's interesting that the script comes from the writer of Phone Booth ( that would be Larry Cohen , the brains behind Maniac Cop and The Stuff ) , a movie about a man trapped in one tiny place on the phone to a complete stranger and yet Cellular is about a man trapped on the phone to a complete stranger who is free to go anywhere he wants . Only Cellular is a more wholesome and complete film than Phone Booth . It doesn't make any attempt at satire , or make fun of the media , but does have terrific energy and intelligence . No , Cellular is NOT a no-brainer . Ryan , played by Chris Evans ( no , not the ginger , speccy nerd from British TV ) , is a punk kid who never takes anything seriously and is far too laid back to keep his girlfriend happy . But his life crosses paths with a woman in trouble . Will he finally grow up when her fate becomes his responsibility ? Kim Basinger ( aging more gracefully than I previously assumed ) is that woman . She's being held in a spooky old attic by corrupt cop Jason Statham and painstakingly " repairs " a broken phone . She's about to reach out to somebody , anybody . The only number she manages to hook up to is Ryan's . He immediately takes the problem to the fuzz . The only cop who will listen is Mooney ( William H Macy ) , but he's too fed up and dismissive to take much notice . Not at first , anyway . As Ryan races around the city , overcoming difficult and dangerous obstacles , Mooney puts it all together and slowly realises things ain't what they seem . I had only ever seen Evans in the rather dull Perfect Score before this movie , but he made for a totally cool hero that everyone can relate to . Most actors his age irritate the hell out of me . I can only imagine how bad this film would have been with Seann William Scott , or Freddie Prinze Jr . , for example . Basinger does everything she can with her damsel in distress . It's usually quite insulting to an actress's intelligence to reduce her to such a cliché , though she manages to bring integrity and desperation to the role more convincingly than most actresses her age . And of course we all love and adore Jason Statham . He may be a skinhead with a funny sounding voice , but be it hero or villain he's dead cool and makes Vin ' Donald Duck ' Diesel look like a right poof . Director David Ellis races through the far-fetched plot without looking back and keeps everything fast-paced and exciting right up to the last minute . He's the man who made a good sequel out of a bad original ( that would be Final Destination ) and with many other directors the ludicrousness of the plot would be all too apparent . Here , we don't get a single breath to take it all in . The show-stealing is split two ways . Macy is great as the Ned Flanders-type cop , but Rick Hoffmann is hilarious as an obnoxious lawyer who stands in Ryan's way and gets his comeuppance not once , not twice , but thrice . There's not been a kidnapping thriller as gripping as this since Kurt Russell lost his wife in Breakdown . Cellular is definitely the right number . Oh , and in case it was bugging you , that movie the bad guys are watching is Final Destination 2
Junkie ?	Is it just me or is Pac-Man a metaphor for taking too many ecstasy pills ? Think about it , you've got some happy little face stumbling around in the dark munching as many pills as he can get but when things go bad he's chased by ghosts all over the place until he can get more pills . Either this is really subliminal subtext by designer Toru Iwatani or it's just an amazing coincidence and I'm reading far too much into it . Either way Pac-Man is like THE biggest ever arcade game , which is quite amazing since many more advanced and technologically superior games came out after this . And it has one funky little theme tune !
Classic old-school beat-em-up	A chick has been kidnapped ! It's up to you to defeat the punks and rescue her ! : The plot synopsis to pretty much EVERY side-scrolling beat-em-up of the late 80s and early 90s . Which was a magical time for arcade fans . I found a Vendetta machine in an arcade when I was on holiday with my girlfriend and we spend over and hour fighting our way through it . It reminded me of when I was a kid , when arcades were more abundant and the games were almost always iconic of the era . Vendetta contains all of the typical ingredients of the genre . Side-scrolling levels containing slum streets , construction sites , Manhattan backdrop , power-ups , bonus points , usable weapons dropped by generic but nonetheless cartoonish bad guys wearing typical thug outfits or biker costumes with muscles upon muscles , eccentric end of level bosses about 3 times the size of any normal human , the need for dozens of continues so the machine swallows every Quarter you've got and more . I could go on . Yes , the games were phenomenally hard , you sweated like a pig hammering the buttons and yes , they were sexist and differed from each other in ever decreasing ways but they were brilliant . If you find it somewhere or if you have MAME on your PC then give it a try . It may not rank as highly as Double Dragon , Final Fight or Bare Knuckle ( Streets of Rage ) but it's still a damn fine beat-em-up !
A quirky and slightly absurd comedy	Years before The Coen Brothers unleashed their trademark eccentric characters and even before Woody Allen got on the scene with his endless talkies , Blake Edwards gave us this subtle but weird comedy that seems to be overlooked by most audiences desensitised by films like Mud in Manhattan , Hitch and the latest Bridget Jones crap . What most of these films lack is a strong sense of character and involvement in their world . You really do feel drawn into the relationship between Holly Golightly ( Audrey Hepburn ) , a teenage runaway who ended up a high-class escort in New York and Paul ' Fred ' Varjak ( a youthful George Peppard ) a writer / gigolo who has had nothing to inspire him of late until Holly came into his life . The only time caricature comes into the film is Mickey Rooney's Japanese landlord ( and he's not Japanese ) , but he hardly features that much for it to be annoying . The film has a lot in common with There's Something About Mary , which I am sure owes most of its ideas to . Almost every man who meets Holly falls head over heels in love with her but it takes someone just like her for Holly to love back . Both Holly and Paul are struggling to make their own way in the city . Both have to sell themselves to the opposite sex in order to make ends meet . While Paul just wants to be a successful writer , Holly is desperate to marry a rich millionaire to snag some of the fortune for herself and take care of her brother once he leaves the army . Her escort girl lifestyle is taking its toll on her so much that 6am is only the end of the night for her and not morning . As a result she eats a fast food breakfast on a deserted street while longingly window-shopping at Tiffany's , a shop she'll probably never afford to buy from . However you just know that , despite not having much money , Holly and Paul will take good care of each other by the end of the movie . What gives this film a unique charm on top of the performances are the many oddball moments and quirky touches . Most of them supplied by Holly's cat , known simply as Cat . And Henry Mancini's score ( before he and Blake Edwards teamed up for the famous Pink Panther ) seems right out of a Broadway musical and plays a strong part in making the movie what it is . There's no generic piano cues or pop songs here . I haven't read the book so I cannot compare like so many other people here have , but the film certainly does stand up on it's own . No film sticks entirely to the books they are based on anyway .
Strong fantasy-mystery but see the director's cut	Peter Jackson approaches his own script with the kind of technique most Hollywood directors wouldn't ever even imagine . Jackson has his own and unique brand of movie-making and this is a perfect example of how to make an original and superior film . Michael J . Fox ( who looks like he did some working out for the role ) plays Frank Bannister , a Psychic investigator , who pursues a strange and sinister cloaked figure who seems to be terrorising both the physical and supernatural world . That's all I'm going to tell because I don't want to ruin it for you . Universal tried to sell the film totally on it's wonderful SFX . But this was in a year when audiences were wowed by the superficial FX of ID4 and didn't really care about a bunch of ghosts . The Frighteners is criminally under-rated and underseen so I suggest you run down to your local store and either buy the DVD right now . You'll love it . It's a shame that Universal won't release a DVD version of the laserdisc SE ( complete with the 4-hour documentary ) and the 124-minute director's cut of the film . You'd think with their willingness to do 86 different releases of American Pie and with Peter Jackson's massive success with the LOTR films they'd cash-in on The Frighters . But no ! Idiots !
Interesting and realistic	Directed by Tim Blake Nelson , most recently recognisable from his performances in Holes and The Good Girl , Eye of God is a story of doomed love and loneliness told out of order . Martha Plimpton is Ainsley Dupree ( a name I think sounds quite cool and have since used in stories of my own ) a waitress who falls in love with a dangerous ex-con ( Kevin Anderson ) . After wondering what the hell she has soon married into she seeks comfort with lonely teenager Tom . I liked this movie a lot and the performances were very good all round . Especially Holbrook , he was just so believable as an old sheriff who's seen it all . Nick Stahl is much better here than he was in Disturbing Behavior . I think the last few scenes with him and Martha Plimpton were quite intimate and it really made the whole movie totally enjoyable for me . Highly recommended but quite a rare film to come across in stores or on TV .
Not a sequel , just an expansion	I was a bit confused when I first saw it in the shops . It's real obvious that this is an ' expansion ' and not a sequel . The gameplay is EXACTLY the same . While more of Dungeon Siege isn't a bad thing , THIS much more does get kind of repetitive , especially when you kill the 4 billionth skag / skitter / skitterskag . It's fun to begin with but it soon becomes infuriating . There's pretty much no reason to use anything but mêlée weapons during the whole game . Magic is totally useless and up until the last level , range weapons are pathetic too . And just after the halfway mark you can just forget about collecting gold . It's pointless . I finished the game with about 500 , 000 in gold . But there's nothing to use it on . Why even have gold to collect if you can't use it ? And the weapons and armour you can buy with it are just rubbish . They don't give you much of an upgrade or boost . They just look different from each other . There's nothing of any great use . The controls desperately need rethought . You click in one direction and sometimes the characters will run away in the other . What's the deal with that ? And it's far too , way too easy to get lost . You spend hours wandering around the labyrinthine levels without a clue where you should go . There's a megamap button on the screen but when you click on it you are presented with a black rectangle . Wow ! That's useful . There's not much of a pay-off when you finish the game either . Once you kill the bad guy you just switch the game off as there is nothing left to do . Boy , am I glad I stuck it out to the end . The good parts are just the re-used elements of the first game . The music is great ( why is there no score CD ? ) . The plot developments are interesting ( tho they go nowhere ) and there is a great atmosphere to many of the exotic levels . My best hint in regards to playing the game is to NOT allow Nardulo to join your team . He's weak , dies easily and will use up all your health potions . Is this worth getting if you already have the first game ? Definitely not ! But the original Dungeon Siege is included in the 3-disc pack ( no switching the CDs is necessary , the whole game is loaded all at once-quite impressive ! ! ! ) so if you really love bashing in goblins and love it just as much after bashing the 50 zillionth , gillionth , thrillionth , trillionth , billionth , millionth goblin then go right ahead and play both games in a row . I can't imagine it would be healthy tho .
Quite funny , well above average	Tom , now a cowboy ( or cowcat ) on a farm somewhere in Texas is involved in his usual pursuit of Jerry when a gorgeous girl cat arrives . He is immediately smitten and falls in love , hoping to impress her with a tough guy act , and serenading her with a mimed song . Not taking too kindly to being treated as a slave in his love game , Jerry messes up Tom's plans and gets him on the wrong side of the farmyard bull . It's a pretty funny cartoon , especially when Jerry tampers with the speed of the record Tom is miming to , and there's quite a bit of inventive visual humor too . I just wish that Tom would get the girl for once .
She'll be coming round the mountain when she comes	Donald is off on a trek through the wilderness following a railroad track with one of those red polka-dot sacks on a stick ( what is the deal with that ? ) . And he's very hungry . He comes across Pete's shack ( big , bad Pete appears to be some kind of railroad worker in this cartoon ) and tries to steal some dinner . But Pete catches him and forces Donald to do some lumber-jacking . It doesn't sound like much of a set-up but there are quite a few laughs and it's as close to a Looney Tunes cartoon as Disney gets . The anarchic animation and gags are all funny for a change with no misses . I think this is due to the fact that in this short Donald's wise-ass attitude doesn't make him do dumb things . He just wants to escape Pete . Look out for the bit where Donald is blown up with dynamite and tell me how much he looks like Daffy . And am I wrong or has Pete used Donald's bill as an ashtray before ?
Far , far superior to Shrek !	I think that CGI animated movies are stuck in a pretty bad rut . Before going to see ( the rather boring and uneventful ) Monster House the other day I was tortured to endless trailers for CGI talking animal movies . We already have Shrek , Shrek 2 , Finding Nemo , Over the Hedge , Ice Age , Ice Age 2 , Shark Tale , Madagascar , The Wild and Chicken Little . Now we can look forward to the likes of The Barnyard , Open Season and the highly gay-looking Happy Feet in coming months . Are studios and writers incapable of coming up with anything else ? All these movies really say to kids is that the world is a happy , colorful place filled with fun and joy . Well , that's a lie . CGI animation opens up so many , many exciting possibilities for dynamic , subjective and otherwise impossible stories . Why are we constantly stuck with talking animals ? Kids are not stupid , but in this world we are endlessly insulting their intelligence with moronic PC crap . Children have more potential than adults give them credit for and they deserve a better range of movies . The only good CGI animated kids movie I can think of in recent years is The Polar Express ( okay , it's motion capture and not animation , but you know what I mean ) , but that's about to change with Hoodwinked . Most of you might unfairly dismiss Hoodwinked as a Shrek clone but it completely stomps all over anything our Scottish Ugly has to offer ( which is nothing more than endless pop-culture references anyway ) . Beginning at the tail end of the story , Hoodwinked is told mostly in flashback , through Police interrogation , to the events leading up to Little Red Riding Hood discovering the Wolf in Grandmas bed . But this is not a story you've heard before . The Wolf is actually an investigative journalist ( that's Chevy Chase's Fletch : same clothes , same personality , similar theme tune , same disguises and even some of the same dialogue ) who has been tracking clues leading to a sort of corporate takeover of the forest . Someone has destroyed a lot of local business and plans to cap it all off with stealing Grandma's secret cookie recipe . Told from Red's , Wolf's , The Woodsman's and Grandma's point of view , all three versions of the events connect in clever and unique ways . Every one of them filled with loads of laugh-out-loud moments and some pretty cool action that never feels forced or contrived . There is not a single annoying character ( rare for a kid's film ) and it's hard to say who steals the show but if I HAD to choose , it would be Japeth the Goat . From a technical point of view , Hoodwinked looks more like Jimmy Neutron than it does Cars ) , but you'll hardly notice it . The story is what counts and when it's as sophisticated and funny as this , it's only a minor , minor quibble . Made for a meagre $15 million ( compared to $70 million for Cars ) , they might not have had the best animators of Pixar behind them , but it still all good . There's never a dull moment in Hoodwinked and kids will love it . It is , in one word , brilliant ! The best kid's movie in ages and probably for the rest of the year . This is one franchise I really want to see more of .
Stomps all over Roland Emmerich's Godzilla	Only once in a rare while are we treated to a movie so innovative and unique . It's sad to think that there will only be so many film-going experiences like Cloverfield in my life while the void is filled with more generic fare . In terms of story it is very similar to the awful 1998 clunker Godzilla , but is a world apart when it comes to execution . Everyone by now knows the premise of the filming of a loft party being interrupted by the arrival of a giant monster in Manhattan , so I won't go into loads of description over that . I'm a firm believer in the fact that the camera is the eyes of the person watching the film and with Cloverfield ( like The Blair Witch Project before it ) we are put right into the central character's shoes as he stumbles around the darkest corners of the city with his ever diminishing group of friends . It's been repeated a million times , but I too believe that what we DON'T see is scarier than what we do . Once you bring the monster out of the shadows all the mystery and fear evaporates . For the majority of the movie we never really get to see all of the monster , perhaps a tentacle here or a foot there , but not much of the whole thing . We do get to see a lot of the ugly parasites that cling to its body however . There are some brilliant and eternally memorable scenes in Cloverfield , the best being hard to nail down but I loved the idea of entering a crooked skyscraper via the deserted tower that it's leaning against . What a truly unique set-piece . Of course the movie is going to have it's critics and there will be plenty who are not satisfied with the ending . JJ Abrams has said that he plans to do a single sequel from another point of view , but I feel this will ruin the magic . In fact , JJ Abrams ' marketing campaign and back-story has already tarnished the film for me a little bit . He has stated that the monster comes from the sea but I prefer to not know for certain where it comes from . I imagined it coming from outer space myself as the idea of a random creature arriving from the infinite darkness of space to far more terrifying than a monster from the limited environment of our own oceans . And the viral marketing is way out of hand . Let me put set it all straight . Rob Hawkins has been made vice president of a company in Japan . That company is the Slusho soft drink firm . Marlena is seen drinking plenty of Slusho at the beginning of the film . The parasites on the creature apparently eat the secret ingredient of Slusho deep in the ocean . They smelled this on her , which explains why she is the only one of the group who is bitten . The near-unnoticeable ' splash ' in the water at the end of the film is part of a satellite which has fallen out of space and apparently wakes up the monster somehow . What a load of garbage ! Is Rob Hawkins the centre of the universe or something ? Why is all this contrived crap revolving around him ? Why they came up with this drivel instead of leaving it all unexplained is beyond me . Nevertheless , I will still be looking forward to the sequel next year .
Beautifully shot and brilliantly acted tragedy	Teen life isn't The OC . There's always something deeper occasionally sinister beneath the surface of seemingly ordinary kids . Some lash out , some keep it in and let it eat them alive . George is a fat kid with learning difficulties who eats alone in the cafeteria and aggressively bullies every other kid around him , especially Sam ( Rory Culkin ) . When enough is enough Sam gets help from his older brother's pal to set George up for a prank that will teach him a lesson . They go on a mock birthday boating trip with the intention of humiliating him . Trouble is , when George has people being nice to him he's very , very nice and quiet back to them . He has no clue of what their planning . Sam and his brother want to back down but the leader Marty won't leave it alone . George is like the spawn of Satan and the son of God . His unpredictable manner throw the gang into a state of confusion over what to do with him . But he pushes his luck to far and ends up dead . Did he deserve it or not ? It's entirely up to you . Mean Creek is a sombre morality play that is as gritty and realistic as anything you'll witness in real life . Director Jacob Aaron Estes draws faultless performances out of his young cast , so much so that even when they are not speaking you can read what they are thinking in their eyes . He atmospherically captures the Pacific-Northwest countryside and pulls you into a engaging story without making it seem overbearing . It's ironic that a realistic teen movie would be rated R instead of PG-13 but if you're a concerned parent worried whether or not this is suitable for younger kids then I would suggest you give it a shot . There's nothing suggestive about it and it might actually help your kids understand bullies rather than hating them . Either way , this is a great film for anyone who enjoys good acting and an involving story .
Kids playing action movie as an actual film .	An unfortunate , misjudged and misunderstood film that could have been something great but only clings to the bottom-rung of respectability . For a start , it has an unashamedly awful and truly despicable villain who oozes evil from every stinking orifice . When eccentric bad guys are not hammy , they are Ramon Cota ( a sickening performance by villain's villain of choice and villain of the week Billy Drago ) . Cota is a Columbian drug lord , who ships massive amounts of cocaine into America . He kills DEA agents with unnatural glee , murders pregnant women , tortures people to death in a gas chamber , rapes women , murders their husbands , murders sick babies and uses their bodies to smuggle cocaine - you get the picture , this guy is lower than minus infinity . In a rare opportunity to catch him , Colonel Scott McCoy ( the ever-bearded Chuck Norris ) kidnaps Cota in mid-air and drags him into court only to watch him leave with virtually no charge . More DEA agents are kidnapped and it's up to Chuck to rescue them from death . So he heads off to the fictional South American country of San Carlos for some mighty kicking-of-ass . Killing Cota is not his mission , rescuing the DEA agents is , but you know that Cota is going to get what he deserves ( with a little bit of slightly unsubtle philosophy from Norris ) . The script is generic and by numbers . Never before has a movie been so strictly routine , but there are some real cool action scenes and so much melodrama that it could fuel EastEnders for a decade . The direction leaves a lot to be desired . If someone other than Chuck's brother had made this , we would have a hugely enjoyable film on our hands . Instead plot holes , illogical moments and a general feel of immaturity bog it down . The action ranges from Norris flying through the sky , swinging through the jungle , falling off cliffs and dodging rockets . The main problem with the direction is that Aaron Norris uses the logic , " If it is in slow motion , then it is cool . " He wants to drag out every bloody detail , every death dance and every penetration of every bullet . It's a shame Delta Force 2 isn't hyper-kinetic , because the slo-mo becomes very noticeable . Chuck Norris ' methods are also highly questionable . For a man who moves at 48 frames per second he sure does lay waste to thousands of Drago's henchman very well . And beating up the new Delta Force recruits to train them in the deadly arts is just bizarre . General Taylor ( John P . Ryan ) , a character so relentless gung-ho and over-the-top that he really should be in a pantomime , is McCoy's boss and he enjoys himself way too much when he tags along on the mission to blow away zillions of nameless henchman from a helicopter that is so indestructible and equipped with a never-ending supply of ammo you wonder why the REAL Delta Force doesn't use this thing over in Afghanistan . Ryan certainly did wrap himself in the American flag for this character . But hey , it worked for Stallone with John Rambo . The single spot-on aspect of the whole movie has to be the strong and rousing musical score by Frederick Talgorn . If the rest of the movie was as good as this , then everything would be different . Instead Delta Force 2 is a mixed bag . There is a good film here , desperate to get out , but you have to claw your way through to find it .
Ouch !	When asked to name something hard one might suggest Mr . T or the Incredible Hulk . What you don't know is that there is nothing harder on this Earth than the video game Metal Slug . It is honestly one of the most punishing arcade experiences of my life . Obviously it's designed to be this way since it prompts the player to feed more and more coins into the machine . It took me 41 continues to finish the entire game , that would work out at over $10 if I was spending quarters . Why would anyone play such a difficult game ? How about because Metal Slug is bursting at the seams with action and humor . Along with Turrican and Midnight Resistance it's one of the best side-scrolling , run and gun shoot-em-ups ever . Watching things blow up has never been so much fun . But you'll be getting blisters pretty damn fast on the tips of your fingers .
Will stand the test of time forever .	I've seen Raiders of the Lost Ark numerous times on TV , DVD and big screen . My local theatre had a special showing last night and the 400-seat screen completely sold out ( as Indy films always do ) . Luckily for me and my pal , we got the last 2 tickets available ! I can't think of many films that still sell-out 25 years after their original release . There's just something about Indy movies ( iconic hero , affection , epic spectacle ) that brings you back again and again . The only trouble with that is there are zillions of reviews , critiques and dissections of this movie already out there , so what I have to offer will probably not be anything new . I will however not go the way of the cliché and mention 1930's serials , Tom Selleck or the sword / gun fight . I will , however , ask you one question . Did you know that some of the more iconic , memorable sequences from Raiders owe quite a lot to Duck Tales ? What ? Surely it's the other way around ? Well , no . The globe-trotting adventures of Scrooge McDuck , Huey , Duey , Luey and Donald in Carl Bank's Disney comic-books from the 50s came first . If you can find some of these then you'll surely notice the similarities . The hunt for the Ark of the Covenant is more than just an excuse for action . So many movies these days seem to come up with action first and string them together with some lame plot . Movies like this are quickly forgotten and one of the reasons Raiders holds up so well is because it works the Covenant story so well into the plot . The action comes in a succession of set-pieces . I do enjoy films that have to increasingly better themselves in every scene . Raiders introduced this as a standard that the sequels had to live up to . My fave scene has to be the massive truck chase through Egypt , which is made up of many of its own smaller sequences . One little idiosyncrasy I like about Indy is that even though he's a College Professor and Doctor , he has no beef killing people . So very far from the ubiquitous PC heroes of todays movies . You might think that it's rather geeky to hype up the editing and sound design , but they do stand out from recent action movies . The gunfire and punching seem to have a sort of ' Indy ' signature sound to them , that I've not heard in any other films . And obviously , John William's classic score is one of those themes that just everybody in the world knows ( though I prefer his score to Temple of Doom ) , truly one of the best movie themes ever . Better than Star Wars ! I'm not sure if Spielberg planned on Raiders starting the Indy franchise but there's already enough in here to establish a whole universe of potential stories and character arcs . There's talk of a fourth movie at the moment , but I personally don't think it will happen and I don't want it to . It's perfect existing as a trilogy and a sequel that comes traipsing in 18 years after the last is just not going to feel right . Even if you are hungry for more Indy then there are loads of books and video games out there and then there's the Young Indiana Jones TV show ( where are the DVDs ? ) , which are official Indy canon and even starred Ford once ( they bounced around in time ) . I am giving Raiders because I just have a soft spot for Temple of Doom ( which is obviously a movie ) . Even 25 years after it first came out it still has the power to captivate the audience and provoke sheer excitement every time . And in 25 years it will still be far superior to almost everything . Now there's something you cannot say about The Fast and the Furious ! Sigh , where did all the special movies go ?
Addictive and clever , easier too .	I loved the first RE game on the Gamecube . The graphics , the sound , the ambiance were all top-notch . Never before ( with the exceptions of the Myst games on the PC ) had I been so totally immersed in the atmosphere of a video game before . RE was thrilling and frightening . All of that returns in Resident Evil Zero , a prequel about the events leading up to the T-Virus outbreak in the Umbrella Mansion in the Arklay Mountains . There are a few differences though . This time around you are in control of 2 characters . One is Rebecca Chambers , the medic girl from RE . And the other is Billy Cowen , an escaped convict who teams up with Rebecca when they meet on an abandoned train . Together they take on Zombies and giant insects as they try to figure out what has happened in the Umbrella training facility . It's a lot easier than the first one . Though there are far more enemies to blow away , there are way more bullets . So you don't have to be so careful about reserving ammo . The Crimson Heads are also gone ( thankfully ) so when a zombie is dead it stays dead . And lets be honest , those Crimson Heads were terrifying . Originally this game was made for the Nintendo 64 but was never released so they just remade it for the Gamecube . I wise choice as the game fully shows off what the Gamecube is capable of . RE Zero is full of ominous camera angles , dingy locations and a dark atmosphere extending all the way down to the tiniest detail . Though I did particularly like the bright and somber ( ? ) ending . Complete this game quick enough and you'll unlock a bonus game called Leech Hunter in which Rebecca and Billy ( now in different clothing ) can run around the training facility blasting at things . It's just for fun but it's still quite cool . If you're a fan of RE 1 then RE Zero is a must have . Not quite as good but still a damn cool game !
Highly addictive once more . . .	. . . but still not much of an improvement . The gameplay is still EXACTLY the same and the missions are not too dissimilar either . But the cool soundtrack is still there and those radio DJs are funny as hell . Jill Tasker's news updates are awesome and there are some brilliant songs too . The graphics have improved tho and there are some real cool weapons . Check out the colors as you blow up 10 cars with a ray gun . But this is the only real difference between this and the first . If you have the original this is , at a push , still worth buying . But it just feels so much more like an expansion pack than a whole new game tho .
Every new town just seems to bring you down	I'll get my one and only gripe out of the way first . I don't like the title . Rambo 4 or John Rambo would have been far more appropriate but I will call the film Fourth Blood in this review to avoid confusion between the characters name and the film title . For the past 20 years John Rambo has remained in Thailand since his rescue of Colonel Trautman in Afghanistan . He lives a quiet life as a snake hunter and fisherman until he is propositioned by a group of simple and naive American missionaries from some quaint country town ( think of Ned Flanders and his pals ) to take them up river into wartorn Bhurma where carnage , rape , mutilations and amputations are a daily occurrence so they can help the sick and teach bible or some other such Mother Theresa uselessness . It takes some convincing but Rambo agrees to do it and is only happy to see the back of them . But when the missionaries are kidnapped ( which was inevitable ) he leads a ragtag bunch of mercenaries across the border to annihilate every Junta in their way . But Rambo doesn't merely shoot the baddies , he rips them apart in ways so bloody it would make Jason Voorhees blush . Yes , it's a rather thin story , but so what ? The only people who would point this out are those desperate to hate the film . But if your film taste usually involves Keira Knightley in a frock or Cameron Diaz doing romcom then what the hell are you doing watching a Rambo film anyway ? I had worries that the Rambo character might not be relevant anymore . He hasn't been around since the 80s and he stood for something rather different back then . Stallone has always played him as a cynic and someone who mostly doesn't care about the world after what it's done to him . With all of the carnage and cheapening of life that happens daily on our planet it does seem fitting that Rambo would retreat to a quiet corner until mankind needs his ruthless efficiency for killing again . Stallone looks great for his age and this , his seventh film as director , is certainly his most hardcore . At 61 it seems that old Sly has more testosterone pumping through his arteries than ever before . Another thing that worried me was the loss of Jerry Goldsmith and Richard Crenna . A Rambo movie simply cannot be a Rambo movie without those classic , signature themes . Brian Tyler , who is certainly not the best composer in Hollywood , does a competent , if not exceptional , job of blending his own tough action noise with Goldsmith's memorable tunes . Richard Crenna on the other hand is one of those actors that really should have lived forever without aging . His absence is not explained in the movie but Stallone claims that ' Trautman died the day my friend Richard died ' . Though I did love the black and white dream sequence at the halfway mark . Rambo has vivid flashbacks to the previous films with images of Colonel Trautman . His voice calls out to him ' John . . . John ! ' until it fades into the voice of a Pastor calling for Rambo's help . It's like Trautman , Rambo's only real friend / father figure , is still trying to give him guidance from the next world . It could have been longer , but legend has it that Stallone has a director's cut in the works for DVD and it's surely a great night at the movies . It finishes of the Rambo story perfectly will surely please every single Rambo fan on the face of the earth . Fourth Blood is a real action movie , no PG13 Live Free or Die Hard garbage here . This is what an action film , a MAN'S film should be .
DUCK SEASON ! FIRE !	In the first of a series of three , Daffy Duck and Bugs Bunny argue over which one of them should be hunted and shot by the ever-gullible Elmer Fudd . Bugs is too smart to be outwitted by the reactionary and hyperactive Daffy . He keeps it cool and collected as Daffy screams his head off never knowing what he really IS saying . He even grabs Elmer's shotgun and screams ' Duck season ! Fire ! ' , resulting in his bill being blown off . It's the biggest laugh in the cartoon . And it's a laugh so good Joe Dante re-used it in Looney Tunes : Back in Action . Though at the end of this one , Elmer Fudd gets what he deserves and Bugs and Daffy get a little payback . Followed by Rabbit Seasoning and Duck , Rabbit , Duck . Daffy Rules !
Absolute genius classic !	There was never anything quite like The Young Ones and there never will be . It's almost impossible to copy this outrageously bizarre and far-fetched TV show anyway . It's even impossible to exaggerate how crazy it was . Do I have to say I totally love it ? each episode is crammed full of eternally quotable dialogue , wonderful physical comedy and insane , unexpected plot developments . The Young Ones takes place in a universe where absolutely ANTHING can and WILL happen . Rick is undeniably the best character tho . He and Vivian get into the stupidest fights and argue over the dumbest of things . Neil the hippy is also consistently amusing in his many failed attempts to off himself . Mike hardly ever had any funny lines but thankfully no episode really ever revolved around him . Plus a Bolowski family member ( always played by Alexi Sayle ) pops up in each episode to add to the mayhem . What makes the show priceless are the totally irrelevant and senseless intercut scenes . Check out the episode ' CASH ' for the best example of this . And , in an effort to raise the budget from ' sitcom ' to ' light entertainment ' the show had a musical performance each week from the likes of Jools Holland , Madness and Motorhead . They never intrude tho as they are cut over madcap montages . It speaks volumes of the youth of 80's Britain and has a lot to say about the politics of the Tory Government at the time . All four play penniless students , surviving on lentils , who are completely unconcerned about their exams or coming bottom in the whole world . This is mainly channelled thru Rick ( Mayall co-wrote the show with Ben Elton ) who is the most studenty of them all , a wannabe anarchist and people's poet . Vyvian is a hard , hardcore Sex Pistols-like punk / thug who thinks nothing of having steel stars stuck onto his forehead or chopping his fingers off for a laugh . Neil smells . And has no quibbles picking up dead pigeons off the street to cook for dinner . Mike is a ladies man , despite the fact there are precious few ladies around him . All four get on like a house burning down . Or exploding like a cigar thrown into fart gas . The show was shot on early 80's video with an aspect ratio of 1 . 33 : 1 . the picture quality is not the best but it's always looked like a TV show so it's perfectly adequate . The sound is Mono but that's all you need to enjoy . The extras seem cool but they're not really . There is a bonus episode from Filthy Rich and Catflap and one from Bottom ( the episode ' Smells ' in which Ritchie and Eddie try to lure two lesbians with foul-smelling pheromone spray ) . The 15-minutes long ' Creating the Young Ones ' is quite superficial and deserved to be much longer . And where are the new interviews with Edmondson , Ryan and Sayle ? The same applies to ' The Young Ones and the 80s ' . Why wasn't it longer ? Five postcards of all the main stars are also included in the set . And you must buy it .
An absolutely mad ( and tragic ) pisstake .	In his US version of his TV show Ali G had an episode where he visited loads of Top Brass in the TV business . As a joke he created a pilot episode of a show called ' Spyz ' in which he played . . . wait for it . . . James Bond . But this is not the James Bond we know of . Instead it's a horribly low-budget amateur film with all the sophistication of something slapped together on a high school editing suite complete with a tawdry urban / industrial soundtrack that actually gets a bit infectious . It's so deliberately awful that you'll wet yourself . The film begins with Ali G / Bond strolling , rather unrealistically , through some sort of common ground when he is ambushed by a bunch of anonymous thugs . The ensuing fight is terribly choreographed and looks even faker than a toy-fight , playground wrestling match . The one thug Ali G / Bond doesn't kill happens to a lady ( Isla Fisher ) and they end up making spontaneous ' love ' against the nearest tree . Before Ali G / Bond is finished he receives an important phone-call about a bomb in a ' nucular plant ' and rushes off home to get his Uzi ( which he keeps on top of a cupboard in the kitchen ) . At home his wife moans at him that he spends more time saving the world than their marriage and that he better not miss ' little Jonathan's birthday baseball match ' later on that night . Ali G / Bond's response is no more than ' fck off ' . Once he has found the ' bomb ' ( which is nothing more than a couple of wires wrapped around a battery in a small plastic toolbox ) and disarms it he is once again ambushed by more anonymous heavies . The gun battle involves them not actually firing at each other but instead pointing their weapons and making the sound effects themselves . Ali G / Bond manages to kill them all but none of the impacts on the body are actually seen . Instead , once they are already dead we see close-ups of their ' wounds ' which are made up of strawberry syrup being poured onto their bodies and oozing out of their mouths . Now Ali G / Bond goes back to the lady spy's house and makes more misogynistic love to her , her pal and her pal's pal . It's a horribly superfluous scene , but it's supposed to be . It ends up being a bit hard to watch and you'll be seriously embarrassed if your parents or grandparents are there watching with you . The film ends with Ali G / Bond actually making it to little Jonathan's birthday baseball match ( though he is now cryptically referred to as ' little Tommy ' ) and taking loads of pleasure in proving his wife wrong . He does his own version of walking off into the sunset , complete with that unrealistic swagger , as the film fades out . Back in the offices of the TV Top Brass , all of these clueless , uptight phonies reacted to it with utter contempt . Which is understandable if you're an average guy on the street , but these dudes should KNOW when someone is pulling their leg . ' Spyz ' is obviously , deliberately a spoof . It's far to simple-minded and could only ever take place in a sexist male fantasy world . But . . . is this really THAT different from movies and TV today ? Is it really ? Sacha Baron Cohen keeps an impossibly straight face throughout . So maybe this is how the dunder-headed execs thought he was being serious . If so , it proves once again that he can always expose people for the fakes and charlatans that they are . A cruel idea of humor it may well be , but phonies always end up exposing themselves and Sacha only helps them along .
Brilliance	John Frankenheimer didn't have a lot of credibility in his last few years . His final film was the rather crap Reindeer Games , with Ben Affleck , and in 1996 he gave us the utterly terrible Island Of Doctor Moreau . However , he did do Ronin in 1998 , which makes up for absolutely everything . It is a detachment from glossy , MTV-directed , Hollywood action movies . If you want trash , like Bad Boys 2 , then this isn't for you . Ronin returns to the gritty , rustic and deadly serious actioners of the Seventies , much like Frankenheimer's own French Connection 2 . The title refers to Samurai warriors in ancient Japan who were left with no cause , or purpose , if their master was killed . They'd roam the countryside , pretending to be thieves , beggars , even madmen and hiring their skills out to the highest bidder . Much like the lost , wandering freelancers that make up our cast of characters . Robert De Niro is Sam , an ex-CIA agent ( or is he ? ) , who bands together with a ragtag group of similar ex-spies for a " no questions asked " job with what appears to be the IRA . First we have Vincent ( the wonderful Jean Reno ) , as a French agent who knows where to find just about anything you want . Spence ( Sean Bean ) is a gung-ho SAS dropout who is waaaaay out of his depth and ends up jeopardising the whole mission . Gregor ( Stellan Skarsgard ) , an ex-KGB spy who knows his gadgets and another American called Larry ( who is rather disposable ) . All of these men are led by Deirdre ( Natascha McElhone ) , a young Irish woman who answers to Seamus O'Rourke ( Jonathan Price ) , an IRA boss who is in a lot of trouble with his superiors . Still with me ? No ? Well I'm gonna continue anyway . The group's mission is to steal a metallic briefcase from the Russian Mafia . The contents of this case are a mystery ; all we know is that a lot of people are willing to pay mucho plento to get their hands on it . As if the set-up wasn't tenuous enough , there is immediately too much suspicion within the group to bear . And the already complicated plot is thrown into endless chaos as double-crosses , double-double-crosses , secrets and lies screw things up in a big , big way . It sounds tough going , but it's not really . I'll admit I didn't really like Ronin when I first saw it ( or the second or third for that matter ) , but it's one of those movies that creeps back on you . Frankenheimer's direction is so flawless and masterful that every frame of every scene flows effortlessly The acting is so well rehearsed and the cast so well chosen that even in every gesture , idiosyncrasy and subtle glance you can read into the characters's hidden motives . It takes a good number of viewings to decipher Ronin , but when the story is this well done , who cares ? Since its release there have been few action films that have come close to its intensity . Some , like Bourne Identity / Supremacy try to emulate its bleak tone , but don't match up . Supremacy has a car chase that was desperate to beat Ronin's , but is far too flashy . That's also the ace up it's sleeve . About 80 minutes into the film , the second car chase is a juggernaut of film-making . Never before and probably never again for a long , long time , has there been a car chase so completely mental . No Michael Bay 1000 cuts a second , no slow-motion , no stunts silhouetted against the sunset , just sheer , relentless adrenaline , as DeNiro and Reno tear up the streets of Paris . It's the centrepiece of the movie and a perfect example of what REAL action film-making is . Elia Cmiral's score is the other utterly perfect aspect of the movie . Simultaneously lonely , seductive and mysterious , it surely is one of the best themes ever and anyone with sense would go out and buy the soundtrack CD right away . Though most jive turkeys will disagree - with the Gator ? How dare you ! - Ronin is perfection from beginning to end , from Frankenheimer's strong , imposing direction to David Mamet's script , riddled with cryptic dialogue and double-meanings . No one can deny Ronin's importance as a real action picture . No one can watch crap like xXx , or 6 Fast 6 Furious , and claim Ronin to be a bad movie . It has enough , maybe too much , integrity and intelligence to shame anything that comes even halfway close . If you're sick of action flicks , or films in general , where the audience just sits there passively and is fed information , then Ronin is the cure . It may sound like a bizarre comparison , but it's on par with Lost Highway , as one of those movies you have to figure out in your own damn time .
A major accomplishment !	It took an infinity of imagination to make The Dark Crystal , a film so overflowing with invention that you literally have to watch it about 100 times just to take it all in . Everyone involved , from the director to the best boy gave the film such loving affection and made it the best it could possibly be . Kid's movies ( if you want to call it that ) these days simply are not what they used to be and probably never will be again . This is yet another thing that makes The Dark Crystal so damn precious . The film is set in another world , in another time in an age of wonder . It has been 999 years and 1 year since the powerful , life-giving crystal cracked and stopping shining . Since then the land has become barren and the Urskeks ( a race of God-like beings ) have split into two separate races , the peaceful Uru ' Mystics ' and the evil Skeksis-a horrific cross between bird and reptile . The three suns that shine upon the land are about to line up in a great conjunction that only happens once every 1000 years . If the crystal is not repaired before then the cruel Skeksis will rule the land forever . Jen is a Gelfling ( a sort of fairy creature ) , believed to be the last of his race . A prophecy tells of a single Gelfling defeating the Skeksis and restoring peace to the land . Raised by the Uru , Jen begins a journey to repair the crystal when the Skeksis Emperor dies ( in a truly disturbing scene ) . On his way he meets Aughra , a sort of witch creature and Kira , another Gelfling and her race of Podling people ( sort of like Fraggles ) . Though there is no specific love scene between them , there is a very nice romance developing through-out the story . Filmed in gorgeous locations across England and Scotland ( with the use of a lot of matte paintings of course ) the film really , really does take you to another world . There's not a single human in sight ( a perfect world or what ) and , with exception to the awful Skeksis , almost every creature is cute and fluffy ( such as Kira's Fizzgig ) . The production design , in particular the genius contributions by Brian Froud , is so immense and impressive that you wish you could jump through the screen and actually be there in order to appreciate it more . Trevor Jones ' breathtaking , beautiful score is among his best work ( tying with Merlin in 1998 ) and is surely some of the best film music you are ever likely to hear . Ever ! There was a limited edition of the score put on CD a few years ago but only 5000 were ever printed . It's sure to be quite expensive now but it's so goddamn worth it ! Henson , Oz and Froud teamed up again a few years later to make Labyrinth which seems to be more fondly remembered as it's not as sinister as The Dark Crystal and has human actors in it to make it more accessible to those with narrower minds . I prefer this one though ( no fruity songs , no David Bowie ! ) as it has a certain edge to it that Labyrinth lacks . An epic . A masterpiece . An unforgettable classic . The Dark Crystal is magical , mystical timeless classic . I can't recommend it enough . If only we still had movies like this . I'll take risk-taking The Dark Crystal over PC drek like The Shaggy Dog any day .
Life reflects art .	In the modern world , Exec Dec strikes closer to home than it originally intended as it eerily foreshadows and other acts of terrorism . It makes for a perfect flip-side companion piece to Paul Greengrass's little-seen United 93 . In the world of Exec Dec the heroes save the day and America wins . In United 93 ( and the real world ) life isn't that simple . But since this was made 5 years prior to it should be judged purely as entertainment and not as any political statement . Kurt Russell plays David Grant , a counter-terrorist expert who is called into the Pentagon when a group of crazed Muslim extremists taken over a flight from Athens to Washington DC . After blowing up civilians in London , they demand that their recently captured terrorist leader El Sayed Jaffa ( think O . B . L . ) be released and that they be given millions of dollars in gold bullion . Grant , suspects that this is merely a ploy to get into US airspace to set off a massive bomb rigged with huge supply of DZ-5 poison gas . Their only apparent option is to blow the plane up over the Atlantic , killing everyone on-board and sinking any evidence that they might have . But Colonel Travis ( that's Steven Seagal folks ! ) suggests hooking up the 747 with a modified Remora stealth bomber while it's still in the air so he and his commandos can kick some terrorist ass . Dragged along for the ride , Grant and computer nerd Dennis Cahill ( Oliver Platt ) are to supervise the link-up and identify Cell Leader Nagi Hassan ( David Suchet ) from the Remora . But the link-up faulters and only 4 commandos plus Grant and Cahill make it on-board . Travis is killed and the Remora is destroyed , along with most of their equipment . With only a few hours before the plane reaches US airspace and the bare-minimum of equipment the group have to sneak around in the crawlspaces of airplane attics , cargo bays and elevator shafts searching for the bomb and spying on the terrorists . It's highly intense , superbly photographed and expertly edited entertainment . What first attracted me to Exec Dec was obviously the casting of Russell and Seagal but link-up with the Remora and the 747 is definitely one of the most unique action scenes in the past decade and was the major selling point of the film for me . I do realize that Seagal has many critics and most of them judge him far , far to harshly and play up his characters death in this film claiming that the only good thing about Exec Dec is ' the death of Seagal 10 minutes into an extended cameo ' . Which is a totally foolish and untrue thing to say . Seagal is in the movie for a full 45 minutes before he dies . Which was done to shock the audience into believing that if Seagal dies then any of the cast could be next . And even if you're a Seagal hater ( understandable considering his recent poor output ) don't let that overshadow the rest of the film which is , in it's final half-hour , so exciting that you'll be so on the edge of your seat that you won't actually be sitting on it . It does lose some of it's power when compared to the horror-show that is United 93 , but like I said , they are either side of the same coin . In the world of Executive Decision the terrorist attacks of would never have happened . And if was an always inevitable event , then I guess the film IS far-fetched . But it was made pre - for entertainment , nothing else , so I guess I can forgive it for being so .
Meep Meep !	This is the very first Road Runner cartoon . Fresh and funny it was at the time , but after a while many of these toons began to resemble each other and it was impossible to tell them apart especially when they started recycling footage in the non Looney Tunes Rudy Larriva shorts of the 60s and 70s . It lessens the quality of the real Roadrunner cartoons of the time and it's a real shame considering how intelligent they were . The formula ( before it got tired ) is the same as ever . Wile E . Coyote , is a starving desert dog , there doesn't seem to be much food around other than a cheeky Roadrunner so he uses everything at his disposal ( and endless shoddy products from the Acme corporation ) to catch the bird only for his plans to backfire . Roadrunner is kind of met with a lot of criticism now with many moans of ' They are all the same ' . While this is true now , the characters were only good as long as Chuck Jones and Co were in control . This being the first of many great Roadrunner shorts before it went downhill . And I just love the sticking out tongue thing Roadrunner does .
Mayor vs Mayor	Bugs and Yosemite Sam are at their best in this brilliant cartoon which sees them fighting each other over the Mayor elections in a country town . Sam has vowed to wipe out all rabbits from the town and naturally Bugs is upset . The usual tricks and hijinks follow . But what makes them different this time is that instead of Bugs duping Sam into stupidity , Sam plays many nasty tricks on Bugs . But the bunny is so smart and so many steps ahead that he manages to reverse each and every trick back onto Sam . The comic timing is just perfect . In the end none of them win . A mare becomes mayor . Trust me it makes sense .
A Timeless classic	By having a pretty good plot , light humor and some originality here and there , this film has become a well-deserved classic . And before Eddie Murphy's ego got the better of him and before he sold himself out to family audiences . Eddie plays the brilliantly named Axel Foley , a fast-talking renegade Detroit cop . After blundering a cigarette truck set up he travels to Beverly Hills in his crappy , sky-blue , banged up Chevy Nova to solve the murder of his best friend . Very much out of place , he has to solve this mystery on his own as the ' by the book ' Beverly Hills Cops don't take him seriously . There is no macho crap here . No love interest and no other sleazy junk you find in most cop thrillers . By sticking to what it wants to do ( walking thru the plot making jokes ) it succeeds as a comedy and a thriller . Harold Faltermyer's 80's music doesn't date the film one tiny little bit .
Very good for a family movie	Most family movies seem hastily thrown together but HOUSEGUEST is an exception . The dialogue sparkles , the direction isn't just 2-takes-and-go , the cinematography is whackily speeded up in some places and the editing is rapid fire . And unlike most family movies , it lasts for 110 minutes . That's about half an hour longer than is usual . I know this hardly seems like a valid point but I reckon it proves the movie's got more content than fart jokes etc . My only gripe is the obvious McDonalds plugging about 40 minutes in . If you can just turn away for these 10 seconds then it's not so bad . It's a shame that it's there tho because it tarnishes the credibility of the movie . Sinbad is always good and the late , great Phil Hartman can make any film watchable so they really add to this brilliantly entertaining comedy . Do yourself a favour and watch it . It's not just for kids . I watched my VHS a zillion times and I was so impatient for this DVD to be released . So it's barebones , but who cares ? I'm just glad to have it . The 1 . 78 : 1 anamorphic picture is super and the Dolby 2 . 0 surround track is decent enough . After all this is a dialogue driven comedy but some sound effects and music are presented pretty well . My subwoofer even go a big kick from a gunshot near the end . Pick this one up whenever you see it . No matter what age you are , you and your kids will enjoy .
Cool , but too short	The Fatal Fury franchise is full of promises and this first animated feature takes the characters beyond the video game boundaries . It's cool how the fighters ( Terry Bogard especially ) are written as being normal and sensitive rather than always butch , evil and trying to start a fight . The characters in the Street Fighter series were too much like this but Terry Bogard always appears innocent and his adult form still looks like the child he was at the beginning . But my fave character in Fatal Fury was always Geese Howard . He is such a cool bad guy and live action bad guys should be more like him . Andy Bogard and Joe Higashi are amusing supporting characters and make great sidekicks for Terry . The ending is a little too quick but when you consider that there is a follow up and a great animated movie it ain't so bad . If you like this one then the others should give you a good fix .
One of the best shows ever .	It's just a pity it only ran for 3 years . I was only a kid then but I imagine it was one of the top rating shows . When I say that The A-Team was inventive I really mean it . Every show would have them locked in a barn or warehouse , by a corrupt Sheriff or Mayor , that just happens to be loaded with equipment of some kind . The A-Team then invent some kind of crazy machine that enables them to break out and defeat the bad guys . Not before a montage of them building the machine to a variation of the classic A-Team theme tune . Every 10th show would be about Deckard and how he wanted to catch the A-Team " for a crime they didn't commit " , but he never did . They were just too clever . The show was always critized for being too farfetch'd . It's true though . A car would be blown up and the passengers would walk out , cough and dust themselves down . . . totally unharmed . And The A-Teams uncanny ability to fashion a rocket launcher out of a pringles tube and an orange was just too much for some folks . But that's what made it so good .
An Epic , no doubt	George A . Romero's HUGE-scale sequel to Night of the Living Dead takes his simple , but scary , idea and expands from an isolated farmhouse to the whole planet . The zombies are EVERYWHERE and there is no escape . Resistance is futile . A couple of SWAT team members quickly figure this out and skip on their evacuation duties to just get out of the city in their own quicker way . Hooking up with a couple of traffic reporters in a chopper they take off in search of a safe haven . Along the way they see the world below react to the oncoming Armageddon and end of civilization . After spotting a deserted shopping mall below the quartet land on the roof and barricade themselves inside as the world very quickly crumbles . Hope is rapidly running out and much time passes with no word from what remains of the world . While not as scary as the remake , this film does make up by having a sick sense of humor and a larger story to tell . I won't pass off cheeky subtext as my own discovery ( every other review here does ) but it is quite intelligent ( if a bit dated in the present day ) . There's a lot of depth to Dawn of the Dead and it's all well thought out and planned rather than being generic and unoriginal like so many other modern horror movies . There characters ( especially Ken Foree ) are all strong and believable and react with logic and sense rather than annoying panic . It's interesting to see how normal people take on facing the end of civilization ( if not the end of the world . . . just humans ) with just simple tools and the bare minimum at their reach . The opinions over the original and remake are pretty much split . I think that both are very strong efforts at true horror and instead of regarding them as original / remake I think it's wiser to consider them as two separate stories both happening at the same time . Each film has their weaknesses and strengths . The zombies in the original are a bit too comical to be truly threatening . While in the remake they'd be on you , ripping your throat out before you can even say ' What the . . ? ' And the actual ' DAWN ' of the dead was more emphasized in the remake . Though the original has more of a true epic feel to it . Currently , the 156 minute director's cut of the original is only available in an OOP DVD from Anchor Bay . But if you hold off until September then a massive box set from AB feature 3 different cuts of the film and loads of extras will be released . This is definitely a horror classic , far above Psycho and Silence of the Lambs . True greatness . Keep a lookout for Jason make-up man Tom Savini as Blades and remember Ken Foree's chilling prophecy . . . ' When there is no more room in hell , the dead will walk the earth '
Everything the movie wasn't	In my opinion the movie didn't exist . This Animated version of the Streetfighter story is a zillion times as good . The characters are stronger and although there are quite a few of them they are all developed enough for us to sympathise / hate them . It seems as if the makers of this film paid extra attention to every area of production in order to make a film that couldn't possibly be improved upon . They almost succeeded . Unfortunately I saw the " Americanised " version of the film which replaces an awesome musical score with grunge rock music and cuts out Chun Li's nudity before her fight with Vega . Speaking of Vega , doesn't he remind of Jason Voorhees . He was definitely a cool character . They all were apart from M . Bison . He is the only fault the film has because for a central villain . He doesn't do much apart from stand statue still and say in a very deep ( that MUST make him evil ) voice that he is superior to everyone else and that they are all " weak pathetic fools " and that his henchmen must " seize them " . Boring . It is such a shame that a great movie had such a lame villain . But it's the set ( ? ) pieces that make this film stand out from other Anime movies . The fight on the wing of the plane is ultra cool . Ken Masters is just driving thru the Pacific Northwest countryside when this huge plane comes out of nowhere and he is suddenly fighting M . Bison on top of it . The final battle outside Honda's shack in the mountains is also very cool . I reckon Honda is my fave character . The ending was a little suspicion tho . Just what is the deal with that truck ? Anyways , the Streetfighter franchise knows it's full potential and I recommend that you check out all of the DVDS that are available out there .
