Santa's Enchanted Village is another of K . Gordon Murray's piece of . . . well read below	Like Santa's Magic Kingdom that I reviewed last year , this was another ineptly made children's holiday short produced by schlockmeister K . Gordon Murray and filmed on location at a Santa's Village in California and Illinois . For one thing , the narrator claims that to make Santa feel at home , each of the village made in his name has a " North Pole made of real ice " . Really ? Even in summer ? Seeing an adult in a giant Stinky the Skunk costume brings a creepy vibe especially in close-up . And don't get me started on the adult-in-a-wolf costume who complains of his ulcer to Santa ( who laughs at his expense ! ) because of his sixteen-hour work days without Stinky helping , who has an out-of-tune accordion playing whenever he walks , and tells Stinky at a children's puppet show ( which is real ineptly performed here ) how he " works his butt off for the Children of the Universe " . LOL ! And how about those teen elves who look like they've never been at a rock ' n ' roll concert ? Not to mention the repetitious marching music ( which would have been at home at a Nazi parade ) when the skunk and the elves make their toys . Those pre-teen kids sure take their time running away from Stinky during the puppet show . ( And one of them actually decides to strike a conversion with him ! ) And one more thing , the skunk's and Puss-in-Boots ' voices are really amateurishly and annoyingly banal ! Makes me wish " Mystery Sceince Theatre 3000 " was still on the air so I can hear what Joel or Mike and ' bots would comment on as this really monotonous piece of junk was unspooling in their Satellite of Love . . .
Lo , the Poor Buffalo is one of the lamest of ' 40s animation shorts	Well , if I never thought I'd see an animated cartoon short from the ' 40s that would qualify as bland and boring , that may be because I'd never seen anything from the latter Columbia / Screen Gems animation output until now with this : Lo , the Poor Buffalo . From the title character who talks and sings like Elmer Fudd ( only with a falsetto ) to the Yosemite Sam-like Buffalo Billingsly character ( with some of Foghorn Leghorn's speech patterns ) to the stereotypical cartoon American Indian , these are some of the most unappealing characters I've ever seen from cartoons made in this era . While there's plenty of good animation and some amusing gag action ( such as when three buzzards swoop down to strip a literally shot jeep or do the same to the three main characters ) there's also some lame sound effects ( such as the " pop " noises when the characters get shot " dead " ) . Since I just passed the 10-line limit , I'll just say only animation completists who are curious about these rare Columbia cartoons should check this one out at least once . Stay away , otherwise .
Polly Wants a Doctor is another illogical ' 40s cartoon from Columbia	Polly the Parrot is tired of crackers , so she goes out and sees a goat eat scrap metal or " roughage " as the goat calls it . Polly decides she wants some of that so the goat obliges . After she eats slices of a record player , the goat takes Polly's head and makes a request to someone inside the parrot's body for an upbeat song . As that record plays , Polly shakes her body and splits in two for a partner . Let me just stop right there as the rest of the cartoon doesn't really make sense . In fact , this was another entry in ThadBlog's " Saturday Bowl of WTF " as linked to YouTube that was picked from the Columbia / Screen Gems scrap heap . What I'm basically saying is while there's a couple of amusing moments like the dance scene I just described , Polly Wants a Doctor , like many of these cartoons from Columbia , just has no logic to the story despite the fine full animation throughout . Only worth a look if your a ' 40s cartoon completist .
Buddy of the Legion is another bland effort of a cartoon starring Buddy	Here's another cartoon starring Warner's blandest character : Buddy . In this one , Buddy gets hired to take care of a bookstore while the heavyset female boss leaves temporarily . When he looks at a book about the Foreign Legion , Buddy dreams he's there . . . Despite some good animation provided by Bob Clampett and Chuck Jones , this animated short feels rushed because of the limited running time of six minutes that doesn't serve whatever story you half expect when Buddy dreams of adventure while sleeping . And the time spent having the boy dusting in the bookstore isn't all that amusing . So on that note , I'd only recommend Buddy of the Legion if you're a Warner Bros . cartoon completist .
My Little Margie : Miss Whoozis is too silly to recommended	Margie is a model whose photographer keeps forgetting her name . The modeling agency she works for has her father , Vern , and his boss , Honeywell , as investors though she doesn't know that nor does her father know his daughter's whereabouts . The designer wants all his models signed to exclusive contracts but Margie , who has a crush on the photographer , works at the dept . store window with fellow model Hercules in order to make photographer jealous . A big mix-up between the designer , photographer , Vern and his boss , and Margie results . One of several episodes filmed without a laugh track , the plot contrivances really show through . So this is a mildly amusing story at best though Fritz Feld as a designer does do his trademark ' pop ' sound from his mouth in his last scene . Too silly to really recommend though an interesting curio for Feld fans .
Paul Terry's Dinner Time should provide interest for anyone into early sound cartoons	Just saw this on Cartoon Brew in the first of a series of " Brew Vault " sites . With commentary by Brew regular Jerry Beck and Mark Kausler , Dinner Time is noted as the first sound cartoon short made after Warner Bros . ' success with The Jazz Singer and produced even before Walt Disney's first sound cartoon , Steamboat Willie ( though released after ) . As noted by Beck and Kausler , Walt didn't like this cartoon thinking it was just a noise of sound effects and music . He had a point and I must add the synchronization of voices aren't perfect either as they don't match the lip-movements at all ! Also , the gags are scattershot with almost no point at all . There was one amusing gag when a dog sees his reflection in a river with the bone in his mouth as he drops that one to search for the one in the water . Ironic thing is , he actually does find another one there ! Otherwise , it's just chases between other look-alike dogs , Farmer Al Falfa , and a dogcatcher that mostly seems pointless . I just remembered another sequence with a cat and his nine lives that was also pretty amusing . So on that note , I guess for animation buffs who's interested in watching an important first , Paul Terry's Dinner Time may be worth a look .
Buddy's Day Out marks the start of a series of cartoons starring a forgotten Warner Bros . character	I just watched on DailyMotion this cartoon short from Leon Schlesinger Productions whose product was distributed by Warner Bros . It marked the first appearance of a character named Buddy . Who ? You ask . Well , when Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising left to go to M-G-M , they took Bosko with them . So Schlesinger raided the Walt Disney studio for animators and the character they created to replace Bosko was Buddy who was basically Bosko in whiteface with girlfriend Cookie , pet dog Happy , and little brother Elmer . With that all said , this cartoon has some amusing sight gags like a car going back through a fence and crashing into various animals before landing in Cookie's yard or a train that seems on its way into crashing into a car with Elmer and Happy inside when Buddy and Cookie use a ladder to derail the locomotive in another direction . Otherwise , there is some cringe-worthy spots of some little animals and insects saying , " Woogie , woogie , woogie " or variations thereof that makes the cuteness factor here really annoying . So on that note , I'd recommend Buddy's Day Out only for those really curious of what the Looney Tunes gang had to go through to eventually get to the greatness of Porky Pig , Daffy Duck , Bugs Bunny , etc .
Molly Moo-Cow and Robinson Crusoe is pretty ordinary	Molly Moo-Cow lands on an island that also has Robinson Crusoe on . Crusoe sings how he likes to be alone . He sees footprints that his thinks is some kind of trouble so he chases the tracks before he and Molly bump into each other . Molly licks his face indicating she likes him but Robinson will have none of it and chases her off the island . As Molly gets back on her raft , Crusoe encounters some natives who attempt to boil him . He calls for help so Molly rows back to shore and scares the natives out . Robinson lets her stay then asks , " But what will I do with you ? " Molly puts some mud on her face which causes Robinson to say , " Friday ! " as we iris out . Other than the singing of Crusoe and the natives , this short is pretty ordinary and that racist ending pretty much mars whatever other enjoyment you may have of this late Van Beuren cartoon short . Only worth seeing for Van Beuren enthusiasts .
Poor Little Butterfly is interesting if a bit offensive	Poor Little Butterfly depicts two Japanese sister butterflies waiting for the arrival of their boyfriends , a bug and a ( I think ) lizard with Goofy's voice ( probably Pinto Colvig ) . Goofy lizard gets the buck-tooth one . The more beautiful sister gets a ring from the bug . Goofy lizard and buck-tooth butterfly enjoy themselves flying over a candle flame . Bug and beautiful butterfly sister dance . As the boyfriends leave on their boat , sister butterflies start crying . The sadness is temporary as the boat capsizes and sisters and boyfriends are reunited . . . Some beautiful animation though I found the buck-tooth Japanese characterization a bit offensive . And I was a bit confused as I thought the sisters were humans who were in love with giant insects . Interesting and worth a look at least once for anyone curious about these obscure Columbia cartoons . I found this on YouTube .
Hataw tatay hataw is slight Filipino fluff	Being of Filipino descent , I took a chance and watched with my parents this Filipino comedy from 1994 called Hataw tatay hataw . It basically tells the story of a middle-aged bellboy whose long-lost daughter returns from the U . S . to visit her father who disguises himself as the hotel owner to impress her . Along for the ride is hotel coworker Carol and the bellboy's adopted son Boyet . There is a running gag involving a wheelchair bound customer who keeps getting in accidents with the bellboy and his coworkers . Most of the slapstick scenes I found clumsily staged but I give the filmmakers credit for even attempting them . Many familiar American songs like " Top of the World " and " We are the World " are heard in the soundtrack either instrumentally or with Filipino translation . There's also an original musical interlude with the leading ladies that plays like a music video . This was slightly an enjoyable piece of fluff that I may see again .
The Contract is below average for the talents of Morgan Freeman and John Cusack	When my dad suggested we watch this movie starring-for the first time-Morgan Freeman and John Cusack , I wondered why the title , The Contact , seemed so unfamiliar to me . Having just checked the IMDb entry , I found out it was a direct-to-DVD entry here in the U . S . Watching this I can see why with director Bruce Beresford trying to make this both a drama and a thriller and succeeding in neither . In fact , I think I would have preferred if Freeman's storyline of planning a hit with his men had been taken further with Cusack being an agent hired to take him down instead of him being a school coach with a drug-taking son who accidentally encounters Freeman being handcuffed to the agent he just shot in a forest . Oh , their exchanges aren't too bad but after that I wondered when the real fireworks would begin . What tension there is between Freeman's agents , the police , and the FBI agents is pretty entertaining but that scene near the end with Freeman threatening Alice Krige if Cusack and his son were harmed came completely out of left field for me . What's the relationship , if any , between them anyway ? There are some other things here I don't get but I don't want to discuss them here . In summation , if you're a fan of both Cusack and Freeman , The Contract is worth a look but nothing else .
Das Sandbad is an early Austrian " nudie " I discovered on the internet	Just watched this primitive silent short by Austrian Johann Schwarzer on the Europa Film Treasures blog . It's basically a depiction of a clothed man with his naked lady friend , who's wearing just a towel , coming to a sandy place with the woman lying there nude with all her parts to see just before the man comes back to pour sand on her legs and her body . That's it and compared to what is filmed today , it's nothing to really get excited about but since this was made when movies were something fresh to countries outside America , it's fascinating to wonder what the Austrian males were thinking while watching this ( of course , it's not hard to imagine what they were thinking , still , they probably weren't as perverted as we probably would be now with the more explicit images ) . On that note , Das Sandbad is worth a look .
Lucky You is an uneven drama about poker	Spider-Man 3 was sold out so my friend and I chose to see Lucky You . The main story was between Eric Bana and Robert Duvall who plays Bana's father . They're both card playing gamblers who have an intense rivalry both inside and out of the poker table . Theirs are the most interesting scenes . Drew Barrymore as Bana's potential girlfriend is only partially effective . Other supporting players include Debra Messing as Barrymore's sister , Horatio Sanz as a guy who bets a golf game with Eric , Robert Downey Jr . , Charles Martin Smith , and , as the only female in the high stakes " World Series " poker tournament in the end , Jean Smart . Interesting depiction of card playing but very uneven as a drama , in fact I almost fell asleep a couple of times . . .
Alvin and the Chipmunks was an okay live-action update on ' 50s cartoon characters	After a month of purposely deciding NOT to watch this movie , I finally decided to humor my friend and see this update on Ross Bagdasarian , Snr . ' s , creations from fifty years ago . There were pretty funny scenes when they surprised Dave in the beginning and a hilarious one when their manager , Ian ( David Cross ) , gave each of them a caffeinated iced drink to give them energy . Other than that , this was a mostly by-the-numbers story of the pressures of success and the toll it takes on your health . In fact , the climatic scene when the rodent music group is revealed to be lip-syncing to their own vocals ( because of their now-hoarse voices ) seems aimed at those who go for such acts like Britney Spears and Ashlee Simpson instead of real musicians who play genuine music ( though I don't consider what David Seville-Jason Lee-had auditioned initially for Ian authentic either ) . It's obvious that Lee ( " My Name Is Earl " ) and Cross ( " Arrested Development " ) took these roles for a large paycheck though Lee , at least , grows on you after a while . The music performances of the Chipmunks themselves are variable depending on whether you like any of the songs they sing here or the way their voices completely dominate though I admit liking their performance of " Only You " , " Funkytown " , and , of course , " The Chipmunk Song " , and even the updated version of " Witch Doctor " ( though I prefer the original recordings ) . Not bad for a reboot though for my money , I think I'd love to see the original version for television from the ' 50s , " The Alvin Show " . P . S . What a treat to see the original album covers of The Chipmunks over the years during the end credits .
Halloween is a Toby the Pup cartoon that had an imperfect transfer on YouTube	Originally written / 07-Halloween is a weird Toby the Pup cartoon from the Charles Mintz studio . Unfortunately , what I saw on YouTube was a technical mess . First off , the soundtrack somehow went ahead of some of the frames . Then for the last 3 or so minutes , there is no sound . So it's hard for me to be real objective in this review of the cartoon . There are certainly many wonderfully weird scenes that would be typical of such cartoons from the ' 30s such the cow peeling a candle like a banana , or his eating an apple with a worm in it while the worm's taking a bath and pulls down an asbestos curtain ! Or three bird skeletons drinking with the largest one taking a first try at the punch as the liquid falls outside his neck letting the second middle sized one drink from that with the same thing happening to him as the smallest one drinks from that . . . There's also some piano playing by Toby and a little girl scolding singing , " Smarty , Smarty , Smarty " . Largely based on what I've seen from the imperfect YouTube linkage , I give this one a 2 . Maybe I'll up it if I ever see a better transfer . Update / 08-I've just seen the complete version ( Thanks , Thadblog ! ) , it's even more weirder with the " smarty " girl getting spanked by a man dressed in a toga , and Toby scaring all the ghosts by simply saying " cock-a-doodle-doo " like a rooster ! Then there's a little ghost calling him " Daddy " ! Okay , since I've now seen the whole thing clearly , I'm now giving this a 5 .
When the Midnight Choo-Choo Leaves for Alabam ' is interesting early sound Song Cartune	The version of this Max Fleischer Song Cartune I saw on Google Video ended when the song did so there was no final gag animation that I'm used to seeing on others made during the ' 30s . The only animation I saw here was when the conductor said , " All aboard ! " with a long line of passengers quickly filing in . Then one late passenger opens the conductor like a door before the song starts . I'm guessing the recording used during this pre-Jazz Singer short was the actual recording played in some theatres that were getting wired for sound for this and other experimental sound Song Cartunes Fleischer was making at the time . The synchronization with the singer and the bouncing ball is not perfect but I guess since this was indeed an experimental undertaking that can be excused . Certainly worth seeing once for any Fleischer completists out there .
Swing Social is entertaining if a little politically incorrect	In this politically incorrect cartoon from 1940 , a black preacher on Sunday has caught a black fisherman not going to church . He then tells of why black fish don't bite on the sabbath as we are treated to a musical sequence of Negro fish singing about the devil and what he represents and how to defeat him . I suppose one should be relieved that the human black characters are only seen from the neck down though there's still some of the mangled English dialect to deal with . The music is for the most part entertaining and mostly avoids stereotyping ( brief fried chicken sequence notwithstanding ) . Certainly worth seeing for anyone who loves swing music and loves all ' 30s and ' 40s animation styles . Directed by Rudolf Ising who previously created Bosko with Hugh Harmon .
Small Town Sheriff is interesting for some weird images that appear in this Paul Terry cartoon	This was one of Paul Terry's Aesop Fables cartoons he made during the silent era . In this one , Farmer Al Falfa's car breaks down while a cat in a speakeasy is selling alcoholic beverages to a mouse ( who quickly passes out ) and an elephant ( whose mouth goes on fire which the cat douses with his seltzer bottle while the trunk sprays that seltzer back on the cat ! ) . After the farmer takes his sip , he starts hallucinating like crazy . . . Having seen this twice on YouTube , this rare silent cartoon is interesting for some of the weird images that pervade during the last three minutes of this cartoon . As for the title , well , all I'll say is that reveal comes at the end . So on that note , if you're interested in many of these vintage and obscure silent cartoons , I say Small Town Sheriff is worth a look .
At One View is interesting if a bit pretentious	At One View is one of two shorts in Volume 5 of The International Tournee of Animation directed by Paul De Nooijer . The other one is I Should See . Two men are sitting in a chair reading newspapers . Then , through stop-motion photography , we see the chairs moving with the men still sitting down . The men stop to face us . They are now showing photos of each others faces in front of their own . The photos are now moving , again through stop-motion photography . Then we see slides of these photos shuffling automatically . This and the other scenes mentioned above continues for about 5 minutes . Then , at the end , the narrator , who's been speaking all this time , mentions how photography is basically trickery as we see the two men disappear in thin air . The end . Interesting if a bit pretentious , At One View is certainly worth seeing once as an experiment in stop-motion .
The Mark of the Hawk was a rare early Poitier performance	After months of keeping this on my DVD disc having taped it from the Family Net channel , I finally watched this rare Sidney Poitier movie a few hours ago . Taking place in Africa , Mr . Poitier plays a man recently elected to the legislature that had been previously white dominated . His brother , a radical activist , thinks Obam ( Sidney's role ) has sold out since that legislature hasn't been very sympathetic to the black cause of freedom there . It takes some convincing from wife Eartha Kitt , preacher Juano Hernandez , and white outsider John McIntire to keep Obam from completely surrendering to the more violent ways of the Communist-inspired cause of his brother though some of the British whites have their own racist agenda to fulfill . McIntire himself tells how he dealt with the takeover of China and how his adopted Asian son was affected . Poitier , as usual , has great presence throughout and seeing him with the other influential black actor in film at the time , Hernandez , seems inspiring here . I'm not sure how effective this movie was though it certainly made me think about how religion often plays a role in various movements . And how nice was it to hear Ms . Kitt , in her first starring picture , sing one of her hits near the end . So on that note , The Mark of the Hawk is certainly worth seeing once if you're a Poitier fan or one interested in Africa during the late ' 50s . P . S . In citing anyone who came from my birth town of Chicago , the woman who played McIntire's wife , Helen Horton , came from there .
Silver Blaze is a pretty entertaining Wontner-Holmes movie	This is the second Arthur Wontner-Sherlock Holmes movie I saw on a two-sided dollar DVD ( The first was The Sign of Four ) . Silver Blaze has Holmes and Watson ( Ian Fleming , no not THAT one ! ) visiting the Baskerville house to spend a little holiday there . The title character is a horse that a bookie doesn't want to win since he'll lose his shirt if that horse finishes first . Holmes ' nemesis Prof . Moriarty ( Lyn Harding ) , for a certain amount , will make sure that won't happen . A bit talky for my tastes until the end when Watson gets . . . Well , I'll just leave it to anyone who reads this to seek this movie out . The print I saw was a little better looking than The Sign of Four though it still could have used some improvements . Well worth seeing for any Holmes fans or even those who love ' 30s British pictures .
Burns and Allen make their film debut in the amusing Lambchops	This being the film debut of the comedy team of George Burns and Gracie Allen , it's fascinating to watch a vaudeville act that had been formed just a few years earlier provide their pretty amusing banter that they use here to fill seven minutes . Among the many amusements from them : George - " What man in the army has the biggest hat ? " Gracie - " The one with the biggest head . " or George - " What sings with four legs ? " Gracie - " Two canaries . " George , tired of having Gracie steal his punchlines then asks and answers , " What gives more milk than a cow ? Two cows ! " They also go into a song and dance routine with more amusing patter before they realize they have a few more time to fill . If you're familiar with Burns and Allen , you can probably guess what happens . So on that note , I recommend Lambchops for anyone interested in these vintage shorts .
Shock is worthy of interest for Vincent Price fans	This movie , Shock , is noted by one thing : It's Vincent Price's first starring role after years in compelling supporting parts for 20th Century Fox . Here , he plays a psychiatrist whose murder of his wife is witnessed by a young woman ( Anabel Shaw ) across another hotel window as she waits for her returning soldier husband to come soon . The woman fainted from shock when the killing happened so when Price becomes her doctor , he and his mistress nurse ( Lynn Bari ) , try to fix it so everyone would be convinced she's crazy . I'll stop there and just say this is such a subtle suspense thriller that anyone expecting the kind of shocks today's horror / suspense fans get would be very disappointed in this one . Since this was made early in Price's career , his character has something of a conscience here . In fact , Ms . Bari steals her scenes from him as something of a Lady McBeth character . Ms . Shaw is also good in her constant frightfulness as she struggles to be heard and believed . By comparison , Frank Latimore as Shaw's husband is simply adequate as someone constantly trying to see his wife . Price himself handles his part capably . Also worth mentioning are John Davidson ( not to be confused with the singer who once co-hosted " That's Incredible " ) as crazy mental patient , Mr . Edwards , ( Loved the lightning sequence that involves him ) and Reed Hadley as D . A . O'Neill who's questioning of Price's Dr . Richard Cross threatens to drive Cross over the edge . I'd also like to note that the voice of Mrs . Cross , Ruth Clifford , was also that of Minnie Mouse at this time . While she's not noted on the DVD audio track by John Stanley , many of the leading and supporting players are of their lives , interests , and other roles . Not great but pretty good for anyone who's a fan of Vincent Price .
The List is another exciting episode of " Bionic Woman "	In this episode , Jamie is assigned to Paris with a CIA operative . Jonas lets her pick Tom from her last assignment to be her partner . They continue their flirting in the French city just before Tom gets in big trouble . Jamie gets pulled before she can rescue him but once again gets Jonas to cooperate . Jonas himself gets a call from Jamie's younger sister Becca as she gets in trouble with the police having just left a potential boyfriend caught with another girl at a party . . . Once again , some of the fun that wasn't in previous episodes is in this one mostly due to the banter between Jamie and Tom . Miquel Ferrer is also more of a benevolent figure here in the way he treats Jamie and Becca . While the backstory of the caper didn't interest me that much , I loved the gradual quick chases that made this episode so much exciting . Can't wait for the next episode so until then . . .
A Cartoonist's Nightmare was an amusing early Warner Bros . cartoon	Just found this rare Warner Bros . - Looney Tunes cartoon on YouTube . " Supervised " by ex-Disney animator Jack King ( though he'd later return there as the new resident Donald Duck helmer ) , A Cartoonist's Nightmare is one of the few that starred a now-forgotten character named Beans the Cat who was first seen in Friz Freling's color Merrie Melodies short , I Haven't Got a Hat , which also introduced Porky Pig . In this one , with all the other animators having gone home , one particular cartoonist stays on trying to finish his drawings on time . As he draws bars on Beans to protect him from a monster , the animator goes to sleep and dreams of getting attacked by other villains he created . It's up to Beans to rescue him . . . Lots of clever creative ways of drawing and erasing escapes abound here and while nothing hilarious happens , I was constantly amused at this early version of Duck Amuck that Chuck Jones made with Daffy Duck 18 years later ! On that note , I recommend this for any Warner cartoon completists out there .
The List is another pretty good episode of " Miss Guided "	After counseling a female student who had a botched nose job to wear a hat so she wouldn't get noticed on her face so much , Becky finds out that face was exposed on a blog called " Lindsey Lopez " and that she's # 18 on most doable teachers . ( Rival Lisa is # 1 and hey , what's guidance counselor Becky doing there anyway ? ) To up her ranking , Becky dresses a little more attractively the next day but after looking at herself in Principal Huffy's mirror-like car window , Huffy himself opens the door which hits Becky and gives her a broken neck after she falls . Despite that , she still shows up at the car wash that Tim sponsored for his Spanish class hoping to show up Lisa and her cheerleader students . It's while cleaning the inside of one car that a male student takes her picture . When she looks it up on the Lopez blog , she finds out why she's now # 1 : she's shown " commando " ! At least some good came from it : the botched nose girl now feels better since Becky didn't let the thing bother her ( if only she knew the truth ! ) . Oh , and during most of what I've chronicled , vice principal Terry has been searching for Lindsey Lopez ' identity because of a wrestling photo of him and another that ID's him as gay . When he finds out who the person is , he makes him show his CD photos that prove otherwise . When we see them , the opposite seems to be the case . . . This was a pretty amusing episode that showcased the quirky talents of Judy Greer and Chris Parnell to the fullest . Some might question why they act the way they do here but I say , just watch and enjoy . Though I half wonder why Becky wasn't wise enough to cover her bottom during that particular day . . .
1958 film version of South Pacific is a fine addition to R & H canon	Having taped this off HBO nearly 22 years ago , I finally got to see the 1958 version of Rodgers and Hammerstein's South Pacific just now ( I had also seen the PBS Great Performances Carnegie Hall version with Reba McEntire , Brian Stokes Mitchell , and Alec Baldwin last year ) . Mostly wonderful film version although I agree with most posters that the color filters during the songs can be a little distracting . Mitzi Gaynor is fine as Nurse Nellie Forbush in singing , dancing , and especially acting that I don't understand the criticism against her . Rossano Brazzi is likewise ( although his singing , like the other cast members , was dubbed ) as paramour Emile de Becque . John Kerr does indeed seem stilted and the dubbed singing of him is so obvious and I can't believe completely his love for France Nuyen . Ms . Nuyen is luminous , by the way . Juanita Hall and Ray Walston ( who I first encountered as Mr . Hand in Fast Times at Ridgemount High ) also lend fine support . That all said , this is classic R & H all the way in line with The Sound of Music , The King and I , Oklahoma ! , and Carousel . P . S . Thurl Ravenscroft was the singing voice of Stewpot in the " There is Nothing Like a Dame " number . You might know him best as Tony the tiger and the singer of " You're a Mean One , Mr . Grinch " in How the Grinch Who Stole Christmas .
This early Disney version of Cinderella is worth a look for his fans	Nearly 28 years before making the classic feature-length animated version of Cinderella , Walt Disney made a short 7-minute version for the Laugh-O-Grams studio in Kansas City . In this one , the title character is doing dishes with her cat while her stepsisters are lying around reading the papers ( there is no evil stepmother here ) . I better mention that this takes place in the ' 20s with flappers and cars . Meanwhile , the prince is out hunting for bears ( in this sequence , the bears are dancing just before the prince ties them up in one rope ! ) . After he sends his cat with the invitations , that cat gets a little injured but when someone asks if he's all right , he hits him with his stilt ! After the stepsisters leave Cinderella and the cat alone in the house , the fairy godmother gets them a car with a flapper dress for the girl . If you know the story you can probably guess what happens at this point on . I will also mention that Cinderella and the prince look similar to the characters in the first cartoon Disney made , Little Red Riding Hood . The animation here is actually an improvement from his first two that I saw on YouTube . So on that note , I highly recommend this first version of the famous fairy tale made by the legendary Walt Disney .
Hey , Hey Fever is a pretty entertaining initial Bosko outing for M-G-M	Just discovered this on the Misce-Looney-ous blog which usually posts shorts and other film and TV spots related to the Warner Bros . cartoons and characters . This M-G-M cartoon short was included because it was the first that featured a former Warner character named Bosko . He was the creation of Hugh Harmon and Rudolf Ising who took him with them when Leon Schlesinger wouldn't increase the budget of their animated shorts . Not only is this the first Bosko to be introduced by Leo the Lion but it's also the first time he's seen in color . Having said all that , I'd like to say that while this isn't a particularly funny effort , Hey , Hey Fever does entertain with the original way the leading character and various Mother Goose ones sing about overcoming the Depression blues . For that reason , I highly recommend this to any animation buff especially any Warner and M-G-M completist out there .
Oliver Hardy provides good support to Larry Semon in The Sawmill	I found this short , The Sawmill , on a Platinum DVD collection of Laurel and Hardy shorts . It stars Larry Semon as one of the workers . Oliver Hardy plays the foreman and chief tormentor of Semon who shares with him a rivalry for the owner's daughter's hand . Unlike the Laurel and Hardy classic Busy Bodies , not all gags take place in a sawmill , some also take place in the owner's house involving a dog and some dynamite . There are also gags involving logs , paint , falling off roofs , and water . All are perfectly executed . There's a cartoonish atmosphere that's infectious here and that would eventually serve Hardy's later partnership with Stan Laurel well . For fans of Laurel and Hardy , this is well worth seeking out !
A Gentleman Always Leads is another funny episode of " Back to You "	As Chuck waits for a ride on an elevator at his hotel , he meets a couple of network news guys who are having a meeting at Carnegie Hall . They complement him for getting back his anchor job at his old stomping grounds before parting as Chuck goes to his ride . Once the elevator goes back up , those same guys come on and Chuck overhears what they really think of him : They think he's reached bottom . So Chuck becomes determined to scoop Kelly on the top story that evening . Meanwhile , Montana's intern spends too much time with Marsh . Marsh resolves to get a new one for her . He turns out to be a very old man . . . The one-upmanship is pretty hilarious between Chuck and Kelly . Kelly's line about the dingoes especially made me laugh . And wait till you hear the voice of the camping victim on the live newscast ! The intern subplot was mildly amusing though it's nice to see Bill Macy as the old man . By the way , where's Gary ? Better episode than last weeks , though the show could see some more improvement . Glad Fox is still sticking to it !
Zenobia is a mostly entertaining Oliver Hardy vehicle with Harry Langdon in fine support	Since this is Black History Month and I'm reviewing African-Americans on film in mostly chronological order , let's start my review of Zenobia by mentioning three of the players : Stepin Fetchit , Hattie McDaniel , and Philip Hurlic . Stepin ( spelled Step'n in the credits ) is Zero-the butler . He's quite funny with his talking under his breath about his thoughts every time he gets ordered . Having seen quite a few of his performances now , I have tolerated his presence a bit more because of some of the subtle brightness he brings to his parts . Hattie ( whose last name has an ' s ' added in the credits ) brings the same commanding presence that I last saw in Show Boat , which I just watched this morning . And Philip , the kid here that I just saw in The Green Pastures , as Zeke proves to be the most intelligent one in the movie when he recites The Declaration of Independence with the reward being a quarter from Oliver Hardy's character of Dr . Tibbett . They all were fine performances here despite some of the stereotypes they're forced to play . Now , with Hardy briefly split from Stan Laurel ( because of the latter's dispute with Hal Roach ) , he's the carrier of this movie and he does just fine especially in his scenes with Harry Langdon and an elephant , Zenobia , that Langdon-as Professor McCrackle-owns . Those scenes are the most " Laurel and Hardy " - like in the film . Also in fine form were Billie Burke as Hardy's wife , Bessie Tibbett , Olin Howard as Attorney Culpepper , and J . Farrell McDonald , another supporting player from my favorite movie-It's a Wonderful Life ( he played the old man whose tree was hit by George Bailey's car ) , as the Judge . One other note : Jean Parker who plays Hardy's daughter Mary Tibbett here , would later in the year play his potential fiancée in The Flying Deuces which marked Laurel and Hardy's re-teaming . So on that note , I highly recommend Zenobia . Oh , and having just seen the Hall Johnson Choir in The Green Pastures , it's nice hearing them here too .
Sittin ' on a Backyard Fence was another Schlesinger Merrie Melodies short from the early Warner Bros . cartoon years	This was a Merrie Melodies cartoon short from Leon Schlesinger incorporating a song owned by the Warner Bros . publishing company with its title being the one here . It involves a couple of male cats fighting for the love of one female feline . Loved scenes of the cats ' skeletons appearing when they cross a full moon , some sequences involving a rolling pin and telephone wires , the male cats ' fight with a bulldog , and the final scene . This early short was directed by Earl Duvall who helmed some bland Buddy cartoons after Harmon-Ising left Schlesinger and took Bosko with them to M-G-M . Worth a look for animation buffs , this was on Daily Motion .
The Wrong Type is hilarious	A lady comes to Supertemps applying for a job . The Supertemps lady , Roxanne , asks if she can type . " A bit . " comes the reply . Roxanne tests her on the typewriter . The lady typist can't find the ON button before she starts and by the time she finds it , types the letter T , and uses liquid paper on it , times up . Roxanne lies to potential employer about typing " 45 words per minute " for the woman . The woman accepts but has trouble keeping up with typing instructional recording on headphones and forgets to take them off when Roxanne calls . The boss dictates letter which the woman has trouble keeping up with and can't find file the boss wants her to put letter in . Roxanne calls again to ask how she's doing and she says not fine so Roxanne tells her to take lunch and never come back . The lady looks up boss from outside and waves goodbye even though boss is not looking . " That'll show him . " she says . The end . Although what I describe doesn't sound like much , this was a very funny short about a woman's inability to even slightly improve at her assigned job . Plus the overly enthusiastic Roxanne is hilarious in her British accent ! A worthy entry in Volume 5 of The International Tournee of Animation from 1992 .
Silly Viva Las Vegas showcase Elvis and Ann-Margret to great effect	Of all the lightweight musical movies Elvis Presley would make throughout the ' 60s , Viva Las Vegas is possibly be the most tolerable of a very silly group that became more ridiculous as the decade wore on . The plot has Elvis playing a race car driver named Lucky falling for swim instructor Rusty played by Ann-Margret who more than proves herself Presley's equal as his co-star compared to Elvis ' previous and subsequent leading ladies . Together they're dynamite whenever they dance close to each other side-by-side . Besides the title number and some of their duets , I especially enjoyed Rusty's " My Rival " about her jealousy over Lucky's car and the " What'd I Say " number with some other dancers ' moves highlighting the sequence . There's also a very exciting car race climaxing the picture . With the exception of William Demarest who I fondly remember as Uncle Charlie on " My Three Sons " , the supporting cast isn't all that compelling . But with veteran movie musical director George Sidney ( Anchors Away , 1951 Show Boat , Bye Bye Birdie ) at the helm , Viva Las Vegas becomes the kind of movie starring Elvis Presley singing that feels like a real musical as opposed to a comedy or drama with Presley songs put in for showcase purposes ( though that's sometimes the case here too ) . Final note : With the chemistry they displayed on-screen together , it's no wonder Elvis ' young girlfriend , Priscilla , got jealous whenever she read about him and Ann-Margret !
Ol ' King Cotton was my first look at singer George Dewey Washington	Having just discovered this obscure singer named George Dewey Washington on Ol ' King Cotton from a series of shorts compiled for the DVD " Hollywood Rhythm , Vol . 1 : The Best of Jazz & Blues " , I must say he's a fine singer ! The first part takes place in his yard near a shack in the South as he sings a song that seems inspired by Kern & Hammerstein's " Ol ' Man River " which I think is the title song . After his wife sends him away to a delivery job on a train , we see him there talking with his co-workers about the South and how much he misses it . He then sings about levees breaking and the sun shining afterwards that made me think he could've been referring to Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans but was possibly actually singing about the Louisiana flood in 1927 . The short ends back where we started before the fade out . Largely because of the singing , I found this pretty entertaining .
Plastilinovaya vorona segment I saw was charming	Just saw the last 4 minutes of this Russian clay-animated short from Alesandr Tatarskiy on YouTube . In this one , Russian folk singers sing about a cow , or a crow , or a dog getting watermelon . There's also a fox , or an ostrich , or a sweeper running some track race . And the moral is something about don't sing or dance under a construction site . You also hear some kids adding their own interpretations . I guess this was one of those make-it-up-as-it-goes songs that made it into this charming short that I hope to see the rest of real soon . Thanks to whoever shared this on YouTube . That site is the best place to see many of these unique animation shorts . And there's lots of Russian animation to see there !
The Big No Sleep is the second-to-last episode of Andy Barker P . I .	This is one of the two last episodes of Andy Barker P . I . that aired on April 14 , 2007 on a Saturday . After constantly getting dunked in a water tank at a carnival , Andy and his wife Jenny have trouble sleeping because their little daughter Molly has lost her stuffed toy elephant , Snowball . At work , Lew has Barker on a case to find a woman with a cane who her stepdaughter suspects is having an affair . Turns out the stepmother has also faked her illness . . . Very amusing , occasionally hilarious episode with the way Lew surprises Andy while he dresses or Simon's leading Barker to someone who can sell Snowball who turns out to be a drug dealer with " snowball " being cocaine . Nice cameo by Jesse L . Martin as his " Law and Order " character and , yes , that's former " Suddenly Susan " star who's now on " Lost " player , Nestor Carbonell as the adulterous doctor . One more episode of this lamented short-lived series to go .
The One with the Cast of " Night Court " was a good , if not great , episode of " 30 Rock "	" This is the reunion of friends . . . from ' Night Court ' " . So says Kenneth as the three former cast members-Harry Anderson , Markie Post , and Charlie Robinson ( with no-show John Larroquette unable to adjust his schedule ) - stage the finale wedding between Harry and Christine that never came ( perhaps because Jenna's werewolf lawyer character caused the show to " Jump the Shark " ) . Elsewhere , that " Friend " that's on this ep is Jennifer Anniston who's Liz and Jenna's old " Fatal Attraction " roommate who has designs on Jack . Not as funny as the last two episodes especially since the Anniston plot seemed a little overdone but still enjoyable nonetheless and I did like it when Claire ( Jen's character ) suggested a threesome and Jack had to consult Liz before refusing it . Seeing Ms . Post complaining about not getting Emmy nominations because of her hotness was perhaps the best thing about this episode along with Tracy mentioning to Kenneth about how there would be an audience laughing when the cast from the former 8 : 30 pm CST on Thursday show ( which " 30 Rock " now inhabits ) leaves in a huff as they wait for the reaction in silence . Hope the next with Steve Martin is better . . .
This " Colgate Comedy Hour " was a pretty entertaining summer edition	On this " Colgate Summer Comedy Hour " , after Don Wilson announces the night's cast lineup , comic Gene Sheldon ( in pantomime for the whole show ) wakes up in bed on stage in a spotlight which he puts out with a slingshot . Then singer Connie Russell warbles " One Arabian Night " in a harem outfit with appropriate backup from the Nita Bieber Dancers . After another bit from Sheldon ( who keeps reappearing in a running gag with a banjo throughout ) , Don Wilson appears on stage to introduce stand-up Jay Lawrence who reads a Variety review of himself from two weeks before on the show that's not too flattering . He then does a British announcer with mumbled words . Then he impersonates a swimmer trying to break a record on the English Channel . Then The Gaylords sing about a shoemaker . Then The Will Maston Trio appear tap dancing with first Sammy Davis , Sr . and then Maston himself doing solos before Sammy Davis , Jr . sings " Because of You " imitating four ( although he says five ) vocalists : Nat King Cole , Tony Bennett , Vaughn Monroe , and Billy Eckstine . He then impersonates James Cagney , James Stewart , Cary Grant , himself , and Jerry Lewis before playing some drums . Then Connie Russell returns singing " You've Changed " . Then Gene Sheldon plays his banjo and has some further trouble with the spotlight . Sammy Davis , Jr . then returns singing " Hey You " before The Gaylords come back with " I Love You " . Then Don Wilson gets interrupted by Sheldon ( with Davis on drums ) starring at him after which Davis dances and sings " The Birth of the Blues " with his father and Uncle Will watching on stage and the Nita Bieber Dancers performing with him . Then after Gene pulls the rest of the night's cast and Connie sings one more song , it's good night from Hollywood . . . No host dominated from this late summer broadcast from 1954 but the lion's share of air time seems to come from the one whose star rose the highest here : Sammy Davis , Jr . He's in fine form throughout from his singing to his impressions to his drum playing to his dancing . If Mr . Sheldon seems familiar to you , you've probably seen him in such Disney projects like " Zorro " or Babes in Toyland with Ed Wynn and Annette Funicello . He's just a little amusing here . Special Guest Connie Russell , which probably made her the main attraction here , displays her feminine charms in abundance especially in the beginning number . Jay Lawrence is pretty funny though some of his material may be dated . The Gaylords were also entertainingly amusing especially when they warbled in other languages . And it's nice to see Don Wilson outside of his regular gig on " The Jack Benny Program " . All in all , this was a reasonably entertaining live program from the ' 50s .
Happy Birthday Elton ! makes a fine 60th celebration for the Rocket Man	Broadcasted on MyNetworkTV on April 5 , this 60th birthday celebration for Sir Elton John was a mostly enjoyable concert special that showcased some of his best hits from the last nearly 40 years from " I'm Still Standing " to " How Wonderful Life Feels " . When Robin Williams introduces him , he amusingly says Elton made " Liberace look Amish ! " You also see plenty of British and American celebrities say their own tributes on air . I loved the animated one contributed by Bette Midler . Near the end are stills of John in some of his most outrageous outfits including his famous Donald Duck suit . Many celebrities were in the audience including a stunning appearance of Anne Hathaway . Also stunning : Lily Allen in the tribute comments section . Happy belated birthday , Sir Elton ! Hope you have many more as enjoyable as this ! P . S . John's longtime songwriting partner Bernie Taupin also wishes Sir Elton Happy Birthday on stage and appears on the tributes .
Crosby , Columbo , and Vallee was another Harmon-Ising Merrie Melodies cartoon that was pretty entertaining	Just watched this Harmon-Ising Merrie Melodies cartoon for producer Leon Schlesinger in association with Warner Bros . on YouTube . It's basically a musical one with American Indians ( or Native Americans if you want to be PC ) singing the title song as to what the public was crazy about music-wise during this period . Nice dancing movements abound and there are some amusing gags near the end concerning fire , trees , birds , and the way the fire gets put out . There are also uncanny impersonations of Crosby and Vallee . So on that note , this cartoon is worth a look . P . S . Since this was the early ' 30s , the familiar Warner Bros . cartoon characters like Porky Pig , Bugs Bunny , and Daffy Duck have yet to be created . If the animal character designs seem a little close to what the Walt Disney animation looked like at the time , that's because Hugh Harmon and Rudy Ising had originally worked for Uncle Walt in the ' 20s before leaving just as a certain mouse made Walt famous . . .
Wife and Auto Trouble is another Mack Sennett short featuring a young Mae Busch	Wife and Auto Trouble is the now old hat story of a meek man , his wife and mother-in-law , his brother-in-law , and the secretary he's having an affair with . It was a nice surprise seeing Mae Busch , long before her appearances with Laurel and Hardy , playing the secretary . Dig her jumping several feet in the air when the mother-in-law and wife appear in the office ! There's also some hilarious shooting involving all the main characters there ! Then there's the chase involving the Tri-Stone Cops ( formerly Keystone Kops ) that brings everything to an exciting climax and you have the typical Mack Sennett flourish . Another highly amusing effort worth seeing for silent movie buffs .
Bottles is a little amusingly atmospheric musical cartoon short	At a little over ten minutes , Harmon and Ising's Bottles is one of the longest one-reel cartoon shorts I've seen from the ' 30s . It's basically about a druggist who's up overnight mixing a potion for a poison bottle . As he falls asleep on the counter , the bottle comes to life and pours some of its liquid on the druggist's neck as he shrinks to a small size and wakes up . It's here that things get surreal with various medicine and alcohol bottles that come to life and sing and dance with the druggist joining in . Prominent among them are three baby bottles with diapers singing about doing nothing but crying because " no one will change our di-di " . Quite amusing and a little bit atmospheric . Worth seeing for anyone curious about MGM cartoons before Tex Avery and Tom and Jerry came aboard .
Heavy Metal is another pretty compelling episode of " Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles "	After a month of writing reviews of movies and / or TV shows relating to Black History Month , this is my first attempt to go back to the current TV season starting with the fourth episode of " Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles " . In this one , John goes off on his own in finding out about these future cyborgs with Sarah and Cameron following close behind . And the FBI agent and his partner come closer in finding out about their own case involving these killers . . . It took a while but I'm starting to understand what's going on as the series continues finding its own path . Plenty of suspense and some witty lines abound ( loved Sarah's " Please shut up . " after Cameron thanks her for one of Sarah's sarcastic observations ) . There's also some cool action from Sarah as she knocks the hell out of one guy and John seems calm here except at the end when his hand is shaking . Probably could have used some more action but next week's preview looks promising . So until next time . . .
Third episode is another charming one for " The Big Bang Theory "	After playing some computer games with his friends , Leonard overhears his crush , Penny , giggling outside . Turns out she's kissing a guy which Leonard finds out about when he brings her mail which he stole earlier . Since Penny's with someone , Leonard tries to make a move on a female lab partner named Leslie ( Sara Gilbert , a former co-star of Johnny Galecki's on " Roseanne " ) . Nothing there , so now Leonard tells Sheldon his feelings of Penny rejecting him . Sheldon points out that Leonard never asked Penny for a date . So Leonard asks Penny , after she reveals she dumped her guy , for dinner which Penny thinks is with his friends . Although the dinner is awkward , they do make small talk and all seems to go well until Leonard hits his head under the table and asks Penny if that's ketchup she sees on the floor . Back home , Penny says goodbye unaware she and Leonard had their first date while Leonard tells his friends how " great " it was . . . Plenty of pretty funny lines especially Sheldon's . Amusing brief appearance by Ms . Gilbert . A short interlude in an older singles dance class is a highlight . Hope " The Big Band Theory " did better ratings-wise this week . Will post again next week . . .
Siren of the Tropics marks Josephine Baker's starring feature debut	If you watch Siren of the Tropics with the mindset of the 21st century , try not to pay too much attention to the melodramatic plot about a tycoon trying to keep his daughter from marrying someone he doesn't think worthy of her . This seems to be an excuse to send the daughter's suitor to a faraway jungle to search for jewelry in order to prove the daughter's worth . It is here that we meet Papitou , Josephine Baker's character , who falls for the suitor after saving his life . Papitou follows the suitor back to France and is spotted by some theatrical agents dancing with orphan children . They decide to form a show with her but she won't perform unless she is promised to see the suitor . They call the suitor's potential father-in-law to arrange a meeting . Since the potential father-in-law knows what would happen if his daughter sees Papitou embrace her husband-to-be , he agrees . If you've seen some dramas involving mixed races made before the 1970s , you may be surprised by what happens here . The main reason to see this is to marvel at Ms . Baker's Charleston dance at the end . If you're interested in seeing early African-American film performances , especially Josephine Baker's , this one is definitely worth seeking out !
Powerless is okay if a bit rushed ending for " Heroes " Volume 2	All right , so Claire , in wanting to expose The Company , has broken up with West , who doesn't want his power to go public . Matt and Nathan , having found out everything , are trying to stop Peter and Adam from going to the Primatech Paper building to get the virus . It's there that Hiro vows revenge on his dad's death at Adam's hand but Peter manages to keep him at bay with the electric magnetic powers he got from Elle . So Hiro cheers when Matt and " Flying Man " show up . When Mohinder goes to his apartment and finds Sylar there , Sylar seems a little nice especially when Maya is seen cooking and is glad to finally meet the doctor she's been told is " friends " with Gabriel . Sylar then pulls his gun revealing his intent : he wants the blood from Claire that was meant for Niki to go to him . Maya is surprised by Gabriel's sudden transformation , then gets furious after finding out from Molly the fate of her brother which in turn causes Sylar to shoot her dead ! It turns out to be short lived as Sylar makes Mohinder use it on her first to make sure it actually works . It does so the doc then uses it on him and it looks like he'll be shot by Sylar but then Elle comes in trying to stop him but he gets away . Elle is upset but Mohinder assures her she saved his , Molly , and Maya's lives . Macah goes to his mom to save Monica who's still kidnapped by a gang member . Despite being a little weak because of the virus , Niki manages to knock down this member and go to the warehouse where Monica is as flames threaten to engulf the place . Monica manages to get out but the flames explode before Niki could . Looks like Micah is now an orphan . As Adam and Peter knock down the guards and Peter opens the safe , Nathan , Matt , and Hiro come in with Hiro confronting Adam with Hiro's sword . Adam already has the virus in his hand but when Hiro teleports with Adam , the virus is left behind and is starting to drop when Peter quickly retrieves it . We later find Adam buried alive a deep six feet under in a coffin . Good job , Hiro ! Peter then destroys the virus into dust as Nathan and Matt watch . The Petrelli brothers have a touching reunion as Nathan calls a press conference with Matt using his mind to make sure people show up . As Noah arrives home with a surprised family showing up , he tells them , especially Claire to not expose The Company . He also tells them he's going back there to protect his family and says they'll be in a safe place . Claire still wants to expose The Company . At the press conference , Nathan is about reveal all when he is shot twice in the chest ! After we see Peter hold his dead brother , the next scene is of Mama Petrelli on the phone telling the receiver on the other end how that person has gone too far just the screen goes black and " End of Volume Two " flashes on . Next scene takes place in an alley as " Volume Three , Villains " is printed . Then we see Sylar injecting himself with the new blood after which , we see his hand attempt to raise a spinach can . He succeeds as " To Be Continued " appears afterword on the black screen . . . While this episode seemed to be rushed due the writers strike that was about to be called on , there was plenty of drama and action to make this another entertaining episode of " Heroes " . I did wonder about Caitlin but maybe we'll find out about her after this strike is over . Are Nathan and Niki really dead ? Considering some of Adam's blood was put in him , maybe Nathan will survive . It would be harder to explain how Niki survived that explosion but it's hard to tell who stays dead on a show like " Heroes " . In any case , with a title like " Villians " for the Volume 3 season , I hope the excitement really gets amped up ! So until next time . . .
A Kick for Cinderella was a highly amusing Mutt & Jeff cartoon from the silent era	While this IMDb entry seems to refer to a live-action short released in 1924 , it's also a Mutt & Jeff cartoon released the same year and since there's no listing on this site for that version , I'm reviewing it here . Mutt , the tall one , tells Jeff , the short one , about his invitation to the Charleston Ball . Jeff wants to come to but Mutt makes him stay to " keep the fires " in the fireplace burning . Jeff cries heavily until a fairy godmother grants his wishes . Of course , he has until midnight before everything changes back to normal . . . This was a highly amusing cartoon with several gags that must have really wowed audiences back then like a banana peel that keeps walking to Jeff at the ball to make him slip on it again or the short hand of the clock attempting to knock Jeff off the long hand when he tries to keep the latter from going to 12 ! Mutt , usually his buddy , seems really mean here but if you're familiar with some of these cartoons , the ending shouldn't be much of a surprise . Highly recommended for anyone interested in vintage cartoons . I found this on Cartoon Brew linked from Matinée At The Bijou which put this on YouTube .
This Jerry and Gary Lewis-hosted version of " Hullabaloo " was a fascinating time capsule from the ' 60s	Just found on Guba as linked from the Classic Television Showbiz blog this rare surviving color episode of the ' 60s NBC music series " Hullabaloo " that originally aired on September 20 , 1965 . The guest hosts for this edition were Jerry Lewis with his son Gary who was hot at the time with his band The Playboys . After the network peacock with the announcer saying , " The following is brought to you in living color by NBC " we see a bevy of female dancers in over-sized shirts moving around as Jerry and Gary sing their version of The Beatles ' " Help ! " which while nowhere near as good as the classic single is pretty entertaining in its own cheesy way . Then after Pop promises those models were going to dance with son Gary's group , we see The Playboys singing " Everybody Loves a Clown " with six-year-old girls standing or sitting in a playground setting . After the song ends , the blonde one that stood by Gary the whole time asks for his autograph . When he asks if she wants one from his dad as well , she shrugs and says , " Who ? " Then Joanie Sommers sings a song about losing someone that was touching . After that , we see Jerry introduce a song written by a 19-year-old ( P . F . Sloan ) that addresses the social issues of the day ( and could do the same for today with just a few lyric changes ) . It's Barry McGuire's No . 1 hit , " Eve of Destruction " . Then we once again see the dancers with many of the guests and hosts singing many of the other Top Ten hits of the day only one of which-McGuire's version of " Hang On Sloopy " - I recognize . At the end of this segment , Gary introduces " My father , the singer " , similar to when Jerry said " My son , the singer " earlier , as we hear something Pop Lewis apparently was planning to release . The song and his performance were pretty good although I did detect some mugging . Last we hear Paul Revere and the Raiders in a nightclub setting with the dancers performing a song I did not recognize . After that as the credits roll , Gary and dad Jerry say goodnight as they plug the following weeks lineup with Jerry now wearing one of the Raiders ' Revolutionary War outfits and the dancers continue on dancing . . . This was a fascinating time capsule chronicle of a time before Gary went to Vietnam and suffered post-traumatic stress and Jerry was just getting hooked on pills . And kudos to the uploader who presented the show on Guba in the original video tape version as opposed to the black-and-white kinescops that exist of other surviving " Hullabaloo " shows . Well worth a look for anyone interested in this sort of thing .
Definitely , Maybe is a compelling romantic comedy for adults	Just watched this romantic comedy-about a divorced father ( Ryan Reynolds ) telling his daughter ( Abigail Breslin ) about her potential mother from three past lovers ( Rachel Wiesz , Isla Fisher , Elizabeth Banks ) - with my parents . We were all amused by some lines especially some concerning Bill Clinton since Reynolds plays someone who was involved in the former president's inaugural ' 92 campaign who later got disillusioned by his later scandal concerning Monica Lewinsky . There's even a sight of a Clinton lookalike jogging with his men in a later scene . Besides the players I just mentioned , there's also Kevin Kline who plays an grizzly author who is also involved in Wiesz's character . They all enact their characters in a compellingly believable fashion and while some may be alarmed with Ms . Breslin ( who's 11 here ) saying words like " penis " and " vagina " especially having come from a sex education class , it at least gets the Reynolds character to be a little honest about his relationships from before she was born though he stops when she asks what " threesome " means ! And Ms . Fisher is the best of the three women in the flashback scenes as her character exposes her venerability as compared to her previous role in Wedding Crashers . So for anyone looking for a more adult romcom , I highly recommend Definitely , Maybe .
Injun Trouble is an early Porky Pig cartoon by Bob Clampett	Plenty of funny gags typical of Bob Clampett and the whole Termite Terrace gang abound in this Porky Pig Looney Tune that has the stuttering porcine character encountering Injun Joe and the hillbilly known as Sloppy Moe . Wanna to see a bear cut down to size and crying ? It's here ! Wanna to see that same bear get a treat from Joe in the form of a big dessert which Joe eats most of ? Also here . Also Sloppy Moe knows " something I won't tell " which he sings to the tune of " London Bridge Is Falling Down " and which he doesn't reveal until the end . He sounds like Pinto Colvig's Goofy but IMDb lists Mel Blanc as doing the voice . Anyway , this may be a little politically incorrect by today's standards but it's still pretty amusing to me . I checked this out on YouTube .
The Green Pastures is , despite some stereotypes , wonderfully inspirational	In reviewing African-Americans on film in chronological order for Black History Month , we're now at 1936 with the first all-black production for a major studio since Hallelujah ! from MGM in 1929 : The Green Pastures from Warner Bros . Rex Ingram stars in three roles-De Lawd , Adam , and Hezdrel . As De Lawd , Ingram brings a human dimension to the Supreme Being that expresses his doubts occasionally because of the way things turn out . Playwright Marc Connelly brought to his screenplay adaptation some wonderful humorous touches in retelling some of the bible stories like that exchange between De Lawd and Noah ( Eddie Anderson who I just saw at the beginning of Show Boat ) about whether to bring one keg or two of whiskey to the ark or Gabriel ( Oscar Polk ) saying he'll spit in the eye of Satan ! Among the females , Edna Mae Harris makes an impression in her brief role of Zeba who , after her boyfriend gets shot , takes a shine to the one who shot him ! Was most impressed with the Moses story especially the trick scene with the walking stick turning into a snake and what happened afterward when the Pharaoh initially refused Moses ' request to let his people go . The spiritual singing of the Hall Johnson Choir serving as score throughout was very inspirational . And having New Orleans being mentioned as the Sin City told this Louisianian how some things never change ! While , yes , there's some stereotypes about the Negroes being such simple people ( with heaven presented as a fish fry and the angels getting ten-cent cigars ) , there's also a message about tolerance and how , despite all that's wrong with the world , there's also plenty that's right that is made clear at the end when there's word of someone being nailed at the cross . . .
Night Nurse is one of Barbara Stanwyck's early underrated movies	Just finished watching this pre-Code movie called Night Nurse starring Barbara Stanwyck on VHS as one in several of a series of videocassettes named " Forbidden Hollywood " hosted by Leonard Maltin . Before the picture starts Maltin tells of and shows many scenes that a few years after the year this film was made ( 1931 ) wouldn't have been allowed . Like scenes of Ms . Stanwyck and Joan Blondell undressing or of a bootlegger ( Ben Lyon ) getting away with murder . Clark Gable , in one of his early roles , impresses greatly in his scenes with Barbara as the brutal chauffeur who's in cahoots with the crooked doctor in her hospital . And it's always a treat to see Charles Winninger in another one of his kindly elderly paternal roles , here as Stanwyck's moral superior . And seeing Blondell and Lyon with the leading lady are such a treat that I'm now curious if they did anything else together . Quickly and efficiently helmed by William Wellman who directed James Cagney to stardom in The Public Enemy the same year , Night Nurse is one of his more underrated gems .
The Girlfriend was a wonderful comeback episode ( after a writer's strike ) for " Samantha Who ? "	During a chance meeting , Samantha and Todd bump into each other and ask how each are doing . Later that day , as she and her mother discuss a makeover with the father out on a trip , Samantha gets a call for dinner from Todd . That dinner was just Todd's way of telling her that Chloe is moving in with him in Sam's apartment that she still owns and Todd still lives in . Though Andrea suggests the ways of the old Sam like making a girlfriend of a man she wants think he's a two-timer by presenting a wine bottle as his gift to them , Sam wants to be fair to Chloe since she's done nothing wrong . At that point , the female president of the co-op board walks by and tells Sam that subletting is illegal at her building . So Sam moves in with Todd and Chloe . Things seem to go well , if a little awkward , but then when Sam wakes in the middle of the night , Chloe threatens her to leave her man alone . In the morning , Chloe's too sunny disposition confuses Sam and when Todd has Sam alone he tells her that Chloe told him that Sam threatened her ! Just then , Chloe comes out with her toy koala with an eye marked with a felt tip pen which she blames on Sam . Sam , denying responsibility , leaves . During much of this , Dena walks into Sam's mom's home and sees the mother having a drink because of her daughter's ditching her . So she agrees to the makeover since " your mom's dead and my daughter's gallivanting around " . The mom confesses to being runner-up in a beauty pageant years ago while Dena mentions drawing a turtle to get accepted in an art school that didn't take her . They resolve to TP that pageant winner's house . They eventually wake up with a rabbit statue that they took from that house . Meanwhile , Sam tries to be like her old self when Chloe arrives to find clothes strewn on the floor and Sam coming out of the shower with a nightie on . That backfires when Todd comes back in . Despite Chloe confessing to vandalizing her own bear , Todd picks her over Sam . After talking to Frank , who agrees to let the co-op president think Sam still lives there , Sam returns to her mother's home as the mom washes the giant turtle face off the wall . . . This was another heartwarming funny episode of " Samantha Who ? " that makes a wonderful comeback after the three-months-old writer's strike . My favorite part was Frank's reason for taking it easy on Sam : He thinks Chole is the same as Sam ( before her amnesia ) and doesn't want to deal with them both at the same time ! Christina Applegate sure has come a long way from Kelly Bundy on " Married . . . with Children " . So with that , until next time . . .
The Hockey Date is another highly amusing episode of " Samanatha Who ? "	Because Samantha seems to spend most of her time with Dena playing Life at her parents ' house , her mom thinks she should try dating again . Sam explains that since she has amnesia , she just can't talk about herself in front of a stranger when she doesn't know who she is . Her mom says to not let something like that stop her ! She goes to ex-lover-now-friend Todd for info about her former life . He's now " running " with a woman named Chloe ( Kiele Sanchez ) who thinks Sam's condition means she's deaf as she keeps talking loud . Todd mentions Sam's passion for hockey . The next day , as her parents leave her alone with a man they invited called Kevin ( Eddie Cibrian ) , she reveals her liking hockey which gets her a date with him . Before that , however , Sam goes with Todd to the stadium so she can watch a game she's forgot about . What she also forgot was that her old self got arrested at said stadium for faking a handicap in order to get free tickets . She's now banned from going there again . Meanwhile , Andrea , who was supposed to be in Rome with her new boyfriend , reluctantly turns to Dena ( who she calls " Tina " ) after said boyfriend dumps her . After getting thrown out , Sam and Todd play darts at a bar as they bond over some good times . As Kevin arrives , Todd leaves , then Sam tells Kevin the truth about herself . Kevin still wants her . Sam feels good as she later joins Andrea and Dena , both of whom are passing themselves off as " Canadian Flight Attendents " to potential suitors . . . Another funny episode of " Samantha Who ? " that keeps getting better as the weeks go by . Nice to see Dena and Andrea bond a little bit here . Also nice to see Ms . Sanchez , post - " Lost " , and Mr . Cibrian , post - " Invasion " . They're amusing as , I'm sure , temporary mates for Todd and Sam , respectively . As always , Christina Applegate is very amusing playing both her crafty old self and her more sweet new self . Hope the ratings did well enough opposite its new competitor , " Two and a Half Men " .
Purlie Victorious is amusing depiction of early ' 60s south	If you've ever wondered whether anything satirical was ever made about the civil rights struggles of the 1960s , Ossie Davis ' Purlie Victorious may be the answer you're looking for . Davis , who is the movie's and original play's author , plays the title role as a preacher who , with help from fiancée Lutiebelle Jenkins ( wife Ruby Dee ) , tries to claim his $500 inheritance from former employer Stonewall Jackson Cotchipee ( Sorrell Booke in his Dukes of Hazzard southern accent ) . Jenkins manages to convince Cotchipee she's the cousin of Purlie . . . until she signs her own name on the receipt ! While that's all I'll reveal of the plot , I'd also like to mention the other players : Beah Richards , newcomer Alan Alda , and a hilarious turn by Godfrey Cambridge . While some of the performances may be over-the-top , that shouldn't stop you from enjoying the nuances of characterization that inform the narrative to its eventual conclusion . By all means , seek this one out .
George Stevens ' Mama Loves Papa is hilarious !	Mama Loves Papa is an entry in Hal Roach's The Boy Friends series . Among the stars are occasional W . C . Fields stooge Grady Sutton and a couple of former original Our Gangers Mickey Daniels and Mary Kornman , here playing brother and sister . The plot concerns Daniels and Kornman's mother about to marry another brother and sister's father . To keep this from happening , both pair siblings try to convince the others ' parents that they're crazy . What follows are various gags that , typical for ' 30 comedies especially for Hal Roach , involve making yourself look tiny , pretending to chop sibling's head , and hanging from a chandelier ! After all this is cleared up , one of the adult children finds a pastor to marry the new stepparents but this results in a twist you may guess if you're familiar with many of these sitcom-like plots over the years but I won't reveal here ! Funny short from beginning to end and well directed by former Laurel and Hardy cameraman George Stevens . By all means , seek this out !
The Flamboyant Arms is a highly amusing Deitch / Terrytoon short	This is a latter-day Terrytoons short from the Gene Deitch era . It stars Clint Clobber , a janitor for an apartment . In this one , he has to hurry up and make sure the building is spic and span for inspection by the building's owner . Of course , everything goes disastrously wrong from sewer trash rising to lights blinking to water pipes blowing to Clobber electrocuting himself ! Well timed pacing by director Connie Rasinski makes this one of the funnier cartoons from the late ' 50s . Well worth seeing on YouTube for anyone who's a fan of Deitch or Terrytoons . Maybe someday , a collection of many of these forgotten animated shorts will be made available for viewing on DVD .
Death of a Gunfighter was Lena Horne's only straight drama	In continuing to review African-Americans on film and television in chronological order for Black History Month , we're now at 1969 with Death of a Gunfighter with Lean Horne in her only straight role though you do hear her recording of the song , " Sweet Apple Wine " in the beginning and end credits . Though she's billed above the title with Richard Widmark , her role of Claire Quintana is very much a supporting one that's mainly there as one of the few people who stands by Marshal Frank Patch ( Widmark ) as the townspeople are fed up with his violent ways of dealing with justice . Also among the supporting cast are Michael McGreevey as Dan-a young man who also likes the marshal , Darleen Carr-sister of The Sound of Music's Charmian Carr-as his girlfriend Hilda , Jacqueline Scott-probably best known as Richard Kimble's sister Donna on " The Fugitive-as the widow , Laurie Mills , of the first man killed by Patch at the beginning of the movie , Harry Carey , Jr . as Rev . Rork , John Saxon as county Shriff Lou Trinidad who tries to get Patch to get out of town peacefully , and , in a nice surprise from his later role as Archie Bunker , Carroll O'Connor as the bar owner , Lester Locke , who bides his time in letting other people get Frank before he himself tries . Many of the cast I just mentioned and lots of others I haven't contribute great tension as the film chronicles the last days of the Marshal . Horne acquits herself nicely with her few scenes and it's nice seeing her and Widmark kiss at their wedding especially when one knows that Widmark played a racist opposite Sidney Poitier in his movie debut , No Way Out ( 1950 ) . Love the music score , by Oliver Nelson , and direction especially many of the close-ups . That direction , by the way , was credited to one " Allen Smithee " which is the name used when the real director doesn't want his own name used . In this case , they're Robert Totten-who had " creative differences " with Widmark , and Don Siegel-who had filmed the actor previously in Madigan . This marked " Smithee's " feature film debut . All in all , Death of a Gunfighter was another pleasant surprise for me .
What on Earth ! was a nice satirical animated short from The National Film Board of Canada	Just watched this Oscar-nominated animated short on YouTube . Presented by " The National Film Board of Mars " , What on Earth ! has a narrator telling the Mars audience about the life there is on Earth that feeds on a pump of gas . It seems he's referring to the cars that dominate the highway . We also find out about the " Earthling " s " retirement " parking place and how they " reproduce " . And then there are those " parasites " ( humans ) that inhabit these " Earthlings " . . . This satirical animated short from The National Film Board of Canada hits the mark of how the Mars people think the cars are the living creatures since the road is dominated by them . And considering how there hasn't been any evidence of actual life on the red planet yet , there's no chance of anyone there being offended by the material here . So on that note , I cautiously recommend What on Earth !
Richard Donner's cut of Superman II was mostly an improvement on the previous Richard Lester one	While I remember enjoying Superman II when I was a young teen in 1981 and the way Richard Lester directed most of it , I was a little ecstatic to finally see this Richard Donner cut or what most of his version might have been . Certainly the way Margot Kidder was figuring out Clark Kent's true identity in this version was way more believable here with the way she kept edging on Christopher Reeve's character constantly after drawing a suit on Supes ' picture in the Daily Planet than the one in Lester's cut when she suddenly had an epiphany after just seeing him without his glasses . And seeing Marlon Brando here as Jor-El was better use than seeing Susannah York as Lara in the previous one . I think I would've preferred seeing Lois continue to deal with her knowing Superman's secret identity than use that " turn back time spinning the world " crap again . That certainly makes Clark's revenge against that bully less satisfying . I also remember the ABC network version that had some deleted scenes that were included in that version such as Gene Hackman's Lex getting arrested at the Fortress of Solutude instead of just being left there by Lois and Superman or Clark the next day at the Daily Planet bumping into a man who tells him to " try sleeping a little bit more , buster ! " that are in the Deleted Scenes section of this disc and one more scene of a boy riding a horse getting killed by Ursa as she throws something at him as she says , " He'll never be a man ! " that isn't . The first two slows the movie somewhat but the last one defines how evil the villains really are . Oh , and as a " Cheers " and James Bond fan , I was pleasantly surprised to see John Ratzenberger as a NASA operator and Clifton James as a sheriff ( probably the same one from Live and Let Die and The Man with the Golden Gun ! ) . So for the most part , I loved Superman II : The Richard Donner Cut . P . S . One more interesting note between the Donner and Lester versions : In the previous one , Lois sleeps with Superman after he becomes normal while in this one Superman does it with her before that .
A Christmas Dream or Vanocni sen is a wonderful holiday short from Czechoslovakia	Just watched on YouTube as linked from Matinée at the Bijou this vintage live action / puppet animation short from the Czech Republic called A Christmas Dream here in the U . S . A little girl throws away her old rag doll after getting some new presents . Santa appears to get the girl dreaming about her old doll dancing , playing the piano , sliding on it , and getting a large fan to create a strong gust wind that threatens to create havoc but the girl and the doll manages to put a stop to that . Seeing the doll and a few other toys come to life is the charm of this short especially when the live action girl reacts most enthusiastically . The directors were the brother ( I think ) team of Karel and Borivoj Zeman . They seemed to be channeling George Pal when making this . So with all that in mind , I highly recommend A Christmas Dream or as it's known in its native language , Vanocni sen .
George Clooney's Good Night , and Good Luck . makes a fine dramatized documentary	In making Good Night , and Good Luck . , director George Clooney has made a nearly perfect dramatization of the issues legendary CBS newsman Edward R . Murrow ( perfectly played by David Straithain ) had with the " junior senator from Wisconsin " , Joseph R . McCarthy and the way he tried to " infiltrate " Communists in the United States . There's also some suspense when one of Murrow's assistants receives some info from an associate of McCarthy that accuses Murrow of having some " Red " connections himself . That assistant , played by Robert Downey , Jr . , tells the associate that no one would believe him since publicly , Murrow has proved to the public what a patriot he was since his radio reports from Britain since World War II ! Clooney acquits himself nicely taking the supporting part of Murrow's producer Fred Friendly . One Friendly scene that really impressed me was an argument with a Colonel ( played by " 24 " s Glen Morshower ) whose military base had basically fired a soldier named Milo Radulovich because of his father's Communist sympathies branding the son as a " risk " . The Colonel did not want that story to air . While many of Straithain's lines as Murrow came verbatim from many of " See It Now " s transcripts , there are some liberties taken with when some events took place ( like when the Army-McCarthy hearings were on live , Ed was not doing his other show , " Person to Person " since that show aired on primetime and the hearings were on the afternoons ) . Also , seeing Diane Reeves performing her jazz stylings in rehearsal at an adjacent CBS soundstage throughout the movie was obviously meant to ironically comment on many events depicted here such as " How High the Moon " coming before Murrow eulogizes on a fellow newsman's death ( that of Don Hollenbeck who's played by Ray Wise ) . The screenplay by Clooney and Grant Heslov ( who plays a young Don Hewit here ) , contained enough info to explain why Murrow felt the way he did about the senator and why his boss , CBS chairman Bill Paley ( Frank Langella ) who Ed is on a first-name basis with , would initially support him before complaining of an " upset stomach " concerning the newsman's point-of-view . Other good performances come from Jeff Daniels as a liaison between Murrow and " See It Now " s sponsor , Alcoa ( by the way , check out the irony between the " glamorous " smoking of many of the characters and the way " Person to Person " s sponsor , Kent Cigarattes , tells you how good smoking is in addressing viewers skepticism of many TV messages ! ) and , as a Louisiana resident who loves to point out performers from the Pelican state , New Orleans native Patricia Clarkson as another Murrow employee who's secretly married to Downey . If there's some quibble with this movie , it's with the long footage devoted to accused " Communist spy " Annie Lee Moss which almost stops the movie though Murrow's explanation at the end does make some points . So to anyone interested in this fascinating piece of television news history , I highly recommend Good Night , and Good Luck .
Chuck Jones ' Don't Give Up the Sheep is hilarious !	A sheepdog named Ralph says hello to another one named Fred as they both punch time clocks with Ralph clocking in . He's keeping watch over the sheep that a wolf ( who looks like While E . Coyote ) keeps trying to capture but always is caught by Ralph who keeps punching him . The wolf tries many ways to fool him like playing with the time clock so that Ralph has lunch early . There's also a sawing gag between the two that ends with the laws of gravity being violated ( but then , I never studied law ! ) . At the end , as Ralph is beating the wolf , Fred clocks back in and takes over as Ralph leaves ! Once again , Chuck Jones mines hilarity from the mundane and comes up aces every time ! Don't Give Up the Sheep is highly recommended .
Daffy Duck Hunt brings the duck and Porky back to their original adversarial relationship	In the late ' 40s and early ' 50s while Chuck Jones was making Porky and Daffy cartoons that had the latter the " hero " while the former the " sidekick " , Robert McKimson was bringing back the adversarial relationship they originally had when they first met in Tex Avery's Porky's Duck Hunt . This short is similar to that in that Porky is once again a hunter who's looking for ducks . Daffy , of course , becomes the target but because he emptied many bullet shells of pellets , the shooting Porky does won't hurt him . At this point , the dog makes a deal with the duck for him to surrender to him so his master won't throw him out . Many funny gags involving the duck and dog follow . And dig the holiday twist that ends this short . So on that note , I highly recommend Daffy Duck Hunt .
Cooter marks a hilarious second season ender for " 30 Rock "	With this being the season finale written by creator / star Tina Fey , here's the synopsis in a nutshell : Jack , having taken a position with Homeland Security because of Guiess ' coma and the aftermath in the last episode , calls Liz from D . C . and tells her he won't be back . Liz finds she's tested positive for pregnancy and has revealed to Jenna that Dennis is the father . Kenneth tells Pete about applying to be a page at the Beijing Olympics which Pete can relate to since he still resents then-President Carter for boycotting the Moscow one when he was practicing archery . " Peanut farmer ! " Turns out the deadline is due today and not two weeks from now so Kenneth's nemesis page purposely gave him the wrong memo . Thankfully , Jenna helps with her DVD on the page's qualities . Back in D . C . , Jack is mentoring a Cooter Burger ( Matthew Broderick ) the acting head of Homeland Security who keeps denying ceiling leaks and whose office has no pens . After his former receptionist Jonathan calls about Guiess saying something from his coma , Jack tries to quit but has to get himself fired so he asks for former love C . C . ' s help . An item about a " Gay Bomb " might do the trick . . . Lots of other stuff happens here but let me just say this was a pretty hilarious way to end the strike-shortened second season of " 30 Rock " ! Loved seeing the return of Dennis and C . C . Plenty of fine visuals to accommodate the many witty lines thought up by Ms . Fey . The " Three Months Later " cliffhangers should be enough for anyone to savor the next season when " 30 Rock " comes back for , once again , a full season . ( unless a possible actors strike goes into effect after June 30 . . . ) Now about that " Gay Bomb " . . .
Bitter Sweets is another enjoyable episode of " Pushing Daises "	All right , here is this episode in a nutshell : The murder of a man named Tony is blamed on his girlfriend Tina , Tina gets out of jail when Tony's friend Alfredo is fingered by Tony after Ned revives him for a minute , Alfredo blames it on his girlfriend who is an inflatable doll but takes the rap for her anyway , Billy and Dilly Balsam ( Mike White and Molly Shannon , director and star of Year of the Dog from earlier this year ) have opened a candy shop called Bitter Sweets across from The Pie Hole ( which now reads " The Pie Ho " after the lights of the last two letters fritz out ) meaning rivalry between the shops though Ned doesn't believe in competition , Billy later turns up dead in a candy vat that Ned discovers as Dilly catches him thinking he's the culprit and has him arrested , Chuck and Emerson resolve to solve the crime without Ned's help , Ned ends up in jail with Alfredo who's happy knowing his " girlfriend " is waiting for him , and after the case is closed and Ned's free , he finally confesses to Chuck that he killed her father which stuns her as the episode ends . . . I've skipped through some plot points but if you've already seen " Bitter Sweets " you know what happened between the lines . Another enjoyable episode of " Pushing Daises " and it's nice to see Olive think of someone other than Ned , specifically that salesman who likes her who's now gone to other places . Here's hoping he returns soon . Next week's preview shows that Chuck leaves after knowing Ned's truth about her father . Hope she doesn't go too far away . Knowing that the next episode that comes two weeks from now was the last before the writer's strike , I hope that gets resolved ( to the writers ' favor ) in time for some new ones at least next spring . " Pushing Daises " is just too good a show to just disappear . Fingers crossed ! P . S . Loved seeing Molly Shannon again .
The Jerusalem Duality explores Sheldon's weak side in " The Big Bang Theory "	Dr . Eric Gablehauser ( Mark Harelik ) brings 15-year-old Dennis Kim ( Austin Lee ) to Sheldon and Leonard's attention . He wants Sheldon to welcome him in as a fellow associate . Unfortunately , Sheldon is jealous of him because he accomplished so much at a younger age than when Sheldon was during his teen years ( except for when Dennis ' family was digging themselves out of Korea ) . Depressed , Sheldon then busts in on assignments of his friends ' which results in the same admonition from Leonard , Howard , and Raj : " Go away ! " So those three resolve to get a girl to socialize with Dennis by bringing a bunch of many of them his age to the welcoming party . For a while , he seems uninterested but after Gablehauser introduces him , Dennis comes in and says " no thanks , I'm taking Emma to the mall " as a tall blonde accompanies him . Sheldon than steps in confidently and says , " While Mr . Kim , by virtue of his youth and naiveté , has fallen prey to the inexplicable need for human contact , let me step in and assure you that my research will go on uninterrupted , and that social relationships will continue to baffle and repulse me ! " We then see Dennis enjoying kissing Emma under the tree while Leonard , Howard , and Raj look on wondering how he got so lucky when they weren't as fortunate at his age while Sheldon couldn't care less . . . Another hilarious episode of " The Big Bang Theory " that explores Sheldon's venerability concerning himself no longer being the unique prodigy he once was . We also find out here , with Penny's questioning of why the other three hang with Sheldon who can be so arrogant at times , Howard simply says , " We liked Leonard . " Also hilarious was hearing painful dating stories of Leonard and Howard when they were teens . So glad CBS renewed " The Big Bang Theory " for another season . You rock , Chuck Lorre ! By the way , Emma Degerstedt had previously appeared on " Samantha Who ? " as a teen Sam .
Apollo , Apollo was another very funny episode of " 30 Rock "	In this episode , Liz is visited by former " sex partner " Dennis who's trying to make amends for his behavior . She then finds out on Jenna's phone that Dennis had sex with her as well . Having accomplished almost everything on his list since his 10th birthday , Jack wants the excitement of that childhood back in a bad way . And Tracy wants to fulfill his own dream of going into space . . . How welcome to see Dean Winters back as Dennis ( not to mention as Charlie on the next to last episode of " Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles " this season ) ! This particular episode of " 30 Rock " was very funny from beginning to end especially the way Kenneth sees everybody he encounters as Muppets ! And hearing Liz impersonate Jenna as British on Jenna's phone to Dennis and then Jenna explaining that she lost her virginity to the My Fair Lady soundtrack was a clever touch . And then there's this commercial Liz did for a phone sex line in Chicago . And how about that Adam West cameo . . .
Disover the charms of Powell and Loy in After the Thin Man	After the Thin Man is the first movie I've seen in the William Powell-Myrna Loy series and what a treat it is to finally discover the charms of Nick and Nora Charles as well as their dog Asta ! Returning to their San Francisco home on New Year's Eve , they find a surprise party at which only the servants recognize them ! Nora later gets a call from her female cousin about her missing husband . That's all I'm going to reveal about the plot so I'll just mention that James Stewart makes one of his most interesting early appearances on film . Also , a dark-haired pre-Blondie Penny Singleton ( then billed under her real name Dorothy McNulty ) contributes a hilarious line about illiteracy that I won't reveal here . Also , wasn't that Arthur Housman as the drunk at the surprise party ? He certainly looked like the same guy I saw in some Laurel and Hardy shorts ! If you like murder mystery screwball comedies , this movie is highly recommended that you seek out !
Finnegan's Flea is Famous / Paramount's partial version of One Froggy Evening	Just watched this Paramount Modern Madcap cartoon on YouTube . The story here is similar to Chuck Jones ' One Froggy Evening except the creature singing is a flea , there's dialogue as opposed to pantomime , and the people Finnegan goes to actually sees the fly warbling . So Finnegan should be getting in the riches but 13 years later , he's in a standing coma at a bar where the bartender tells why to a fellow customer . . . I'll stop there and just say that nothing funny happens until the cause of Finnegan's coma are shown . This is , however , a well told story with interesting limited animation shown throughout . The bartender telling the tale is Jackson " Bluto " Beck . And among the songs sung by the flea is the Fleischer / Famous standard " It's a Hap-Hap-Happy Day " which was co-written by the music director of this short-Winston Sharples . So with all that said , Finnegan's Flea comes highly recommend .
Marvel at the art of Bill Irwin : Clown Prince	Bill Irwin : Clown Prince is a fascinating documentary of Irwin's experiences from graduating from Ringling Bros . Clown School to his first public performance in the Pickle Family Circus to his performance of The Swinger ( a mime dance to Peaches and Herb's " Shake Your Grove Thing " ) to The Regard of Flight ( there's a funny segment involving the word " Okay " ) . There's also a hilarious segment of the short film As Seen on TV ( from the TV show Alive from Off Center ) that would later get staged as Largely in New York and there are segments of Waiting for Godot in which Irwin just babbles while Steve Martin and Robin Williams try to stop him ( By the way , Martin and Williams do a funny switching hat routine that reminds me of Laurel and Hardy ) . Irwin is proof that silent comedy of the Chaplin / Lloyd / Keaton style is alive and well on the New York stage . Here's hoping someone is watching that may top Irwin some day !
The Josephine Baker Story provides nearly excellent depictions of her life and career	In continuing to review African-Americans in film in chronological order for Black History Month , we're now at 1991 with HBO's biographical movie , The Josephine Baker Story . Before going on with my comment , I'd like to mention that star Lynn Whitfield is a native of the city I now live in , Baton Rouge , La . As the title indicates , this TV film chronicles the life and career of Ms . Baker , who rose from poverty in St . Louis to become the toast of France . In between , she tries and fails to integrate the U . S . ( at least outside of her shows ) and adopts lots of multicultural children to the consternation of her second husband . That husband-band leader Jo Boullion-was played by the late David Dukes who I remember first seeing as the man who attempted rape on Edith Bunker on " All in the Family " . Other familiar faces that appeared here were Kene Holliday-who I remember as Baker on " Carter Country " - as musician Sidney Bechet , Louis Gossett Jr . as army leader Sidney Williams , Ruben Blades as Count Giuseppe Pepito Abatino-Baker's first husband , and Craig T . Nelson-who I first saw in Poltergeist-as columnist Walter Winchell who contributes to Baker's decline in the U . S . I'd also like to note Vivian Bonnell as Jo's mother , Mayah McCoy as Baker at 8 , and Ainslie Currie as Baker at 13 . All these performances and especially Ms . Whitfield's are excellent throughout . The director was the late Brian Gibson who briefly married Lynn and later guided Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishburne to Oscar nominations as Tina and Ike Turner in What's Love Got to Do with It . Like that movie , this one ends with real-life documentary footage . It's of Ms . Baker's funeral with her adopted kids attending . While I'm sure some liberties were taken in the depiction of Josephine Baker's life , the story flows so smoothly that one doesn't notice where those spots might be unless some viewers had read some of the books about her . So on that note , I highly recommend The Josephine Baker Story .
Gary Cooper is excellent as Lou Gehrig in The Pride of the Yankees	To celebrate the 4th of July , I decided to watch this excellent movie about a great American hero , The Pride of the Yankees , which is an account of the life of the late , great baseball player , Lou Gehrig . Gary Cooper has just the right mix of shyness , joy , humor , and love of the game to portray what was considered the real Lou's personality . Teresa Wright has the moxie to match the chemistry with Cooper as Gehrig's eventual wife , Eleanor . What a treat to see Walter Brennan , who previously appeared with Gary in Sergeant York and Meet John Doe , again support him as sportswriter and friend Sam Blake . His scenes with Dan Duryea are some of the most humorous here . Loved seeing Lou promise a bedridden kid to hit two home runs and then seeing that kid years later come back for Gehrig's farewell address . I was also very amused to see Charles Williams , Cousin Eustace in It's a Wonderful Life , here playing a bell ringer in a carnival . Babe Ruth is not so bad playing himself ! Leigh Harline , composer of Pinochio , has a fine score here . Irving Berlin's song , " Always " , is nicely performed by a female singer on stage and is used appropriately in parts of the score . And certainly one of the greatest words ever spoken comes from here : " I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth . " So , show your pride and watch a biography of one of America's greatest heroes , Lou Gehrig , this Independence Day !
Beneath the Southern Cross is another essential Victory at Sea episode	It's the battle of the South Atlantic between the British ship Devonshire and the German ship Atlantis . Plenty of footage of South America , both as sympathizers to the Nazi cause and , much later , as American allies willing to aid their northern neighbor's cause . . . More compelling footage of sea battles accompanied , as always , by the stirring music of Richard Rodgers and likewise that of Leonard Graves ' narration . Highly essential viewing for anyone interested in the way World War II was filmed for the record of depicting the what , how , and why of the decisions of the various world leaders and the way it affected the rest of the fighting men doing the actual battles .
Return of the Allies showcases the U . S . taking back their Philippine commonwealth from Japan on Victory at Sea	Just before the U . S . entered World War II , the Japanese managed to conquer their Commonwealth of the Philippines . After Pearl Harbor , some plans began formulating on freeing the Asian island from the Land of the Rising Sun but a full scale invasion didn't come to fruition until 1944 . By January of the following year , much of the Philippines was liberated as its people cheered the Americans and looked forward to complete independence two years later . . . A touching tribute to the will of the Philippine people to survive among insurmountable odds the barbaric regime of Japan as they waited for the U . S . liberation . On a personal note , my dad was there as a toddler while my mom was born there during some of those battles . Maybe someday I'll ask them about this period . Anyway , kudos as always for the stirring narration and music from , respectively , Leonard Graves and Richard Rodgers . Most highly recommended for World War II history buffs as well as those interested in their Philippine heritage .
Winsor McCay's How a Mosquito Operates shows how something made 95 years ago can still be effective now	As a person who doesn't normally watch horror films but has taken in some once in awhile and , while somewhat scared , was also entertained enough to not be too grossed out , I found Winsor McCay's How a Mosquito Operates a little mind-frightening enough to think if I was still an under-12 kid watching this for the first time , I'd walk out of the room ! Seeing the bottom of this creature grow every time he sucks some blood out of this human man who's just trying to sleep seriously gives me the creeps ! And that ending when he explodes after draining too much blood ! Aaargh ! Other than that , this was one of the most compelling and unique animation films made in the early 20th century and it shows that not everything made way before I was born can seem so old-fashioned . So to anyone who's wondered if things made way before your time can seem so quaint and old hat , watch this and see if this doesn't blow your mind !
Two If By Sea is another serious segment of Victory at Sea	The United States prepare to attack the Japanese as they attempt to conquer Peleliu and Anguar near the Philippines . Various casualties on both sides as we witness many deaths and captures at the end . . . This episode begins with a quote from the bible that starts with " To everything turn , turn , turn . . . " that would later become the Pete Seegar-The Byrds song , " Turn , Turn , Turn " . Appropriate beginning with various other inspirational messages throughout . Was very surprised to see some mens ' naked backsides here ! One of the most somber episodes of Victory at Sea aided by , as always , the stirring narration and music by Leonard Graves and Richard Rodgers , respectively . Another segment highly recommended for World War II history buffs .
Cab Calloway's Jitterbug Party was another entertaining musical short	After performing two numbers in the Cotton Club-the first one with nothing but gibberish , Cab takes some friends to the title party where he sings one more number , " The Call of the Jitterbug " before it's called a reel . . . The announcer is the only white guy I saw here so this is obviously a major studio production ( Paramount ) . Since there's no contrived plot and just Cab calling to his friends at a table is the only dialogue here , this was another entertaining musical short that appeared on the DVD from Kino Video called " Hollywood Rhythm Vol . 1 : The Best of Jazz and Blues " . It's nice to know so many of the Hi-De-Ho man's early music performances have been preserved for posterity .
The Great Toy Robbery is a fine Canadian animated holiday short	Just discovered this quite funny animated short from Warren Leonhardt on his blog as linked from The National Film Board of Canada site . It takes place in the Old West with a cowboy , some robbers , and Santa Claus . Oh , and some toys . It takes a while but the way the gags are timed , you just can't help double up with laughter at how sudden some movements are and the way the whole thing is executed . Kudos go to director / co-animator Jeffrey Hale , Derek Lamb who did the storyboard and design , Don Douglas for the cool music , and Richard Gilbert for the voices . Oh , and I loved the way that horse doesn't always listen to the cowboy's commands ! So on that note , I highly recommend The Great Toy Robbery .
A Raisin in the Sun marks my farewell comment for Black History Month	This entry of the 2008 TV movie version of Lorraine Hansberry's play " A Raisin in the Sun " that just aired on ABC four days ago , is my final entry on African-Americans in film and television in chronological order for Black History Month . Nearly the entire cast of the recent Broadway revival of this still-resonant drama-Phylicia Rashad , Sean Combs , Audra McDonald , Sanaa Lathan , and Bill Nunn-reprise their roles here . They're all great as well as Sean Patric Thomas , David Oyelowo , Paul Stephen , and , as Carl Linder-the man who tries to buy the Youngers out of their new house , John Stamos . Rashad and McDonald , both of whom won Tonys for their performances , should repeat at the Emmys this fall . Combs , usually known as Puff Daddy / P . Diddy / Diddy , holds his own with the experienced veterans here . Scenes such as Rashad slapping daughter Lathan after the latter denounces God or Combs doing his " shufflin ' Negro " act near the end to everyone's disgust still packs a wallop . And writer Paris Qualles , whose work I just watched on The Rosa Parks Story , and director Kenny Leon open up the play's locations and expand on the dialogue considerably well . What else can I say except it's been a wonderful journey watching how much African-American performers and filmmakers have evolved over the nearly 90 years with nearly 100 listings here at IMDb during this special month . With the writer's strike still in effect at the beginning of it , I thought this was as good a time as any to celebrate some of the most acclaimed and popular celebrities America and the world has ever known . With that , I'll just say thanks for anyone who's read this and my other BHM comments and gave me favorable and even not-so-favorable marks as a result . Oh , and feel free to read and mark my other non-BHM comments as well !
To Kill a Mockingbird is one of the greatest movie experiences ever	In commenting on African-Americans in film in chronological order for Black History Month , we're now at 1962 with the release of the movie version of Harper Lee's novel , " To Kill a Mockingbird " . The crux of the story is lawyer Atticus Finch's ( Oscar-winning performance of Gregory Peck ) defending black farmer Tom Robinson ( Brock Peters ) against the testimony of Mayella's ( Collin Wilcox Paxton ) accusation of her rape by him . These scenes are some of the most touching and intense I've ever seen of a movie made while there was still a Production Code in effect ( though the rules of that Code were relaxed by this time compared to the ' 30s and ' 40s ) . Peter's testimony and , especially , Peck's closing statement were especially touching . Since we're talking about black performers , here's a few more I'd like to mention from this movie : Estelle Evans as Peck's housekeeper for his kids-this actress is the sister of Esther Rolle from " Good Times " , David Crawford as Tom's son David , Jester Hairston-who I remember from " Amen " - as Tom's father Spence , Kim Hamilton as Tom's wife Helen , and Bill Walker as the Rev . Sykes who says perhaps the most famous line in the movie , " Jean Louise , stand up , your father is passing . " ( I had earlier misquoted this line in a review of the " Our Gang " comedy , Young Sherlocks , which starred his wife , Peggy Cartwright , as a child ) Others in the cast are Kim Stanley who's Scout as an adult in narration , Alice Ghostley and William Windon in their film debuts , and , as the children , John Megna-brother of Connie Stevens-as neighbor boy Dill , Philip Alford as Finch's son Jem , and Mary Badham-whose brother John would become a movie director-as Finch's daughter Jean Louise , better known as " Scout " . Then there's Robert Duvall in his scene stealing turn as the silent Boo Radley . What else can I say about this movie produced by Alan J . Pakula , directed by Robert Mulligan , with screenplay adapted by Horton Foote except this is one of the best ever made in my lifetime ! Everyone I've just mentioned was just superb and the score by Elmer Bernstein was a most wonderful addition to this great movie from 1962 . Kudos to Ms . Lee for the only novel she ever published that turned out to be one of the most exhilarating movie experiences I've ever had . So on that note , I definitely recommend To Kill a Mockingbird .
Frosty the Snowman and Peter Cottontail are wonderful recently discovered UPA rarities	I recently discovered on Mark Evanier's site as linked from Cartoon Brew a couple of UPA animated holiday shorts that are on YouTube . One was Peter Cottontail which for some reason is not listed on IMDb . That one played the whole song and depicted visually the entire premise down to the hunter that shot the rabbit's tail . This one , Frosty the Snowman , features the title character's fun with some kids before he leaves so he won't melt away . Both had a chorus that featured no musical accompaniment , just them singing in the standard jazzy style of the period . These were longtime annual staples on Chicago kid shows for years . As a longtime animation fan , these were pleasant surprises . Definitely worth a look .
Angel : City of . . . helps in saying goodbye to the W	Sunday , September 17 , 2006 marked the official end of the WB network . It was marked by the showing of the following pilots : Felicity , Angel , Buffy the Vampire Slayer , and Dawson's Creek . Angel follows the character from BtVS to L . A . where he's been saving various women from vampires by killing them . As the pilot begins , we hear Angel in voice-over talking about the city and why he left Sunnydale to a stranger in a bar . Josh Holloway before he reached stardom in Lost comes in and picks up a woman . We follow him outside where he reveals himself as a vampire to her with a couple of other ones waiting with him . Angel interrupts and manages to slay them all then tells the women he just saved to go away before the opening credits . Later on , we meet Doyle , a demon whose migraines inform Angel of various potential victims and also from Buffy , Cordelia Chase , who moves to L . A . to search for acting stardom . David Boreanaz , Glenn Quinn , and Chrisma Carpenter are fine in the above mentioned roles and while the episodes were originally supposed to be self-contained , like Buffy it's the serialized story lines that we remember . Joss Whedon and David Greenwalt's writing and Whedon's direction are excellent for a genre series pilot and the darker tone sets it apart from Buffy though the humor is quite similar , refreshingly so . In showing Angel on its last broadcast day , the WB is paying tribute to the quality genre series that they helped flourish with . So here's to you WB , may your spirit live on in the CW . . .
Animated short Special Delivery contains one hilarious twist after another !	Just discovered on Thad's Animation Blog this weirdly funny Oscar-winning short directed by Eunice Macaulay and John Weldon . It seems Alice is going out and tells husband Ralph to shovel the walk before he goes to work . He doesn't and when he returns home , he finds the mailman lying dead on the icy pathway . What Ralph does afterwards and the consequences that result changes all three lives ( well , two of them anyway ) forever . . . With the exception of the organ music and the narrator who delivers his lines in the same monotone style throughout , this animated short is silent . Despite the brief running time , Special Delivery has so much going on that every twist the narrator tells and the animators show us earns more laughs than the one before . The only other thing I have to say is I'm so glad I live in a place where it doesn't snow . ( though occasionally there have been exceptions . . . )
Heroes : Genesis is definitely great pilot for new series	From the Star Wars-like crawl in the beginning to the sight of a young man at the top of a tall building in New York imagining he can fly to a teacher in India being told after class that his dad died to a woman stripping on the internet in Las Vegas and having a mirror image that acts opposite of what she does to Japan where an office drone discovers he can control time and teleport to a teenage girl cheerleader in Texas who has skin that heals quickly even after she jumps off a tall stair or saves someone in a fire . . . whew , a lot to take in one episode and there's a few other characters and events I have not mentioned yet . But I loved what I've seen so far and I'm way excited to see what happens next especially when one of my favorites , Greg Grunberg , makes an appearance in the next episode . Heroes is definitely must see for the new season on NBC !
Rock-a-Bye Bear is another great Tex Avery cartoon I just rewatched	When Federator . com linked this cartoon from YouTube and mentioned the short's premise in the blog , I had to watch this again since I remember laughing at it so much in the late ' 70s when I was a kid watching the weekday afternoon " Tom and Jerry " show where Tex Avery's Rock-a-Bye Bear was showcased . In a nutshell , Spike the bulldog has a job to watch a bear stay hibernated during winter . Trouble is , another dog wants that job and since the bear is constantly shouting about wanting complete quiet and usually wakes up at the slightest noise , that other dog does everything in his power to make sure Spike loses his job . Fortunately , Spike always finds a way to go way outside to avoid the sleeping bear's ears . . . Just as hilarious as I remembered it and that bear-voiced by Daws Butler in a Southern loud mouth tone that sounds like a bellicose Huckleberry Hound-provides some of the cartoon's highlights along with all those tricks of that other dog . All I can say after that is , if you love Tex Avery , you'll definitely love this cartoon !
Peter Sellers ' offspring dominate this episode of " Somebody's Daughter , Somebody's Son "	Just watched on YouTube this episode of the British documentary series " Somebody's Daughter , Somebody's Son " . This one looked at Peter Sellers ' children : Michael , Sarah , and Victoria . Michael and Sarah were the kids of Sellers ' first wife , Anne Howe , and Victoria was the child of him and second wife , actress Britt Ekland . Intersperced throughout were clips of many of Peter's movies as well as home movie footage of him with his first wife and their children . There's also several interview footage of Peter and Britt in press conferences and on location . Also discussed were Sellers ' third wife , Miranda Quarry , and fourth one Lynne Frederick who turned out to be his widow . None of the children liked the last one and while Michael ended up writing a book , which Sarah agreed to be interviewed for , about their father after his death , Victoria would be arrested several times as she grew up without him . The home movie footage where Sellers is really enjoying himself with his kids is the most fascinating part of this show and makes one wish he took better care of himself when his heart attacks became fatal . So on that note , this episode of " Sombody's Daughter , Somebody's Son " is well worth seeking out on YouTube .
Walt Disney's The Night Before Christmas is excellent Silly Symphony cartoon	When I was a kid growing up in the ' 70s , the only way you could see any Disney cartoons were on NBC's Sunday evening program The Wonderful World of Disney and they were usually limited to those starring Mickey Mouse , Donald Duck , Goofy , Pluto , and Chip ' n ' Dale . So I was wonderfully surprised to find on YouTube a Walt Disney Silly Symphony classic called The Night Before Christmas . Singer Donald Novis sings the beginning verses of that famous poem as we see several children sleeping and then Santa comes with his bag of toys coming to life decorating the Christmas tree . The toys are having lots of fun but while Santa plays the toy piano , the children wake up . The toys get into their boxes and Santa goes back up the chimney as all the kids unwrap their toys . The littlest one named Junior gets a cute Scottish dog as the singer croons the very last verses : " Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night . " By the way , this cartoon has a little butt cleavage with Junior that I was a bit surprised to see . I am thinking the Production Code eventually put an end to that soon enough ! Very enjoyable Silly Symphony that should put the Christmas spirit in anyone under 10 right away . Highly recommend to any Walt Disney animation buff .
Yes , Virginia , There Is a Santa Claus is another charming animated holiday special from Bill Melendez	" He will continue to make glad , the heart of childhood . " So answered New York Sun editor Francis Church at the end of his editorial to one Virginia O'Hanlon one day in 1897 to her question of is there a Santa Claus . Taking a break from the " Peanuts " specials , director Bill Melendez put the same charm he visualized in those on this one to sentimental effect with once again children voicing the kid characters . I loved the scene between that street cop Virginia asked about the red-suited man and that cop's superior on the phone and his reply to Virginia about what that superior said about Santa . And how nice was it to hear Jim Backus as the narrator here . Since I don't want to spoil anything , you'll have to watch this to find out who he's supposed to be in relation to the story . So , yes , that's a recommendation . . .
Great Old Amusement Parks is a great doc about park rides that were popular before Disneyland	A fascinating look at many of the longest-running amusement parks in the United States of America , some in operation since the late nineteenth century . As expected , many Coney Island parks in Brooklyn are covered as well as some in the Midwest like the Holiday World in Santa Claus , Ind . ( This is the town that millions of " Dear Santa " letters go to every Christmas season ) . That park also has 4th of July and Halloween sections besides the Christmas section . Two of the most fascinating segments concerned the Playland park in Rye , N . Y . which has a real rough merry-go-round ride called The Derby Rider which is so fast that many employees who jump on while it's moving have to really rush on quickly and then just lean a certain way so they don't fall down ! Then there's a coaster in San Diego that had a contest one year in which several people literally stayed on ( excepting breaks , of course ) for several days ( maybe months ) with the last one to still be on to get the $50 , 000 from radio station Star 100 . 7 . Many interviewed told the narrator what dreams they had for the money . Many-in fact , five-of them were still there when the station called off the contest by Labor Day as they each got $12 , 500 and a trip for two to Hawaii . To sum up , if you love learning about vintage amusement parks that are still running to the present day , Great Old Amusement Parks is for you .
How to Eat Your Watermelon . . . provides unique insight on Melvin Van Peebles	Having previously seen Sweet Sweetback . . . , Watermelon Man , his son Mario's Badaaaasssss ! , I took one look at this documentary on DVD at my local library and had to check this out quickly ! What a fascinating look at Melvin Van Peebles ' life and various careers ( as a side note , I was pleasantly surprised finding out here that he was born in Chicago , Ill . which is also my birthplace ) . From train conductor to Air Force pilot to French novelist to filmmaker to musician , Van Peebles seems to have done it all and I haven't even mentioned Wall Street trader ! However , because of his independent streak-Watermelon Man being his only Major Studio film-Melvin is not always respected . He's never out , however , and seems to treat his jobs like he treats women-one day at a time ! Nice insights from fellow filmmakers Gordon Parks and Spike Lee but the real treats are of his children Max , Megan , and especially Mario who had played his father in one of the titles I mentioned . While the Sweetback movie gets the lion's share of attention here , we also see snippets of Story of a Three Day Pass , the Watermelon pic , his televised musical play " Ain't Supposed to Die a Natural Death " , his musical movie-Don't Play Us Cheap-from the ' 70s , and the one he was shooting at the time-Bellyful . There's also some bonus features of some of his concert performances and of his commentaries he did for a New York TV station . The most hilarious of those was on his seeing " X-Rated " movies as a child which he defined as those that portrayed his race in a demeaning manner ! Witty and refreshing , How to Eat Your Watermelon in White Company ( and Enjoy It ) is a must for a look at this multi-talented man .
So You Want to Be in Pictures was a most hilarious Joe McDoakes short	This is my fourth Joe McDoakes short that I've seen and so far the funniest one . In this one , Joe takes voice lessons from a record impersonating Charles Boyer and Ronald Colman . When he goes to Warner Bros . Studio ( the company behind this series , incidentally ) , he asks Jack Carson for directions which gets both confused . Then he encounters actor George O'Hanlon ( who's also McDoakes ) who speaks in his more normal voice that's not too far from his later Geroge Jetson and gets to the set where he automatically upsets the director . I'll stop there and just say how funny I found the whole thing and was fascinated by the movie star cameos provided near the end . The final scene was especially a hoot so on that note , go to YouTube if you want to watch So You Want to Be in Picutres !
" Figure Eight " is one of several cherished memories I have of " Schoolhouse Rock "	I just rediscovered this animated musical short-part of the " Schoolhouse Rock ! " series that aired in between the cartoons on ABC Saturday morning-on YouTube . They bring such great memories of watching these educational but entertaining shorts while I was a kid during the ' 70s . This one-with lyrics by Bob Dorough as sung by Blossom Dearie-depicts a little girl dreaming of skating the figure eight while doing so on thin ice . Now , while she does fall down , she also gets up jumping while shaking as the music changes from solo piano ballet to up-tempo pop . And the beginning-with the children going to a one-room building-also began the " Schoolhouse Rock ! " series proper when I first watched these as a child . After all these years , these animated musical shorts are still worth seeing so on that note , I heartily recommend these for the new generation seeking fun in education . Guess I'll review another one . . .
The Pancake Batter Anomaly is one of the funniest episodes of " The Big Bang Theory " yet	When Penny returns from her hometown in Nebraska , she tells Leonard and Sheldon that many of her immediate family had the flu . That signals Sheldon to keep away from her since he's a germaphobic . When Sheldon does get sick , Leonard decides to ditch him to watch a Planet of the Apes marathon at a cinema with Howard and Raj . So , ironically , Penny ends up taking care of Sheldon by rubbing vapor rub on him and singing a song his mother warbled to him . After Leonard found out on his cell phone , he and his buddies sneak back in with an upset Penny waiting . . . This was one of the most hilarious episodes I've seen this season ! From Sheldon's various sickness reactions to Penny's flabbergasted indignities to Leonard , Howard , and Raj's shenanigans , this was such a top-notch outing ! And I loved Howard's quoting of the " dirty paws off my popcorn " line from the first Apes outing since I watched this a few weeks after the originator of that one , Charlton Heston , recently died . One more thing , Chuck Lorre made his 200th vanity card here and tells us . . . how lonely he is . He can't be too much so since he now has two hit TV shows in a row !
Citizen King is essential viewing for anyone studying Dr . Martin Luther King	With today another celebration of the birth of Dr . Martin Luther King , I finally decided to watch the documentary made about his last five years that aired on " American Experience " that I taped four years ago . Following his Birmingham stint to his march in Washington , D . C . to his trips to the Johnson White House to his Nobel Peace Prize to his demonstrations in Chicago to protest poverty there to his opposition to the Vietnam War and his fallout with the President and finally to Memphis in support of the garbage strike there and his eventual assassination , we get compelling present-day testimony from many of his friends and colleagues like Andrew Young . Many news footage and home movies of Dr . King also abound to show how he presented himself publicly . While much of the current interviews still hold the reverend in high esteem , there's also some that mention his adultery and his occasional employment of Communists not to mention his not-so-cordial encounters with FBI chief J . Edgar Hoover . With all that I just mentioned , I'll just say that I highly recommend Citizen King .
Rabbit of Seville is a masterpiece of classical music and animation	When Bugs starts cutting a razor to Elmer's face , I couldn't help but think about the recent movie of Sweeney Todd , in which that character is a barber who literally cuts his customers ' necks . Luckily , the rabbit just gives his nemesis slashes . Loved hearing Mel Blanc as the rascally rabbit sing the altered lyrics to the famous opera as he keeps Elmer unconscious in the barber chair . Too bad Arthur Q . Bryan couldn't contribute his own Fudd voice to the proceedings but Chuck Jones made up for that when he made What's Opera Doc ? years later . Musically compelling as well as pretty hilarious , Rabbit of Seville is a gem among gems in the Jones-Michael Maltese cannon of Warner Bros . cartoons . Well worth seeing for classical music and classic animation fans .
Bugs and Thugs was one of my favorites as a kid	Bugs goes to the bank to get a carrot among many in his deposit box . At the same time , Rocky has robbed it and is about to get in his car with Mugsy as the driver when Bugs comes in first mistaking it for a taxi . When Rocky comes in with his bags of money , the rabbit at first thinks it's laundry . He wises up and attempts to call the police at a nearby gas station but is caught by Mugsy before he can complete it . It all results in one of the funniest police captures in cartoon history ! This was one of my favorites as a little kid and seeing it today on The Looney Tunes Golden Collection , Vol . 1 brought back great memories of watching this on " Bugs Bunny and Friends " which aired every afternoon at 3 : 30 pm central time on WRBT-TV , Baton Rouge , La . ( It's now WVLA ) . Kudos once again to Friz Freling .
Midnight Express Special is an excellent episode of SCTV	On Sunrise Semester , Edith Prickly ( Andrea Martin ) plugs her passport photo business with her cousin ( Robin Duke ) the participant . Funniest scene is when Duke gets blown by a giant fan that probably wasn't necessary . Oh , and she's drunk the whole time ! On a Mamorex tape spot , Ella Fitzgerald ( Joe Flaherty ) is confused if Rickie Lee Jones ( Duke ) and Tom Waits ( Rick Moranis ) are live or on tape . On the Great White North , Bob McKenzie ( Moranis ) discusses the topic of whether to bowl while loaded . Brother Doug ( Dave Thomas ) seems to be saying no since his ball went over three lanes and he puked in the gutter to where the guy who fixed the pins got it . Doug then asks his brother to impersonate the " little guy " which Bob does a little embarrassingly . Next , Bill Needle ( Thomas ) comes on and complains about being limited to three seconds just as he's being grabbed off . Then SCTV President Guy Caballero ( Flaherty ) comes on and mentions a show from Turkey being aired on the network via satellite and needing $10 , 000 " per person " to keep such shows on the air . The show is " Midnight Express Special " hosted by Abbott ( Eugene Levy ) and Costello ( Tony Rosato ) in faux-wrinkled black and white footage mixed with recreations of the movie Midnight Express . Guests John Denver ( Moranis ) , Anne Murray ( Duke ) , and Randy Newman ( Thomas ) all get frisked by the Turkish guards . Abbott and Costello were also supposed to introduce The Band but Costello keeps getting them mixed up with The Who , Yes , and The Byrds . There was also a network promo for Today , Tomorrow and Yesterday . . . This is a very funny episode with the highlight being the " Who's On First " takeoff I just mentioned . Also loved Bob and Doug McKenzie who were the Wayne's World of the day , i . e . two characters who were very popular outside of the show . I watched this on SCTV : Best of the Early Years on DVD . Well worth the purchase .
