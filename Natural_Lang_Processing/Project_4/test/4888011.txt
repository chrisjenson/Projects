hands of fate , brains of idiocy	" ' Manos ' the Hands of Fate " is another grade-Z litany of worthlessness . A family is on vacation and drives up to what looks like an abandoned hotel run by semi-hunchback Torgo , who can't stop talking about his " master " . When we finally meet the master , he turns out to be the Devil's servant , and he's got evil plans for the family . How many times have we seen this kind of story ? ! Fortunately , " MST3K " saved the movie . Mike , Servo and Crow really liked the scene where the master's scantily clad wives were having a fistfight ( there weren't really any other memorable scenes in the movie ) . On it's own , " MTHOF " is a total zero , but the " MST3K " version is a .
this movie will only stick in my memory because it made a great " MST3K " episode	A muddled story of computer programmer Aram Fingal ( Raul Julia ) who works for vicious corporation Novicorp . They transfer his mind to that of a baboon ( a good metaphor for the whole movie ) , and from there , Aram gets caught in the computer and creates his own world , in which he gets to be Rick from " Casablanca " . One of his co-programmers ( Linda Griffiths ) tries to help him get back into the real world . It's little more than a " Tron " ripoff . Trying too hard to be funny , the whole thing ends up idiotic . Granted , the movie wasn't a total waste : " MST3K " did a great job ripping it apart . What is really hard to believe is that Raul Julia starred in " Overdrawn at the Memory Bank " the same year that he starred in " Kiss of the Spider Woman " !
Exactly the sort of movie that Joe Bob Briggs should present .	Typically stupid mixing of genres , to the point where the title gives us an inaccurate description ( it's the granddaughter , not daughter ) . Of course , the title should identify that " Jesse James Meets Frankenstein's Daughter " is anything but a serious movie , so as long as you accept it as totally ridiculous , it should be OK . On the DVD case , Joe Bob Briggs - I assume that you know who he is - explains that this was not only the final film of director William Beaudine ( aka One Shot Beaudine , as he didn't like to film things more than once ) , but also the final film of many of the cast members ; when you watch the movie , that part is pretty self-explanatory . All in all , this is your basic B-movie . No , actually it's more like a C-movie ( oh , let's just say Z-movie ) . Very dumb .
Back when Ernest Borgnine won an Oscar for " Marty " , who would have ever thought that one of his movies would be " MST3K " - worthy ?	" Merlin's Shop of Mystical Wonders " is too dark to be a children's movie and too cute to be a horror flick . Which makes it perfect " Mystery Science Theater 3000 " fodder ! An incompetent mixture of " Poltergeist " and any wizard movie , it makes one wonder how they got a great actor like Ernest Borgnine on board . Although the movie has 1996 as its date , a large portion of it looks as though it was filmed at least ten years earlier ( a very corny ' 80s look ) . As for the " MST3K " version , jokes naturally abound . I don't remember which jeers came from Mike , Servo or Crow , but someone notes that Merlin probably shouldn't ask women if they've seen his monkey ! And when the ground starts caving in , one of them declares that Bugs Bunny must have missed that left turn at Albuquerque ! Among the famous people who get mentioned are Tom Bosley , Madeline Albright , Bella Abzug and Linda Blair . So just stick with the " MST3K " version and you'll be fine . Yeah , she did look kinda like Julie Hagerty .
" Rounders " is totally flat .	You know how there's supposed to be the " Oscar curse " , when a person wins a gold statuette and proceeds to star in a really worthless movie ? Well , it happened to Matt Damon . After he and Ben Affleck won writing Oscars for " Good Will Hunting " , they both starred in some real turkeys : Affleck in the god-awful " Armageddon " and Damon in the go-nowhere " Rounders " . This is supposed to be about high-stakes gambling , but the whole thing runs as if the actors are on depressants . There isn't a likable or memorable character anywhere in the movie . So there's the possibility that a screw-up might lead to danger ? Well , watching this movie , I wished that something would happen to the worthless characters . AND WHY DOES THE GANGSTER ( John Malkovich ) HAVE TO BE Russian ? ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! The point is , you should avoid this movie at all costs . There are plenty of good movies out there , so there's no reason to waste your time on this junk . Also starring Edward Norton , John Turturro , Martin Landau and Gretchen Mol .
dangerous because there have been better movies	Another movie about an honest white teacher fixing a bunch of black ghetto teenagers . " To Sir , with Love " did a much better job with this topic , and both Michelle Pfeiffer and George Dzundza have had far superior roles than " Dangerous Minds " . Personally , I would like to see a movie in which a black person from the ghetto teaches rich white kids how to live like ghetto people . Yeah , sort of like how Steve Martin looked in " Bringing Down the House " . But my point is that there are much better movies out there , so don't make this your first choice . I just wonder , what was the last good movie starring Michelle Pfeiffer ? I know that she's had good roles , but when was the last time ?
Chevy Chase , he fell from grace . . .	Some events are just so ironic that they just seem too weird to be true . One of the best examples , at least in my opinion , is what happened to Chevy Chase . You see , in the ' 80s he was one of the top stars , with movies like " Vacation " and " Fletch " . Now , he was not friends with the president during that period , nor with the next president , but he was friends with Bill Clinton . That's where it gets bizarre : a few months after Slick Willie took the oath of office , Chase got his own TV show . . . and it failed miserably , turning Chase into a laughingstock . In short , Chevy Chase went from a star under his enemies to a joke under his friend . To compound this , the show's failure was followed by embarrassing movies like " Cops and Robbersons " and " Man of the House " . I will say that the latter isn't god-awful , but it's not really worth much . Mostly just another story about a son and stepfather trying to bond . If nothing else , I guess that it just seems sad that Chase went from " SNL " to this ( maybe it's also the flick's status as a Disney movie ) . But really , Chase has done better than this , as have Farrah Fawcett and George Wendt . Don't make it your first choice .
Still , I prefer Errol Flynn and Cary Elwes .	When I was young , my favorite scene in Disney's version of " Robin Hood " was always the battle following archery tournament ( you gotta admit , it would be cool to experience that ) . Otherwise , it seems like the whole thing is sort of a Disney movie : a classic story turned into a jolly musical , with some comic relief here and there . So , it's not a terrible movie . I just prefer the Errol Flynn version , and Mel Brooks's spoof of the Kevin Costner version ( plus the short cartoons starring Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck ) . OK for some brief entertainment . So yes , let's point that pea-shooter the other way .
actually , it's not all that simple	The world was introduced to Joel and Ethan Coen when the two brothers released the confusing " Blood Simple . " The convoluted plot involves . . . something . A man hires a detective to kill his cheating wife and her lover , but nothing is what it seems . I think that that's the plot . I'd say that this is really a movie for the Coen brothers ' hard-core fans ; others won't have a clue what the hell's going on . Obviously , after this , the Coens got more " mainstream " ( " Raising Arizona " , " Fargo " , " The Ladykillers " ) , and a previous reviewer even complained about that . Well , unless you're truly willing to spend 99 minutes trying to pinpoint what exactly John Getz , Frances McDormand , Dan Hedaya and M . Emmet Walsh are doing , you'll want to avoid this . OK , but not for the fainthearted .
Don't treat it as serious , people !	A previous reviewer called " 2001 : A Space Travesty " one of the stupidest and worst comedies ever . Describing like that implies that it was meant to be taken seriously . This one isn't meant to be taken seriously . Like any Leslie Nielsen movie , it's an excuse to be silly . It casts him as a marshal sent to outer space to stop a coup , but the plot of course isn't important . The movie's purpose is to have Leslie Nielsen get into a series of embarrassing situations - that is , embarrassing for him , a hoot for us . Granted , this one doesn't quite reach the standards set by the " Naked Gun " movies , but it has its share of laughs ( particularly the opening scene ) .
yeah , it's like that	The offensively portrayed Inki continues his hunt throughout the jungle , antagonizing a lion . It's no surprise that cartoons like " Inki and the Minah Bird " are harder to find than Warner Bros . ' s most famous cartoons , given how they drew Inki . It's very much a product of the old style Euro-American view of Africa . I get the feeling that these cartoons won't come to DVD anytime soon . If Warner Bros . brings these to DVD , they should put them in a section identifying that these were creations of a pre-conscious era . There were a number of their cartoons like this ; others included " Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs " . Good to see as a historical reference .
land of the midnight scum	OK , so the northernmost city in the United States goes through a month of darkness with vampires - whose origin never gets identified - roaming the streets looking for blood . If the people in Barrow saw " 30 Days of Night " , they probably spent half the time identifying inaccuracies ( namely how the sun set straight down , when in reality Barrow's location above the 70th parallel means that the sun rises and sets at about a 20 degree angle ) . The characters are what I have come to expect in these sorts of movies . There's the hero ( Josh Hartnett ) , his tough-but-delicate blonde hubby ( Melissa George ) , and most everyone else exists to blurt out comments and eventually get slaughtered . I understand that the vampires ' origins might not add to the story , but I would have liked to know whence they came ; if the movie's gonna go so far as to give them their own language , at least explain their history . So , if you just like to see gore , then this is definitely the movie for you . But the vampire movies that I recommend are " Nosferatu " ( both the original and the remake ) , the 1931 " Dracula " ( how can you not admire Bela Lugosi ? ) , the 1958 " Dracula " ( they started showing gore ) , " Dracula : Dead and Loving It " ( directed by Mel Brooks and starring Leslie Nielsen ; enough said ) , John Carpenter's " Vampires " , and the Bugs Bunny cartoon " Transylvania 6-5000 " ( the last short in which Chuck Jones directed Bugs Bunny ) . Also starring Danny Huston ( John's son ) and Ben Foster ( Claire's friend on " Six Feet Under " ) .
total kick-ass movie	One of the original action flicks from the ' 80s , John McTiernan's " Die Hard " makes no pretense about being a kick-ass movie . Bruce Willis plays a New York cop John McClane , coming to LA to meet his estranged wife ( Bonnie Bedelia ) . Sure enough , the building in which she works get hijacked by a group of German terrorists . Terrorist leader Hans Gruber ( Alan Rickman in his debut ) , while totally evil , is also quite cultured . Even though the cards look stacked against John McClane , he's ready to take on every one of these terrorists . Twenty years after its release , this movie will probably only appeal to Willis's fans . While mostly a litany of machismo , there are some cringe-inducing scenes ( namely when John has to walk across glass ) . But the movie's main focus is to show Bruce Willis being a tough guy . They do everything possible to make him a superhuman individual to whom we can still relate . All in all , this is a flick that you'll want to avoid if you're into intellectualism . But you'll love it if you're a testosterone-driven dude . I think that I'm content having seen it only once . Also starring Alexander Godunov ( one of the Amish farmers in " Witness " ) , Paul Gleason ( the principal in " The Breakfast Club " ) and William Atherton ( the EPA agent in " Ghostbusters " ) . I wouldn't mind getting to ride off into the sunset with Grace Kelly .
" Life of Brian " is my favorite biblical epic	Anyone who's read any of my reviews of most musicals and / or epics will most likely know that I only watch them so that I can trash-talk them a la " Mystery Science Theater 3000 " . " The Greatest Story Ever Told " would be perfect fodder for that show . Among my heckling remarks were : " Son , when you reign . . . " - " . . . you'll pour . " " All the tribes on the earth . . . " - " . . . she had to come to mine . " " Hosanna ! " - " Oh , Hosanna , don't you cry for me ! We got a new religion and it's gonna set us free ! " Sorry if I offend religious people , but having been raised without religion , I take none seriously ( Bill Maher's documentary " Religulous " pretty much displays my opinion of organized religion , although I think that Maher could have done better ) . As for the characters . First off , it makes no sense to cast white people like Max von Sydow and Claude Rains as biblical figures . The stories took place in the Middle East , so they should have all been at least swarthy ; Sidney Poitier , Jamie Farr and Michael Ansara ( Barbara Eden's then-husband ) were the only cast members who looked accurate . Apparently , when someone asked George Stevens why he cast so many top stars - among them Carroll Baker , Pat Boone , Angela Lansbury , Roddy McDowall , Dorothy McGuire and John Wayne - in small roles , Stevens asserted that in later years people wouldn't know who these actors / actresses are and would judge the whole movie on its merits . Well , I know who most of these people are / were . One of the things that I judge is that the movie comes across as a lead weight . And that Charlton Heston turns John the Baptist into a real wise guy , and that it's hard to watch Telly Savalas as Pontius Pilate and not think of Savalas's other roles . In my opinion , the important thing to understand about Jesus is that he was basically a revolutionary . Judea was a hierarchical society with the colonizing Romans collaborating with the king and the religious institution , and then along comes this carpenter who starts speaking for the masses . The fact that people wanted to free murderer Barrabas goes to show that in a frenzied-up society , a revolutionary is considered more dangerous than a murderer . I actually didn't learn the story of Jesus until my parents and I went to Paris when I was ten . Going to the museums and seeing the paintings depicting biblical scenes , my mom decided that she'd better explain to me what the story was . For the record , by the age of five , I could identify the people behind the Bugs Bunny cartoons ( Mel Blanc , Chuck Jones , Friz Freleng , etc ) . Long story short , I don't recommend this movie , unless it's for a film class . Also starring Michael Anderson , Joanna Dunham , Van Heflin , Martin Landau , David McCallum , Donald Pleasance and Shelley Winters .
Your mission , Mr . Graves , should you choose to accept it , is to start out in giant bug movies	Typical giant bug movie . Nuclear fallout turns regular grasshoppers into truck-sized killing machines . Scientist Ed Wainwright ( Peter Graves ) tries to figure out how to stop the over-sized insects ( the solution may or may not be nuking Chicago ) , while reporter Audrey Ames ( Peggie Castle ) investigates the whole thing and falls for Ed . As expected , the whole thing is quite laughable ( somehow , Illinois has California-style hills ) , although Audrey is actually pretty hot . If you really want to watch this movie , then watch the " MST3K " version . Mike , Servo and Crow really have some fun with this one , as you might imagine .
Abbott and Costello needed the Ghostbusters	I prefer it when comedies don't have people occasionally break out into song ( leave that to Gene Kelly , will ya ! ) . But once the unnecessary songs in " Hold That Ghost " are over , the movie gets going . Bud and Lou play gas station attendants Chuck Murray and Ferdinand " Ferdie " Jones , who inherit a murdered gangster's fortune . The fortune is located in what appears to be a haunted house . Since Ferdie gets freaked out by every little thing , you can probably guess what sorts of things happen in the house . The more Lou irks everyone , the more you want him to do so . I really liked the room switching scene . Maybe " Hold That Ghost " was old-school , but it was good for a few laughs .
racist yes ( but still worth seeing )	Obviously , it's hard to laugh at " All This and Rabbit Stew " nowadays , given the blatantly racist caricature . The cartoon features Bugs Bunny teasing an African-American hunter . I have to admit that some scenes are quite funny - that whole sequence with the bullets was a real hoot - but how can we judge the rest ? As long as we understand what the cartoon portrays , it's possible to . . . well , I don't know whether I can say enjoy it . As the cartoon is almost certain to offend African-Americans , I don't know what more I can say . I do recommend seeing it just to understand stereotypical characterizations .
curtain razor	Taking a break from his goof-ball roles , Bill Murray starred in this serious movie about a man's search for meaning . " The Razor's Edge " is an interesting movie alright , but I guess that it's one of those situations where they throw so much philosophical stuff at you that it's hard to digest . Is Bill Murray the right choice for the role , or is he totally miscast ? Well , in recent years , he's taken a number of serious roles , so there's nothing wrong with him taking one here ; still , considering that this was the same year as " Ghost Busters " , you almost expect him to blurt out something silly . No matter , he does a very good job in the role . Worth seeing , if only once . Also starring Theresa Russell , Catherine Hicks and Denholm Elliott .
Happy 60th , Susan !	Since today is ( well yesterday was ) Susan Sarandon's 60th birthday , I saw fit to review one of her lesser known movies ( actually , it's Kevin Kline's movie ) . " January Man " is not a movie that I really know how to describe . Kevin Kline plays Nick Starkey , an ex-cop who gets drug back into the force to help find a serial killer . It's certainly a common plot . This one toes the line between thriller and love story ; I guess that neither is supposed to dominate . I would say that the movie's main strength lies in the various kinds of characters portrayed . Aside from Kline's ex-cop and Sarandon as his wife , there's the new love interest ( Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio ) , Nick's brother ( Harvey Keitel ) , the tough captain ( Danny Aiello ) , and the old-order mayor ( Rod Steiger ) ; Alan Rickman also stars . So , did I think that this was a good movie ? I don't know what it really was . An interesting group of people with an anticlimactic ending , more than anything . I suppose that the movie's worth seeing , if only once .
dying to explain	" Passed Away " is the sort of movie that you could easily walk by in the video / DVD store and not notice . But you should notice it , and then watch it . This is actually a very clever movie . It looks at how this family has to deal with their problems following the father's death . Although Bob Hoskins is listed as the star , no single character really dominates the movie . We get to see the issues faced by everyone , and the movie leaves it up to the viewer to decide what to think of the various characters . So this is one that I recommend . You won't be disappointed if you take the time to check it out . Also starring Peter Riegert ( Boone in " Animal House " ) and Tim Curry .
The end of Mel Blanc .	So , Mel Blanc lent his voice to a cartoon short for the last time . It was an OK effort . Maybe not quite like their work from the ' 40s and ' 50s , but a colorful jab at classic horror flicks , as Daffy Duck dreams that he's performing for an audience of monsters . . . until he antagonizes Godzilla . And with another Mel ( Torme , that is ) doing the singing , how can you go wrong ? All in all , " The Night of the Living Duck " was a worthy end for The Man of 1 , 000 Voices . And he left this life the very next year ( he was actually the first famous person whose death I was aware of ; I was only five years old , but I knew the names of Bugs Bunny's creators ) . You can luxuriate in Mel Blanc's voices and Carl Stalling's music ( happy birthday , Carl ! ) .
one of those movies that you never expect	In 1992 , when " Sneakers " came out , the Internet was just getting off the ground . What they portray in this movie seems more like what one would expect to find in a 21st century movie . Robert Redford and Sidney Poitier play hackers , with an entire syndicate made up of Dan Aykroyd , David Strathairn and River Phoenix . Following a few strange incidents , the whole group finds itself involved in a vast , bizarre scheme . The movie isn't totally easy to follow , but the occasional comedic bits make up for that ( namely the Scrabble scene , the voice recording , and the end ) . Not any kind of masterpiece , but worth watching nonetheless , what with its mixture of suspense and goofiness .
La Cucaracha dances	True , Friz Freleng's early cartoon " The Lady in Red " stereotypes Mexico a little bit , but it's got some cool scenes , as a bevy of cockroaches party in a café after hours . The title woman performs a sultry dance . But then a parrot sees the action and gets hungry . That's instinct , I guess . As this came out in the early days of Warner Bros . animation , there's none of the full scale wackiness that became their cornerstone throughout the ' 40s and ' 50s . As it was , I notice that a lot of their cartoons in 1935 and 1936 took their titles from songs : " I Haven't Got a Hat " ( mostly famous as Porky Pig's debut ) , " I Love to Singa " and " Let It Be Me " . Anyway , an OK cartoon . Available on YouTube .
let's all be witches	Anyone watching " I Married a Witch " would probably want to start engaging in a little witchcraft . Veronica Lake is great as witch Jennifer , who with her father ( Cecil Kellaway ) was burned alive 270 years ago . But now they've both been freed - by lightning striking the tree that imprisoned them - and want to get revenge on the descendant of their executioner . It turns out , this descendant ( Frederic March ) is running for governor . As we movie watchers should all know , political campaigns make for some great humor on the silver screen . As an example of how great the humor here is likely to end up , this guy is about to get married ! Everything ends up in a zany whirlwind . This movie deserves more recognition that it has gotten . I would say that it has done almost as much to advance the cause of witchcraft as " Bewitched " ( which also featured a really hot witch ) and the Looney Tunes cartoons starring Witch Hazel . In short , this movie definitely has me in its spell .
Oh , when will the cats ever learn ?	Once again , some less-than-intelligent cats go after Speedy Gonzales , only to have him foil every one of their schemes . OK , so not only do pretty much all of Speedy's cartoons have basically the same plot , but they totally stereotype Mexico . Well , as I understand it , many Hispanics like that these cartoons portray our southern neighbor positively . So , Speedy does his usual stuff in " Mexicali Shmoes " , always showing himself to be one cool dude ; no wonder all the female mice love him . As for his cousin Slowpoke Rodriguez ( the slowest mouse in Mexico ) . . . well , clearly he has a reason for existence . Anyway , this one's worth seeing .
a " league " of all nations	No doubt everyone's heard about Rosie the Riveter , but the women's baseball team seems to not be as well remembered . " A League of Their Own " is the story of this team . Various women from all over come to participate , although the movie mostly focuses on Dottie Hinson ( Geena Davis ) , Mae Mordabito ( Madonna ) , and the manager Jimmy Dugan ( Tom Hanks ) . I've never really been a baseball fan , so maybe I'm not the right person to be reviewing this movie , but I thought that it was pretty well done . There was one particular line that seems to have been thrown in for comic relief ( I mean what Jimmy says after getting chewed out by the umpire ) . But overall , Penny Marshall has shown herself to be very adept as a director , with this and " Awakenings " . Worth seeing . Also starring Lori Petty , Jon Lovitz , David Strathairn , Bill Pullman , Garry Marshall ( the director's brother ) and Rosie O'Donnell .
this house is a home for everyone	Steve Martin is his usual uptight wacko and Goldie Hawn is her usual ditsy blonde in this story of a screwy woman invading an architect's life . Martin and Hawn are the perfect comic teaming ( it's surprising that they didn't co-star earlier ) , and there are some great scenes here . If one thing's for certain , we can pretty much always guarantee that Frank Oz will turn in a good movie as a director ( he truly does here ) . So check it out . You might just feel like building your own house after watching it . Also starring Dana Delany , Julie Harris and Peter MacNicol . Yeah , that was a good ethics lesson in that one scene .
worth seeing ( pun intended )	In " Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man " , detectives Bud Alexander ( Bud Abbott ) and Lou Francis ( Lou Costello ) have to protect a man framed for murder . This becomes proportionally easier once the man gives himself an invisibility serum . Some of the best scenes are when Lou watches him disappear , when a cop sees ( or , rather , doesn't see ) the man driving a car , and even a scene where Lou accidentally puts a bunch of people to sleep . The end scene is also a shocker . These movies sometimes seem like they were just excuses for everyone to goof off . If so , then they did well . This one was also helped by the fact that it didn't have any songs , which sometimes weakened A & C's movies . Really funny . I guess that I'll have to see this again , now that I know that Fred Mertz appeared in it .
Jane Austen's horror story	If you saw individual random scenes from this movie and didn't know the title or plot , you might end up assuming that it comes from a Jane Austen novel or something . But " - - And Now the Screaming Starts ! " is nothing like that . Oh sure , it's set in England over 200 years ago and deals with a rich guy getting married , but Jane Austen's stories didn't center on curses affecting families . The plot has aristocrat Charles Fengriffen ( Ian Ogilvy of " Witchfinder General " ) marrying young Catherine ( Stephanie Beacham ) and bringing her to his estate in rural England . Once she arrives , strange and horrific things begin occurring . Yeah , it always does seem to happen like that . Still , one has to admire how they set the story up so that you can never be too sure about who's doing what to whom . But for me at least , what's really neat here is when the main idea gets revealed : you think that you now understand everything , but there's still a surprise waiting for you ! Does the movie have any problems ? Well , I thought that Peter Cushing wasn't used as much as he could have been . For that sort of supporting role , they probably should have cast someone else ( then again , Cushing brought a really neat dimension to the movie ) . But overall , I thought that this wasn't a bad movie . I would trust Hammer and / or Amicus to turn out something worth seeing , and the latter doesn't disappoint here . And if I may say so , Catherine was really hot ! Also starring Herbert Lom ( that's right : Commissioner Dreyfus in the Pink Panther movies ! ) , Patrick Magee ( the wheelchair man in " A Clockwork Orange " ) and Geoffrey Whitehead ( Malcolm McDowell's brother in " The Raging Moon " ) .
not gone tamale ( or ever )	Once again , Mexico's rodents call upon Speedy Gonzales to fetch them cheese from Sylvester . In this case , the cheese arrives on a ship that Sylvester is guarding . And of course , no matter what kind of trap Sylvester sets , Speedy uses it against Sylvester ( including something involving Limburger cheese ) . What makes " Here Today , Gone Tamale " particularly interesting is what Sylvester does at the end . One thing about these cartoons is that I actually find them funnier nowadays than when I was younger , as I not only understand the characters ' personalities ( Bugs Bunny is an acerbic New Yorker , Daffy Duck is a blow-hard , etc ) and what the cartoons were spoofing ( " Duck Dodgers in the 24 Century " was spoofing sci-fi flicks ) , but also what the titles were spoofing ; it speaks for itself in this case . But that's just a side note . It's a really funny cartoon .
So what do we think of it nowadays ?	Obviously , when " The Defiant Ones " first came out , it was probably a revolutionary idea : a white man and a black man chained to each other escape from a chain gang and have to put aside their differences to survive . I guess that nowadays , we look at it and feel that they were trying to look good by portraying social issues . No matter , it is a pretty good movie , and Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier do an intense job as John " Joker " Jackson and Noah Cullen , respectively . Not to sound wimpy or anything , but the movie does have a good point in affirming that if we want to accomplish our goals , we do have to accept each other . Stanley Kramer did always have some good ideas for movies , with this one , as well as " Inherit the Wind " , " It's a Mad , Mad , Mad , Mad World " and " Guess Who's Coming to Dinner " .
Now I see : they're portraying totalitarianism .	Whereas it's been a few years since I read the novel on which this movie is based , I had forgotten a few things , so the movie refreshed my memory . Obviously , any book-to-movie adaptation is bound to have at least a few flaws . " Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix " certainly can't equal the book exactly , but I really like Imelda Staunton's role as fascistic Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher Dolores Umbridge ( I assume that if you're reading this , then you know what that class is ; if not , then read the books first ) . This vile woman , dressed like a slightly drabber version of Jackie Kennedy , makes it her goal to overthrow Albus Dumbledore and totally seize control of Hogwarts , engaging in all manner of torture when she deems it necessary , all the while sporting an unctuous smirk . Maybe it's just me , but I derive that this installment in the series is an indictment of totalitarian regimes . Of course , I might just be reading too far into the movie . I figure that the main purpose is probably to get enthralled in the magic , and it's hard not to get enthralled . Admittedly , the younger stars come across as a little silly , as they try to be funny but can't really get it down . No matter , the adults all know what they're doing . A scary but delicious addition here is Helena Bonham Carter as death eater Bellatrix LeStrange . Looking sort of like Elvira , she turns Bellatrix into the sort of character whom we would expect Bonham Carter to play in a Tim Burton movie , and she does this to a tee ; I almost felt scared watching her on screen . Overall , while the movie does have its flaws , I recommend it . I consider it a solid addition in the series . Reprising their roles from the previous installment ( s ) are Daniel Radcliffe , Rupert Grint , Emma Watson , Richard Griffiths , Fiona Shaw , Michael Gambon , Maggie Smith , Robbie Coltrane , Alan Rickman , David Thewlis , Brendan Gleeson , Gary Oldman , Ralph Fiennes , Jason Isaacs and Warwick Davis . Not but a few hours after I watched the movie , I heard a report on the news about a newly released tape divulging the extreme hostility that Richard Nixon felt towards George McGovern , even after winning re-election . Well , Dolores Umbridge is even worse .
size does matter	I notice that " Jack-Wabbit and the Beanstalk " is one of a couple of cartoons in which Bugs Bunny's opponent is a total klutz - complete with a voice like George from " Of Mice and Men " - whom Bugs could clobber without even trying . But even though the giant here is an easy target , it's impossible not to like the wacky series of events ( or the literal ear drum ) . There's one other thing that I notice . This cartoon contains an obvious WWII theme , as the brainless giant claims to be more powerful than Bugs but obviously isn't ( much like the Nazis claimed to be ) . If this is what's going to happen to the US given the current state of affairs . . . well , don't say that they didn't warn us . But I digress . It's a pretty funny cartoon . Other such characters were Beaky Buzzard ( " Bugs Bunny Gets the Boid " ) , Junyer Bear ( " Bugs Bunny and the Three Bears " ) and Pete Puma ( " Rabbit's Kin " ) .
Sylvester must always ' roo the day	Apparently , Benny is so retarded that he believes that all other cats are named George ( in Speedy Gonzales's debut " Cat-Tails for Two " , Benny co-starred with a feline named George ) . In " Hoppy-Go-Lucky " , he and Sylvester are looking for mice , but come across baby kangaroo Hippety Hopper . So , Sylvester - believing HH to be an over-sized rodent - engages in a series of schemes to try and capture the big guy ; oh , and the whole time , Benny thinks that Sylvester is slacking off . That guy's gonna accidentally break someone in half one of these days . So , it's pretty silly , but always a pleasure to watch . I wonder why Sylvester always has to suffer so much .
it makes sense to set this in Texas	Maybe it's a cliché to cast Jeff Goldblum as a nerd in " Powder " , but the movie is actually worth seeing . Portraying an albino teenager ( Sean Patrick Flanery ) upsetting his Texas town via his mental abilities , the movie really gives you a feeling of the Lone Star State . I will admit that a story of people ostracizing a different kind of person has been used many times before , but the whole thing about the title character's mental abilities made this one unique . All in all , this is a movie that I recommend . I noticed that the cop looked like Pat Buchanan - and acted like him too . The aforementioned cast members , plus Mary Steenburgen and Lance Henriksen , all do quite well in their roles . I sure didn't see that ending coming .
Scots do often shorten Alexander to Sandy	One of Norm McCabe's cartoons from his very short tenure as a director at Warner Bros . - he took over Bob Clampett's unit when Clampett took over Tex Avery's , and then Frank Tashlin took over the unit - " Hop and Go " looks like a possible precursor to the Hippety Hopper cartoons . The cartoon portrays a dimwitted kangaroo named Claude Hopper ( his voice is provided by Pinto Colvig , most famous as Goofy in the Disney cartoons ) . A total sucker , Claude never realizes what a pair of sadistic Scottish rabbits are using him for their own personal entertainment ! One of the rabbits is named Sandy . I hear that the Scots do often shorten Alexander to Sandy . Anyway , it's an OK cartoon for the brief entertainment that it provides . McCabe never really got a chance to develop a theme or style in his cartoons - the famous Looney Tunes directors all developed their own styles - but the few of his that I've seen certainly have made me laugh . This one did . Worth seeing , although it probably did function more as a place-holder when it came out ; 1943 saw the release of such greats as " A Corny Concerto " , " Super-Rabbit " , " Pigs in a Polka " and " Porky Pig's Feat " .
that frontier life was something else	Usually , when movie characters utter their movie's title , it's deliberately campy ; or if it's not , then the movie's pretty idiotic . Not so with " The Big Country " . It is actually an epic masterpiece . James McKay ( Gregory Peck ) is a sailor who moves to a Texas ranch in the late 1800s . This is a totally different environment for him , and so not only does he have sort of a hard time adjusting , but his very presence may be turning some people against each other . Some " big " movies were epic to the point of being leaden , but not this one . " The Big Country " always has something good to say about whatever aspect . And Carroll Baker , Burl Ives , Jean Simmons and Charlton Heston all provide some good support , with near perfect direction by William Wyler . This may have been Wyler's best movie ever ( " Ben-Hur " actually was epic to the point of being leaden ) .
" Animal House " goes to war	In one of the many Looney Tunes WWII-themed cartoons , a cat invades a house inhabited by mice and gets them to appease him . But when it becomes clear that he has no desire other than to eat them , they see it as their patriotic duty to defend themselves . What I mean by associating " The Fifth-Column Mouse " with " Animal House " is that not only is the house inhabited by non-human fauna , but that dog-looking tank was sort of like the Deathmobile from which John Belushi emerged dressed as a pirate . I'm probably the only person who would think that . Heck , I'm apparently the first person reviewing this cartoon . Do I like it ? Well , I consider the cartoon worth seeing . It's an OK , not great cartoon . Featured in " Bugs and Daffy : The Wartime Cartoons " .
Tokyo holiday	Obviously , when we go to a foreign country , we're likely to experience some unexpected things . I guess that there's nothing outlandish about the possibility of a burnout actor and a neglected wife growing attached to each other . In " Lost in Translation " , that's just what happens to Bob Harris ( Bill Murray ) and Charlotte ( Scarlett Johansson ) . Alone in the glitzy world of Tokyo , these two souls find in each other just what any isolated person seeks . Along with being a relationship story , " Lost in Translation " is also a look at Tokyo , much the way that " Roman Holiday " was a look at Italy's capital . My favorite scene was the commercial scene . Maybe this movie wasn't any masterpiece , but it certainly was an interesting look at how surroundings - and previous experiences - can affect peoples ' relationships , whether positively or negatively .
Anne Bancroft , RIP	I believe that this was Sydney Pollack's directorial debut . If so , then he certainly gave an interesting insight into his future work . Seattle college student Alan Newell ( Sidney Poitier ) is working at a crisis hotline center when he gets a call from housewife Inge Dyson ( Anne Bancroft ) , who is reaching the breaking point . Because they can't see each other , it gives the movie a real sense of tension , as implied by the title - even if it drags a little bit at times . A previous reviewer said that Poitier plays his usual role : a morally superior black man in a white-dominated society . That's partly true , but here , he has a job that anyone could have , and his race doesn't really matter ( although as the reviewer noted , they could have been subtly talking about race ) . As for Anne Bancroft , her death six months ago brings her filmography to mind . This may have not been her most famous role , but I would recommend it .
Yes , a slice-of-life story from the Soviet Union .	After " Osenniy marafon " ( called " Autumn Marathon " in English ) came out , director Georgi Daneliya couldn't get any work for about two years ; the movie didn't conform to socialist realism in quite the way that the authorities wanted . It portrays Leningrad teacher Andrei Buzykin ( Oleg Basilashvili ) , whose life seems to be going nowhere . His wife barely notices him , and the only thing really resembling joy is when his Danish friend asks him to go jogging every day . But things may be about to change . The title may refer not only to the jogs with his friend , but the possibility that Oleg's life may be about to completely change ( and how he may have to overcome certain obstacles ) . Maybe . And his friend sure had wild hair for a Danish person - I thought that Scandinavian people usually have very straight hair . Now for a little joke . There ought to be a movie called " Autumn Marathon Man " , in which a burnt out Russian teacher gets some unnecessary dental work .
I'd never even heard of " That Girl " before this .	Oh , another awards show ? ! Well , in this case , we get to see individuals whom we rarely get to see . I had only started watching TV Land less than a year before this , and really gotten into some of the shows . It was probably the last time that we would get to see the " Gilligan's Island " cast together before Bob Denver died . One thing that I learned about from " The Second Annual TV Land Awards : A Celebration of Classic TV " was the existence of " That Girl " ; I'd literally never heard of it before then . I was also surprised that John Ritter had hosted the ceremony the previous year a few months before passing away . Oh well . Life goes on . Dick Van Dyke and Andy Griffith look good letting themselves age , while Mary Tyler Moore shouldn't have gotten that face-lift . I guess that I agree with the choices . Oh , and if I may say so , Tina Louise and Barbara Eden are still really hot after all these years !
physical communication	Many Australian movies use the theme of communication issues ( think " Walkabout " , " Picnic at Hanging Rock " , " Crocodile Dundee " ) . Some people might question whether or not " Strictly Ballroom " belongs in that group , but I would say that it does . You see , dancing is a form of physical communication , and so the characters here get to know each other that way . But even ignoring that , it's a pretty fascinating movie . Baz Luhrmann was certainly showing the sorts of things that he would later bring to " Romeo + Juliet " and " Moulin Rouge ! " . Starring Paul Mercurio , Tara Morice , Bill Hunter , Barry Otto and Gia Carides .
Dana Scully and Elwood Blues in the Victorian Era . . . can you dig it ?	No doubt the thought of Gillian " Agent Scully " Anderson and Dan " Blues Brothers " Aykroyd in a movie set during the Victorian Era would probably sound like a joke ; think of it as Leslie Nielsen meets Merchant and Ivory . It turns out that " The House of Mirth " is worth seeing . Anderson plays a woman who risks losing her lover . True , how many Victorian-era stories can there be , but everyone brings a certain charm to this one . Watching the movie , one gets the feeling of how unpleasant life was for women back then , and there's lots of tension amongst everyone to add to the story . Also starring Eleanor Bron ( of " Help ! " fame ) , Terry Kinney , Anthony LaPaglia , Laura Linney , Jodhi May ( of " A World Apart " fame ) , Elizabeth McGovern and Eric Stoltz . I would actually like to see a Victorian-era movie starring Leslie Nielsen .
many aspects	I had never heard of Walter Winchell before Paul Mazursky's movie came out . I was pretty impressed by his movie . We see Winchell's beginnings and rise to mild gossip ( where he started ratting on philandering politicians ) until he became a major part of the political discourse . But there came a major split . While Winchell befriended Franklin Roosevelt and tried to make the Nazis ' actions known to Americans - and went so far as to oppose the bombing of Hiroshima because Harry Truman " didn't do it right " - after WWII he sided with Joe McCarthy and started red-baiting people . When a former girlfriend got blacklisted , he didn't come to her aid . I'm not surprised that few people attended his funeral . Stanley Tucci does a really neat job bringing Winchell to life . You gotta love how he reports on the issues of the day , even if it was sort of a forerunner to infotainment . Christopher Plummer looks almost exactly like FDR , and Paul Giamatti makes Winchell's promoter Herman Klurfeld really something . Also starring is Glenne Headly as the former girlfriend . Overall , I recommend " Winchell " . It shows that Paul Mazursky is in fact a capable director , even if a few of his movies haven't been masterpieces .
Where nothing can possibly go wrong . . .	If people had a chance to experience different eras , they would probably take it . They would probably want to reconsider after watching " Westworld " . It portrays an adult theme park set up to look like the Old West , accompanied by Medieval World and Roman World . Robots play the people in these theme parks . So , Peter Martin ( Richard Benjamin ) and John Blane ( James Brolin ) go to Western World and meet a robot gunslinger ( Yul Brynner ) , killing him multiple times . But then , the robots start going crazy and the humans can't kill them anymore . With " Westworld " , Michael Crichton reminds us what he reminded us with " Jurassic Park " : we shouldn't let science make us too confident . Whether or not we heed that is our decision .
If I could do this . . .	Okay , so " 50 First Dates " is mostly silly , but they do a good job with it . Honolulu veterinarian Henry Roth ( Adam Sandler ) falls for Lucy Whitmore ( Drew Barrymore ) , only to find out that , due to an accident , her memory only lasts one day , so she won't remember him the next day ! How will Henry cope with this ? The movie gravitates between goofy and sensitive , but never gets mind-numbing ; Adam Sandler always has something up his sleeve , and he and Barrymore have a great time with the material . As is often the case in Adam Sandler's movies , one of the characters is an embarrassment to everyone else ( in this case , it's Rob Schneider as Henry's whacked-out friend Ula ) . Great fun . Oh , and one more thing : don't watch " 50 First Dates " if you haven't seen " The Sixth Sense " first .
Oh , to participate in this race !	Sometimes , it's good to think that certain movies have no purpose except to be funny . " The Great Race " is one such movie . You know how in " Dr . Strangelove " , the characters ' names describe who they are ? Well , in this movie , it's even more exaggerated . Set in 1908 , Tony Curtis plays eternally kind stuntman Leslie Gallant III , Jack Lemmon plays the dastardly Professor Fate , Natalie Wood plays photographer Maggie DuBois , Peter Falk plays Fate's assistant Max Meen , and Keenan Wynn plays Gallant's assistant Hezekiah Sturdy . Think that all sounds crazy ? Well , that's just the tip of the iceberg . After Fate and Gallant try to best each other in some stunts ( with the latter always doing better , of course ) , Gallant proposes a New-York-to-Paris race , and so Fate and Maggie enlist . Throughout the race , a series of wacky things happen : a brawl in an old western town , an unwanted trip across the Bering Sea , and a pie fight . When I first saw " The Great Race " when I was eight , the only cast member whom I recognized was Dorothy Provine , as a singer in the old western town - I had previously seen her in " It's a Mad , Mad , Mad , Mad World " ; in the process of watching the movie , I learned the names Tony Curtis , Jack Lemmon , Natalie Wood and Peter Falk ( Falk also starred in " IAMMMMW " , but he didn't appear until very late in the movie , so I hadn't picked up on it ) . Now , when I look at " The Great Race " cast , it's almost hard for me to believe that it also stars Ethel Mertz , Artemus Gordon , Gen . Batguano , Col . Agarn ( from " F Troop " ) and Otis ( from " The Andy Griffith Show ) . Whoa . . . It's pure hilarity from start ( one of Fate's dirty tricks ) to finish ( the French are probably glad that this isn't a true story ) .
Whose destiny turned on this radio ? ( I mean that as a compliment )	A few years before " The Phantom Menace " , George Lucas was involved in the goofy " Radioland Murders " , about a series of killings at a radio station in 1939 Chicago . In a way , the whole movie seems like an excuse for a bunch of gags ( namely the scene where the bellboy accidentally walks into the dressing room ) , but I couldn't help but admire it . Even people who never lived through the ' 30s are likely to feel nostalgia for that era ( uh , can one be nostalgic for the Depression ? ) . Overall , this movie may have no cinematic and / or artistic value whatsoever , but it's just fun to watch . Brian Benben and Mary Stuart Masterson play the lead roles ( and George Lucas said that they're the parents of Richard Dreyfuss's character in " American Graffiti " ) . George Burns , in his final film role , appears as a radio personality . Also starring Ned Beatty , Michael Lerner , Michael McKean , Jeffrey Tambor , Stephen Tobolowsky , Christopher Lloyd , Larry Miller , Anita Morris , and Rosemary Clooney . A fairly neat movie . Oh , and as the movie makes clear : nothing's ever going to overtake radio as the dominant medium .
Mr . Altman , wherever you are , we'll always remember you	Robert Altman's death three days ago brings to mind not only his movies , but his unique style : letting people develop the characters themselves , and overlapping dialogue . In that sense , " Pret-a-Porter / Ready to Wear " is possibly the best example of his movies . One really gets the feeling that they just filmed whatever happened here . This story of a murder in the midst of a Paris fashion show pretty much does whatever it wants , and does a worthwhile job with it . Starring Marcello Mastroianni , Sophia Loren , and a too-long-to-name list of other people . So , in conclusion : thanks for everything , Mr . Altman ! You were one of the greatest directors of all time !
the ' 70s all over again	With the ' 70s nostalgia sweeping the country in 1997-98 , there were several movies to carry it along , including " The Last Days of Disco " . This one portrays some young women in the Me Decade trying to establish relationships and wondering where their lives will lead . I personally thought that Chloe Sevigny carried the movie ( then again , I might just be thinking that because of her role in " Boys Don't Cry " ) . But she and Kate Beckinsale do a great job with the roles . I've never seen any of Whit Stillman's other movies , but if this is any indication , his others must be impressive . Certainly one that I recommend . So does " spurting " count ?
If you film it , certain things will come .	I'm going to admit that it will probably sound a little strange what got me interested in " Field of Dreams " . On " The Simpsons " , " The Itchy & Scratchy " show had an episode called " Field of Screams " , and my parents identified what it spoofed . Also , when Burt Lancaster died , I saw his filmography , and it included this . So I finally saw the movie . What is the movie's overall purpose ? Hard to say , as there are several things that the movie brings up . Certainly it was crazy what Ray Kinsella ( Kevin Costner ) did . Probably my favorite scene was the courthouse , when Annie ( Amy Madigan ) challenges the attacks on Terence Mann ( James Earl Jones ) . But when Mann identified that we elected Nixon twice , it solidly indicates what hypocrites we were . Prior to watching this movie , I'd never really been into baseball ; I'd certainly never heard of the 1919 White Sox scandal . I wonder if I should study it more . Do I consider this flick a masterpiece ? I wouldn't go so far as to say that . But I would say mystifying and definitely worth seeing . Also starring Gaby Hoffman , Ray Liotta , Timothy Busfield and Frank Whaley .
when a rose is more than a rose	Usually , Woody Allen is a director who wishes to avoid Hollywood-style plots , so it's always a surprise when he makes a movie with a deliberately improbably story . " The Purple Rose of Cairo " is an example , with a character ( Jeff Daniels ) in a movie coming out of the movie and into Depression-era New York to be with a down-and-out woman ( Mia Farrow ) . Complete nonsense , you say ? Well , anything can happen in a movie ( especially when there's a movie-within-the-movie ) . Low for Woody Allen , you say ? There aren't any rules about what he can do in movies , his behavior in real life notwithstanding . " TPROC " is a movie and doesn't pretend to be anything else . I recommend it . Also starring Danny Aiello .
school is cool if you can protest apartheid	In what looked like Spike Lee's first " major " movie , different groups of students on a black campus clash over social status , apartheid , and similar things . We can clearly see how the darker-skinned people are more revolutionary , while the lighter-skinned people are a lot creepier ( almost militaristic ) . Maybe parts of " School Daze " seem like they could have used more - perhaps at times it seems preachy - but it's overall a very well done movie . As political activist Dap , Laurence Fishburne is as good as we would expect , and Giancarlo Esposito also does quite well as pro-status quo Julian . Also starring Tisha Campbell , Kyme , Joe Seneca , Ellen Holly , Art Evans , Ossie Davis , Bill Nunn , Branford Marsalis , Kadeem Hardison , Spike Lee and Samuel L . Jackson . And remember : Wake up !
Cheech and Chong will never get old	Basically an excuse for Cheech and Chong to get into a series of marijuana adventures , " Up in Smoke " is a hoot from beginning to end . Pedro De Pacas ( Cheech Marin ) and Anthony " Man " Stoner ( Tommy Chong ) are a pair of slackers who wonder So Cal and Mexico looking for some weed , while the narcs look for any excuse to arrest them . There are some scenes that will probably make your eyes pop out , just due to the surprise factor . You just watch this sort of movie and think " The ' 70s . . . those were the good old days . " Also , it was interesting seeing Strother Martin and Edie Adams as Chong's character's parents . Seeing as to how they were part of my grandparents ' generation , I wouldn't expect to see them in a marijuana movie .
Watch the original , but not the sequels .	When " The Matrix " first came out , it looked like another cheap action flick , but turned out to be quite good . The premise suggests that everything that we see in life is false , and that we're all prisoners of something called the Matrix . So , software designer Thomas " Neo " Anderson ( Keanu Reeves ) is hired by rebel Dr . Morpheus ( Laurence Fishburne ) to break away from society . Lots of impressive things ensue . " The Matrix " was overall a good movie , but would have been better without all the violence . Still , the movie's a classic , with great support from Carrie-Anne Moss , Hugo Weaving , and Joe Pantoliano . Avoid the ridiculous sequels .
spinning outta control , Southern style	Apparently , when " God's Little Acre " first came out , much of it was cut for the theatrical release . Watching the unedited version , one can see why ( needless to say , it's all pretty tame to us in the 21st century ) . Part of it is Tina Louise's very presence - I mean , what man wouldn't want to be stranded on an island with Ginger Grant ? - but there's also a scene where Buddy Hackett works a pump for a woman in a bathtub ( if that scene isn't a double entendre , then I don't know what is ! ) . As for the movie itself , this story of a Georgia farmer ( Robert Ryan ) getting convinced that thar's gold in them thar holes in his garden does quite well . The idea of him tearing up his garden is an effective parallel for how the family gets torn up in the process . As for his friendship with the African-American guy , it's probably debatable whether they were sugar-coating race relations , or if they were encouraging tolerance . There could even be debates about how the movie portrays the South in general ( the characters do come across as hicks ) . But overall , I recommend this flick . Usually , it would sort of weaken the movie to know that some of the cast members later became famous on TV shows - especially since one was known for seducing romantically incompetent men on a certain island - but they all do very well here . This is certainly a movie worth seeing . And the theme song will probably get stuck in your head . Also starring Aldo Ray , Jack Lord , Fay Spain , Vic Morrow and Michael Landon .
not necessarily prophetic , but certainly cool	Whenever a movie stars Christopher Walken , I pretty much suspect that even if the movie itself isn't the greatest , then Walken will almost certainly play a really neat role . Such is the case with " The Prophecy " . The somewhat confusing plot centers on the second war in Heaven between the angels loyal to God and those angry and the big G for giving humans special treatment . One such angel is malevolent Gabriel ( Walken ) , coming to earth to stir up trouble and anger enemy Lucifer ( Viggo Mortensen ) . Only former priest Thomas Daggett ( Elias Koteas ) really has a clue what's going on . Like I said , Walken makes the movie more than your average devil-themed flick . He turns Gabriel into a nasty but cool character , and it looks like Walken is having fun with the role . As it is , the movie wouldn't even need the rest of the cast , or any more dimensions to the plot ; this is Walken's movie all the way . I recommend it , but understand that - despite the religious content - this isn't the sort of movie that's supposed to give you a religious experience . It's intended as a less-than-serious movie , and comes out very enjoyable because of that . Also starring Virginia Madsen and Eric Stoltz . A movie that you might want to watch along with this is " Lord of Illusions " ( they came out around the same time , and I derived some similarities between the two ) . I wonder why religion-themed horror films always seem to focus on Roman Catholicism .
sweet and not sour	In one of filmdom's many biopics , Jessica Lange sinks her teeth into the role of country singer Patsy Cline . We see her go from a bored housewife to a national phenomenon over the period of a few short years before tragically getting killed in a plane crash in 1963 ( although the movie focuses more on her personal life than on her career ) . Not surprisingly , Lange plays the role perfectly . Equally good is Ed Harris as Cline's philandering husband Charlie Dick . " Sweet Dreams " is a movie that has something for everyone . Maybe we wonder how many biopics there can be , but that would miss the point . The point is to understand these people's personal struggles and all . And this movie does a very good job showing that . I wonder whether country music biopics will see a resurgence , now that " Walk the Line " has made a splash .
once again , I see the spoof before I know that there was an original	When I watched Tex Avery's " The Village Smithy " , I assumed that it was an original idea created by the Termite Terrace crowd ; I was more than a little surprised when I read on IMDb that it was based on a Henry Wadsworth Longfellow poem ! But no matter whence it came , it's quite a funny cartoon , as Porky Pig works as a blacksmith's assistant and inadvertently sends his boss on the wildest ride ever . There have been numerous instances in which I've seen a spoof of something while having no idea that it's a spoof . Certainly a number of these instances involved Looney Tunes / Merrie Melodies cartoons ( I saw " What's Opera , Doc ? " long before I'd ever even heard of Wagner's work ) . It's also happened with " The Simpsons " ( I remember when Maggie hit Homer on the head with a mallet and red paint flowed down a drain ; only later did I see " Psycho " and get the reference ) . There are many pop songs that I only learn about because I hear " Weird Al " Yankovic's parodies , and many B-movies that I only see on " Mystery Science Theater 3000 " . I wouldn't be surprised if many members of my generation encounter the spoofs of famous works before encountering the originals . But anyway , this is a pretty funny cartoon . Porky sure did some neat stuff during the two years when he was Warner Bros . top cartoon star . I bet that we all miss some things when we're not looking .
Africans as they see themselves	If absolutely nothing else , " Yeelen " offers a look at a society that we in the west don't often get to see . In this case , it's the Bambara people of Mali ; the movie also includes the Dogon and Fulani . Having taken a sociology-anthropology class , I already knew about them . The plot centers on a warrior having to battle an evil sorcerer who is also his father . I should identify that this is not a movie for people with short attention spans : the action moves along very slowly . But don't worry . Despite how it takes a long time for everything to happen , you feel like you've gotten a lot out of the movie . Above all , I like to see how Africans view themselves as opposed to how we in the west view them . So I certainly recommend this movie .
there's a lot to be said about movies with " sleep " in the title	Contrary to how it may appear , " Sleepaway Camp " is not just another litany of guts getting torn out . For starters , there's the ending ; I sure as hell didn't see that coming ! But beyond that , you do actually get a feel for the characters throughout the movie - particularly after what happens at the beginning - and there are some creative murders ( does it make me an awful person for saying that ? ) . As main character Angela , Felissa Rose creates a girl with whom we can all identify . The rest of the characters gravitate between bitchy and asking-for-it . . . you'll know what I mean if you see the movie . A pretty cool flick . Also , I wonder : what is it about movies with " sleep " in the title ? There's this one , but many different kinds accompany it : " Sleeping Beauty " , " Sleeper " and " Sleepers " , to name a few . It's just something to think about the next time that you go to sleep . But will you be able to after watching this movie ?
the bird , cat and dog who knew too much	While most of the Tweety-Sylvester cartoons have Tweety brutally inflict pain on Sylvester or see the putty tat attacked by Hector the bulldog , " Greedy for Tweety " throws a wrench in the works by having all three get injured at once . When the trio runs into a busy street and each member ends up with a broken leg - does minuscule little Tweety have enough of a leg to actually get broken ? - they get taken to the hospital with Granny as the nurse . Sure enough , Sylvester is still fixated on devouring Tweety ( even if it means abusing Hector ) , while Hector is intent on protecting the little guy ( even if it means abusing Sylvester ) . Many years ago , I saw this cartoon as part of the compilation film " Daffy Duck's Movie : Fantastic Island " . But I'd forgotten some of the coolest scenes ( namely the X-ray and the hammer-wielding mouse ) . As for the idea of Sylvester and Hector fanatically continuing their battle while Tweety sensibly tries to get some rest , maybe that's an allusion to the Cold War : the two superpowers sought to destroy each other while smaller , humbler countries tried to settle down . You know what they say : when all you have is a hammer , everything looks like a nail . OK , so I probably went a little far in trying to analyze this cartoon . The overall point is that " Greedy for Tweety " is truly a fine one . Friz Freleng always had some great ideas .
an interesting perspective	" The Gods Must Be Crazy " is basically two stories that end up colliding . On the one hand , Kalahari Bushman Xixo ( N ! xau ) brings a Coke bottle to his village , and its presence proceeds to wreak havoc . On the other hand , South African reporter Kate Thompson ( Sandra Prinsloo ) goes to Botswana as a teacher , to account for the teacher shortage there ; little does she know that a revolution is brewing . While Xixo is taking the Coke bottle to the " edge of the world " , his world will eventually cross paths with Kate's . Obviously , it now sort of eats at us that they refer to white people as " civilized man " . But overall , the movie does a good job showing what can happen when Western culture is introduced to an indigenous society . I guess that the bad luck often befalling Andrew Steyn ( Marius Weyers ) was just sort of thrown in for comic relief , but you can't not like it .
dogmatic , but true	In talking about Cuba , people often forget about how things were under Fulgencio Batista . The Cuban-Soviet co-production " I Am Cuba " shows how things were . Throughout four vignettes , we see a Havana prostitute struggling to make ends meet , a humble farmer whose livelihood is destroyed by landowners , students fighting against the repressive police , and finally , people joining up with the revolutionary army . The whole thing is really socialist realism : the heroic peasants rising up against the oppressive bourgeoisie and getting martyred . But , we have to admit that what " I Am Cuba " portrays is accurate . I don't know for sure whether or not things got much better after the revolution , but most Cubans certainly prefer things as they are today over how things were under Batista . Either way , the movie can also be interpreted through its camera work , showing Cuba's landscape and employing some interesting dollies . Yes , it's propaganda , but as far as I know , conditions have improved in Cuba ever since they abolished the ladyfinger system and prosecuted Batista's thugs . This movie reminds of things in the same way that " Schindler's List " does .
this truly packs a punch	Calling " Million Dollar Baby " a boxing movie would be like calling " Star Wars " a space fantasy . Only " Rocky " has ever reached this quality . Hilary Swank gives a performance beyond what anyone could ever imagine as destitute waitress Maggie Fitzgerald , trying to make something of herself as a boxer . Clint Eastwood gives probably his best performance ever as trainer Frankie Dunn , trying to reassert his worth by training Maggie . Morgan Freeman is also amazing as co-trainer Eddie " Scrap-Iron " Dupris , seeking a new direction in life . Watching " Million Dollar Baby " you may end up feeling like you are in the middle of a boxing ring . Tough ( but never gratuitously violent ) , disturbing ( but never manipulating emotions ) , this elevates Hilary Swank to the level of Katharine Hepburn , Jane Fonda and Meryl Streep . Her and Morgan Freeman's Oscar wins were more than deserved ( as for Best Picture , I was actually rooting for " The Aviator " ) . But regardless of anything , no one can deny how great this movie is . .
Only Leslie Nielsen could do this !	For sheer goof-ball exuberance , you needn't look any further than " The Naked Gun : From the Files of Police Squad ! " . Leslie Nielsen remains forever associated with the role of inept Lt . Frank Drebin , who always tries to do the right thing but always makes a mess of everything . Here , he's trying to foil an assassination attempt on Queen Elizabeth . Since this is from the people behind " Airplane ! " , it means that much of the humor derives from twisted dialogue and things popping out of the background . To crown it all , there's even a guest appearance by " Weird Al " Yankovic as himself . Also starring are Priscilla Presley , George Kennedy , O . J . Simpson , and Ricardo Montalban . And to think that Leslie Nielsen started out in movies like " Forbidden Planet " !
must have been Daffy's relative	When the mice set up a mini-carnival for Cinco de Mayo , a loopy vulture ( or crow ; I'm sure not totally sure which he was ) attacks , thereby prompting Speedy Gonzales to spring into action . And he does . . . with a vengeance ! The great part is knowing what's going to happen , and watching it play out . I noticed that the vulture / crow had a face very similar to Daffy Duck . Maybe this was a preview of the Speedy / Daffy cartoons in the mid to late ' 60s . Or maybe it's just a coincidence . Overall , " Tortilla Flaps " is a really fun cartoon . They must have had a lot of fun filming it . I guess that lots of things can hurt people's pride . PS : I know that " exito " was just supposed to be " exit " with O on the end , but that word actually is Spanish for " success " .
gorilla my dreams	Even if you have no idea who Dian Fossey was , " Gorillas in the Mist : The Story of Dian Fossey " is still amazing . Sigourney Weaver perfectly captures the spirit of the woman who sought to save Africa's mountain gorillas from extermination by human encroachment . It was eye-opening to see her go from an all-American babe ( needing her bras in the jungle ) to a politicized woman living with the gorillas . The end brings up a question : just who was it ? Even if we never find out who specifically did it , it just goes to show that various factions wanted her out of the way . All in all , this is a great movie , one that I recommend to everyone . Once again , Michael Apted ( of the " 7 Up " series " and the never - released - on - video - or - DVD " Stardust " ) shows himself to be a great director . Also starring Bryan Brown .
mine hero	Yet again , Wile E . Coyote ( insert scientific name involving eating ) sets a series of traps to get Road Runner ( insert scientific name involving speed ) , but always gets himself . Probably the coolest one here is a tornado seed . Sure enough , he gets sucked in . . . and then there's a mine field ! And the guy still doesn't give up ! True , even before " Whoa , Be-Gone ! " starts , you know what sorts of things are going to happen , but it's still a hoot . After all , WEC always gets his just desserts for trying to harm RR ( another one of the tricks involves a trampoline ) . It's truly a classic . Available on Volume 2 Disc 2 of the Looney Tunes DVDs .
two weeks ago , I'd never even heard of a coxswain	Throughout the past forty years , much has been written about the Vietnam War . Less has been told about the history of Vietnam before the US got involved . Regis Wargnier's " Indochine " does a really good job . Catherine Deneuve plays Eliane Devries , the owner of a rubber plantation in 1930s Vietnam . Eliane has raised a Vietnamese girl ( Lin Dam Pham ) as her own and named her Camille . But then , two things change the course of the mother-daughter relationship . One is that Camille falls for French soldier Jean-Baptiste ( Vincent Perez ) . The other is Vietnam's budding independence movement , with which Camille gets involved . Jean-Baptiste's relationship with Camille makes him suspect in the eyes of the colonial government . At the very least , this movie is a fine focus on the events that led up to the US's tragic involvement in Indochina . But it's also a good look at Vietnamese culture ( I like it when movies show us a culture that we don't usually get to see ) , not to mention the Vietnamese landscape . To be certain , I have always considered it important to understand as much as possible about regions such as Indochina , if only to understand why the US got involved there . Definitely a great one . I recommend it . And yes , two weeks ago , I'd never heard of a coxswain ( which they mention during the boat racing scene ) . I only first learned the word while watching the Beijing Olympics .
My favorite Christmas movie of all time .	Usually , when we think of Christmas movies , we think of flicks like " It's a Wonderful Life " . Well , here's a new kind : " Gremlins " . This has got to be one of the coolest movies ever made . Joe Dante - always a director with some neat ideas - couldn't have pulled it off better . It all begins when inventor Rand Peltzer ( Hoyt Axton ) buys a furry little creature called " mogwai " from a Chinese salesman ( Keye Luke ) . There are three rules about mogwai : 1 ) Never expose him to bright light ( the sun could kill him ) . 2 ) Never expose him to water ( certainly don't give him a bath ) . 3 ) The most important rule of all is never , ever , EVER , under any circumstances , feed him after midnight . So , Rand gives mogwai to his son Billy ( Zach Galligan ) . But , as you might have guessed , the rules get broken , and before long , the little town of Kingston Falls is overrun by mean , green gremlins . Everything that you love about movies , you're likely to find in " Gremlins " . Whether it's the inside jokes ( a cinema is showing " A Boy's Life " and " Watch the Skies " , the working titles for " E . T . " and " Close Encounters of the Third Kind " , respectively ) , the indictment of vicious landlady Ruby Deagle ( Polly Holliday ) , Lynn Peltzer's ( Frances Lee McCain ) battles with the gremlins , or the overall jab at a " wholesome American small town " , this is a top-notch thriller / comedy . I'm sure that Phoebe Cates is proud to have gotten an early role in this ( she plays Billy's girlfriend Kate Beringer ) . And since this is a Joe Dante movie , B-movie actor Dick Miller of course gets a role : he plays sour neighbor Murray Futterman . Maybe this is just me , but I've noticed some similarities between " Gremlins " and " Ghostbusters " . The obvious one is that they're both about things that nobody wants around town , but there's more . They're both plural nouns beginning with " G " . " Gremlins " has 8 letters , " Ghostbusters " has 12 ; 8 and 12 are both divisible by 4 . Both movies were released on 8 June 1984 ( a year ending with 4 , a day divisible by 4 ) . Oh well , maybe I'm the only one who would even notice that . The point is that this is one great movie , and everyone should see it . .
7 deadly - but hilarious - spins	" Thank You for Smoking " does what few movies ever know how to do : it hits us all right where it hurts , pointing out everyone's hypocrisy in everything , and the way that our society is based on spin . Aaron Eckhart , whom you may remember from " Erin Brockovich " , gets the role of a lifetime as tobacco industry spin doctor Nick Naylor , whose job it is to make his industry look good and win people over . With his good boy looks and worldly charm , he has no problem doing just that . The opening scene features Nick on a talk show with a cancer patient and representatives from anti-smoking groups . He manages to frame the debate so that it looks like the tobacco industry wants to keep the patient alive . That sets up how manipulative this guy is . For meals , he likes to meet with the MOD Squad ( meaning " merchants of death " ) to discuss how to market . This group consists of Polly ( Maria Bello ) from the alcohol industry and Bobby Jay ( David Koechner ) of the firearm industry . Nick always reminds Polly and Bobby Jay that he , Nick , has it the hardest ; their products kill far fewer people . As for Nick's personal life , he always reminds his son Joey ( Cameron Bright ) to think for himself - which of course means always question people who say that cigarettes are bad . In fact , he even shows Joey how to present an argument for a class paper , and no one in the class can challenge the argument . That's how good this guy is at PR . But as Nick notes while getting interviewed by reporter Heather Holloway ( Katie Holmes ) : " I do it for the mortgage . " That's when the movie really gets good . Nick's boss BR ( J . K . Simmons , who played Spiderman's boss ) , sends Nick to meet with the Captain ( Robert Duvall ) , sort of the head honcho of the tobacco industry in Winston-Salem . The Captain explains to Nick that to market cigarettes , they need to make cigarettes look sexy . So , Nick meets with the ultimate entertainment executive , EGO CEO Jeff Megall ( Rob Lowe ) . They figure that Brad Pitt and Catherine Zeta-Jones lighting up after having sex in outer space would make a great scene . . . especially if they release a tie-in cigarette . And when Nick meets with the dying Marlboro Man ( Sam Elliott ) . . . well , let's just say that I didn't expect that scene ! However , Nick's life might get a lot more complicated . Self-righteous Vermont Sen . Ortolan Finistirre ( William H . Macy ) wants to put a warning label on cigarettes , and subpoenas Nick about the dangers of his products . But Nick knows just how to get the public on his own side at the hearing ( " Isn't heart disease a problem , but your state keeps making cheddar cheese ? " ) . All in all , " Thank You for Smoking " is a great look at everything . It's not a polemic at all . Quite simply , it's about how our society is dominated by spin , political diatribes , etc , and both sides are hypocrites , always doing everything possible to make themselves look good . The movie stings like a bee . Perfect .
Alan Bates ' best movie ever	Hopefully , by now we've all figured out that war is not only hell , it's insanity . " The King of Hearts " does a great job showing that . In WWI , the residents of a French village have fled , leaving the village empty . Now , both the English and German armies are looking to take over . So , the British general sends Pvt . Charles Plumpick ( Alan Bates ) into town to investigate , and Plumpick finds that the people from the insane asylum have taken over . They don't even know that the war has been going on ! But the final scene shows definitively that the " insane " people are not as insane as the people commanding the war . Everyone in the movie just does a great job . Alan Bates is in top-notch form , as always , and we do have to ask ourselves : Is the real insanity inside or outside the asylum ?
if solely a problem such as alcoholism can help a person find redemption , then so be it	Mike Figgis's " Leaving Las Vegas " , while it pounds you in the face , also creates a sense of hope . Nicolas Cage plays Ben Sanderson , a man nearly at the end of his emotional rope who has come to Las Vegas to drink himself to death . In Las Vegas , he hooks up with prostitute Sera ( Elisabeth Shue ) , who acts as a sort of last catharsis for him . Figgis knows how to hit the audience from the first shot : the opening scene shows Ben pushing a shopping cart down an aisle , placing liquor bottles into the cart while dancing . In other words , while he's clearly a pathetic soul , he apparently has some drive left in himself , even if it exists only as his personal escapism . Moreover , one thing that the movie makes sure to do is not portray the characters as one-dimensional : Ben is an honest man at heart but his drunkenness turns him into a nasty person , while Sera has her own demons to deal with . It also doesn't make the mistake of focusing on Las Vegas to the point of glamorizing it ; the city remains the story's setting above all else . Nicolas Cage certainly deserved his Oscar for his role here , bringing out Ben's many qualities to their fullest . Shue is equally great in her role , showing Sera as someone whom we need to understand , even if we don't admire her . Also starring - and doing a very good job - are Julian Sands , Richard Lewis , Steven Weber and Carey Lowell . All in all , I wholeheartedly recommend this movie .
diaries always make for something great	Telling the story of the German-Jewish girl whose diary brought memories of the Third Reich into people's homes worldwide , " The Diary of Anne Frank " haunts you like few other movies . As the titular character , Millie Perkins creates someone who - despite her horrific experiences - remains convinced that human nature is good . Probably the two most harrowing scenes in the movie are when everyone listens to Hitler on the radio , and when Anne faints while someone walks up the stairs . All in all , this is a great movie . Equally as good as Perkins are Joseph Schildkraut as Anne's father Otto , who will stop at nothing to protect his family ; Shelley Winters ( who won Best Supporting Actress ) as Petronella Van Daan , the matriarch of the family hiding with them ; and Richard Beymer - who played Tony in " West Side Story " - as Peter Van Daan , with whom Anne develops a relationship . Also starring are Gusti Huber , Lou Jacobi , Diane Baker , Douglas Spencer , Dodie Heath and Ed Wynn . A masterpiece .
attack of the killer pine-cone	In some ways , it seems that if you've seen one ' 50s B sci-fi movie , you've seen ' em all . But " The Hideous Sun Demon " elicits a certain charm , showing how the guy's condition affects him emotionally . Specifically , a scientist ( Robert Clarke , who also directed ) gets exposed to atomic isotopes and develops a condition that turns him into something resembling a giant pine-cone whenever he gets exposed to the sun's rays . I should say that the acting is pretty bad , and I wonder how accurate their scientific references were . But these movies are always a pleasure to watch , partly because they're full of really hot babes ( you'll see what I mean by that scene on the beach ) . Worth seeing maybe once . . . or more if you like to get horny . PS : that road next to the beach is the Pacific Coast Highway , also featured in " It's a Mad , Mad , Mad , Mad World " .
the good ol ' Irish	Similar to " The Full Monty " ( but never copying it ) , " Waking Ned Devine " tells the story of a village in Ireland suddenly upset by some quirky events . When local old timer Ned Devine dies , his friends discover that he has won the lottery , and set about trying to reclaim the cash . I remember that I saw this movie a few months before Ian Bannen died , so I pretty much will always remember him for his great role here as Jackie O'Shea ( although I do also remember him from " Ghost Dad " ) . David Kelly is equally great as Michael O'Sullivan , collaborating with Jackie to collect the cash . And let me tell you , I didn't see that motorcycle scene coming ! Overall , " Waking Ned Devine " is one of those great little movies about life in general . As I am not Catholic , prior to seeing this movie , I thought " wake " only meant " get someone up from sleeping " ! But either way , it's a great movie . I will forever remember David Kelly as both Michael O'Sullivan from this movie and as Grandpa Joe in " Charlie and the Chocolate Factory " .
It's Tracy / Hepburn , so you know that it's good .	Pat Pemberton ( Katharine Hepburn ) is a sports star , except when in the presence of her fiancé . That's when she joins up with promoter Mike Conovan ( Spencer Tracy ) , and things get good . I think that my favorite scene in " Pat and Mike " is when some thugs are harassing Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn clobbers them ; that scene really hits ya in the good spots ( of course , it also shows why Katharine Hepburn was so unique ; how many other actresses back then would kick ass like that ? ) . All in all , you're sure to admire this movie , but how can you not admire a Tracy / Hepburn movie ? It's a treat in every way . Watch for Jim Backus and Charles Bronson in early roles .
one of Eddie Murphy's two good movies that year	In a totally mind-blowing , Hollywood-jabbing story , Steve Martin plays director Bobby Bowfinger , who wants to hire top star Kit Ramsey ( Eddie Murphy ) for a role in the sci-fi movie " Chubby Rain " , about aliens arriving on earth by hiding in raindrops . When Ramsey refuses , Bowfinger decides to secretly film Ramsey , leading to some rather whacked-out situations . It only complicates matters when Ramsey goes to a Scientology-spoofing organization for a rest , and they have to hire a replacement . I don't know whether or not this is the sort of role that only Steve Martin could do , but he does a great job with it , as we would expect . Some of the scenes where they film Eddie Murphy are a hoot , especially in the parking structure . It was sort of jarring to see Robert Downey Jr , as this was released around the time when he kept getting in trouble with the law . Also starring Heather Graham , Christine Baranski , Jamie Kennedy , and Terence Stamp .
I was rooting for this for Best Picture .	In what may be Robert Altman's best movie since " McCabe and Mrs . Miller " , a plethora of aristocrats and their servants come to an estate in rural England in 1932 for a hunting party . When a murder takes place , it sets the stage for discovering that there's more to these people than anyone realizes . Obviously , that's a loose description , but I don't want to give away too much . But I will note this scene : when Insp . Thompson ( Stephen Fry ) is investigating , he says " Only the people with secrets should be worried . " He doesn't know just how serious he is ! This has the definite feel of an Altman movie , namely the overlapping dialogue . I literally have nothing bad to say about " Gosford Park " ; everything about it was done perfectly . Bob Balaban , Alan Bates , Michael Gambon , Helen Mirren , Jeremy Northam , Ryan Philippe , Maggie Smith , Kristin Scott Thomas , and everyone else all do a marvellous job with their roles . Moreover , this movie's prominence when it came out gave Altman a chance to take a swipe at George W . Bush . Julian Fellowes took home an Oscar for his screenplay ( I was rooting for this movie for Best Picture ) . And now that the Academy is giving Altman an honorary Oscar at the upcoming ceremony , I think that it affirms everything that I've just said here . When Ryan Philippe starred in " I Know What You Did Last Summer " , who ever would have guessed that he would co-star with Miss Jean Brodie a few years later ?
From the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli . . .	" Bugs and Daffy : Wartime Cartoons " has renowned film critic Leonard Maltin presenting several WWII-themed Looney Tunes cartoons . I had known that Warner Bros . released some cartoons portraying Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck making mincemeat out of Nazis , but I didn't about the ones portraying life back in the states . I guess that what I really liked in this documentary was that it consisted mostly of the cartoons and not excessive descriptions of them ; after all , we watch these things so as to see the cartoons . If anything surprised me , it was that the Termite Terrace crowd didn't have Elmer Fudd go up against Hitler . But anyway , it's a pretty neat documentary . I guess that " Russian Rhapsody " must have been the only cartoon that unequivocally made the Russians look like the good guys .
Listen you stuffy screwheads . . . their names are Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell and this movie is their boomstick !	The third time really is the charm , and " Army of Darkness " proves it incontrovertibly . This time , they just let the movie be what the first two movies were at heart : nice , silly , goofy , wacko , nonsensical fun . Just imagine the Three Stooges starring in a horror flick and you've got " Army of Darkness " . The whole movie basically consists of Ash ( Bruce Campbell ) going after various evil spirits in the funniest way possible . And the quotes are some of the most hilarious quotes that you could ever imagine , probably mostly owing to how Bruce Campbell says them . Literally every scene is pure hilarity . Whether it's Ash showing his " boomstick " , having trouble retrieving the book , battling mini-Ashes , or the big battle at the end , you never stop laughing yourself hoarse ( I particularly liked some of the bone-related quotes ) . It doesn't even suffice to give this movie stars . It deserves 100 . . . no , a million . . . no , . Yeah , . Bruce Campbell not only deserves a star on the Walk of Fame , there needs to be a statue of him . Oh , and an extra note . When I went to see " Bubba Ho-Tep " in the theater , Bruce Campbell was supposed to be there , but had to cancel . So , there was a short clip at the beginning showing him thanking us for coming , when his phone rang : " Hello . . . Oh , hi Sam . Listen , I'll get to you in a minute . " ( turns to audience ) " So thanks for coming to this movie . " ( retrieves his phone ) " Yeah , Sam ? . . . " Evil Dead 4 " ? ! I'll do it ! " I just wonder how they would continue the story , now that Ash battled skeletons with his " boomstick " .
like nothing that you've ever seen before	" Memento " is one of those movies that I fear discussing because I don't know how much I can tell without giving the whole thing away . You might have heard that the story gets told in reverse and that Guy Pearce plays Leonard Shelby , who has a memory problem . People are able to abuse him and all sorts of other horrible things . Then , he has to use the little bit of memory that he has left to . . . no , I can't tell you ; it would give the whole movie away . My point is that " Memento " is a most incredible movie . You quite literally have to see it to believe it . You might even want to watch it more than once , possibly backwards . Or something similar .
Wait ' til you see what you can learn by watching it with subtitles !	I must admit that I'd never heard of " Starsky & Hutch " until the movie came out . But what a movie ! Featuring frequent co-stars Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson as the eponymous , ultra-cool cops in 1970s LA , the movie is one crazy thing after another . Snoop Dogg as hoodlum-turned-informant Huggy Bear is a hoot , Vince Vaughn as villain Reese Feldman is great , and the whole movie just makes you long for the ' 70s . But in my opinion , the best part of the movie is watching it with Spanish subtitles ( as I often do when watching a movie on DVD ) . They've got some impressive translations there . As it was , even though my mom didn't watch the movie itself , she could hear it , and asked me the next morning about the Carpenters ' song in it ( which I didn't recognize ) ; I assume that it was the song played at the bat mitzvah ( although what ends up happening in that scene sort of overshadows everything else ) . All in all , a hilarious movie . Also starring Fred Williamson , Juliette Lewis , Chris Penn , and Will Ferrell .
How did we ever get by without these movies ( especially when they starred Barbara Steele ) ?	In one of the many Italian horror flicks from the early-to-mid 1960s , lawyer Albert Kovac ( Walter Brandi ) goes to a country estate where it turns out that the owner has been dead for a year . This family buried plague victims hundreds of years earlier . But the owner might have never totally left , and his widow Cleo ( Barbara Steele ) is the most eye-opening of people . Oh , I can't accurately describe " 5 tombe per un medium " ( called " Terror-Creatures from the Grave " in the US ) . You gotta see it . A previous reviewer accurately called it top-notch Eurohorror . Some scenes really give you a " gotcha " feeling . And above all , Barbara Steele is HOT HOT HOT ! You're sure to like this movie . pure water . . . pure water
40 ways to play football	Nick Nolte gets the role of a lifetime as the receiver in a Dallas football team whose value to the team may be wearing out . The movie is overall a pretty scathing look at pro sports , showing in one scene how they give a player a shot so that he can keep playing even while injured . But of course , this is Texas , so football is king . Nolte does very well in his role . Also starring are Mac Davis as the quarterback , and Charles Durning as the coach ( " If you moved any slower , you'd be going backwards ! " ) . One can just imagine if " North Dallas Forty " was set in the 21st century , how George W . Bush would probably own the team and everything would thus be connected to the oil industry - although it might have been even back then . Anyway , this is a very good sports movie , even better than " All the Right Moves " . You may not want to play any organized sport after watching this . Also starring Steve Forrest , G . D . Spradlin ( the senator in " The Godfather Part II " ) and Dabney Coleman .
Germany having to come to grips with it's past .	Rainer Werner Fassbinder may have been post-war Germany's greatest director , and " Fear Eats the Soul " is one of the many movies that shows it . Emmi Kurowski ( Brigitte Mira ) is a middle-aged woman who falls for young Arab immigrant Ali ( El Hedi ben Salem ) , to the dismay of her friends and relatives . Emmi and Ali try to live their lives normally , while doing everything possible to fight off verbal attacks . I guess that in Germany they felt sort of an obligation to make these kinds of movies , given their past . Of course , virtually every Western power ( including the United States ) has had such a past . But either way , " Fear Eats the Soul " is a truly great movie .
Everything's new in this movie !	" What's New , Pussycat ? " is a comedy flick very typical of the mid ' 60s : totally madcap to the point where you feel like the world has been turned inside out . Focusing on a womanizer ( Peter O'Toole ) trying to get help from an even more lecherous psychiatrist ( Peter Sellers ) , they just go all out and pull every trick that they can . Obviously , one of the really eye-opening things is the presence of Woody Allen in his debut ; and he's as neurotic as he is in his other movies . Ah , and then there's the chase at the end ( it seems like every 1960s comedy had a chase of some sort ) . You won't want it to end , even though it soon does . But anyway , this movie has something for everyone . Also starring Capucine , Paula Prentiss and Ursula Andress ( as hot as ever ) . PS : the theme song was also used in the opening credits in " The Life and Death of Peter Sellers " .
Fellini always had something to offer	Most of Federico Fellini's movies were deliberately bizarre , but " Amarcord " is toned down slightly . That doesn't mean that it's not good . On the contrary , it's another masterpiece . In this case , he focuses on a small town in 1930s Italy , as seen from the eyes of a teenage boy . It's a world of Mussolini's fascism , and a movie theater full of many classic movies . A particularly interesting scene has them burning " the witch " , and there's a little bit of a mishap ( or maybe it wasn't a mishap ) . Anyway , " Amarcord " is another great movie from the man who may have been Italy's greatest director in history . A true classic .
this train is no mystery	John Frankenheimer directed Burt Lancaster in a troika of really good movies : " The Birdman of Alcatraz " , " The Train " and " Seven Days in May " . " The Train " tells the story of some French Resistance fighters trying to stop the Nazis from seizing the country's great art collection by stopping their train . Lancaster has the role of a lifetime as Paul Labiche , leading the Resistance . Paul Scofield also does a great job as Col . Von Waldheim , as vile as anyone would expect a Nazi Kommandant to be . Some of the scenes that they filmed are more than impressive . This may be THE movie that shows why John Frankenheimer epitomized the cinematic new wave in the ' 60s , along with Norman Jewison and Mike Nichols .
Wile E . Coyote meets Rube Goldberg	No matter how many times Wile Ethelbert " Famishius Famishius " Coyote tries to get Road " Burnius Roadibus " Runner , we always know what's going to happen , though our sympathy always remains with WEC . The highlight in " Hook , Line and Stinker " is a Rube Goldberg-style scheme that WEC hopes will finally finish off RR ; but of course you know what happens . So , Wile E . continues hilarious engaging in fanaticism ( defined by George Santayana as redoubling your effort after you've forgotten your aim ) while Road Runner pretty much never becomes aware of the potential danger - or lack thereof - in which he could find himself . A real classic . And yes , the coyote's middle name is Ethelbert . I learned that from " Jeopardy ! " .
It actually did stay pretty faithful to the book . And it shows that Tom Cruise was better before he got into cool guy roles .	People often debate which was Francis Ford Coppola's best movie ever : one of the " Godfather " movies or " Apocalypse Now " . While I would argue for the latter , I would also like to say that " The Outsiders " should be # 2 . This movie is so great that I can't describe it . Told from the perspective of Ponyboy Curtis ( C . Thomas Howell ) , it's the story of several destitute teenage boys and young men in 1966 Oklahoma , and their struggle to belong in the world . The movie ranges from sad - when Johnny Cade ( Ralph Macchio ) dies from burns sustained in a church fire - to funny - when Keith " Two-Bit " Mathews ( Emilio Estevez ) drinks beer for breakfast while watching cartoons . With great support from Matt Dillon , Patrick Swayze , Tom Cruise and Diane Lane , this is one movie that you just have to see .
Even though I didn't see the whole thing . . .	. . . what I saw was funny enough . Featuring a tan-less George Hamilton as Count Vladimir Dracula looking for a bride in 1970s New York , the movie is basically an excuse to be silly . His bride to be in this case is Cindy Sondheim ( Susan St . James ) , and Richard Benjamin is his usual funny self as Dr . Jeffrey Rosenberg trying to protect Cindy from the count . My favorite scene was when Jeffrey holds up the " cross " . Dick Shawn - in a role fairly reminiscent of " It's a Mad , Mad , Mad , Mad World " and " The Producers " - plays an uptight cop , and Arte Johnson plays Renfield . All that I can say is that you'll definitely want to sink your teeth into this movie .
Let's go sailing !	People who say that some of what the Looney Tunes cartoons show is inappropriate for children have apparently forgotten something : they weren't originally intended for children . They were produced for the cinema , to be shown before feature films , and so they could show anything that they wanted . " Tweety's S . O . S . " has that bad puddy tat Sylvester finding Tweety aboard an ocean liner and boarding the ship to try and get him . But two things work against Sylvester : Granny is vehemently protecting the canary , and Sylvester easily gets seasick ( we don't see him throwing up , but with his green face , they make it perfectly clear that he was doing just that ! ) . And then of course , the seemingly cute Tweety has a bad-ass streak . It's just great to see how these cartoons weren't afraid to go all out ; whatever they thought about showing , they showed . We need to understand that cartoons weren't always supposed to be cute entertainment for children . Really funny .
The 3rd time IS the charm !	After " Temple of Doom " went off in another direction , Steven Spielberg got the trilogy back on track with " Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade " . The plot of course has the eponymous archaeologist ( Harrison Ford ) and his father Henry ( Sean Connery ) battling Nazis while searching for the Holy Grail . The hot babe this time is Dr . Elsa Schneider ( Alison Doody ) , while Denholm Elliott and John Rhys-Davies return as Marcus Brody and Sallah , respectively . My favorite scene ? Hard to say ; this movie had so many cool scenes . OK , so the Indiana Jones movies were basically escapism , but well-done escapism . You won't be disappointed after seeing this movie .
Remember not to call him Shirley !	By now , everyone must know about " Airplane ! " . A spoof of the disaster movies of the 1970s replete with every gag imaginable . Whether it's the announcers arguing over the red zones and white zones , the obnoxious solicitors , the jumping artificial heart , the oddly named crew , the automatic pilot , or the various media sources around the world , the goofiness just keeps on coming . The relationship between Ted Striker ( Robert Hays ) and Elaine Dickinson ( Julie Hagerty ) basically takes a back seat to the outlandish one-liners ( " We have to get this woman to a hospital . " " A hospital ? What is it ? " " It's a big building with patients , but that's not important now . " ) If you ask me , humor doesn't have to reflect the real world ; a bunch of wacko gags works just fine . And that's just what " Airplane ! " is . I guess that you could say that Leslie Nielsen ( himself a veteran of " The Poseidon Adventure " , a typical disaster flick ) was getting honed for the " Naked Gun " movies .
better than anyone might expect	Bill Murray really does his best when playing outright wacky characters like the one in " What About Bob ? " . In this case , he's a mentally unstable psychiatric patient who follows his psychiatrist ( Richard Dreyfuss ) on vacation and practically takes over . In a way , the whole movie's sort of silly , but it shows how the psychiatrist is basically a pompous dweeb and Bob is the world's most lovable person , if not quite all there . It's really neat towards the end , how the psychiatrist starts losing his mind in frustration . All in all , it shows that Frank Oz is quite capable as a director , and that Murray and Dreyfuss are two of the greatest actors of our era . Also starring Julie Hagerty , Charlie Korsmo and Roger Bowen in his final role .
They did it . . . they really did it !	One has to wonder how they came up with the idea for this movie , but that could distract from the movie itself . " Being John Malkovich " is so hilarious in every way , that I can't even describe it . You have to see it to believe it . As one of the many movies ( along with " The Blair Witch Project " , " The Sixth Sense " and " American Beauty " ) which affirmed that 1999 was to my generation what 1967 was to my parents generation ( thanks to " Bonnie and Clyde " , " In the Heat of the Night " and " The Graduate ) , this is one movie that you can't afford to miss . It may have very well been the coolest movie of 1999 , and it certainly affirmed John Malkovich as one of the great actors of our time .
as this movie proves , the ' 70s will NEVER die	One of the great things about movies that look at times past is the way they poke fun at individuals who didn't get into popular culture . In this case , four friends in 1970s Michigan worship KISS , but one's mother is a fundamentalist Christian who believes that KISS stands for " Knights In Satan's Service " . In a way , " Detroit Rock City " is sort of an excuse to be crazy . Whether it's the scene where the four friends hide out in the girls ' bathroom and listen to the girl in the neighboring stall , or the part where they finally arrive at KISS's concert , this movie has something for everyone . Everyone who loves the ' 70s , that is .
