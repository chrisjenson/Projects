Pathetic , utterly .	It would take a ton and a half of psychedelic mushrooms to get past this thing . I frankly admire - - no , I mean it ! - - anyone who can get through it . It takes will power and self discipline of an almost supernal quality . Boy , does this stink . By this time in his life poor Lon Chaney was a hopeless lush . Mantan Moreland , an icon of 40s cinema , has about five minutes before he's turned into mincemeat . The rest of the cast are , let's say , best forgotten . Except maybe for the teenager who plays Virginia , the worst of the Merry Cuisineart family , who has a certain je ne sais quois . Look . I wouldn't even be reviewing this except that my brother , a viewer whose tastes run even below my own , had recorded it and we were both looking forward to seeing a movie so bad that it was enjoyable . He switched it off . Q . E . D . Meaning quod erat demonstrandum , that which was to be demonstrated . It was too low even for his taste . Boy , is it sad .
Avoid it	Every human being faces eventual dissolution . Our most monumental curse is that we know it in a way , that say , a dog does not . The funerary practices of our own civilization can be seen as attempts to build a cocoon around the dead to shield them from the living . Even when we get to see the corpses they are coyly painted , drained , and stuffed . They bear as much resemblance to the living person we knew as one of those " serving suggestions " on the carton of a prepared dinner bears to the actual contents . The corpse lies there , quietly , soberly , as if deep in thought . It does not sweat . It does not have dandruff or bad breath . And maybe that's the way we should remember the living . Some commentors have found the scenes near the beginning of this film , in which the dead and buried , claw their rotting way out of the ground , to be haunting and beautiful . I can't imagine why . This Romero clone is even more loathesome than the originals . Zombies stagger about , banging on doors , falling to pieces , contaminating spaces with foul odors , offending the sight . The supposedly amusing lines - - " It HURTS to be dead ! " , " This isn't just a punk outfit , it's a way of life ! " , and the German-accented embalmer listening to Wagner while he plies his trade - - are not in fact amusing . You know who would find movies like this enjoyable ? Those with perhaps the bodies and certainly the minds of twelve-year-olds . It's difficult to imagine an audience of mature people who have had any contact with dead bodies before they were prettied up finding anything to hoot and clap about . Films about ghosts can be funny if embroidered with anything like elegant wit . Films about rotting corpses doing their best to devour the living are kind of depressing , despite the wisecracks . The final gag is the best . The military , not knowing how to deal with this irruption of zombies in the small town , drop an atomic bomb and destroy the entire community . There's a real knee slapper for you .
Higher authority . . .	This movie is a longie and I must confess I nodded out from time to time . The fact that it is also surprisingly boring didn't help much . I watched it chiefly because I was curious to see what sort of spin it would put on Ollie North's political shenanigans . I really didn't expect a Jimmy-Stewart-type hero to emerge from a book written by somebody named Ben Bradlee , Jr . and I was right on that count . At the same time , I figured , movie makers being the capitalists they are , the story would be dumbed down in order to appeal to the lowest common intellectual and moral denominator . After all , there were plenty of pick up trucks driving around at the time bearing bumper stickers that said , " Oliver North for President , " and the drivers were serious . That's about how it turned out . North was actually someone who loved his country not wisely but too well . ( I'll never forget Fawn Hall of the bouffant do , being asked why she and Ollie subverted the Constitution of the United States , replying , " Sometimes you have to answer to a higher authority . " I suspect she picked up that phrase from a Hebrew National Frankfurter commercial on TV . ) We're given an Ollie who is much more rigid , authoritarian , and distant than the cracked-voiced heroic figure we were presented with on TV screens . I don't know how accurately the infield plays are portrayed , not having bothered to follow the actual events that closely . I suppose that how much this particular Ollie North appeals to you depends on the intensity of your chauvinism . North and the rest are people for whom the words " America " and " democracy " are synonymous . They are willing to sacrifice anything , including their careers , their families , and their lives if necessary , in the cause of freedom , except that like Humpty Dumpty they are at liberty to define freedom however they want while ignoring anybody else's definition . It's disturbingly like what some political figures are doing today in drawing up definitions of causus bellum . The movie itself ? David Keith doesn't have the marquee power of the original . The guy tries hard but manages to do not much more than alternate between a shouting hatred of weakness and communism and a fawning beaming obsequious ambition like Uriah Heep . Annette O'Toole with her pursed plummy lips should have had more screen time . Bernard Hughes , grown older and plumper , is quite good . The portrayal of Ronald Reagan is best of all and should have been seen on Saturday Night Live . Iran / Contra . The name is so " past " somehow , so far away . It seems almost unbelievable . Especially now , since we can order the war drums to start beating at our whim , alienate half our own population and ALL of the rest of the world , and prepare to launch an invasion of a country because of what we think that they may do sometime . And now , thank God , we can do it all out in the open - - and screw all that secrecy stuff .
Utter schlock , even by slasher standards .	It's a murder mystery cum slasher movie built around the goings-on at a Catholic church . The little girls are lined up backstage for their appearance at their first holy communion . Brooke Shields , the last in line , is strangled and her body stuffed into a window seat and set afire . That's the good part . The audience gets to see the killer too , but he or she is all dressed up in an oil slicker like the Gloucester Fisherman and wears a halloween mask of a smiling young girl . Suspicion is immediately cast on another young girl , Alice , and for good reason . She showed up late for the service , is seen coveting and hiding a veil that may have belonged to Shields , and owns an oil slicker , a mask , and a butcher knife . Also , boy , is she a waspy thing , insulting , shrieking angrily at everyone , especially her critical aunt , ridiculing a tenant in her apartment house who is morbidly obese . This obese guy is great . He can't act but he looks perfect , with his shaved head and goatee . He listens to scratchy opera records and mopey old torch songs , keeps a room full of kittens , and doesn't clean up his apartment . I suppose the opera and his effeminate tone are designed to suggest his sexual orientation , but then he puts moves on the eleven-year-old Alice , which simply confuses things . I guess he's polymorphously perverse . But , if the truth be told , you hardly notice the confusion because in fact the marginal utility of his sexual orientation is so low . The confusion is already so bountiful that , following Weber's law of just-noticeable-differences , the guy's homosexuality makes hardly a dent . During some of the killings , the violins shriek exactly like those in Hitchcock's superb " Psycho . " I won't go on too much longer . The murders multiply . Father Tom , at the church , is the only guy we can possibly identify with . He looks the part and sounds reasonable . There's blood all over the place after the initial strangling . Alice's aunt goes , Alice's estranged father goes ( I think ) , the fat guy goes , Father Tom goes - - all bathed in blood . I was sorry to see Brooke Shields get it so early , and in her first movie too . But I didn't believe she was eleven years old . I believe she's never been eleven years old , but that she's always been a middle-aged midget , parading her cuteness around like Shirley Temple did before her . Wild horses couldn't drag the identity of the murderer from me , but I will say that the reveal comes as a shock . It's rather like Thelma Ritter turning out to be the murderer in " Rear Window . " And there's just as much motivation , which is to say none at all . To cap it off , after the murderer is apprehended during mass , Sweet Alice leaves the church , stunned , and on the way she opens a bag she's been carrying and therein lies - - a butcher knife , which she partly withdraws in the most sinister fashion . What this is supposed to signify is , well , there are some things man was never meant to know , and this is one of them . As a minor carp , I didn't particularly like the way that Catholic liturgy is put on display as if this were all a freak show . The mass is in Latin ( gosh ! ) , the communicants are seen from Father Tom's point of view with their tongues hanging out , and there are other grotesqueries , such as religious icons made to look like the garish and spooky figures in Madame Tussaud's . What a meretricious kettle of fish .
That's it ! Engorge the feijoada !	The first time Carrie Otis appears on screen , she is a newly minted international lawyer at a job interview . She's breathless , anxious , and sounds fake . I thought she was doing the character , but in reality that was it . That's all she has for the entire movie . And Mickey Rourke ? Did someone whisper to him that he was the sexiest man alive , or what ? He does his best with Feminine Fantasy Number One , the mysterious , masculine , empathic self-made man who is filthy rich , but he simply can't pull it off without a French accent . Jacqueline Bisset's character should carry a sign around her neck - - " Bitch . " There's not much point in going on about the plot , something out of a shoebox , which provides at least some material for a travelogue , though there have been better attempts to capture Rio ( " Black Orpheus , " eg . ) . The story gives Rourke a hang up . He can't stand to be touched - - let alone the other thing . But , no fear , Otis overcomes his inhibitions by the power of her pulchritude so we can end with a nearly explicit coupling . He turns out to be robustly masculine after all . Is that what " wild orchid " means ? I mean , is it some kind of terribly mangled PUN ? Here are some examples of the dialog . " Sometimes we all have to lose ourselves a little in order to find ourselves . " And Otis : " I'm sorry , " to which Rourke replies , " It's not you - - it's me . " A sex scene dissolves into shots of the morning surf rolling in . Otis does in fact have one thing going for her , a slight lisp , in addition to her strong and attractive face and her robust figure . Rourke , though some sort of cryptohypnotism , has talked a bickering German couple into coupling in the back of a stretch limo while he and Otis watch . " Tell me what you see ? " Rourke asks her . " I thee two people having thexth . " There isn't anything much except thexth behind this excuse to cash in on the profits of Rourke's previous soft-core movie with Kim Basinger , and maybe take along some of the nut from " Emanuelle , " another story about a rich man introducing a sexy but deprived young woman into the glories of debauchery . It's fun watching someone penetrate the mystique , but as the sociologist Erving Goffman once observed , often the real secret behind the mystery is that there is no secret at all . Maybe that's why masks are so commonly seen in this film . But this is a feminine fantasy , co-written by a woman , and so instead of bikini-clad young blond girl leaping in slow motion to bat the volleyball , we have Speedo-clad young men leaping in slow motion to bat the volleyball . I prefer the girls but both images are pretty banal .
Low-level thrills .	A bickering couple ( Luke Wilson , Kate Beckinsale ) are forced to register at an isolated motel when their car breaks down . They shortly discover a pile of VHS tapes in their room . They play the tapes and find that they are snuff films ( for want of a better word ) that were shot by secreted cameras in the very room they now occupy . The motel manager with the creepy , over-sized eyes is running some kind of private show . His two or three goons wear generic horror-movie masks . The goons begin trying to force their way into the motel room . The husband tries to hold the unlocked door half shut while the maniac on the other side has thrust his arm through , waving a butcher knife around wildly . The wife shrieks and hides . The husband is knifed in the gut defending her and collapses with a shudder into a pool of blood . Now on her own , the wife emerges from her hiding place , outwits and kills the two goons , and finally plugs the motel manager . It's done by the numbers and it sucks . The first fifteen minutes are a set up for what might have been an interesting thriller , but the prologue is quickly passed and what we have on our hands is two innocent folks being pursued by murderous baboons . Oh , a lone , state cop stops to poke around a bit . He's old and wheezing , and the minute we see him we know he's toast . There are murders by strangling , stabbing , shooting , being crushed against a wall by a speeding car , and by generic trauma . That's not counting the two screaming naked girls we see being manhandled and finally terminated on the videotapes . A dead body comes back to life , but it's not the maniac , it's the supposedly dead husband . It uses every cheap shock trick in The Handbook of Cheap Shots . You can't count the number of times those masked faces pop up in unexpected places , out of the shadows . If you reach your Biblically allotted life span of 70 years , your heart will have beaten 2 , 358 , 720 , 000 ( that's billion , with a B ) . That's how many times a hand or a body darts in from out of the frame to attack one of the victims . If you like seeing innocent people terrified , chased and slaughtered - - especially naked young women - - this is your film . What a piece of meretricious crap . If you want to see a very good movie about a spooky motel run by a maniac , watch Alfred Hitchcock's " Psycho . "
Bubble Bathos .	Plot : Dennis Cromwell ( Sam Bottoms ) is a prosperous banker with a wife and new baby girl in Marin County . He's friends with his roofer , Enrique ( Marco Rodrigues ) whose teen-aged daughter is Bottoms ' baby sitter . The perky daughter ( Yeniffer Behrens ) develops a crush on Bottoms and they begin an affair . She's also being stalked by a hook-nosed guy but forget that . The affair is discovered . Bottoms ' wife leaves him , taking the infant and the house with her . He's fired from the bank . He's charged with statutory rape and shunned by the community . Behrens is taken away from him , sobbing . He hasn't a friend left in the world . At the end he's involved in a homicide and Lord only knows what sort of moral terpitude he'll be charged with now . And all this time you thought Cromwell was a Puritan ? It's really difficult to describe this movie . The plot is done and redone , young girl has affair with older married man . " The Crush " is typical . Usually they stink although , as " Lolita " demonstrates , the story , if not the films , can be sublimely told . I don't know exactly whose fantasy this film is aimed at - - the middle-aged man lusting after the tan gymnasticized thighs of a 16-year-old baby sitter or the overpowering love of a naive but nubile girl for a powerful but understanding father figure . Probably both . The roots of these motives lie buried in evolutionary psychology . One of the theories advanced for the incest taboo , though , is well illustrated here . It mixes up the roles in the division of labor . The confusion manifests itself in jealousy or in some African societies in accusations of witchcraft . Nobody knows quite who belongs to whom or who's dominant . You cannot have two wimmin in the same house . Reckon that's a law of life . Signed : Prof . John Wayne , Director of Gender Studies . What is there to say about the movie ? The performances are somewhat below those found in TV commercials ? ( With the possible exception of Marco Rodriguez ' ? Rodriguez has a good scene in which he stands over the body of a recently murdered heavy and crosses himself . Then he spits on the body . ) The direction is flat and uninteresting ? The photography is ambitious but blurry ? The editing confusing ? ( See the scene in which Bottoms and Behrens run to each other and kiss hotly while the gym coach stands by aghast . Next shot , he's missing . ) The script ? People say things like : " We have to talk . " Twice . And once it's a man . Bottoms and Behrens walking along a beach having an earnest discussion about what to do with their lives . Behrens : " You know , in some countries we could be married . " Bottoms : " Yeah , but this isn't one of them . " Behrens : " I know . What a bummer . " It's too bad this is so little other than a minor soap opera because it was shot partly in Millbrae , one of the prettiest little towns on the San Francisco peninsula .
COD : Terminal Stupidity .	As these things go , it's not too bad - - about average maybe . It's a revenge story in which an evil and psychotic man , Caulfield , insinuates himself into a normal household . He is the perfect tenant , occupying the guest house in the rear . Like most tenants , or rather like most people , he isn't everything he seems . There are twists and turns in the plot as the tenant first murders Linda Purl's dad , leaving only Purl and her teenage daughter alone in the house - - two helpless women . Oh , and Caulfield has a kind of dumb-witted accomplice , the ex-psychiatric patient played by Traci Nelson . For my part , she takes the acting palm . She looks heftier - - more succulent and less virginal than she did as the nun in that TV series , whatever it was . It helps that hers is the most colorful and least stereotyped role . She's in love with Caulfield and has tracked him down in his new identity . The fact that he doesn't give a hoot about her , that he only took all of her money because that's all he wanted , means nothing to her . The conventionalism of the script ( by Castaldo and Bonin , who I hope isn't trying to be amusing ) doesn't give her any more of a break than Caulfield does . She enters an empty house where he has agreed to meet with her . Just after she's walked through the front door he springs up behind her and begins strangling her . She disables him momentarily , knocking him to the floor , but instead of running back outside she scurries up the stairs , allowing him to follow . He clips her on the jaw and pins her on the bed . " Gulp . I love you , " she manages to gasp , just before he bashes her brains out with a phone . The stupidity continues . The teenage boyfriend of Purl's daughter has agreed to follow Caulfield around to find out who he is . Okay . Caulfield goes into an empty house . A few minutes later , Traci Nelson goes into the house . Pause . The sound of a gun shot . The boy looks puzzled and annoyed . " Now what was that ? " he asks aloud . Shortly Caulfield exits the premises lugging along a stone-heavy crate functional to the extent that it can contain a human dead body . Caulfield heaves the crate up into his trunk and drives to a remote place . One of those " densely wooded areas " where all dead bodies are found , regardless of whether they've been subject to " an execution-style murder " or a " ritual murder . " Anyway - - I hope you're following this - - anyway , Caulfield is spied upon by the teenager while he unloads the crate . It flops open and an arm falls out . So what does the kid do ? Well , precisely the same thing you would do . He goggles , takes out his camera , starts sneaking closer for a better look or a better picture , steps on a twig and cracks it , and is chased through the woods by a murderer armed with a pistol . But - - wait for it - - the kid is a clever boots . He steps from behind a tree and whomps the murderer in the chest with a log , knocking the guy to the ground . The kid picks up the pistol . Caulfield runs away . The kid , instead of beating it back to his car and zipping off into the cerulean horizon , CHASES the killer , shooting wildly at him . He misses with every shot , and it's no wonder . He's holding the pistol in the faddish sideways position he picked up from watching too many action movies . When he empties the pistol , he stands there in a state of tonic immobility , while Caulfield emerges from cover , regains the pistol , puts a new clip in , and - - well , I don't want to spoil it for you . It's not worth going on about . The movie doesn't require a suspension of disbelief . It practically demands the smothering of consciousness itself . Don't miss it if you can .
The difference between God and a doctor .	SPOILERS . It's an old joke . What's the difference between God and a doctor ? God doesn't think he's a doctor . That's Dr . Gene Hackman's problem in this film - - he gets the two identities mixed up . He loses what sociologists call " role distance . " He begins to believe that because he can delay death , he can give life , and give the kind of life he'd like to give . Well , we won't get into that here . Please take my course in Philosophy of Medicine 101 . You'll find the fee surprisingly affordable . Hurry , offer ends at midnight . Actually , " Extreme Measures " illustrates just about everything that can go wrong with what might have been a decent medical thriller . The story itself is pretty plain . Promising young doc roots out unethical shenanigans at higher levels , rather as in Robin Cook's " Coma . " In " Coma " they just did it for the money . Here they do it because they want to practice what Hackman , Chief of the Shenanigans Department , calls " great medicine . " It involves harvesting homeless men , cutting their spinal cords , and more or less encouraging the fusion of the severed nerves . Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't . When young Dr . Hugh Grant begins to suspect something is up and noses around , he is framed for cocaine possession , employee theft , and having a funny hair style . Ruined , he continues his investigation anyway and it ends in violence . Michael Palmer , a doc himself , wrote the novel on which this is based . I haven't read it , but Palmer must be aware of just how closely the methods used by Gene Hackman resemble those of the docs who worked under Hitler . Germany was exterminating people who were identified as medically unfit - - for the most humanitarian of reasons , of course . State-sponsored propaganda films showed movies justifying the pruning of the herd . Well , just look at these poor schizophrenic dudes , a kindly doc explains . Aren't they better off dead ? Later , Jews were used in experiments to determine how long a human body could survive in near-freezing water , presumably to save the lives of sailors who lost their ships in the Baltic . Next to them , Hackman's doc seems only a trifle misguided . Did Palmer have anything to say about this script or did he just get paid and run ? The film goes in for the cheapest kind of shock effects while the plot meanders around . I mean " cheap , " as in hands reaching in from out of the frame and grabbing the hero by the shoulder . Unimaginative too . When Hugh Grant gets his nose bashed in , he suffers from nothing more than a colorful trickle from one nostril to his lip . Didn't the writers ever see a fist fight in a schoolyard ? Punched in the nose , the victim bleeds like Niagara and when he tries to wipe it off he smears it all over his lower face . ( Cf . , Ben Johnson in " Shane " for how it ought to be done . ) At one point , Grant is told that he has a break in the 8th vertebra . Later , he sobs to his girl friend that he has a fracture in C6 ( sixth cervical ) when it should be T1 ( first thoracic ) . Or is that wrong ? I was never good at numbers . Way deep down underground in New York City live " the mole people , " from whom Hackman gets his experimental subjects . They're so terrifying that even the normal homeless people who live above ground are afraid to go down there . But Grant does and he finds an angry and suspicious community that looks made up of extras who have been told to dress down . Raggedy clothes , yes , and maybe greasy hair and odd faces , but not TOO extraordinary . Most are freshly shaved , and they speak like high school graduates making a public speech - - being sure to add the " g " at the end of a word like " going " . This is directorial sloppiness . Most of the homeless are mentally ill , uneducated , and without material or social resources , bankrupt in every sense . They could not organize a cohesive group . They couldn't organize a trip to a hot dog stand . It's a minor shame in a way , because there may be a decent thriller lurking in this plot somewhere . Alas , nobody found it , presumably because nobody was looking for it . Everyone involved seems to have taken the easy way out and settled for cash .
By the numbers .	It follows the formula as if in a Marine boot camp . Strictly lockstep . A nice young doctor , his beautiful wife , and two lovely kiddies move out of the city and buy a ranch house in a small town . The house seems to have everything they want . It even has a large , well-stocked wine cellar . The cellar is always dark , cluttered , and musty . One after another , townspeople begin to die mysteriously . The young doctor , Jeff Daniels , an arachnophobe , thinks something is going on and asks for autopsies . The old doctor , Henry Jones , the one who refuses to retire , disagrees vehemently . Nobody believes Daniels . The people of the village scorn him and tease his children . The local infestation controller ( " exterminator " to you ) is matter-of-fact about the affair . Then the old doctor himself becomes a victim and Daniels finally gets his autopsies . Spiders did it . An forensic arachnologist , or whatever he is , Julian Sands , is called in on the case . He identifies the culprit as a deadly Venezuelan species that is organized like the social insects - - termites , bees , ants , and so forth . They have drones , workers , scullery maids , boot blacks , queens , and all that . Then , more or less suddenly , the little creatures are all over the place , dropping from the ceilings , crawling into the shower to spy on Daniel's teen aged daughter , proving that they're not entirely evil . A final confrontation involves the wine cellar , Daniels , and the queen of spiders , now grown to the size of an elephant seal . The direction isn't bad , given the idiocy of the plot . What can you do with a thousand spiders except have them crawl all over the place and leap at people from hidden places ? What else can you have them do ? A toe dance to the incidental music from " Rosamunde " ? Form a twenty-foot pyramid like tiny circus acrobats ? In case you're in any doubt about what you're supposed to be thinking and feeling , the musical score stuffs innumerable cues down your throat . Yes , when Daniels explores the wine cellar or the barn with a flashlight , it's a spooky scene . You can tell because the violins are going orgasmic with tremolo . Jeff Daniels , by the way , is the perfect actor for a role like this . His instrument only has one note . Not that that's necessarily bad , because Gary Cooper only had one and a half . That marmoreal aspect fits precisely . If he were more expressive he'd have become screaming mad by the movie's end . The film is bound to leave its mark on the history of cinematic mediocrity .
Come Fly With Me !	It is said that there are some people out there who actually ADMIRE Monogram's movies . Well - - and why not ? Monogram Studios lived on a kind of Cost Plus basis ; cost , plus enough to pay the rent and buy a pizza and a bottle of robust muscatel every once in a while . Sure , they're cheap . But let's face it : they're coarse , fast , Philistine , vulgar , but exhilarating . They have no pretensions at all . They're designed to divert the audience for an hour or so at the bottom of a double bill . So what if John Wayne gallops through the Wild West along a road lined with telephone poles ? This isn't art , it's entertainment . Take this movie , " Flight to Mars . " At the beginning , when we're first meeting the characters , a man might introduce his female companion abruptly , avoiding any tedious subtlety : " Professor , this is my fiancée and assistant , who is a rocket scientist and a beautiful woman . She loves me but is growing impatient with me because I'm always wrapped up in my scientific work . Perhaps you could steal her from me , marry her , give her the babies and the picket-fenced home she yearns for . If necessary I will die on this journey to see her dreams realized . Also , she likes it a little rough . " It saves a lot of writing and shooting time , doesn't it ? That's what people mean when they say a narrative is " fast " . ( This one was shot in five days . ) Why should we have to hint about these things ? I mean , what the hell is this , a cheap sci fi movie or Henry James ? Actually this is a particularly well-funded example of a Monogram movie . It's in color , for one thing . " Cinecolor " to be exact . ( You can tell it's not any other " color " you'd recognize . ) And look at the cast . The female lead is dismissible , as is usual with Monogram , but the male leads are definitely up there on the B List . Cameron Mitchell as the reporter , yet to hit his stride as a male lead , which , come to think of it , he never really did . And Arthur Franz as the pipe-smoking head scientist , the pride of Perth Amboy , New Jersey . And - - for science fiction fans - - how about THIS pair of aces : both Morris Ankrum AND John Litel ! There's not really much point in describing the plot in detail . The five crew members crash land on Mars where they find an underground civilization inhabited by organisms whose evolution was isomorphic with ours , right down to their having five digits and willowy babes in short skirts . And they picked up English from listening to our broadcasts . American broadcasts , that is , judging from their speech . They're led by a sinister cabal who try to hijack the space ship , build many imitations of it , and colonize earth . They do not succeed . The special effects aren't very special . The men walk around a couple of spare sets , wearing black costumes with stylized lightning bolts emblazoned on their chests and scarlet capes billowing behind them . Their names consist exclusively of English phonemes - - Alzar , Terris , Ikron . The lissome Martian who falls for Arthur Franz is named Alita , with an Indo-European diminutive appendage , and she already knows what kissing is . Overall , I found it as snappy as it was intended to be , but dull too . The story is that of any Buck Rogers 1930s serial . Once the earthlings and the Martians meet and it's established that they have a common language , and that the Martians have a sinister agenda , that's it . In two hours , even an indifferent screenwriter could turn this into a story of Nazi spies in World War II . The plot is done by the numbers , the dialog has no sparkle , the acting is pedestrian . However , dedicated aficionados of Monogram productions should enjoy it . After all , Jean-Luc Goddard , the contrarian French egghead , dedicated " A Bout de Soufflé " to Monogram , so they can't have been all that bad .
Stillbirth .	Few sequels are as good as the original , but this one is really pretty bad , distilling out of the first version everything that was good and simply throwing it away , then adding some stuff that makes it almost impossible to watch . . Take the title . " The Bourne Identity " actually had meaning . There was a question driving the movie - - just who IS this amnesic guy ? Even the name " Bourne " added a bit of symbolic weight . This one is called " The Bourne Supremacy . " Supremacy in what endeavor ? And why supremacy ? Why not just superiority ? Or even equality ? " The Bourne Equality ? " I guess not . No one could fault the performers , who in other environments have been more than adequate . Matt Damon was good as Mister Ripley , and superb as the guilt-ridden junkie in " Courage Under Fire . " Joan Allen , as always , projects a curious but appealing mixture of fortitude and femininity . Nobody else in the movie counts for much . The plot is more or less dismissible . Bourne is set up and then pursued by some corrupt inner circle of CIA officials and Russians . It has something to do with the privatization of Russian oil , but it all boils down to one long chase . What really dismembers the movie is the direction and the editing . If you can imagine Oliver Stone on meth , you'll get the general picture . There is , first , a terrible imposition of directorial self display during some scenes . A blurry step-motion murder . A zapped up memory flashback in negative . But that in itself wouldn't be so awful . The problem is that it never stops . The camera seems to be ataxic . I can't remember a single scene in which it held still . It wobbles pointlessly all over the place or it focuses on some unimportant object like a venetian blind while the action takes place elsewhere , as if the director had been weaned on MTV or one of those TV commercials for a brokerage firm or a toothpaste whitener . ( " I was afraid to smile in public until I discovered Dentabrite with Endorphin . " ) Let me give an example . Jason Bourne is doing some library research . He's reading microfiche of newspaper items in Russian and English and turns up some important information . The camera shows us the articles and the associated photographs - - but it WOBBLES so we can't read anything . There are dozens of ways of giving a viewer the gist of a story without asking him or her to read the details of the article . Erroll Morris showed us one effective way - - just hold the camera on the header . But this aimless wavering is positively irritating . The editing is equally poor . Every change of scene seems to be a cut , not a dissolve . And the cuts come fast and thick - - say every few seconds . Objects zoom aimlessly in and out of focus . And the director is given to lightning-quick pans , often past unidentifiable dark objects . If the direction and editing are a major problem during most of the movie , they turn into insurmountable obstacles during action scenes . A furious mano a mano shows us one-second glimpses of a fist here , a foot there , a knife skittering along the floor , a window breaking . The obligatory car chase comes towards the end , with the possible novelty of having been actually filmed in the gray streets and tunnels of Moscow , but the promise is unfulfilled . Each shot lasts a second or so and gives us mostly details - - Bourne's grimace at the wheel of his speeding taxi , a pistol being fired by somebody whose identity we must guess , cars chasing cars chasing cars chasing a car - - the movie should have been called " Chasing Sanbourne . " ( That was a wretched play on words . Can I take it back ? ) You know why the original " Bourne Identity " was above average , at least in my humble opinion ? It had a better plot , for one thing . We were as interested as Bourne himself in finding his identity . For another thing , it had a developing relationship between Bourne and the girl ( Famke Potente ) whose car he hires . For another , there was violence , but it was not done to the viewer . The fights were unexpected , brutal , and staged in such a way that we could follow the events . And finally , the original gave us a chance to breathe between the zaps , an opportunity to learn something about the characters and their situations , about the kinds of music they listen to on a car radio . All of that - - and more - - is missing from this meretricious attempt to make a few bucks by tapping into the inelastic demand of an audience of viewers whose heads are as empty as their intolerance of boredom is great . I don't mean to cast aspersions on people who may have enjoyed this movie more than I did , just on the people who assembled it with that audience in mind .
Exciting , didactic , pastiche .	This film has virtually nothing to do with the original " Memphis Belle " of 1944 , except I suppose that it involves the crew of a B-17 on their final mission . Maybe a few duplicate shots . That's about it . Two notably good things about it . One is that it gives us the feeling of what it's really like to be aboard a bomber in combat , or at least I think it does , never having been in that situation myself . They've convinced me though . On the ground the big airplane shivers from the vibration of the four engines like a Magic Fingers mattress . Everyone and everything jiggles at high frequency . We see bombs armed in flight . We see what the target looks like through the bombardier's sight . We feel the airplane lurch upward after the couple of tons worth of bombs are released . And we catch some of the dynamics of the crew . The bombardier has posed as a doctor . One waist gunner plays grab with the other's religious medallion . The other outstanding feature is the aerial photography , or the computer-generated images . Everything is so crisp , so clean , so sky blue , except for those black blotches ahead and the drab B-17s droning their way to and from hell . It's extremely exciting too , once it gets off the ground . That's part of the problem . Everything we see happening to the Memphis Belle happened to one 8th Air Force bomber or another , but never to the same airplane on the same mission . It's as if all the very real dangers facing these fliers had been put into a duck press and slapped onto the plot . If you've seen airplane-in-jeopardy movies before , you'll find little that's innovative here . A man dangling out of a hole in the fuselage ( twice ) . The near miss after takeoff . The sight of a buddy's ship going down . Should we throw the badly wounded radio operator out with a parachute over Germany in hopes that his life will be saved ? We're running out of fuel - - throw out everything we don't need . Let's sing Danny Boy for good luck . The whole film is derivative , from the beginning to the end , and everything is spelled out in big letters like a child's alphabet book . The opening lines from a PR officer tell us a lot . " Let's see now . We have a guy from Omaha , then an Irishman from Boston , " or something like that . The PR officer ( John Lithgow ) turns out to be a knucklehead ( " Baloney is my business " ) but that doesn't stop the writers from using him as the crudest tool of exposition . The opening scene , a drunken party , is ripped off from " Das Boot , " only here , in case you didn't know why the party was taking place , it's made plain for you . " I don't want to die ! " one drunk screams at the sky . In " Das Boot " Wolfgang Peterson let you figure out for yourself that despair led to drunkenness . His writers thought you had enough in the way of inferential abilities to pick it up . These writers don't . The dialog is ludicrous , right out of a 1944 funnybook . Captain to crew : " Let's make this our best bomb run ever . " Crew member : " Right down the pickle barrel ! " Captain : " You bet ! " Captain to crew : " Boys , nobody ever said this was gonna be all fun and games . We're here to do a job so let's do it . If we don't do it somebody else will have to come back and do it . " There is virtually no swearing . It's alright for us to see a man's blood and guts splattered all over the nose , but we aren't allowed to hear a terrified or a wounded man shout or or even . I think the most nauseating bit that's included in this movie , from the point of view of poetics , is the damned dog . See , as in all other bombing movies , the ground crew are waiting tensely for the return of " their " airplanes and crew . They play desultory softball to distract themselves but glance into the skies from time to time . They have a dog . The dog mirrors the anxiety of the men , skulking around and looking worried . At one point he flops onto his belly , his chin buried in his paws , and seems to be looking airward . I think this is known as the pathetic fallacy . At least the writers left out the conflict of crew members about some mixed up love affairs back on the ground . Well - - the film may serve its didactic purpose anyway . Kids who don't know why this war was called World War TWO may learn something from it . ( A student at a well-known university once complimented Barbara Tuchman after a lecture on World War I , saying he'd always wondered why the other was called WWII . ) For the rest of us , if you can stomach that dog you can get through an exciting and well-photographed war movie .
A War of Necessity	All the combatants seemed to sidle into the First World War crabwise , without really intending to do much other than preserve national pride , and then , before you know it , kaboom . Barbara Tuchman , who wrote the prize-winning history " Guns of August , " used to tell the story of a lecture she gave at a famous Midwestern university and being congratulated by a student for making the casus belli so clear . " I'd always wondered why they called the other one World War Two , " said the student . Not that " British Intelligence " is about World War I anyway . It's set in 1917 but it was shot in 1940 as a spy mystery that shifted back and forth from Berlin to London . Except for some differences in uniforms and the use of Zeppelins instead of Heinkels , it's really World War II the movie is dealing with . The movie's speeches , which I won't bother repeating , practically hit us over the head with the real conflict . And here the Americans enter the war without having to be bombed into doing so . Boris Karloff is an obsequious French butler in a classy London house where all the British high staff seem to meet and trade secrets in front of open windows and whatnot . Karloff had his hands on some good roles in his time - - " Frankenstein " , " The Body Snatchers " - - but this role demonstrates his weaknesses . He overplays it outrageously , fawning and bowing , and saying things like , " Here , let me help you with your coat . " And his French accent is execrable . " Zeppelin " comes out " Zepp-lawn . " Better he shouldn't have tried at all . The other performances are decent enough and there's nothing awry with the direction but it's rather a long , slow slog through hidden identities and intrigues . On the whole it's like watching a very old screenplay that has been dug up out of a shoe box on the back shelf and refurbished by Second Spin Ltd . It's not insulting - - it's not that bad - - it's just rather routine and dull .
Emma Bovary : Sensation Type .	Carl Jung , the Swiss psychologist , posited four types of personalities : the sensation type , the feeling type , the thinking type , and the intuitive type . Now , your typical sensation type ( lecturer points to portrait of Madame Bovary ) lives for the moment , switches allegiances on impulse , luxuriates in the indulgence of her sensory apparatus , cannot be depended upon , and is insensitive to the feelings of others except as they affect her . We may forgive a sensation type , but are we really supposed to like her ? Says who ? That's kind of how I felt about this story . I'd heard as a youngster that this was supposed to be a sexy novel . It was known as " Madame Ovary . " So I tried to struggle through it but gave up because it seemed boring . Maybe in French there were grace notes in the prose , absent from the English translation . But I really don't know how anything could have saved this from being a weeper . The viewer gets the general idea quickly enough because the narrator , James Mason , gives it to us right off the bat . The young , poor Emma Bovary ( Jennifer Jones ) lives in a world of romantic fantasy , a kind of Ruritania of the mind , with dashing knights and love in Swiss chalets . Her walls are plastered with illustrations from fairy tales . And she never outgrows this world of make-believe . She doesn't have enough insight to know that marrying the devoted but dull village doctor ( Van Heflin , in a good , bumbling performance ) is not the answer . She attributes her dissatisfaction to her need for a child , a boy . She eventually has the child , but it's a girl and the girl rejects her in favor of her husband and her housekeeper . And who wouldn't reject Emma ? Half the time she's hysterical , and the other half she's about to become hysterical . Anyway , the next thing you know , Emma has taken up with the local clerk and , when he's booted over to Rouen by his domineering mother , she takes up with the handsome , dashing , narcissistic , rich Rodolphe Boulanger ( Louis Jordan ) . She decorates poor Doctor Bovary's house in expensive fabrics and furniture , borrowing secretly from a stone-faced usurer who will in the end bring her and her family down by selling the notes , which means bankruptcy for the Bovarys . She throws herself at the feet of an erstwhile lover and begs for money . " I haven't got it , " he says , and throws her out . In an excess of self-pity ( I didn't notice much in the way of guilt ) she eats some arsenic and is called away to answer to a higher authority . The movie has one or two neat set pieces , directed by Vincent Minelli . There's the scene at the first ball to which the Bovarys are invited , the ball at which Emma first dances with Rodolphe and the awkward , anxious husband gets drunk . I'm not much for balls . Everybody gets dressed up and dances in circles . " I don't know how to waltz , " Emma tells Rodolphe . Well , Emma , neither does anyone else now . In a college class I was trying to get across the notion of dialectics and asked for a volunteer from the audience to help me demonstrate the waltz step . No volunteers because nobody knew how to waltz - - or what a waltz was , for that matter . Minelli sets up this ball , though , so that it's not nearly as boring as most . The guys are boozing it up , the women look gorgeous in their elaborate Walter Plunkett gowns , and when one of the ladies feel dizzy from dancing the host orders attendants to bash out the windows . There is also a wild wedding scene that might have come from Pieter Bruegel or maybe Sam Pekinpah's " Ride the High Country . " Jennifer Jones is Emma with a breathless lisp . Van Heflin is nearly perfect as the humble , inarticulate doctor . ( Doctors in the 1850s weren't as high in the status-sphere as they are today . If they had been , Emma would have been not only foolish to betray her husband but downright loco . ) This role must have stereotyped Louis Jordan because he seemed to play little but the same careless French lover in film after film . However , although I may not have gotten very much out of it , others might . I haven't looked at the user's ratings but I'd be mildly surprised if women didn't give it a higher score than men . Sensation types of either gender are likely to switch channels before it's over .
Red Herrings in the Fog .	In some ways the best touch in this movie , efficiently directed by Philip Kaufman , comes at the climax . ( Caution : spoilers ahead ) Ashley Judd as the chief suspect is a serial murder case is forced to watch her avuncular mentor , Samuel Jackson , blow his brains out at the end of a foggy San Francisco pier and flop into the nightime water of the bay . As the sound of the shot fades , we hear the barking of distant sea lions roused from their sleep . That's just about it for the good touches , except to say that the performances are good , as we might expect from such a cast . The location shooting isn't bad either , avoiding many of the clichés found in San Francisco movies . ( No car chases down Vermont St . ) Frankly it's the plot that well and truly sucks . Ashley Judd is a decent actress but the part calls for her to be a casually and aggressively promiscuous police officer who always dresses in black , right down to her underwear . Don't get me wrong . She looks just fine in leather jackets , and in black underwear too for that matter . But she seems tiny , chubbily childlike , innocent , and this macho stuff doesn't come easily to her . And the role itself is almost an impossibility . It's one of those deals in which the investigator keeps coming up with more and more evidence that he or she is the criminal . Not too much effort is put into explaining this . Something to do with " bad blood . " And there are plenty of red herrings in San Francisco Bay . There are a couple of ex-boy friends who know all her habits and might be responsible . Then there's Andy Garcia as a potentially new boy friend . Is he killing all her ex-lovers out of jealousy ? Is it someone whom she does not know but has been studying her habits ? Is it a complete stranger ? Is it really serial suicide in which several unrelated men first torture themselves with cigarettes and then pound their own faces to a pulp with some kind of martial arts wooden instrument that looks like a dildo ? And how ABOUT those sea lions ? I've made it sound kind of silly , but that's okay because it is . I like it as much as I do because it's more of a mystery than another boring action flick . There's a bit of the old ultra violence but only one shot is fired on film and , in fact , there aren't showers of gore and exploding fireballs as somebody's car rolls off the road . I wish more effort had been put into pruning the mystery , into making it more logical , into filling in plot holes . Well - - two examples . One : Can a completely loony serial murderer turn his rage off for 15 or 20 years and then decide to turn it on again ? How does he manage to keep his job at the post office or wherever if he's so bonkers ? Why doesn't his explanation of the murders make sense ? ( That was all in the way of one example . ) Example Two : We find out that Ashley Judd couldn't have committed the murders because she'd been rendered unconscious by a drug someone put into her wine . Okay . Then how come she wakes up one morning after another victim has just been pounded to death and she finds she has a black eye and some blood on her ? How do you commit self-echymosis , especially when you're asleep ? And why does the drug turn out to be a " date-rape " drug with a long name ? And why is such emphasis placed on the fact ? Why not just a plain old safe chloral hydrate cocktail ? End of example two . I could go on but won't bother . Man , this is a muddled story . I don't know how such a talented cast and director became involved in it - - or why Veronica Cartwright is reduced to a featured bit part so small that she is uncredited . But then this movie leaves a lot of questions unanswered .
Weak murder mystery .	It starts off alright , as a kind of " Goodfellas " dealing with a Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis team in the 1950s . Kevin Bacon's narration , both matter-of-fact and kinda surprised , carries the viewer along in exposing the corrupt underbelly of the Martin-Lewis bonhomie . But the problems crop up rather quickly . What can this movie tell us about Martin and Lewis that Jerry Lewis hasn't told us already ? But that's the best part . After the introduction to the phoniness behind the act and the telethons , it turns into a routine murder mystery , and a not very interesting one . No - - more than just not very interesting . Absurd . Ionesco couldn't have developed a more bizarre plot than one of the comedy team , a homosexual in the oppressive 1950s , murdering an exploitative young woman and the team , in a panic and still stoned on Tuinal , packing her body in a crate full of lobsters and ice and shipping it from Miami to Newark . The only thing is - - the butler did it . I swear I'm not making this up . Most of the acting is okay , except for Alyson Lohman as the central figure . She looks fine and should have a flourishing career in afternoon romantic dramas . Kevin Bacon is pretty good . As he's aging , he's acquiring some character . His face seems now kind of monkeyish but not at all unpleasant , and his voice is a deep-throated kek kek koaxx koaxx . When he tells his story in voice-over we can believe him . As an entirely , though , the movie isn't worth watching . At least I don't think so . Others might . It's not so poor as to be either insulting or funny . It seems more confused than anything else .
Pointless Gore Fest .	I don't know anything of the writer's or the director's earlier work so I hadn't brought any prejudices to the film . Based on the brief description of the plot in TV Guide I thought it might be interesting . But implausibility was piled upon implausibility . Each turn of the plot seemed to be an excuse to drag in more bloodshed , gruesome makeup , or special effects . The score was professional and Kari Wuhrer seems like a decent actress but the rest was more than disappointing . It was positively repulsive . I will not go through the vagaries of the narrative but I'll give an example of what I think of as an excess of explicit gore . Chris McKenna goes to an isolated ranch house and pulls the frozen body of his earlier victim ( Wendt ) out of the deep freeze . McKenna had killed Wendt by biting a chunk out of his neck . Now he feels he must destroy the evidence of his involvement in Wendt's demise . ( What are the cops going to do , measure his bite radius ? ) McKenna unwraps Wendt's head and neck from the freezer bag it's in , takes an ax , and begins to chop off Wendt's head . Whack . Whack . Whack . The bit of the ax keeps chipping away at Wendt's neck . The air is filled with nuggets of flying frozen flesh , one of which drops on McKenna's head . ( He brushes it off when he's done . ) McKenna then takes the frozen head outside to a small fire he's built . He sits the head on the ground , squats next to it , takes out some photos of a woman he's just killed , and shows them to Wendt's head . " Remember her ? We could have really made it if it hadn't been for you guys , " he tells the head . " Duke , you've always liked bonfires , haven't you ? " he asks . Then he places the head on the fire . We only get a glimpse of it burning but we can hear the fat sizzling in the flame . I don't want this sort of garbage to be censored . I'm only wondering who enjoys seeing this stuff . There's no reason to go on with the rest of the movie . Well , I'll mention one example of an " implausibility , " since I brought the idea up . McKenna has been kidnapped and locked in a dark bare shack . He knows he's going to be clobbered half to death in the following days . ( He's literally invited the heavies to do it . ) What would you do in this Poe-like situation ? Here's what McKenna does on what may turn out to be the last night of his life . He finds a discarded calendar with a pin-up girl on it and masturbates ( successfully ) . Give that man the Medal of Freedom ! A monster who looks like Pizza the Hut is thrown into some unnecessary flashbacks . The camera is often hand held and wobbly . The dialog has lines like , " Life is a piece of s . Or else it's the best of all possible worlds . It depends on your point of view . " Use is made of a wide angle lens that turns ordinary faces into gargoyle masks . A house blows up in an explosive fireball at the end while the hero , McKenna , walks towards us in the foreground . Some hero he is , too . He first kills a man for $13 , 000 by bashing him over the head several times with a heavy statue , then a potted plant , before finally tipping a refrigerator over onto the body . ( This bothers him a little , but not enough to keep him from insisting on payment . ) Then , I hope I have the order straight , he kills Wendt by ripping out part of his neck . Then he kills the wife of his first victim by accident and blames the heavies for it , although by almost any moral calculus they had nothing to do with it . Next he burns the head honcho ( Baldwin ) alive . Then , having disabled the two lesser heavies , he deliberately blows them up , though one of them isn't entirely unsympathetic . And we're supposed to be rooting for McKenna . These aren't cartoon deaths like those in the Dirty Harry movies either - - bang bang and you're dead . These are slow and painful . The first one - - the murder for $13 , 000 - - is done clumsily enough to resemble what might happen in real life . It isn't really easy to kill another human being , as Hitchcock had demonstrated in Torn Curtain . But that scene leads to no place of any importance . Some people might enjoy this , especially those young enough to think that pain and death are things that happen only in movies . Some meretricious stuff on screen here .
Is there such a thing as trying too hard ?	A based-on-fact story of Jimmy Piersall , a major league player of the 1950s who suffered what looks like a major depression with some paranoid ideas . Not much could be done with major league mental illnesses at the time , before the French accidentally discovered anti-psychotic meds . The movie ends , as all such movies do whenever possible , on an up-beat note with Piersall ( Tony Perkins ) returning to the Red Sox after defeating his demons . I have no idea how closely the movie sticks to the real facts of Piersall's life , but it certainly hews close to the formula line . Basically , everything is blamed on Piersall's father ( Karl Malden ) , who pushed the kid too hard , brutally sometimes , to excel . Nothing would do but that Piersall not only play for the Sox but that he play the OUTFIELD . Shortstop wasn't good enough . Poor kid . While still in the minors , in Scranton , he brags to his pop that he's the third highest hitter in the league . Malden smiles and says , " Well , that's not first . " Think about that , next time your kid comes home with a B plus on his report card . You want to drive him nuts ? I don't doubt that Piersall's father was pushy about his son's training and career . For all we know there may be as many sports fathers as there are stage mothers . But it seems a bit unfair to make him the sole heavy . It's not easy to drive someone crazy , not as easy as it seems in the movies anyway . It helps a lot , especially with major affective disorders , if you bring something genetic to the party , as numerous studies have shown . Not that genetics explains everything , because one identical twin may " get it " while the other doesn't . Anyway , the movie isn't very satisfying , as a movie . The director , Robert Mulligan , has done better work elsewhere . And Tony Perkins gives a by-the-numbers performance as a madman , with his facial muscles trembling and his eyes bulging . How primitive can you get ? He was a much better ( if entirely different ) kind of psychotic in " Psycho . " An improved script might have helped him . Malden is okay as the well-meaning but destructive father whom Perkins finally tells off at the cathartic climax . Perkins ' wife's role is underwritten and doesn't contribute much as Malden's potential rival . It would have been nice too if we'd seen a little more about baseball , the sport and the career ladder , and less of the formulaic material on having a breakdown . At least your performance on the baseball diamond is something you can do something about . In the grip of mental illness like Piersall's , you're practically helpless , and that's not too dramatic .
The One With Patrick O'Neal as Villainous Architect	Peter Falk , as Lieutenant Columbo , the sartorial shambles , is always stumbling into some elitist milieu - - championship chess , haute cuisine , oenology , Beverley Hills , or whatnot . This time it's architecture . And Peter O'Neal , perennial heavy with the gargling baritone , is the bad guy who murders a client that objects to O'Neal's building a monument to his own vanity . Or something . The motive isn't really very clear , nor does it matter . The homicide is just a springboard for Columbo's adventures in a new setting , among snobby characters . But , man , does he deflate them . Not in the middle of the story , no . He's always polite . He's always puzzled when they take offense at his insinuations . In this one he doesn't drop the hammer until the last three or four minutes . Until then we have the usual dual of wits between the arrogant O'Neal and the self-deprecating detective . And the comic interludes , which we must not forget . I generally like the comedy a lot because it's built not around pratfalls or wit but around ordinary human foibles or the frustrations that seem built into quotidian experience . Here , a doctor gives him a quick exam and advises him sternly to quit smoking cigars . Columbo , looking worried , leaves the examining room feeling his chest . In another instance , he gets stuck in two of those long lines that everyone encounters at banks or post offices or bureaucratic services . It's pretty funny and not a word is spoken . O'Neal makes a good heavy , too . As the heroine tells him in " The Stepford Wives , " " You don't look like a person who would enjoy making others happy . " Pam Austin is still beautiful but her acting talents are modest . Janis Paige is a lot of fun as usual , just one of the guys except that she happens to be a pretty woman . Forrest Tucker appears in a few early scenes as the victim . Next to O'Neal , he seems a Mount Everest of accumulated flab . Peter Falk directed it competently and without flair . It's a journeyman job , overall .
Martin Landau is Twins .	In this one , Martin Landau , plays estranged identical twins who team up on the sly to knock off their rich uncle , Paul Stewart . Stewart , the old goat , plans to marry a new-age Julie Newmar who is half his age . I didn't mind so much seeing Paul Stewart die by batter mixer in his own bathtub , but throwing Julie Newmar out the window was unforgivable . The entire sequence of events isn't revealed until the end , which is an anomaly in the Columbo series . But of course Columbo , Peter Falk , is gifted with his usual second sight . The mere notice of a damp bath towel in the laundry hamper puts him on the right track . A TV screen that turns too purple at the wrong moment clinches it for him . And , as usual , the culprits crumble in the end before a positive molehill of suggestive evidence . Columbo's villains tend to have brains but no guts . He's his usual disheveled self - - cigar , rumpled raincoat , a man of infinite hesitations . He has comic encounters with the Martin Landau twin who is a television personality . Landau invites Columbo to leave the audience and come up and join him before the cameras in making hollandaise sauce . Columbo makes a fool of himself , but Landau laughs too loudly and so does the audience . The hilarity is forced and the incident is rather more silly than funny . ( See Columbo try to separate the yoke from the white ! ) The scene would have been far funnier if Landau had played it straight and the audience was permitted only the occasional snicker . It's the director's job to see this done . His most amusing encounters are with Jeanette Nolan as the housekeeper , the impeccable Mrs . Peck . You could perform surgery on the floors she's kept for thirty years for the horny old Paul Stewart character , and here comes Columbo , bumbling along , trailing cigar ashes , using a three thousand dollar silver dish as an ash tray , trying to fix Mrs . Peck's TV set only to pull off the knobs . It's not the best in the series , but it's early Columbo , when the ideas were still fresh - - Steven Bochco was the writer - - and overall it's an entertaining divertimento .
Better To Listen to WGBH .	The first thing that you may notice about this film , and the last , is the sound track . It's all pretty quiet . You don't hear the big jet engines screaming . People can speak softly . The only person who shouts is Jodie Foster , and then only to scream : " WHERE'S MY BABY ? " There's no musical score worth mentioning , but the incidental sounds - - Wow ! If a door aboard the airliner closes , or if a body falls softly to the carpeted deck , the action is accompanied by a loud WHOMP on the sound track , sometimes with a cowbell or two thrown in . And if somebody should be struck in the face by a small woman wielding a fire extinguisher , the sound rivals Krakatoa . Sometimes you get " whomps " for no reason at all except that there's a cut from one scene to another . The basis for all this , of course , is the disappearance of Jody Foster's daughter on an airplane flying from Munich to New York . There is no record of her having been aboard . No one has seen her , and so forth . The Captain searches the ship but never believes her . This is familiar territory for anyone who's seen Alfred Hitchcock's " The Lady Vanishes . " Hitchcock's effort was kind of rollicking fun , full of japes and wisecracks , sometimes outright silly . But it was fun . " Flightplan " begins along the same lines , but as a dramatic mystery . From there it turns into a " woman in jep " movie . And by the climax has reached the caligian depths of Your Standard Typical Action Movie , with a crazy hijacker pursuing a child-carrying Foster through the bowels of the giant airplane , which altogether seems about the size of the Vanderbilt House in North Carolina . And a darn good thing it is , too , that Foster should happen to be a propulsion engineer , because she knows her way around that monstrous crate to the extent that she can disable the plane without endangering the passengers . She has an awesome memory when you come right down to it . The interior of the avionics section looks like the inside of Hal's brain , yet she knows precisely which jack to pull out of which plug to cause the oxygen masks to pop out of their cabinets , and which lead to short out so the lights blow in the passenger cabins . Now that's saying a lot for a propulsion engineer , I would think , but I was glad anyway , because without that eidetic imagery she would have been even harder put to outwit the hijackers . ( Yes , there's a hijack plot , but it doesn't involve the Arabs aboard . They're nothing but red herrings , or red couscous . ) Knowing , as we do , that there are explosives aboard that can be detonated with the flick of a finger , we expect an explosion and we get it . ( So does the heavy . ) Foster The Child-Carrier , to give her a suitably Homeric epithet , manages to survive the gigantic blast and emerges from the smoke in slow motion and intact , to the awe and delight of the onlookers . Jody Foster is pretty good , as usual . She an accomplished actress . And she's finally beginning to look more mature than she did 36 years ago in " Taxi Driver " . Peter Sarsgaard is , regrettably , not a good heavy . He's not a heavy at all . He's somebody's reserved but sensible cousin or best friend , that's what he is . I mean , if the movie is going to go this cheap route , then please , for God's sake , spare us the complexity involved in matching Sarsgaard's benign presence with his role . ( He was a good maniac in " Boys Don't Cry , " though . ) There's a really enjoyable movie out there about the disappearance of a person from a moving vehicle . It doesn't involve an airplane though . ( I don't care much for airplanes anyway , since I was once involved in a coincidental encounter between an airplane on the one hand and the Atlantic Ocean on the other . ) This enjoyable movie that I'm referring to takes place on a train . It's called " The Lady Vanishes . "
The Detective as non-Cartesian	Lee Remick , with fluffy hair and overactive glands , tells separated hubby Frank that she wishes they could get together again . She doesn't know why not . " We know the reasons , Karen , but understanding's not enough , is it ? " It's not what you think that counts , it's how you act . Boy , this movie is pretty dated . The local gays are rounded up like cattle and shoved around , sometimes brutally . This generally doesn't happen anymore . Not that the NYPD has become more tolerant ; it's just that they don't care so much . Homosexuality here is treated as " the love that dare not speak its name . " ( Now it's become the love that sometimes can't seem to shut up . ) I've never understood the nature of Sinatra's appeal . He doesn't seem the least bit handsome to me , and his voice deteriorated badly after his late 1950s hits . But he has turned in a few good performances , " From Here to Eternity , " " The Manchurian Candidate , " " Suddenly , " and this one . He's not bad . He brings a lot of autobiographical stuff to the part . " I'll give you a rap in the mouth " was a common expression in the urban corridor of New Jersey when he was growing up in Hoboken . My old man used to say it all the time . The other performances are okay too . Interesting to see Duval in an early role . And Loyd Bochner is his usual , smooth , hair-slicked-back overwhelmingly Hollywoodian handsome self . ( But the cinematography is pretty low . All gloomy blues and greens , like " Madigan , " or maybe it was just the film itself . ) The director has a bad habit . He has the characters speak their lines to one another while looking directly into the camera . ( Damn Godard ! ) I don't know what he expected to accomplish by overusing this technique . I don't feel more " involved " with the characters or with the story . When Lee Remick stares at me from the screen , her lips aquiver , and tells me some secret , I just think that she must be uncomfortable talking to a machine . And when old blue eyes stares at me in close up and tries to give me a big smile , it is I who feel uncomfortable ! ( The technique might work quite well in some interactive skin flick . ) Detective Leland is not an uninteresting character . It must have been a revelation in 1968 that a cop could know anything about playwrights like Shaw and O'Casey . But we've learned that lesson by now , what with Serpico and the ballet and all . Also , like Serpico , we have a cop here who is guided by very strict ethical values . This is a guy who knows right from wrong , and who believes in personal responsibility , a moral paragon . He has some interesting exchanges with Bochner , the doc , toward the end , when he discovers that he , Frank , is responsible for the death of an innocent man , and not for innocent reasons either . The Doc ( Frank hates shrinks ) tries to relieve him of his guilt , but Frank is not to be had so easily . He sees through the Doc's ploy and takes responsibility for his own acts , as the pop psychologists used to say . It isn't what you think , it's how you behave that counts . There is a subplot involving some organization called " Rainbow . " The leaders of the borough all belong to it . What they do is buy up property and sell it to each other . Then when the price is high enough , they put on their borough-leader hats and buy it from themselves as property for a hospital or whatever , at a profit . " Once that's done with , " says Frank , " there isn't enough money left to build a birdhouse . " I don't get this , not having an MBA or anything . Where is Sir John Templeton when we need him . At times Frank sounds not only like a drama critic but a positive liberal as well - - " We're sitting on the lid of the garbage cans ( ie . , the ghetto ) and when that lid blows off . . . . . " Even after the obligatory resignation from the force , he is mumbling about doing some sort of social good , but it doesn't sound too convincing . When I was growing up , the local police weren't what most normal people would call liberal . I was clubbed around for throwing a snowball into an empty parking lot . I've seen guys who were kind of drunk in public get pounced on by a dozen men in blue and literally get their teeth pounded out . ( The guy was so drunk , he got up from the cement , said , " Hey bobareebop , somebody got his teeth knocked out , " and he spit them out of his bloody mouth all over the pavement where they bounced about like navy beans . ) You know what ? In any real urban police force in this country , I'd give Frank two minutes before he's out of a job permanently . Know what's striking about this film ? Sinatra plays the Montgomery Clift part in " From Here to Eternity " - - the hard-headed loner , the best man at his job , with his own sense of honor who will not bend his principles to become a success in the organization he loves .
Which color do you like - - the red or the green ?	Action / thriller about Pierce Brosnan as a troubled but wisecracking FBI explosive expert . There's really nothing much new here , but what you see is pretty well done . It's just another professional genre piece . There is the corrupt senator ( Ron Silver ) who's made a fortune from a crooked arms deal . There is the freelance explosive artist ( Ben Cross ) who has learned how to make an explosive substance out of something that looks , acts , and tastes like water until it is activated by stomach acid , when it throws the victim into fits and turns him into a monster bomb . ( ! ) The senator has been making love to Brosnan's wife , which causes Brosnan to drink too much , but they get together at the end , and there is an African-American sidekick who manages to analyze the explosive water , and when Brosnan is cornered by the evildoers in the senator's kitchen he saves himself by making bombs out of ordinary household substances like Vaseline , acetone , alcohol , arugela , salt , pepper , and a touch of marjoram , and - - well , you can guess the rest . It's interesting to watch a human drink a glass of water , fall into an epileptiform seizure , burst his eyeballs with blood , and blow up , leaving only bits and pieces of flesh and shards of bone behind to mark his passing . Pierce Brosnan is a lightweight actor but a likable one . If Ron Silver were more intense he'd be a black hole . Ben Cross is the kind of villain who - - well , here's a scene . Cross is hurrying through his laboratories and the man who invented the secret explosive is scuttling along beside him , reminding Cross that he hasn't been paid yet . Cross says something like , " Yes , you're right . I owe you . " Then he borrows a pen to write a check and , instead , stabs the natterer to death right through the apricot . Near the end , another henchman is stupid enough to claim he's done his job and is leaving now . Right . Cross plugs him in the back . There's no reason for any of this , except to provide a few more colorful deaths , as if there weren't enough . You might find it satisfying if you're in the mood , but I doubt you'll be surprised at much that happens .
Rocks Around the Clock	" The Monolith Monsters " follows the usual scenario of Universal's 1950s monster movies . An ill-understood menace threatens the town ( or the country or mankind ) . Men wearing uniforms try to deal with it , but it's the scientists who come to the rescue . ( Sounds like the Cold War . ) In this case - - in this inexpensive and late case - - the imagination of the writers had just about reached rock bottom . The " monsters " are rock pylons generated by a meteorite . They grow at a phenomenal rate when they are in contact with water , sucking all the silicon out of whatever material they touch , including human flesh . The victims are turned to stone . The meteorite has landed on a mountain top in the desert , but unfortunately a rain storm activates it . These huge black towers grow visibly , then crash and splinter into hundreds of smaller pieces , which grow in turn . The rock itself looks something like obsidian , flinty , shiny , and smoothly fractured . The local geologist and the sheriff are at a loss and they call in " the professor , " whom everyone calls " the professor . " Together with the local newspaper editor ( the reliable Les Tremayne ) and with the help of the supernumerary Lola Albright , they experiment on rock samples and try to find something that will check their growth . Nothing seems to work . The colossal towers are crashing inexorably towards San Angelo and , beyond that , " the citrus region , " after which there will be no stopping them . At the last moment , the antidote is discovered . The rocks stop growing when they are exposed to salt water . And fortunately there is a salt mine just outside town , and next to it a dam which must be blown up , so that the released water can rush over the salt mine and out into the salt flats and tell those rocks where to get off . The formula was getting kind of old by 1957 , I guess . Much of the story is easily anticipated . Some of it is shamelessly ripped off . A young girl at the site of an early and mysterious catastrophe that has killed her parents , is found wandering about in shock . She doesn't blink when a hand is waved in front of her eyes . ( Cf . , " Them " . ) Sherwood's direction is strictly functional . If a group of six people is standing together , as in the last shot of the film , they don't huddle together . They stand in line and congratulate each other sideways , so that we can see them and all their faces at once in medium shot . And though the monsters make a lot of noise , crashing about through the canyons , they're not really as scary as , say , a giant tarantula would be , because they move so slowly . On top of that , they're insensible . They aren't alive , so they can't see anything or chase anything or eat anybody . The dialog seems to have been written in a hurry . Lola Albright : Dr . Higgins says that the girl has only eight hours . Maybe . Les Tremayne : And maybe - - not ? Albright : Maybe not . Yet , there is something unspeakably creepy about the sinuous colonies of black towers . The texture of the colony is revolting . It's like looking at a photo of a skin disease with pustule crowding against pustule . Yukk . And the fact that the rocks are mindless puts them in the category of things that can't be outwitted , like disease or death itself . It's a short , minor film , but I kind of enjoyed it . Despite the urgency , the tone of the movie is relaxed , as if nobody was really putting too much effort into it . And it's always fun to see the 1950s monster formula invoked for still another go .
I'll lend you mine if you lend me yours .	Two neighboring couples become friendly . One husband ( Spacey ) talks the other husband ( Klein ) into sneaking into each other's house one night and making love to the wives in the dark . Greater love hath no man than that he lay down his wife for a friend . Klein's wife ( Mastrantonio ) and Spacey's wife ( Miller ) will compliantly permit these goings on without realizing that the men on top of them or underneath or beside them are not , in fact , the proper husbands . Right away , you've got major plausibility problems . This sort of stuff is just fine in a Feydeau farce , but in a serious movie ? Anyhow , Spacey's wife apparently winds up with her head bashed in the next morning and Klein is blamed for the murder . Spacey , who has set Klein up , takes over Klein's family when Klein is subsequently arrested . Klein is out on bail pronto , though , so he can go about unraveling the plot . Forrest Whitaker is a private investigator working for an insurance company . He appears after the murder and we think , at last , Klein has someone who believes him and will help him . But , no . Whitaker shows up for one or two more brief conversations and nothing more is heard of him . I don't think I'll reveal any more of the plot for fear that if I did , news of such an indiscretion might reach the ears of someone in the National Security Agency , but I think it's safe to say that it all works out okay in the end , if under the definition of " okay " you're willing to include the bashing in of two innocent heads with a baseball bat , the jailing and ruin of an ordinary man , the near-destruction of a middle-class family , adultery , listening to country music , and other assorted mishigas . Hard to believe that Sidney Pollack directed this . It has none of his usual dash and most of the generic clichés . Nothing wrong with the performers . Rebecca Miller , especially , looks stunning and has incredible sky-blue eyes , almost as mind boggling as the plot . The most extraordinary thing about the film - - or the most revealing anyway - - is the location shooting . Every region of the country has its own distinctive architecture , usually from old models . I mean , like New York's brownstones , Baltimore's marble-stepped row houses , the shotgun houses of the rural South , the pastel stucco of San Francisco , and the unending variations of hot dogs , hats , and taj mahals of LA's restaurants . The Georgia shore has new housing too and it seems to be establishing its own regional presence . It's not urban though , it's suburban . If you see the movie you'll know what I mean . It reaches at least as far north as Cape Hatteras . A bit of regional subculture there . I didn't want to skip it because it's one of the movie's more interesting features , the story being what it is . I think that about sums it up for " Consenting Adults . " A pair of blue eyes you could dive into , and wooden frame houses , painted in dull primaries , with oddly shaped windows .
Unfinished Narrative .	The movie industry must be drawn to this story of the San Francisco Bay Area serial murderer like moths to a Klieg light and they always wind up irritated . The Zodiac narrative doesn't fit the required dramatic trajectory . Oh , the elements that have now become conventions are all there in the investigation - - the spooky killings , piecing the tesserae together into a mosaic with a pattern , the problem coordinating efforts between venues , the increasing number of incidents , the involvement of the press , the frustration of the police , the special investigative team , the obsessive pursuer , the red herrings , the " good " suspects who can't be pinned down - - but there is no climax ! What is SUPPOSED to happen is that the killer is identified and finally captured , preferably after a chase , and preferably after a shoot out if possible , then brought to justice . The last shot of the movie ought to show either ( 1 ) the vicious murderer smiling behind bars or ( 2 ) the lead detective finally able to sleep peacefully , undisturbed by nightmares . Not here . Multiple characters weave their way in and out of the story , so many that some of us may lose track of who's who . Mainly we can identify Robert Graysmith ( Jake Gyllenhaal ) , his wife ( Chloe Sevigny ) , reporter Paul Avery ( Robert Downey , Jr . ) . and Inspector Toschi ( Mark Ruffalo ) . We can identify them because they are familiar faces and because they show up on screen more often than others . And Jake Gyllenhaal is the especially perceptive cartoonist who is gradually swept up in the case , becomes possessed by it , and loses his family and his job in order to write the definitive book about it . I guess we remember Melvin Belli ( Bryan Cox ) too because he's so fluid . And we remember Arthur Leigh Allen ( John Carroll Lynch ) because he looks monumentally guilty . The story is all Gylenhaal's . He's the guy who cracks the code , does the leg work , amazes the police with his dedication , and virtually solves the case , though not to the satisfaction of the justice system . His chase , though ultimately fruitless , becomes frenzied . Well , it has to be the story of Graysmith and his sacrifices . He wrote the book the film is based on and he was technical adviser , along with his wife . If I were to be the adviser on a movie about MY life , my ex-wife would have had to leave because of my dedication to justice too , not because I kept a closet full of ladies ' shoes or something . ( No . ) But then , why did the investigation become so fast and sweaty towards the end ? The cops had long ago given up the case . Nothing was pending . There were no deadlines looming . The viewer senses chiefly that the pace must pick up speed because that's what the traditional narrative structure demands . The audience expects it . And , further , Graysmith must have found himself with a fascinating and commercial story that had no satisfactory ending , which is why Truman Capote was being driven nuts in the case of " In Cold Blood , " and delayed finishing the book until the killers were hanged . It isn't that there are no recurring treatments of unsolved murders . " Lizzie Borden took an ax , " etc . The Black Dahlia . And then there's Jack the Ripper . But the killers in these cases are safely dead , along with all the other real characters , and you can speculate about them as much as you like without fear of their taking legal redress . But with the Zodiac killer , who began his career in 1969 and , as far as we know , is still around , along with the victims and the agents of social control , conjecture has to be kept within the bounds of prudence . The result : an unfinished narrative , with everything left hanging in the air . It would have been nice if they'd caught the murderous , crowing lunatic . Not only would it have made a better book and better film , but he needs to suffer a little . As it stands , this movie provides us with all the details of the case we're likely to know . It's intelligently done . No exploding heads , no glitzy directorial displays , no lightning-fast editing . We're not likely to see a better description of the case on film .
In the Company of Moral Idiots	Who dreamed this thing up ? Somebody who had just come out of a theater having seen " Dangerous Liaisons " or " Valmont " and thought , hey , let's do something similar but make it more " socially relevant " , and without any of the sly wit of the original ? As it is , it's like watching Joan of Ark burn at the stake for an hour and a half . Two guys decide to get even with all the women who have hurt them by finding one innocent bystander , pretending to court her , then abruptly dumping her . One of the guys , Chad , is the instigator - - clean-looking , smooth , a moral idiot - - who succeeds in dethroning his friend , bedding the victim , and winds up happily ever after lying back on his bed , staring at the ceiling , and wearing a big smirk as his girl friend goes down on him like some Yemeni hooker . The other guy is something of a schmuck , looks a bit like Tommy Dorsey , and goes along with the gag at first . Then he finds that he is actually falling for the victim and tells her the truth about the game being played on her , handling the whole nasty business very badly . I mean , when you're giving someone the bad news like that , it's generally not a good idea to grab her by the shoulders and shake her vigorously back and forth while screaming at her , " Can't you understand ? Are you stupid ? " Stacey Edwards as the girl is not at all dumb but she is deaf . And innocent and helpless . And when the two guys begin hitting on her at the same time and one of them plays " hurt , " she blames herself for it . ( My kind of woman ; where do you find them ? ) She's attractive too , and is able to generate just enough of the sort of voice that hearing-challenged people use as to be believable yet comprehensible . Her head darts birdlike from side to side as she tries to follow a speaker's lips so she can read them . At the end , Tommy Dorsey comes back to her and begins to shout at her again because he's still in love with her - - " Listen ! " But from her point of view , all we see is some unprepossessing little guy flapping his mouth in silence . The oily , bitter guy , Chad , by the way , is really a no-goodnik of the first order . Once he has displaced his friend and assumed charge of the project he calls in a black guy for an interview for a possible promotion , and humiliates him by making him drop his pants and reveal what kind of testicles he's got . Well , it's ridiculous , sure . That's where any normal job interviewee would say , " This interview ends right now , " and would walk out the door . But the whole low-budgeted talky film is ridiculous . Men and women don't act this way . Oh , some women may act as gracefully as Stacey Edwards does here ; and some guys may be as dumb as Tommy Dorsey . But anybody of either sex acting like Chad would be found out quickly enough for the psychopath he or she is . It's unrealistic in another sense . I'm not sure any human being would flay a hearing-challenged person with such venom . You'd have to comb the ridges . And although if he's handsome , like Chad , and a convincing enough liar he might have a plenitude of girls around him , he would have no depth on the bench in the way of friends or job prospects . The movie is unpleasant from start to finish . These two guys aren't as physically brutal as Richard III but they're not nearly as interesting either .
Engaging study of informal norms . .	SPOILERS . The title has a double meaning . Nicholson is an agent of the border patrol who moves from California to El Paso . He and his wife begin hanging with Harvey Keitel and his wife , also a border patrol family . The women are complete airheads . ( I'm trying to keep this summary brief . ) Nicholson and his wife , Valerie Perrine , move into their new house , a monstrously unimaginative tract home , and she overspends on an expensive new water bed , a swimming pool . They argue over the fact that she's spending all their money and more , and Perrine breaks down and weeps . claiming she's only doing it for him , after offering him his choice of frozen dinners - - regular or " Hungry Man . " ( He replies dejectedly , " Hungry Man . " ) Before long , Keitel begins testing Nicholson to see if he's up for smuggling some illegal labor into the country from Mexico . ( Nobody in this movie is a genius , but at least Keitel doesn't suggest doing it the other way around . ) Nicholson , due to financial pressure , agrees to allow some of the wetbacks to get through . Elpidia Carillo , a beautiful young mother , is one of them . Alas , a glitch occurs and she winds up in jail where someone steals her baby , worth $25K to rich white Americans . Keitel is also responsible , it seems , for one or two murders along the way , which enrages Nicholson who draws a line in the sand avant la lettre and shouts at Keitel - - " You see this line ? That's as far as I go ! NO MURDERS ! " " Okay , " replies Keitel smoothly , " I can respect that . " Well , Nicholson rescues the baby and sees to it that all the bad guys are dead . So far , so routine . What's new about this crime / action movie ? Well , there are some things in fact . First of all there's a rather neat musical score built around solo guitar , contributed by , among others , Ry Cooder . Next , the photography is good . The unpaved back roads with Border Patrol vans bouncing from side to side and raising clouds of dust . The polluted trickle of murky water , brimming with garbage and discarded tires , that is the Rio Grande . The constant sun of summer . And the art director did splendidly too . That new white-brick ranch house Nicholson and Perrine move into is so depressingly ordinary . And once across the border into what must be Juarez but looks like the kind of red light district that used to be called " Boy's Town " outside of Tijuana , or " Cherry Hill " outside of Villa ( now Ciudad ) Acuna , a neon-lit , shadowy place filled with noise , poverty , whoring , dope , treachery and blood . Nicholson gets himself clobbered here while trying to rescue Carillo from a fate worse than death . She's an interesting actress , by the way , with a wide pretty face , the spindly calves of a Yaqui Indian , at least minimal acting talent , a graceful carriage , and an appealing on-screen presence . No wonder that during a moment of high tension Nicholson's wife shouts at him , " What exactly IS your relationship with her ? " The script may be more or less by the book , but the director and editor make no mistakes with it . There is an exciting scene in which the Border Patrol vans are in pursuit of an old truck carrying illegals . Banging around corners and bouncing over ruts at high speed . The director gives us one brief shot of the horrific beating the aliens are taking inside the locked truck . Finally the truck gives a final acrobatic leap and lands on its side in a ditch . The director wisely holds on the shot of the upended truck , with dust settling around it , although it must have been tempting to show us the shrieking aliens slamming against the walls and against each other . But he doesn't do it because it's not necessary . We can imagine the " Typhoon " - like horror the trapped " backs " have gone through . Both Nicholson and Keitel turn in fine performances , as one would expect . Neither of them has any scenes in which they make the viewer's hair stand on end , but the story doesn't give them much of a chance to stretch . This isn't high tragedy . It's an ordinary tale of how informal norms develop within a highly structured bureaucratic system . The rules are organized so as to cover every possible contingency , but as anyone knows who has tried to do things " by the book , " they are impossible to follow to the letter . Everything would grind to a halt and the agency would never achieve its goals . Corners are inevitably cut , rounded off so to speak , and niceties overlooked in order to get the job done . This movie explores the issue of just how far personnel can go in getting things done while still preserving their sanity . How many rules is one allowed to break before that expediency turns immoral ? Not that there aren't weaknesses that anchor this film firmly to the level of the routine . The bad guy , J . J . , at the " drop point " is not just breaking the law . He's positively evil . He taunts Nicholson at their first meeting by suggesting Nicholson's mother was likely a whore that he , the bad guy , tangoed with in San Diego , then pulls a piece on Nicholson and says , " Just a push , son , just a push . " There's no motivation involved here . The point is simply to rob the bad guy of any touch of humanity so that when his head is blown off at the end we feel only satisfaction . It's a push , but a rather cheap touch . Still , overall , this is an enjoyable movie . No romance , although there is domestic comedy , a solid middlebrow script , just enough action , and good performances . You'll probably not kick yourself for having watched it .
There have been worse .	I have to say that I dozed off a bit during the 9 songs recorded live at a concert because , with one exception , a simple piano solo , it is just not my kind of music anymore . I don't mean that the music is poor , only that I can't tell whether it's any good or not . About half the movie is shot at a concert . The other half sketches in a brief relationship between a Londoner and a visiting American student . The episodes involving the couple are little slices of life with many fades to black , many cuts that seem arbitrary , and some visual and narrative allusions to Antarctica , the significance of which escapes me . Unless , and I hate to suggest this , the significance is unthinkably banal : humans are emotionally frigid and driven by natural forces , like icebergs . The Londoner ( O'Brian ) seems like a nice-enough ordinary guy . The young woman ( Stilly ) is drawn from the ranks of models and has features that are plainly attractive , on the cusp of really attractive , and her figure is flawless . You can't get past mentioning her figure because the viewer gets to see so much of it . That may not be unusual these days , but seeing erections , explicit oral sex , emissions , and actual intercourse in a mainstream movie is a rarity . There simply isn't that much male nudity around . That's okay with me . I don't care one way or the other , but this goes far beyond a glimpse of O'Brian's schlong and reaches a point at which we can tell that O'Brian is definitely not Jewish . The couple don't do much in their episodes except make love and talk about it in street language . ( There is some exchange involving her taking pills too early in the morning but it does not amount to an argument . ) Sex isn't so much explored as it is displayed . She puts off committee meetings so they can get it on . He performs cunnilingus , seeming to plunge into her from above , like a diver in search of abalone . He blindfolds her and ties her willing hands to the bed while he goes down on her . She ties HIM to the bed and steps on his chest with high-heeled boots . Stilly may be acting . You can never tell with women ! But O'Brian , although he obviously must know he's on camera , must have studied with Stanislavski . The two of them together constitute a sexual dynamo . When Stilly is not on or under O'Brian she is using a little buzzing toy . O'Brian seems to have a nervous system whose neurons lack any refractory period . She may be voracious but he is a medical miracle . Although nothing much happens , I didn't find the movie either particularly dull or at all pornographic . The romantic interludes were erotic but might have been more so if we'd known more about the two people we're spying on . Okay . She's a student . But what is she studying ? And where ? And what drew her to her subject ? He seems to work in a geological research lab , but does he like his work ? Does he have a family ? How do they feel about leaving each other ? Anyone's guess is as good as anyone else's , and that's a kind of weakness because if you want to do nothing more than watch two strangers copulate for money you can get that in any skin flick . And ultimately , in every way , this movie is an improvement over that .
A Fool for Love	Audrey Totter is splashed all over the ads for this movie , so I naturally worried it would be the story of a woman in jeopardy . You know the kind . Nice rich girl is swept off her feat and marries a dark and handsome man of mystery but he's really a cad who is out for her money and she finds out he's planning to kill her but when he creeps into her bedroom with the claw hammer she slips away from him but tonight of all nights the door is locked and if the cops hadn't busted in because of that pesky neighbor why who knows what would have happened . It's not that , though . It's a pretty clever little crime drama involving intrigue and even mystery . Richard Basehart is convincing as Warren Quimby or Phineas Quimby or whatever his first name is . ( It's the last that counts - - " Quimby " - - because it tells us all we need to know about him . ) He's a pharmacist desperately , even masochistically , in love with his wife , Audrey Totter , who treats him with contempt , sees other men whenever she feels like it , and finally runs off to Malibu with one of them , the heathen slut . Boy , does this brown Basehart off ! He plans to kill the big brute she's living with by adopting a different identity , so he establishes a second residence under the name of Paul Southern and trades his wimpy eyeglasses in for a pair of contacts . ( They must have been new at the time because they get quite a bit of attention . ) He also strikes up a friendship with his new neighbor , Cyd Charisse , and they fall for each other . So , as planned , Basehart hitches out to Malibu and is about to kill the man who is cuckolding him but thinks better of it . Just before doing the deed , he realizes that , hey , his wife is pretty smarmy after all and this big lug can keep her . Basehart walks away into the night . But all is not over . Next day the big brute's body is found with a . 38 slug in it and the cops ( Barry Sullivan and William Conrad ) track down Phineas Quimby and " Paul Southern " and arrest him as the chief suspect in the murder . The right of legal privilege prevents me from any further disclosure of the plot points . The film is inexpensive . No big bankable stars . No big chases , no shoot outs . But it's engaging . In the course of his career , Richard Basehart played a range of characters , from menacing murderers to = = well , to sneaky murderers , I guess , but he always came across to me as a nice guy from Ohio who was playing the heavy . The director , John Berry , should have reined Audrey Totter in . She only uses two expressions : a treacherous seductive smile and a contemptuous sneer . It would have been far better if her overacting hadn't underlined what the character's behavior is already telling us . What kind of noir would " Double Indemnity " have been if Phyllis Dietrichson had let us know from the very beginning that she was nothing more than a rotten , lying , exploitative murdering witch ? Cyd Charisse is a beautiful and talented woman , but a an actress of modest talent , and Sydney , the hair stylist , has Guilaroffed her into something resembling Francis Coppola's Dracula . Really weird . But it doesn't disguise her beauty . It's impossible to make Cyd Charisse look bad . She STILL looked elegant fifty years after " The Bandwagon . " Barry Sullivan gives a cool performance as the Lieutenant from Homicide . The writers are partly responsible , as they are for some of the other nifty little things about the movie . The title , " Tension " , is based on Sullivan's introductory spiel , during which he plays with an over-sized rubber band , illustrating how he builds up the eponymous tension in his suspects . He plays with the elastic band on and off throughout , at one point using playfully as a slingshot . Another instance of the writers ' facility : Basehart , behind bars , is repeating his alibi for the night of the murder . Sullivan and Conrad are listening , and Conrad is eating a jelly doughnut . " Why don't you tell us the truth ? " , snarls Conrad . " You're beginning to sound like a phonograph record with the needle stuck in the groove . " And later , when Basehart desperately begins to go over the same ground , Conrad closes his eyes and moves the half-eaten doughnut round and round . By the way , there's a scene in which Basehart calls his intended victim and disguises his voice by holding a handkerchief over the receiver . It does not work . I know because I tried it . I called my home phone using a handkerchief and left a threatening message on my answering machine . When I got home , I played the tape . At first I was a little concerned , wondering whom I could have offended , but on a second playing I was able to correctly guess the identity of the caller ( me ) and in no time at all I figured out that the message wasn't meant seriously . It's not a challenging movie and it doesn't purport to be artistic . It's a well-groomed and enjoyable Hollywood product .
Poirot at Work .	Considerable fun can be had at the expense of the big super-duper Hollywood productions of Agatha Christie's Poirot stories from the 1970s . COLOSSAL STUPENDOUS STAR-STUDDED CAST ! and all that . Yet , after watching a few of these very well-done British TV episodes , I'm beginning to wonder if it doesn't help to see Famous Faces in the subordinate roles . At least a viewer can keep the character apart . A horde of strange faces is always confusing , either on the screen or on the subway . In this instance , " After the Funeral , " the writers haven't given us much chance . The nervous voice-over of the family solicitor introduces us to more than half a dozen characters , or should I say " suspects " , without giving them more than a minute's worth of presentation . Very rude . And the curious and mysterious events follow very quickly too , in piles , heaped on one another , beginning with the cremation of the family patriarch . ( " Very odd for an English gentleman , n'est pas ? " ) A will is read , but it turns out to be false . Then another will appears . And a false letter from the patriarch . And all sorts of facts , many or most of them red herrings , are hidden from the viewer . Confusion leads to still more confusion . I DID fully understand the ritual exposition at the end , when Poirot has gathered all the relevant faces , most of them still a little strange , in the parlor and explains all . Yet , the story itself , twisted and anfractuous as it is , isn't up to Agatha Christie's best . There are too MANY red herrings . And Poirot needs a sidekick to talk things over with . I mean , Holmes had Watson . Charlie Chan had Number One Son . I guess Columbo didn't have a sidekick . He was his own sidekick . These stories would move along a clearer path if there were scenes like those after the murder on the Orient Express . ( I'm talking about the STAR-STUDDED STUPENDOUS MOVIE , not the novel . ) In it , Poirot and his sidekick interview each suspect or set of suspects at some length . And even before that , we've gotten to know their characters so we have a good idea of who's who , if not what's what . This kind of formal exposition isn't essential . Some of the better examples of the TV series didn't have them either - - " Death on the Nile " or " Murder in Mesopotamia " - - but in those cases the suspects were still well differentiated and I never felt overwhelmed by their sheer volume . Imagine if this story had been squeezed from 95 minutes into 50 ! Hand me my headache powder , please !
Let us now praise Blanchett .	A widow with ESP ( Cate Blanchett ) lives with her son in a small Southern town , helping people by trying to " read " their futures and living on donations . There are folks who don't like that kind of devlish stuff ' round here . Katie disappears . Blanchett , who is one of those psychics who cannot control their " visions " so that she can only get glimpses of things that have happened or might happen , has a vision of Holmes ' body at the bottom of a pond . She reveals her vision to the Sheriff ( good performance by Dr . Emil Skoda , I mean J . K . Simmons ) . Well , he's one of the local empiricists and doesn't believe her but takes her out to a pond resembling the one seen in her vision . Sure enough . They drag Katie's remains out of it . Where was Tom Cruise when she needed him ? I won't go on with the plot . It gets twisted around a bit and the end won't come as a great big surprise if you've seen a couple of other thrillers with metaphysical overtones . It was written by the co-authors of the far superior , " One False Move . " But this is a pretty weak effort . We hear New Age lines from a bunch of small-minded townies . A man and a woman are attracted to one another but when he comes on to her , she backs hesitantly away and says , " I don't think this is a good idea right now . " ( The guy is falling-down drunk so it's hard to see what the idea was in the first place . ) " She's gone , " the man tells the woman , " but I have to learn to live with that , just as you have to learn to live with the loss of your husband . " ( Real MEN don't talk like that . ) And , later , " I'm so sorry I wasn't there for you when you needed me . " The director , Raimi , is efficient without being in the least original . The music cues us about looming threats . When Blanchett is worried , a shadow crosses her curtain - - but it turns out to be a friend ! As the climax approaching , to heighten the tension , there is a windy thunderstorm full of rain and strobe lightning . ( Ho hum . ) At the end , when all is being revealed , the rain is replaced by fog . One blow from a flashlight conks a full-grown man out for the duration just because the script calls for it . Blanchett is about to be murderized at the pond but she is saved by a disturbed young man whom she had earlier tried to help . The young man , Giovanni Ribisi , is supposed to be in a psychiatric hospital but , " I escaped , " he tells her . He doesn't tell her how he managed to find her and her would-be murderer in the middle of the woods in the middle of the night in the fog . Well , not that it matters , because it turns out that Ribisi has actually been dead for a couple of hours anyway . This takes us beyond the possibility of ESP and into the realm of the frankly supernatural . This raises certain interesting questions but the film doesn't address them . It's satisfied to be another everyday thriller with parallel universe harmonics . All of that makes it sound like a movie to avoid but it's not . The reason it's not is that mysteries are kind of interesting . Whodunnit , you know ? And the movie is saved by Cate Blanchett's sterling performance . She makes the movie . She isn't exactly beautiful . She's lean and narrow shouldered . Her nose is long and pulpy , and her epicanthic fold is overdeveloped by Western tastes . But faces have characteristics or traits . Angelina Jolie's primary trait is sexuality . Gene Tierney's was staggering beauty . Agnes Moorehead's was sliminess of a particularly feminine sort . Blanchett's primary trait is perceptivity . Not intelligence in any academic sense , but an ability to figure things out , to see through them , to discern patterns and form Gestalts . This trait is put to good use , of course , in a role that calls for psychic abilities , but she showed the same ability to use her skills in " Elizabeth " too , where instead of hesitancy and anxiety the role called for a growing self confidence . Her accent alone is fascinating . Her Commonwealth speech is quite thoroughly transformed into Southernness here . It's not the hillbilly speech of the upland South , and it's not from the low country either . Its closest analog is probably Texas or Oklahoma . She has even the slightest of marks down right . " I didn't really think anything OF it . " And the vowel is prolonged and drawn out in a manner only found in the American South . ( The same speech sound is heard in the vowel in " druuuunk . " ) Sorry . Bit of regional linguistics there . Oh - - I ought to mention wardrobe too . A fine job . They've given Blanchett exactly the right unpretentious floppy clothes that an ordinary lower-middle-class Southern widow of no sophistication might wear . Example : In one important scene , she wears this fuzzy white V-necked sweater - - angora or cashmere or something . ( I don't know anything about women's clothes but I know what I like . ) Underneath this sweater , though , there is a rough white T shirt that leaves a cartoon alligator's face peeping over the sweater's V neck . Exactly the proper degree of sloppiness . Yet in another scene , at a party , her hair is draped around her long face is lustrous curls and when she reaches down to remove a tight shoe we can't help noticing how sleek her ankle and her feet are , and neither can Kinnear , the guy she's with . But without Cate Blanchett's superior performance this would be no more than a routine thriller . With her , it rises rather above the routine and is worth catching .
Successful , Machine-Processed Action Movie .	I'm going to give it a 6 partly because it was shot in Paris , Nice , and Arles . It gives you a tourist's eye view of France in the winter , including a chilly , overcast Riviera and Van Gogh's Yellow House , morphed into what looks like an overpriced café . Other than that , this is an action movie stripped down to the bare bones . The characters are as rudimentary as the plot . A handful of unemployed professionals are hired by Natascha McIlhone ( representing the Irish ) to ambush a convoy of cars transporting a curious-looking case , the contents of which have been sold to the Russians . I think I've got that right . If I haven't , it doesn't matter . The conspicuously aluminum case is an operational definition of a MacGuffin . What's in it ? Who knows and who cares ? The whole movie is built around its action sequences and they are plentiful . There is a meeting between the professionals and the French gangsters who are to supply them with equipment for the heist . It turns into a shoot out . The convoy is intercepted and it turns into a car chase . It ends in a shoot out , during which one of the professionals , Gregor , turns into a cockroach . There's another car chase through tunnels and whatnot that destroys so many vehicles it surely would have cleared even the Parisian streets of traffic . The end involves a couple of murders . Even Katarina Witt gets it , which is a dirty trick . Novelties ? Not too many . Well , I suppose that in the course of these pursuits and battles , it's a novelty to see innocent bystanders get plowed down or shot up or blown up . The zipping cars smash through the usual food stands and push carts but I don't remember their ever doing it on such narrow streets . There isn't any noticeable development of character . That is , nobody changes in any fundamental way . Michael Lonsdale , as a rich old man , and Stellan Skarsgard , as Gregor the dung beetle , give the best performances . Rober DeNiro , a fine actor , seems out of place in all this European company . Natascha McIlhone has a somber , angular , and sexy face but I wouldn't trust her as far as I could throw her , which isn't very far . I like Jean Reno best of all . Regard that face , that voice ! The guy looks like he's coming down from a week-long bout with the bottle . There aren't that many international movie stars at whom I can look without saying to myself , " I wish I were that handsome . " Aside from bullets and baggage , what is the movie about ? It seems to be about itself . There's nothing much behind what you see . It's like buying " roast beef " at a modern deli . Roast beef , my foot . It's machine-processed beef , scraped right down to the bone , then pureed and solidified and seasoned so that it looks a little - - just a little - - like what it purports to be . There's some phony philosophy from Michael Lonsdale's sage , who tells DeNiro the story of the forty-seven ronin - - who planned and waited for years for an opportunity to avenge their betrayed master - - but it has nothing to do with the movie . Lonsdale's thoughtfully delivered lesson might as well have been the Gilgamesh epic , or Huckleberry Finn , for that matter . It's an attempt to coat the plot with some portentous uber-meaning , but that just makes it the same processed stuff under a thin , negligible shell of pastry , like Beef Wellington . I've made this sound like a pretty crummy movie but it's not , if you like action movies . The director knows exactly what he's doing . The editing is superb , as it has to be to make this genre piece a success . The shootouts , collisions , and deaths are in real time , not slow motion . It may not be pregnant with meaning but it's diverting , exciting , and not insulting to the viewer who's willing to shrug and say , " For an action movie , this one isn't too bad . "
Williams is funny but movie devolves .	Robin Williams , a TV satirist , runs for president as a joke and because of a glitch in the electronic voting machines , he wins . Everyone is stunned . Williams ' manager , Christopher Walken is stunned , partly because the percentage he will take of Williams ' presidential salary is so much smaller than what he was getting when Williams was a monumentally successful comedian . Laura Linney is stunned when she discovers that the voting machines developed some kind of complicated glitch based on the double letters in the names of candidates like Mills , Kellogg , and Dobbs and elected Dobbs ( Williams ) by mistake . Jeff Goldblum as the head of Delacroy , the company that manufactured and programmed the voting machines , is more aptly described as concerned than stunned . When Linney discovers the error and wants to correct the election results , Goldblum sets out to correct Linney . The programming error had to be inadvertent because the movie isn't ballsy enough to suggest anything else . Williams comes up with his usual gags , most of them successful . He wants " freedom of religion " , where a person can be Buddhish , part Buddhist and part Jewish , so they can sit and wait for the item to go on sale . He's the best part of the movie , wearing his phony George Washington costume to Congress and complaining that his buckled shoes confused him . He couldn't decide whether he was a Pilgrim or a pimp . Next laurels should go to Christopher Walken as the practical , cynical show-biz manager . When it is revealed that his client's election was a fraud , he shrugs . So what ? The whole thing is a fraud anyway . ( His character's name is Mencken . ) Linney is given a chance to stretch her chops in a breakdown scene in a Starbucks , after she's been mugged and pumped full of every drug under the sun by Goldblum's agents in an attempt to discredit her before she squeals . ( Lord help Delacroy stock if the word gets out . ) She drops her coffee cup , gets paranoid and accuses strangers of going through her purse , and is carted away in an ambulance . Her performance was , I thought , brimming with verisimilitude , reminding me so much , as it did , of an ex girl friend . He handles the dramatic scenes as well as anyone could . The problem is that the dramatic scenes stink . The second half has Laura Linney running from place to place , pursued by Goldblum's Goons , and trying to reach Williams and convince him that his election was a mistake . Here you will find every cliché in the book . Linney doesn't know she's being watched by a heavy from a parked car as she runs to a phone booth out in the middle of nowhere and frantically phones Williams . Guess whether the car revves up and smashes through the isolated phone booth . When Linney finally reaches Williams on their cell phones , he's on his way to an airport to catch a plane and she only has a few minutes to convey her important information about the computer problem . The script causes her to do what every character with an important message must do under these conditions . She goes to pieces , tries to explain the mechanics of the glitch , falls all over herself , and produces what might charitably be called word salad . " You need help , " Williams tells her sadly . There are car pursuits , phone taps , everything you'd expect from a Grade B thriller . Too bad . The movie could have gone in the direction of " Primary Colors , " mixing comedy and realism . It might have gone in the direction of " The Parallax View , " with a deliberate sabotage of the voting system . But it does neither . I can't imagine its offending anyone . It has no politics whatever , as far as that goes . Williams is an Independent candidate who is " for " freedom of religion , improving the educational system ( " half the kids think that Joan of Arc was Noah's wife " - - he thinks he's kidding ? ) , health care , world peace , ridding the capitol of special interests , addressing environmental issues , making it easier to extract DVDs from their cases , and - - yawn . I wish someone would harness Williams ' talent more effectively . The guy is brilliant in his own unquiet way . He can do drama as well as comedy ( " Insomnia " ) , but he's made some mighty purple script choices . " Patch Adams " anyone ? At any rate I'm glad he wasn't elected . We've had enough clowns in the White House lately . We don't need any more . What we need now is some kind of civil engineer who can build something out of the rubble .
Sad , Involving Story of Sports Hero .	The movie itself isn't outstanding in any way . Michael Curtiz , the director , keeps the bodies in motion and wastes no time on pretentious touches . Burt Lancaster is solid without rising above the rather banal script , in which Jim Thorpe , a Sac and Fox Indian , starts out an impoverished kid on the reservation , rises to athletic stardom at Carlisle Indian School , goes on to win a bunch of hard-earned medals at the 1912 Olympics ( in which George C . Patton was a member of the boxing team ) , marries the girl he's always loved , has a child on whom he dotes as the reincarnation of his self , and then - - one by one - - loses it all . One can hardly blame him for his downward slide . His Olympic ( or Olympian ) feats are nullified because he played baseball for money during a summer vacation from Carlisle . Along with them goes the coaching job he's been hoping for . His beloved son dies later . His bitterness drives away his wife - - for good . He soldiers on , playing professional football , but for less prestigious teams and lower salaries . Like the rest of us , as he grows older he loses his stamina until he can't find any work in sports . He plays host at a marathon dance in the 1930s dressed as a cigar-store Indian . He alienates his few remaining friends , including his college coach , Pop Warner ( Charles Bickford ) , who gave him his start . Finally , he drives a truck over a football belonging to a gang of kids , gives them a new football and teaches them the elements of the sport . " Gee , thanks , Coach , " says one of the kids . A broad smile spreads across Lancaster's face when he's so addressed and he - - in the words of Pop Warner - - " finds himself . " The final scene has him being honored at a vast reception , looking gray at the temples , neatly dressed , grateful and distinguished . The applause deafens the listener . It's something of a cop out , that ending . Not just because the real Thorpe never managed to climb out of one of the lower socioeconomic classes , but because it panders to an audience that wants a typical Hollywood happy ending , or at least an ending ambiguous enough to suggest ultimate redemption , like " Young Man With a Horn , " about a Bix Beiderbeck character . Hardly any mention is made of alcohol . The ending makes no sense . How does an individual " find himself . " What does it MEAN ? It's like saying that someone " got in touch with his feelings . " And after having been a winner in grueling competitions like the Pentathlon and the Decathlon and having become world famous , meeting with the King of Sweden , and relishing it , are you really saved if a handful of raggedy slum kids call you " Coach " and run away after you kick their new football in their direction ? Thorpe became a big , shambling wreck and picked up a few bit parts in Hollywood movies . If you want to see what he was like in the late 1940s , watch the scene in John Ford's " Wagonmaster " in which the LDS members dance in a circle with the Indians , and Ward Bond looks up with awe at the giant next to him . The soft landing notwithstanding , it's an exciting movie , and an exhilarating one . Great to see Burt Lancaster in the track and field events . ( He didn't play football and wasn't much at baseball . ) Lancaster was as fit as a fiddle . He kept himself in shape through regular exercise and practice . He never lifted weights so he was sinuous rather than muscle-bound like some screen narcissists . Being a hero is a tough row to hoe , or at least I would imagine . Not only is it tough being an athlete , but it raises the question of what you do for an encore . Like ex-presidents , ex-athletes must have a difficult time dealing with the discrepancy between what they once were and what they now are . Perhaps wisely , this movie focuses mainly on what Jim Thorpe was , and gives us a foolish ending so that we can walk away from the film feeling all warm inside . To treat Thorpe's later career seriously would involve a very different kind of movie .
One Nunnery You Should Not Get Thee To .	An object lesson in how to make the most out of some thin material . The photography by Jack Cardiff is superb and so are the sets by Alfred Junge . What locations ! The rugged Himalayas , a deserted monastery that a handful of proper English women is determined to turn into a nunnery , saw-toothed mountain tops , giant and snow-veined , crystalline air , the wind moaning in the background through the vast halls , billowing drapery , a Top of the World that Cody Jarett never dreamed of ! Stupendous atmosphere . And the direction is above the clouds too . Powell and Pressburger construct a story that is leisurely and wondrous at first . The nuns are all in white . The local are in exotic dress . Everyone is bubbly and bright and living in a fairy tale , until it turns into a Grimm fairy tale . You see , each of the nuns is haunted by personal demons , as indeed all of us are . But when you're stuck up there on the rooftop of the world and there's only one guy around , David Farrar , and he insists on stalking around FIXING THE PLUMBING , and wearing shorts and sometimes no shirt at all so the starving women are exposed to his bare , slightly hairy chest - - well . The camera work is so fluid , so swooping , and the direction so professional that the soap-opera aspects of the film are almost unnoticeable . And it does seem rather like a romantic drama more than a story of spiritual evolution . Powell and Pressburger are given to shocking jump cuts and unexpected close ups - - long before close ups became commonplace . We see huge images . Not only of faces but of particular features , especially eyes although there are one or two shots of lips being painted . ( That's the word - - painted . ) These faces are important because they're about all we get to see of the women . Their costumes are identical . Deborah Kerr is just about perfect as the Mother Superior or Top Sergeant or whatever her title is . Her beauty is fresh-faced . She's slightly wall eyed . Her voice is tremulous and girlish . Everything about her face and demeanor suggests innocence , though she shows strength enough when the situation demands it . All of the nuns are disturbed in one way or another , but Kathleen Byron goes frankly mad . She believes that Farrar desires her as much as she lusts after him , and that the other nuns , especially Kerr , know this and are jealous of her . Paranoia with features of erotomania . The most startling moment in the film is when Kerr bursts into Byron's dark room and finds her out of her habit and dressed in sensual civilian clothes , her hair done with abandon , her face fully made up . The shot uses a kick light so Byron's face is lighted from below and takes on a character that is sexy , dangerous , and almost demonic . A lavish display of visual delights , and good performances and direction .
The MGM Version is Marginally Better .	Everyone knows the basic story . Basil Hallward ( Jeremy Brett ) paints a portrait of young Dorian Gray ( Peter Firth ) that perfectly captures his innocence and beauty . Lord Henry ( Sir John Gielgud ) is entranced by both the portrait and the model . He more or less woos Dorian Gray and corrupts him with his cynicism . Gray begins to treat people heartlessly in his selfish search for sensation , beginning with his rejection of the actress he was in love with ( Judi Bowker ) because , being distracted by Gray's presence in the theater , she gave a poor performance as Juliet . She kills herself but Gray is unmoved . In the end , the butler discovers Gray , dead apparently by his own hand , shriveled and ugly , as wicked-looking as his portrait has become over the years . The performances aren't bad , and neither is the script . ( Adaptation by John Osborne . ) But it's a filmed play , after all , and it looks like one . Peter Firth doesn't look particularly unsullied to me at the start , or especially handsome either . In the MGM film , Hurd Hatfield wasn't especially attractive either but he DID look like he was ready to be thoroughly debauched . And George Sanders in 1945 was the equal of John Gielgud here , slinging around those Wilde aphorisms . The early film , sadly , had been cleaned up by MGM to promote domestic consumption , I suppose , so some anti-Americanisms and anti-feminist barbs were deleted . " America has never actually been ' discovered , ' merely ' detected ' . " And " When good Americans die they go to Paris . When bad Americans die they go - - to America . " Both the play and the novel had a little trouble depicting Gray's descent into the obscene . In the novel , Gray engages in such morally corrupt enterprises as examining rare stones , viewing barbaric paintings , and fondling fabrics . It's doubtful that a Victorian audience would have approved of what Gray was really up to , namely hanging around and having love affairs with both sexes . The MGM version couldn't deal with it either , but this play makes the homoeroticism about as explicit as it can . Basil the artist is clearly jealous of Sir John . The men talk of " loving " one another . And in the penultimate scene , Gielgud is awed by Gray's perpetual beauty and kneels to kiss his hand , a gesture Firth rejects with contempt . Sir John's witticisms come thick and fast and they're always amusing but I found this version a little static and was disappointed . The 1945 movie had its flaws but the production values were higher and it showed .
In the Beginning , There Was the Cellulose . . . . .	This wouldn't be much more than a routine early comedy except for its historical interest . I mean , a John Ford talkie , the debuts of Spencer Tracy and Humphrey Bogart . Tracy and Warren Hyman , two roughnecks , break out of prison , meet again in Kansas City , get into a fist fight in public , wind up back in the slams again . Here they meet Humphrey Bogart , a nice kid from a good family who is taking the rap for someone else . Bogart meets a pretty blond inmate from the women's section , a victime of a frame , and they fall for each other . Bogart is released and goes home to wait for his girl to be sprung . ( His family thinks he's been in China . ) But the dirty rat for whom the blond took the fall shows up and threatens to expose Bogart unless he pimps some phony stocks . Bogart is in a quandary . Hearing of this , Tracy and Hyman break out again and visit Bogart's home in New England . After they straighten things out , they cheerfully go back to the prison in time for the big baseball game . Bogart is unexceptional in his one-dimensional role . Tracy is rather a fuller character . Both were to have distinguished careers but in this early film Bogart seemed to be still learning his craft while Tracy was already what he would be later . Warren Hymer is stuck in the role of the dummy and is the source of much of what humor there is . When he and Tracy are first invited into Bogart's upper-class home for dinner , they meet Bogart's family and Tracy is self-conscious . Hymer , though , is swept up into the prevailing decorum and rushes to help Bogart's mother into her chair , while Tracy gawks in silence . And when Hymer completes Mom's saying grace , Tracy drops his spoon in amazement . There are minor Fordian touches . Before a game , the manager explains to the visiting team of prisoners that certain actions are not allowed - - and he demonstrates each of them on the team . ( Cf . , " Rio Grande . " ) The inmates put on a show and one of them sings the sentimental ditty " Mother . " ( " M is for the million things she gave me . . . " ) And Ford pans slowly across the faces of the audience as they tear up . And he seems to be serious . But , overall , the story is nothing to write home about and one gets a sense that , Tracy aside , the chief elements were yet to hit their stride . It's not a bad movie . It's just nothing special .
Sketched from a forgotten war .	Sam Fuller , the director , could sometimes give interviews that were as interesting as his movies . No baloney , and his cynicism was up front and cheerful . He'd been a Chicago newspaperman , straight out of " The Front Page " , and there is a photo of him leaning back in his chair , feet propped on the desk , a cigar in his mouth , his fedora tilted back with a " press " card in its band . A kind of caricature of a hard-boiled reporter , almost a cartoon . That , for some reason , is how many of his war films strike us today - - as cartoons rather than reality - - and " Fixed Bayonets " isn't an exception . I know the story is from a novel but it might as well have been a comic book with stereotyped soldiers uttering sentences short enough to fit into dialog balloons above their heads . Don't know why . Fuller was in the First Infantry Division during the war , the Big Red One , already in his mid-30s , and he never got over it . Years later , when the war was all over , when Fuller was safely back home , he could tell interviewers that he couldn't even listen to a noise like this ( and here , he'd rap his knuckles lightly against a wooden surface ) without leaping to his feet . The guy had been through hell . One of his fellow sufferers was nicknamed Griff , and there is a character named " Griff " , sometimes unseen , in most of his movies . " Fixed Bayonets " is the story of a platoon picked to provide a rear guard while the rest of the regiment retreats . Their mission is to engage any communists in pursuit and try to convince them that the entire regiment is present at this last ditch stand . The central figure is a lowly corporal ( Richard Basehart ) who is both brave and intelligent but who cannot bring himself to kill another man or to order someone else to do it . Three men are above him in the chain of command . You can guess what happens to them . There's nothing much to be said about the performances . The lines being so rudimentary , there is hardly any performance to be given . " I'll get you back alive , Sarge . " " Hey ! Watch it . That's an open wound ! " Richard Basehart is at least believable as the unfortunate corporal . He's never been a bravura actor and that slight , stiff reticence is precisely what the part calls for . He seems to be thinking , and thinking doubtful thoughts , while he performs the requisite tasks . I don't mean to suggest that the film stinks in any way . Fuller may use stereotypes but he uses different stereotypes from the ones we expect . It's an in-your-face report of a handful of men doing a dangerous job requiring skill . No prattling on about why they're fighting . ( The enemy are simply " gooks " . ) And nobody dreamily describes the main street in Basset , Nebraska . Nor does some illiterate from Brooklyn tell the story of the goil me met on the Steeplechase at Cony Island . They're all too busy and too scared for that . There are a lot of close ups too , of sweaty , smudged , bearded , determined faces . In a way , it's primitive movie-making , in the way that Grandma Moses is a primitive painter . The most memorable feature of the movie is its set-bound , snow-bound pseudo-location . There is no wind to speak of , and although everyone's feet are in danger of frostbite , nobody's breath steams in the supercold air . And yet the rugged , snowy set is claustrophobic and as effective in invoking an atmosphere as anything short of a " Lawrence of Arabia " epic . On a low budget , this is about the best you can do , and it's pretty good .
Critique of Pure Shalloness	Hard to understand why some people become leaders if they have no more in the way of personal qualities than the rest of us . No - - I mean high school , not politics . In a way , high school status spheres seem to echo those of the society around them . The men compete for power and the women for popularity . In " Heathers " the most powerful boys are on the football team and the most popular girls are the best groomed and prettiest , in this case the three girls named Heather . Veronica ( Ryder ) is an acolyte . The lower rungs on the status ladder are represented by a tall girl with thick glasses and an ordinary pony tail instead of an elaborate coif whose name is Betty . ( Betty and Veronica ? Is this a literary allusion ? ) On the lowest rung of all is " Dumptruck " Dunnstock , an overweight reject . Christian Slater is Dean , the new boy in school , whose mother committed suicide and whose father rejoices in destroying wetlands and endangered species and historic landmarks through his demolition company . How Slater's dad chuckles as he watches the collapse of a big hotel on VHS . Basically , the story is this . Slater and Ryder kill the chief Heather by accident and fix the death up to look like a suicide . Slater then finagles Ryder into shooting and killing two stars of the football team , leaving a suicide note claiming the deaths were the result of a lovers ' pact . Teen suicide acquires a kind of cachet because , after all , people come to your funeral and laud you and your picture appears on TV and all , so other innocent teens begin to attempt suicide . Slater gets swept up in the destruction until by the end he has an apparatus in place to take out the entire high school , but Ryder has come to her senses and prevents him , after which Slater blows himself up . Lots of laughs here . Actually it's a pretty acid comment on being a teenager today . And let's face facts . It does give you ontological pause to discover that you have every material thing you need and therefor nothing to live for except 15 minutes of fame . None of these kids experiences anything remotely resembling a Calvinist " calling . " Whatever they're studying is never brought up . Nobody has ambitions that go beyond acceptance to " an Ivy League college , and please let it be Harvard . " I can believe their anxiety . I can believe their shallowness and spitefulness and cruelty and narcissism . Heather # 1 is defined by a sticker in her locker - - " I Shop , Therefor I am . " What's harder to believe is that Heather # 2 has read " Moby Dick " and has even underlined passages in it . As it appears in this movie , this is a generation that has lost touch with its cultural data base . A joke about a new novel , " Moby Dick , Part Two : Ahab's Revenge " , would be lost on them . They wouldn't get a reference to King Kong . The dialog is pretty snappy , the acting generally okay , and the gradually revealed bitterness in the script makes it different from most movies about teens . Yet the subject of middle-class high-school cliques has been so overdone that it's a little tedious to watch still another spiel , along the lines of " Clueless " and " Pretty in Pink " and the rest of them . Ho hum . It's interesting to note though that the farther removed in years I am from my high school days the more interesting high school cheerleaders in those tiny-skirted carnival-bright outfits become . Not just because they're attractive . All young girls are willy nilly attractive and sexy . It's their innocence that's captivating . Imagine being so willing to lend your allegiance to an organization that you are willing to dress up that way and jump around on a wooden floor , shaking your pom poms and kicking your bare legs up in front of hundreds of strangers . The film makers kind of missed the boat there . The school can't be all THAT dead with such a naked affirmation of devotion on the basketball court . Fewer movies about suicide and more movies about high school cheerleaders , I say .
Above average entry .	This is the one in which Robert Culp is a murderous motivational research scientist who uses subliminal cuts in an advertising film to lure his victim , Robert Middleton , out into the lobby of the screening room . It's pretty good too . Culp is a cool , thoroughly organized killer . He's more amused by Columbo's antics than irritated by them - - except when they screw up his golf game . And it has two truly likable supporting players : Chuck McCann and Louise Latham . McCann is intrinsically funny . There's something about his clown-like smile and the blubber that surrounds it that evokes smiles in his audience . He had a children's TV show in New York that was so outrageous that , even as an adult , I caught it whenever I could . Louise Latham will be immediately recognizable . She's not at all unattractive although her eyes almost meet each other , separated only by the thin bridge of her nose . As an actress , she's hard to beat . Her range is from mean and Southern to vulnerable and appealing , as she is here . I hope no one takes this subliminal motivation business too seriously . The impact is debatable but no one has claimed it can be used in a conspiracy to corrupt the population or get everyone to rush out and buy Nokia . I used a tachistoscope in some studies at Cornell and the results were minimal - - probably real for some people , but not very important . If you want to change someone's attitudes towards things or thoughts , there are more efficient ways of doing it .
Serial Killer Movie With Some Thought Behind It .	This is a strange movie . It's as if it had been cobbled together independently by several different intellects and sensibilities . It's not a particularly dumb movie , a pointless slasher product , despite its fashionably misspelled title . It's not a rerun of , say , " The Texas Chainsaw Massacre . " It's not arty either , not like , say , " Badlands , " although the people behind it must unquestionably have seen both earlier movies . Let me get an abstract of the story out of the way . A writer of stories about serial killers ( David Duchovny ) wants to travel out west to California with his photographer girl friend ( Carrie Laughlin ) and visit the scenes of mass murders , then write a book about them . To share expenses he agrees to take along two strangers , the bearded and vulgar Brad Pitt and his girl friend Juliette Lewis . He shouldn't have done it . Pitt turns out to be an exemplar of the type . There is a violent and gory climax . Each of the four main characters could be described in a couple of words , I suppose . Duchovny is the cheerfully tolerant , analytic writer who wants to get into the heads of serial killers but is happy enough to allow Pitt to liberate the occasional , well-controlled wild streak in him . ( Grinning like a little boy , he lets Pitt show him how to shoot a pistol . ) Laughlin is the snooty Eastern artist who is revolted by Pitt and Lewis and irritated by Duchovny's interest in them . Pitt is the hair ape who spits all the time , wears a cap with a Confederate flag , whips his woman when she drinks or cusses , and takes the shoes off his smelly feet in a restaurant . Lewis is the nincompoop who believes that since Pitt rescued her from a gang bang years ago he's her savior and master . She's romantic to the point of delusion and more interested in her yo-yo than in Pitt's transgressions . As for character development , Laughlin and Pitt don't change at all , from beginning to end . Duchovny's change is formulaic . The liberal finds that , under extreme circumstances , he can shoot and kill another human being because the script calls for it . Actually , Duchovny's character isn't very bright . When Pitt commits his first murder on the road , Duchovny peppers him with penetrating questions like , " You didn't have to kill that guy . Why did you do it ? For the power ? Because he reminded you of your father ? " Really . Well , as Duchovny admitted earlier , all he knows about serial killers is from library books , and he's evidently read Freud . Juliette Lewis is the most interesting character . She's full of " um " s and " ah " s and other hesitations and her performance is informed by a childish excitement until , near the end , when her fundamental decency is awakened and she turns on Pitt . In turn , Pitt has a better grasp of the character than the one he showed in the popular " Se7en , " another insulting title . Here , he's nicely animated . I have to say that the photography is fine too , and so is the location shooting and the set dressing . These kinds of skills are often neglected because they form a kind of background to the figures in the foreground , but they're important skills nonetheless . For what it is - - and it doesn't really pretend to be more than what it is - - a story of two ( or three , depending ) innocents who are emotionally and physically savaged by a serial murderer - - it's not nearly as bad as it might be . Here's how bad it might be . A couple of simple-minded happy-go-lucky college kids on spring break pick up two venomous hitch hikers and after assorted mayhem , including a couple of student deaths and considerably nudity , one or two of the surviving students manage to slaughter the hitch hikers . This film isn't that bad .
Toledo tycoon toe to toe with Himmler & the Russkies .	It's a fast-paced thriller about a mob of Himmler's goons in post-war Berlin who kidnap an American GI , the son of a big wheel in the ferris business , and who want to trade the kid back for a pair of burnt-out old anti-Nazi Germans so they can torture and kill them as revenge . Get that ? If not , it's not too important . The movie will make things almost clear enough . It's a lot of fun to watch . The acting required is negligible - - the plot is everything . Broderick Crawford does his " junkman " number from an earlier movie , a blustering materialist who comes to Germany to cut through the red tape and see that his kidnapped son is returned regardless of the cost . The price is the return of those two anti-Nazis , one of them already deliberately blinded by the Gestapo because of his involvement in the plot to assassinate Hitler . By the end of the movie , Crawford has seen the human face of Cold War intrigue and decides that the elderly couple should be saved . His feelings , of course , are as irrelevant after his change of heart as they were before . The job is in the hands of stern but human Major Gregory Peck . Peck snaps out orders and calls everyone by diminutives - - Stansman is " Stanzy , " Frau Hoffmeier is " Hoffy , " Colonel Ludovich is " Ludy " , Petrochine is " Petey " , and so on , so obsessively that one wonders if Nunally Johnson actually visualized the script . There's a little hole in the plot too , or maybe it's somewhere in my frontal lobes . Peck discovers that his former girl friend Hoffy is actually a spy for the Russkies ( or for Himmler's thugs , it's not clear ) . And she realizes at a critical point that Peck knows . How does she realize it ? I don't know . In the scene , Peck seems to do nothing that would arouse her suspicions . Maybe she is a Jungian intuitive type . But who cares ? You can't really take any of this seriously , not even the deaths that crop up in the story , because we have never seen the people who die . And the film is leavened with occasional shots of humor . Barnaby Jones - - I mean Buddy Ebson as the wisecracking sergeant keeps poking his head into a room full of guys listening to the radio and asks who's ahead - - the Yankees again ? And Ebson also has to go through one of those scenes in which he samples a bottle of absinthe , grimaces , shudders , and starts to speak in a hoarse whisper before clearing his throat and speaking normally . There is a running gag about a doctor who is trying to quit smoking by never carrying any cigarettes around , except that he keeps bumming them off other people . In my opinion the most amusing scene is one in which a British intelligence agent visits Peck and the two of them have soft drinks . On his way out , the Brit pauses at the door then walks back and leans over the secretary and asks what that stuff was in the brown bottle . " Root beer , sir , " she replies . He thinks for a moment , then comments , " Curious sort of stuff , don't you think ? " and leaves the room . Enjoyable minor film kind of drags you along with its quick unfolding of events .
Kind of cute .	This is an endearing episode , full of the usual whimsical , antinomian nonsense of the series . There's little logic and not much suspense . It's a comic adventure strip more than anything else , without a laugh track . Some gaggle of manufacturers has invented an anti-fertilizer that kills every living thing it's sprayed on , from earthworms to martlets . They plan to grab 40 million pounds in exchange for not wiping out Dorset . The dialog is keen and underplayed , just as the action scenes are outrageously overplayed . Mrs . Peel and one of the heavies trade snips of poetry about roses ( from Francis Thompson and Robert Herrick ) and before a fox hunt , Steed throws off a well-known epigram from Oscar Wilde . Mrs . Peel mentions the name of one of the hoods , a game keeper named Mellors . Steed replies , " Not Mellors THE game keeper , " and Emma throws him a glance with the density of basalt . I take the exchange to involve an allusion to Lady Chatterly's ithyphallic man-of-the-earth but don't want to take the time to make sure . Other curious exchanges are not so literary . Steed is speaking to an attractive woman who comments that he's a bit tall in the saddle , and Emma does a double take . Emma later also mentions something sarcastic about the babe's having " a good seat , " on which judgment Steed concurs . Emma shows one or two other signs of jealousy , and it raises the question of just what the hell these two have got going between them . The episode ends with two fox hunters riding Mrs . Peel down in a field before Steed charges on his white horse in to save her , the music intimating Wagner . That's some fox alright .
Beware of Old Ladies Bearing Knitting Needles .	Enjoyable whimsy . Diana Rigg disappears and is replaced by an innocent paid impostor , Liz Fraser , who has no idea why she's been hired for the job . Steed ( Patrick MacNee ) and Fraser try to track down the villains , who happen to run a knitting circle for elderly female persons . Some of them are programmed to go around stabbing people with their knitting needles . Steed and Fraser , on the trail of Diana Rigg , visit one of their classes where an effete man is instructing them on the rhythm of knitting - - " Worm and parcel with the lay , turn and serve the other way , " he sings - - or something like that . The wit is subdued and veddy British . Steed winds up getting coshed with large vases by accident , several times . That's about the closest anyone comes to a pratfall . Some of the quiet gags may get past younger viewers . The trail of clues leads to a team of lawyers called Barret , Barret , and Wimpole . Then to a costumiers led by a team named John , Paul , George - - and Fred . ( This is England , 1963 . ) After Diana Rigg is kidnapped at the start , very little is seen of her . Or - - well , she disappears for most of the film , but it would be inaccurate to say that little is seen of her . She appears at the beginning for a few seconds dressed in the tiniest swimsuit known to man or beast . It's short , but it's a very artistic scene . The whole thing is nonsense but an engaging divertimento .
eHarmony : The Prequel .	It gets a little wearisome explaining who John Steed and Mrs . Peel are , what their characters are like , the villains they typically encounter , and all the rest of the continuous features of this series . So I'll just point out one or two of the ways in which each episode is distinctive . In this case , men and women seeking marital partners through a matchmaking agency are being killed . I mean , like , eleven in a row . Steed and Mrs . Peel sign up separately and discover a nefarious plot in which the wealthier applicants are killed off , sometimes by each other , in order somehow to benefit the agency itself . ( The usual double entendres and underplayed jokes are present . When asked what kind of mate she is seeking , Mrs . Peel mentions good breeding and " stamina . " The interviewer raises his eyebrow . ) As a matter of fact , Steed is encouraged and finally persuaded to knock off Mrs . Peel , in return for another client knocking off the ( non-existent ) cousin who stands between Steed and the family fortune . Mrs . Peel is forced by circumstances to play possum and be displayed in an open coffin . She is almost caught by the heavies when , tipsy with the champagne that Steed has thoughtfully hidden with her , she climbs out and dances around in her shroud . There is a final brawl at a wedding display and someone gets hit in the face with a cake . Capricious incidents abound , barely rising above the silly . During a serious analysis of the goings on , Mrs . Peel is stretched on the sofa playing " The Ride of the Valkyries " on a tuba and Steed is chipping golf balls about the room . One of the balls bounces into the bell of the tuba and the scene dissolves with Steed trying desperately to extract the lodged golf ball with his putter . The episode is by no means below the average for the series .
The Killing Sickness .	Laird Cregar , whose last movie this was , was one of those actors whose kind we seldom see today . Tall and bulky , with the features of a flabby puppy and a smoothly articulated voice , he made a few films in which he played maniacs . Clearly , he was headed towards interesting character roles but died before any such career could be realized . His previous movie was " The Lodger " , an fictional examination of Jack the Ripper . You know Jack the Ripper ? That guy who murdered those " dance hall girls " in Victorian London ? This is a variation on that theme . He's George Harvey Bone , a noted composer of the period , who suffers from blackouts that last an hour or two , after which he's amnesic . He doesn't realize it but , as John Brahm's long opening pan shows us , Craigar murders people during those blackouts . Bone sees a doctor who specializes in brain diseases , George Sanders . Sanders suggests that Bone take time off from writing his new symphony and get to know ordinary people . It's too bad that Sanders didn't specify who those people should be , because , before he knows it , the somewhat unworldly Craigar finds himself being exploited by the treacherous chanteuse , Linda Darnell , looking just fine . She seduces him into writing popular songs for her act . All the music is written by Bernard Hermann . And Hermann's pop songs sound like ballads straight out of 1945 , with titles like " Forever Yours . " This George Sanders is a curious shrink . Suspecting - - no more than intuiting , really - - that Craigar may be up to no good during his blackouts , he sics a private investigator on the composer and alerts the police to his conjectures . This doesn't prevent a confrontation between Craigar and Linda Darnell . He strangles her , disguises her body as a Guy Fawkes dummy , and burns the corpse atop a community bonfire . Sanders and the police twig . They visit Craigar's apartment , reveal the evidence against him , and tell him that he must come with them and be sent to a hospital for the criminally insane . But he bolts because this is the opening night of his symphony and he must play the piano . The symphony begins as planned , with Craigar the featured musician , but when the cops show up all hell breaks loose and there is a final shot of Craigar playing out the last few melancholy chords while the empty music hall burns down around him and provides him with a Wagnerian exit passage . Not a bad movie , if a little depressing . Craigar isn't an ordinary murderer . He kills people he doesn't even know . And , as for Linda Darnell's lying , selfish tart - - well , she doesn't deserve to be strangled , but there's no reason he couldn't have turned her over his knee and giving her a darned good pranging . In fact , that might have been fun . Whatever illness Craigar suffered from is fictional , of course , but looks like some ungodly combination of psychomotor epilepsy and explosive personality disorder . And as for Sanders ' shrink , I wouldn't have paid his bill . Sanders should have sent Craigar , not out into the streets of London , but off to the Sussex downs where he might have quietly kept bees .
Unexpected Verisimilitude .	Vernon and Irene Castle were genuine historical figures whose dancing , and whose other commercial enterprises , became a craze in 1911 and lasted for some years . Vernon's contribution ended with his death in a flying accident during World War I . From what I can gather , this film sticks fairly closely to the facts , not only as regards their dance steps but other incidents in their lives , given the necessity for inventing some events and telescoping others . Irene Castle is credited as Technical Adviser and she evidently made something of a nuisance of herself on the set . She was displeased by Fred Astaire's idiosyncratic touches in the dances but reserved most of her criticism for Ginger Rogers . Rogers ' gowns weren't exact enough replicas of her own . They were , said Irene Castle , " too plunketty , " a reference to Walter Plunkett who designed them . Moreover , when Vernon and Irene meet in the film , Ginger Rogers dives awkwardly into the water , and Castle complained that she herself dived and swam much better than Rogers . How would you like to live with somebody like Irene Castle ? However , all but one of the songs are from the period , and they are orchestrated accurately - - banjos instead of guitars , and no saxophones . And the dance steps were taken as often as practicable from Irene Vernon's own published book of instructions . In one of them - - " Too Much Mustard " - - the feminist plaint is fully justified . Ginger Rogers does everything Fred Astaire does , only she does it backwards and in high heels . This was the last of seven or so movies that Fred and Ginger did together at RKO in the 1930s and they're both as charming and talented as ever . But the popularity of the Astaire / Rogers musicals had been waning and this example differs rather drastically from all the others . It's not just that this is their only period movie , and not just that it's based more or less on fact . It lacks the silly grace of their earlier films . There are no mixed identities , no misunderstandings . Neither star is compelled to pursue the other . They pretty much are together right from the start . And the film has a darker tone . When the couple are married and poor , they don't brush it off with a couple of wisecracks - - " Here are some peanuts . I only wish they were diamonds . " Their jokes about poverty have a feel of desperation about them . And the couple - - Rogers in particular - - have some scenes of genuine drama . It's more of a Hollywood biography than a romantic comedy . For my dough , there should have been more dances , and more romance in the dances we see . Dancing was a suspect activity in the pre-war period , viewed by bluenoses as couples snuggling together in a simulacrum of sexual activity . The Castles promoted dance as a non-sensual , even healthy way to stay fit . It deflected any tendency towards alcohol use , too . And that's what's missing from these numbers . Not the alcohol , but the sensuality . Give me " Let's Face the Music and Dance " any day . These dances look too much like part of the German water cure . As if to make up for it , Astaire gets to kiss Rogers for the first time on screen - - twice . The duo went their separate ways after this effort . The decision was a joint one . Rogers had ambitions of becoming an actress and indeed won an Academy Award for her performance in " Kitty Foyle . " She was a cute blue-eyed blond from the Midwest and a competent actress but not an outstanding one , and she was beginning a new career while approaching 30 . Astaire was even older , 40 , but stuck to dancing with other partners . He was as antic in " The Bandwagon " with Cyd Charisse , playing an aging hoofer , as he had been with Rogers fifteen years earlier . The team were reunited in 1949 at MGM for " The Barkleys of Broadway , " but the story was weak and there was something sad about the whole thing . Their RKO pictures had a throw-away charm and an enchantment that seems to endure though , and this was the final entry . Nice while it lasted .
Possibly the most disgusting episode ever .	This is the one about Al's toilet . Not a " commode , " not a " lavaratory , " not a " washroom , " not a " loo , " not a " dunnie " - - a toilet . Unsatisfied with the one in his house , which flushes with a feminine whoosh , and always has a jar of vinegar on the medicine-cabinet shelf , he decides to build his own bathroom in the garage . He buys a Ferguson toilet bowl , the Cadillac of toilets . " Once , my Dad drove me up to the factory in Maine to see the Fergusons being built . I only wish Dad were here now to ( breaks into sobs ) . " Al thinks himself the envy of everyone he knows , referring to " that green-eyed monster , jealousy , " paraphrasing Billy Shakespeare although he doesn't know it . The title of the episode is itself a rip off of Virginia Woolf's " A Room of One's Own . " The pun ( " dump " ) is the property of the writers . The room in the garage , which Al has trouble building , has everything , including a dedicated space for four toilet paper dispensers . He's encouraged in this enterprise by his neighbors . Steve recalls the last time Al used their toilet . " He killed my goldfish . " I don't think it's the funniest episode but it must be the most disgusting . It's impossible to imagine anything like this showing up on the air today . Pornography yes . " A Dump of My Own , " no .
Engaging waste of time .	There are so many stupid action movies out there - - mind-numbing , explosion-filled , cartoonish , slow-motion-bodies-falling , gore , ugly guns , special f / x , mismatched heroic couple of mixed sex , wisecracking villain - - and I've SEEN so many that I'm beginning to be able to tell the difference between them . This is one of the better ones . The plot has John Travolta as the smiling treacherous heavy , and Christian Slater as the true-blue captain in the USAF out to spoil Travolta's plot to blow up Denver with a kidnapped nuclear device . There is a cute red head thrown fortuitously together with Slater . She has nice plump lips , big blue eyes , and the tightly tailored slacks of a Park Ranger . Very nice . We watch her from below as she climbs the ladder on the side of a boxcar . There's no reason for her to be IN the movie except to have her climb boxcars , roll down sandy hills , and so on . But then there's no particular reason for ANYTHING to be in the movie . What I mean is that if you found it necessary to leave the room for a minute or two - - a knock on the door , a tug on the trigonal , whatever - - you would find that you hand't missed much when you returned . None of the characters changes in any way . There is no dialogue worth remembering . There are some unusual special effects but if you've missed one example it's okay because another is right around the corner . I particularly enjoy the scene in which the exploding bomb takes out the helicopter . I've sat through this thing three times and I am now convinced it has turned the higher reasoning centers of my brain into tofu . That's why I genuinely like it . I like it for Travolta's toothy reptilian grin , for Slater's imitation of Jack Nicholson , for the ripoffs from " Indiana Jones , " for the gorgeous Utah scenery , for the rocketing diesel train , Lake Powell , the redhead climbing the ladder , the fist fights , the bouncing Humvees , the civilian who proudly announces he used to be a lieutenant in the ROTC at Yale , the redhead climbing the ladder , the bodies of people who tumble in slow motion towards the camera as a fireball explodes behind them ( three times ) , the redhead climbing the ladder . I just like it , that's all . Anybody up for some sesame oil ?
Diverting trifle .	Cary Grant , Constance Bennett , and Roland Young in an amusing comedy about two ghosts ( Grant and Bennett ) showing banker Young how to have a good time . It takes them the entire movie to do it . Until the last five minutes , Young still seems stuffy and flustered by the antics he's been involved in . A lot depends on process photography and some of the gags are funnier than others . The ones designed to make the audience gape have lost their power to do so . ( A flat whitewall tire changes itself . Gasp . ) It wasn't something commonly seen on the screen in 1937 but this is post-Bewitched and post-I Dream of Genie . The amusing stuff comes later in the film when the story stops trying to wow the audience and concentrates instead on the reactions of the confounded outsiders - - a bellboy , a hotel manager , a house detective . When I was a kid Thorne Smith's paperbacks were all over the place and I found them witty and racy . They were lessons in historical linguistics ( they introduced me to the term " step ins " ) and Roman mythology . This film is from a Thorne Smith story but I imagine the notion of ghosts coming back to comically natter the living has been borrowed for dozens of other films , from " I Married a Witch " through " The Time of Their Lives " to - - what else ? - - " Ghost . " I don't know if it's just that my tastes have changed but the novels seemed funnier than this movie , which isn't bad as far as it goes .
Worth seeing once .	The story is almost rudimentary . An honest plain-speaking working man , Francois , is in love with a fresh-faced young Francoise , but she begins hanging around with an older man burdened with a diabolically sinister face , Valentin . The older man travels around with a trained dog act and a pretty but worn assistant , Clara , who falls in lust with Francois , much to the annoyance of Valentin . Actually neither man cares much about Clara . They both have their eyes on Francoise . There is a big argument between the two men in Francois ' room and Francois shoots and kills Valentin . The police surround the room in which Francois has hunkered down . He broods about the events in flashbacks , then shoots himself . Fin . Maybe I was expecting too much because the movie is generally regarded as a classic of its kind . " Poetic realism " ? The subtitles are sometimes far enough off to be amusing . The acting is nothing to write home about , but the direction is functional and the success of the movie - - and it IS successful - - hangs on the characterizations . Absolutely nobody is entirely sound morally . Take Francois ( Gabin ) . Yes , he's honest , plain-spoken , ordinary looking , and honest - - he hates people who lie . But , well , there's the business of that rather nasty murder . Valentin has just insulted the beautiful Francoise but he's also suggested that Francois is a pedophile for wanting her . It's at that point that Francois picks up the pistol and plugs the other guy . Is he responding with such fury to the insult aimed at Francoise - - or the one aimed at himself ? In either case , the insult is delivered casually , almost jokingly , and hardly an excuse for such an explosion of rage . And we can't overlook the fact that - - insult or no insult - - Francois is shooting and killing a rival for his girl friend's affections . All through the movie , Francois has shown himself to be ill tempered and the murder seems not much more than a logical expression of that character flaw . Valentin is evil looking alright . His eyes seem pasted onto the sides of his head . He wears a loud phony checked overcoat , as opposed to Francois ' working kit . He waves his hands dramatically . He lies fluently - - at one point claiming to be Francoise ' father . A roguish fellow , the sort , as he explains to the slightly dull Francois , that interests women , while Francois is the sort that women fall in love with . He's probably more perceptive than anyone else in the movie , even about himself . " People loathe me . I am a figure of ridicule , " he tells himself in the mirror . He's obviously meant to be some kind of bad guy . Why doesn't he leave Francois and Francoise alone to live happily ever after . Why does he keep NUDGING them ? Okay , but that's hardly enough justification for his murder . Anyway , his possessiveness towards Francoise does raise an interesting question . Not about Valentin but about Francoise . What is her game anyway ? She seems to like Francois well enough and kisses him warmly once in a while , and she keeps his photo on her mirror , although when he proposes marriage to her ( more than once ) she guides the conversation in a different direction . She turns down Francois ' offer of a soirée to watch Valentin perform in the café , but although she applauds enthusiastically and allows him to shepherd her around , she never seems to care that much for him . All in all , she's a blank . The complexity of the characters adds a layer of meaning to the movie that the plot simply can't supply . I was glad I watched it , in the same way I'd be happy to take another peek at the Mona Lisa , because everybody says its so good . But I don't think I'd watch it again .
Polished example of cop film	Just think about how far we've come in the years since " The New Centurions , " when it had to be explained to us that police officers could have problems at home and were sometimes imperfect in the execution of their jobs . There may be drearier locations to film in than the ones dug up for this film but it's hard to imagine what they'd look like . The two edgy partners seem to be constantly framed by the graffiti painted on the peeling walls behind them . But , in any case , these two cops are pretty fully worked out characters instead of the usual cartoons - - Danny Glover and Mel Gibson , Clint Eastwood and whoever . Jason Patric wears his guilt on his sleeve , while Ray Liotta desperately covers his own with a cloak of anger . Patric , while nobody's idea of a sissy , looks like the kind of guy who , freshly deloused and properly whipped into submission , could be turned into a priest . There is no such possibility for Liotta . With his elevator shoes and extra poundage the best he could hope for would be a spot in the zoo . This isn't a great movie but it's a relatively good one . When people get whacked with a gun butt they fall down and bleed , and they have trouble getting back on their feet . The language is that of the streets . You never feel that the writers , the director , or the performers think they's doing something outre in so often using - - well , let's call them the " f " word and the " m " word . Cussing comes as casually to these guys as it does to guests at a hip cocktail party . But I don't mean to suggest that the movie is a sellout . This is not a blood and brains fest . A few shots are fired on screen ( and some in which we are even deprived of the bullet's impact ) but not a big show is made of them . There is no real climactic shootout and no high-speed pursuit ending in a flaming fireball . There is some taste being exhibited on the screen . Kids who enjoy seeing someone's head rolling in the gutter will walk away disappointed . It's rather well done , in the end , with some surprising twists . It's a cop movie - - and it avoids being bad . I mean that as a compliment .
Emblematic 50s movie .	To get the bad stuff out of the way , the film is as talky as a staged play , it's formulaic , dated , the characters have about one-and-a-half dimensions , and there's little real doubt about who's going to win the race to become Tredway's ( or it it Treadmill's ) next president . But I kind of like it . Talky , yes , but the dialog is pretty good in the sense that it aids exposition and is efficient , with hardly a word thrown in for padding or individuality . This may be a cheap line of mass-produced work but its craftsmanship shows through . The acting is good too . The studios still had a line-up of competent professionals that they could depend on from one production to the next . Although I must say that June Allyson's incorporation , whatever her personal charm , has eluded me over the years . Despite her musical roles she's not much of a singer or a dancer , she's not staggeringly beautiful , and not a strong actress . I suppose she's good at being the supportive wife , as she is here , since I can think of three films offhand in which she played almost identical roles . She's a little like the Frank Sinatra of his later years . You can tell this is meant to be a drama because everybody is very intense about everything . Well , maybe except for Bill Holden who kisses his wife and banters about baseball with his kid . ( He's the only guy in contention for the presidency who has a family . ) And I guess Louis Calhern is pretty debonair as a heartless playboy , though his role lacks the je ne sais quoi of the corrupt Emmerich in " The Asphalt Jungle . " Robert Wise's direction moves the bodies around efficiently . There is some first-person camera work at the beginning , in which we see things from the boss's point of view . This kind of literalism has always been a little dicey because it's distracting when a hand reaches up out of the bottom of the frame with a dollar bill in it and we realize it's supposed to be our own hand . It's even more dizzying after the character drops dead of a heart attack and we're still seeing the scene through his eyes . The role of women in this movie is reflective of its times . With the exception of Barbara Stanywck as a dried-up unfulfilled heiress , they are wives and secretaries and mistresses . The executive suite is filled with men , each of whom could be thoroughly described by about two adjectives . Holden , the only guy with a family , is also the youngest of them by far and he gives a rip-roaring pep talk at the climax , tearing furniture apart , practically eating a table leg , and manages unconvincingly to convert all the dolts and drones seated around the table . The best performance , in my humble opinion , is by Frederic March as a by-the-book number cruncher . All the performers are pretty good but he's the most subtle of them all without seeming to have put much effort into his subtlety . A decent job , really , by just about everyone involved .
Not so obscure objects of desire	This wouldn't be much of a movie without the performances of the principals , namely Cate Blanchett and Judi Dench , because the story itself is a little like a soap opera . Dench is a lonely and bitter older woman , starved for love and sex . She teaches at the same school as Blanchett . Blanchett teaches art in the most general sense of the word . She has an older husband , who's fun , a snotty teen daughter and a son with Down's syndrome . She's not exactly starved for anything . Her life is not just busy but a little chaotic . At the same time she's flattered by the attentions of a horny , manipulative student of hers . The problem is that he's only fifteen , but it's a problem that both Blanchett and the boy manage to work through without any great problems . Dench wants to seduce Blanchett too . Her intentions are far more inclusive and demanding than the kid's . She wants to break up Blanchett's family and have Blanchett move in with her . Dench confides all this to her diary , which , as any politician can tell you , is going to turn out to be a great big mistake . Because Dench learns about the kid and , rebuffed by Blanchett , squeals on her and has her fired . Blanchett is so dumb that she has no idea that Dench is doing all this sub rosa . So the two ladies DO in fact move in together , but Blanchett thinks it's just " friendship " , not an " affair , " until she finds and reads through Dench's journal in a scene reminiscent of Charlotte Haze's finally discovering Humbert Humbert's diary . This leads to a break up of the nascent " affair . " Blanchett goes home to her forgiving husband . Densh continues trying to pick up attractive young women in Hampstead Heath . This is a woman's fantasy , with Blanchett as the central figure . Everyone desires her and some love her . They fight over her . And she's perfectly INNOCENT - - well , almost . In the end , she is even victimized by the press , a scene in which the entire movie collapses in upon itself . Everything goes hysterical and berserk - - the direction , the actress , the story , the score . Blanchett comes out ahead in the end . She's gotten what she wanted - - love from her family , sex with a young stallion , and she's crushed the Machiavellian Dench . Blanchett really is a knockout too . Not just because she's conventionally attractive but because she informs her character with such warmth and generosity . She's a Jungian sensation type , hungry for stimulus . And in seeking it she seems almost to be doing those around her a favor , or trying to . She manages , for instance , to convince herself that that guileful teen , the one who calls her up and says filthy things to her , the one who lies about his family's tragedies , just needs some physical reassurance . She's doing him a favor by sleeping with him . It has nothing to do with her or with the fact that , like all fifteen-year-old boys , this kid is a biological dynamo . What a coincidence . I felt a lot sorrier for Dench , the putative villain of the piece , who also winds up fired for not spilling the beans immediately upon learning that there were beans to be spilled . She's old . And she's not attractive . She has only her cat for company . ( And her diary . ) No one at the school likes her . Her attempts at being friendly are rather like an iceberg breaking away from the polar cap . She's as selfish as they come , without knowing it . When a man is old and homely , it's tough enough . For an unpleasant woman living alone , with no family or friends , with no job , it can be a disaster because she is truly socially bankrupt . Let her jot down her history of bitchery in that journal . It's the only thing she has . Well , I ought to mention that this is in no way a courtroom drama . When the affair is uncovered , Blanchett is fired and that's that . There's not much sex in it either . It's all about intrigue .
" Something's Wrong With the Entire System . "	" Something's wrong with the entire system , " says Wilton Sekzer , an aging Vietnam vet who lost his son on . When Sekzer first learned his son had died in the WTC , his first response was a surge in patriotism and a desire for revenge . When we invaded Iraq , Sekzer emailed the government and asked that his son's name be painted on a bomb , a wish that , surprisingly , was formally granted . A year or so later Vice President Cheney said on national television that Saddam Hussein was behind the attacks . The obvious untruth required a quick clarification from President Bush , whom Wilton saw on TV saying , " We have no evidence that ties Saddam Hussein to . What the Vice President actually meant was . . . " Wilton , who is no dummy , watched this aghast . He comes from the old school where the president walks on water , and " if you can't trust the president , who CAN you trust ? " The name of his dead son had been painted on a bomb that was dropped on a country against which there was no need for revenge . As propaganda , this is pretty well done . There isn't anything spectacularly innovative about it , although the story of the initial attacks on Baghdad by stealth bombers is interspersed through the film and builds up a sense of continuity . Both sides of the dispute are represented by talking heads and video clips . I'm unable to call them conservative or liberal , or right - or left wing , because those labels lie uneasily on the heads of the people who actively promoted the war and the rest of the civilized world . The techniques for discrediting the promoters , though , are clear and familiar . A talking head from the Project for a New American Century ( say , William Krystol ) makes a brief summary statement . And there follows a series of talking heads from the other side that dispute him point by point . ( Ho hum . ) Jarecki seems to divide the country into three parts . There's Dwight D . Eisenhower , who saw the military-industrial complex coming . There are the handful of people at the top who have governed the country from Eisenhower until now . And then there are the other 99 . 99 percent of us who are victimized by traditional propaganda techniques that shield us from what Jarecki sees as the truth . " Glittering generalities " is one such tactic . Why are we fighting " them " ( whoever they've been ) ? Because they are " evildoers . " Because we want to " liberate " them . Because we want to defend " freedom and democracy . " ( Interested parties can look up some other effective techniques at Disinfopedia . com , I think . ) Jarecki takes a materialist position in explaining why we seem to have been involved in so many wars lately , big and small , acting as the World's Policeman . It's because it's good for business . The film doesn't mention it but the current wave of job outsourcing is also good for business , if you're at or near the top of the ladder . Eisenhower's warning finally was repeated so often that it became desemanticized . And now there IS no military-industrial complex . The seams have disappeared and they are now one organizational entity - - a militaryindustrialcomplex . A revolving door exists between public service and the private sector . People shuffle back and forth almost at will . There's little separation between industry lobbyist and political personage . Richard Perle , one of the promoters , is right when he denies that the nation has been " hijacked " by a cabal of ideologues and that if we can only get rid of them , things will go back to the way they were . " We can never go back to the way it was , " says Perle . The building of a weapons system is as much a political process as a military one . Parts of the controversial B2 bomber are built in EVERY ONE of the 50 states , and it's the job of representatives to see that the largess keeps coming in . It's not just entirely legal , it's necessary if the official wants to be reelected . How else to account for the billions of dollars so far invested in the Raptor interceptor , a big new monstrously expensive airplane that can do everything except duplicate Donald O'Connor's dance number in " Singin ' in the Rain " ? Its only flaw is that it has no mission , since there are no bombers for it to intercept . Well , none of this material is particularly surprising , at least not to anyone who pays attention to the mainstream media and is open to diverse viewpoints . The chief difficulty with the film is that those who need most to see it will never do so . It doesn't have the folksy , popular appeal of Michael Moore's propaganda ( thank God ) . It has less innuendo and more thoughtful analysis . It DOES raise an interesting question though . Wilton Sekzer lost his son and enthusiastically endorsed the invasion of Iraq and the subsequent killing of tens of thousands of Iraqis , the vast majority of them innocent civilians . He wanted revenge , sure , but even if his assumptions about Hussein's guilt had been justified , why did he want to strike out at an entire nation and draw so MUCH blood ? I would ordinarily attribute this thirst for killing to the reptilian brain but I believe biological impulses can be overcome by cultural forces . Every time I'm ready to blame biology , something comes along that upsets my apple cart . After all , a few months ago , a stranger entered an Amish schoolhouse and unloosed a fusillade of bullets , killing a number of the children . He didn't know them or their families . He only chose the Amish school because it was the easiest to get into with a weapon . And what did the grieving Amish community do ? They quickly forgave the murderer . Then they invited the murderer's family to attend the kids ' funeral . Then they invited the murder's widow to join their sect ! There's something wrong with SOME systems alright .
Patriotic Gore .	Jack Ryan ( Harrison Ford ) is a CIA analyst who saves a royal Brit or two during an attempt by some Irish patriots on their lives . A captured IRA terrorist is Sean Bean , whose brother Harrison has just killed in self defense , and Bean will never give up his quest for revenge on Ryan and his family . It's always interesting to see what kind of heavy a movie gives us . The heavies are a chronicle of the times . In this instance it's unlikely that a story from Tom Clancy , a robustly nationalistic Irish-American novelist who plays with guns , is going to paint the Irish Revolutionary Army red , for reasons both sentimental and commercial . Nope . The gang that's after Harrison Ford and his kin are an OFFSHOOT of the IRA . It's a splinter group , see . Not the actual IRA . This splinter groups is so mean that they kill an IRA chief who tries to restrain them . And as if that weren't enough , Sean Bean turns out to be too evil even for the " ultra-violent splinter group " ( as Ford describes them ) . Bean is an iconoclastic loony who shoots the members of his own splinter group when they try to dissuade him from killing Ford . Bean's group has one member , himself . I guess that should put enough distance between the evil Sean Bean , on the one hand , and the Auld Sod on the other . After the initial violent encounter , the movie turns into a game of cat and mouse , with Bean the cat and Ryan the mouse . Bean escapes from captivity , pursues Ryan to Annapolis , and tries to kill everyone in sight . The climactic fight is done by the number in typical action movie style . Two speedboats on rough seas in the middle of the night during a thunderstorm . Bean as the pursuer produces a submachine gun and kills has compadres , then takes off after Ford in HIS boat . Bean sprays the other boat with lead . Tears it to shreds and sets some convenient tanks of gasoline afire , but misses Ford . Pursuer leaps onto burning boat at top speed , which is unforgivable if only because it lends itself to such an appalling pun ( " jumping bean " ) . In mano a mano combat , Ford ( a CIA bookworm and schoolteacher ) whips tough , highly trained Bean . Ford jumps off boat at last minute . Flaming boat with wounded Bean smashes into some rocks and explodes . Ford get medal , settles on couch back at home and hugs wife and daughter to him . The best scene in the movie shows us the CIA officials watching an infra-red live satellite feed of an attack on a terrorist training camp in Libya . The good little green dots sneak up on the sleeping bad little green dots . They make all the bad dots stop moving . Then a green helicopter comes in and the buildings in the camp blow up in big green flares . All we see are the satellite feeds and the tense faces of the viewers , including Ford's . Ford gulps as he watches the bad dots get murdered and blown to smithereens . Watching total strangers die seems to make him uncomfortable and , who knows , maybe a little guilty . What do we know about those terrorist camps anyway ? Who teaches whom , and what do they teach ? Do the " Red Brigade " and " The Shining Path " and the " IRA " and all these groups that are essentially irrelevant to one another , if not at odds , actually come together for a greater cause ? What's the cause ? What do they learn at a desert training camp that they couldn't learn more comfortably in a flat in the city ? Target practice ? Is that IT ? Clancy had his fingers on the pulse of a nuclear submarine in " The Hunt for Red October . " A techie manque reveled in the details . But all of this is more conventional stuff . It's a more personal story with a more generic villain . We don't learn much more than those trainees at the terrorist camps learn . In the end this is mostly recycled stuff from other action movies . In fact , this is the second time that I can remember Ann Archer getting into a car accident in an attempt to protect her daughter and coming up with nothing more than a becoming bruise on her eye . ( The other scene is in " Basic Instinct . " ) And Ford has a fist fight with a young terrorist , during which Ford is repeatedly punched in the face and body , and he emerges with a trickle of blood from one nostril and a similar trickle from the corner of his lips . Didn't ANYONE involved in this - - makeup or writers - - ever watch a fist fight in elementary school ? A punch in the nose doesn't result in a trickle of blood from one nostril . It leads to a gusher that splashes down your shirtfront , and when you try to wipe it away it leaves your face smeared . ( See " Shane " for a good example . ) As an ordinary action film it's not bad . Harrison Ford plays Jack Ryan as quiet and modest , but flawless too . In " The Hunt for Red October " the character had a fear of flying and that made him human like the rest of us . No such blemish mars the hero of this entertaining but routine action movie .
Macbeth-san .	Okay , the warriors Washizu and Miki ride back from a victorious battle through a magic forest and run into a wispy specter that tells them that Washizu will become king while Miki's son will inherit the kingdom . Coaxed by his wife , Washizu assassinates the king and takes his place . Again coaxed by his wife , he has his friend Miki killed as well . Well , Washizu ( Toshiro Mifune ) has made a lot of enemies by this time and they gang up on him , attack his castle , and kill him - - whereupon Miki's son takes the throne , thus fulfilling the prophecy . That's it , in brief . Can I skip the rest of the plot ? Read Shakespeare's MacBeth for the whole story . It's one of my favorite plays by WS , partly because it's the shortest that he ever wrote . I was led to believe Kurosawa's version of the tale deviated considerably from Shakespeare's and that it might be almost unrecognizable , but that's not the case at all . It's far from a filmed play , of course . In the play we only hear about the woods creeping up on the castle . Here we see the Spider Web Forest in full creepy motion . And if MacBeth is finally killed off stage by Duncan , here Washizu winds up with more arrows sticking out of him than a porcupine has quills . And of course Shakespeare's poetry is missing . Or , let's say , whereas Shakespeare's poetry was verbal , Kurosawa's is visual . And what a visual delight it is too , in inexpensive black and white , full frame . A terrific use of fog , lighting , spare sets , minimalistic acting punctuated by outrageous ham . Toshiro Mifune overacts to the extent that , at certain points , it becomes a miracle that his eyeballs stay in their sockets . There are , however , some differences . I think the editing might be off , or else I missed the part where Washizu gives the order for Miki to be killed . ( They bring Washizu Miki's lopped off head , missing in the play . ) If I remember , Madam MacBeth doesn't become pregnant and have a stillborn child either , as Washizu's wife does here . Also , in the play , she dies for reasons unexplained . Here , she seems to just disappear from the story , like the Fool in King Lear , unless I looked away from the screen at the wrong moment and missed some subtitles . ( Just listening to it is no help because I only understand a few words of Japanese and all of them are unprintable . ) " Is this a dagger that I see before me ? " is missing , naturally , but the Banquo's Ghost scene is kept just about intact . It includes the intrusion of Washizu's wife , trying to explain to the guests that her husband sometimes has these fits and spells when he's liquored up . ( How many ordinary wives have made the same apologies for their ordinary husbands ? ) But Washizu's wife does more than try to patch over her husband's gaffes . In the play , she merely propped up her husband when his ambition weakened , urged him to " screw your courage to the sticking place . " In Kurosawa's film , she's the INSTIGATOR of the whole thing . She's truly Machiavellian . Next to her , Washizu is a guileless moron who takes too much for granted and is too dumb to concoct her kinds of intrigues . Her emoting throughout is highly stylized and seems somehow artificial to Western eyes , but probably more accessible to those Japanese who are in the noh . I admit I found myself a little confused now and then . Especially during the first half , I couldn't keep the Lord's Castle , the Garrison , and the First , Second , and Third Fortresses straight . The play dealt mostly with titles - - the Glames or the Glans or whatever they were - - but in the film , the prizes are places as well as titles . It's a dark film , darker than the play that begat it . The three witches with their bubbling cauldron seem to be figures of fun , but the spectral old man who sings a tale of life is positively depressing , though spookier than the witches . The imagery in this scene is really notable . I keep hearing that Kurosawa was influenced by John Ford but it's hard to see how . Kurosawa was attracted to umberous , humorless stories . Ford rarely went without a dance or celebration of some sort . And Kurosawa tried suicide , whereas Ford was never in any such danger except for maybe drinking himself to death . I wonder if it had anything to do with Kurosawa's having fought on the losing side of a war and Ford's having been on the winning side . In any case , don't miss this .
Up into the shrouds , Lads !	It's Flynn's first big picture and it brings him together with Olivia DeHavilland , Michael Curtiz , and Erich Wolfgang Korngold . It's not their best movie together but it's a terrific introduction to the parts these personalities were to play in swashbucklers . Flynn is brash and cocky . ( He didn't change much until he began to physically deteriorate later in life . ) He projects his emotions the way a traffic light projects directions , with utter simplicity . There's never a moment when we doubt we know what he's thinking . He looks extremely handsome too ( he was 26 ) without being in the least effete . Olivia De Havilland is his perfect counterpart . She was never a raving beauty , but she's extremely feminine . She has a wide face with huge eyes , a dazzling smile , and a tinkling laugh . Where Flynn is adventurous she is cautious , thoughtful , often puzzled about her loyalties , and she holds things back , while Flynn shouts things out . The rest of the cast is filled with familiar faces from the 30s - - J . Carol Naish , Guy Kibbee , Lionel Atwill - - and they do their jobs well . It's a sound-stage bound movie with a lot of model work , some of it clumsy but still effective . A neatly done set is a tribute to the production designer . The banana plants grow neatly in picturesque places and the papier-mache palms beat the real thing . Natural locations are often cluttered with vegetation , but these jungles and beaches are flawless . They don't look like real locations . They look like what you wish real locations looked like . This is Erich Wolfgang Korngold's first score for a movie . ( He'd previously adapted Mendelsohn for an earlier one . ) It's often claimed that Hollywood composers were child prodigies but in Korngold's case it's not an exaggeration . He was studying piano and music theory at five , conducted his own cantata ( for Gustav Mahler ) at nine , and had his first work published at thirteen . He was a prolific composer too - - violin concertos , two operas - - by the time he was in his mid-thirties . Max Reinhardt sent him to Hollywood to write a few scores , of which this was one . It was thrown into his lap and he had to write it almost overnight . There was simply not enough time to do it all , so he stole a little from Liszt , the scene in which the Spanish pirates are looting the town . He returned to Europe to continue his career but , well , the continent by that time was no place for a guy named Korngold , genius or not . So he returned to Hollywood until after the war when he was able to go back to Europe and renew his composing . I don't mean to take up too much space dealing with Korngold , but the fact is that Flynn's early movies would just not be the same with anyone else . Korngold wrote music the way Flynn acted - - full of dash and bombast - - and some of it was stunningly lyrical . ( The simple love song in " The Sea Hawk " has a melodic progression that defies prediction . ) It's hardly worth noting that the name of this talented musician has been parodied elsewhere as " Wolfgang von Korngold " by another reviewer , Howydymax , whose penetrating insights into film fare I have usually admired and sometimes stolen from . Curtiz's direction had the same slam-bang quality as the composer's . Absolutely nothing artsy about it , a straightforward story . There are some weaknesses in the script . When I first saw it , finally , on TV , I'd been waiting for a chance for years and was frustrated because there didn't seem to be enough action . One longish scene of sailing ships pounding each other to pieces , and one fencing match between Basil Rathbone and Flynn - - too brief for my taste . Actually , at the time Flynn wasn't comfortable with swordplay and it shows . Rathbone , on the other hand , took up the sport seriously and was evidently a pretty accomplished fencer . I've seen it again recently and enjoyed it much more , a cartoon of a movie , full of intrigue , romance , and action . Well worth watching .
Engaging , skillful movie .	Nobody had ever heard of the senseless murder of four members of the Clutter family in Kansas . And then Truman Capote wrote about it . Let's see . Capote's story was serialized in The New Yorker . Then there was his non-fiction novel , " In Cold Blood , " so thoroughly hyped that it was even brought to my attention in a remote village in Samoa . Then there was " In Cold Blood , " the movie . Then another " In Cold Blood , " the TV movie . Then there was " Capote " with Philip Seymour Hoffman , about the writing of the non-fiction novel . And now " Infamous , " with Toby Jones as the homosexual author and a supporting cast of stars and semi-stars . Capote isn't around anymore , and in a way it's a blessing for him . He could never have topped this success . What could he possibly have done next ? The senseless murder of the eight members of the Tidy family ? It's pretty adroitly done here . Toby Jones is a more demonstrative Capote than Hoffman was , and things are made more dramatic , more spelled out . Capote's ambivalence - - he likes " the boys " but he needs their hanging to make his book work - - is not only shown to the audience , as it was in " Capote , " but it's described openly in a conversation between Capote and his friend Harper Lee . Lee is played by Sandra Bullock and this supporting role may be her best work . She seems , for the only time that I can remember , to be playing someone other than her usual flippant sexpot . Toby Jones resembles Capote more than Hoffman did in stature and in facial features , and Jones ' interpretation of the character is more animated . Hoffman's Capote was sly , a little reserved even , and his self interest was inferred . Jones ' Capote is made to be , not sly , but an open liar . What , for instance , was it that Perry Smith said to him about Mr . Clutter ? In the book , it is that Perry thought Clutter a fine gentleman . " I thought so right up until I cut his throat . " Very startling , right ? In this film , Capote tells his elite friends in New York three different versions of the statement , finally settling on the last as the most gripping . And rather than a quiet and almost dignified conversation with Perry , Capote in this film is roughed up by him , almost raped in the prison cell , and in the end the two seem to fall in love . ( Nothing of this appeared in the book . ) Perry and Dick are not especially convincing , either here or in " Capote . " The best Hickock and Smiths are in 1968's " In Cold Blood . " Hickock was clearly a dumb and careless psychopath . Perry Smith was a more complicated character , full of poor judgment and semi-magical fantasies , perhaps what's called a schizotypal personality . In 1968 , Robert Blake had Perry down pat . " Capote " was muted and had artistic ambitions , whereas " Infamous " is more commercially oriented . Not that that's bad . The pace of " Infamous " is faster , less demanding , but offers as many insights into the minds and motives of some very strange people indeed . And " Infamous " has a very telling final shot . Capote rises from his bed , calls Harper Lee , tells her that he's had such a wonderful and productive morning writing on his latest novel that he wants to celebrate . Somewhere fun . And the camera leaves him and drifts over to the writing pad on Capote's bed , where we see the title at the top of the page , " Answered Prayers , " and nothing underneath it but a blank page .
Two Self-Indulgent Achievers .	I'm absolutely sure that this film would be of more interest to film buffs and Welles fans than to the average viewer , although the buffs and fans might find it infuriating at times . The search for purity and perfection is bound to end in failure because , after all , who is pure ? And what is perfect ? The buffs and fans will probably gnash their teeth over historical inaccuracies and events and conversations that obviously must have been invented . They can join William Randolph Hearst and Orson Welles , because Hearst discovered that he didn't exercise pure power and Welles found out that his career was destined to be less than perfect . But the buffs and fans can still rejoice in knowing that they understand a little more than the rest of us about what the hell was going on in Hollywood and the rest of the world in 1940 and 1941 . Taken as just another movie , without reference to historical events , " RKO 281 " isn't bad . It's not the best made-for TV movie that HBO has come up with , but it's interesting to get a glimpse into the contrast - - and the similarities - - between Welles , a self-proclaimed genius and novice film maker , and Hearst , the old fuddy duddy who lived with his younger mistress in a castle on a hill on an estate half the size of Rhode Island . One was rich with the ideas and daring of youth . The other was rich , period . Good performances all around , as far as the principles go . Maybe Melanie Griffith isn't the vivacious and mischievous hostess that Marian Davies was said to have been , but she gets the job done . Liev Schreiber is a passable Welles , though not as handsome to the heterosexual eye as was the 25-year-old prodigy himself . John Cromwell probably gives the best performance as Hearst , the man who owned too much . It's a complex character role , not easy to play . Hearst isn't the kind of guy you'd like to have a beer with , but Cromwell manages to make him rather sympathetic at times . John Malkovich is Herman Mankowitz , co-writer of " Citizen Kane , " and he's reliable , as always . Too bad they left out the incident at which Mankowitz , drunk , vomited at the dinner table and apologized by saying , " It's alright , Mister Hearst . The white wine came up with the fish . " If there's a weak thread running through the story of this battle , it's the script . Sometimes it positively flows , as in Welles ' speech to the RKO board in New York . At other times , it seems as if the writer had one eye on a textbook for Screen Writing 101 . Why would an American , even a stuffy one , substitute the British " shall " for the red-white-and-blue " will " ? Entire conversations sound stilted and aimed at immediate comprehension by the viewer , attempts to spare him the torture of thought . No , it's not a TV masterpiece , but it's a good job of commercial film making , the kind that HBO can sometimes be very good at . I think most people would find it engaging enough to hold their attention . Especially , as I say , the buffs and fans . I'm not sure about those who might have to stretch in order to grasp the concept of " Hitler " - - never mind " RKO 281 " .
Subdued and Evocative .	The execution , by Orson Welles and his comrades in arts , is superb but the story itself almost buries its implications for modern society under one of those multi-dimensional generational narratives , like " The Young Philadelphians " or even " Peyton Place . " Young George Amberson Minafer ( Tim Holt ) grows up from a spoiled brat in a rich Indianapolis family to become a spoiled brat in a family that's on its way downhill , while the older Eugene Morgan ( Joseph Cotten ) , whom Georgie hates , and Morgan's daughter Lucy ( Ann Baxter ) , whom Georgie loves , turn into a wealthy automobile manufacturing family . Georgie gives up what little he has left in order to support his Aunt Fanny ( Agnes Moorehead ) and , in the end , everybody comes to appreciate Georgie for his self-sacrifice . Not that it appears to help Georgie very much , since by now he's broke and in the hospital with two fractured legs , having been run over by one of the automobiles he loathes . This was Welles ' follow-up to the magnificent " Citizen Kane . " It was shot in 1941 . And it would be nice to say that it's up to the standards of the first movie but it's not . There's a good deal of shouting , running around , and dancing , but it's rather a slow slog through the years . The theme that would most impress modern viewers is similar to that of " How Green Was My Valley , " the virtual destruction of intimate , small-town life , by the spread of an ugly industry . That's my impression anyway . I'm old enough to remember standing on the streets of a city - - Phoenix , Arizona - - and being able to look down a thoroughfare and see the desert at both ends . Old enough to remember New Jersey before its last inch of greensward was paved over . Yes , it's true . I don't like smog and urban sprawl . Oh , where did it all go ? ( Sob . ) Well , not to be too depressing , some people seem to love look-alike shopping malls . A chaque a son gout . Welles ' film doesn't spend enough time on what I consider a pretty powerful theme . It's most hinted at . In the opening scenes , Welles ' jovial narration tells us how much time everyone had and how simple life's more mechanical aspects seemed . Later , we notice telephone poles have grown alongside the city's roads . And towards the end the narration tells us explicitly what the screen shows us - - an ugly city , befouling itself . Not that there's anything wrong with the performances or with Welles ' directorial technique or with Bernard Hermann's score or Stanley Cortez's photography . The camera work is artful in fact . Cortez shot several lengthy scenes following the actors around with a sixty-pound camera strapped to his chest . I'm not sure that the faults of the film belong to Orson Welles alone . The shooting was interrupted by Pearl Harbor and Welles was sent off to Latin America to make sure the good folk South of the Border didn't make any critical mistakes in choosing their allegiances . So some of the remaining scenes were directed by committee . And Welles wasn't available to supervise the editing . He tried doing it long distance , sending Robert Wise six-page telegrams full of instructions that were , to Wise , " incomprehensible . " A final shot was filmed that would have evoked the last warehouse inventory of " Citizen Kane , " a long survey of the empty Amberson mansion with its furniture shrouded in sheets , but the studio cut it out . Who knows what else wound up on the floor ? There isn't enough room to examine the film - - its virtues and its flaws - - as thoroughly as it should be , so let's summarize by saying it's worth watching .
In the Zone	A drama involving political intrigue , smuggling , and general malfeasance in the Eastern and Western Zones of Berlin . James Mason is the smooth operator who smuggles such commodities as meat from the West into the needy Stalinist East . Claire Bloom is the innocent who is visiting her brother Geoffrey Toone , a British army officer , and his wife , Hildegarde Knef , who was once married to Mason . In order to trap a Western operative , the villains extraordinarily extradite Claire Bloom and hole her up in an East Berlin dump . She is rescued by Mason for selfish reasons . He's trying to flee to the West himself , with a good deed on his record , so that when he surrenders to the police they'll go easier on him . Mason and Bloom are pursued in a suspenseful chase through the Eastern Zone . By this time Bloom has fallen for Mason , despite his warnings about his own character and deeds , and they wind up spending the night together . The next day they make a break for the border . Bloom makes it . In an act of self sacrifice , Mason does not . The first thing I thought of , after missing the credits , was that the writers and director had surely seen " The Third Man " and learned from it . The plot is similar . And the director tilts his camera at the same angles and at the same times as in the original , and there are close ups of suspicious faces observing events out of the sides of their eyes . It was therefore no surprise to find that Carol Reed had directed both films . The location shooting is just fine , as is the photography by Desmond Dickenson . Mid-winter in a starving and rubble-strewn East Berlin . Everything burdened with a heavy snow blanket except the streets that are glazed with ice . Brrr . It's a good movie . The characters are well written . We're on one side , rather than the other , but the principal character is properly ambiguous . A plot for grown ups . Mason looks the part but he's simply not very good at a German accent . He was an embarrassment in another film as Irwin Rommel . And his death struck me as melodramatic . Claire Bloom , in only her fourth movie , does splendidly as the naive but righteous English girl . She's beautiful too , in a classic way . Her smile lights up the screen and makes her piercing black eyes almost disappear for a moment . Hildegarde Knef is equally attractive and just as good an actress but in a very different way . Her appearance , as well as her performance , suggests a good deal of experience and knowingness . It's not " The Third Man " though . ( So few films can clear THAT bar . ) And Carol Reed entered a slow decline after this , for some reason , winding up with the abysmal " The Public Eye " in the early 1970s . Yet his talent shows through all the murky shadows on the screen and we find ourselves enjoying a taut and exciting story , well worth seeing .
" Holy # @ # % , Boss , Somebody Done the Job on Zingo ! "	I'm not sure Richard Condon has ever written a serious word in his life . " The Manchurian Candidate " had its pathos but it was largely masked by Condon's prose style - - detached , ironic , and humorous . In another novel he describes a typical meal for his Alfred Hitchcok character and it takes up half of a full page . ( So many " rashers of bacon , " a joint of mutton , three apple pies , and so on . ) John Huston has got the style pretty much down pat in this film , although if you're not prepared for it , the intentionality might slip by you and you wind up with a pale drama . I guess by 1985 , the year this film was released , the mob movie was ripe for a parody . Some seventeen years elapsed between " Frankenstein " and " Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein , " and about thirteen years between " The Godfather " and " Prizzi's Honor . " When a genre is so near exhaustion it doesn't have many places left to go . No one in this movie seems authentically " Italian " , as we've learned that authenticity from the mob movies , not even Robert Loggia . The most hilarious impersonation is given by William Hickey . He's a wizened , gaunt Don Corrado , a tiny frame , his voice a hoarse , goaty whine with more ups and unanticipated dips than a roller coaster ride . The other performances are good too . The dialog is out of a comic book . People " clip " one another or they " zotz " each other . Nine hundred thousand dollars is " nine hundred dollars . " Everyone is evil but some are more evil than others , just as in " The Godfather . " There is a happy ending for Jack Nicholson as Charlie Partanna , a hit man who winds up murdering his own wife . ( Man , what happened to the code ? ) You probably won't respond to this very warmly if you are looking for another movie about the Mafia with lots of tragedy and gore . But if you're able to accept this as an adumbration of movies like " Analyze This " ( a much more obvious and funnier movie ) you'll get a kick out of it .
Tragic and ennobling .	A . L . Kroeber was a fascinating and brilliant man , completely devoted to his field . During the earthquake of April , 1906 , he pulled himself out of the rubble in his downtown home , shook off the dust , and walked many miles up hill to check on his Museum , which was located where the U . C . Medical Center now stands , at the top of Parnassus . He was into everything . He was the first person to bring anthropology to the West Coast and almost everyone who met him considered themselves friends of his . He also wrote what was probably the most lucid and all-encompassing general text of anthropology , a huge 1948 tome , which is now considered out of date because of its content ( we now know a lot more ) and its approach ( culture as determined by history and styles rather than materialism ) . The progressives dislike him for this and for the fact that his benefactress was Phoebe Hearst . And yet , he was devilishly smart , able to outline some social problems that we are only now trying to cope with , like globalization , which he called " the universal pattern . " What happens when the whole world depends on an oil-based industry - - and then we run out of oil ? I won't go on about him except to say that he loved his first wife - - Ann Archer in this movie - - that his second wife , Theodora , wrote a graceful biography of Kroeber , subtitled , I think , " A Personal Configuration . " Also , the " K . " in Ursula K . LeGuinn stands for " Kroeber , " since she was his daughter . The movie itself sometimes lapses into clichés but there are blessedly few of them . It's been years since I read " Ishi : The Last Yahi , " but as I remember it he was consistently polite and cooperative . The movie yields to the temptation to make him a bit of a mystic , listening to the song of the earth ( which Kroeber is unable to hear ) . But I don't know if such beliefs are so alien to the spirit of the Indians of California . There are other conjectural episodes added to spice up what the writers might otherwise have thought a too-pedestrian story . Ishi gets deflowered . The next morning we see him humming happily to himself , hard at work polishing the glass cases in the museum . The movie also turns Kroeber into a kind of stereotypical scientist . " You have Ishi here ? " Ishi asks Kroeber , tapping Kroeber's notebook . " In the book ? Yes . " " But not here , " says Ishi , tapping Kroeber's chest . But , well , okay , so it's poetic license . ( I think actual documentaries of Ishi's life with the white folks are available . ) The performances are outstanding . If the film creaks at the joints while straining to make the characters look human , the performers take it over the finish line . God , John Voight can be a good actor when he gets his teeth into a role . Here he does a splendid job as a man who puts as much distance as he can between himself and human emotions . Voight expertly conveys the discomfort and helplessness Kroeber feels when faced with unpleasantness . It makes his final breakdown , when he sings abjectly over Ishi's death mask , almost unbearably moving . Without the delicate touches provided by the actors , what we would otherwise have is the story of a man " getting in touch with his feelings , " whatever that means . Being an Indian in California wasn't all bad , at least until the white folks came along . ( Stereotypical incidents - - two of them - - of hairy white men shooting down helpless Yahi . Not to say that it didn't happen in early California , because it did . ) The Chumash lived in what is now Santa Barbara , for instance . They left huge piles of garbage behind . If you were to dig in one of OUR old garbage dumps , you'd find that the deeper you dig , the more " primitive " the tools become . There may be disposable ballpoint pens at the top , but under that would be a layer of ballpoints made to last , and under that a layer of fountain pens , and under that ink pens with long wooden handles , then quill pens , and so on . But if you dig into a Chumash garbage dump , you can dig down through three thousand years of their history and find virtually no change in their artifacts . Why should they invent new stuff ? They didn't need it . They had it made . Of course , tragically , the Chumash have now gone the way of the Yahi and the various tribes that were incorporated into the 21 California missions , most of whom died of disease . Next time you visit Mission San Juan Bautista , consider the fact that just over the low stone wall there are roughly 3 , 000 unmarked Indian graves . Ishi has a lot of company .
Some mean mothers - -	As a critic , Edgar Allan Poe had a simple theory of literary aesthetics . Throw logic out the window and go for the effect . Does it really MATTER why the guy is in a pitch-black room with a pit in the middle and a scythe swinging overhead ? As a novelist Michael Crighton is too much the techie to ignore logic . He gives us a step-by-step recreation of the process by which dinosaurs can be resurrected . Then he throws in some kinds of his own . He has a juvenile T . rex finding a helpless human being that is about to become a meal . And the dinosaur plays with his victim , the way a cat plays with an injured mouse . A bit of a stretch because , unlike mammals , reptiles aren't known for their playfulness . Steven Spielberg's movie version of the novel is epic , heroic , monumental - - and big . Everything about it is big . The novel , grand enough in itself , seems to have exploded gloriously on the screen . And , the introductory explanation of dinosaur resurrection aside , it follows Poe's theory closely . One glitch in the system and the id is loosed on a dozen or so people in Jurassic Park , a kind of living Disneyland . ( Attenborough : " Nothing works perfectly the first time . When Disneyland was first opened nothing worked . " Goldblum : " When The Pirates of the Caribbean stopped working , the pirates didn't eat the tourists . " ) After the glitch , similar to the one in Crighton's " Westworld " , the administrators and experts running the park have to do a lot of running themselves to escape the various man eaters . It was sharks in Spielberg's " Jaws . " And , man , that must be one primeval fear . Everybody faces eventual dissolution , running out of telomeres , but being EATEN ALIVE is another matter . A common dream involves being chased by some unknown monstrous anthropophage while we seem to slog in slow motion through a pond of molasses . And people do get eaten in this movie . The first two of them are bad guys anyway , one an overweight , giggling industrial spy who is so stupid he tries to play " fetch " with his pursuer . The other is " a blood-sucking lawyer " who is snapped up while sitting on the john . The movie is one big set piece after another . It isn't possible to describe them all , and not necessary really , because if you can think of a suspenseful scene that might take place in this kind of narrative context , you'll find it here . There are innumerably cross-cuts between a catastrophe about to happen and someone elsewhere feverishly trying to prevent the catastrophe from happening . Chase scenes abound - - on open plains , among museum displays , in computer rooms , in cars , in large kitchens . Someone hollers to someone else who is threatened : " Don't move ! He can only see you if you MOVE ! " The potential victim moves . A lot depends on special effects and CGI and they are splendid . The dinosaurs seem real enough , attended by appropriate sounds . ( The sound man should get a medal . ) Not just roars but chirps , whistles , the patter of heavy rain drops on Plexiglas , the thud of gigantic reptilian feet on earth . " Impact tremors " , observes Goldblum . The musical score never leaves us in doubt about what we are supposed to feel . The first sight of a couple of those towering beasts is accompanied by a heavenly choir . ( A neon sign should be blinking , " Awe " . ) Spielberg lets his story and his imagination run wild and it carries you along . The whole family will be glued to the set . If the theme had been cheerier it could easily have been made by the old Walt Disney studio . A slight problem is that when you go for big effects you sometimes lose a little in the way of continuity . I mean , the fat guy playing " fetch " with his killer , for instance . And then there are Sam O'Neill and the two kids , traipsing through the bush . They've just been attacked and almost killed by T . rex and they've seen a man eaten alive . So what do they do ? They settle down and sleep for the night in the crook of a huge tree , smiling . When they see a couple of herbivorous animals with necks the size and shape of the Washington monument , O'Neill cheerfully begins to hoot at them to see if they will answer or - - better yet - - come to him and let the kids pet them . Right . The dinosaurs leave mists when they breathe on glass . Are they warm blooded ? As I recall , their hearts have three and a half chambers or something . We see one of the little buggers hatch from her egg , and the egg tooth she should probably have is absent . There is some business about frog DNA having gotten mixed up with the dino DNA , so the dinos have become a greater threat because they are now able to reproduce . But they may not have needed the frogs because in modern reptiles parthenogenesis isn't uncommon . Where I live , we're surrounded by New Mexico whiptail lizards and every one of them is a female , just as in the movie . I don't know if they LIKE it , but that's the way it is . That's just carping though . There's a bit of philosophizing near the beginning . Is it right or wrong to resurrect dinosaurs . But the conversation doesn't lead anywhere , and I suppose it's just there to remind us not to fool Mother Nature - - as if we cared . The question is a real one . Is nature there only to be shaped to our utilitarian ends ? Or is it better to live in harmony with our own ecosystem . That's a lot different from asking if it's right for elephants to have tusks , but the movie isn't interested in the issue because it might irritate our nervous systems . Better to stick with Poe . Fascinating movie . Spielberg has his fingers on the public pulse . Or his probes into our reptilian brains .
Non-stop action on a dusty Korean hill .	This , despite its weaknesses , is quite a good movie . There is little sentimentality and no romance . It's all dust and death on both sides , the dwindling American force commanded by Gregory Peck and the Communist Chinese enemy . It's based on S . L . A . Marshall's book of the same name , which focused , as does the film , on small-scale operations while not ignoring the larger picture . The larger picture is roughly this . Pork Chop Hill is a salient in the dividing line between two opposing armies and the cease fire is about to be signed at Panmunjom . In itself it is of no military importance , and all logic - - not just military reasoning but common sense - - dictates that the cease-fire line be straightened out and the hill ignored . Instead , both sides pour troops onto this insignificant little mountain , denuded of vegetation by long bombardment , a heap of rocky rubble laced with trenches . It's sometimes said that Gregory Peck is a wooden actor and I guess I'd agree he's nobody's idea of Cary Grant when it comes to light comedy . His specialty lay in radiating an understated sincerity and leadership quality . He never pulled it off in a mechanical way either . There were always at least a few lines in which we recognized the human being behind the mask , and that's the case here . When he's handed an order that means he must send back his recently arrived , desperately need reinforcements , he pauses and says quietly , " Well , they can't mean this , " and we believe that he believes that they can't mean this . The rest of the cast has many familiar faces and none of them let the film down . One scene is perhaps the best that Harry Guardino has left on celluloid . The very air of the movie seems filled with fear , sweat , and dust . But then there are the weaknesses . Marshall's book was unforgiving . When the higher echelons screwed up , Marshall noted it just as matter-of-factly as he noted the number of rounds expended by a given platoon during a given incident . In this film , somebody makes a mistake and turns on the searchlights at the wrong time . It's quickly corrected and the miscreants later explain that they mixed up Peck's unit with another - - and they apologize ! And that's about it as far as errors on our side go . The later contretemps that deprive Peck of reinforcements and supplies are due to an unavoidable failure in communication , so it's nobody's fault . Then there's the " Here comes the cavalry ! " ending , which didn't happen , according to Marshall's book , if I remember it correctly . And sometimes the script spells things out in an unnecessary way . Guardino's friend is killed and Peck has to drag him away from the body , while he screams , " He was my BUDDY . " Well - - we know that . It's already been demonstrated . So to whom is that line addressed ? Audience members who don't know that stress generates fierce friendships ? And there's a final , even more unsettling failure to stand back from events and view them objectively , an unwillingness or inability to step outside the box . We see the Peace Talks taking place . The representative for our side explains to the Chinese , " According to the truce , Pork Chop Hill is right in the middle of the truce zone . You know it has no value so why don't you withdraw your men ? " ( The Chinese negotiator turns down his ear plug . ) The Allied negotiators step outside and mutter angrily that the Chinese just don't want to lose the hill for symbolic reasons . Well , what kind of cockeyed moral calculus is this ? Isn't OUR side equally willing to sacrifice lives for the symbolic value of the hill ? If the reasoning of the Chinese is wrong , isn't our reasoning , which is precisely the same , equally wrong ? Soccer riots are better justified . Enough preaching . This is one tough film . Despite the injections from Hollywood of the 1950s , we get a convincing picture of what combat is like . Death comes almost at random , and it's not always pretty . Bodies don't always have neat bullet holes through the shoulder . Sometimes they're visibly mangled , although the visuals aren't in any way offensive . And Peck does a superb job . So this is well worth seeing .
A Fine Example of Early Hitch .	What a craftsmanlike job Hitchcock did on this one . It belongs to his chase / thriller category but it's neatly plumped out by comedic and serious dramatic interludes . It may seem strictly an entertainment , but that episode involving the dour Scottish farmer and his lonely , compassionate wife is like a little short story in itself , and blended effectively into the overall story . What's also impressive about it is how much it presages Hitchcock's later favorite kinds of scenes . The man stuck in a public space , the exits covered by his pursuers , who must try to improvise his way out of danger . In this instance , Robert Donat sneaks into a political meeting and is mistaken for the keynote speaker . He stands at the podium and gives a rousing speech full of political malarkey that has the audience on its feet clapping and shouting . His pursuers still manage to nail him and lead him away in manacles but as the police escort him through the door , the audience turns and cheers him again while he waves his grinning farewell with a shackled hand . ( A situation nicely handled in " North by Northwest , " too , at an auction . ) The fact that it works is evidenced by the thousand times it's been copied . ( Vide , " The Prize . " ) The script is quite funny , and sexy too . Scotland looks so barren and windswept . It's hard to believe those bens were once covered by natural forests . The performances are up to par . Poor Donat died of asthma , which is an unpleasant way to go . Madeleine Carrol was a beautiful blond , one of Hitchcock's first . He seemed to like frosty blonds , but he was never a sentimental mope . Years later he was shooting at a location only a few blocks from where Carrol lived and never bothered to visit her . Peggy Ashcroft , as the farmer's wife , gives a first-rate performance . And she has an inner beauty that transcends anything resembling glamor . She looks almost compellingly homely in this part . One wants to be a kitten and curl up in her lap , certain of being treated gently . Great stuff here .
Robust and unpretentious comedy from Ford .	I can't remember the silent version , which I saw years ago . I think it's probably best known for the fact that the cuss words of Captain Flagg and Sergeant Quirt were clearly discernible , even to viewers without advanced training in lip reading . I have no idea what the original play was like . Ford's version could be described as pointless , energetic , and at times extremely amusing . There are battle scenes , of course , because this romantic triangle between Flagg ( Cagney ) , Quirt ( Dailey ) , and Charmaine ( Calvet ) is being played out against the muddy background of World War I . But , with a few exceptions , the combat scenes , like the romance , are played for laughs . And not in the black-comedy manner of " Dr . Strangelove , " either . ( That sort of ridiculous tragedy might be beyond Ford's comprehension . ) No , the shots of Dailey and Cagney crawling through the mud of No Man's Land with a German prisoner in tow are funny in themselves . Even when the German is killed by shell fire and Dailey is wounded . It's in no way a " deep " film . Nothing so banal as " war is hell . " And it is certainly not one of those anti-war films in which we bleed , sometimes without purpose , but we always win in the end . Flagg's unit marches off to battle yet again , with some of the men limping from wounds and Flagg himself drunk , but there is no triumphant final clash . As pure entertainment , it succeeds fully . The Ephrons , who wrote the screenplay , must have had second sight into the interests and talents of Ford , Cagney , and Dailey because they're all superb . The dialog has to be heard to be enjoyed . Waving his finger as if in an Italian opera , Cagney shouts at the heroic Robert Wagner , " Boy - - I'm going to see that you are sent up for a decoration ! Furthermore - - I PERSONALLY am going to give you - - TEN FRANCS ! " Cagney has never given a more outrageously animated performance , brusque , stomping , marching around , fuming , looking cockeyed . All his mannerisms are here and he plays them to the hilt . Dailey is only a few steps behind him . And Corinne Calvet as the perfidious Charmaine puts what she has into the role but the character , while maddeningly flirtatious , comes across as a little insipid too . How could it be otherwise ? Look at the company she's in . Wagner's love affair with the school-girlish Marissa Pavan is taken seriously , though , and a sappy , sentimental love song is sneaked into the script . Calvet sings a couple of period songs too , but they're mercifully brief . I never cared a fig whether Flagg or Quirt or either of them got to marry Charmaine . And the " what price glory ? " speech , given by a seriously wounded Marine , is misdirected at Flagg . Whatever else Flagg may be interested in , it's not glory . Ford had his demons and was not an easy man to work with , or even necessarily to be acquainted with . In his memoirs , James Cagney recounts some stunt Ford had performed over and over , involving a motorcycle and sidecar plowing into a pile of manure . The gags weren't funny . They were just sadistic and dangerous . And a few years after this release , Ford called Robert Wagner into his office and asked if he was interested in the part of Martin Pawley in the upcoming " The Searchers . " Wagner eagerly said yes , and Ford asked why . Wagner explained - - great script , fascinating character , and so on , until Ford replied , " That's too bad because I've already given the part to Jeffery Hunter . " The disappointed Wagner was half-way out the door when Ford stopped him . " Do you REALLY want that part badly ? " " Yes , " said Wagner . Ford said , " But Jeffrey Hunter is going to play it . " End of interview . Ford's Schadenfreude notwithstanding , it's hard to beat this comedy for sheer momentum . When James Gleason , as a Marine General , sweeps into Cagney's office with a map he wants Cagney to examine , the two of them simply brush all the junk on Cagney's desk onto the floor and spread out the map . What kind of mind thinks up such a gesture ?
War is Heck .	George Clooney leads a group of ordinary GIs into Iraq in pursuit of Saddam Hussein's gold bullion in the aftermath of the Gulf War . ( Kids , that was 1991 . We won . ) At first the film looks like " Kelly's Heroes . " But that's only because the targeted gold allows for an exploration of some of the internal political dynamics of Iraq , and for some outstanding if commercially handled action scenes as well . The gold is a MacGuffin , just a plot point to keep our guys on the move , in and out of danger . The Iraqi soldiers are mostly presented as stereotypical villains . While the Americans look on , the Iraqi army captures a handful of anti-Saddam rebels . Then they shoot a woman at point blank range through the head while her young husband and little girl look on . The scene isn't handled discreetly . The woman falls to the sand and a pool of blood forms under her while the daughter tears herself loose and runs to the corpse , shrieking , " Mamma , mama ! " In a way it's the opposite of how Spielberg handled atrocity in " Schindler's List , " where such scenes are presented matter of factly , under the assumption that the mature audience knows how horrible these acts are without being kicked in the pants by a screaming child . But then there's an adolescent quality in much of the direction . Sometimes the action is thrilling and slightly comic , an upended truck sliding to a stop only inches from the land mine the driver is goggling at . There's the expectable slow motion as some of the artifacts explode . And the ambient sound shuts off while we follow the trajectories of a couple of particularly important bullets whizzing through the air in slow motion . I'm not sure whether such obvious tricks belong in this kind of movie or not . The script itself , willy nilly , provides plenty of comic moments without the director's having force fed additional laughs to the viewer . If anything , comedic intent at the wrong time drains incidents of some of their dramatic value . The movie paints the Americans as greedy and unethical , maybe , but fundamentally good , pausing in their quest for pelf long enough to rescue damsels in distress , and some guys as well . And it criticizes American policy in the war's wake . George H . W . Bush encouraged Iraqi rebels and then he didn't help them . In light of current events , one is compelled to wonder whether it was such a bad idea to stay out of it . The movie criticizes American policy by seeming to argue only that we should have gone ahead , taken Bagdhad , booted Saddam out , and installed a democracy . In that order . At this point it's beginning to look less like " Kelly's Heroes " and a little like " Rambo . " The story has one of our guys captured by Saddam's forces and tortured in an unspeakable way in an underground bunker . But then the plot deals us the joker we could never have expected was still in the deck . One of the Iraqi interrogators , in a polished performance combining malevolence with an impassive but genuine curiosity , quizzes the American prisoner concerning the morality of the war - - and the answers aren't easy to come up with . We can't respond with easily available schema about " you and your kind . " The scene is presented without much subtlety . It's obviously posed . And yet it may be the most important and memorable in the film , lifting it out of the action / comedy genre that laid claim to American screens through much of the 1980s and 1990s . It may be obvious but it may be necessary too . Its very starkness may be required to penetrate the firewall we've constructed around our conception of the world as one of Biblical good and evil . Clooney's a good actor , along the lines of Clark Gable . Masculine enough not to be off-putting to men , while ( I guess ) handsome enough to appeal to women . Interesting enough to have a beer and an argument with . Recommended ? Yes . It ought to satisfy anyone whose movie values encompass more than video games .
Ambitious , successful TV-docudrama .	The story is familiar enough in its outline that I'll pretty much skip it . Basically , Don Cheadle's character , a hotel manager in Rwanda during the genocide , manages to save most of his family and more than a thousand Hutus who would otherwise have become victims in the slaughter . It's sometimes reminiscent of parts of " The Killing Fields " and " Salvador , " but it's more modestly done . No grand , sweeping shots of ten thousand extras ; no repetitive shots of machetes hacking up innocent people . It's the story of one ordinary - - well , maybe extraordinary - - guy who wheedles , bribes , and blackmails until he gets his charges out into neighboring Tanzania . Yet , though we see little of it , the horror hangs palpably in the atmosphere . Cheadle's character is driving a van full of supplies back to his hotel in the middle of the night and the van begins to bump and lurch on a suddenly rough road . Cheadle gets out and discovers he's been driving over piles of corpses which cover the road as far ahead as he can see . The UN forces are present but almost ( not quite ) impotent . I lost track of who was doing all the killing - - there is the army , the rebels , various factions - - it hardly matters . The Hutus are killing the Tutsi children so as to wipe out the next generation . It's difficult to tell how this differs much from the Serbs raping rival women in order to impregnate them and produce a next generation that is at least half-Serbian . Perhaps half a million people were killed in Rwanda in 1994 . The rivers and waterfalls were choked with naked and mutilated bodies . And little attention was paid by most of us , just as there is little attention being paid to events in Darfur as I write this . Our general view of human nature is that we are flawed but perfectible . Maybe we're just flawed . Maybe what we need is a signal of surrender , the kind dogs have , in which the loser rolls over on his back and the victor straddles him , looks around , and growls . Alas we have no such signal . The hand of the Intelligent Designer shook . Cheadle's performance is better than just good . He's VERY good . He darts about wearing the same expression , wheeling and dealing , being reasonable , until we think that's all there is to him . Until there is a scene with a corrupt general who swigs out of a bottle of single malt scotch and muses about his visit to Scotland . " Good golf . I wonder if I will ever visit there again . Do you think so ? " Cheadle , meanwhile , sweat pouring down his face , has been frantically stacking bottles of scotch in a crate to bribe the general , paying no attention , and he replies unthinkingly , " No , " then looks up and adds quickly , " I mean there are many things I believe we should all do in the future . " The scene ends with Cheadle's man who embraces realpolitik finally losing his temper and shouting wide-eyed at the general that some day there will be an accounting for all this and who , if not Cheadle , will be around to testify for the general . The transformation of the character from polite and subservient to angry and threatening is shocking . And it is hard to believe that Cheadle could have been one of the undercover Narcs in " Traffic . " He's exceptional . His wife , Sophie Okonedo , is compellingly beautiful in a most ordinary kind of way with her plump pouting lips , her Egyptian eyes , and her narrow-shouldered vulnerable frame . But , really , all the performances are pretty good . If there were a temptation to turn the white folks into villains , it was successfully resisted . I'm not sure - - I'll have to look it up later - - but I don't believe the distinction between Tutsi and Hutu was created by European colonials . Probably the measurements and all that took place , and perhaps the laying on of hands ceremony , but if I remember the Hutu and Tutsi spoke different languages and were of different somatotypes to begin with . Not that it matters much . The movie is both gripping and instructive . A great candidate for showing in classes on international affairs and social change . Throw it into a philosophy class while you're at it . Let's see what they make out of human nature .
Suicide by airplane .	There's a certain preposterous quality in the thinking of guys like Sam Bicke . A failed salesman and failed family man , his loathing comes to focus on President Richard M . Nixon , whom he intends to get rid of by forcing an airliner to fly into the White House . The thinking is preposterous because the rest of us - - well , MOST of the rest of us - - can't connect the dots between personal failure and bad luck on the one hand and eliminating a powerful figure on the other . We can understand a man murdering his wife or the other way around . We can understand murdering an old friend . We usually kill people whose opinions we value , who are in a position to hurt us . But why kill a complete stranger ? Richard M . Nixon or John Lennon ? The movie tries to explain it for us . Sam Bicke ( Sean Penn ) is a loser who missed even the caboose of life's gravy train . He failed and Nixon seemed to have all the power and Sam Bicke took out his self loathing on the President . That strikes me as too glib . Why did David Chapman kill John Lennon ? In some ways it's better to look at acts like these and treat them as suicides . They've been called Samsonic suicides because they resemble in some ways the suicide of Samson , the guy who killed himself but managed to destroy a temple in the process . The movie itself is a downer , not because of the talent involved . Sean Penn , as he ages , is beginning to look a little like Harvey Keitel . And he underacts effectively in this role . The supporting players are very good too , though Naomi Watts has very little to do . The pistol that Sam Bicke buys , which he uses to kill his good-natured dog before offing a number of people on the airplane , doesn't resound thunderously . It pops . The perfect sound for the gun of a man who is almost completely impotent . This failed salesman could be the Willy Loman of our day . In fact , the pitiful way in which he tries to ingratiate himself with barely interested people of influence probably owes something to Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman . The self immolation is as powerful today as it was sixty years ago because we all know something of how it feels . Attention must be paid . A case study of a madman whose rationality is as counterintuitive and as convoluted as that of Mobius strip cubed .
Frothy comedy .	If you liked " Pillow Talk " you'll like " Lover Come Back . " The two movies have the same principal cast and similar stories involving Doris Day mistaking a hated rival , Hudson , for an innocent naif . Tony Randall has the same role as Hudson's less magnetic sidekick . Thelma Ritter and her volcanic hangover are , alas , absent . There are , of course , some differences , this being the cinematic equivalent of musical variations on a theme . I think Rock Hudson may be subject to more humiliation here than in the original . The original had him getting plastered by Thelma Ritter and later having his apartment hideously overdecorated . This one has him running around New York's streets naked except for a woman's fur coat . The story isn't as tidily plotted as the original , in which everything is properly seated . And the ending of this film shows a certain weakening of innovation . When in doubt , resort to a frantic but senseless chase or get everybody drunk . That aside - - and it's a minor carp - - it's a pretty funny movie , at times a very good comedy . The running gag of the colored explosions in Randall's face are perfectly timed and edited . Of course it reflects the social values of the early 1950s - - Day must remain chaste until marriage - - but so what ? It's an apt subject for a comedy when you think about it . Rock Hudson is tall , handsome , and , yes , masculine . Tony Randall , the latent heterosexual , is funny as hell with his goggle-eyed fear and wonderment . Miss Doris Kappelhoff - - aus Zinzinatti - - was no longer a spring chicken in 1961 , but wow , is she perky and sexy . Buns of iron , and the way she walks ! What's delightful about her performance is that she seems completely unaware of the nonverbal signals she's sending out or incapable of controlling them , mindlessly radiating them , like one of those clanging , blinking warning signals at a railroad crossing . The plot's too silly to bother with - - mixed identities , but it works alright . It's charm has an enduring quality , so see it if you can .
A History Lesson	Are history books written by the winners , or what ? Adolph Galland , an ace fighter pilot of the war who flew Me109s with Mickey Mouse painted on the fuselage , was one of the many technical advisers on this film and he objected strongly to a couple of its features . He was irritated by the last scene in which Goering appears , departing by train , and is saluted by two officers . One salutes Goering in the approved military style . The other , Major Fohn , who more or less plays Galland , renders Goering a Hitler-style salute . Galland stomped up and down . It never happened . Under those circumstances Goering would have received nothing but military salutes . But Guy Hamilton , the director , bent the rules because to the Fohn character , who despised Goering , the Hitler salute was the equivalent of a finger salute . Galland was also angered by the whole thrust of the film , beginning with its title , " The Battle of Britain , " which the Germans lost . According to Galland and many other German officers , it wasn't a battle and nobody lost it . It was a sensible attempt to bring England to the bargaining table and when it failed for technical reasons , the bombing attacks were dropped and other means were tried . Of course if Germany had won the war , who knows ? Galland might have written the script and it might have turned out to be a " battle " after all , only this time the Germans would have come out on top . THAT hypothetical history book would have been written by a different winner . There really isn't enough space to get into strategic bombing campaigns in World War II . The Germans ' weren't worth the expense . Maybe ours was , beginning a few years later , because we tried the same thing - - bombing both cities and military targets without fighter cover and suffered appalling losses , so severe in fact that the Americans were forced to suspend them until long-range fighter escorts were available . We didn't seem to have learned much from German experience during the battle of Britain . The movie isn't bad at all . Sketchy , true , but there is a gallimaufry of characters , many of whom we can only tell apart because they were famous faces above their uniform collars . Sometimes , as in the case of Sussannah York , they only wear half a uniform , which is pleasant enough . The flight scenes are spectacular . The airplanes are mostly flown by pilots in the Spanish Air Force and were a rich source of amusement to many experienced observers . They could not follow commands in the air . They had the reckless disposition of racing car drivers and the discipline of a gang of juvenile delinquents . The special effects , which are of extreme importance to a movie like this , were a little disappointing . So poorly thought out , in some cases , that a viewer might wince . Didn't anybody see the final film before it was released ? When there is an explosion a mile or two away from the camera , the sound doesn't arrive simultaneous with the sight . You see , sound travels more SLOWLY than light , fellas , so it reaches you later . You must have watched a thunderstorm with lightning at some point in your lives . And a high-explosive bomb doesn't land in an open field and produce a fireball . It produces a big bang , a cloud of dust , and a hearty Hi Ho , Silver . And when machine gun bullets puncture the thin aluminum skin of an airplane , they don't ricochet all over the place with a lot of PTEW PTEW PTEWs on the sound track . I don't know what they sound like in passing through a thin sheet of metal that any normal human could kick a hole through , but on a firing range when they penetrate a canvas target they make a shockingly loud THWACK . I realize that these are minor things but that's exactly the point . They are so small , so obvious , that had any thought been given to sound effects they could easily have been corrected . I enjoyed the score though . The music , mostly by Ron Goodwin , is upbeat for the Germans at the beginning . And good use is made of William Walton's " Battle in the Air " for the climactic encounter between Brits and Germans . That last fight is almost wordless . And in fact some of the most moving scenes in the film are without dialog . When York's husband is wounded , she has just had an encounter with a man whose face is horribly scarred and distorted by a fire in his Hurricane . " Is Colin badly burned ? " she asks anxiously . And Kenneth More simply stand before her without expression . That non-answer contains more information than a thousand fulsome reassurances . And later , after the last exhausting air battle , we see the German pilots , so full of life and eager for action at the start , sitting silently at the dinner table , glancing at the conspicuously empty chair of a fallen comrade . There's a good deal of taste and skill shown in this movie . ( Olivier seems unable to turn in a bad performance . ) It might have been better .
Entertaining Comedy of Manners	The English title , " Perfect Strangers , " was changed to " Vacation From Marriage " for its USA distribution . It's amazing that it ever was finished . Aside from a good deal of trouble concerning the script , it was filmed in 1944 when there was a shortage of sets and equipment and everything else in England except myriad Buzz Bombs . The story had been done before . Two stodgy spouses undergo some sort of traumatic experience and find their marriage improved as a result . Here , the spouses are the stuffy and boring Robert Donat ( " The Thirty Nine Steps " ) and the whimpering hypochondriacal Deborah Kerr . The traumatic event is a three-year separation for war service - - he in the Navy and she a Wren . During the separation they change by force of circumstances . Donat shaves his mustache and has a fling with a blond . Kerr , under the guidance of the fey Glynis Johns , has her hair redone and acquires self confidence . When they are brought back to England to spend their leave together , each liberated spouse still carries the image of the stultifying other . They didn't even kiss good-bye at their departure . Kerr , afraid to enter their apartment , calls him hysterically and demands a divorce . They meet at a nearby pub , The Coach and Horses , and each is surprised but wary at the change in the other . They flirt , quarrel , part , and make up . It ends happily with an embrace in front of the window of their flat , overlooking a blitzed London overhung with barrage balloons , a fresh new morning . It's all very well done . There aren't any belly laughs but a viewer may be forgiven for smiles of recognition at the minor ironies of life that are on full display here . Donat is his smooth self . Kerr is winsome and girlish , slightly wall eyed , her voice slightly quivering , and completely winning , so innocent in appearance and demeanor that it would be obscene to think of her legs . I couldn't help it so I did it anyway . You'll probably enjoy this . The script isn't high flown . This isn't Shakespeare ; it's everyday life . But all the characters are precise and somewhat elegant in their speech . The Brits always sound a little more elegant than the rest of us .
Good Action / Thriller	There's nothing much original in the plot , and there isn't much in the way of character development , but this is a first-rate thriller with some excellent performances and fine direction . Schlesinger has put the film together in such a way that there isn't a dull moment . Even though some of the moments themselves might not make a heck of a lot of sense . Olivier's Szell has been living off his diamonds for years but has no idea what they are worth in today's market ? But so what ? The need to find that information takes Olivier to New York's diamond market where the stores and streets are full of Jews and two of them recognize Olivier for the monster he is . The scene involves an old lady being hit by a car , a throat slashing , and a hair-breadth escape by Olivier , not to mention a couple of amusing scenes in the shops themselves . The script has taken Olivier on an unnecessary and dangerous trip , and Schlesinger has made the absolute most out of the scene . This happens repeatedly . A bomb is hidden inside a doll . Just before it blows up and kills a number of people , the clock inside the doll stops its loud ticking and the doll slowly opens its eyes . Why ? I mean , what has the time bomb got to do with the eyeballs ? Again , no matter . The incident adds to the tension and that's its point . Then there is the famous torture scene , in which Dustin Hoffman is trapped in a chair and his teeth are finagled with by Olivier , who is playing a Nazi dentist . " Hmm . That's quite a cavity you have there . You should take better care of your teeth . " And the whining buzz of the unseen drill when Olivier tests it . Man , if you dislike visits to the dentist , you'll find this scene excruciating . Schlesinger even has one of the Nazi thugs turn away . The scene didn't bother me that much because I am never afraid of the dentist unless I am in his office but I can still sympathize . The directorial manipulation doesn't always work out the way we expect perhaps . Dustin Hoffman is shown running multiple times , with occasional quick inserts of Olympic runners like Jesse Owens . And when he takes off down deserted streets pursued on foot by a couple of shoe-clad heavies we half expect him to fly like Mercury , yet he's barely able to outlast William Devane . Dustin Hoffman's performance is more than just good . When he's experiencing fear or anguish he can really make us feel it . And Olivier is superb , with his shining pate and go-anywhere accent . He even gives the sadistic Nazi some dignity . When Hoffman has him at gunpoint and is forcing him to eat his own diamonds , Olivier balks after managing to swallow one or two and says firmly , " No more . You'll have to shoot me . " There are a couple of loose ends in the script . We hear more than once that Hoffman is unwilling to face facts . It sounds like a set up for some tragic flaw that will get him in trouble later . But it doesn't . He seems to face all the facts as he becomes aware of them . And there is a good deal of attention paid to the father of Hoffman and Roy Scheider . Evidently the guy was caught up in the McCarthy witch hunt and killed himself for some reason . Hoffman may be writing his master's thesis on the incident - - it's not entirely clear . But it doesn't matter anyway because it has nothing to do with the plot . I have to mention the location shooting and the photography because both are so well done . The isolated abandoned farmhouse towards the end , sitting atop a hill that is bare except for a few leafless wintry trees and the sad remnants of last summer's sunflowers , it all evokes Poe's misty mid-region of Weir . I've kind of picked on this movie for its weaknesses but I don't want to give the impression that it's a failure because it is definitely not . It does precisely the job it sets out to do .
Involving murder mystery .	Once you accept the basic premise that psychoanalysis " works , " you wind up with a pretty good , thoroughly Hitchcockian murder mystery . Not one of his comic thrillers like " The Man Who Knew Too Much , " and not a gloomy " The Wrong Man " either . More like " Shadow of a Doubt " but less subtle and more theory dependent . Everything moves along normally at first , but then the character of the central figure turns out to have a secret and he falls apart . Instead of a detective like Sherlock Holmes tracking down clues - - the ash of a trichinopoly cigar or something - - there is a psychiatrist , Ingrid Bergman , unraveling the mystery of the new doctor , Gregory Peck , who takes over the management of the rather classy funny farm at which she works - - Green Manors . It doesn't take long to find out that Peck may be a doctor , but he's also an amnesic and a fake , and that he may be crazy as a bedbug and a murderer to boot . With the help of her elderly friend and mentor , Dr . Brulov ( Michael Chekhov ) , Bergman sets about unraveling the enigma of Peck's true identity by using the traditional tools of psychoanalysis - - the analysis of his phobias and dreams . The dream we see depicted on the screen is pretty good , too ; it's designed by Salvador Dali and it looks it . I think Dali might have been a little crazy himself . Psychoanalysis , though , has been - - not " discredited . " But maybe consigned to a particular historical period - - turn-of-the-century Europe . The propulsive force behind neurosis and anxiety was some forbidden sexual act ( or impulse , even if stifled ) . My guess : That's not our chief problem today . We'd be better off with Adler than Freud - - " it's not about sex , it's about power . " Be that as it may , given the premise , the story is still a bit confused . True that Peck is haunted by his accidental killing of his brother in childhood , but that's a canard because it has nothing to do with the murder story . But the plot has a strong climax . Just when everything seems neatly wrapped up , the conundrum solved , wrapped up in gift packaging and accompanied by a psychiatrist's monster bill , a slip of the villain's tongue reveals a great big new complication . Not a Freudian slip , just your ordinary parapraxis . Ingrid Berman is a beautiful woman , large boned and with generous features , but girlish in a coy way . Hitchcock was personally attracted to her for the rest of his life and never made mean remarks about her as he did with some of his other actresses - - Vera Miles , Eva Marie Saint . Gregory Peck is startlingly young and bony here , and although he handles it well , it's not a Gregory Peck part . He doesn't radiate sincerity . He has to play a character that is confused and weak . Weak not like his General Savage in " Twelve O'Clock High " , but weak in a feminine fashion . He faints several times , drops tea cups , his eyes bulge with shock . The laughs are provided by Michael Chekhov , the bespectacled , brilliant Russian shrink who smokes a pipe and makes wisecracks about his patients , his friends , the police , women in general , everybody in general . I liked him the moment he was introduced - - entering a room , removing his fedora to reveal a reckless and upright cowlick of white hair that must have half-filled his hat . " You are amnesic . You don't know who you are . You don't know if you are comink or goink . But you DO know that Freud is ' hooey ' ! Hmmph - - wiseguy . " In Peck's dream , he skis at a place called - - he can't quite remember the name - - Angel Valley ? No - - GABRIEL VALLEY ! I skied at a place called Heavenly Valley in California . I wonder if that's where the writer got the idea for the name . Well - - I define " skiing " most generously . I spent all my time gracefully gliding downhill backwards and filling in spill holes . Saw this as a child , as a matter of fact , in the Mayfair Theater . Scared the pants off me . Especially Miklos Rosza's fully blown , lush , romantic , symphonic , and thoroughly spooky score . Nobody had heard a theramin before . And then there's that bloody red BANG at the end .
Crash survivors battle Ur-shrinks .	This is a kind of likable , fast , black-and-white , Grand Hotel , airplane-in-peril movie . You see , there are eleven people of varied background who board a passenger airplane , which crashes in the Amazon jungle , and only five people can be flown out when the plane is repaired and takes off again . Of the passengers , the two pilots are robust no-nonsense types , there is a little kid , an elderly couple , a mobster , a murderer being flown back to be hanged , a drunken nasty detective , and a rich young couple made up of a nice young lady and a spoiled guy who turns into a cowardly lout . Oh - - and there's a whore with a heart of gold . Just an average group of a dozen or so people you might pick out at random from the streets of Los Angeles . I suppose you think you know the trajectory of the plot . Well , in this case it so happens that all the bad guys survive and fly to safety , while all the moral self-sacrificing embodiments of noble middle-class values are left to be tortured and have their heads shrunk by the Jivaro natives . Just kidding . Actually it turns out pretty much as you'd expect but there are interesting twists and turns along the way . There's nothing much to be said about the performances . The characters are cardboard . The picture is studio bound , meaning that no jungle ever looked quite so well laid out . The end is predictable . The intelligent design behind it looks suspiciously like Darwinism . But it's an unpretentious and enjoyable old movie . Considering the budget , it's nicely done . The scenes in the passenger cabin during the storm are particularly neat - - junk falling all over the place , tanks of gas breaking loose and rolling about , a steward sucked out the open door while saving the kid . The old professor gets the details of Jivaro head shrinking accurately . They were mean folks . Not the meanest though - - that accolade generally goes to the Aymara of Chile - - but mean enough . It all flows along smoothly to its sad but inevitable end . Worth seeing .
You Can't Go Wrong Here .	Sometimes silly , more often outrageously funny , and always propelled , it's a relatively well-plotted comedy , with Charlie Sheen and Cary Elwes competing for Valeria Golena and for the status of Top Gun in a Navy fighter squadron . If you've seen any of Jim Abraham's - - or Abraham's and Zuckerman's - - films before , no detailed description of the film or its comedic style is necessary , or even possible . There's a good deal of slapstick , which I'm inclined to overlook , but the gags are sometimes elegant and extremely funny . They often depend on taking figures of speech , or cinematic conventions , and interpreting them literally . Two brief examples . An admiral takes a pratfall . Aide : " Are you alright , Admiral ? " Admiral ( Loyd Bridges ) : " Allright ? Of course I'm alright . Why ? What have you heard ? " A patient is being urgently wheeled down a hospital corridor , flanked by the usual coterie of staff in scrubs . The patient's worried friend asks : " Can you save him ? " Doctor : " I don't know . I'm not a very good doctor . ( To the patient ) Now this may hurt . ( Bends down and bites the patient's nose savagely . ) " I don't want to go too far with this . There are sketches that parody all kind of popular movies . The main target is " Top Gun , " but we also have non sequiturs thrust in from " Rocky " and who knows how many others , many of which I couldn't identify . If you don't laugh out loud , you should see somebody about it .
A Chaplin Delight .	This feature stands alongside " The Gold Rush " and " Modern Times " as among Chaplin's best . If it lacks the exoticism and technological sophistication of the other two , it has some marvelously funny set pieces . Chaplin , as the Tramp , gets mixed up with a pickpocket while visiting the circus . Mistaken by the police for the criminal , he runs into the center of a clown act in the center ring and , without intending to , wows the audience in a way the clowns never did . His next escape attempt leads him into a magician's act in which he finds himself , to wild applause , frantically trying to stuff various small animals - - doves , ducks , piglets - - back into top hats on a table but finds himself swimming in the little beasts . There is a scene , lasting only a few minutes , in which Chaplin imitates a mechanical man that is about as funny as anything he's done . The inevitable sentiment is damped down . There is a circus girl that Chaplin falls for , but she is attracted to a newcomer , a debonair tightrope walker . It doesn't interfere with the comedy . There's no point in going on too long about the plot . It's mostly a series of set pieces . But the plots never meant too much in Chaplin's films from this period anyway . Recommended without qualification .
Strangely involving minor film .	There's nothing much to the story . A young woman steals some money from the dreary Vermont supermarket where she works , decides to run away to Florida where he has dreams of attending school with her friend Julie , and encounters an odd couple on the highway . If you remember the elderly couple from " Rosemary's Baby , " you have some idea of what these two are like . Bill has a comical face and is retired from the Army . Sandra is an ex stripper now become a truckstop whore , although we don't find this out at once . They're affectionate , helpful , and full of common sense . They more or less adopt the girl , Alice , and promise to give her a ride in their elaborate RV , although they are not driving " directly " to Florida . This is where the film could have gone one-hundred-percent wrong . All the film makers had to do was turn the elderly couple into the personification of evil . They would take the virginal Alice ( handcuffed to the bed or whatever ) and sell her body to any greaseball driver who has a lot of money and likes rough sex . ( Alice would have had a heck of a time escaping , with lots of aborted attempts , before the final shootout . ) But , no . The couple really IS pretty nice , and Alice is far from virginal . Alice overhears Sandra with a customer , asks about the business , and tries to turn a trick on her own . Bill prevents anything from happening and insists she do the job right if she's going to do it at all . They don't talk her into it . They guide her . Alice makes several hundred dollars , which is several hundred dollars more than she had when she met the couple . Bill and Sandra keep her money in the safe where customers aren't going to find it . Alice misunderstands . She doesn't find whoring very pleasant work , and she thinks she'll never be paid off because every time she asks to be dropped off , Sandra responds with , " What ? Not here , honey . Not in the middle of nowhere . " However , after she is talked into handing her gun over to Sandra , the couple give her the money she wants and rather lovingly release her to continue her trip to Florida . You know what I found the most tragic moment in the film ? It had nothing to do with prostitution or thievery . Alice has been expecting to room with her friend Julie after she arrives in Miami . Julie is after all a legitimate student . But when Alice calls her friend from someplace in Alabama to assure her she's on her way but will be late , Julie hesitates and says , " Well - - my mother doesn't think you should room with us . And to tell you the truth , my roommate isn't cool on it either . I invited you down , sure , but I thought it was just like a visit for a week or something . Go back to Milford , Alice " There is a long silence before Alice hangs up . Only one shot is fired ( a few white frames of film ) and no one is hit . Tears appear only once . Nobody slugs anybody else . No car explodes in a fireball . No cop chases them down the Interstate . The direction is occasionally clumsy . Too much cross-cutting between Sandra trying to disarm Alice and Alice's hand holding the wobbling pistol . There is hardly any musical score . There is brief male and female nudity and it's awkward , as it's probably supposed to be . Alice isn't unattractive but she is not babalicious either . She sports Asiatic eyes , a kind of robust version of Molly Parker . The cinematography looks cheap and the colors are washed out . The direction is a straightforward narrative , with a few illuminating flashbacks . Nothing is wasted . And it was all evidently shot around Danbury , Connecticut . The city sticks in my mind because I drove through it after one of its floods and remember the cars caked with a film of mud all the way up to the door handles . I don't know exactly What Alice Found . ( I dread even THINKING that the answer to the riddle is that " she found herself . " ) The acting isn't bad at all . Judith Ivey is better than that . It's definitely worth seeing , a quiet , orderly film that treats the audience like adults .
Fast and zany parody of policiers .	I have to hand it to the Zuckers and Abrahams . This is really funny , a send-up of every crime movie you've ever seen , something about a plot to assassinate Queen Elizabeth during her visit to Los Angeles . It borrows from every place . There's a scene lifted directly from Don Siegel's " Telefon . " Some of the first-person narration quotes Raymond Chandler : " Her hair was the color of gold in old paintings . " Most of the jokes are original , though , and half loony . Some don't work - - a car pulls into a parking space at the docks and knocks a screaming man into the water . Others are so outlandish as to be almost surreal . In the opening scene , Detective Nordberg ( a depressing but still effective O . J . Simpson ) creeps up , gun drawn , to a door behind which a dozen hoodlums are negotiating the purchase of a horde of dope . He takes a deep breath and kicks against the door . The door doesn't swing open . Instead , Simpson's foot crashes through the panel and he must extract it and fiddle with the knob . By the time he gets the door opens and announces that everyone is under arrest , the gang has their own guns loaded , cocked , and aimed at him . They shoot him six times . Instead of slumping to the deck , he caroms around the walls , shouting in pain when he bunks his head against some pipes , when he puts his hand on a red hot wood stove , when he leans against a wall of fresh paint , when a window slams down on his hand , when he steps into a bear trap , and so on . Simpson winds up in the hospital . While preparing to visit him , Lt . Frank Drebin ( Leslie Nielson ) asks how he's doing . Nielson's boss , George Kennedy , tells him solemnly , " The doctors say he has a chance of living , though there's only a ten percent chance of that . " In other words , there is a ten percent chance that Simpson has a fifty percent chance of living . To put it more simply , that's or p = . 05 . I'd be happy to clarify this further by using base-8 math but I don't know how . The doctors tending Simpson tell his wife , " We think we can save your husband's arm . Where would you like it sent ? " I don't think I want to go any farther with the plot because it's really insignificant , just a frame to hang a lot of jokes on . And I don't want to give any more of the jokes away . Well , one more . The voices tell me to do it . Nielson makes a harrowing escape across the facade of a tall building , hanging on to decorative human figures as he goes , breaking off the penis of one of the male figures , before he crashes through a window and into the bedroom of a half-dressed shrieking woman , and dizzily brandishes the broken-off tool . The mayor charges him with " searching without a warrant , breaking and entering , arson , and assault with a concrete dildo . " You'll have to see the movie to get the rest of them . It's ribald and hilarious .
Icon of Vernacular Culture .	If you haven't seen this one , you've not only missed the movie itself but the irregular and irreverent allusions to it that crop up in other sources from time to time . You NEED to see this one , in the sense that you need to know that George Washington was our first president . The story of a naive girl ( Ruby Keeler in her debut ) who joins the chorus of a musical comedy being directed by a taskmaster ( Warner Baxter ) , and when the star falls down and breaks a leg , Keeler , with the support of other cast members , including the disabled star herself ( Bebe Daniels ) , is plucked from obscurity and sent out on stage to replace her . " You're going out there a nobody , but you've got to come back a STAR ! " Daniels tells her . If you're able to dismiss that line as a hoary cliché , it's because this is the movie that introduced it to audiences . And the script is loaded with such felicities . Anytime Annie ( Ginger Rogers ) only said " no " once , and that was when she didn't hear the question . And , " It must have been tough on your mother , not having any children . " It's the depths of the depression and the show MUST succeed . Everything is riding on it so everyone must work himself and herself to the point of exhaustion . Ruby Keeler , not used to clomping around repeatedly during the demanding dance numbers , collapses gracefully on the floor . Warner Baxter , the director , smokes constantly , scowls while listening , waves his hands , cries out for the rehearsal to stop , shouts in a quavering voice that you've got to give it MORE , you've got to give it everything you HAVE ! The poor guy has been though one nervous breakdown and is now , his doc tells him , headed for a heart attack . Ruby Keeler as the nice girl catapulted into stardom is unforgettable . She has the eyes of a Keane child - - absolutely huge , missing only the glistening tear trickling down one cheek . She's winsome and charming and can dance and sing about as well as you can . At her most inspired moments she seems to be stomping cockroaches with her tap shoes . She does however reach her apotheosis on the stage during the first night's performance . The staging involved goes beyond Baroque into the upper reaches of the Rococco . The dozens of dancers each carry placards which , when displayed side-by-side to the audience , present a vast panorama of gaudy , naughty , bawdy 42nd Street in New York . The scale of the display changes so insidiously that the visual experience becomes trippy . At one point we seem to be looking up at a huge skyscraper aiming at the stars , and then the life-sized juvenile lead ( Dick Powell ) and Keeler appear at the top , smiling at us and singing , and we realize the skyscraper is only a smallish cardboard simulacrum lying flat on its back . The camera is used in an overhead shot of dozens of women dancers who move their arms and legs in such a way as to resemble excessively willful flower petals . The accommodating camera also takes us on a theme park tour between the knees of the chorus girls with their legs spread in the second ballet position . There is a kind of " Slaughter on Tenth Avenue " vignette of a crime passionelle in which a guy has an argument with his girl , she jumps out the window onto a rooftop , he follows her to the street and stabs her to death , while Dick Powell in the window above shakes his head in amused resignation and takes another drink . The dramatic moments are among the funniest . It's easy to make fun of this movie - - mainly because it IS silly . And yet , despite that , the director , Loyd Bacon , draws us into the effort it takes to put a musical comedy together . And it's an ensemble effort , not limited to the tale of Ruby Keeler . We get repeated shots of the stage manager doing his thing , and Jerry , the rehearsal pianist , fast asleep with his head on the piano during breaks . In spite of its own throw-away quality the movie captures some of the suffering and anxiety , and the solidarity that the superordinate goal generates . Some of the cast sacrifice their own shots at stardom and give it to Ruby Keeler because she is most likely to turn the show into a success , thus proving that no chorus girl is an island . See it - - and see it now .
Mature Audiences Only	An affectionate look at the Golden Age of porn movies , from the late 1970s to , say , the early 1980s . The cast list is filled with familiar names who deliver the goods with expected skill . Philip Seymour Hoffman is unusually fine but then they're almost all outstanding . No need to carry on about the content . It's not prurient . There's very little nudity and the simulated sex is not as exploitative as it is in many far less ambitious and thoughtful erotic thrillers - - " Body of Evidence , " for instance , or " Masquerade . " I'll give an example of some of the acting talent on display here . Julianne Moore is a splendid performer who has become a familiar name not because of her appearance - - she's hardly gorgeous by Hollywood standards - - but because of the subtlety with which she uses her instrument . In " Boogie Nights " she plays the wife of Burt Reynolds , a kind of surrogate mother to the cast and crew of the flicks Burt turns out and Moore acts in . There is an important scene in which she and Mark Wahlberg , as a tyro with a huge schlong , make love on screen for the first time . He's a nervous wreck , but she's gentle and real and makes him feel less anxious simply by being accommodating . And then the scene is filmed . ( One take . Two would cost too much money . ) And Moore adopts the character she's playing in the skin flick . In her filmed conversation with Wahlman she strips herself of her natural talent and becomes the kind of fake with the artificial voice that populates the skin flicks of the 70s . She acts like a non-actress . The porn film that used to be shown in theaters goes out of style in the 1980s . Films are now videotaped and Burt Reynolds , who yearns to make a " real film " that he will be " remembered for , " balks at the change . Neither Reynolds nor anyone else seems to realize that the social world they've built is as evanescent , as friable , as the disco music that serves as its accompaniment . Everything goes downhill , undone not so much by prudery as by properties inherent in the occupation , the Zeitgeist , and , in fact , in human nature - - political correctness , technology , coke , celebrity , materialism , ego , hoary feminist inevitabilities , and the general decadence to which social movements are prone . The direction ? Forget that this is a movie about sex and watch the scene towards the end in which Wahlberg and two of his friends visit the house of a rich rock star with the intention of robbing him of all the money he is said to keep in his safe . Things begin to go wrong . The rock star is high as a kite , he has a big black associate armed with two pistols , the pointless electric guitars and percussion from the stereo fill the air with din , an unexpected Chinese guest is setting off firecrackers and each bang makes the three would-be thieves jump in their seats . There is a generous amount of tension in this scene and it would do justice to any more " respectable " movie . In the end , things have quieted down and have become quietly peaceful and quietly quiet . The movie's not a tragedy but the story of a tough and uncertain journey through particularly turbulent times , which not all the participants manage to survive . It's pretty good .
Fast , often hilarious comedy .	Preston Sturges , who wrote and directed this headlong parody of small-town life and war-time patriotism , was a man of multiple talents . Take his direction , for example . He pulls of this outrageous stunt without any razzle dazzle at all . Any modern comedy would blast us with funny music and shots that last about as long as a lightning strike . But Sturges ' takes tend to be long , though not in the least leisurely . A contentious couple walking down the street may be followed in one take for half a block , turn a corner , and be followed for another half block . The story concerns mainly Trudy Kockenlocker ( a tempestuous Betty Hutton ) and her suitor , the good-hearted but goofy Norval Jones ( Eddie Bracken ) . Norval has been in love with Trudy for years , even taking the same high school classes so he could be near her . " I didn't mind the cooking , " he explains , " but the sewing . . . . " Norval would be in the army himself but every time he tries to enlist he becomes so nervous that he stutters and shakes , his blood pressure soars , and he sees black spots in front of his eyes . After a wild night on the town with some soldiers about to be shipped out , Trudy sobers up the next morning to find herself married but unable to remember the name she used or the soldier she married . Pregnancy adds to the problem . Her young sister , Diana Lynn , advises her that she needs a husband - - fast . There's always Norval , ready to do anything for her . She prompts the innocent , unknowing Norval into a proposal , which takes him several minutes to sputter out , but compelled by her conscience , Trudy tries gently to spill the beans . She really shouldn't marry him , she tells Norval , because she made a big mistake the night of the dance . " What mistake ? I thought you had a lot of fun ! " Trudy : " Well , I did - - in a way - - but some kinds of fun last longer than others , if you know what I mean . " The more Trudy explains , the more excited and frightened Neurotic Norval becomes . He stutters to the point of unintelligibility , occasionally interrupting himself to slam a fist into his palm and shout , " The SPOTS ! " She and Norval decide to plunge ahead with the marriage anyway . They visit the Justice of the Peace in a nearby town and Norval poses as the soldier husband that Trudy can't remember . Norval is outfitted in the only army uniform available , a left-over deal from World War I . His collar insignia show the Marine Corps on one side and the Cavalry on the other . They must make up a name for him - - Ignatz Raskywasky - - which neither can pronounce . It ends with Norval in jail . I don't want to run out of space but this is one hilarious skewering of ordinary middle American life . The dialog is often corrosive . " Daughters ! " , Trudy's father ( William Demarest ) complains . " They hang around the house like Spanish moss until they shame you into an early grave . " Norval's lawyer . " Norval , I'm a lawyer . I WORK as a lawyer . I'm ready to sue anybody , anywhere , at any time . " And , " You haven't asked my advice , and I'm not going to give any . But if I were you I'd get out of town fast and hide someplace . " Trudy's sister ( Diana Lynn ) tells Demarest : " Can't you think of something ? You're always having bright ideas . " Demarest : " Listen , Zipperpuss , some day they're going to find your hair ribbon and an ax someplace , and that's all . " One of the most mirthful movies of its decade .
Charlo at the top of his game .	Charlie Chaplin made some extremely funny shorts but of his longer films , this is one of the best , along with " The Gold Rush " and " Modern Times . " Two stories are woven together . One is Charlie's on-again off-again friendship with a wealthy drunk . The guy has a case of multiple personality . When drunk he showers Charlie with friendship and gifts . When he's sober he doesn't recognize Charlie at all . The second story involves a pretty , blind flower girl who , given certain distances , angles , and lighting , resembles Uma Thurman . Charlie falls for her and accepts a thousand dollars from the drunken rich guy in order to pay for the operation that will refurbish her eyeballs . Charlie is accused of stealing the thousand bucks but when he appeals to the rich guy , he's sober and won't support Charlie's story . Charlie manages to get the money to the girl anyway but then is picked up by the police and spends some time in jail . When he emerges from the Crowbar Hotel , broke and bitter , he bumps into the now sighted girl and she recognizes him by his voice and the feel of his hands . The happy ending . There's sentimentality in the story of course . There often is in Chaplin's later films . But , as usual , it's somehow tempered . Here , it's undercut by irony . When Charlie meets the wealthy toff , the guy is about to kill himself because his wife left him . He ties a noose around his neck and a big rock to the other end of the rope . He's about to hurl himself and the rock into the river when Charlie intervenes , gives him a pep talk , and changes his mind . His spirit revived , the rich guy spread his arms to the sky , dropping the boulder that falls on Charlie's foot . And when Chaplin meets the blind flower girl , she's enthralled by his gentleness . Unseen by her , the smitten Charlie tip toes behind her to the nearby water fountain where she fills a pail . Her expression is dreamy and far away as the pail fills . Charlie is sitting on a bench next to the fountain , himself enraptured . Then she empties the pail by throwing the water in Charlie's face . Well , it's not the blind Mr . Muckle busting all the light bulbs in W . C . Fields ' general store , but what is ? A note . There have been some comic prize fights recorded on film , not counting the Dempsey-Tunney debacle , but I don't think any are as funny as the one Chaplin has choreographed here . It's hard to imagine the kind of talent that could pull off a story like this in a medium like this . Black and white , and silent . Applause , please .
Flying High Now	This is not at all a bad movie . Earlier comments have observed that the first half of the film is mushy and corny , but let us be kind to the demand characteristics of the time . The USA was a lot cornier then than it is now . And even during that first half , the film is more than watchable . Van Johnson does his all-American boy bit ( has he ever done otherwise ) and it emerges as an appealing portrait of an ordinary guy , rather than the slavering war monger Ted Lawson could have been turned into . He's so naive he doesn't even hate the Japanese . He once had a friend who had a Japanese gardener who seemed like " a nice enough fellow . " His prevailing desire ? Not " Kill More Japs , " but , " Gee , I wish this war was over . " Phyllis Thaxter does an adequate job of hiding her anxiety beneath her love for her " fella . " The film is long and in many ways more detailed than the book and , hold on , in some ways an improvement . Lawson's book is short and to the point and dwells on his horrible wound in a way that a wartime movie could not . Mitchum's role is expanded and made complex by his not-quite-hidden attraction to Lawson's wife , Ellen . True , sometimes the mushiness goes over the top . The jitterbugging is unecessary and I don't suppose we really need the last dance to " Auld Lang Syne , " and yet when one of the wives whispers to her husband ( two characters we hardly know ) , " I love you , " over and over , the sense it evokes isn't one of bathos but of the anguish of impending loss and the helplessness people feel in the face of it . There are small details that seem true . Lawson is called up for his last flight while still hung over and he spills aspirin all over the bathroom floor while getting his gear together . The launch scenes aboard the Hornet are bullet biters . Everything seems barely organized chaos . Wind shrieks , clothing flaps , rain and spray splatter everyone , people shout to make themselves heard over the shattering noise and vibrations of airplane engines , last minute favors are asked and granted , and one never knows if the left engine will quit or whether the dorsal turret will work . And there has rarely been a more vivid conveyance of the sense of flight at low level , first over the sea , then over geometrical patterns of agriculture . Everything seems to be moving - - and moving too fast , almost , for comprehension . And always the roar and rush of engine and wind . ( I don't know why the list of locations for this film didn't include the coast of California , where the encounter between bombers and land was shot . ) The bombing itself , involving models , is rudimentary by today's standards . The crash of the B-25 into the massive surf during a rainstorm off the Chinese coast is over in a minute and we see Lawson staggering on the beach , staring at the double tail of the ruined airplane emerging from the ocean , saying mournfully , " I lost my ship . I lost my ship . " ( Little of this is in the book . ) From here on , the film gets a bit confusing . The Chinese are portrayed as sympathetic and as helpful as their conditions allow . The amputation of Lawson's leg is handled with surprising realistic detail . The scene makes it clear that he can feel the first bite of the surgeon's scalpel despite his spinal . " Boy , when you said you were gonna cut high you weren't kidding . " It doesn't get better , either . There's a silly scene of Lawson hallucinating a phone call to Ellen while he is stranded in timber country and a tree is sawed down and felled outside his window , but the incongruity comes as a relief since it removes us from the source of Lawson's pain . Lawson's return to safety and his reluctance to see his wife again because of his perceived deformity is as brief as convention allows . Thank God , nobody refers to him as " half a man . " All together , a fine film . An unforgettable one , even .
More things in heaven and earth . . .	I've only seen this once , when it was released more than twenty years ago , but have never been able to forget it . Two English women touring Versailles witness some strange people and odd goings on but they don't discuss it with one another until their return home , when they compare notes . Their independent accounts agree on most of the important points but there are enough discrepancies to pique their interest . Some further research seems to indicate that the people and events they were witness to are long dead . One lady , wearing what is consistently called a " fichou " - - I can only imagine what that is - - may have been Marie Antoinette . The rest of the movie , about half , is taken up with their decision to publish their experiences , inviting ridicule . That's a bit sketchy but it's been a long time . I remember it for a number of reasons . One is Hannah Gordon's performance . She consistently wears a dreamy far-away look , as if not really paying attention to what others are saying , until something is said that irritates her and then she snaps back into the present with some cutting remark . Another memorable feature of the movie is the way the experience , let's call it " supernatural " , is played . No spooky music . No dialog at all . The women walk in slow motion through a fuzzily photographed set that seems imbued with mystery and heat . It's extremely effective . Another reason I remember it is that it serves as - - if not exactly a wake-up call for scientists - - at least a nudge in the night . The story seems simple . Two sexually repressed ladies , disturbed by the strange surroundings and the summer heat , become pixillated and see ghosts . There was a lot of that sort of thing going about in Victorian and Edwardian England - - ghosts , fairies , seances . Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was involved in it , and Harry Houdini , and Madam Blavatsky was a best seller . Well , it's understandable . The belief that God was behind everything was being challenged by Darwinism and other scientific advances , and it was natural that people should want to explore in the interface ( or " warfare " as some called it ) between science and religion . Nowadays we've outgrown all that superstition . Skeptics are fond of quoting the Scottish philosopher David Hume , something to the effect that if someone reports a miracle and tries to explain it by invoking an even greater miracle , he will always accept the lesser of the two miracles . Since nobody believes in miracles anymore , this dictum has a modern ring to it . But if you substitute " probability " for " miracle , " it begins to look a bit less powerful . At one time , after all , it would have been a miracle for stones to fall from the skies , so every thinking person rejected the possibility . That was before the discovery of meteorites . I've been a research scientist for thirty years and have forced myself to keep an open mind , especially to events I think are silly or work in favor of my own prejudices . Another person and I once had an experience with what can only be called an unidentified flying object . It turned my conception of the world on a tilt . I've tried since then to avoid the kind of colossal arrogance that leads to thinking that our generation stands on the peak of knowledge , and that although there is more to learn about the universe , no knowledge that we already rely on can be mistaken . Baloney . There are things we don't know - - and we don't know that we don't know them . I don't know if those two ladies went through the experience they claimed . But the possibility can't be simply dismissed .
So much better than it would be if remade today .	I think I've only seen this twice - - once in its release , when I was a kid , and again on TV , about ten years ago , so my memory of the details are a bit fuzzy . The plot is rudimentary by our standards . A sniper ( Arthur Franz ) is stalking San Francisco . The police ( Adolf Menjou ) want to either shoot him or catch him and send him to the gas chamber . The humanist psychiatrist ( Richard Kiley ) argues that anyone who snipes women who are strangers to him must be mentally ill and the object of his capture should be incarceration and treatment rather than death . As I said , it's pretty dated , isn't it ? Compare it to " Dirty Harry , " in which the sniper is nothing more than an evildoer who shoots San Franciscans " because he likes it . " The Dirty Harry sniper is protected by an ineffectual judicial system . We root for Harry who simply wants to " shoot the b . " How times have changed . About the time this movie was released , my underaged friends and I used to peek through the windows of a lesbian bar in Greenwich Village . Every third or fourth time we were lined up with our noses against the glass , a police officer would sneak up behind us and go down the row hitting us on top of the head with his baton - - BOP , BOP , BOP . . . Always the same cop ! And without even reading us our rights ! That's the attitude of the police in this movie . The cops are practically paleolithic . Nobody's hampered by this business about fair treatment . Kill ' em all and let God sort ' em out ! ( Please , that's called " sarcasm " . ) Menjou is outraged and snappish , Kiley the voice of sweet reason . And Franz , the sniper ? Well , it had something to do with his mother . We don't find this out until about half way through the movie when his landlady tells him to be careful with his stove , didn't his mother ever teach him that ? Franz stops in mid-stair and grimly announces , " My mother never taught me anything . " The movie is dated in two other ways . I can't tell you how shocking the murder scenes were in 1952 . The critics were appalled and some theaters edited out the shootings . But the two or three that are shown on the screen are in long shot and by current standards ludicrously tame . Here's the other way in which its dated - - the resolution . The police finally identify the sniper , find out which barren room Franz lives in , determine that he's at home , and surround the place with an army of cop cars and tommy-gun agents of the law , every sight trained on the windows of Franz's digs . Franz spots them , assembles and loads his rifle , and waits for them . Menjou , who has by this time begun to see what Kiley has been driving at , calls through a bullhorn for Franz to come out with his hands up . Silence . The cops want to turn the apartment into lace but Menjou demurs . Let's try to talk to him first . A party of them , bristling with guns , sneaks up the stairs and slowly swings open the door to Franz's room expecting him to start shooting . Instead they find Franz sitting in front of the windows , rifle across his lap , catatonic , tears on his face . Imagine a similar contemporary movie ending with such a dying fall . Would the cops find Franz sitting quietly alone ? That's meant to be a rhetorical question . I think we all know what would happen in a modern movie when the police surrounded Franz's apartment . Just follow the numbers . Every window for miles around would be shattered by bullets . The walls would be splattered with blood and brains . The sniper would drag a 40 millimeter cannon out of his closet . San Francisco would be levelled . The actual quiet resolution would generate in modern audiences a vague sense of disappointment . " Talky , " the kids would complain between gulps of high-energy soft drinks . " Too slow . " Stanley Kramer , never an articulate man in his own right , turned extraordinarily preachy in his later movies , but this is Kramer during his early period , when he didn't LOOM over his productions quite so much . Splendid use is made of unfamiliar and very ordinary San Francisco locations , by the way . The movie was shot at a time when the city still had a sizable working-class population , now largely disappeared . Worth seeing , definitely .
Above Average Drama	The story of a young man ( Power ) who is a barker at a carnival in the Midwest . He's cuckolding this old drunk , accidentally kills him , and then coaxes " the code " out of the dead man's wife ( Blondell ) . The two-person code is a secret way of pronouncing words that enables a blindfolded " psychic " to read and answer questions that his partner picks up from the audience . The act is a real moneymaker and soon enough Power deserts the carnival and takes off with a pretty young woman ( Gray ) for the Big Time in Chicago , playing night clubs . The money rolls in but Power wants more . He falls in with a shrink ( Walker ) who has a closet full of secrets from her clients . With access to these he bamboozles a rich guy into handing over $150K . Power even gets Gray to pose as the man's long dead love , but Gray breaks down when she sees the " chump " fall to his knees and start to pray , and she blows the con . She and Power barely make it out of town ahead of the police . He sends her back to the carnival and begins hitting the bottle . Some time later he shows up at a carnival , a physical and mental shambles , and is given the lowest job available , a " geek " - - somebody who eats live chickens in return for a bottle a day and a place to sleep it off . He's a broken man but finally comes around when he accidentally joins a carnival that Gray is performing in . End of story . This is well above average . Much of the credit must go to Tyrone Power in what has to be his best dramatic performance . He's always been good at projecting self confidence , and he does it here , but the script also demands that he turn into an alcoholic wreck and he's equally convincing . The other performances are quite good too , including Joan Blondell as a tough but nurturant floozy , and Colleen Gray , the profile of whose nose speaks for itself . She doesn't HAVE to be particularly good . All she has to do is stand there and you can't take your eyes from that baby-doll face . Jules Furthman's script helps a lot in unobtrusive ways . In most movies of this type , the characters speak as if they had all graduated from Oberlin . Here they sound like real , working-class stiffs of the 30s and 40s - - dropping their " g " s and sayin ' " ain't . " The odd double negative don't mean nothing ' to them . There isn't too much of this louche touch , just enough for it to slip past our apperceptive apparatus without calling attention to itself . Ben Nye did the makeup . He ought to get a medal for what he does to Tyrone Power's eyes at the end . Power doesn't look grotesque or in any way overdone , but it's as if Dorian Gray's portrait had suddenly been revealed to us halfway through Wilde's tale . His eyes are just short of a gargoyle's . He looks the way we all sometimes feel in the morning . Withall , I must say that some of the strength of Power's performance comes from corny overacting . He has two modalities in his presentation of self . One is his usual good-natured self-interested wise-guy cynic . The other is a saintly kind of smiling sing-song he employs while trying to con someone . Now , we in the audience know which is which because we've been clued in by what we've learned . But there are times when he uses his con-man persona on people who should know better , including his wife ! Colleen Gray too is liable to lapse into emotional outbursts that don't give us the feeling that there's much behind them except energy . These are the kinds of wrinkles it's the director's job to smooth over and he was nodding at the time . The photography by Lee Garmes is impressive . Great use of shadows and key lights . In fact the whole movie is pretty good . If only Power had stuck to his phony mentalist act and not dragged God kicking and screaming onto the stage . That's known as " hubris " and you know what happens when you pull THAT kind of stunt . For me , the most telling scene appears near the end , when Power has become a dipsomaniacal hobo . He and a handful of other bums are huddled under a railroad trestle . Power is holding a bottle of whiskey and begins to demonstrate the carny trick called a " cold reading , " using the bottle as a prop . Then he shrugs and makes some rueful comment . While he stares silently , the others take his bottle and pass it around . He shakes off his rumination , looks around with fright , and cries , " Hey , where's my bottle ? There won't be enough left for me ! " A vagrant replies , " Buddy , you're a real mind reader , " and drains it . Power yanks the empty bottle from his hand , goggles at it , and then sucks from it desperately . When he looks around , the others are gone and a train is rattling like a calamity over his head . Potent stuff .
Excellent crime thriller .	This is a long , involved , and generally superior caper movie , something on the order of " The Asphalt Jungle " but with a cop thrown into the sauce . In addition , as a kind of subplot , we have a duel of wits between Pacino who represents LA's Robbery and Homicide , and DeNiro as the head of the honorable gang betrayed by a renegade member . The cast on the whole is splendid . Pacino gives a wide-eyed arm-waving , thoroughly enjoyable performance . As his third wife , Diane Venora with her feline eyes is the sensible spouse who feels she is not sharing her husband's life because he doesn't feel she should know about the rottener side of his work . If this sounds a bit familiar , it may be because you've run into this conflict in so many other movies , including " Bullit " , " The Godfather , " and others . She is the only character who is given lines that make her sound as if she's gone to college - - " What you do is sift through the debris , then pick up the scent and follow it , " describing how she views her husband's job . DeNiro is more restrained , thoughtful , solemn , always seeming to be strangling his passion . His motto : " Never get involved in anything you're not ready to turn your back on and walk out of in thirty seconds flat . " Until he meets Amy Brennerman , a pretty young woman who turns in an understated performance filled with nuance . Val Kilmer's pinched face has now progressed beyond prettiness and has acquired real character , matched by his acting here . Two performances are absolute standouts . John Voight as the avuncular source of street information , a kind of Mentor to the gang , is flawless in the role . He has turned into a marvelous character actor . And Ashley Judd as Kilmer's love interest has to be one of our more underused and underrated actresses . She has plump lips , darting dark eyes , and a most mobile face and expressive body , able to convey more with a smile or a gesture than imaginable . She is a magnetic presence in this movie and in some others , so much so that when she is on screen she seems to command it without trying . All the major characters have domestic problems , including an African-American driver recruited by the gang at the last minute . But these conflicts are secondary to the main thread of this complex plot , which involves two big heists , several shoot-outs in crowded streets , and a couple of murders in between , some of them off screen . The film is as admirable for what it leaves out as what it includes . There are - - this may be difficult to believe - - there are no slow-motion scenes of violence and not a single car chase . A man trying to escape in a pickup is shot while speeding away . The traditional , moribund thriller / action scenario DEMANDS that this vehicle either blow up like a Claymore or end its earthly existence in a spectacular slow-motion crash . But , no . The director has the truck with the dead man at the wheel slow down and roll to bump gently against a cyclone fence . Yes , folks , it's true . See it for this reason if for no other .
Strength and Grace	There's a scene in " Some Like it Hot " in which Jack Lemmon dances a tango with Joe E . Brown . The tune is a famous one , La Cumparasita or something like that , turned into an American pop song in the 1950s with English lyrics and named " Strange Sensations . " Anyway , the dance is played for laughs . Well , it's understandable . The conventions of the tango seem so automated to someone used to other forms . But what surprised me here was the flexibility of the form , the way it is adapted to circumstances . There is , of course , a number here in which two or three dancers express intense passion , the emotion we usually associate with the tango . But there is also a number that is informed by humor . Suarez , who is about to direct a show featuring the tango , native to Argentina , is alone in his studio , talking to himself about the folly of falling in love , and he imagines a scene in which the silhouettes of two dancers perform a comic number , waggling their bottoms at the camera , the music bumping along in the background featuring a few strings and a flatulating tuba , itself an amusing instrument in sound and appearance . Thank you Lalo Schifrin . As an Hispanic himself , Schifrin knows what he's doing . ( He makes good use of the bandoneon , a kind of concertina , too . ) There is a less-successful number that uses boots and military uniforms in an evocation of the period in the 1970s and 1980s when citizens of Argentina were " disappeared . " There are tango-tinged encounters between men and others involving women , that are homosexual in effect . And sometimes there is no music behind the dances at all - - only the natural sounds of clothing rustling and soles squeaking on the wooden floor as the performers twist and turn . Let me get back to that homosexual dance between the two women . One of them , if I got it right , is Suarez's ex wife , a superb dancer played by Cecilia Narova . The younger one is played by Mia Maestro . The dance ends with a sensuous kiss , and I can understand why another woman might want to kiss Maestro . I could understand it even if some twisted extraterrestrial whose native notion of esthetic perfection looked like the inside of an alarm clock wanted to kiss Maestro . She is egregiously beautiful , two-thirds Diane Venora and one third Audrey Hepburn , and sports what must be , even to the most jaded eye , a nearly perfect body whose movements are entirely under her own control . Her high kicks beat those of Eleanor Powell . And when her numbers freeze in tableaux , it would be perfectly okay if she just retained those balletic poses for , oh , say five or six minutes so we can burn the images into our brains . I don't think the human form and the suppleness of which it is capable has ever been displayed more elegantly . Not to put down Fred and Ginger . That's a different ballroom game . The Spanish as spoken is appropriately Argentinian too , for what it's worth . The pronunciation is regional and so is the grammar . I say this out of complete ignorance of the language except for that which comparative linguists tell us . And a chat buddy in Buenos Aires . ( Besos a vos , mi companera ) . The plot is nothing much . Abstract and arty and colorful . Saura's 8 . Suarez , the benign director of a musical show , falls for Maestro . She is living with a Mafioso who is a dangerous dude , sub specie aeternitatus . But she tells the Mafioso off anyway and stalks off as he shouts after her - - " You're making a big mistake . " If it did turn out to be a mistake we don't learn about it . The movie ends happily if trickily . I want to emphasize that the dances are just about everything here . They bear about the same relationship to Lemon and Brown's tango as Fred and Ginger's superbly rehearsed dances do to the twist . There is one number by Maestro in which she does nothing but walk around slowly and strike an occasional pose . It's stunning in it simplicity and sensuousness . And in the duets , the dancers hold each other so close through so many acrobatic movements that , without stretching too much , I can imagine one false step bringing them tumbling to the floor wrapped up in each other . The photography and lighting ( by Vittorio Storaro ) is superlative and the art direction equally so . Everything takes place in a carefully designed studio with mirrors and stages and painted backdrops scattered around . Sometimes we don't know if we're looking into a mirror or seeing the " real " scene . Nor can we always be sure that what we're watching is taking place in " real " life or in Suarez's imagination - - sometimes the imaginary turns into the real . But none of this detracts from our understanding of the film . The " double " structure is not simple directorial self display , nor is it just more hokum about " what's reality and what's illusion ? " . It adds visual texture to a film that already has more than a dozen Hollywood monstrosities could hold . It's really art , without quotation marks around it .
Deliberate , thoughtful , adult drama .	What a satisfying movie this is . A small snowy town in the Canadian north is struck by a tragedy . A big-city lawyer ( Ian Holm ) visits the place shortly after a school bus trundles off an icy highway and drowns most of the kids aboard . Holm wants to sue somebody - - passionately , angrily . In the course of interviewing victims or surviving relatives he seems to disrupt the comfortable configuration of relationships that has kept the community rolling smoothly along its undistinguished path . Now , this , I know , suggests a film with a villain - - the lawyer . ( Lawyers are always good heavies . ) His avaricious entreaties turn the peaceful , god-fearing sons of the soil against one another . There are bitter arguments . Some of the parents are eager to get the money - - the ugly parents , the ones with beards and scars and tattoos and cigarettes . The better-looking parents oppose the law suit . Finally the lawyer is tarred , feathered , and ridden out of town on the rail - - scowling and shouting curses . But not at all . Maybe that's how it would turn out in a dumb Hollywood movie but not here . The lawyer is angry , yes , and he tries to rouse the anger of the community , but not for their benefit but for his own emotional payoff . His young , estranged daughter is a junkie and only seems to call him with lies , begging for cash . If he can mobilize the community , channel their grief into anger , it will help justify his conviction that " they're taking our children away from us . " This is a film with a lot of layers and there isn't enough space to get into them to any extent . I'll just mention in passing that one of the surviving school kids ( Sarah Polley ) , now bound to a wheelchair , is shown from time to time reading " The Pied Piper of Hamlin " to two sleepy kids , a story that seems to wrap up in fairy-tale form the tragic accident that deprived the town of its kids . I'll mention too that the town about which one resident says , " We used to be a community , " is largely mythical in the sense he means it . Some " community . " There is hidden bigotry , " They're Indians . I guess you'd call them . . . hippies . " There's an adulterous couple rolling around in a motel bed like two macaques in heat . There is incest , with the father banging his cute teen-aged daughter in a barn surrounded by candles . This , however , is not the " community " that the residents finally decide to preserve . It's the myth of that community that's important . The road to satisfaction ( or our very sanity ) lies partly in being blind to certain things . And the tragedy of the bus sinking beneath the ice of the frozen lake ? In a standard typical Hollywood film it would be saved and used as a grisly climax with tight shots of children screaming and underwater shots of their flailing around and glub blub noises on the sound track . Here we don't even find out what the events WAS until the movie is half over , and we don't see it until half an hour later , and then only in long shot . The lawyer is intent on pinning the blame on somebody , but the bus , driven by a caring , responsible , and experienced woman has traveled the same route for 15 years before hitting a sheet of ice that carries it off the country road . On which " somebody " does the blame lie ? Well - - without getting into theology - - is rests on nobody . If you walk into a cybercafe , say , and sit down and find the keyboard is too high for you , is it your " fault " because you're short ? No . Is it the keyboard's " fault " for being too high ? Nope again . It's known as a " dysfunction " and if you can't fix it you have to eat it . The editor must have worked hard on putting this jigsaw puzzle together . There are so many intercuts that you can't be sure whether you're dealing with flashbacks or flashforwards . Not to fault the editing though . It's often strangely apt . A helicopter shot follows the school bus on its winding way then slowly drifts upward into an empty crystalline blue sky with a few wisps of cloud . Cut to the lawyer chatting with another passenger on an airplane back to his big-city home . The performances are first-rate all the way through , with Sarah Polley particularly memorable . She's radiantly beautiful , of course , but we can't hold that against her . ( Half the people in Hollywood are outrageously gorgeous . ) She has a little-girl voice that sounds untrained but she makes the most of it , as she does of her minimalized facial expressions . A viewer's first thought is that , " This is it . This is all she's got . She's playing herself . " That would be a mistake . She was quite a different character , a mad repressed wife , in " The Weight of Water " , and still another character , totally generic , in some dumb remake of a slasher movie . When I first saw this some years ago , I figured one viewing would be enough . But then I just watched it again and couldn't let go because I was able to pick up things that I'd missed first time around . If you have the patience required to watch this , your patience will probably be rewarded .
Survivor	Film makers have to step carefully when dealing with issues like the Nazi extermination program . There have been equally brutal programs of ethnic cleansing in places like Southeast Asia and Rwanda , in which hundreds of millions died , but nothing like this in Europe since the Middle Ages . The victims here were not only Jews but Gypsies , the mentally ill , homosexuals , socialists , communists , and political undesirables . The Nazis eliminated not six million but some uncountable number between 12 and 15 million . An event like that can't be treated lightly and milked for easy tears , or the event itself is cheapened . Fortunately , the films that have explored the subject have been uniformly well done , as Roman Polanski's " The Pianist " is well done . Polanski himself suffered in much the same way as the protagonist , Vlad Szpilman ( Adrien Brody ) . Polanski has a habit of embellishing his tales but there's no question that in this instance he knows what he's talking about . Szpilman is a well-known young pianist on Warsaw radio but the German occupation puts the station out of business . He and his family are herded into the Warsaw ghetto where they are subject to constant abuse and occasional murder . Szpilman barely escapes being sent to Treblinka with the rest of his family . And for the last half of the film , with the help of some friends who endanger themselves by lending him aid , he scuttles rat-like from one hiding place to another , each more dismal and perilous than the last . He suffers jaundice , his hair and beard grow long , his clothes turn to tatters , his food disappears , he's half frozen , and he seems to shrink . He's reduced to living in the attic of a nearly demolished apartment building and is ecstatic to discover a gallon can of pickles overlooked on the top shelf of a kitchen cabinet . The can falls out of his hands while he tries to open it and rolls across the floor to come to rest at the boots of a German officer , Captain Hosenfeld ( Thomas Kretschmann ) . The only Germans we've seen so far have been brutes - - ridiculing the insane , executing Jews who ask simple questions , or simply shooting people chosen at random . We expect nothing from Hosenfeld except a quick shooting . But Hosenfeld is a human being and , having discovered that Szpilman " is " - - or rather " was " - - a pianist , he asks him to play a piano left in one of the flats . Szpliman has been unable to play for years and when he seats himself we worry that he might not bring it off and , indeed , his first chords are tentative , uncertain . Then his playing becomes automated , the old habits return , and he dashes off a dramatic and exquisitely executed piece of Chopin . Hosenfeld has been leaning back , enjoying the music , then leaves Szpilman quietly to his attic . He returns a few times later , before the Germans withdraw before the Russians , and unceremoniously hands him a few packages of food and , finally , his overcoat . The matter-of-fact compassion shown by Hosenfeld , and Szpilman's desperate need for contact with another human , are very moving . When the Russian troops finally arrive , Szpilman stumbles out of his hovel to greet them , but seeing his overcoat the Russians open fire on him . Szpilman finally convinces them that he is a Pole , not a German , and one of the befuddled soldiers asks , " Then why the ing coat ? " Szpilman is trembling with fear but manages to gulp , " I was cold . " An epilogue tells us that Szpilman went on with his career and Hosenfeld wound up in a Soviet prison camp where he died in 1952 , despite Szpilman's attempt to find him . Under the end credits , a smiling Szpilman plays a lively , sparkling composition by Chopin . It's a remarkable film . Polanski is no longer the Wunderkind but a mature film maker . Nothing is excessive . We need only as much as we need to know to understand Szpilman's travails - - one tragedy following another . There are no sentimental speeches at the final parting of Szpilman and his family . Szpilman himself never breaks down . He simply does what needs to be done to survive . And Adrien Brody captures what Szpilman must have been like . ( From some angles he resembles the young Arthur Rubenstein . ) Kretschmann gets Hosenfeld down pat as well . In their scenes together we sense their respective positions - - one man with nothing left to lose , the other with nothing left to gain . The story , and the historical facts it's based on , raise many questions about human nature , of course . I'm not at all sure that if we could find the answers to those questions we would like what we found . One of the better films of the year .
A genre movie unlike any other .	When I worked in a psychiatric hospital I noticed that one or two of the patients had a peculiar tendency to stand up , start walking purposefully across the ward , stop and look around , then begin walking just as purposefully in another direction , then sit down again . A kind of ambulatory non sequitur . This whole movie is like that . I mean that to be a compliment . People break up the interactive script they've initiated and do something completely unpredictable . I'll just give one example . Walker ( Marvin ) and his companion ( Angie Dickenson ) have an argument and she begins whacking him across the head with her purse . At first he guards himself with his arms but then lowers them and stands silently and without any expression as she beats him , slaps him , and pounds his chest , finally slumping to the floor exhausted . At that , he strides wordlessly to the couch , plops down , turns on the TV and begins surfing the channels . It's a neo-noir film if there ever was one . There is betrayal , a false woman , suicide , multiple double crosses , revenge , an urban setting , and an ambiguous ending . So , although it is a genre film , it is nevertheless unique . Everything comes together . The production designer gives us sterile urban vistas , featuring bland cement boxes and the Los Angeles River , without which no noir would be complete . The apartments these people live in look like ordinary arid gray middle-class bourgeois digs . Wardrobe , too , has fitted these performers out in ordinary suits and ties , and the women are always rather chic looking . The direction and editing are splendid . I'll give an example of what I mean here , too . Lee Marvin throws John Vernon out on the roof of his penthouse , wrapped only in a bed sheet . Vernon begins to tumble over the edge , Marvin grabs for him but winds up holding only the sheet while Vernon plunges some dozen floors to the street below . ( His body winds up impossibly intact . A cat might have survived such a fall but a full-grown man would have splashed . ) In an ordinary movie , we'd get a cut from the body hitting the street to Marvin staring down at it over the railing . But here , Marvin is still holding the sheet . Not only that but it's WINDY on the fourteenth floor roof and the wind is whipping the sheet up into billows around Marvin , like some demonic object with its own malevolent life force , before he is finally able to unwrap himself and fling it away . The editing gives us a couple of brief flashbacks , but not just to evoke a mood . They are instrumental in letting us know what Marvin is thinking . Marvin is holding a gun to his ex-pal's , Vernon's , face and the poor guy faints until Marvin slaps him awake , and then he begs Marvin to trust him . A flashback lasting only a few seconds reminds us of an earlier scene in which Vernon begged Marvin's help in carrying out a heist and shouted at him , " Walker ! Trust me ! " The editing is so precise that in this - - and in a dozen other scenes - - a few seconds more or less would drain them of their impact . The score is by Johnny Mandel , an arranger and composer whose work I've admired for years . He was a child prodigy , played both trumpet and trombone with Tommy Dorsey's band before turning to composing and arranging . He's never edgy or irritating . His music is smooth and melodic and sometimes strangely orchestrated . Here he suits his talents to the demands of the scene . When a man is trying to seduce a woman , a romantic piano melody tinkles behind them . At other times , again depending on the context , the score glides from Henry Mancini to Gil Evans . Nicely done . So is the acting . Marvin has been this good in other films but never better . The plot has to do with his regaining $93 , 000 that " the organization " has cheated him out of . ( There is no mafia-ness to the movie . The only foreign language we hear is Portugese . ) And $93K was a lot of money then . You could find gas at 29 cents a gallon . Marvin more or less kills his way up the ladder searching for someone in a position to " pay me my money . " He finally gets to Carrol O'Connor who explains to him that in a huge corporation like this , nobody ever handles any money . O'Connor has got maybe eleven dollars in his wallet . And Marvin , holding a gun on him , hesitates and looks genuinely put out - - puzzled , the way a child might be puzzled by a disappointing reply . ( " No , there's no Santa Claus . " ) I think I'll leave it at that before I run out of space . I've pretty much skipped the plot but that must be adequately covered elsewhere . Besides , the plot is either extremely simple or very complicated indeed , depending on how far you want your conjectures to dig . ( Is the whole movie nothing more than the fantasy of Marvin as he lies dying on Alcatraz after being shot at the beginning of the story ? See what I mean ? ) Don't miss it .
Moving Picture	Spoilers . When I saw this years ago it struck me as not having enough battle scenes in it . Now with my blood testosterone leveling off I think I have a better handle on it . Most war movies of the period seemed to include three elements whenever possible : combat , romance , and banter between battles . This one has all of them , although the romance has to be squeezed in with a shoehorn . The banter is sometimes funny . A handful of soldiers are sitting around in a cramped , miserably wet shelter dug out of the rock . One removes his boots . One by one the others quietly sniff and throw suspicious glances at one another . Ernie Pyle , crouched there fully dressed , looks back at the others and says , " It wasn't me . " ( Nothing to do with boots ! ) There is also a certain corny sort of sentimentality associated with at least one of the characters , a beat-up exhausted non-com who tries repeatedly and without success to play a home-made record from his son . ( First time I remember seeing a scene like that was in " Destination Tokyo . " ) I was sure the record would be played for every tear it was worth after the father's death , but that's not what happens at all . There is only one real scene of combat and it's well done . Howard Hawks may have seen it before making " El Dorado . " Mitchum does a journeyman job as Captain Walker , tough and humane as all company commanders in these movies usually are . Yet , he's so good , particularly in a scene alone with Pyle on Christmas Eve , that he brings more to the part than the minimal requirements . Burgess Meredith as Pyle is equally good . He can rattle the rafters when he overacts , but he doesn't do it here . He's quietly believable as a humble war correspondent more concerned with writing about the guy in the mud than about the generals . " The G . I . , " he ruminates , " He lives so miserable . He dies so miserable . " Ernie Pyle wasn't a great writer . He didn't have the ego for it . He left that up to more florid artists , like Hemingway , who described in one of his articles how he had to take over command of a landing craft at Normandy from a green officer in order to make sure it landed in the right place . Or Walter Cronkite , who could use a leader on a story like , " I Just Returned From a Mission to Hell . " But if Pyle was no literary artist , he wasn't a dismissible hack either , especially when his circumstances are taken into account . A hack might write something like , " The shells roared overhead like freight trains . " Pyle wrote : " Artillery shells rustled overhead . " ( " Rustled . " ) The poor unpretentious Pulitzer prize winner took a bullet in the forehead on Ie Shima , in the Pacific . And Captain Walker is killed too . Not dramatically , nor heroically , but offscreen , just another body being brought in by mule , already in rigor . The scene is played on screen exactly as Pyle wrote it , with some of the men coming to Walker's body , staring at it before moving on , one or two of them telling Walker how sorry they are . No one sheds a tear . This is a man they liked and respected , but they've already seen so many dead bodies . It's a scene that can't help moving a viewer . The men then shuffle off in silhouette over to the top of a dark , brooding hill , with no triumphant military music to accompany them . It is a striking image of the futility of war . And it ought to be . The Italian campaign which is followed in this film was a disaster . The peninsula , the boot of Italy , has mountains that resemble the skeleton of a fish , with multiple hills running east and west out of the spine of the Apennines . Nobody could design better defensive terrain if they tried , and the Germans were very good . The allies , represented not just by Americans and Brits , but by French , New Zealanders , Gurkhas , Poles , and Canadians , gained nothing worthwhile . In the initial invasion they tried to outflank the enemy with an amphibious landing behind their lines . It failed . The allies slogged on through terrible weather to the next formidable line where they were stopped . They tried to outflank the enemy with an amphibious landing behind their lines . It failed . At the Gustav Line , the Allied advance was stopped at the foot of Monte Cassino , a thousand-year-old Benedictine monastery , which we mistakenly believed was being used as an artillery observation post . We finally bombed the monastery to smithereens , and after the dust settled the Germans immediately moved into the rubble and used it as an observation post . When , finally , it seemed we had gotten behind the German lines , instead of forging west and trapping their troops , the general in charge of the Fifth Army turned north instead and raced towards the open city of Rome so he could have the honor of being the first to enter it . And so it went . Some of this tragedy was captured on film by John Huston in " The Battle of San Pietro , " which went through some problems because it showed dead American soldiers instead of just dead German soldiers . But none of this could appear , except by implication , in " The Story of G . I . Joe . " However , the final scene is suitably bleak . It might be Death himself leading that dance over the top of the hill .
Dorothy , the Small and Meek .	Beautiful fantasy , unimpeachably realized . Dorothy is knocked out and dreams she is transported to the Land of Oz , where only the Wizard of the Emerald City can send her and her dog , Toto , back to her home in Kansas . Along the way , she picks up three companions who hope that their defects can be corrected by the Wizard . Ray Bolger is the Scarecrow , Jack Haley is the Tin Man , and Bert Lahr the Cowardly Lion . They are all hated and opposed by the Wicked Witch of the East , Margaret Hamilton . It ends happily . Just a few comments . One is that the three companions are kind of interesting . The Scarecrow and the Tin Man are flawed in some way - - one needs brains and the other needs a heart - - but they illustrate a gentleman's model of interaction . " Oh , thank you very much . " And , " I wouldn't want to be a burden . " And , in truth , the Scarecrow doesn't seem so dumb . Look at the way he tricks the talking trees into giving up their apples . And the Tin Man shows no signs whatever of having no heart , except that his chest doesn't tick . They're charming without being particularly funny . But the Cowardly Lion is a different matter . He speaks for Everyman . Lahr is outrageously hammy . He has a working-class New York accent . He brags and threatens and he's a complete hypocrite , which the others definitely are not . He's given the best lines and songs too . " What makes the Hottentot so hot ? Whadda they got that I ain't got ? " ( Steatopygeia , the Hottentot apron , and a language that doesn't seem designed for human speech organs , among other things . ) He's our man in Oz alright . Dorothy , of course , is the central figure , and Judy Garland plays her splendidly - - weak and winsome , with huge watery brown eyes . And what a voice ! She's a small girl but she seems to sing from her abdomen . She's just about right , cute but not the sort of " cute " that rouses the pedophile in a normal man . She has high hips , rather shapeless limbs , and no neck to speak of . Later in life , strung out behind leapers and sleepers with a booze backer , she became an idol of the gay subculture . They loved her in her middle age . Every performance raised the question of whether she would finish the show or collapse on the stage . Another thing that strikes me . As in some other films , and speaking as a one-time day laborer who showed up in the line on Warren Street in New York , who does the work around here ? In the Emerald City , everybody wears bright green costumes . Who presses them all ? And then there's that " horse of a different color . " Who cleans up after that horse ? The songs by Harold Arlen and Yip Harberg are just fine , and the incidental music was heavily influenced by Russian composers . The wardrobe is outrageous . The four of the principals , or five , counting Toto , go through so many adventures and tribulations that when the end comes and it's time for Dorothy to leave , even the most sophisticated and mature among us must weep abjectly , like a child . Maybe Dorothy should have stayed in Oz , married the Scarecrow , served as First Lady and run the place instead of leaving behind a rather shaky political structure . Queen Dorothy . After all , things weren't so smashing back in Kansas . Aunt Em was a pretty cold fish , her husband was emasculated , and the three laborers treated her as a nincompoop . It might have been good to be the Queen . Here's a final thing that struck me . I must have watched this thing a dozen times or more , usually with my kid . I just finished seeing it again for the first time in ten years or so , and this time on an HD TV on an HD channel with Dolby 5 . 1 sound . The difference was remarkable . I had never been able to see , for instance , that the Tin Man is blotched with small rust patches all over , until he's buffed bright and shiny in the Emerald City . And every stitch of the Scarecrow is visible . This is one you can't really miss . Your cultural literacy depends upon it .
Civics for Dummies .	Boy , do we ever need a refresher course in the subject . 2006 has been quite a year , worth studying in some detail . Congress proposed a bill that would hike the minimum wage for the first time in almost ten years . ( Meanwhile , Congress had voted itself almost ten raises in the same period . ) Enemies of the minimum wage hike tacked on a repeal of the estate tax for the mega-wealthy , so the bill flunked . I just give that as an example of how some things worked during this past year , a period in which Congress worked for 93 days . ( They gave themselves two weeks off for St . Patty's day alone . ) Anyone who follows the news knows as much as I've just written , and in fact I may have added some misleading details out of ignorance . How can such things happen ? If a bill is designed to raise the minimum wage , period , how can an explosive device like a repeal of the estate tax be buried in it ? How , exactly , does a bill get " hung up in committee " ? WHAT committee , and why ? And how come the House Ways and Means Committee is always described in the press as " powerful " ? What makes it so damned powerful ? All these kinds of issues are raised and answered in a five-minute lecture given by Saunders ( Jean Arthur ) to Honorary Senator Jeff Smith ( Jimmy Stewart ) . It's not really as complicated as it sounds . I learned more from Saunders ' little explanation than I did during months of civics in the fifth grade . So much for your class , Mrs . Greene . You never liked me anyway , and to tell you the truth I always found you a little overbearing . And I didn't care for that business of whacking people with the ruler either . The movie , as a movie , is informative but sterile . The villains are really villainous - - except for Claude Raines , the bad guy who turns good . The issue in this case is hardly one involving life and death . It's not about the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge or abortion or capital punishment . It's about a kind of Boy Scout camp that Stewart wants to build on some unused acres in his home state , land that will be paid for by the Boy Scouts themselves by sending in their nickels and dimes . ( " No more than ten cents apiece , " says Stewart . ) As in many of Capra's populist and popular entertainments there are shady shenanigans going on behind all the public nobility displayed . A bad guy ( Edward Arnold ) intends to build a lucrative dam on that land and discredits Stewart , who is humiliated and scorned by his former admirers . The format is familiar and undemanding . And of course no one in Washington is as naive as Stewart . The Boy Scouts ? Dimes ? Are you kidding ? But it is SO simple that , like a fairy tale , it becomes gripping . We watch as Hansel and Gretl are prepared to be popped into the oven . If it were any more realistic , aimed at a more sophisticated audience , it wouldn't work . The characters and their motives have to be clear and pure . That's the whole point of the movie . The simplicity leads us step by step through the political process , as an army training film might tell you how to dismantle an M-16 . What realism the film has disappears almost entirely at the end , when Stewart collapses on the Senate floor but is saved by Claude Raines who has just undergone some sort of epiphany . Man , does Stewart suffer through his lone filibuster , his voice shot , two days without sleep , disheveled and shaky , only to be redeemed at the end by Raines . No need to get into religion here but that epiphany and that suffering for all our sakes is suggestive . I watched it last night after not having seen it for years and expected to be bored , but wasn't . I enjoyed the film for its entertainment value , and because now I know a little more about how things inside the Beltway can go so terribly wrong .
Landmark Series	I can't see any reason to go on at great length about this 9-part series . It's a technically revolutionary film . Burns and his colleagues , along with Errol Morris , have changed the nature of the documentary . Burns , working with old photos on glass plates , an unpromising base , the occasional talking head , and often penetrating and sometimes poignant voiceovers , has contributed to our cultural iconography . His touches have been imitated countless times in the following decade : the sound of buzzing locusts , the voiceover reading a letter or a military report and then signing off by reading the name of the writer aloud , these are now taken-for-granted techniques in documentaries ( and commercials as well ) . It could be argued that before this series appeared , interest in the Civil War as an historical event was practically nonexistent . I'm not referring to interest in seeing pretty ladies bounce down the stairs of the big house wearing hoop skirts and ribbons , but the ghastly things taking place at locations that previously had barely rung a bell in our collective long-term memories , like Shiloh . I was teaching at an eastern university when this series appeared , roughly fifty students , known to be among the brightest available , majoring in communications ( read " journalism " ) . When the series had finished , I asked the class how many had watched at least one episode . One hand went up , tentatively . I asked why she'd been so tentative and she said , well , she hadn't really " watched " it , but her husband was a CW buff and was taping it while she passed through the living room several times . The last I heard , fewer than fifty percent of our High School seniors could pin the Civil War down to the correct half-century . It's against this background of general ignorance that " The Civil War " should be viewed . It's structure was more popular than academic , and it seems to have had a good deal of general appeal , my elite class notwithstanding . Popular enough so that a book appeared shortly afterward , " Historians Respond , " edited by Bob Toplin , which predictably consisted almost entirely of carping over details , and of claims that Burns missed the whole point of the CW , that he didn't pay enough attention to the role of women and African-Americans . In other words , that he didn't make the kind of movie that THEY would have made . ( Why is it that academic professionals are so irritated when an outsider , or even an insider , achieves popular success in their fields ? ) They demand too much . For one thing , a viewing of the series makes it clear that Burns et al put some effort into presenting the points of view of women and African-Americans . If the prevailing professional opinion is that he didn't go far enough , well , every book has a last page . A program dealing exclusively with the part that slavery played in the CW would have been another program . A word about the commentators . Bearse knows combat ; he was a marine on Guadalcanal . He sticks to military facts , mostly tactical . Senator Symington is surprisingly smooth and knowledgeable . I was kind of surprised to find him here . The two chief commentators represent the original opposing points of view . Shelby Foote states proudly in the epilogue to one of his historical volumes on the CW , " I am a Mississippian . " But he's a gentleman , not a stereotypical redneck . He admires the Confederate Southern Army without disparaging the Federals . ( Who could help admiring the CSA as a military force ? ) But , like all polite Southerners , he seems slightly ill at ease discussing the CW in a public venue . He seems like a nice guy and is a marvelous story teller . Barbara Fields , an academic historian , has far less screen time . The first impression the viewer gets is that , wow , she's a knockout looker ! The second is that she's cool as a cucumber and presents the modern view that the CW was all about slavery , that blacks were the central figures , that whites were almost peripheral to the issues . It's hard to argue with her . After all , slaves were suffering for two hundred years while whites were engaged in " the pursuit of happiness " for themselves alone . Yet her anger flares up on occasion , and it seems misplaced to me . " I don't have much patience with people who say that [ abolition ] was difficult because of political circumstances , " or something like that . I hope future historians are kinder to us than our present historians are to Americans of the 1860s . Slavery should never have been sanctioned under the Constitution but if allowances hadn't been made , the South would not have joined the Union , and who knows what would have happened . It was the slaves that paid the price for that union . Given that it was already in place , what could Lincoln have done about slavery that he did not in fact do ? Declare it illegal at the firing of the first shot ? Hardly . It was an explosive issue . Kentucky , Missouri , Maryland , and Delaware were slave states that did not secede . Any attempt to turn the CW from a fight to preserve the union into a fight to free the blacks might have turned those states back into the Southern camp . Moreover , Lincoln's support in the legislature depended on Democrats , and Republicans too , who were opposed to any attempt to make the CW into a struggle for black freedom . If Lincoln lost his majority in congress he might have lost the whole game . As it was he jumped at the first chance to issue his Emancipation Proclamation ( which was far from a complete proclamation of emancipation ) . Lincoln wanted to do this from a position of strength , so that it wouldn't seem a panicky move . The occasion he used as an excuse was the battle of Antietam , which he declared a victory . ( Some " victory . " ) Fields was wrong , too , in saying that we're still fighting the CW today . The chief issues of the war have been resolved . There is no more slavery . African-Americans can vote if they want to . They can take whatever empty seat on the bus is available . Affirmative action works to their benefit . If she means that " social equality " has still not been achieved , she's quite correct . One of the reasons perfect equality hasn't been achieved is that the achievement would involve our completely ignoring the fact of race in this country , and at this point it's inconceivable . It's not simply that white people carry around a lot of baggage from the past , but that African-Americans do too . To ask that contemporary African-Americans give up the social cohesiveness and group loyalty that the suffering of their ancestors earned for them is asking a great deal . Social equality is just not a practical goal in a pluralistic society . ( " Pluralism " might be roughly translated as " voluntary segregation . " ) Equality depends on everyone's ability - - and willingness - - to ignore race and ethnicity . I'm all for it . These tribal loyalties are nothing if not bothersome . ( They are poised to lead us into yet another war . ) Burns's series shows one earth-shattering step that has brought that still impossible goal a little closer than it was .
