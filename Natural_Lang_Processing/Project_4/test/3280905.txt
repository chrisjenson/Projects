My God . . . That Damned Big Gun !	Anyone acquainted with many of my reviews notices my background as a history major . Frequently I lament the fact that in pursuit of movie making that will turn into box office gold the studios ( especially American ones ) will ignore historical events or places . This is true about Ancient Greek History ( pace the two films about Themopylae , and the two films about Alexander the Great - where is a decent films about Pericles ? ) . It is also true about 18th-19th Century Spanish history . In particular , Napoleon's first major military goof : his invasion of the Iberian Peninsular in 1808 ( four years before his better remembered goof , his invasion of Russia ) . " War And Peace " is such a classic novel that it has been made and remade as film and television series several times , so we know what happened in Russia pretty well . But the events in what Napoleon's " chancre sore " in Spain and Portugal are barely noted . I recall the Jeannette MacDonald - Allan Jones operetta film " The Firefly " . There is a degree of involvement in the plot of " Anthony Adverse " ( toward the end ) . Later there was that film with Tony Franciosa about Goya at the royal court , which dealt a little bit with the inept Count Godoy . But the actual events of the rise and fall of French involvement in the Peninsula are never mentioned . Not even ( as far as I know - please tell me if I'm wrong ) a movie about Sir John Moore ( Wellington's model as a commander ) and his death in the retreat from Corunna ( it would have been a great film for British morale after Dunkirk ) . I don't know how " The Pride And The Passion " got started as a project . It is based on a minor novel of C . S . Forester , and that can be the reason . Forester struck Hollywood gold twice , first with his short novel " The African Queen " ( about events in British and German colonies in Africa in 1914 ) , and then with " Captain Horatio Hornblower " , the film with Gregory Peck about the adventures of Forester's fictional British Captain in the Napoleonic Wars . I suspect since Peck and his film did well in the movie houses , it was thought a land based Forester tale would do just as well . So they chose this idiocy . The plot deals with Anglo-Spanish cooperation in moving a heavy siege gun to a fortified town in order to breach the walls . The officer sent in command is played by Cary Grant . If his attempt to do American Revolutionary History , " The Howards Of Virginia " , showed to be less than his fans expected , this film demonstrated he should not do British military history . His performance is dominated by his costume and the scenery . He is supposed to have a romance with the Spanish woman played by Sophia Loren ( and an actual romance between them began in the course of the film ) but the visual record does not excite viewers passions . Frank Sinatra played an ex-priest , also interested in Loren ( she is supposed to have split feelings here ) . He resuscitates his hesitant and mediocre performance as a priest from " The Miracle Of The Bells " . If the three leads are fumbling about in the film it is doomed . That , plus the boring details of how to bring that huge siege gun over mountains and through valleys is just not the stuff for this film ( although the later movie , " Fitzcarraldo " , demonstrated that a madman's attempts to push an ocean liner through the Amazon jungle to Manaosh shows a great film might be made from a similar story ) . Looking back , the only thing I liked was that the story showed the French as well as the Anglo-Spanish sides , so we watched as the French General ( Theodore Bikel , in the one competent performance in the film ) tries to keep tabs on the progress and make preparations to thwart its effects . I give it a " 3 " . . . and that's for a side issue which I liked . Marty Feldman had a funny television show in the 1970s that was briefly shown in the U . S . He did a take off on " The Pride And The Passion " , about two inept soldiers ordered to deliver a cannon to a particular spot , who constantly get fired at by the French . In the end the cannon is delivered by the wounded pair ( they have casts on their arms and legs ) and they arm it , aim it , and pull the lanyard . Nothing happens . The idiots go in front of the cannon to check it , and it blows up killing them . A voice over ( suitably basso in tone ) , states , " They died because they could not live . . . . They live in the clouds forever , where stupid heroes die at the ends of movies like this ! ! " For allowing Feldman and his writers to come up with that , the movie did have a little redeeming feature to it . . . albeit one not planned by the production .
How to wreck a successful sit-com combination .	I admit that I do like GILLIGAN'S ISLAND . Idiot show that it was , the cast ( despite rumors of personality clashes ) blended perfectly and the stories , while predictable , were funny . And I suspect that I have the support of most television viewers about this . When I watched the antics of Bob Denver , Alan Hale Jr . , Jim Backus , and the others I never expected it was the equivalent of Shakespeare , but I normally felt humored after 30 minutes . GILLIGAN actually lasted three years on television in terms of new episodes ( except for a couple of television movies in the late 1970s ) , Bob Denver moved on to a now forgotten comedy THE GOOD GUYS with Herb Edelman and Joyce Van Patton ( and later Jim Backus , as Edelman's disapproving father-in-law ) . It lasted two years . Then Denver got offered this show . Regretfully he accepted it . I have pointed out that there have been only three really good western sit-coms that have popped up on television : MAVERICK , BEST OF THE WEST , and F-TROOP . There were also two others of mediocrity only : PISTOLS ' N PETTICOATS and RANGO . But DUSTY'S TRAIL makes RANGO ( whose sole asset was Tim Conway ) look like it was written by William Congreve or George Bernard Shaw or Oscar Wilde . Basically DUSTY'S TRAIL replaced the situation of Gilligan , the Skipper , the Howells , Mary Ann , Ginger , and the Professor being on that deserted island , and put Gilligan and the Skipper , the Howells , and Ginger into a stagecoach going west . Now the central idea of GILLIGAN'S ISLAND was the isolation of the castaways on that island , and how they face weekly threats to their existence . It works , oddly enough ( still does on a serious note - the reality show SURVIVOR is identical to it , in that the last one to " survive " has not been voted " dead " and off the island by the others ) . But this can't be transferred to a stagecoach going through the American West of the 1870s . How can it ? You have threats ( natural disasters , buffalo stampedes , Indian wars , bandits ) , but you have plenty of settlements to go to . The writers tried to make it similar by making " Dusty " ( Denver ) a woefully inept guide . It's not quite the same thing . Moreover , although Forrest Tucker was a good actor ( and even a good comedian ) he was not as properly fussy as Alan Hale Jr . was in GILLIGAN'S ISLAND . I saw it twice , and mercifully have forgotten the content of the episodes . Because I like Tucker and Denver I am giving this a " 4 " , but only for them .
The Best of the Bad Films of the 1930s ?	Misinforming , pompous , self-righteous ( in the figure of the school official played by Joseph Forte ) , TELL YOUR CHILDREN ( better known as REEFER MADNESS ) is usually pushed as one of the worst films ever made . It made the Medved Brothers FIFTY WORST FILMS book , along with such dreck as ROBOT MONSTER , but is revived and revivable more than most of the titles in that list / book . Why ? My guess is that it is more than the idiotic view of marijuana cigarettes and drug addiction . Or the sometimes ridiculous dialog ( why would some teenager state that he never drinks that stuff , meaning he never drinks sodas ? ) . I think it is the fascination this film brings to us because it has things working for it , and it is unique for it's time and place , and it does give us a view of what the public of the 1930s would accept or reject for discussion . I mentioned a few days ago that the movie FLESH AND THE DEVIL ( from the 1920s ) had a bad script which should have built up on a theme of homosexual love between Lars Hanson and John Gilbert , the close friends competing for Greta Garbo . But , as I said , the America of Calvin Coolidge would not tolerate open discussion of homosexuality . So the two male stars had to use their all to show their friendship was deeper than a friendship . Similarly drug addiction was not a topic of deep discussion in the 1920s or 1930s or earlier . Yet it existed . Mark Twain , in his AUTOBIOGRAPHY , mentions Charles Webster , his business partner whose mistakes caused the failure of their publishing house , as addicted to over-the-counter drugs , and states that in America ( in the 1890s ) it was easy to become a self-poisoner this way . That comment is the sole one I have ever found in 19th Century literature regarding drug addiction , and Twain's Autobiography was not completely published until the 1960s , edited by Charles Neider . The movie record is tricky . I have seen only two films that mention drugs at all . One is Charlie Chaplin's EASY STREET , where the tramp ( here a policeman confronting Eric Campbell and his gang in a slum ) accidentally sits on a needle with some drug ( cocaine , I suspect ) and it gives his adrenalin a lift . The other is another Chaplin film ( whose title I unfortunately can't recall ) wherein somebody is shown using the " notorious nose powders " . Leave it to America's greatest writer and the English-born film giant to be the only two who had the guts to discuss the matter . But aside from them there was nothing . No film of stature was made of the trafficking in drugs until TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH . . . IN THE 1940s ! Hard to believe isn't it ? Yet we know , if studying the history of organized crime and earlier criminals , that gangs did deal in drugs . It was even then a big business . Capone had a whole section of his empire in Chicago devoted to drug sales , along with prostitution , with illegal booze , and with union racketeering . But it rarely was talked about . Can anyone recall a film with Robinson or Cagney or Raft or Bogart dealing with drugs ? The Chinese opium trade was an exception : but it was basically seen as involving Chinese addicts only , not most Americans ( a very naive view , but one clung to by most Americans ) . Now into this hole comes this two-bit film which tries to tackle the threat of drugs to American Youth . It would not be until Samuel Fuller's UNDERWORLD USA in the 1950s that the subject is tackled again so forcefully ( Fuller , being a better director , and having Cliff Robertson and Robert Emhart in his cast , does better with the subject ) . So from want of any alternative , REEFER MADNESS is in a unique position to be notable from the start . It also is lucky to have at least two notable actors . Dave O'Brien is better recalled for the many Pete Smith comedy shorts he did , but his " Ralph " driven crazy to kill another character by reefers is his best remembered performance . Actually , while we realize today that reefers don't do that kind of damage to most people as this film suggests , O'Brien shows by his skittishness and twisting precisely what drug addiction to say cocaine or morphine would do to people - particularly when he is forced into hiding and is somewhat going cold turkey at times . He had done his homework , if the screenwriters did not . The other was Carleton Young . Young would become among the last actors adopted in the John Ford circle in the late 1950s and early 1960s , most notably in THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALENCE and SERGEANT RUTLEDGE . Under that master's hands he gave wonderful performances . His performance as the drug dealer Jack Perry is a fair one , given the lesser director he has here . So the film does have some things going for it , even if it over the top in condemning reefers over stronger drugs . I know it is no masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination , but it is not the worst film in the world - it's the best bad film of the 1930s .
" The British Museum Had Lost It's Charm . . . . "	Like so many of his films , because Alfred Hitchcock became such a great director his name became a hallmark for suspense . To attach his name with any project gives that project a " leg up " . This happens with many major directors : Capra , Welles , Huston . . . the list is simply endless . Their fans think they can do no wrong , even if the film isn't that good . BLACKMAIL was Hitchcock's last silent movie , and first sound film . It was also one of the first two sound films in British motion pictures . So it is historically significant - a milestone film everyone is aware of , but one few necessarily watch . He does ( in my view ) one really good sequence in it : the robbery and chase in the British Museum . Fortunately this is in the conclusion of the film , and it does help the movie that it is at the end ( it raises the excitement of what really is a dull movie ) . But that said , the defects of the film's plot , and the transition to sound planning , stand out . Noteworthy too , by the way , is that it is the second most famous titled work that Cyril Richard showed up in that has survived . Here we see the young Cyril as an artist , a lady's man ( which is surprising ) , a would-be rapist , and a corpse to push the plot along . Not quite the same thing as his dashing and vigorous " Captain Hook " in the television version of PETER PAN , but sometimes artists can't pick and choose what they will be memorable for . If you are interested , while looking over his movie / television credits , I noted the next interesting movie he did pop up in was THE WINSLOW BOY ( 1949 ) in an extra role . His best grown-up role on stage , as " Sir Sir " in THE ROAR OF THE GREASEPAINT THE SMELL OF THE CROWD , unfortunately was never filmed or taped ( but there is a record of his and Anthony Newley's singing ) . As is pointed out Donald Calthrop gave the best performance , as the blackmailer , of the three leads . The hero and heroine are somewhat colorless in comparison to Calthrop and Richard . The plot too is somewhat stupid ( as also was pointed out ) because Anya Ondra could have defied the blackmailer by showing she was attacked and defended herself ( as again was pointed out ) . The behavior of her boyfriend ( John Longden ) , however , is less defensible . Policeman are not supposed to tamper with evidence . However , her relationship with Longden points the way to Sylvia Sidney's with John Loder in SABOTAGE , and Theresa Wright's with MacDonald Carey's in SHADOW OF A DOUBT , and Cary Grant's with Eva Marie Saint's in NORTH BY NORTHWEST ( among other Hitchcock films - and better ones ) . Hitchcock apparently re-shot the whole film with sound ( and secretly ) because of an order from the studio to only do the last reel in sound . He felt it was silly and so secretly re-shot it all in sound . BAD IDEA ALF . The problem with a last minute change like that ( as Hitchcock would have soon realized , but never admitted ) is that you need a full script with complete dialog to carry off something like a total film in sound . If one watches BLACKMAIL , for two thirds of it the " sound " is quite limited to very occasional talking . There are huge periods when people aimlessly move about without saying anything . It's very annoying after awhile : Are we to see this as a silent movie ( where this would work ) ? Well , turn off the sound ! But what are they saying ? Well then , put on the sound but give them something worthwhile to hear and without long , pointless gaps ! Hitch tried to bridge the two , and flopped . His fans admire his being the first , and this being his first " talkie " . Well and good , but it does not begin to compare with the films he began to make from 1934 - 1939 in England , and the films he made in Hollywood .
You had trouble , my friends . . . right here in Manitoba .	Cecil B . DeMille's fame as a leading movie director is still secure because of his innovative nature . He certainly developed spectacle movies , and even today he is remembered as the pioneer . But that does not blind us to his flaws . His characters are not three dimensional usually but black or white in personality . His dialog is for the birds . He does fall into stereotypes too often . It is understandable that the Medveds included " Northwest Mounted Police " among the 50 worst movies ever made . Yet one can't easily dismiss it . It was DeMille's first color movie . It was the second of four films with Gary Cooper , one of four made Goddard and one of three made with Robert Preston . Preston made good action films in this period but was always in support . In the early 1950s he returned to the stage and the fame that eluded him in Hollywood . Came " The Music Man " , " The Lion In Winter " , and " Mack and Mabel " and the recognition of Preston the adept entertainer . Came the call back to Hollywood for his filmed performances as Harold Hill and Toddy ( in " Victor / Victoria " ) . Preston was that rarity : an actor who proved his star qualities in middle-age . DeMille would never have been his kind of director : he had no light touch for comedy , and he did not do musicals . Still , for some good straight performances as doomed weaklings , Preston did well in this film , " Union Pacific " , and " Reap the Wild Wind " . The film's historic content is interesting . DeMille's earlier historic films ( " Cleopatra " , " Sign of the Cross " , " The Crusades " ) dealt with old world history . But after the last DeMille concentrated on American history with " The Plainsman " , " The Buccaneer " , " Union Pacific " , " Reap The Wild Wind " , and " The Unconquered " . Even the modern " The Story of Dr . Wassell " was based on a true tale connected with the current war in the Pacific . Because of his American History period " Northwest Mounted Police " is an odd film . Cooper's character is the only link in it to American history in the 1880s , as a Texas Ranger after George Bancroft ( Le Corbeau ) for murder . The film is set firmly in Canada which was the scene of two revolts of the Metis people under Louis Riel in 1870 and 1885 . As such this becomes somewhat unique among the historic films of Hollywood . Canada does poorly regarding it's history in Hollywood . This movie actually covers one of the most troubling moments of modern Canadian history : the fate of Louis Riel . We don't know about it down here . Riel was a lawyer and teacher with some mental problems . Riel helped found the provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan , thus making him one of Canadian history's founding fathers . But he was also aware that French Canadians and his Metis people got a suspiciously short deal from the British Canadians in Canada . Canada was firmly controlled by the Tory party led by Sir John MacDonald . MacDonald was corrupt but made one of the great comebacks in political history in 1879 . Riel had led a revolt in 1870 which was crushed . He fled to the U . S . , and spent some time in asylums here . He was released , taught school in Montana , and then returned to Canada ( illegally ) in 1884 . He organized a second Metis revolt , which nearly succeeded in winning an independent state . A British army crushed it in 1885 , captured Riel , and he was tried for treason . Lives had been lost , and property destroyed . MacDonald's son had been sent to Manitoba to run the province , and he had been humiliated by the revolt . Riel , however , had some legitimate gripes about the treatment of French Canadians , and the Metis . The treason trial came , and he was found guilty . MacDonald apparently never had a moment's hesitation about what to do . He refused to stop Riel's execution . The Tory Party in Canada has never recovered from this mistake . The backbone of Liberal Party strength ( to the current day ) is French Canadien Quebec - they have never forgiven the Tories for not acting humanely to Louis ( and putting him in a Canadian asylum for life ) . DeMille is not totally anti-Riel . Riel is not unlike the American John Brown ( inthe contemporary film " Santa Fe Trail " ) , who is murderous and possibly insane but fighting for certain principles that actually get the audience's sympathy . In this film , Riel is committed to a Metis revolt and state and he will stop at nothing to prevent it's success . But he also is shown as a kindly man to young children ( he was a school teacher , remember ) . He is trying to save a way of life that a juggernaut threatens . And he is resigned to his fate at the end , realizing that in dying he may still win ( which happened ) . We need a subsidiary villain like Van Heflin in " Sante Fe Trail " who is villainous for money . Here it is Bancroft , a murderer and criminal who is Riel's assistant . His villainy is passed down through his genes to his daughter ( Goddard ) who tempts and betrays Preston . One wonders , had Riel formed a successful government and state , how long before Le Corbeau would have arranged an " accident " or " assassination " ( by a " Tory " agent , of course ) of Riel , in order to cement his control over the Metis nation . So when he gets his just deserts at the end , unlike poor Louis , we are cheered by it . One has to congratulate DeMille in trying to be fair to Louis , when he could have just made his a super villain .
Paris Champagne can still fall flat	William Holden really reached stardom in 1950 with " Sunset Blvd . " , and subsequently gained an Oscar for " Stalag 17 " . A man with one of the most effective screen voices , he also was handsome in a realistic way . But it took Holden a dozen or so years of struggle in Hollywood before Billy Wilder put him into " Sunset Blvd . " Imagine his fascination when ( in 1954 ) Wilder cast him in " Sabrina " opposite another new star of the first rank , Ms Audrey Hepburn . Hepburn had only been in a handful of movies in the very late 1940s and early 1950s before William Wyler got her charm and intelligence to the world audience's in " Roman Holiday " ( and also won her an Oscar ) . It is true that one of her pre - " Roman Holiday " films was " The Lavandar Hill Mob " ( she had a walk-on scene as Alec Guiness's girlfriend ) , but " Roman Holiday " was like her fourth movie ! Yet she was now Holden's co-star . Most people like " Sabrina " ( this writer does ) , but it has it's critics - mostly aiming at Humphrey Bogart as the third co-star . I think it is an unfair point to belabor the age difference between Linus ( Bogart ) and David Larrabee ( Holden ) , as the screenplay does suggest that Linus is the older , more reclusive brother from the start . More important though was Billy Wilder's serious cast management problems . Hepburn and Holden got along with him very well , and he would work with both again . But Bogart was another matter . Bogie did not get along with either Wilder or Holden , and had little tolerance ( why ? ) for Hepburn . So it was a chore to get the film into the can . It's nice to note that before Bogie died Wilder and he made up their differences . But just as " Roman Holiday " opened up a lifetime friendship between Hepburn and co-star Gregory Peck ; just as " Golden Boy " opened up a lifetime of gratitude and friendship between newcomer Holden and star Barbara Stanwick ; " Sabrina " opened up a friendship between Hepburn and Holden ( after all they had Bogie sniping at both of them ) . So for years the two surviving co-stars of " Sabrina " hoped to work with each other in another , friendlier film . In 1962 Holden's contract with Paramount finally ended , and his last film for the studio was " Paris - When It Sizzles " . And finally he and Audrey were able to do a film together again . Unfortunately there was one serious difference - " Sabrina " was based on a successful play called " Sabrina Fair " , and ( whatever problems among the crew ) it stands up fairly well . " Paris - When It Sizzles " ( how much one would like Bogie to be around now to say something ironically nasty about that title ! ) has one of the worst film scripts imaginable for a film that has cast that includes Holden , Hepburn , Tony Curtis ( in bits and pieces ) , Marlene Dietrich , Noel Coward , and even Mel Ferrer . Hell , even Frank Sinatra ends up on the sound-track . It's supposed to be a charming spoof on screenplay hackdom . Actually there is a pretty good film about that written in the 1930s ( based on a successful play ) called " Boy Meets Girl " , and starring Pat O'Brien , Jimmy Cagney , and Ralph Bellamy . To imagine that this one is superior is an insult to the fun and craftsmanship that the authors of that farce ( the Spivaks ) and Pat , Jimmy , and Ralph brought to audiences from 1938 on . Here Holden is now more rumpled and with more of the alcoholic problem that would dodge him until his accidental death in 1981 . He has been given an advance to start work on a screenplay set in Paris called " The Girl Who Stole The Eiffel Tower " . Holden has spent part , but has not begun the work - but a typist ( Hepburn ) shows up to help him with the screenplay . There is a film with Charles Laughton and Franchot Tone based on a novel by Georges Simonon about Inspector Maigret called " The Man On The Eiffel Tower " ( 1949 ) , and there was also an actual fraud perpetrated twice ( believe it or not ) of a so-called " Count " who sold the " doomed " tower to scrap metal dealers ! What we see is Holden's self-contempt , for he has degraded his once good abilities by becoming a cliché master . The creativity he needs is apparently dead . As one idea after another is tried out by Holden and Hepburn ( they shoot or re-shoot the imagined script and again and again , changing scenes and motivations , and even making the film a family entertainment when it can be sexy ) we watch an unwatchable mess take shape . Holden's idea finally becomes what if the costliest movie shot in years is stolen by an international thief and held for ransom ? How would the studio owner ( Coward ) and the police ( Gregoire Aslan and Tony Curtis ) react ? And what is the role of the mysterious girl ( Hepburn ) in this ? The results is not good - it's a shambles about making a script on one upside down cliché after another . Unless a spoof like that is written seriously and carefully it is never done well . Supposedly Holden was drying out just before the film , and as it was the last on his contract his studio did not care how he would be seen in the work . But it was a really lousy film - and Paramount held back release for a couple of years . Unfortunately , after the promise of " Sabrina " , " Paris - When It Sizzles " was the last time Holden and Hepburn worked together . For the pleasure of seeing that , and Curtis ( belatedly ) brought in as a supporting actor ( second detective of the Surete under Aslan ) , it's worth a " 5 " out of " 10 " . Coward is dressed up like a Roman Emperor at a costume party . That is also of interest - but he has little to do except to act like Noel Coward above it all .
Verne's Columbiad - reduced in effect .	After TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA and AROUND THE WORLD IN EIGHTY DAYS it is most likely that the most popular of Jules Verne's titles ( the ones that most people are familiar with ) is his 1865 novel FROM THE EARTH TO THE MOON , together with it's first sequel , the 1870 novel AROUND THE MOON . What fascinates everyone is that for all the errors we now know of Verne's huge cannon idea ( it would crush and vaporize the space travelers before they left the cannon's mouth ) he was on target on so many points . He felt the Americans would do it first ( we did - though barely ) ; It would be sent from Florida ( near where Cape Kennedy is located , by the way ) ; Texas would be important in the project ( in the novel Texas wants the honor of being the site of the cannon , but in reality Nasa's central space tracking center is in Houston ) ; The capsule would be bullet shaped ( not quite correct , but look at the rockets we used ) ; The capsule would return to the earth and land in the Atlantic , to be recovered by an American battleship . Nice guesswork ( or homework ) Jules ! To be fair to Verne , even his cannon idea was not a bad one - it was more plausible than Cyrano de Bergerac's bottles of morning dew ( which his poetic fancy said would lift the traveler ) or Poe's free flying balloon in HANS PFALL . But what is not noticed by most readers ( due to translations ) is Verne's social and political satire . He liked Americans , but he recognized our bellicosity , self-image building ( we always did it better than anyone else ) and our economic and political expansionism . Verne , like many Frenchmen , supported Lincoln and the North in the Civil War , especially after the Emancipation Proclamation . In 1887 he wrote a two volume novel NORTH AND SOUTH , in which the Confederates are the villains . But he saw American enterprise as haphazard and not well planned . He was very critical of it in THE FLOATING ISLAND , where greed by American millionaires destroys a remarkable artificial island . Even in his first published novel , FIVE WEEKS IN A BALLOON , at a philosophical moment one of the characters says that if the world ever is destroyed an American will have a hand in it . So in the novel , the Baltimore Gun Club members are all leading engineers who helped the Northern cause by building better guns and cannon . Most of them are missing limbs as a result . The President of the club , J . P . Barbicane ( in some versions his name is " Impey " Barbicane ) has his limbs . His closest associate , the club's secretary , J . T . Maston , has most of his body , but has one hook for a hand . They are the only members with " in tact " bodies . The club is seeking something to do with it's time , after the Confederacy collapses . Barbicane suggests building the " Columbiad " ( which , by the way , is the cannon , not the projectile ) to travel or communicate with the moon . The plan is barely presented when Maston suggests using the cannon instead to annex Mexico ! See - Verne has our bellicosity down quite pat . Barbicane has a wartime rival , one Captain Nicholl . Nicholl specialized in better and better armor . Barbicane specialized in better and better shells to pierce the armor . Nicholl will soon become the leading critic of the scheme . Verne ( in real life ) was a friend of the prominent aeronaut and photographer , Nadar . Nadar became the model for the French adventurer Michel Ardan ( note the anagram last name for " Nadar " ) who proposes traveling in the projectile to the moon . Barbicane and Nicholl end up joining him ( while Maston will be in charge of carefully following their travel by powerful telescope ) . The flight actually had great accuracy in detailing the length of the trip ( four days ) and in showing the amazing effect of weightlessness ( Verne noted that by leaving the gravity field of earth this would result ) . The capsule never lands on the moon ( it couldn't , because if it had it would not have been capable of getting back . Verne explains that there is a miscalculation in the calculations of the trajectory . This enables the moon to help send the capsule back to earth . Nadar / Ardan is not in the movie . Nicholl does not become so completely involved and willing to work with Barbicane as the novel shows . George Sanders ' Stuyvesant Nicholl ( " Stuyvesant " ? ) remains hostile to Joseph Cotton's Victor Barbicane ( what happened to " Impey " ) up to a few minutes before the conclusion . There is no power X in the novel - no new energy source . The movie was made in the 1950s , so the public had to think that Verne was thinking in terms of atomic power . Actually he never did . There is no romance between the children of Sanders and Cotton . These changes in the film help weaken the film in comparison to the novel ( which still reads well - try to get the translation by Walter Miller that is the best in English ) . This was not the only film version of the novel . The classic early film by George Melies , A TRIP TO THE MOON , has a period charm that makes one forget it's cardboard backgrounds ( and it's projectile in the eye of the man in the moon is a classic moment of cinema ) . And then there was the film ROCKET TO THE MOON which turned the story into an all-star comedy with Burl Ives , Terry-Thomas , Lionel Jeffries , and Dennis Price . Verne was not finished with his travelers either , after AROUND THE MOON . In 1889 he wrote THE PURCHASE OF THE NORTH POLE , where the Gun Club decides to use the Columbiad to alter the tilt of the globe . Ardan does not reappear , but Barbicane , Nicholl , and Marston do . It is not as good a novel as the first two .
Seen Once Many Years Ago	I have not seen this film since it was shown on television somewhere in the early 1960s . And the reason I recall it at all was not the singing of Alice Faye , nor the antics of Joan Davis ( a sadly forgotten comedian ) . It was the appearance of Jimmy Durante alone , or with Fred Allen . Durante's film career has not gotten studied as much as other great film clowns , but it lasted far longer than most - from the 1930s ( when he was Buster Keaton's " partner " in a series of comedies ) to the 1960s ( when he was the criminal whose " kicking the bucket " sets off IT'S A MAD , MAD , MAD , MAD WORLD ) . He did have lead roles in some of them , like THE GREAT RUPERT , but Jimmy usually was in support - though strong support ( like in IT HAPPENED IN BROOKLYN ) . Allen's best film work would be in IT'S IN THE BAG , and LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR - and later in WE'RE NOT MARRIED and O'HENRY'S FULL HOUSE . But he is amusing here - his " Gabby " is not a great agent , though he tries hard . To me , the scene that best showed Allen's humor in this film was a brief scene where he was eating a peach , and shaves it with a razor to remove the peach fuzz . There is also a moment I fondly recall of Allen and Durante speaking to each other with office jargon using intercoms , and at the end , Durante getting up , walking across the room , and talking directly to Allen who was there all the time ! One final thing about this film - the steamboat turned into a nightclub by the girls is named the " General Fremont " and it breaks lose at the conclusion of the film . The same ship and conclusion was used some five years later by Laurel & Hardy in the conclusion of the best of their last films , JITTERBUGS .
The Cursed Black Pearl of the Borgias	In 1903 Arthur Conan Doyle wrote a short story called " The Adventure of the Six Napoleons " . In it Inspector Lestrade tells Holmes and Watson of a strange series of seemingly unrelated crimes in which houses are burglarized and bric-a-brac smashed . Is it the work of a madman or an intelligent criminal ? Holmes discovers the running link in the crimes - in each case a cheap bust of Emperor Napoleon I was smashed . Then the crimes become deadlier - a man is murdered at the site of one of the smashups ( the home of a newspaperman named Harker - a name retained in the movie by a minor victim ) . Holmes soon finds out that the busts came from a store where a man who fits the description of the criminal worked . This criminal is captured . The final one of the six busts is found , and broken before Watson and Lestrade by Holmes . And out pops the world's rarest black pearl , the Borgia Pearl . Of course the story is more fully fleshed out by Conan Doyle . His villain is an ethnic type - so there is a little racism ( though nothing like the racism met with in G . K . Chesterton or R . Austin Freeman ) . However the story is not totally like that in the film . The villain , Beppo , is not a criminal mastermind - not a Moriarty type . He has a clever idea , not one of many clever ideas . And he kills his victim when he is confronted by an enemy ( something totally unplanned ) . There is no " creature of the night " figure of dread but just Beppo . So the film version is ( except for the pearl and the busts of Napoleon ) a rewrite . Giles Connover and the Creeper ( or , as Lestrade calls him , " the Oxton ' Orror " ) are movie innovations , and both are quite effective , thanks to Miles Manders acting and ( unfortunately ) Rondo Hatton's appearance . But they helped make the film better than average . So does Rathbone . He does a disguise act at the start ( as good as his song and dance act in " THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES " ) . He also has a go at imitating the voice of another actor in the film ( and he does it nicely ) and a disguise at the end . Nice balance there . Bruce adds some good comedy , especially when he thinks fast and shows he too can hide the pearl . Also note his scene where he tries to reassure a visitor that he is as good at deductions as Holmes was . Altogether a different story from the Doyle original , but it is a good film on it's own merits .
Minor film comedy - but the first to tackle " misinformation "	I saw this about thirty years ago , late at night and have never seen it revived . This is understandable , for despite a good cast and director ( Michael Curtiz , of all people ) it is not a great comedy but a passingly acceptable one . Jane Wyman is a woman whose reputation for honesty is important regarding her job on a magazine that is run by Robert Douglas ( here not playing one of his politically ambitious historical villains for a change ) . She is enjoying a day on a boat when she is sunk by an experimental craft being tested by Dennis Morgan . Morgan tries to keep her from exposing this little secret , but she does not see that a government project is involved - only her credibility . So Morgan and the U . S . government do everything they can think of to get her branded a liar . And Wyman fights back to save her reputation . One highpoint ( noted in another of these reviews ) is the brief appearance of William Frawley to present an award to Wyman . She expects it to be in recognition of her magazine work . Instead , it turns out to be an award from " THE LIAR'S CLUB " for best lie of the year . The film's weakness is that it probes a subject gingerly - probably because it was the first time anyone ever considered it . The subject is government use of " misinformation " to hide activity that it does not wish to advertise at all . In the years since 1949 we are fully aware that all levels of government use misinformation - that they deny events happened or brand witnesses as liars , or frame the witnesses with evidence or other unknown / unexpected witnesses . But here it was limited to Wyman who fights without an assist by her magazine , and Morgan , who does what he can to discredit her , but finds he is falling in love with her . As an original in tackling this government vice , I mark that the movie is a " 6 " for being original . But on it's own , based on comic entertainment value , it is lucky to be a " 5 " .
This Can't Be Shakespeare	Usually Rogers and Hart are credited with the second great book musical with their 1941 flop ( later hit ) " Pal Joey " . That is the show that is most likely to be revived of all their book shows ( although " On Your Toes " was successfully revived a few years ago ) . However , they had several shows with some type of book involved that blended with the songs ( and did not just set up song cues ) . One of the first was " The Boys From Syracuse " . It predates Cole Porter's similar Shakespeare based musical comedy , " Kiss Me Kate " by a decade . While that was based on " The Taming of the Shrew " , this was based on " The Comedy of Errors " . It had a flamingly good score , such as " This Can't Be Love " , " Sing For Your Supper " , " Come With Me Where The Wine Is Free " , " He and She " , and " Falling in Love With Love " . It was a successful show , starring Eddie Albert , Ronald Graham , Murial Angelus , Marcy Westcott , Wynn Murray , Jimmy Savo , and Teddy Hart . It also stuck pretty close to the original play . Came this 1940 version , only two years after the Broadway hit . It was jazzed up , with a number of anachronistic " jokes " ( set in ancient Greece , someone makes the announcement , " Good evening Mr . and Mrs . Ephesus , and all the ships at sea ! " , imitating the radio introduction of Walter Winchell's show ) . The Duke of Ephesus was played by that normal tower of strength , comedian Charles Butterworth . Eddie Albert and Ronald Graham played the two Antipholos twins on stage , Allan Jones played both brothers in the film . The twin Dromios were Savo and Hart on stage - an interesting piece of casting . The two comics looked very much alike , and Teddy Hart was the younger brother of lyricist Larry . Savo was a stage comedian who critics compared to Chaplin . Both were known to movie audiences ( Savo not too successfully ) . Hart had been in supporting parts in " Three Men On A Horse " and " After The Thin Man " among other films . For some reason the role of both Dromio was given to Joe Penner . Penner is one of the mysteries of 1930s humor . He was one of a set of " zanies " who were popular in the early and middle 1930s . They included Jack " Baron Von Munchausen " Pearl , " the Mad Russian " , Parkyarkarkus on Eddie Cantor's program . Many of them had some catch phrase that swept the country , like the Mad Russian's " How do you do ? " , or Pearl's " Vas you dere Sharley ? " when his companion dared to question him . Penner had two : " Yooou nahsty man ! " and " Wanna buy a duck ? " ( he had a pet duck named " Googoo " ) . There was no questioning of their popularity , but this was during the depression . Their success shows that in that trying period , people were desperate to laugh at anything . Heard nowadays most of their material is trying , particularly the inane and witless Penner . It is odd that the only reason to recall Penner's " Yooou nahsty man ! " catch phrase is that a murderer and amateur nightclub singer named Kenneth Neu used it in a song lyric he wrote in prison , awaiting execution ( in 1935 ) . Neu used it to refer to the hangman . Hardly a reason to really recall Penner at all . But it is Penner's presence ( twice over ) in the film , so we are stuck with it . Jones sings his portion of the songs well . Irene Hervey , Rosemary Lane , and Martha Lane do nicely in this film . So does Alan Mowbray , dependable as ever . Even Butterworth is tolerable to an extent . But Penner sinks it . It was his last real chance for movie success , but as he had little to offer in the way of talent to begin with what could one really expect .
Seen Once Years Ago - But Memory of it is Oddly Warm	It is curious when one recalls a mood in a movie , and one or two moments that seem to raise it above the average . Such was the case of THE RINGER which I saw over 20 years ago on Channel 9 in New York . One summer , for the entire month of August , Channel 9 just ran British films . Many were very effective crime dramas or mysteries , like John Mills ' MR . DENNING DRIVES NORTH ( which I reviewed some time ago ) . This one , from the little I recall seeing , was intriguing and probably well worth watching . Herbert Lom is up to his usual " low " activities : He is a solicitor who has made a pot of money , at the expense of his clients . So he has many , many enemies out there . One of them has started sending him small threatening notes , and the police are called in to protect him . Problem is , he is such a despicable type even the police are not that happy about helping him . Among the police who are keeping an eye on him is a police psychiatrist named Dr . Lomond , played by Donald Wolfit . And here was one of the two delights of the film ( the other being watching Mr . Lom go through his normal low paces ) . Donald Wolfit was one of the great stage actors of the 1910 - 1950 period in England , but he has been forgotten today . Although he was admired for many of his Shakespearean performances , he was of the old theatrical manager tradition like Sir Henry Irving or Sir Johnston Forbes-Robertson . This tradition was being replaced by a more natural acting style practiced by Olivier , Guilgud , Redgrave , Guiness , Richardson , Ashcroft , Evans , and Thorndyke . Not that the latter could not blunder or bluster on occasion , but they distinctly toned down the histrionics . Wolfit did the reverse - so that when watching his filmed performances today one has to admit he can be very , very florid at times ( such as in his 1954 SVENGALI ) . But when he made an effort to control his proclivities for chewing scenery he was very , very good . His Dr . Lomond is one of those attempts . The psychologist keeps restoring a degree of calm and rationality to the proceedings of the police and Lom regarding the unknown threat to the latter . So that the audience welcomes his comments and behavior - although as the film progresses an issue arises : just who is Dr . Lomond anyway ? You see , it becomes known to Mai Zetterling ( Lom's girlfriend ) that Lomond's police credentials seem to be flawed . Who exactly is he ? It becomes a game of " cat and mouse " between the arrogant , but suspicious Lom , and the quiet and patient Wolfit . I can only add that when the moment comes for the final confrontation it really is a memorable shocker . It was a clever film , and I wish my memories were sharper about it . But I am aware . . . from what little I recall of it , the film was certainly deserving a rating of " 6 " - and probably should get one higher .
The Colonial Problem of Great Britain In The 1950s	CARLETON-BROWNE OF THE F . O . used to appear with some regularity in the New York metropolitan television area of the 1960s , but it was called " THE MAN IN THE COCKED HAT " . This was not unusual . The comedy " THE NAKED TRUTH " was called " YOUR PAST IS SHOWING " . I saw it twice back then , and remember a few points that have been downplayed in these reviews . SPOILERS AHEADIt was not as serious a film as it seems to be to some of the reviewers . Rather it touched on the serious because it dealt with the end of Britain's empire and the way the cold world politics of the U . S . and the U . S . S . R . got entwined everywhere . What was being shown in the satire was that Britain ( in the personality of it's man on the spot , Carleton-Browne ( Terry-Thomas ) ) was too civilized to handle the realities of the dark politics of the era ( keep in mind the film is British , so it is not really looking closely at the view of British policies and actions from the point of third world countries ) . The irony of the film is that those civilizing traits happens to be the unifying point that brings an end to the civil war bloodshed that is smashing the island kingdom of Gaillardia apart . After showing how behind the times the foreign office of Raymond Huntley and Terry-Thomas is , we are taken to Gaillardia . A play is being attended by the King and his oldest son and heir , both of whom are bored by it . One of them says something like , " I'm blow-ed if I stay here " . At that a bomb explodes killing them ( paging Alistair Sim in THE GREEN MAN ) . The younger son , Ian Bannen , returns to the island , only to find that his uncle ( John Le Messurier in an unusually ruthless and power-hungry role ) is there to tell him it would be wisest if he would abdicate now . Bannen , who has been living in England , is trying to make his country a successful constitutional monarchy like mother England . He calls in the British Foreign Office , as his local " support " is the corrupt Prime Minister ( Peter Sellers ) . The Foreign Office sends Terry-Thomas . He has no idea of what to do . The island is slowly splitting in half , due to the activities of Le Messurier and his candidate for the throne , a Princess of the house . Le Messurier does not know that the Princess ( Luciana Palluzzi ) has met the young Bannen when they both were returning home ( both had been in England ) . Actually she is just as set to set up the constitutional monarchy as Bannen is ( and as Le Messurier is not , nor - for that matter - as Sellers could care for ) . Unless you keep that in mind the plot of this seems aimless . Carleton-Browne ( in his fumbling ) comes up with a solution . It resembles the shamble solutions of East and West Germany ( until 1989 ) , Cypress ( until today ) , North and South Vietnam ( until 1975 ) , and North and South Korea . He sets up a dividing line for Gaillardia so that both parties will be satisfied . It is voted on by the U . N . Security Council without any problem . Then it turns out that the aggression that Le Messurier brought to the matter was due to the U . S . S . R . It seems that the Northern part of the island has a valuable mineral the Russians need . When Carleton-Browne tries to undo the agreement , because he had not known this , Russia says he can't . The British have been patrolling the demilitarized border area . Suddenly open civil war breaks out . Le Messurier thinks it is his opportunity , only to find his niece has a mind of her own , and it has no place for him as an adviser . Similarly ( earlier ) Bannen overhears Sellers offer to put the young king out of the way if Le Messurier will agree that he continue as Prime Minister of the reunited country . Bannen and Palluzzi both disappear , rendering their " pupper masters " useless . They only reappear when they confront Carleton-Browne - together they have formed a majority counter-insurgency to overthrow Le Messurier and Sellers . They are uniting to save the country . They do . Basically what happens at the end is that Bannen and Palluzzi will marry and bring a constitutional country ( based on Britain ) to the island . Le Messurier ( stunned and sad faced ) is going to retire to some hotel in Europe where ex-monarchs congregate at . He will be accompanied by Sellers . The comedy is in the film , but it is not consistent because of the commentary on modern diplomacy . Russia gets slapped for supporting dubious regimes ( it's supporting a monarchy here , of all things ) for raw materials . The U . S . is not directly affected ( it is Britain that is ) , so when a sequence of news headlines from Britain show what a disaster is about to happen , the American newspapers reflect some trivial items of passing interest . In the last sequence , symbolically , the U . S . and U . S . S . R . have sent teams to play a soccer match in front of the Gaillardians . Carleton-Browne , despite his naivety and bungling , has won a victory for British civility ( if not for the empire ) . He kicks the first soccer ball , as Sellers looks with patient interest , and an explosion occurs ( paging again , Alistair Sim ) . But a final newspaper headline mentions he is being awarded a knighthood for his wonderful success as a diplomat , while he recovers .
The Music Hall Scene	ABRACADAVER was a novel by Peter Lovesey about Sergeant Cribb and Constable Thackeray that deals with a homicide in a popular London Music Hall . My memories of this particular episode ( which you may notice I have saved for the end ) are somewhat limited . The idea of the plot is that the music hall artistes of the day ( the Dan Lenos and Vesta Tillys and Charles Coborns ) were popular figures with the public , but were not socially secure . It was only one hundred years or so of theatrical life in England ( and Europe , for that matter ) that separated the idea of the average performer as a vagabond from that of a performer as a special type of professional . In this story , the key to the plot is that the rich and powerful frequently can have the theaters to themselves on special occasions , where the material used by the performers was of a far more salacious and sexually suggestive nature than what they were usually performing before the regular audiences . Those audiences were only allowed to see material that passed the censorship of the Lord Chamberlain's office . But the aristocracy and the upper crust were a law in themselves , and they were not controlled by the Lord Chamberlain's office . The most memorable part of the plot was watching the acts of the music hall performers ( like one young woman singing , " My Boyfriend Is Up In THE BALCONY " ) . But while well made , it is not one of the best of the episodes .
Mr . Grant's Second Attempt to Break His Movie Image	It's entertaining enough to sit through , and it offers a light on a problem that would forever plague it's leading man , but let us face facts : MR . LUCKY was a World War II moral boosting propaganda film , and as such it is dated . It is set in a mindset for when the actual destiny of the war effort was unresolved , and an Axis victory was still possible . Keeping that in mind we can forgive the character change that the script forces - but posterity lost a second chance of seeing Cary Grant play a rat . After his quasi-rat wastrel Johnny Aysgard in SUSPICION , Grant made the film TALK OF THE TOWN with Ronald Colman and Jean Arthur . His character of Leopold Dilg is suspected of arson / possibly felony murder , but we realize that he is being railroaded by Charles Dingle on those charges . A few years passed and in 1943 Grant agreed to play Joe Adams , gambler and con man , who decides to get involved in the charity racket to make a real killing . And I am sure that Grant chose the part because Joe was a rat - as bad and violent in his way as Johnny was in his . We see this in Joe early on - he has to raise some capital for his scheme , and goes to collect the money that is owed to him . As always Grant is dapper and soft spoken , but here he demonstrates what is underneath all this : his Joe gets the money by beating up the man who owes it . To make the scene more effective , we never see Grant beat the man , but the scene is shot from the legs down , where the man is whimpering on the ground and willing to give up the money . It was a unique moment in the film , only duplicated towards the end when Grant kicks his partner in the face in a final confrontation about the swindle . That is shown performed by Grant - far more visibly than the first scene . Yet the effect of this violence is shattered by changes in the screenplay . Grant's Joe meets the capable and suspicious Dorothy Briant ( Laraine Day ) at the organization that is creating the charity . She is antagonistic to him at the start , but subsequently they fall in love . At the same time one of her assistant / friends is " Swede " ( Charles Bickford ) , and he starts working on Joe's conscience regarding the war effort and the need of the money for the purposes it is supposed to push . So when Grant beats up his partner he is actually doing it to prevent their plans for the theft of the charity money to come to fruition . Again the studio ( RKO again ) and the actor's agent refused to countenance a negative image for Grant . So we have to be satisfied with two scenes where Grant uses his muscles to beat people up . One should be thankful for small favors - Grant would try again in 1944 when he appeared in NONE BUT THE LONELY HEART to play a criminal type , but there too the screenplay would prevent him from playing a total rat again .
Paging Thornton Wilder	My memories of this production are over twenty years old now - it was pushed by PBS because it seemed a good production and the play by Johann Nestoy ( 19th Century Austria's greatest dramatist ) was the ancestor of Thornton Wilder's THE MERCHANT OF YONKERS turned into THE MATCHMAKER turned into HELLO , DOLLY ! It was a good production , particularly Felicity Kendall's " pants " role of the larking junior clerk Christopher ( her scene ordering food at the restaurant as though she were to the manor born was wonderful ) , but one performance was totally annoying . Dimsdale Laden's Zangler ( the model for Wilder's Vandergelder ) was annoying . Either the performer ( or in this case , the director ) made the character so fatuous that one could not believe he had a head for business . Both Paul Ford and Walter Matthau in their respective performances as Vandergelder showed business competence as well as self-importance . They were believable , while Laden was improbable . From the start of his first line he seemed to contradict every sentence he said by repeating it from the center or going around to a different point of view immediately . And doing it with the most vacant faced grinning smile I have ever seen in a performance . Only once did that smile end , and the face seem ( momentarily ) funny and human - when he is presented with the bill for all the characters at the restaurant , he suddenly got bugged-eyed and upset ( and , best of all , at a loss for words ) . Too bad that approach could not be used more frequently in his case . He drags this play production down from a possible 8 or 9 to a 6 .
A Mighty Thud - Paging Burt Lancaster and Beau Bridges	Warner Beery made one really good film biography in his career : VIVA VILLA . If it did not catch the truth of the story of Francisco Pancho " Villa , it came close to giving a fascinating view of the personality that to many Americans remains ( with his associate Zapata ) the key figure of the Mexican Revolution of 1910 - 1921 . But it was not his only biographical film . The film that followed VIVA VILLA was THE MIGHTY BARNUM , which emphasized Beery's comic abilities . It was not as good a movie . Beery was at the height of his Hollywood stardom ( he was not the regular comic lug yet , except in some of the films with Marie Dresser ) . In 1930 he did arguably his best film performance as Butch , the gangster in THE BIG HOUSE who keeps pining over his unseen girlfriend . In 1931 he shared ( with Fredric March ) the best actor Oscar for his performance in THE CHAMP . In 1933 he would be Dan Packer , the wealthy scoundrel with political ambitions and a troublesome toy wife ( Jean Harlow ) in DINNER AT EIGHT . In 1934 , besides VIVA VILLA he did his best co-starring film with Jackie Cooper , TREASURE ISLAND . And in 1935 he and Harlow were reunited with Clark Gable and Rosalind Russell in CHINA SEAS . Artistically Beery was at his peak . THE MIGHTY BARNUM demonstrates that a great performer or star does not have to be in a slump to make a turkey , but can make one in the midst of a trove of great performances . It is not that Beery does not try to give a good performance as the great 19th Century impresario , museum owner , super humbug ( but lovable one ) , and circus magnate . It is just that he's saddled with such a weak script that he does not know what to make of his role . Occasionally he seems a visionary about the entertainment world ( which old P . T . really was - he thoroughly understood glitz and advertising was a key to success , long before his rivals did ) . But Barnum was ( on the whole ) a shrewd , skillful businessman . He was tricked badly once in a swindle involving a clock company that was failing - it led to his temporary bankruptcy . But most of the time he and his shows ( and his skillful , entertaining tricks ) made a great deal of money . Beery's Barnum will push certain people or exhibits for what they are worth , but he keeps coming a-cropper regarding properly developing them . The script writers were doing this on purpose . They wanted to spring a last minute surprise on the audience concerning Barnum's friend and adviser , Mr . Walsh ( Adolphe Menjou ) . Menjou always suggests the smart thing to do to push the various acts Barnum controls , and Barnum's weakest point is when Mr . Walsh and he quarrel for a few years . Only at the tail end , when they have made their apologies , and Barnum offers Walsh a partnership , does he learn that his friend's first name is " Bailey " . This is as bad a conclusion as that of Don Ameche's biography about Stephen Foster . As has been mentioned in the other review of this film here , Barnum's brilliant business partner was James Bailey . Show Walsh to the " Egress " . The other roles include various Barnum celebrities and fakes : Joyce Heth , the Feejee ( " Fiji " ) Mermaid , the Cardiff Giant , General Tom Thumb , Jumbo , and , of course , Virginia Bruce as Jenny Lind . The fact that Barnum actually improved the entertainment of the masses in America is not commented on ( his Museums had lectures in them , and he tried to stress some educational features in his menageries and circuses dealing with animals ) . His love of fooling the public ( which laughed at his fooling ) is emphasized . It's an entertaining enough movie , but try to catch the television films starring Burt Lancaster or Beau Bridges to get a closer look at the real man Phineas Taylor Barnum , one time member of the Connecticut Legislature ( and nearly Governor of Connecticut ) , and one of the 19th Century's most colorful and memorable figures . And , if you have a chance , go to Bridgeport and see his home , which is a famous circus museum now - fittingly enough .
Medicine and epidemics in the Early U . S . Republic	If the average American is asked about science in 18th and early 19th Century America , they will point to Benjamin Franklin who certainly was Mr . Scientist in his day . Dr . Franklin virtually created the study of electricity as we know it , and was recognized by his doctorate and membership in the Royal Society . But he was not the only scientist in our country . Among the Tory - Loyalists in the Revolution was Benjamin Thompson , who left the U . S . and settled in London , but later went to Bavaria and became chief adviser to the king of that country . He was made Count Rumford , and as such invented ( like Franklin ) a stove which proved Rumford's studies on heat ( in their way as important as Franklin's work on electricity ) . And there were others . Dr . Alexander Garden , a noted Carolinian based botanist , found a flower that was named for him to this day : the " Gardenia " . Besides Franklin and Thompson / Rumford others became members of the Royal Society even before Franklin did . One , surprising to us , was the Rev . Dr . Cotton Mather . Mather was fascinated in all types of native America phenomenon and wrote to the Royal Society about this - and was recognized for his activities . I think we think it odd because of Mather's fanaticism about Puritanism and also about witchcraft . We forget that Mather disapproved of the evidence used in the Salem Trials ( he had his suspicion of " spectral " evidence through " eye-witnesses " like teenage girls and servants ) . We also forget his most magnificent moment - one never taken up in any movie or television retelling . In the 1710s and 1720s Mather ( who had been reading of some experiments ) tried to get a crude inoculation system set up in Boston to fight smallpox epidemics . It was a brave fight , but in the end ( when he died in 1728 ) Mather had to admit he failed . Early America had to combat the same diseases ( smallpox , yellow fever , cholera ) that attacked other large urban centers in the Western Hemisphere , as well as the centers in Europe and Asia . The worst epidemics were the smallpox and yellow fever attacks . In 1793 and 1794 the U . S . Government had to abandon the national capital ( then in Philadelphia ) and move south for several months while yellow fever killed off hundreds of people in that city . But by the 1790s there was one major difference . The studies in inoculation that fascinated Mather earlier in the century were gathered and developed by Dr . Edward Jenner into the " cowpox " vaccine to fight small pox . Unlike yellow fever ( which would not be cured until 1902 ) it was now possible to reduce the horror of smallpox . But this did not take into account superstition and provincialism . The medical profession did not accept Jenner in the U . S . They felt it made no sense to inflict one illness ( cowpox ) in place of another . They did not realize that Jenner was sure that the momentary infliction of a lesser disease might prevent the greater one . One of the few men in America who did realize this was so was the third U . S . President , Thomas Jefferson . Jefferson was a scientist too , and was aware of the developments of English and European medicine . One of the few doctors willing to try to use inoculation was Boston based physician , Dr . Benjamin Waterhouse . This episode , set about 1806 , is how Waterhouse is trying to convince the medical fraternity that it is time to accept what Jenner found ( and what Mather predicted ) as fact : Innoculate with cowpox , and you prevent people from getting smallpox . But he is fighting more than conservative fellow doctors . The public is not fond of the idea , and soon Waterhouse is facing mob violence . But he is determined to prove his case - and suddenly finds Jefferson willing to help him . Bob Cummings played Waterhouse , and his determination is met with his nervous reactions to the mobs and opposition . The concluding scene was with John Dehner , in a rare role as a good guy - President Jefferson here . Alone in the 1806 White House ( pre - War of 1812 fire damaged ) , Jefferson is going to be inoculated . And then Waterhouse finds out a secret the President has kept from him , but the only way to sell the public on the use of inoculation . I will not mention what it is , but it is a surprise .
One bad tempered gorilla	This has it's moments as an early Pre-code Betty Boop . On Halloween a scarecrow finds a printed invitation to Betty's house for a party . He shows up , and after warming himself he assists her in setting up her home . Like most of the plots of Fleischer's cartoons , the initial structure is jettisoned for new incidents and characters to take over . The last we see of the Scarecrow is his putting up wall pictures of witches and black cats from special paint cans labeled " witch paint " and " cat paint " . He flicks these on the walls , and the witches appear on brooms while the cats appear with their backs humped up . Betty is shown coring pumpkins ( actually a cat descends with a device to do the coring , but Betty acts tired after each one is cored ) . Soon the guests arrive , and we see them bobbing for apples - one gets knocked out by an apple he is supposed to catch with his teeth . Then , about two thirds of the way through the cartoon , we see a gorilla arrive . YOU TUBE suggests that this particular cartoon was taken off the television shows of the 1950s and 1960s because it is a racial stereotype ( presumably for African - Americans ) , but it does need stretching to see that . The idea of a gorilla as a symbol for a Black male is an old one , but this gorilla has nothing suggestive of what racial stereotyping would suggest . It just is a bullying gorilla , who first hits a tree ( hurting a behind that suddenly appears ) , and blackening the eyes of a inoffensive owl . He then sees the party , and appropriates all the apples in a bobbing for apples . But soon he is being pursued by goblins and witches , apparently directed at him by a mysterious big cat . He is eventually chased out of the party , to the happiness of the other guests . But was that supposed to suggest the stereotypical superstition associated with male African-Americans too ? I still find it quite a stretch . It is not a bad cartoon , but not one of the best efforts by Fleischer's studio .
Mr . Gillie and his employer .	This film is the comic version of " The Bodysnatcher " or " Mania " . It's Burke and Hare with a sense of humor . Vincent Price actually made quite a number of film comedies , such as " Champagne for Caesar " . He is actually quite good in using his normal menace and meanness for comic affect . He is Mr . Trumbull , the junior partner ( but actually the active partner ) of a decaying firm of undertakers . Trumbull has no single redeemable characteristic - he's bossy to his father-in-law partner ( Karloff ) , he's bossy to his wife , he mistreats and bullies Lorre ( his employee ) , and he kills his subjects . Still some of his problems are sympathetic ones - his wife Amarylis sings at the funerals ( listen to her warble " He is but sleeping " at Rathbone's funeral service - Price looks beatific as she sings , and when asked why he explains he hopes her vocal chords will snap ) . The number of good one liners in this film ( spread among the leads ) is nice . Karloff being unable to deliver a coherent funeral address , because he can't recall who is being buried . Rathbone dying , again and again , reciting Macbeth . Joe E . Brown wishing the corpses in his cemetery a pleasant night's sleep . And Lorre constantly making comments regarding his unpleasant boss . One of the best is when , at Rathbone's funeral , Price is enjoying the sight of the large amount of money he's being paid for the funeral of Rathbone ( whom he hated as a tightwad and landlord ) . Lorre , noting the arrival of most of the mourners , goes inside to tell Price , who basically tells him they can just wait . Lorre turns around and leaves , stating quite audibly , " Ungrateful employer . " The line is delivered like it comes from some left wing play of the turn of the 20th Century . It is a funny little movie , and well worth watching .
Whatever happened to those great criminals and thugs of the 1920s ?	I like I WALK ALONE . It is an interesting example of film noir , but it also has curious slants of it's own . It is also one of the first pairings of Kirk Douglas and Burt Lancaster in film . Douglas and Lancaster were so well balanced in their movies that they were interchangeable . While in most of them they were allies or buddies ( THE DEVIL'S DESCIPLE , GUNFIGHT AT O . K . CORRAL , TOUGH GUYS ) they could alternate as the villain against each other . It's hard to find a pair of actors who did this as well or at all . Matthau and Lemmon usually were in comedies ( although they both could be at loggerheads on some ethical points or past history ) . Grant and Ralph Bellamy are normally love rivals ( Bellamy being hopelessly outclassed ) . Crosby and Fitzgerald are usually in a battle of the generations , and a confrontation of two street smart types . And so it goes in other male pairings . SPOILERS AHEAD : Here , Kirk is the villain - he got away with a large stolen cash prize in a crime back in the 1920s / early 1930s . His partner Burt got caught , and was sent to prison for 14 years ( actually rather lucky for him - a cop was killed ) . Burt is now out of prison , and he discovers that Kirk is quite a social success . He took the money and used it to build a gang , but he was smart enough to use his profits to get a legitimate sheen to his image : he's a successful " nightclub " owner with many wealthy friends and customers . One of the best moments early in the film is when Lancaster sees newspapers and magazines that show Douglas swanning with the swells ( even wearing top hat and overcoat in a rotogravure shot ) . Not quite like the good old Dillinger days , or even Al Capone . Other films had touched upon the " legitimization " of mob money as time passed . In THE ROARING TWENTIES , while Jimmy Cagney is building up his hooch empire he invests the money in a legitimate taxi company ( an early example of money laundering ) , only to lose everything when the stock market crashes . Ironically , his untrustworthy second-in-command ( Humphrey Bogart ) never diversifies but keeps to the illegal activities . He not only survives the crash , but he profits by it ( taking over Cagney's property - though he contemptuously leaves him one taxicab ) . But even he tries to pick up a better public image - you see him practicing his putting in his office at one point . Lancaster confronts Douglas in his nightclub , only to be brought into the modern world of organized crime . All Lancaster really wants is his half of the original money . But as Douglas ' accountant , Wendell Corey , says they can't just give him the cash as it has been invested throughout Douglas's financial empire . Lancaster is left without cash , and led a chase as well by Douglas using Lizbeth Scott as femme fatale bait . He ends up getting beaten ( by Mike Mazurki ) . But he remains determined to beat Douglas and get his share . He does in a manner that today would not pass muster . He entraps Douglas by pretending to have him at the end of a loaded gun , forcing Douglas to make a confession before the police . Douglas , naturally frightened , does admit information that only the criminal involved in the crime would have known , but at the end , he sneers at Lancaster saying that the confession was gotten under duress . But then Lancaster shows his gun was empty . Civil libertarians today would denounce this trick , saying the confession was tainted . In 1948 it was perfectly legal .
Mitchell Leisin's Nightmare Musical	Successful journeyman director with taste , Mitchell Leisin was responsible for many films of distinction like DEATH TAKES A HOLIDAY , KITTY , HOLD BACK THE DAWN , and TO EACH HIS OWN . But he had to do many films that annoyed him for one reason or another . Occasionally a film he put a lot of time and effort into ( LADY IN THE DARK , for example ) was taken out of his hand and re-cut to it's detriment . Sometimes he was given inferior material to work with . He hated the material that became THE BIG BROADCAST OF 1938 . He was highly capable as a musical director . Besides LADY IN THE DARK , he did MURDER AT THE VANITIES ( which introduced COCKTALES FOR TWO ) . But this project was dropped on him because of other projects he wanted to do . The key to understanding this was that it was the last film for Paramount that W . C . Fields was to do . To his fans , Fields was a great comic artist - one of the greatest film personalities of his time if not of all time . But he was , in the words of Leisin , " the most ornery S . O . B . I ever met ! " Fields kept on making demands in the production , such as a share of the writing credits ( so that he could make more money from the studio ) . He also interfered in scenes where he was not wanted . Leisin , a man of culture and taste , put Kirsten Flagstad into the film in a segment . But Fields muscled into a sequence around the pre-filmed segment of Flagstad singing " The Ride of the Valkyrie " from SIEGFRIED , and made a crack that he thought it was a squawking animal . Leisin hated this , and subsequently announced in Fields ' hearing that Miss Flagstad's agent was planning to sue the studio if the line was kept in . Fields raised no objection to the line being taken out . It's an odd musical . Like all the BIG BROADCAST movies it centers on radio and the personalities on it . But here we have the Gigantic - Colossal ocean liner race across the Atlantic , with Leif Ericson's revolutionary turbine engine that works on radio waves . It's doubtful that something like this would work , but the audience was there to be entertained . T . Frothingham Bellows ( Fields in his first role ) is sending his brother ( S . B . Bellows ) to board the Colossal ( the reason is that S . B . is a jinx - he has been in every major ship disaster since the sinking of the Merrimac ) . But S . B . ends up on the Gigantic , and does a great deal of damage before he realizes his error . To add to his bad effect , his daughter Martha ( Martha Raye ) is rescued with her boyfriend Scoop ( Lynn Overmann ) . Martha is a jinx too ( she crashed a plane into a mirror factory seven years before ) . ( This is not , as I thought , a reference to the scuttling of the Confederate ironclad Virginia ( i . e . the Merrimac ) in May 1862 . Bellows would be too young for that . It is a reference to the scuttling of the collier U . S . S . Merrimac by Lt . Richmond Hobson and his crew in June 1898 in Santiago Harbor , in a doomed attempt to bottle up Admiral Cevera's Spanish fleet in the Spanish American War . Hobson won the congressional medal of honor for the action . As that was forty years before the movie , S . B . could have been on the scene . ) The entertainment on the ship is handled by the much married Buzz Fielding ( Bob Hope ) and his assistant ( Ben Blue ) . Hope was married to three women , all of whom are on board to make sure he continues paying alimony . His recent fiancé is Dorothy ( Dorothy Lamour ) , but she gradually becomes closer to Leif Erickson . However , Hope slowly becomes closer to his first wife , Cleo ( Shirley Ross ) . The film's one classic moment was their singing " Thanks For The Memories " . Hope , in later years , criticized his singing of the song - it's done very wistfully and sadly , as it should be . He should not have been so harsh , as it became his theme song ( not to mention the Oscar winning song of the year ) . As a pleasant time killer THE BIG BROADCAST OF 1938 is okay . It is not a film for the ages - and Mitchell Leisin would have agreed to that judgment . After it was completed he suffered his first heart attack , due to the strain of working with Fields . He never worked with Fields again . Fortunately he went on to better films . For Leisin's sake ( and in honor of his health hazard ) I'll give it a " 7 " .
An Explosion ( West of Java ) To Remember ?	I really liked this series , but I had a little trouble with this episode - well acted and with some point that it merits a " 7 " , but which I have never seen any verification about . Supposedly , on the morning of August 25 , 1883 , a newspaper reporter in Boston named Henry Soames , when preparing to go to work , suddenly had a violent fit that threw him down , several times . When he came to , he realized that halfway around the world there was a dreadful catastrophe : the eruption of a volcano that would blow an island in half - an island named " Krackatoa " . But it was in the Dutch East Indies ( now Indonesia ) and far away - too far from any telegraph lines . Soames rushes to his paper and prints the story , scooping the entire globe . But the nearest news centers in the far east had not heard anything . Although the newspaper editor ( more about him later ) is at first ecstatic about the scoop , when no confirmation comes out he turns ugly and fires Soames . Soames cannot explain why he had his sudden vision or whatever , but goes home jobless . Then , within 24 hours , Soames is dragged back to the newsroom . The confirmation has come out : Krackatoa erupted on the 26th of August , and killed ( with tsunamis similar to the ones that hit the Indian Ocean last year ) 33 , 000 people . The editor is once again all smiles , as he can be congratulated for scooping the entire western world by 24 hours . But how ? Obviously Soames must have some crazy mental power . So the editor tells Soames he will have a special column , with his own by-line ( a real rarity for newsmen in the 1880s ) , and will predict the future for the readers of the newspaper ! Soames , of course , has had it . He has seen this editor blow hot and cold twice in 24 hours , but this really takes the cake . He tells off the editor before walking out that he is fully aware that people want to know the future to plan for an improved future for themselves . That great tycoons , for instance , would love to know when to buy and sell so they don't lose anything . All his power ( if it is a power ) has shown is that the common human race is a bunch of scared rabbits . As far as Soames is concerned he won't be a tin-pot fortune teller reassuring everyone . There is a coda ( which I have never seen mentioned anywhere else ) that years later one of Soames former fellow workers sees him as a copy editor in a small newspaper on September 7 , 1901 . While observing him , he sees Soames stop in a trance , and write something down , and then leave the office . Then a wire comes over the telegraph . Soames has written " President shot in Buffalo " . The telegram announces that McKinley has been shot in Buffalo . I liked the story because the actor who played Soames ( John Meillon ) gave a good effective reading of the best scene in the drama - where Soames tells off the newspaper editor . Parts of the episode were a trifle slow , but that scene made the show worthwhile . We all wish , at time , we knew the future , but knowing the future only shows us what pitiful creatures we are , dependent on various circumstances for our comfort and survival . And Soames ( who doesn't even understand why he had the vision about an island volcano he never heard of ) has only found it makes him a freak , and it buffets him about concerning his job . The on-again / off-again " friendly editor " was played by British actor John Phillips . You have probably saw Phillips in many parts over the years in movies and television ( usually British television , not American ) . Yet he had a good handling of an " American accent " , and in Peter Ustinov's ROMANOFF AND JULIET ( made about the time of this episode ) , Phillips played the American Ambassador to Concordia . With his sharp , pointed nose , Phillips could look smart and formidable and threatening , so he played many villains in his career . On the original FORSYTHE SAGA he was Sir Alexander MacGown , a Tory M . P . who takes the social conflict between his girlfriend Marjorie Farrar and Fleur Forsythe Mont into the House of Commons , attacking Fleur's husband Michael . Phillips was usually a very good character actor , and he makes the most out of the scenes his newspaper editor has in this episode of ONE STEP BEYOND , who is too blind to see how his own behavior helps put a major crimp into the newspaper's scheme to use Soames " correctly " .
" First you question my financial resources , then you ask me business advice "	No it is not the greatest of W . C . Field's comedies - it does not rank with THE BANK DICK or IT'S A GIFT or THE OLD FASHIONED WAY or even MY LITTLE CHICKADEE . But POPPY is of considerable interests to the many fans of the great misanthropic comic . In 1923 he appeared on stage in POPPY as " EUSTACE McGARGLE " . It was the first lead role in a play ( as opposed to one or two comic supporting parts , and his years of vaudeville juggling / comic routines , or his years headlining in the Ziefeld Follies ) that FIelds had . Interestingly enough his performance on stage enabled him to cross paths with another future movie comedian ( though a lesser one in retrospect ) , Robert Woolsey ( of Wheeler and Woolsey ) , who appeared as a rustic victim of McGargle . The play gave Fields a " Fields " day as a carnival swindler , who was also the foster father of a young woman who Fields / McGargle would try to pass off as an heiress . The play was subsequently made into a silent film , " Sally of the Sawdust " ( Field's third silent movie , and first directed by the great D . W . Griffith ) . The silent version was actually a vehicle for Griffith's pitifully inadequate actress find Carol Dempster ( who was also his girlfriend at the time ) . It is also of interest because the boyfriend of Dempster was played by a young Alfred Lunt ( sadly Lynn Fontaine was not in this film ) . The 1925 " Sally of the Sawdust " had some good moments when Fields did his larcenous best - including a " heroic " scene at the end where he explains " Sally " ' s true parentage at court , and saves her from prison . But Dempster's attempts at " gamin " like cuteness are tiresome to a viewing today . Lunt does well , but is a distinctly supporting actor here . Fortunately sound came along , so that Mr . Lunt ( now with Lynn Fontaine ) would make THE GUARDSMAN and plenty of television appearances in the future to demonstrate their fine acting abilities . Ms Dempster , of course , just faded into oblivion . Fields too would benefit by sound , and would leave us that nasal twang that made us guffaw so much . And by doing " Poppy " as a sound film we were able to hear some of the dialog from the stage play that the silent film did not have . Mention has been made of three moments : the sale of the " talking dog " , the business with the hot dog vendor ( which is where the line at the start of this review comes from ) , and the business with the patent medicine purchaser ( " No more " ) . A fourth one is the sequence ( somewhat too brief ) where " Professor " McGargle entertains the guests at a society party with some high sounding concerto on a strange looking stringed instrument . He ends up playing " Pop Goes the Weasel " . At the end , when " Poppy " is revealed to really be the lost heiress , McGargle takes leave of his adopted daughter in a quiet , dignified way - not quite as tragic as a similar sequence in THE OLD FASHIONED WAY , perhaps , but equally not as tragic and total as his leaving her in the radio version of " Poppy " that was made within two years of the film . That version was put out on records about 1970 , and keeps to the story , but seems sadder than this movie or the 1925 silent version .
After the Revolution - it wasn't peaches and cream !	This nice little comedy ( based on a French play that Robert Sherwood rewrote ) deals with a matter that was of interest around the entire world after 1917 - 1921 . What happened to the remnants of the Russian aristocracy left in tatters by the hurricane of the Bolshevik Revolution ? The fact was that for most of them who fled or escaped Russia there was only poverty left to face - the great estates and the jewelry and wealth had been confiscated by the revolutionary government of Lenin and Trotszky . A few had been smart enough to have funds and wealth in lands outside the borders of old Russia , but most never thought of it . Charles Boyer is Prince Mikhail Ouratieff and Claudette Colbert is Grand Duchess Tatiana Romanoff . You have to get that straight first , because although Boyer is a Prince he is not of the royal blood ( as Colbert is - being of the Tsar's family ) . They are married ( and quite loving ) but Colbert is of higher social rank - so in many scenes Boyer is forced to agree to her point of view . However , Boyer has one thing that is more important . As an aide to the Tsar ( one of his duties was to tell Nicholas II what the weather was each day ) he was entrusted before the end of the Empire with over 20 million francs of Romanoff money kept in a French bank . This was a sign of the Tsar's great faith in Boyer's devotion , but it was a mixed blessing . He and Colbert were caught , and she was tortured by a leading Commissar , one Dimitri Gorotchenko ( Basil Rathbone ) . However they managed to escape . Now in Paris some dozen years after fleeing Russia they are living in poverty . All Boyer has is a sword and a flag . But French bankers are aware that he has legal title to use the million of francs in the Romanoff accounts and hope he will . Few have the illusion that the Soviet regime is going to collapse . But , as Boyer keeps insisting , the money is not his to spend - it's the Tsar's . He was entrusted to keep it for the day of return to Holy Russia . As Boyer keeps saying , he won't spend anything : " Not a billion , not a million , not a thousand , not a sou ! " But he and Colbert have to survive . They start looking at the want ads and find a job for a butler and maid at the home of a Mr . and Mrs . Dupont , a wealthy banker and his wife ( Melville Cooper and Isabel Jeans ) . There are also a daughter and son ( Anita Louis and Maurice Murphy ) . Boyer and Colbert figure that their service to the Russian Royal Family in St . Petersburg's Court prepares them for being servants . After an initially bad moment or two ( particularly as the four Duponts are all somewhat selfish and demanding ) , Boyer and Colbert gradually win the family over by their charm , their physical attractions , and their ability to figure out how to satisfy the needs of the employers and to do the various activities in the house . But they also discover the secret of labor unions , and ( horrible though it may seem ) how it may behoove to join one for servants . Then comes the critical point : a large oil deal is being set up by a consortium from Britain , France , and the Netherlands , to develop two Russian oil fields . This is unheard of - and actually Stalin's Russia is not too thrilled about having foreigners control their oil . So they send their best man to deal with this problem and meet Dupont and his associates . You got it - it's Rathbone . TOVARICH has actually not aged too badly , even though the old Soviet Union is a thing of the past too . Boyer and Colbert make a sweet , lovable pair - willing to do anything to be successful as servants . Cooper , Jeans , Louise , and Murphy eventually show more human features , such as Cooper's momentary lapses ( at one point the banker can't recall his own name ) . And Rathbone , although capable of governmental viciousness ( in his off-screen torturing of Colbert ) actually wins our respect in the end - he turns out , like Boyer and Colbert , to be as patriotic as they are . With NINOTCHKA and COMRADE X , TOVARICH makes up a trilogy of film comedies that do paint a picture of the plight of a mighty nation struggling to regain it's feet , in the face of internal disarray and rivalries , and foreign hostility . Certainly a worthy film .
" Oh , was it a small , little snake . . . . Don't worry . Your worries will be over soon "	I have always liked this whimsical black comedy . It does not take itself too seriously ( unlike the 1989 remake with Sean Penn and Robert Di Niro ) . Humphrey Bogart , Peter Ustinov ( with his pet snake ) , and Aldo Ray escape from Devil's Island , and reach port as the first step to permanent freedom . But they need new clothes and money , so they plan to rob and kill the owners of a store ( Leo G . Carroll and Joan Bennett ) , but change their minds because of their kindnesses to them and their attractive daughter ( Gloria Talbot ) . They end up as unpaid clerks in the store . Then alone comes Basil Rathbone ( the actual owner of the store ) and his nephew John Baer ) . Rathbone is at his haughtiest , and Baer is fully supportive of his uncle ( who will one day leave him some money , of course ) . The three convicts do their best to make Rathbone's stay as unpleasant as they can . Ustinov's little pet helps end that visit , and Baer's as well . At the end , they decide to return to Devil's Island , as it is fairly easy for them to get off whenever they could . To me the dialog had some nice bits and pieces in it : Two examples come to mind . When Rathbone is first parading around " his " store in front of Carroll , Bennett , and the convicts , he demands something to eat several times . A fed up Bogart goes into the kitchen and returns with a pineapple . He hands it to Rathbone , who is amazed at getting the unprepared fruit ( it is still intact in it's skin ) . " What am I to do with this ? " , Rathbone demands . " Swallow it ! " , says Bogart . Later , after Baer ( who was searching the clothes of his dead uncle ) gets bitten by Ustinov's snake , he asks them if he should worry . They start chuckling and Bogart repeats the line in the " Summary " line above . It is not the best black comedy film , but it is pretty consistently amusing and worth watching .
To Fool The Axis . . .	This film is an example that occasionally truth can be stranger than fiction . Ewen Montague , an officer in the British military intelligence in World War II , was aware that unless something was done to reduce the defenses that the German and their Italian allies set up in Sicily the Allied assault on the island ( which we would observe close up in the movie PATTON ) would be a bloody fiasco that might set back the Allied war effort in Europe . The key to it would be to convince the Germans that if an attack was being planned it was being planned for another part of the European continent . Montague was sharp enough to formulate a daring scheme - and this film shows that formulation , the care and planning needed to pull it off , and how it succeeded in fooling the Nazis . Montague's scheme is to deposit the corpse of an R . A . F . officer off the coast of Spain , still attached to a briefcase full of " invasion plan " documents - except the plans are not for the area of Italy or Sicily but for France . He reasons that the Fascist Franco regime in Spain will be very willing to allow the Nazis to read the secret papers ( or copies of them ) . The trick is to find a corpse that will look like it died violently in battle and can fool the enemy , and that enough " details " regarding the " dead officer " can be verified by Nazi agents in Britain to make the Germans believe the corpse is genuine and not a plant . So we watch Clifton Webb as Montague ( in a rare straight dramatic part - well acted by the way ) consult with specialists , including Andre Morell as the famous British Home Office pathologist Sir Bernard Spilsbury . A good corpse is selected , and the right amount of proper personal items put into his military tunic and overcoat ( including even a restaurant bill for the previous night before his death ) . When all is ready , the corpse is dumped off the coast of Spain by submarine . And then Montague and British Intelligence sit back and watch what happens , crossing their fingers that the scheme works . Stephen Boyd ( three years from his performance as Messala in BEN HUR ) plays an Irishman who is spying for the Nazis , and who eventually discovers that the " corpse " is the genuine article . The result is that the Nazis weakened their defenses in Sicily sufficiently to allow the Allies to show up and ( despite the Patton-Montgomery rivalry ) retake the island in the first major defeat the Germans had of European conquered territory . A fascinating story well told - and as I said , true despite being so improbable . Sir Bernard's career as the leading British Criminal trial pathologist ( from the Crippen Case in 1910 to the De Antiquis Case in 1947 ) was never given a movie treatment . Occasionally he is mentioned , as in UPSTAIRS , DOWNSTAIRS in one episode when Edward ( Christopher Beeney ) is reading a newspaper in 1925 about the " Crowsborough " Murder - the trial of Norman Thorne - and feels that " Sir Bernard will see it through ! " Actually , that was one of Spilsbury's most controversial cases . He does deserve a Masterpiece Theater series about his life , which ended in 1947 with his tragic suicide .
A Fine Film From A Forgotten Literary Master	JOHNNY COME LATELY is an example of an underrated work that makes a good , atypical film . The Jimmy Cagney that we think of is the anti-hero of THE PUBLIC ENEMY or WHITE HEAT , who we fear but feel sorry for . He also is recalled for his exciting performances in YANKEE DOODLE DANDY and 13 RUE MADELEINE . He was a human dynamo . Watch how he effortlessly goes into the dance and song in FOOTLIGHT PARADE . But here he is a reporter who is tramping around the country ( reading Pickwick Papers ) who gets into trouble in a corrupt town , but is helped by the owner of a newspaper ( Grace George , an old friend of Cagney's , in her only movie role ) . Together they take on the local machine , with assistance from George Cleveland and Marjorie Main among others . That Edward McNamara finally admits defeat is actually due to him not being the real villain in the film ( his police chief , an ex-convict , is the real villain ) . Cagney does have one or two obligatory fight sequences , but he displays a gentleness , especially when dealing with Ms George , that is very unusual and sweet . JOHNNY COME LATELY was a novel by Louis Bromfeld . A few years ago Public Television did an " American Masters " episode on Bromfeld , who was ( at one time in the early 1930s ) considered the equal to Hemingway and Faulkner and Fitzgerald as a novelist . He is best recalled today for the novel , THE RAINS CAME , made into a classic early starring film for Tyrone Power and Myrna Loy . But his best written novel is supposed to be THE FARM , wherein he discussed the day to day running of a farm , and it's importance to the country . Ironically it was the subject of farms and agriculture that ended his brilliant writing career - he spent his savings trying to make a model farm for helping American farmers learn the latest techniques in agriculture . In the end he had to lose his farm as well ( it was a brilliant idea , but he couldn't afford to keep it up ) . Bromfeld's writing can be sampled in JOHNNY COME LATELY , where he concentrates well on the characters in the story . Look at the scene where Cagney goes to a political power who likes ketchup in everything - Cagney plays up to this weakness , with odd but successful results .
A Hint of Georges Guynemer	I always liked the convoluted logic that transcends whatever we are used to in the THE TWILIGHT ZONE . This episode is not one of the best known of the episodes , but it is interesting on several levels . Kenneth Haigh is seen landing a vintage 1917 British plane into an American air base in France in 1959 . His initial comment is delicious : " We never knew you fellows were this advanced ! " Gradually he ( like most of the time travelers in episodes of the ZONE ) realizes that he has been listed as missing in action since 1917 , and that he has somehow transcended time when he entered a cloud bank that observers noticed going into . He can , of course , stay there - although it would take time to get used to the fact that everyone in the world of his day is dead now - but he learns that an old friend ( Alexander Scourby ) is going to be arriving that afternoon at the base . Scourby is now an air force general , but Haigh keeps thinking that something is wrong and that he'll never see Scourby . And sure enough Scourby's plane is reported missing and late . Spoiler coming up : Haigh suddenly remembers that years earlier , on the last day he was in 1917 , he saw Scourby ( a fellow pilot ) having problems with his craft being chased by a German plane . Haigh panicked and did not come to Scourby's assistance . Now he wonders if his act of cowardice is going to result in the death of the man - somewhat belatedly . So he takes off on his plane and reenters the same cloud bank . Soon afterward Scourby shows up finally . When he is asked about Haigh , he recalls the last day Haigh and he fought side by side . Haigh seemed to run away into a cloud bank for the longest period , but suddenly he returned and came to Scourby's assistance , and Scourby survived but Haigh did not . Most of the story is an interesting switch on the typical time travel story , wherein someone goes back in time to stop an event ( in one of the ZONE tales Russell Johnson tries to return to Ford's Theater to stop Lincoln's Assassination ) . But usually we learn that history can't be changed ( or if it changed the results are incalculably difficult to foresee ) . Here the act in the past already occurred , and a belated disaster may be about to occur . The time traveler has to return to his own period to save the actual course of history . An interesting switch . I wonder if the germ of the story here , about Haigh's disappearance into the clouds , may have been based on the fate of French war ace , Georges Guynemer . The leading French Ace up to 1917 , Guynemer disappeared in 1917 when he went on patrol , and was last seen entering a set of clouds . Although German records later said his plane and body were found and he was buried , the French did not hear of this at the time . Instead French children were told that Guynemer flew so high the angels would not let him return to earth , or he could not come back . Somehow , I would not be surprised that the end of the ace had some influence in the construction of the story .
Night and the CIty	CITY THAT NEVER SLEEPS tries hard to be a major film noir , and does not quite make it . If THE RACKET had a promising central figure at sixes and sevens with the legal and illegal authorities , but no character development to explain how he got the way he did , CITY tries to be a film noir variant of those films like IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE or AN INSPECTOR CALLS where characters are not quite human , and are intermingling ( and bedeviling ) humans and their motivations . We are watching Gig Young , a career cop from a family of cops , who is slowly being corrupted by crooked big - time lawyer Edward Arnold . Young is basically acting like a go-between between Arnold and the police , tipping the lawyer off about current investigations . He does get well paid for this , but he has to deal with Arnold's right hand man William Talman , who is not to be trusted . Young does not like Talman's cultivating Young's younger brother - possibly turning him into a complete criminal . He does not realize that Talman is also working in cahoots with Arnold's trophy wife ( Marie Windsor ) to get the upper hand over the lawyer . Young's own behavior is not really liked by his father , an honest old style cop who is regarded as a hero by the department . You can see that the situation is going to lead to disaster . Young is working an evening shift , and his partner is unable to show up . An unknown Police Sergeant ( Chill Wills ) takes the partner's place , and the two go around the night world of the city . And while they do so , both are unaware of the explosions about to rend apart the worlds of Arnold , Windsor , and Talman - and dragging in Young's younger brother . Some things to watch in the film : Talman ( having shot someone ) is aware that the only " witness " is a figure in a window . Is it a mechanical man or a real witness ? Talman has to spend hours watching , and to see if the figure remains " mechanical " or not . See also the sequence where Young chases Talman along a deserted set of elevated train tracks through Chicago . It is a tense and exciting sequence . Finally , note the appearance ( in his first movie role according to this board ) of comedian Tom Poston as a police officer , who gets involved in a situation that is far from amusing . It's an odd first role for such a funny figure to have played at all .
Shown completely on YOU TUBE .	Aside from a curious double edged piece of racism , this " Silly Symphony " Cartoon is pegged on the film stars of the 1930s . I suspect more people than we can think of actually can remember most of these stars . They include , Katherine Hepburn ( as " Little Bo Peep " - rallee she is ) ; Charles Laughton , Spencer Tracy , and Freddie Bartholemew as the Three Men in a boat ( Laughton is Captain Bligh , Tracy is Manuel from CAPTAIN'S COURAGEOUS , and Freddie is David Copperfield ) ; Hugh Herbert as Old King Cole , Ned Sparks as his " merry " Jester , Groucho , Chico , and Harpo Marx as his fiddler three , Joe ( UGH ! ! ) Penner as the servant bringing him a bowl ( actually a kettle ) and asking if he wants a " Duck " ( Donald Duck ) ; Stan Laurel as Simple Simon and Oliver Hardy as the pie-man ; Eddie Cantor as Little Jack Horner , and his four and twenty blackbirds include Cab Calloway , Fats Waller , and Lincoln Perry ( Stepin ' Fetchit ) ; Wallace Beery as Little Boy Blue ; Greta Garbo as Marjorie Daw , taught a lesson by Edward G . Robinson ; and at the conclusion they have Fred Astaire ( unfortunately dancing alone ) , Zazu Pitts , Edna Mae Oliver and Mae West playing horns ( Oliver Hardy and Stan Laurel and the Marx Brothers also return playing instruments , and we see George Arliss playing a saxophone and Clark Gable on another instrument ) , and Martha Raye and Joe E . Brown dancing and kissing . Most of these figures are still pretty easy to remember ( Penner and Arliss I think are the most obscure - the former quite understandably ) . The reason is the films of most of these people ( or the recordings of Calloway and Waller ) are accessible by DVD or video . The interesting thing is how the Disney people were watching the movies of the day or the culture . As pointed out in another review of this cartoon only three Marx Brothers pop up - Zeppo had left the act in 1933 . W . C . Fields is Humpty Dumpty , and he is pestered by Charlie McCarthy ( this was the same year as their film together , YOU CAN'T CHEAT AN HONEST MAN ) . When they do the three men in a tub , Laughton is Bligh , Tracy is Manuel , and Bartholemew is young David Copperfield ( oddly enough , not Harvey Cheyne - the role he played opposite Tracy's Manuel in CAPTAIN'S COURAGEOUS ) . Garbo had said " I want to be alone " in GRAND HOTEL in 1933 , but the line was still her best known one - it would be spoofed by Sig Ruman in NINOTCHKA , opposite Garbo . The Laurel and Hardy jokes show careful study of how Stan always does something that Ollie can't and when Ollie figures he can do it he comes a cropper . But Ollie later changes the range of Stan's clarinet playing from tenor to base by hitting Stan on the head with a mallet . That is similar to a joke done by Ollie to a singing Stan in WAY OUT WEST in 1937 . Oddly enough Raye and Brown would be in a comedy together ( ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS A TOUCHDOWN ) in 1939 , so possibly rumors about such a teaming were in the air . Somebody was doing his homework here . The racist jokes dealing with the four and twenty " blackbirds " is as I said a two - edged sword . On the one hand the caricatures are definitely racist , in particular Perry . But the fact that all three were included strikes me as showing they are considered celebrities . Why have them otherwise if they weren't be recognized by the audience watching the cartoon ( the Fleischer cartoons at Paramount frequently used Cab Callaway too ) . The only inexcusable racist joke ( aside from exaggerating Perry's shtick ) was that a blackberry pie hits Hepburn in the face , turning her into an African-American " Bo - Peep " for a moment , and she starts talking with a southern drawl . Hepburn knew of the cartoon - she mentioned it on a program she did in the 1990s about her life for PBS , and said the cartoon's sequence of her " Bo - Peep " riding an outboard motor passed the three men in the tub , was the first time on screen her persona and Tracy's shared a scene or sequence . Odd to think it happened here .
Trading Timothy For Kevin	Meg Ryan , until fairly recently , had a lock on the role of adorable , " gamin " urban types , be they opposite Billy Crystal or Tom Hanks ( except in JOE VS THE VOLCANO ) . Here she played the part opposite Kevin Kline , who demonstrated his acting abilities by doing a " French accent " in his character of " Luc " . The results worked well again if not ( perhaps ) as well as in WHEN HARRY MET SALLY or YOU'VE GOT MAIL or SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE . The interesting part of this film is a drop in chemistry - which works for the film but also works against it . I'll get into this in a moment . The plot is simple : Ryan has been living in Canada with her boy-friend / fiancé Timothy Hutton . But Hutton meets Susan Anbeh , a French woman , and finds his hormones rushing . Hutton leaves Ryan and takes off with Anbeh . Furious , Ryan decides to follow and confront them . But she really is more angry than organized , and she does not quite know what she is doing . On the plane trip she meets Kline , a Frenchmen with itineraries of his own . He has a piece of hot jewelry that he is willing to sell abroad for a tidy sum which he needs to create his own dream . It seems he wants to own a vineyard and develop his own brands of wine . Ryan is slowly tied into his plans and life ( she learns why his family despises him ) , and he in turn helps her with confronting Hutton and Anbeh . The latter plot is to make the Hutton - Anbeh alliance shakier than it is : to convince both partners that they can do better . Kline trains Ryan in developing a personality that can lure back Hutton by showing a slight coldness to him ( an " unapprochacility " ) , while Kline dines with Anbeh , and reminds her of what she is giving up in native born Frenchmen by accepting the " puppy dog " like Hutton . For the purposes of the plot the scheme does work a bit , though it really does not destroy the Hutton - Anbeh alliance . Hutton is tempted by Ryan , but she suddenly pulls the rug from under him , making him see his own immaturity . The odd thing is this is a weakness as well as a strength . Hutton does his role well as a fellow who lets his penis dictate , but he just lacks the chemistry on screen one sees between Ryan and Kline . One can't understand why Ryan's character put up with this weak sister for so long ( even though she is willing to - as she puts it - put down roots in a home life with a man she loves ) . It is the one weakness in the film , and prevents me from giving it more than an " 8 " . The film has some nice parts - Ryan for instance discovering how she loves French cheese too much ( as she finds to her cost ) . Kline certainly manages to fit American popular views of French males : self - satisfied and strong viewed . Also to note is Jean Reno as a wise French police inspector who helps Ryan ( in the end ) to get the jewelry back to it's owners , and make Kline think he got paid for the stolen jewelry . On the whole it is a good little comedy worth watching .
Blake and Peter do one together without Insp . Jacques	It is a little uneven , but if you stick to it you end up liking this warm and fuzzy little film , the only Blake Edwards and Peter Sellers comedy without Chief Inspector Jacques Clousseau . Sellers had played an Indian before . In THE MILLIONAIRESS ( 1960 ) he was an Indian doctor working for the poor in London who attracts the world's richest woman ( Sophia Loren ) . That film has it's moments ( when the original George Bernard Shaw play creeps out ) but this improvised film of 1968 is far better . Sellers is an Indian film actor who somehow was signed up to do a lead part in a Hollywood production called SON OF GUNGA DIN . Sellers ' actor is playing this supposed fictional character ( really fictional , as Kipling never wrote about his brave water carrier having a family ) . In the opening fifteen minutes Sellers demonstrates the wisdom of being hired by refusing to die properly ( or is he trying to stretch out his deathbed sequence for the screen ? ) . He is shot ( while badly wounded ) blowing a bugle call to the British troops about to be entrapped by the Indian " rebels " . Instead of falling down dead he keeps beeping his bugle again and again and again until the director tells him to stop it . Later he ruins a shot where he kills an enemy picket by forgetting that the movie is set in 1878 , and Sellers is still wearing his waterproof wristwatch ! Finally ( I think Stan Laurel would have appreciated this ) he ruins the one-chance-only destruction of the fort by explosives simply by tying his shoe on the plunger . Fired after the last ( he asks the director if he can still do television ) , Sellers should be seen no more . But the director and the film producer ( Gavin McLeod - later of MCHALE'S NAVY , THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW , and THE LOVE BOAT ) call the studio President , Mr . Clutterbuck ( J . Edward McKinley ) and tell him about what has just happened to send the film's budget into the stratosphere . McKinley says he'll see the actor never works in the film industry again , and writes the name ( Hrundi V . Bakshi ) on a paper on his desk . Unfortunately , he did not realize it is a list of his guests for a fancy dinner party the next day . So Clutterbuck's secretary sends Bakshi / Sellers ) an invitation ) . What follows is a disaster upon disaster improv . Unlike THE PINK PANTHER and A SHOT IN THE DARK , Edwards and Sellers approached THE PARTY as an experiment where they were creating escalating disasters at the dinner party that engulf all the guests . The escalating disasters is par and parcel for the work of Edwards ' favorite comedians , Laurel & Hardy , for whom his slapstick comedy THE GREAT RACE ( 1965 ) was dedicated to . Sellers arrives at the party and quickly demonstrates the wisdom of inviting him . His shoe is muddy so he tries to " nonchallantly " clean it off in a pool ( the clean water rapidly turns black ) but the shoe floats away . Later , due to Sellers ' ineptitude the shoe ends up on a tray of canapés being served . Still later , when he hurts his hand Sellers sticks it into a mound of ice on a table , only to find the caterer put beluga caviar within the " mountain " of ice . His real problem is he is a square peg in a round hole . He can't mingle and join the people at the party , many of whom have hostility towards him ( Marge Champion , not dancing in this film , is the stiff wife of a Congressman who just never cottons to Sellers ) . He tries to laugh at jokes , not hearing them completely but laughing anyway , or laughing at anecdotes that aren't funny . In his curiosity he experiments with the pushbuttons of the living room , causing all kinds of odd , disruptive errors to occur . He even ends up feeding " Birdy num nums " to the host's pet parrot . Only one person is actually friendly to him at the start - a western film star , whom Sellers enjoys watching . They get on pretty well , except for one mishap with a toy dart gun ( though Sellers isn't blamed for it ) . Then McLeod shows up with his latest protégé , Michelle Monet ( Claudine Longet ) and a second person turns out to be out-of-place at the party , only a French lady , not an Indian man . In the meantime the problems multiply during dinner , when besides Sellers the host and guests have to deal with a drunken waiter ( Steve Franken - best recalled as Dobie Gillis ' rich rival Chatsworth Osborne Jr . ) . The dinner reduced to a shambles between Sellers and Franken ( including causing a squab to get twisted into a guests wig - don't ask ) , the guests do the best they can . I can't get into all the sequences - that spoils the fun here . One of the best deals with Sellers desperately trying to find a place to pee , and finding the bathrooms in use ( once by Mrs . Champion ) , and finally using one in the master bedroom , that he causes a flood in , and even causes the band drummer to lose his drum ( don't ask ) . However , one sequence actually shows that for all the confusion and destruction he causes , Sellers is actually pretty level headed . He confronts McLeod on the latter's miserable treatment of Longet , and shows up the former as a total creep . One recalls that with the other Edwards-Sellers stumble-bum , Clousseau , he is a walking disaster maker - but he is a first rate detective for all that . As I said , it is a little slow at points , and disjointed at times , but stick to THE PARTY . It is a worthy film for it's star and for it's cast .
When George Stevens was not directing Stan and Ollie	Although slow at spots , this entry in " The Boy Friends " Series of Hal Roach shorts is quite good . It was one of several shown this morning on the Turner Classic Network as examples of shorts directed by George Stevens , George Marshall , and others , many for Roach's studios . I suppose that few of the comedy shorts ( and hundreds were turned out in the 1920s - 1950s ) survive in our memory because of Laurel & Hardy , Edgar Kennedy , Our Gang , the Three Stooges , W . C . Fields , Chaplin , Keaton , Lloyd , Langdon , Robert Benchley , and ( maybe ) Leon Erroll dominating the field . Certainly these comics are the ones we recall in short comedies . One can also add Pete Smith's Specialties and the " Behind the Eighth Ball " Series in the 1940s . But the films with Grady Sutton ( such as this series - he was " Alabam ' " ) are not recalled , nor are those with Burns and Allen , Clark & McCullough , or Thelma Todd and Zasu Pitts or Patsy Kelly . Yet they frequently are as good as the better remembered comedians I listed before . . . possibly sometimes superior ( here I'm thinking of Leon Erroll , whom I have never totally liked ) . In this comedy , Mickey Daniels is the rather overly enthusiastic , if clumsy , boyfriend of Mary Kornman . He lives across the street from her as does his friends Sutton and David Sharpe . Kornman lives with her friend Gertrude Messinger . They have a pet cat , and at the start of the film the cat causes a pet dog belonging to Sharpe to chase it . This leads our trio of half-witted goof heroes to spot an apparent hold-up , and drive onto a sidewalk to break up the hold up and bring the two gunman to the local precinct house ( where Harry Bernard - Mickey's dad - is Captain ) . Bernard lectures his son about taking the law into his hands , and not letting the police handle such dangerous matters . But he is secretly delighted to see his son's bravery , until he finds out that Mickey , Grady , and Dave broke up two of Bernard's best officers from completing the arrest of two other dangerous criminals . He kicks Mickey out of the Precinct . That night Mary and Gert hear noises in their house ( actually their pet cat ) and feel there is a burglar downstairs . Mickey is called over as are his two chums , but no attempt is made to coordinate the three of them , and the results are that in the dark house each of the three thinks the other two are burglars . This results in numerously well timed prat falls , conks on the head with flower pots , and other objects including one priceless moment when Sutton is hitting one " burglar " under a rug who rises whenever he yells for Dave , and hitting another " burglar " wearing a moose's head when he yells for Mickey ! The arrival of most of the precinct's police staff , complete with Bernard , does not help matters . The final moment , when the police reveal themselves , may have influenced a similar type of joke a few years later in one of the Three Stooges ' shorts . The strengths of the series are in the obvious friendly feelings of the three male and two female friends in the tales , and the sense of reality in the settings . Stevens use of well timed damage and mayhem is part of his long work with Stan and Ollie . But Stan and Ollie ( and Edgar , and the other leading comedians in the shorts that are remembered ) had actual personalities that we noted and approved of knowing more and more about - so their series lasted and lasted . Aside from some minor characteristics ( the girls are naive and dumb at times , and Sutton can scare himself very easily - we see him reading a scary book at one point - and Mickey is too swift to jump to conclusions ) there is not really enough to build up a desire for closer study and review . Put another way , it is hard to think of a " Sons of the Desert " club being formed for The Boy Friends . The short , and others in the series , was fun to watch once . I would not make a habit of it .
Rivalries in a Communist " Utopia "	Ernst Lubtisch's classic comic statement about Communist Russia , NINOTCHKA , came out in 1939 . Whether it " influenced " the production ( also by MGM ) of COMRADE X or not I could not say . Certainly there are similarities between the comedies . Lubitsch set his comedy in Paris , where a Communist trade mission is living it up , being corrupted by an émigré Russian noble ( Melvin Douglas ) so he can try to retrieve jewelry that the trade mission is using as collateral . The Russian government does not trust the three men sent , so they send a fiercer ideologue ( Greta Garbo in the title role ) who starts straightening out the mission , until she falls for Douglas's charm . In the end she is lured back ( with her three associates ) to the west and away from the Soviet paradise . NINOTCHKA had Felix Bressart and Sig Ruman in the cast as two of the members of the trade mission . Comments on this thread point out that in the 1930s " accents " were fairly interchangeable in Hollywood , so that the Swedish Garbo ( and later the Austrian Lamarr ) became Russian . So did German Ruman and German - Jewish Bressart ( who would also play a Hungarian in THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER ) . Unlike NINOTCHKA , COMRADE X is set inside that nightmare land , Stalinist Russia . Somebody is sending out unofficial ( but thoroughly correct ) news stories showing the crimes being committed in Russian by the government against the people ( i . e . the purges ) , as well as the idiotic projects and waste mismanagement illustrative of how poorly the government is as effective government . This is being resented by the Presidium , who is represented by Oscar Homlolka ( Commissar Vasiliev ) . Please note that Homolka's make-up makes him look a tremendous bit like one Joseph Stalin . At a public funeral covered by the press court , someone tries to shoot Vasiliev ( who does all he can to hide the assassination plot ) . Mac Thompson ( Clark Gable ) , the American reporter , manages to snap a photo of an odd site - a bearded man who a moment before the shooting opened up the lid of the coffin and popped out . This bearded gentlemen turns out to be one Michael Bastakoff ( Vladimir Sokoloff ) , a rival of Vasiliev for power . He is made to look a tremendous bit like one Leon Trotsky . Get the message from Hollywood here ? Vasiliev's agents have been trying to pin down the news leaks , and has narrowed it to two figures : Thompson , and one Emil Von Hofer ( Sig Ruman ) who is the news representative from Nazi Germany . Ruman manages to demonstrate it ain't him , so ( despite Gable's breezy denials ) Vasiliev believes it is the American . Gable has a close friend in Moscow , one Ygor Yahupitz ( Felix Bressart ) who is his sometimes valet . Ygor's daughter is Galubcha ( Hedy Lamarr ) who is a streetcar operator . Ygor wants Gable to try to smuggle Galubcha out of the Soviet Union into the U . S . And the film shows ( among other things , including overcoming Galubcha's fierce belief in the Communist ideal ) Gable eventually saving both the girl and her father . The comedy is quite amusing , even if it lacks the style and grace of the Lubitsch touch of the first film . But it certainly comments on the atmosphere within Russia in a way that NINOTCHKA failed to do so . The centering of the comedy in Moscow , the suggestiveness of a Stalin - Trotsky rivalry clone , and the heavy control over information is certainly more realistic than Douglas ' being elegant and eloquent about the beauties of Paris . One more thing to keep in mind is a scandal which is on target with this film , and which ( in 1940 ) finally began to raise eyebrows . In the early 1930s the New York Times had a reporter named Walter Duranty in Moscow . He turned out to be a fantastically well informed reporter in the Soviet Union , and came out with interviews and articles that were tremendously informative . In fact , he would win the Pulitzer Prize for his reporting from Moscow . But as time passed , Duranty's methods and sources were heavily questioned . He also tended to take an official line about the Purge Trials ( i . e . , that Bukhanin , Radek , Zinoviev , Tuchochevsky , and the other hundreds and thousands of victims were all actual traitors against the Stalinist regime ) . After the signing of the non-aggression pact with Germany in 1939 , the Times became very suspicious of Duranty , and replaced him . The quality of the articles became very much more even handed . Duranty was later revealed to be a Stalinist agent . Interestingly enough , the Pulitzer Committee has repeatedly rejected requests to take back their award from Duranty's heirs as his work was pure propaganda . So the issue about the control over the news from Russia was very , very real .
Papa's Last Novel	I remember seeing this film when it came out in 1977 . The story of the publication of ISLANDS IN THE STREAM was a major literary story of the late 1970s , as Hemingway's widow found the unpublished novel , and got it published with much fanfare . Of course any time a major artist's work is rediscovered or found for the first time it is a news story . As one of the five premier stylists in American literature , Hemingway's prose is always a matter of interest . But the critics soon pointed out that it was second-rate Hemingway , derivative of other novels ( TO HAVE AND TO HOLD for example ) . Still it was worth reading - as said in another review here , second-rate Hemingway is better than most people's first rate material . George C . Scott is Thomas Hudson , an artist living in semi-retirement in the Bahamas during World War II . He has left the world and it's problems behind him , including his failures as a husband and seemingly as a father of three sons . But that outside world has a habit of catching up to Hudson . One of the most telling moments in the film is when he witnesses from a distance a U-boat attacking some freighter or ship , and subsequently sees wreckage and dead bodies . Even in his corner of the world one wonders if he's escaped to paradise or a fool's paradise . The meaning of the title is those " islands " of contact that we have between ourselves in the " stream " we call life . For Hudson discovers that he can't isolate himself from those islands - they all find him whether they are the forces of an evil German regime or his own family . He is visited by his three sons ( Hart Bochner , Brad Savage , Michael - James Wixted ) in an attempt to come to grips with the boys that he failed as a parent . There is considering bonding while they are together , culminating in one of the best sequences in the film when the youngest boy ( while they are deep sea fishing ) lands a marlin and refuses to release the fishing pole despite the fact that he can't hold onto it forever and his hands are badly cut and bleeding . In the end he loses the marlin , but Bochner ( the oldest son ) tells Scott that the youngest one is the best of them all for his grit in the face of that losing situation . Bochner too springs a surprise - he wants to have Scott's blessing in his decision to join the RAF . Scott is concerned and agrees . Subsequently his concern is justified when his wife ( Clair Bloom ) shows up to tell him that Bochner was killed in action . The critics of the film usually pounce on the latter half , wherein the similarities to TO HAVE AND TO HOLD show up . Hudson gets drawn into rescuing Jewish refugees trying to reach Cuba . In the ensuing events his close friend Eddie ( David Hemmings ) gets killed . Eddie is a " rummy " type , like Walter Brennan's similarly named Eddie in TO HAVE AND TO HOLD . That is an unfortunate similarity . So is the death shortly after ( also from a gun battle in the course of helping the refugees ) of Hudson - which is closer to the actual novel TO HAVE AND TO HOLD than the Bogart film was . But there is one final bit at the end which I thought was a nice cinematic touch . As he is dying , Scott visualizes all the friends and relatives he has gotten close to ( including his surviving sons and his wife and his housekeeper / assistant ) . He sees them all saying goodbye to him . He does not see Bochner or Hemmings , for he is alive and the last thoughts of one passing out of that stream we call life should be of the living . There may be plenty of time for reunions with the dead afterward , but that would be the subject of a different type of novel .
A Film Slightly Ahead Of It's Time About Race Relations and Incest	IN THIS OUR LIFE is like the forgotten serious drama in Bette Davis ' best years at Warner Brothers . Reputedly she did not care for it , but I find that hard to believe . In here half-autobiography , MADAM GODDAMN , Bette mentions that she liked the positive image of Ernest Anderson's character of Parry Clay . For this is the first film I know of where an African-American character is a bright young man who plans to attend law school and become a lawyer . That was ( by itself ) quite a jump . Actually it has more to it than that plot development . Davis and Olivia de Haviland are sisters Stanley and Roy Timberlake , children of Asa and Lavinia Timberlake ( Frank Craven and Billie Burke ) . Craven is an industrious ant , but he's never had the push that his over-bearing brother-in-law William Fitzroy ( Charles Coburn ) has shown over the years ( and pushed down Craven's polite throat ) . Coburn's Fitzroy is interesting for another reason . Before he got his Oscar for his comic turn in THE MORE THE MERRIER , Coburn was cast in all types of role , like the cynical medical investigator Carlos Finley in YELLOW JACK or Lord Dyce , the opponent to Henry Stanley ( Spencer Tracy ) in STANLEY AND LIVINGSTON , or the German scientist working on a cancer cure in IDIOT'S DELIGHT . Here he had one of his villains . Fitzroy has little time for his decent but ( in his opinion ) lightweight brother in law Timberlake . But he loves being with his niece Stanley ( which she is fully aware of ) . The scenes of Coburn and Davis are quite nicely subtle , with his touchy-feely actions obviously meaning more than that of an uncle to his niece . The plot deals with how Roy has been dating with Craig Fleming ( George Brent ) , while Stanley has been pursued by Peter Kingsmill ( Dennis Morgan ) . But Stanley , alluring and totally amoral , is determined to steal Fleming ( who has better future opportunities than Kingsmill ) from her sister . The movie concentrates on the sibling rivalry , which for most of the film Davis's Stanley is winning . But towards the conclusion things begin to unravel for her , and she is involved in a car accident ( a hit and run ) which causes a fatality . Opportunistically , Stanley points the finger of blame at young Parry Clay . The performances and direction ( by John Huston in his second feature ) are actually good . Set in the state of Virginia , Huston actually makes more of the material than perhaps was expected in 1942 Hollywood . When Parry is arrested for the hit and run charge , he is visited by Fleming as his attorney - and for the first time ( again ) that I recall in a Hollywood film we hear a disgusted African-American explain why he has no faith in the system that snatches him up on suspicion ( one thinks today of the issue of racial profiling by police forces - problems have not changed much in sixty years ) . And as things blow up in Stanley's face , she finds that her last chance for escape ( her uncle , Fitzroy ) is a far weaker reed than she or her uncle ever expected . It lacks the pizazz of OF HUMAN BONDAGE , DARK VICTORY , MR . SKEFFINGTON , THE LETTER , JEZEBEL , and THE LITTLE FOXES especially with it's soap opera plot . But Davis does good work as the selfish Stanley , supported by a good cast led by de Haviland as her sister and rival . Not a " 10 " perhaps , but certainly an " 8 " is thoroughly deserved - especially in a film changing racial images and displaying unwholesome family sexual desires .
Finally seeing Harry Langdon in a decent comedy	Although one of the excerpts for Robert Youngson's WHEN COMEDY WAS KING , this short with Harry Langdon is very funny - and shows the comedian as he was advancing to that peak he shared for about a year in the 1920s with Chaplin , Keaton , and Lloyd . Harry and his wife ( Alice Day ) have just moved to a new home , and they are awaiting the cook Harry hired . This cook is a tall , powerful woman who smokes cigars when not cooking or cleaning ( we see her effortlessly toss the washed plates into a cabinet without smashing any ) . The actress who played her is one Louise Carver , but the type would be repeated with endless variations fifteen years later by Marjorie Main . To add to Harry's problems an old acquaintance played by Frank Coleman shows up - and soon is making advances on Harry's wife . The film follows the following plots : 1 ) getting rid of Carver as the house maid . 2 ) watching the activities of Coleman . 3 ) replacing Carver - and trying a new maid who is very French and very taxing on Day ( Madeline Hurlock plays the maid ) . 4 ) operating under all this tension while a power failure and thunderstorm occur - and news comes on about an escaped maniac . For the second half of the short we see a panicking Langdon trying to keep tabs on everyone on the house - including a mysterious bearded man who keeps popping up . What it all adds up to is a great deal of amusing situations particularly with the French maid and the bearded man ( at one point Langdon is aware the man is standing over him while he is reading a mysterious message , and the man covers Langdon's head with his forked beard , and then plucks the message card out of Langdon's head - and then vanishes out the window , while Langdon struggles to look like nothing odd has just happened ! ) . Having seen Langdon a couple of weeks back in one of his lesser , weaker , and final shorts , it is immensely pleasing to see him at his prime . For a good view of what a fine comic he really was see THE FIRST 100 YEARS .
Sportsmanship versus winning at all costs - Little League Style	I never was in the Little League . Probably it was just as well , as I never really got into any sporting activity until I discovered swimming . But my nephew was in the Little League in Connecticut , and his career was distinguished by being in the outfield , and enjoying looking at the sky and clouds , or the green grass , or the back wall - and rarely looking at the thing mattered most : the ball . It has become a commonplace piece of knowledge that for many kids being on a baseball team in the Little Leagues around the country is a nightmare . The kids look forward to the fun of playing baseball games with kids their own age . The problem is that all too often the enjoyment of the game ( and the teaching of good sportsmanship ) are sacrificed for the sake of the grown-ups who are in the background ( parents , patrons of the teams ) and the managers . These grown-ups are only concerned about winning . They have taken the view that winning is the end-all and be-all of living , and that second or third or fourth place in the standings is worthless . Unfortunately too many grown-ups feel this way . After all , how many people are active fans of the real major league teams that constantly are in the cellar ? Occasionally such a team ( the old Brooklyn Dodgers of the 1920s - 1930s or the original New York Mets comes to mind ) do have such a following , but that is a rarity . THE BAD NEWS BEARS was the first film that tackled this problem of bad sportsmanship and enshrining winning within what should be the purest form of baseball . After all , Little League is for kids . . . isn't it ? There are similarities in the film between the character of Morris Buttermaker ( Walter Matthau ) and Tom Hanks ' character in A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN , about the women's baseball league of the Second World War era . Hanks and Matthau have serious drinking problems . Hanks is in the majors with a Chicago team but is washing himself up with management - and takes this job managing the woman's team as a last chance to square things with his boss . Butterworth was a promising rookie in the minor leagues , who once ( in a practice game ) struck out Ted Williams . But contract disputes ( he claims ) prevented him from getting into the majors , and he takes the job managing the Yuma Bears for a salary . It is obvious that the parents behind this ( led by a Councilman played by Ben Piazza ) have little faith in his long dormant abilities - the Councilman even tries to palm off an unsigned check to Butterworth for his services at the beginning ( a real sign of contempt ) . Subsequently the Councilman even drops supporting the team when it loses it's first game by a score of 26 to 0 . Certainly the team is full of misfits , an overweight kid with a loud mouth ( Gary Lee Cavagnaro ) , a would be African-American militant ( Erin Blunt ) , and two Spanish speaking kids ( Jaime Escobedo and George Gonzales ) being only a portion of them . And initially the opportunist in Butterworth makes his work as manager become second-rate ( he rarely trains them when sober , and he even has them assist him in his job as a swimming pool cleaner ) . But their unhappiness at their first defeat is too much . Also there is the unasked for and patronizing advise of fellow Coach Roy Turner ( Vic Morrow , in a good performance ) , who is stressing how embarrassing the Bears are , and how they have no place in the league , and should quit . Matthau takes such a dislike to him that he is determined to turn the team around . He does this first by actually training the team , so they start cohering together ( and start actually playing the game correctly ) . Then he goes after his one great discovery . When he was romancing her mother , Butterworth was training Amanda Whurlitzer ( Tatum O'Neill ) on pitching and fielding , so that she is a powerhouse ( though not as good as a hitter ) . He manages to get her to join the team , agreeing to pay for her ballet classes and for a pair of European jeans she wants . Later he also manages to get another good all-around player , Tanner Boyle ( Chris Barnes ) . The result is that the team soon is zooming up in the League to the point that it and Turner's " Yankees " are to play the deciding game of the summer . Butterworth does not realize that Amanda's willingness to go along with him is based on the hope that he ( a man she actually idolizes ) will marry her mother . As for Tanner , he's a pint-sized hood who happens to decide to join the Bears only because he dislikes the self-important Turner ( who keeps harassing him on the baseball field ) . The final twenty minutes of the movie deals with the " price " the poor kids in both teams pay for the glory of the adults . Butterworth shows a mean opportunism that the kids resent on his team , while Turner manages to permanently louse up his relationship with his son and wife by humiliating the boy for not following his orders . By the way , Turner's son gets one of the best revenges on an adult I've ever seen in any movie dealing with inter-generational and family relationships . Let us just say Turner is not facing a happy future when the film ends . A comedy about an area rarely touched until then in films ( a scene in the James Garner - Kim Novak comedy BOYS NIGHT OUT was one of the few that dealt with Little League before this full study of it ) , THE BAD NEWS BEARS is a nice reaffirmation on what sports is supposed to be about : fun .
The End of the Road With Roach	It follows BLOCK-HEADS and A CHUMP AT OXFORD , two films that are hard to top . Not that SAPS AT SEA is a bad film - it is the last good comedy ( unless one insists on JITTERBUGS or another of the later films ) that Laurel & Hardy made . It's just that it is a toss-off little film , without the crazy destructive crescendo of BLOCK-HEADS or the astounding sight of Stan's " real " personality in A CHUMP AT OXFORD to revel in . At 57 minutes it is shorter than the other two films a bit , but that actually is not a bad point for it . It has just enough time to it to hit the right notes . It's just not as special as the other two . Stan and Ollie work in a factory that manufactures horns . I suspect that there was a bit of Chaplin influence in this sequence ( one recalls a similar assembly-line incident in MODERN TIMES only four years earlier ) . Ollie's nerves finally snap , and he goes on a rampage . He goes home and ( naturally ) his roommate Stan does not help - Stan has a music lesson with an eccentric professor on his instrument ( you've got it - a trombone ) . After beating up the poor professor , Ollie has problems with the incompetent janitor / engineer ( Ben Turpin in a nice brief appearance ) , and then faces his doctor ( Jimmy Finleyson ) and his nerve tester ( a balloon that inflates as you push air out of Ollie's stomach ) . Finleyson announces that it is a bad case of " horniphobia " , and Ollie needs a vacation with plenty of quiet and goat's milk . They end up going to a ship but Ollie and Stan know nothing about seamanship - so they plan to sleep on the ship . Unfortunately the goat gnaws the rope until it breaks and the ship sails off . Also unfortunately , on board is Richard Cramer , an escaped dangerous criminal . This is not going to be a peaceful vacation . SAPS AT SEA ( like A CHUMP ) could have been three shorts , one at the factory , one at the apartment , and one on the boat . Each would have been a successful short , and they all make a funny film - but the stitching of the parts together shows . There are some very amusing moments in the film - the discoveries of how Turpin's ineptitude causes various mishaps with water taps and stoves in the apartment ; the accidental remarks of building manager Charlie Hall when Stan or Ollie runs by him and asks for directions ( " Can you help me find the basement ? " asks Stan - " Certainly , you can't miss it - it's downstairs ! " , says Hall , who realizes what a stupid comment he just made ) ; and Cramer's mistreatment of his two hostage slaves . He calls Ollie " Dizzy " and Stan " Daffy " ( an allusion to the Dean Brothers of the St . Louis Cardinal teams of the 1930s - see Dan Dailey's THE PRIDE OF ST . LOUIS ) . Cramer has the boys cook him up some food - and they make a synthetic meal ( boot laces for spaghetti , for instance ) to get him sick to be overpowered . When he realizes what they have done , he forces them to eat the meal themselves . Their reactions are brilliant . SAPS AT SEA is not on par with the top line of Laurel & Hardy films , but it is a good film on the whole , and a good conclusion to the best years of their film career ( 1927 - 1940 ) when they were with Hal Roach . In the immediate couple of years before it appeared the boys and Roach had serious problems involving production costs ( OUR RELATIONS , where Stan was producer on the film ) , artistic problems ( scenes from SWISS MISS were cut meaninglessly ) , and contractual arguments ( leading to Ollie appearing with Harry Langdon in ZENOBIA ) . Stan and Ollie hit back with THE FLYING DEUCES , wherein the production was not Roach's but Boris Morros ' . At last a two picture deal of A CHUMP AT OXFORD and SAPS AT SEA concluded the arguments and problems - and on a high note the boys left Roach . Unfortunately they never found any subsequent film relationship with a producer as satisfactory as this had been .
The Price of Gallipoli : 1939 - 1945	I have mentioned ( in reviewing the television film , CHURCHILL AND THE GENERALS ) that Sir Winston had a tragically inflated view of his ideas on military strategy . In particular his constant insistence that the way to win wars against a Continental power ( Germany ) was to attack Europe by it's " soft underbelly " . Twice the result was disaster . In World War II it would be the fight for the island of Crete , which actually was a bloodbath for both England and Germany . In World War I it was the Dardanelles Campaign of 1915 , best remembered for the name of one location in the straits involved : Gallipoli . Churchill wanted to use a surprise attack on the Turks to force allied troops into Constantinople and knock the Ottoman Empire out of the war ( and provide a means of supplying the Tsar of Russia and his forces ) . The leadership of this enterprise was in General Sir Ian Hamilton , who was not an inspiring or clever leader . While he spent most of his time on a yacht in the Aegean , tens of thousands of Allied soldiers were killed in a series of stupid , costly attacks . Many of these casualties were known as " Anzacs " . They were volunteer soldiers from the colonies of Australia and New Zealand . And in the end the campaign was a failure . The only positive achievements were that it brought pride to the Turks for defending their territory , and that it brought to the forefront their national hero Mustafa Kemal ( later their President and modernizer , Kemal Ataturk ) . The Australians were not happy at being used as useless cannon fodder . They had only unified the various colonies on the smallest continent in 1901 , and this was ( actually ) their second experience in warfare that didn't benefit them . They had supplied troops for the second Anglo-Boer War ( 1899 - 1902 ) only to have a small flare-up of anger at the questionable court-martial and execution of " Breaker " Morant in that war . The Australians were mostly descended from convicts from Britain , and there were always questions about why they were loyal to the mother country that threw them out . Gallipoli made them even more suspicious . With the coming of World War II the conflict between Britain and Australia would come to a head , and leave Britain with the realization that Australia was going to be less and less likely to be attached to them in the future . Churchill would be the first to discover this . Churchill ( Timothy West here ) became Prime Minister in 1940 due to the failure of the campaign to save Norway from Nazi invasion . Churchill expected that the entire British Commonwealth of Nations would fully support the war effort ( soon he would discover that Eamonn De Valera of Ireland was declaring neutrality for the duration , and there was nothing he could do about it ) . But most unexpected was Australia . The Southern Cross country had just had an election in which the perennially elected Tory Prime Minister Robert Menzies ( John Wood ) was defeated by John Curtin ( Michael Blakemore ) the Labor Party leader . This was unsettling to Churchill , but he figured that Australia would fall in line . It didn't happen that way . Curtin ( whose cabinet included the Australian Prime Minister from World War I , Billy Hughes ( Jon Ewing ) ) was suspicious of any British control over Australian troops . The cabinet ( which was a coalition ) agreed with him . Churchill tried to ignore this , but found his military ideas constantly being questioned by Curtin . After all , Churchill planned Gallipoli . This television film follows how Curtin gradually pulled out all stops to insist that Australia controlled it's own military destiny . Unlike DeValera in Eire , Curtin faced a foe ( the Japanese ) who were soon attacking Port Moresby , and threatening invasion through New Guinea . He wanted all the Australian military reserves used for defending the homeland . Chuchill kept trying to send them to the Middle East and Europe . The crux of the confrontation was when Churchill tried to put Australian troops in Egypt ( to bolster North African defenses ) when Curtin objected . Churchill sent them to Singapore ( closer to Australia geographically ) where they were all captured when the " Gibraltar of the East " fell to Japan . Slowly Curtin begins to reverse the history of Australia , and tie it's future to it's cousin country the United States . The commander of Australia's forces , General Tom Blamey ( Ray Barrett ) works closely with General Douglas MacArthur ( Robert Vaughn ) in the struggle in New Guinea . Blamey's men reverse the Japanese advance , allowing the Americans to send in reinforcements . MacArthur was always grateful and respectful to Blamey ( who he made sure was present at the Japanese surrender on the U . S . S . Missouri in 1945 ) . Curtin died before the war ended , but he knew that he had made his point to the mother country about his nation's coming of age . Churchill underplayed the slap in his face , but realized that Curtin's activities were one more step in the replacement of Britain by the U . S . as the world's superpower . The film followed this little known story ( little known here in the U . S . ) quite well . Timothy West has played Churchill several times , and has the great man's brilliance and arrogance down pat . Blakemore plays Curtin as a decent man who finds a world crisis on his watch , and rises truly to the occasion . Wood is wasted - Menzies got stuck in London as part of the Imperial War Cabinet , so he was ( oddly enough ) out of the loop of Australian politics during much of the war . Ironically one side of his London period is ignored : in 1942 there was a move to try to replace Churchill . Menzies , with his long service as Australian Premier was seen as an alternative . But military news started improving , and the coup never occurred . As for Barrett as Blamey , he makes the General sympathetic by showing his struggles with a helpless Curtin for supplies , and slowly winning Vaughn's MacArthur's respect as a fighter . As a historical television film it was quite good ,
Atypical Flynn War Film	Errol Flynn always wanted to prove that he was a dramatic actor of range , not an athletic non-entity who was always demonstrating his abilities as a horseman , a fighter , or a swordsman . That his best adventure films did show him as more than just an acrobat he barely understood . He wanted to play normal types . But normal types look more like Walter Matthau or Paul Muni or Allan Jenkins - they are not the strikingly handsome Flynn . In 1944 Flynn did this film which was a war picture but not like DIVE BOMBER or OBJECTIVE : BURMA . The film was about a French criminal who had committed a murder and was tried and convicted for that homicide . He is able to escape the guillotine when a bomb hits the prison just as the execution is about to occur . He flees , and manages to get into the countryside . Pursuing him is Paul Lucas , the French police inspector who arrested him originally . Lucas finds Flynn , but at that time an act of sabotage against the Nazis occurs . When the Nazis threaten to kill 100 French hostages unless the saboteurs appear , Flynn offers Lucas a " devil's " choice : If Lucas will not act for the next few days , Flynn will surrender himself to the Nazis as the saboteur ( he prefers being shot by a firing squad rather than being guillotined ) . Lucas has little real choice - unless he is willing to do the same thing instead of Flynn . But will Flynn keep his word or not ? As Flynn meets a young girl and finds that they can flee away together , the audience wonders if he'll do the heroic thing or not . Flynn is pretty good in this cynical part . It is obvious , once he makes the offer to Lucas , that he really planned not to go through with it . It is also true that as the moment of truth arises he gradually sees the hideous tragedy that his self-interest is likely to cause many families . The glimpse at occupied French society is also good , showing the victims and the collaborators . It is almost as good as the picture of that society in THIS LAND IS MINE . Yet the film , produced by a company that Flynn was involved in , and selected by him , failed at the box office . The public did not quite accept a thinking man's Errol Flynn instead of the adventurous sexy star of THE SEA HAWK or GENTLEMAN JIM . It set back further attempts by Flynn to find straight dramatic parts . It also verified that Jack Warner , Flynn's studio boss , was a really smart man in knowing what the public liked or did not like for their stars .
James Hilton takes on " The Crippen Case "	James Hilton's track record in movies based on his novels is pretty good . LOST HORIZON , GOODBYE MR . CHIPS , and RANDOM HARVEST were turned into first rate films . RAGE IN HEAVEN was less successful . But there is also this fine tragedy about two simple people who are embroiled in circumstances that not only destroy them but blacken their memories . Paul Muni is a doctor in a small country town , married to Flora Robson . They have a son . Robson is a tad domineering , and Muni is subservient . Jane Bryan is a German woman who is in England just as World War I begins . Hated by the xenophobes in the country , Bryan is hired as a nanny by Robson . She gets closer to Muni and his son , much to the dismay of Robson . Robson is a hypochondriac , and when she has a headache she wants some medicine . Her son brings the wrong pill , and she dies as a result . Bryan was preparing to leave the town with Muni's assistance , when they are arrested ( appearing as they do to be about to skip out ) . They are tried for the murder , and circumstantial evidence conspires to condemn them . They are executed before the movie ends . The description does not do justice to the story . Hilton's novel is based loosely on the Crippen Case ( see THE SUSPECT ) , except that it is taking the point that Crippen was not guilty ( some people who felt sorry for Dr . Crippen felt he was never been able to show he did not commit his wife's murder ) . Also , Hilton is reexamining the extreme xenophobia that swept Great Britain in 1914-1918 towards Germany and it's people and culture ( a similar xenophobia would hit the U . S . from 1915 to 1918 , culminating in such acts as calling frankfurters " hot dogs " and banning German operas from the Metropolitan Opera House ) . In this respect the film is of considerable historical interest . Finally Hilton is into the running irony of the plot . While in prison Muni philosophizes about the circumstances leading to his and Bryan's fates , and it turns out that he realizes that the powers that be that have helped craft their ill-deserved demise are the same bunch of idiots causing the massive slaughter known as World War I . Hence the ironic title of the film - it is more than the story of the destructions of two innocent people in a botched trial . It is the story of the destruction of millions by elected fools . Of particular note in an outstanding cast are Henry Daniell and Una O'Connor . Daniell is as unsympathetic as normal , but here he actually is the public prosecutor . While the film audience realizes he has misread the evidence and is railroading two innocent people to the gallows , one has to remember he does not know this but looks at the evidence as accumulating to pointing out the guilt of Muni and Bryant . Actually he is a very effective prosecutor ( and his character , Sir Ronald Dawson , seems based on Crippen's very effective prosecutor , Sir Richard Muir ) . O'Connor is Bryant's foe due to Bryant's German background , and she does testify against her . But as she does she slowly realizes that she is putting the noose around the necks of both Muni and Bryant , and it does not sit well with her . The last three minutes of the film concentrate on her , as she realizes Muni and Bryant are dead , and as she confronts evidence that they have not lived in vain . The conclusion is reaffirming and heartbreaking at the same time .
Jamaica Inn , Take Two	This television version of the novel is actually closer to the story than the Hitchcock film of 1939 . In particular , my best memory of it was the handling of the actual head of the smuggler / wreckers . In the film it was Laughton playing a regency buck country squire ( who was in a purgatory because of the idiots who surrounded a man of his taste ) . Here it is John McEnery as Reverend Davie , a fake clergyman who turned out to be one of the last practicing Druids in Cornwall . His death at the conclusion was quite impressive because he was allowed to behave as though it was a serious religious matter . It was a good conclusion to this version , which was perhaps too long but made the story a bit more coherent .
" Only a Gypsy Knows '	This is one of the large number of Paramount musicals for " Der Bingle " in the 1930s and 1940s , that are mostly pleasant feasts for lovers of his crooning , entertaining in their own right , but forgettable after watching . They all have high points in them , but the films that people remember for showing Crosby the actor were made after 1940 . Then came his pair of performances as Father O'Malley , his visit to the court of Franz Joseph in THE EMPEROR'S WALTZ , and eventually movies like THE COUNTRY GIRL and HIGH SOCIETY . Perhaps the best to say about the early Crosby films was they gave him the training to become the fine serious actor he turned into . They also were adequate comic training for his series of " Road " films with Bob Hope and Dorothy Lamour . The best portions of this film ( aside from Crosby's singing ) is Bea Lillie's comic points . Although she would have a long film career ( she was , if you recall , the villain in THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE in the middle 1960s ) Ms Lillie's basic career was as a satirist and stage clown . With her ladylike ways and soft speech she would sit on stage singing a song about " Fairies at the Bottom of My Garden " , and suddenly you were listening to a devastating criticism about modern culture . That was never ( as far as I know ) put on film . But her routine about buying " a Dozen Double Damasque Dinner Napkins " ( from poor , flustered Franklin Pangborn ) gradually roles off their betwixt and be-twiddled tongues as " a dibble dizen madeques riddle nipkins " or whatever they come up with . She also does a lovely spoof of gypsy love songs , " Only a Gypsy Knows " , that includes her bashing around with a tambourine , and yelling a friendly " Hiya ! " at one point . I recommend the film for fans of " Der Bingle " , but also for those masters of tongue-twisted , genteel comedy , Lillie and Pangborn .
A Slight , Charming Comedy From a Different Age	Lawrence Olivier and Merle Oberon did two movies together within two years . One is considered one of the great romantic films of all time , and the movie that made Olivier a great movie star ( and gave Oberon her best performance role ) : WUTHERING HEIGHTS . The other is this film , made in England a year earlier . THE DIVORCE OF LADY X is a romantic comedy ( as WUTHERING HEIGHTS is a romantic tragedy ) . Olivier is a lawyer , Everard Logan , who is a dynamic barrister , but is also a total misogynist . One night he checks into a hotel just ahead of a crowd of people . It is a very foggy night ( the type of pea soup fog that London was known for up until a notorious " killer " fog in the 1950s ) , and the crowd ( who'd been attending a party in the hotel ) need beds . The management tries to get Logan to allow one or two socialite ladies to sleep on a couch and a day bed in his rooms , but he refuses . But he has not reckoned with Merle Oberon as Leslie Steele . The granddaughter of a high court judge , she manages to get into Logan's rooms and manipulates him to not only agree to her sleeping there , but appropriates his bed ( he goes onto the couch - much to his discomfort ) . The next day they share a breakfast , and in the smalltalk it is evident that despite his mistrust of women Logan finds Leslie very attractive . But she kittenishly refuses to tell him her name . She is determined to learn more about him , and she finds his attitude toward women infuriating . In the meantime , Logan is approached by a wealthy nobleman ( Ralph Richardson as Lord Mere ) as a potential client . Mere suspects his wife Lady Mere ( Binnie Barnes ) of having an affair . In fact , he tells Logan her Ladyship was with her lover in the hotel that Logan knows he was in on the night of the fog . Logan ( naturally ) jumps to the conclusion that Lady Mere was his mysterious roommate that night . I will not go into the plot any further , except to say that Leslie eventually realizes what a mistake Logan has made , and decides to use it to teach him a lesson about women . The script has the feel of a Wodehouse novel , but is slighter . Still the performances of Olivier , Oberon , Richardson , Barnes , and Morton Selden ( as Oberon's grandfather ) are all splendid . It shows what a good cast can do with even the slightest of materials . Take a look at some of the minor scenes to see what I mean : Selden's first scene , complaining about his weak coffee to his butler / valet , who tells him off properly ( they've been used to each other's personalities for years ) . Or Olivier dealing with a young clerk in his office , who is certain there were two Lady Meres in the office two minutes before ( there were , but Oberon and Barnes left together ) , and ends up thinking the poor clerk is a simpleton . Or the waiter in the hotel who can't understand why the tenant in Olivier's room is constantly changing from a man to a woman to a man . As I said , a slight charming comedy - but it is very charming .
A Bit Better Than A Mere Curiosity	I saw this film once on the American Movie Classics Channel ( about 1999 ) . Laurel & Hardy gained an international audience in the silent film period , mostly due to the physical nature of their comedy , but also because it being silent the dialog could be covered from one non-English speaking country to another with dialog cards that were in the language of that country . Along came the coming of sound and they faced the loss of most of their audience ( the idea of dubbing had not taken root yet ) . So Hal Roach and the boys constructed a number of films in the period from 1930 to 1931 that were in German , Spanish , and French . Not all of these films have survived - one in particular is sorely missed : the French version of PARDON US , in which the villain played by Walter Long is played by an up-and-coming performer named Boris Karloff . It was Karloff's only appearance with Stan and Ollie , and only a single still photo ( of him threatening them in the prison yard ) still exists . POLITIQUERIAS was the Spanish version of the short CHICKENS COME HOME , wherein Ollie is a successful businessman who is the reform candidate for Mayor . A shoe-in , he is unsettled by the discovery that a former girlfriend is threatening to reveal their relationship unless he pays her up . But she is trying to force him to see her that very night , when he is entertaining the reform leadership at his home . So he sends Stan to occupy her until he can visit himself . Naturally , Stan will screw up and she will show up at the Hardy mansion . The English version , that most fans are aware of , is about twenty five minutes long . But the Spanish version was quite a bit longer - almost a mini-feature film . In the English version Hardy's dinner party is taken for granted - he is the host who is trying to keep a good face before his biggest supporters , and in the face of increasing heat from his suspicious wife . On top of that his butler , Jimmy Finlayson , is blackmailing him continuously ( William Everson pointed out , in THE COMPLETE FILMS OF LAUREL & HARDY that while Finlayson is usually the social superior of the boys in their films , here , although he is a servant , he still getting the better of Ollie ) . Also , there are some cuts to Stanley's failure to control the other woman ( Mae Busch , of course ) , and how a friend of Mrs . Hardy ( a dried up old prude ) follows Stan and acts as a vindictive bolt of lightning on the boys . In this Spanish version Hardy's party takes center stage , with his hired entertainment acts being filler between the story line sequences . In particular there is the scenes with Hadji-Ali , the great regurgitator of the music halls and vaudeville houses of Europe and America . Oddly enough , a few years ago , in a special documentary about magicians and the like , the footage of Hadji-Ali from POLITIQUERIAS was used to demonstrate his remarkable act . He also teaches Jimmy Finlayson a lesson , when he uses him as an assistant in his act , and Jimmy gets soaked as a result . That the sound of that Scottish voice and that Georgian voice are now struggling with phonetically written Spanish is not a negative . Both do well enough , and it does not harm an English speaking audience , who would recall the English version . The film remains funny for the boys work and Finlayson , and one gets a rare opportunity to see a one time headliner who astounded audiences with his curious magic act .
George gets his " canonization " from Hollywood .	Leslie Charteris ' series of novels of the adventures of the slightly shady Simon Templar ( " The Saint " ) was brought to the screen in the late 1930s with the up and coming George Sanders as Templar . It was a careful choice - Sanders usually would play villains with occasional " nice roles " ( ffoliott in FOREIGN CORRESPONDENCE , the title hero in THE STRANGE CASE OF UNCLE HARRY , the framed " best friend " of Robert Montgomery in RAGE IN HEAVEN ) . Here his willingness to bend the rules and break a law briefly fit his " heavy persona " , while his good looks and suave behavior made Templar a fit shady hero like Chester Morris ' " Boston Blackie " , and ( to an extent ) Peter Lorre's " Mr . Moto " . The films are not the best series of movie mystery serials - but they are serviceable . Like Rathbone's Holmes series or Oland's Chan's series the show frequently had actors repeating roles or playing new ones ( the anti-heroine in the film here was played by Wendy Barrie , who would show up in a second film in the series ) . This , and slightly familiar movie sets make the series a comfortable experience for the viewers , who hear the buzz of the dialog ( always showing Sanders ' braininess in keeping one step ahead of the bad guys ) , without noting the obvious defects of the plot . All these mysteries have defects due to the fact that even the best writers of the genre can't avoid repeating old ideas again and again and again . Here the moment when that happened was when one of the cast admitted his affection for Barrie , which she was long aware of . Shortly after he tries to protect her from the police . But as the film dealt with the identity of a criminal mastermind , it became obvious that this person was made so slightly noble as to merit being the mysterious mastermind ( i . e . , the script disguised him as the least likely suspect ) . Barrie is after the proof that her father ( who died in prison ) was framed by the real criminals in a robbery gang . She has several people assisting her - mugs like William Gargan - and she gets advice from the mastermind on planning embarrassing burglaries that can't be pinned on her . The D . A . who got her father convicted ( Jerome Cowan ) is determined to get Barrie and her gang . The only detective who seems to have a chance to solve the case is Jonathan Hale , who is shadowing Sanders but reluctantly working with him . The cast has some nice moments in the script - Hale ( currently on a special diet ) is tempted to eat a rich lobster dinner made for Sanders by Willie Best . He gets a serious upset stomach as a result , enabling Sanders and Barrie to flee Sanders ' apartment . Best has to remind him ( when he feels better ) to head for a location that Sanders told him to go to at a certain time . There is also an interesting role for Gilbert Emery . Usually playing decent people ( like the brow-beaten husband in BETWEEN TWO WORLDS ) he plays a socially prominent weakling here - whose demise is reminiscent of that of a character in a Bogart movie . On the whole a well made film for the second half of a movie house billing in 1939 . It will entertain you even if it does not remain in your memory .
John Ford's Civil War	John Ford probably did more to glorify the old American Cavalry of the 19th Century than any other major Hollywood Director . But while the Civil War is an element that keeps turning up in his movies , he never actually did do the Civil War film he wanted to do - a biography of the career of Ulysses Grant . In his career he tackled the Civil War three times . In PRISONER OF SHARK ISLAND he dealt with the story of Dr . Samuel Mudd , who was sentenced to life imprisonment for involvement in Lincoln's Assassination . In HOW THE WEST WAS WON , Ford did the segment dealing with the battle of " SHILOH " , with Harry Morgan as General Grant and John Wayne as General Sherman . This film was the nearest that Ford ever got to his dream film . THE HORSE SOLDIERS was the only film that was devoted to a full study of the effect of the war in the South , on both Union and Rebel soldiers . While not , perhaps , the best that Ford could have achieved - he was in the twilight of his master career - it is a fine film none-the-less . The story is based on an incident in 1863 known as Grierson's Raid . Cavalry leader Benjamin Grierson was sent by Grant into Alabama and Mississippi on a raid to attack a railway junction , supposedly to destroy it for strategic reasons . While it was important to knock the railway junction out of effective work , the real purpose was to tie up Confederate forces in these backwaters . Since December 1862 Grant was struggling to capture the city of Vicksburg , Mississippi , the last major Confederate stronghold on the Mississippi River . But try as he did Grant kept losing to the Confederates under Joseph Johnston and John C . Pemberton ( the commander in Vicksburg ) . But Grant had noticed how Confederate cavalry men like Earl Van Dorn and Nathan Bedford Forrest had forced him to use men to protect his supply lines , and took valuable time away from him trying to fight off or track them down . He decided that Grierson , a first rate Cavalry leader , could do the same thing to Johnston . A very intelligent Confederate Commander , Johnston was nervous at unexpected difficulties . Grant reasoned that Grierson's men would panic Johnston , and cause him to waste time chasing him down . As it turned out Grierson's Raid worked . The pinning down of large numbers of Rebel troops in Alabama and Missisippi was wonderful for Grant's Vicksburg campaign . It was the beginning of the successful conclusion of the campaign , as Johnston's attention was now split between trying to help support Pemberton and trying to reassure frightened southern populations in the hinterlands . Grierson got most of his men back to Northern lines . Vicksburg was able to hold out until July 4 , 1863 . It's fall ( the day after Lee's defeat at Gettysburg ) really marked the beginning of the end of the Civil War . This incident is the basis for THE HORSE SOLDIERS . Ford concentrates on what the experience of the war must have been like in the Southern countryside . Certain things are taken from other incidents and battlefields . When a military school's cadets are brought into the field to try to catch or slow down John Wayne's men , Ford is really picking up on an incident in the war in Virginia , when the young cadets at the Virginia Military Institute came out to fight the Union troops under Sheridan in 1864 . One can forgive the transition of the incident . It has been pointed out that one of the characters , Colonel Secord ( Willis Bouchey ) is a splendid type - the political officer . Men like Secord ( usually in the position of General ) bedeviled both sides , because of their usually normal level of mediocrity or idiocy . A few rose to the job well - the best of the Northern political generals was " Black Jack " Logan , who would be a valuable associate of Sherman in the battles around Atlanta . But for every positive General Logan , there were thieves like Benjamin " Spoons " Butler , who feathered his nest as military governor of New Orleans ( he supposedly stole even the silver spoons of the citizenry ) . Actually Secord is normally intelligent , and follows Wayne's strategy . But he is constantly looking ahead at post-war elections . Towards the end he even wonders if the White House beckons . Another lovely moment shows the fraying of the Southern cause . Wayne and his men come across two Rebel deserters ( Strother Martin and Denver Pyle ) who have tied up the local sheriff ( Russell Simpson ) . Wayne thanks Martin and Pyle for their unofficial assistance to the Northern cause , telling them which way they plan to go . While Martin chatters away ( mentioning the strength of Rebel forces in the area ) , Wayne carefully knocks out Pyle and then Martin , and then unties Simpson and assists in tying up the two deserters . William Holden is watching this , and later asks why he helped Simpson . Wayne explains that he decided to feed the deserters false information about his own movements , as they would probably give the information to the Confederates later on anyway . All the performances are fine , with Wayne in particular as a man who hates doctors and medicine for a valid personal reason . Holden is in a subordinate role but he gets some nice moments . So does Constance Towers , in a rare leading part , as a passionate Confederate supporter who gradually gets to like Wayne . Carleton Young , as a former friend of Wayne , has a moment trying to rally Confederate forces at the railway depot . It is a good Ford film , and makes one wish that Ford had made his Ulysses Grant biography .
Above Average Mystery with a gimmick	This is one of those mysteries where a talented amateur ( George C . Scott ) slowly unravels what the police ( despite having all the resources ) can't seem to figure out . Anthony Gethryn is a friend of the family of the Eark of Glenyre ( Colin Brook ) . One of the cousins of the Earl's current heir ( his grandson ) is Adrian Messenger ( John Merrivale ) who is an author . Messenger has been working on what he calls a mystery plot , which he mentions vaguely , but with some ill-ease , to Gethryn . It seems he has been tracing a series of people he ( Messenger ) knew who have mostly died in grotesquely horrible accidents . He promises to tell Gethryn about it , but he has to take an air flight on business . Earlier we saw an odd looking religious man handing in a package that was supposed to go on the plane . Naturally the plane blows up killing most of the passengers and crew . But a badly injured ( actually dying ) Messenger tells the surviving passenger ( Jacques Roux - Raoul Le Borg ) a message for Gethryn . It is a long disjointed message , and Gethryn does get it after Roux is picked up ( by then the sole survivor of the bombed plane ) . Gethryn slowly works out the message on a set of blackboards with the assistance of the recovered Roux and Lady Jocelyn ( Dana Wynter ) and Sir Wilfred Lucas ( Herbert Marshall ) . Gradually he realizes that the list of names are of men who were prisoners of war with Messenger , and that they and others were betrayed by another man who will kill anyone who is in his way to claim a large estate . The gimmick of this film ( which makes it a guessing game , but also ruins the mystery to some extent ) was to guess who were the celebrities in cameo roles in this film . The five celebrities were Burt Lancaster , Kirk Douglas , Robert Mitchum , Frank Sinatra , and Tony Curtis . In the case of Lancaster , Mitchum , Sinatra , and Curtis the disguises are not too bad ( although Mitchum bone structure is a dead give-away . But Douglas ( and I am not ruining the story to say this ) is in four disguises , and like Mitchum it is just too difficult to hide his bone structure . One of his disguises , by the way , looks like Dr . Hawley Crippen . Despite the gimmick taking one's attention away from the actual mystery , the film is a good one , well directed by John Huston ( who has a cameo here as well , as does his son ) , and has some nice countryside photography - particularly of the final fox hunt . It is a decently made , above average mystery .
Who Will Get the Reward ?	In this episode of the popular series , the basic story plot deals with a wealthy woman ( Hillary Pritchard ) who is in Grace Brothers and discovers that she has dropped a valuable jewel in the store . She offers a large reward . Mr . Rumbold ( Nicholas Smith ) tries ( in his own way - with his own agenda ) to organize the search for the missing item . There is an attempt at cooperative searching but soon male v . female antagonisms , and class antagonisms ( Captain Peacock - Frank Thornton - v . the others ) splinter the attempt at cooperation . In fact , only one person ( Mr . Grainger - Arthur Borough ) seems willing to work with all the others . What follows is a typical " Mad , Mad , Mad , Mad World " every - person-for-him-or-herself attempt by the characters to find the jewel and give it to the woman first . This leads to several odd and humorous situations , such as Mr . Lucas ( Trevor Bannister ) trying to " surreptitiously " put his foot over the jewel , without Peacock ( who is standing over it ) noticing Lucas ' foot between his own . But soon missing jewels turn up with alarming frequency , and the question arises of not so much who will find the jewel but which one found the actual jewel in question . As in most episodes the arrival of Young Mr . Grace ( Harold Bennett ) helps settle the matter , but also prevents everyone from getting what they wanted .
In the days of the three crooning sensations .	This is an amusing old cartoon I saw twenty or so years ago . An Indian tribe has a problem - the woman all love Bing Crosby , Rudy Vallee , and Ross Columbo ( three of the four leading crooners of the 1920s into the 1940s , with Al Jolson probably being the fourth ) . Now , some seventy seven years later , the cartoon probably raises questions among the young watching it : they might recall Crosby , who had a great movie career ( with or without his pal Bob Hope ) copped by an Oscar , as well as a leading singing career - best known for " White Christmas " . They can possibly be aware of Rudy Vallee due to his performances in some film , culminating in his repeating his stage triumph as " J . P . Biggley " in HOW TO SUCCEED IN BUSINESS WITHOUT REALLY TRYING , but it is hard for me to believe they would recall his megaphone antics with songs like , " There is a tavern in the town " or " The Wippenproof Song " . By the end of the 1930s , while still popular he was nowhere near Crosby in popularity . Columbo is the real problem . Most of his songs are long forgotten ( except by his fans of course ) , and he is best recalled for his bizarre death ( shot " accidentally " ( ? ) by a very close male friend shortly after announcing his engagement to actress Carole Lombard ) . Whether it was murder of not , it is his taking off that most people recall . It's too bad , because he was a good singer , and quite handsome . He might have gone as far as Crosby . The little jingle tune in honor of the three ( with the singer doing imitations of them in the course of the song ) is what I most recall from this cartoon . It was not a great song , but it was lively . So was the animation , leading up to a forest fire , and the rescue of a nest of birds . It is a sweet cartoon - of a somewhat gentler time in our culture .
Mark Twain's Civil War	This film was part of a series put on Channel 13 in 1980 - 1982 or so of movies based on stories or novels by Mark Twain . These included THE INNOCENCE ABROAD , THE MYSTERIOUS STRANGER , THE MAN WHO CORRUPTED HADLEYBURG , and LIFE ON THE MISSISSIPPI . The critics , on the whole , were not enthralled by these films , feeling that the originals could not be touched , but as most of them were of relatively unused works of Twain ( unlike HUCKLEBERRY FINN , TOM SAWYER , A CONNECTICUT YANKEE IN KING ARTHUR'S COURT , and THE PRINCE AND THE PAUPER ) , it was actually quite a worthy undertaking . Also it attracted some good actors . Donald Ogden Stiers appeared ( as did Barry Morse ) in THE INNOCENCE ABROAD . Fred Gwynne was in THE MYSTERIOUS STRANGER . Robert Preston was in THE MAN WHO CORRUPTED HADLEYBURG . Robert Lansing was in LIFE IN THE MISSISSIPPI . And the cast of this film included Pat Hingle and Edward Herrmann . I think that after two decades in storage somewhere they should be taken out and shown again on public television . Mark Twain was born in Hannibal , Missouri , which ( during the Civil War ) was a " neutral " border state . His section was more pro-south than pro-north . He briefly joined the Confederate army with a group of his young friends , and after a few adventures ( or misadventures ) he and most of them deserted . A handful fought for the Confederate States until the end of the war . Twain , himself , accompanied his brother as a secretary to a government appointment in the Nevada territory , thus leaving the immediate theater of the war's activities . In the 1870s and 1880s a new literary form appeared in American magazines and published in book form as well : the Civil War memoirs . Twain's own Webster Publishing Co . would publish General Grant's great memoirs in 1885 , and then publish General Sheridan's , General McClellan's , and several others . General Sherman's memoirs appeared in 1876 . The Confederate Generals published too , Jubal Early , Richard Taylor , James Longstreet being three of the best writers . At one point , to spoof this trend , Twain published a long short story of the title " THE PRIVATE HISTORY OF A CAMPAIGN THAT FAILED " recounting his less than heroic adventures . It is a very informative story . He explains that he and his friends were full of the romantic ideas of Sir Walter Scott's novels about chivalry and glory , and they decided to volunteer . Unfortunately , soon after they begin , the cracks in the system pop up . Their personalities clash on certain issues ( one of the boys , named " Dunlap " shows a pretentious nature by calling himself " D'Unlap " to sound like a French knight ) . They keep falling into mud holes . They keep finding that most of the time they get lost , can't find where the real fighting is , and at one point think they hear a Yankee soldier approach , and fire . They wound a civilian , who is absolutely in shock when they try to assist him after finding out their mistake . Finally , hearing of the approach of a really overwhelming enemy force , Twain and most of the men give up and leave . It turns out the overwhelming force was one under General Ulysses Grant . The film basically follows the story , except that Pat Hingle plays a local southern sympathizer ( a farmer ) with two daughters . He is full of patriotism for the lost cause , and tries to assist the young southern patriots . But when he discovers they retreated or ran from the enemy he kicks them out in disgust . The portion of the story dealing with the wounding of the innocent traveler is changed in an interesting way . Edward Herrmann plays a local clergyman who is shot by the boys , and killed - not wounded . It is this act of total destruction of a human being ( a clergyman too - and a married one ) that leads to Twain and the others ending their military careers in the television version . But here the film actually went into a further different direction . In 1898 Twain wrote a short story called THE WAR PRAYER . Bitterly opposed to the trend towards imperialism in the U . S . , and in the Spanish American War and Philippine Insurrection , Twain's story is how at a patriotic church meeting the clergyman lauding the militarist version of the truth is confronted by a stranger who offers a new prayer for our men at war . It begs God to destroy the enemy utterly , man , woman , and child - let us grind them into itsy-bitsy pieces , etc . At the end the stranger shrieks " AMEN ! ! ! " and leaves . The shocked clergyman says nothing for a moment and then says to the congregation that the stranger must be insane . He doesn't notice that his own views are similar , but just watered down . The film ends with the ghost of Herrmann , thirty years later , wandering into a church in the period of the 1898 war . He hears the pompous , militarist clergyman glorifying the same warlike feelings that destroyed him in 1861 . Angry , Herrmann becomes the " mad " stranger , and what follows is THE WAR PRAYER in it's full effect . Wesley Addy completes this section as the self-blind clergyman . It was a very good production , and , again , I hope it is shown again some time on public television .
Red Buttons attempt at a television come-back .	I was twelve years old , and I recall watching this show on television when I visited my grandparents . It was a cleverly written piece of fluff about how the U . S . government's spy agency ( headed by Fred Clark ) has been following a notorious spy and is about to spring a trap on him . What happens to the spy was shown in the first episode , but in later episodes it became the opening lines of the show's theme song , partly sung by Clark ( who rarely sang - actually he talk sang , like Rex Harrison in MY FAIR LADY ) : " This is about a great spy named U - 31 . On his first day here , he was killed by a hit-and-run . Clark : " Got to find a spy who looks just like U - 31 but who ? " Pause - Clark again , facing Buttons : " Henry Phyfe ! " Clark explains to his staff , that U - 31 is one of the most effective spies in the world , and he should be followed and confronted by what they have - and forced to become a double agent . Instead , a European , he is seen rushing across a street pursued by Clark's men , and looked the wrong way ( instead of left to right traffic when crossing our streets , right to left , like in England ) . So he's hit by a car and killed . Clark is upset because he needed U - 31 as an effective double agent . Soon he finds a new replacement , a downtrodden clerk called Henry Phyfe ( also played by Buttons ) . But the plot of this show was that Buttons is reluctant ( at best ) to assist the government in it's spying activities . He is constantly trying to get out of helping , and Clark is constantly manipulating Phyfe into doing he wants . Formula comedy perhaps , but Clark and Buttons had good chemistry , and the stories were actually funny . In one episode , Phyfe's susceptibility to hypnosis is used by Clark , the enemy ( presumably the Russians ) , a young woman he is dating , and his usual girlfriend , to the point that at the conclusion nobody is sure which of the hypnotized states in Phyfe's mind is working ( he ends the tension by handing the gun he is holding at the four people involved to Clark , begging him to take it because he's going crazy ) . In another one , Phyfe is set up by the enemy to assassinate an important figure ( it turns out to be Clark ) , and manages to bungle the attack - but Clark realizes that it helps cement Phyfe's role as duplicitous U - 31 to make it look like the attack was a success . So he is photographed " badly wounded " in his office , so that the enemy believes U-31 was doing what he was told . It was a good show . All my memories of it are quite warm . But it only lasted one season . I've often wondered if it was low ratings or what . Fred Clark died two years later ( 1968 ) , so one wonders if the producers realized that he was not going to last long enough to work so well with Buttons . Or did Buttons start doing to this show what he had done on his more famous 1950s variety show , throwing his weight around with the writing staff , and driving his producers to distraction . Or did people feel that it just was not in the same class as the contemporary spy spoof GET SMART ? It should have lasted three or four years , under normal circumstances . It's failure remains a deep puzzle for me .
What that Revolution really needed were two good female revolutionaries	This was an amusing film , which was the first movie that I saw starring either Bridget Bardot or Jeanne Moreau . I actually saw it on a double bill back in 1965 . It is of interest because it brings up a matter that American films about Mexico's Revolution ( or that of the other Latin American Countries ) rarely touch upon . This is the position of the Roman Catholic Church in these matters . The only time the issue of the Church and the Revolutionaries came up in American films was in the John Ford / Henry Fonda movie " The Fugitive " . That ( based on Graham Greene's novel " The Power And The Glory " ) dealt with the anti-Clericalism of the PRI regimes that ruled the country after 1920 . In it Fonda is a fugitive priest who is trying to continue his religious role , despite the anti-clericalism of the regime . Greene ( and Ford ) were good Catholics , and stressed the negative actions of the revolutionary regime in Mexico ( similar to the anti-religious viewpoint of the Communist regime in Russia ) . But the view barely notes why the anti-Clericalism developed . One of the largest land owning groups in Mexico ( and in most of Latin America's countries ) was the Church . And , due to the holdings , the Church tended to be rather conservative politically . In the 19th Century the greatest figure of reform in Mexico was Benito Juarez , who was from a poor native Indian background . But most of his career was in trying to strengthen Mexican democratic government , and to drive the French invasion ( that briefly set up Archduke Maximillian of Austria ) as Emperor . But after the French were driven out , Juarez spent the remainder of his years in office ( 1867 - 1872 ) trying to get through some kind of fair land reform . This did not sit well with the Church . It supported the regime of his successor ( Porfirio Diaz ) , who was opposed to land reform - he invited foreign investors ( many Americans ) into Mexico . Diaz's policies were good in giving Mexico a stable economy and political peace for three decades ( the longest growth period until the later 20th Century ) . The key character to watch in " Viva Maria " is Francisco Regueira , who plays the sinister Father Superior . It is he who is constantly in communication with the dictator , the landowner , and their minions . The role ( as is the film ) is played for laughs , but it is his behavior , conspiring against the two Marias and their friends , which is telling . The plot is interesting in bringing in the universality of revolution . Bardot is shown growing up , the daughter of an Irish revolutionary , constantly destroying British forts and other sites with his daughter assisting . When she joins forces with Moreau the latter's sister has committed suicide , so that she needs Bardot to replace the sister . It is a circus group , but Bardot and Moreau do a singing and strip-tease act . They are brought into the Mexican Revolution by the brutality of the local landowner ( who rules like he has a mini-kingdom ) . The film was pure escapism : the circus group's resident marksman finds one of his special rifles is badly bent after an explosion - he doesn't throw it out , but attach-es a mirror to the barrel and uses the bent gun to shoot people around the corner . George Hamilton plays a local " Zapata " type hero , who is wounded and in hiding . When Bardot speaks in his honor , the members of the circus group listen to her words comments critically on her use of language , and on his theatricality - as though she is acting on stage . It is not a major film , even for director Louis Malle ( don't compare it with " Atlantic City " , for example ) . But as an enjoyable romp it's worth watching .
No Good - Bad Turn Goes Unpunished	Bette Davis essayed twin sisters twice . The first was A STOLEN LIFE , one of her last good Warner Brother films in the late 1940s , wherein the good sister watches helplessly while her bad sister steals Glenn Ford from her , but she gets a second chance at Glenn when the bad sister is killed in an accident and the good one can take over her life ( hence the title ) . Then there was this film made nearly two decades later . Despite some far out plot twists , most people think that DEAD RINGER is the better film . By 1964 Davis had discovered ( like her rival Joan Crawford ) that their career could survive playing in " grande guinol " films . WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE ? and HUSH , HUSH SWEET CHARLOTTE , were followed by DEAD RINGER , THE NANNY , and THE ANNIVERSARY ( my personal favorite - and actually the least bloody of these films ) . DEAD RINGER and THE NANNY tie for being the most sympathetic roles for Bette in these films . In DEAD RINGER , Edith Philips is the twin sister of wealthy widow Margaret De Lorca . Edith owns a run - down bar , and it is going into bankruptcy , and she is facing eviction . Her closest friend ( closer if she would watch his signals ) is Police Sgt . Jim Hobbson ( Karl Malden ) . But she is consumed with anger and jealousy at her sister because Margaret married the man who Edith should have married . So Margaret's current security is due to her stealing Edith's boyfriend ( similar to the plot in A STOLEN LIFE ) . So she invites Margaret to her home , and shows Margaret a letter that she has written . It is Edith's suicide note , and as Margaret reads it she realizes that she is about to become Edith permanently . Edith has planned this a bit , but she does not plan for two problems . Sgt . Hobbson is in a bad state because he loved Edith , and he keeps visiting her identical twin " Margaret " . This is upsetting to Edith , who did not plan to hurt her boy-friend . Secondly she discovers Margaret had her secrets too . The late Mr . De Lorca may have died in too timely a fashion ( wink , wink ) , and Margaret had a boy - friend too who helped her , a playboy named Tony Collins . Tony is curious about " Margaret's " lack of interest ( or even awareness ) of him , until he begins to put two and two together , Then he becomes very demanding to his supposed lover . The climax of the film is quite twisty , if predictable after awhile . But the final moment between Davis and Malden is sadly touching in it's way . The film may also have the best dramatic performance by Lawford as a villain in his film career ( finally he cuts loose and shows what he could do ) . Not one of Davis's greatest films , but an interesting one , and worth viewing .
Ah Those Eccentric Egyptologists !	THE GHOUL is one of those films that are rediscovered after being missing for years , and turn out to be worthwhile ( something of a rarity ) . It has a first rate cast of character actors ( including two future knights ) and a good " nest of vipers " plot . And I find it pleasant for bringing in a favorite topic to me : Egyptian archeology and artifacts . Boris Karloff is a dying Egyptologist , who tells his butler Theisinger to make sure a valuable talisman is buried with him . It seems this talisman may guarantee Karloff eternal life according to the ancient Egyptian creed he has come to believe in . Karloff dies , and Theisinger steals the talisman to sell it for a small fortune . But he is soon being pursued by someone - he doesn't know whom . Also he has approached Cedric Hardwicke ( looking a bit like a Dickensian figure in a egg shaped bald wig and thick glasses ) and Hardwicke is just not the type one can trust . Others soon are interested in the talisman , and willing to kill for it . It drags in Anthony Bushell and his girlfriend , and a would-be vamp seeking her " Sheikh-like " mate among the other men in the story . It also brings in Ralph Richardson , as a clergyman who gets involved ( and seemingly disgusted ) at the greedy goings-on he sees . Richardson was at an interesting point in the 1930s . Occasionally he played good guys ( like Robert Donat's ill-fated friend in THE CITADEL ) , but he usually played villains like in BULLDOG JACK or THE SHAPE TO COME or even in THE MAN WHO COULD PERFORM MIRACLES . His Vicar is an interesting character , who really fools us for most of the movie ( and participates in one of the most hair-raising effects in it ) . Because the talisman should be buried with the deceased , but is stolen and sought by all the villains for their own purposes , the title of the film really should have been " THE GHOULS " , because ghouls were grave robbers . Instead , the public who saw the film see Karloff resurrected and chasing after the stolen item that is needed for his final eternal rest - and thought that Boris is the titled monster . He is a danger to the other characters , but most of them deserve it . His final act of faith is a grim , and visible one . When it is over one hopes his character did achieve eternal peace . How realistic is this view of Egyptological eccentrics , and the theft of antiquities ? Well , read the papers these days , and see how so many museums in the U . S . ( including the Metropolitan and the Getty ) are returning stolen antiquities to Italy , Egypt , Latin America . The market for such thefts is still there - just look at how they have tried to save the Iraqi museums of valuable Sumerian , Assyrian , and Babylonian tablets and statuary . As for the picture of an Egyptologist going so far off the road as to worship Amon or Ra or Thoth or whoever , if one looks at the initial archaeologists and specialist in Egypt , one finds many eccentrics . Some have weird backgrounds . The fabled Egyptian antiquities collection at the Brooklyn Museum was collected in the late 19th Century by Charles Wilbour , who spent the last thirty years of his life living on a houseboat on the Nile collecting . Wilbour had an interesting life before 1871 . He had been the translator of the novels of Victor Hugo into English . He also ran a prosperous printing business in Brooklyn and New York City . It was that , you may say , that led to his relocating in Egypt . Wilbour made a fortune working hand in glove with Boss William Magear Tweed and Tammany Hall in inflating the cost of paper sales to the city of New York . He decided to leave when the Boss fell from power . New York's loss turned out to be the Brooklyn Museum's gain .
A Look at Paranoia Shattering Trust	I finally was able to see this entire film today . Based on a modern best seller from Japan it has been seen as a critique of Japanese society , the modern U . S . " empire " , and fascism . One can see the military hardware and trained soldiers around remind one of the modern American Army , but that's about it ( as far as I can see ) . The treatment of the high schoolers and the burned out depressed state of Japan ( with the militarism ) can be a commentary on the collapse of capitalism or the rise of dictatorships , but the use of the name " the East Asian Republic " seems a dig at the old Imperialist Japanese dream of a " Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere " in the 1920s-1940s . But it is more modern - note the Japan after the economic crash is a Republic . BATORU ROWAIARU ( better known abroad as BATTLE ROYALE ) is about a future Japan that is a dictatorship , and is deadly afraid of the threat of youth . A law has been passed to run a yearly contest where a high school class is chosen by lottery . It's students are put on an island , and ordered ( by threat of death ) to fight each other to the death until either one or none are left . The threat of death is a real one . When their former teacher is telling them that this is serious , he has trouble with a female and a male student . He throws a knife into the female students skull , and demonstrates on the male student that the metal collars put on the students ' necks happens to be rigged to explode if they tamper with them or try to remove them . What happens , of course , is that the students soon are at each other's throats ( with a few notable exceptions ) . It somewhat reminiscent here of LORD OF THE FLIES , with warfare breaking out between two groups , but here it is everyone for themselves . Occasionally we see the teacher and the military at the high school headquarters on the island , but most of the time we don't see the adults ( with one exception ) . The three students who cooperate are Noriko , Shuya , and Kawada . Shuya was a friend of the student who was used to demonstrate the explosive qualities of those collars , and he feels guilty that he could not help his friend when he was screaming for assistance . Noriko was the girlfriend of the same fellow . The two end up promising to protect each other , and are eventually allied with Kawada , a survival expert who was one of two transfer students to their class . While other students try to cooperate , they meet with various degrees of fortune ( mostly bad ) . As for the adults , the only one we get to know is their teacher , who is an unsuccessful parent and a hateful teacher Kitano ( one of the male students stabs him at the start of the film , prior to the scene shifting to the island ) . The teacher happens to like Noriko , who is a sweet girl and reminds the teacher of the kind of child he would have liked to have had rather than what he does ( his own daughter tells him over the phone that his breath stinks even over the phone ) . To many people viewing the film it seems like a war between age groups ( vigorous , hopeful , democratic youth vs . fearful grown-ups ) . It is , but to see it only that way misses some points . The game or test is to purposely shatter the unanimity of the students , and it is not as hard as one would think . It has been said that the cruelest of human beings are children , and this film shows that is true . The girls have social cliques , and they constantly turn against outsiders . These frictions pop up in one-on-one confrontations , and also in a massive massacre sequence in a lighthouse , supposedly between girls who were friends . In the latter situation , when one of the more sensible girls tries to calm things down , one of her supposed friends tells her to knock off the leadership crap . As for the boys , a trio do work together to save as many as possible by some computer hacking and weapons building , but their work is smashed by the most frightening figure in the film , a second transfer student who enjoys killing people . The results are a thoughtful film , and a basically sad one . Unlike the rescue of the boys in LORD OF THE FLIES the bulk of the students die here . I won't say if any survive . But the same result of this film was done in a TWILIGHT ZONE episode dealing with a power failure in a neighborhood - it only took Rod Serling 30 minutes rather than two hours to do that . I actually like BATTLE ROYALE ( the acting and directing is good , and the scenery fine ) . But the message could have been given to us in a faster manner .
Barrymore's Wonderful Life - But as " George Bailey " not " Potter "	This was the third of the rediscovered films that Meriam Cooper had taken out of circulation in a business deal with RKO back in the 1940s , that Turner Classic Movies showed on Wednesday , April 4 , 2006 . Of the three it is the best , mostly due to a strong story about a country doctor over the years who discovers in the end that he was not the failure he felt he was , but that he gained the love and respect of the people of his town and of highly regarded medical specialists in New York City . Lionel Barrymore was the first of the famous trio of siblings to gain an Academy Award ( for A FREE SOUL in 1930 - 31 ) wherein he gave a terrific performance as a hard drinking criminal attorney who pulls himself together to save his daughter ( Norma Shearer ) from the gallows . His character in that screenplay had been based on the celebrated California attorney Earl Rogers , father of screenwriter Adele Rogers St . John . It remains one of the best of the early male Oscars . And he would fill the screen with other performances , frequently of crusty old gents with plenty of wisdom , in films like CAPTAIN'S COURAGEOUS and ON BORROWED TIME and YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU . All too frequently his detractors note a hammy tendency that got into his acting , it's true , but even when he is hammy Lionel can produce interest in whatever he's doing on stage or screen . Here he is Eli Watt , a doctor who is returning to his native town with his six year old son Jimmy in tow . He tells the local banker ( Oscar Apfel ) that he could not make a real go of it in the big city , so he felt he should set up practice back in his home town . After getting a smaller mortgage than he would like ( ironically he asks if the ink in his pen that he needs to sign the mortgage is free ! ) he sets up shop . Soon he is having his first customer . David Landau ( the President of Darwin College in HORSE FEATHERS ) is a farmer whose wife is pregnant . They don't have money , but can pay Watt in two bushels of potatoes . Watt ( taking his son along ) goes to Landau's farm . Unfortunately , while he saves the baby daughter that the wife gave birth to , complications killed the wife . A bitter Landau refuses to listen to Barrymore's attempts to get him to accept the little girl , and throws Barrymore , the baby and Barrymore's medical bag out . The little girl is named Lettie by Barrymore . With the assistance of a housekeeper / old friend named Sarah ( May Robson , in a typically great performance ) , Barrymore raises Lettie with his own son . However , four years later a reformed and penitent Landau returns , and convinces Barrymore to let him raise daughter again . As it turns out Landau really does reform , and Lettie grows up ( as Dorothy Jordan ) to be a decent person . The film actually follows the odd situation Barrymore faces in the small town . He is the man the locals all go to for medical advice , and he is willing to take produce for it ( much to the amazement of Apfel , who has to keep giving extensions on that mortgage to Barrymore as a result ) . We also see Jimmie grow into Joel Mcrae , and assist his father , until he is ready to study medicine too for a career as a doctor . Barrymore's moments of glory are mostly quiet ones . In the 1930s it was more common for doctors to do " house calls " than today - unfortunately - and Barrymore is seen going in all kinds of weather , even being upset in a sled ( by the snow ) on a call . Then he successfully fights a small pox epidemic among the poorer farmers when the local county medical group are busy with a typhoid epidemic . His success there is the first time his activities gain state wide attention . Lettie assists in the small pox epidemic , and later she and her boyfriend Bill ( James Rush ) are in a car accident , that Barrymore again shows himself at his best in . He saves Bill's broken arm by fast emergency service , before Bill is taken to New York for final surgery . Mcrae is one of the surgeons with Barrymore in this event , and a leading New York specialist ( Hale Hamilton ) suggests that Barrymore could still make a first rate career in the city's leading research complex . And here is the interesting point of the film - wherein I will cease further comments on the plot in specifics , except to say Barrymore does have his day of glory . It seems that the plot of this film looks ( remarkably so ) like IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE . I realize that IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE was supposed to be based on a story by Philip Van Doren Stern called " THE GREATEST GIFT " . But the whole spirit of that film is that George Bailey wants to leave Bedford Falls and win his fortune outside in the great world . Every time he is about to do so he is prevented by the death of his father ( oddly enough Samuel Hinds , who appears in a small role in this film ) , or by the actions of Potter , or the timidity and selfishness of the townspeople . The same thing happens here to Dr . Watt . He is in the position to leave , and comes close once to do so , but the illness of a friend prevents him . He never has his chance to show what he can do . Of course , Watt ( like George Bailey ) does discover he was a great success because he helped his neighbors despite everything ( as George did in the later film ) . But isn't it really ironic that the hero in this film is played by Lionel Barrymore , who was the devil incarnate villain Potter in the later film ?
America's Favorite Foreign Revolution ?	The history of Mexico , our southern neighbor ( and sometimes victim ) is better known to American movie goers than the history of most countries . You begin with the Maya ( KINGS OF THE SUN ) , the conquest of Mexico ( THE CAPTAIN FROM CASTILE ) , then to the founding of Father Serra's missions in California ( SEVEN CITIES OF GOLD ) , and then the Spanish in the southwest and California ( THE MARK OF ZORRO ) . Mexican - American history begins with the Texas War for Independence ( THE ALAMO , THE LAST TEXAN , etc . ) . We skip to the French " intervention " : JUAREZ and VERA CRUZ . Then we tend to skip the long reign of Porfirio Diaz . Then comes the Mexican Revolution . The number of films that deal with the revolution is vast . But here are just a few titles : VIVA ZAPATA , VIVA VILLA , VILLA RIDES , THE OLD GRINGO ( about Ambrose Bierce's probable death in Mexico's revolution ) , VIVA MARIA ( a spoof but it touches on some issues ) , THE THREE AMIGOS , THEY CAME TO CORDURA ( regarding the American Intervention under General Pershing in 1916 ) , THE FUGITIVE ( dealing with the anti-Catholic policies of the 1920s and 1930s ) , and even THE TREASURE OF SIERRA MADRES ( when you see the business with Alfonso Badoya's bandit gang against the Federales ) . The Mexican Revolution had many heroes . Many were heroes for one group but devils to another . Madero and Carranza stressed the need to have a nation that was loyal to a written constitution . Zapata would be one of the leaders of the land reform movement . Starting with Francisco Madero , going through Pancho Villa and Eufremio Zapata , going to their enemy Venusiano Carranza , to Obregon , Calles , and the great land reformer Lazaro Cardenas - the leadership was varied . The largest concentration of films is on the colorful ( and murderous ) Villa ( a recent cable television movie was about Villa and his contract with D . W . Griffith to shoot a movie , AND STARRING PANCHO VILLA ) . But historians usually feel that while Villa tended to be on the side of the peasants , he had too much of the bandit in him to be a leader of the revolution's reforms . Zapata , on the other hand actually tried to reform the division of land . His work never got as far as he wanted before he was assassinated , but it was burned into the souls of the people from his region of Mexico ( who still call themselves Zapatistas when involved in political protests to this day ) , and it did help set the stage for Cardenas ' reforms in the late 1930s . With direction by Elia Kazan and screenplay by John Steinbeck , VIVA ZAPATA is a wonderful , if simplistic view of the Revolution for American audiences . Brando underplays the lead for the most part - Zapata was not an explosive personality like Villa . Anthony Quinn is the explosive brother , whose more selfish attitudes leads to his own disaster . Of the supporting players , Alan Reed is good in his scene as Villa , where he discusses the future of Mexico with Zapata . Joseph Wiseman is properly sinister as an constant malcontent agent provocateur , insinuating each leader is too weak or unreliable to lead . There are great set pieces - like Kazan's symbolic assassination of Madero by General Huerta's goons who drown out the little reformer / orator's voice as he tries to scream with a siren ( but it makes the screams of the unheard martyr like a clarion call to Mexico ) . Is it real Mexican history ? Not quite - it is a version of it . But it is a really well done version of it .
Nifty little comedy thriller	Somehow , when thinking of movie couples in the golden age of film , Carole Lombard's partnership with Fred MacMurray gets overlooked . Not as glamorous as Tracy and Hepburn , Hepburn and Grant , Grant and Dunne , Eddy and MacDonald , MacDonald and Chevalier , Bogart and Bacall , it still got tremendous mileage in comedies ( HANDS ACROSS THE TABLE , TRUE CONFESSIONS ) , comic thrillers ( THE PRINCESS COMES ACROSS ) , and straight drama ( SWING HIGH , SWING LOW ) . Lombard had the ability to make the film's activities soar by her zaniness . MacMurray managed to anchor the film down by his normality ( and in TRUE CONFESSIONS uses this normality against itself - by taking himself too seriously ) . THE PRINCESS COMES ACROSS made fun of thrillers ( although the dangers involved are not made funny ) , and of the culture of publicity that the public thrives on . Lombard has the looks and talents to make it in movies , but nobody cares . With the help of Alison Skipworth she pretends she is Princess Olga of Sweden and she wants to act in movies . Besides the spoofing of Garbo , Lombard is counting on the vast publicity from the media to get her the million dollar contract she wants . Oddly enough , the Swedish royal family does not seem to care that a fraud is being perpetrated by Lombard and Skipworth at their expense . But we have to make some concession to the plot . MacMurray is a well known musician ( a concertina player of all things ) and orchestra leader . He and his manager pal , William Frawley , are on the boat as well , and MacMurray is very interested in the beautiful , but snobbish Princess . However , he has another problem . MacMurray is an honest fellow , but he did one bad thing , and he is being pursued by an obnoxious little weasel ( played superbly by Porter Hall ) who is waiting for a big payoff from the musician . He also seems to know the truth about the Princess . MacMurray refuses to pay , and Hall promises him some problems . The ship has several internationally known detectives on board ( among them are Mischa Auer , Sig Ruman , and Douglas Dumbrille ) , and Hall sees one of the detectives and we see him approach to talk to him . Shortly afterward Hall is found murdered . On top of this , there is word ( sent to the ship ) that an escaped murderer is thought to be aboard ( shades of Dr . Crippen ) , and we do see a strange little stowaway from time to time . The film goes on to a second murder , a set of different rival detectives trying to solve the case , and MacMurray deciding to step in to clear himself and the Princess . The conclusion is quiet satisfactory . With it's cast of expert character actors supporting MacMurray and Lombard's performances , and the clever script , THE PRINCESS COMES ACROSS is a first rate comic thriller . I rate it .
The Height of Racial Realism in 1934	One can make a case that this film about the African - American racial realities of the New Deal period is the equivalent of " House Of Rothschild " , a contemporary movie regarding Jews and anti-Semitism . Both movies are very well-intentioned for their day , but are somewhat appalling for the present day . " House Of Rothschild " had great performances by George Arliss as Nathan Rothschild , and Boris Karloff as his German foe , the bigoted Baron Ledranz . But it suggested that the key to the emancipation of the Jews ( and their acceptance by gentile society ) was tied to economic success and power . This ignored the roots of anti-Semitism in economic jealousy by non-Jews . In " Imitation Of Life " , we see two poor single mothers , one white and one black , each with a daughter , who form a partnership that enriches them with an " Aunt Jemimah " baking empire . But in the real world , how frequently did white and black people cooperate that closely when millions of dollars were at stake ? The ideas , however , of this film are not easy to reject totally . Forgetting the idea of inter-racial economic cooperation and money making , the idea that a white and a black woman could become close is not totally impossible , and the issues of the problems both women have with their daughters are still relevant . Claudette Colbert ( Bea Pullman ) and her daughter Rochelle Hudson ( Jessie ) find that they become rivals for Warren Williams ( Steve Archer ) . The rivalry of the pair for the same man is not uncommon , and the sad resolution of the problem seems unfair to Bea . Wisely the script does not settle what the future will prove about this collision of sexual hopes . No such problem faces Louise Beavers ( Delilah Johnson ) and Freddie Washington ( Peola ) . Beavers is a hard working , decent woman who is fully aware of what the average White person expects of a Black person's " attitudes " in the America ( or Western World ) of 1934 . Subserviance is the key for survival . Beavers , in the story , is luckier than most of her people because she has made a large amount of money as Colbert's business partner . But she can only get so far with that advantage - she can't live in a mansion and hobnob with the social elite . But she doesn't really seem to care to . The old ( and infuriating ) phrase about " knowing her place " is acceptable to her . But Peola is light skinned , and can pass herself off as white . She desperately wants to do so - to " sneak " ( for want of a better term ) herself into the majority of the population , with all the attending economic , political , and social advantages . And Bea wants Peola to accept her racial difference . Today , of course , we feel that it is the sin of the society penalizing millions of non-whites that is the terrible wrong , not Peola's desperate attempt to grab at happiness . But in 1934 it was Peola who was found to be wrong . Her selfishness leads to killing the saintly , decent Delilah , and Peola realizes this at the conclusion - at her mother's funeral . Before leaving this I have to point out that Peola's gamble probably would have been difficult in the long run . In the 1920s , New York society was shocked and titillated by the Kip Rhinelander Divorce Scandal . The son of a wealthy old New York family , Rhinelander married a very attractive woman . Then their child turned out to be African-American . The resulting divorce action was very ugly . If Peola married a white man , she would run a similar risk ( as would all " white " descendants of the couple ) due to genetics . Oddly enough , this particular situation is not a dated story theme . On an episode of LAW AND ORDER about six years ago , the murder of a woman was tied to her trying to regain her son by her ex-husband : the husband ( like Peola ) could pass himself off as white , and was a high ranking business executive with a new wife , who was white , and also a bigot . Among other things to note in this film is the use of the " Aunt Jemimah " clone in 1934 - a key to the long term success of that brand with the American public ( and one that still exists ) , and the business deal that Ned Sparks and Colbert are negotiation with a clone of General Mills or some other food conglomerate . The funeral of Delilah also is notable , for the appearance of members of the Black Middle class in the scenes , in particular the men in quasi-military uniforms who must belong to some " mason " like club , and who give the deceased a goodbye beneath their outstretched military sabers . The appearance of Preston Sturges as one of the screenplay writers suggests some of the touches - Sturges liked to poke fun at well known brand names . In " Christmas In July " , for instance , the coffee company is Maxford's ( like Maxwell House ) . I find this a well acted and thoughtful movie for 1934 , and yes , Louise Beavers did give her most tragic performance in this film . But the acceptance of racial inequalities that really are not acceptable anymore ( although much improvement is still needed ) does stick in one's craw .
Hitchcock's remake of 1956 : What Will Be Will Be	THE original film of THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH was made in 1934 , and was about a bunch of foreign agents ( led by Peter Lorre ) who kidnap a little girl to force her parents to keep their mouths shut about an assassination plot they are planning at London's Albert Hall . Hitchcock took this story to develop his memories of an incident in 1911 , the Siege of Sidney Street , where a set of police killing anarchists ( actually Russian revolutionaries ) fought a pitch battle against army forces sent by Home Secretary Winston Churchill until artillery set their building on fire , and they were all killed . The original film was not a great one , but it was well directed and acted , and is still entertaining . But it bothered Hitch . He felt that the sequence leading to the assassination attempt at Albert Hall was not very well handled in the first film . Indeed , if you compare the two films the assassination is markedly different and more dramatic in the 1956 remake than in the original . In the original , the assassin is seen setting himself up in the Hall , to fire his gun at a given moment ( when two cymbals crash ) . When Edna Best sees him about to fire she screams , but we do not see what happened . We see Lorre and his co-conspirators listening to the concert on the radio , and hearing the scream , a shot and consternation from the audience . Then the assassin returns , shame-faced . We are also allowed a sight of the dignitary being attended to while unconscious and wounded . The build up at the Albert Hall is more complex , with Hitchcock concentrating on the confusion of Doris Day ( after the assassin reminds her of her child's fate ) , and the music ( by Bernard Herrmann ) building to the crescendo - we are even shown the turning of the page leading to the musical passage . The dignitary was a bearded old fogy in the first film . Here Hitch got a bald , plump man who looked very innocent to the viewer . And when the unstrung Day screams , it causes the assassin to misfire , and the dignitary to turn ( he is shot in his arm as a result ) . The assassin tries to escape , but while tussling with a policeman in the opera box , he topples over to his death . It's one of many differences in the two films . There is no siege of Sidney Street now , but a final confrontation in the embassy of the country the dignitary rules ( it is not a grubby bunch of conspirators , but people working for a conspiracy to kill their Premier ) . The ambassador is involved in the plot . The first murder is not at a party in Switzerland ( as in the 1934 film ) but at a street bazaar in Marraketch , with the person who tells Jimmy Stewart the assassination plot disguised as a native ( why ? ) . Hitchcock was working with big budgets in the middle and late 1950s he could only dream of in the 1930s . Instead of using many small models and sets , he could shoot on location - and colorful ones . He could also use superstars in his films ( not just well known figures in British and Continental pictures like Leslie Banks and Pierre Fresney , and Lorre ) like Stewart and Day . Interestingly enough the rest of the cast is not as sparkling ( it is not like Grant - Saint - and Mason in NORTH BY NORTHWEST ) , but it is highly competent . Bernard Miles ( later Lord Miles ) was best recalled as Newman Noggs , the clerk who assists the hero in NICHOLAS NICKLEBY ( 1946 ) . Here he plays an ultimately sinister part . Brenda De Banzie is best recalled as Charles Laughton's capable daughter who marries John Mills in HOBSON'S CHOICE . She is Miles ' wife , and the troubled conscience in the kidnap plot . The films's suspense and color make it much more entertaining than the original , and it becomes the only Hitchcock film to produce a song hit : " Que Sera , Sera ! " Doris Day made the most of that little tune , which becomes a key to the resolution of the film's plot . It is not the greatest Hitchcock film , but it is certainly one of the finest he created .
A Charming Film about Family Life in Quebec	I saw this film only once forty years ago , but I really enjoyed it . Charles Boyer is the head of a Quebecois family who has to face normal problems of his son's growing up , his brothers ( Kurt Kazner and Louis Jourdan ) and their problems . It was very heart warming . An example of this is towards the end when Boyer's son ( Bobby Driscoll ) has been somewhat framed by a rival at his school , and has been humiliated and punished by an unreasonable , martinet teacher ( corporal punishment is allowed in Quebec in the 1920s , when the story occurs , and the teacher used a switch on Driscoll ) . Boyer goes to see the teacher , and discovers that the latter has made a mistake that can be misconstrued as illegal behavior . When Driscoll was whipped the teacher had insisted on him telling the truth . Grabbing the switch , Boyer starts demanding the truth from the teacher now . It was quite an enjoyable moment . The film was later turned into a Broadway musical also called THE HAPPY TIME , starring Robert Goelet . Occasionally the theme song of that show is revived ( usually Goelet's recording of it ) on radio .
The name's Willoughby , Ward Willoughby . . .	Although two of the " Thin Man " films , and " I Love You Again " usually have their fans as the best Powell-Loy romp , this one is in that select bunch . Powell never did another film with a drag scene in it - and what a scene ( his fake breast slowly collapses when it is snared on a record player ) . The scenes with psychiatrists Vladimir Sokoloff and Sig Ruman are funny too , as are the various confrontations with mother-in-law Florence Bates ( notice that business about the unwanted rug she gave them ) , and . . . best of all . . . the other man in the plot - Jack Carson who is always ready to explain he is Ward Willoughby ( one wonders if Rod Sterling watched this and Willoughby's eventual fate , when he created the " Twilight Zone " episode about the town of that name ) . I found this an absolute scream , and recommend it highly .
Shaw's One Academy Award	George Bernard Shaw was very wary about allowing his movies to be filmed . He had seen movies by other famous writers and dramatists thoroughly rewritten for the screen , and thoroughly wrecked as a result . So the greatest English speaking dramatist of the 20th Century held off from any involvement with motion pictures into the 1930s . Then he met Gabriel Pascal . Mr . Pascal was thoroughly honest . He admitted he did not have a cent to his name , but he also admitted a desire to produce all of Shaw's major plays as movies exactly as Shaw wanted them shown . Shaw was impressed and made an agreement giving Pascal a monopoly on all his plays for movie making . In return , Shaw was to be involved in the productions . It turned out to be a remarkably small but fruitful partnership . Of the over fifty plays of Shaw's output ( not to mention several novels ) , only four were produced by Pascal . They are PYGMALION ( 1938 ) , MAJOR BARBARA ( 1940 ) , CAESAR AND CLEOPATRA ( 1945 ) , and ANDROCLES AND THE LION ( 1952 ) . They are all good films , and the first three have reason to be considered great . Shaw died in 1950 , so he was not there to see ( after Pascal's death ) the decline in standards of films based on his plays - such as Otto Preminger's brave attempt at ST . JOAN , and the wretched THE MILLIONAIRESS with Peter Sellers and Sophia Loren . PYGMALION was a good choice for the first of the series , probably as it was the most popular comedy by Shaw . It was also one of the most controversial plays because of the problem that bedeviled the original production of 1914 and has effected it ever since : how is it supposed to end ? Will Higgins and Eliza put aside their differences and admit they love each other and come together at the end ? Shaw clearly felt that Pygmalion Higgins and Galatea Doolittle were doomed not to end in an embrace . He wanted the audience to be left thinking of Eliza as one of the 20th Century's " New Women " , who is independent and strong , not just a piece of weak clay to be kneaded by an artistic and overpowering male ego . In the dialog ( which he uses in the play and in the movie script ) Shaw insisted that Eliza favors Freddy Eynesford-Hill over Higgins because Freddy is a weakling . All her life she has been dominated by strong men ( first her father Alfred , then Higgins , and ( although he is kinder ) Col . Pickering ) . Freddy is the first one to show his need for guidance and help - he is shown at the beginning of the play as little better than a servant for his mother and sister , getting them a cab in the rain . But Shaw did not have an easy time with this view . The play was produced by Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree , one of England's leading stars of the Edwardian and Georgian stage ( he was brother of critic and writer Sir Max Beerbohm , and his son David Tree plays Freddy in this film version ) . Beerbohm Tree felt that there was a real romance between Higgins and Doolittle , and insisted on playing it like that , to the point of throwing a bouquet of flowers to Eliza as she is leaving . Shaw was furious at this , and wrote a seven page afterword which ( mercifully ) is never read at productions . I saw Peter O'Toole as Higgins in 1988 , with Amanda Plummer as Eliza , Lionel Jeffries as Pickering , and the late Sir John Mills as Alfred Doolittle , and the play ended on the right note of uncertainty wanted . It did not have a thin , bearded actor as Shaw coming out to read the afterward . In this afterward , Shaw said that Eliza learns from the brutal Higgins he is a confirmed bachelor devoted to his mother ( an interesting psychological point there that another play could have been built from ) . She does marry Freddy , and ( as Higgins had sneered ) things are tough - though not due to Freddy being unfaithful but that he is not very sharp . But Col . Pickering helps them set up a florist business , and after awhile it prospers . Clara Eynesford-Hill ( whose character is barely developed in the play or on the screen ) does become a friend of the socialist and novelist H . G . Wells . Alfred Doolittle , after getting speech lessons from Higgins , becomes a popular speaker and writer on social issues . As you can see , Shaw's anger got the better of him . Shaw was convinced by Pascal ( for business reasons ) to soften the conclusion , by showing Eliza fleeing Higgins in Freddy's car , Higgins walking alone through London to his home , slamming the door of his study , causing the phonograph to go on , playing a record of Eliza's old voice talking . As he sits with head in his hands , Eliza shows up at the door , turns off the machine , and starts talking as on the record . But Higgins realizes it is her , although he does not turn around . He sits back with a happy , if smug expression on his face , pulls his hat down over his eyes , and says ( shot from his back to Eliza ) , " Where the devil are my slippers , Eliza ? " It is suggestive of a meeting of two souls , but it leaves it still in the air . It is superior to that idiotic afterward . George Bernard Shaw won his only Oscar for a screenplay for PYGMALION . It is a brilliant play and script , given top notched direction by Anthony Asquith and Leslie Howard , with Howard giving one of his three top performances in it as Higgins - ably matched by Wendy Hiller as Eliza and Wilfred Lawson as Doolittle . And it's conclusion was so good , it was kept by Learner and Lowe for MY FAIR LADY on stage and screen .
Entering the Twilight Zone in the Dead of Night	This was one of those episodes of THE TWILIGHT ZONE that were shown on Friday , July 4th on the Science Fiction Station . The episode dealt with a classic horror tale that keeps going around the world as urban myth , and will probably still be doing so 100 years from now , along with the alligators in our urban sewers . Barbara Nichols is Liz Powers , a successful nightclub dancer-performer , whose agent Barney ( Fredd Wayne ) has just signed her up for a nice new gig in Miami . But she is suffering from overwork , and needs bed rest . While in the hospital she starts having a recurring nightmare where she is aware that it is dark as night , but the clock reads 8 : 10 P . M . She hears nothing . She reaches for a glass of water and it falls and breaks . No nurse comes in so she goes out to investigate . She sees a nurse all the way down the hall going into a room . She follows and finds it is the hospital morgue . The nurse ( Arlene Martel ) reappears and faces her with an attractive but sinister face . " Room for one more honey ? " , she says . Nichols feeling she is confronting great evil lets out a piercing scream , and the next thing she knows she is being held down by another nurse and the hospital doctor ( Jonathan Harris ) on her bed . This happens three nights in a row . Harris tries to reassure Nichols that there is no reason for her to have this fear - he shows her the night nurse ( Norma Connelly ) , who does not look at all like the figure in the dream . Nichols really is not convinced , and finds that her agent is not really good in helping her feel any sense of relief either . Then Harris suggests something to Nichols . In all three of her dreams the pattern remained the same - vary it : Don't reach for the glass of water . Nichols , still dubious , goes to bed , and again , at 8 : 10 P . M . she wakes . She almost reaches for the glass , but remembers what Harris suggested . Instead she decides to smoke a cigarette instead . But in putting the lighter down on the table , she knocks over the glass again . She decides to see if her varying the situation has any effect . She walks down the hall , and again the entire dream plays out with the sinister nurse . She is seen screaming as Harris gives her a sedative injection . But in the course of her screaming she does say something that Harris is puzzled about . She mentions " 22 " , and Harris knows of a Room 22 that the patients never see . SPOILER COMING UP : Nichols leaves the next day . She is looking forward to the Miami gig . She reaches the airport and is given her ticket , and then learns that she is booked on flight 22 . This is unsettling , as is the fact she notices the time is now 8 : 10 P . M . She walks somewhat unsteadily and knocks into a woman carrying a vase with flowers , which she causes to fall and break . Suddenly Nichols is really getting frightened , as key events of that dream seem to be reoccurring in a different setting . An airport employee points out that her plane is getting ready to leave . Nichols stumbles down to the ramp up to the plane's entrance , and a stewardess is there - it is Martel , and smiling the same way she asks , " Room for one more honey ? " Nichols screams and runs down the ramp and back to the main building of the airport . A moment later the plane bursts into flames before a horrified Nichols and the others in the building . TWENTY TWO was one of six TWILIGHT ZONE episodes that were shot on video tape , and it certainly adds an " odd dimension " to the viewing pleasure of it . Because of the fuzzy quality of the episode's appearance it makes the turmoil of Nichols ' apparent mental breakdown more effective . But it also reminds us of the live television that was so much a part of the 1950s , and of which so much is now lost or missing . In particular watching Nichols deepening fears get realized , and the growing uncertainty of the intelligent skeptical Harris , we are lucky to see them almost as if they were freshly performing in front of us . Wayne too is good as a nice fellow who really can't make out what is going on with his client and friend , but blunderingly keeps trying to move on . And Martel does the most with her limited appearances in the episode . The episode was based on an anecdote that Bennett Cerf put into one of his anthologies . But it may seem familiar to viewers of the film DEAD OF NIGHT , when in the first episode of the film a racing car driver is recovering in a hospital and has a recurring nightmare where he awakes at a given time , looks out the window and sees a hearse driven by Miles Mander dressed as an undertaker , who looks up at the patient and says , " Only room for one more , Sir ! " In the end the racer , after he leaves the hospital , almost boards a double decker bus and sees the conductor is Mander , repeating , " Only room for one more , Sir ! " . Wisely he does not board , and watches in horror as the bus ( in avoiding a collision ) falls off a bridge . I have seen the anecdote appear in collections of " odd but true " books frequently . I don't care if it is really a false story - it is a damned good one .
First rate musical despite the music - Great history lesson too	Despite a few historical errors ( one of which I will mention ) , 1776 is one of the best historical presentations on screen of the events leading to the creation of an important historical moment : the decision of the Continental Congress to go for American Independence by signing the Declaration of Independence . The film is based on the Broadway musical in which William Daniels and Howard Da Silva had starred . The musical ( Broadway show and movie ) both concentrated on John Adams , the Massachusetts lawyer and delegate to the Congress ( who eventually became an important diplomat , our first Vice President , and our Second President ) . Adams was a brilliant man , but blunt and insulting to get his points across . Like his cousin Sam ( who is not a character in the musical , unfortunately , but was one of the most skillful rebel instigators of all times ) John happened to be a realist . He had defended the British soldiers in the Boston Massacre , but he was a patriot who had seen what was going on in Massachusetts since 1765 , and he was unimpressed by ideas of the restoration of colonial relations between the 13 colonies and England . Adams worked to get an edge in against the moderates ( led by John Dickinson of Pennsylvania ) who were mostly large property owners and felt the Empire was too great an institution to be thrown away cavalierly . Dickinson had little use for Adams or Massachusetts ( he felt that was the only trouble-making colony and that Adams was impossibly rude - certainly not a gentleman ) . But Adams found allies - Dickenson's rival in Pennsylvania Ben Franklin , Virginia's Richard Henry Lee and Thomas Jefferson , and Delaware's Caesar Rodney . But even with these allies , could he build the consensus that he needed to get independence ? Through the musical numbers the main problems Adams faces are brought to the attention of the audience . He is lonely - he misses Abigail ( his wife , Virginia Vestoff ) and they have several duets based on their letters ( she wants him to come home too ) . Jefferson can't work without seeing his wife Martha , and Adams sends for her ( much to Abigail's annoyance - why not her ? ) . The South does not like any suggestion that slavery has been forced on them by English trade methods , and that the institution is wrong . The final outcome of all the negotiation and compromise ( some of which infuriates Adams ) comes down to a single man who disappoints Dickinson . Adams is played by William Daniels , who had the best role in his career and was lucky enough to duplicate it on film . A man of dry and slight appearance ( perhaps perennially looking unhappy ) Daniels fits the role of the dour , pessimistic , but witty Adams . Howard Da Silva is perfect as Franklin - charming and clever , and devilish in the conclusion in explaining why Adams must give in on the slavery question . Ken Howard is appealing as the idealistic , young Jefferson - who shows a sly liking for Adams that will build to a famous friendship ( only disrupted by party politics for ten years on the 1790s ) . He and Blythe Danner are cute as the young couple ( they were just married in 1773 ) . Danner has one of the best tunes in the show - " He plays the violin " - which deals with her affection for Tom ( listen to the melody carefully , the last verse has a degree of foreboding about her early death in 1782 ) . Howard , Da Silva , and Daniels have a funny song , " The Egg " , about the birth of the United States , especially regarding the national bird ( Franklin keeps pushing the turkey because it is a feisty bird and delicious ) . And note the song by the young soldier , " Mother , Look Sharp " which is ultimately tragic and chilling about death on the battlefield . As Dickinson , Donald Madden is a fine foe to Adams - and ultimately an honorable patriot ( despite his desire for keeping the British Empire together , he will join the army to protect his country ) . And John Cullum has the best song ( my opinion ) in the show - " Molassas to Rum to Slaves " where he describes the hypocrisy of the North about slavery by showing the triangle trade that enriched New England . My only problem deals with one character - Judge James Wilson . He is the final key to Adams winning on independence , and is shown as an insecure figure who seeks anonymity . Wilson was no mediocrity , but a skillful legal mind who would play important roles in the creation of the U . S . Constitution and in the formative years of the U . S . Supreme Court ( of which he was an Associate Justice ) . But aside from that the film is wonderful , and good entertainment for Independence Day . Postscript : / 2008 - Turner Classics showed the film last night as part of the Fourth of July Celebration . Apparently there is additional dialog that is useful in the film , and a nice additional song , " Cool Conservative Men " sung by Dickenson and Rutledge . If you want to get this film make sure to get the complete version of it .
The One With the Two Cigarettes Lit by the Man at the Same Time	This may be the best soap opera love film from Hollywood in it's golden age - it certainly is among them , and it certainly is Bette Davis ' best soap opera role : Charlotte Vale . From neurotic , overweight recluse to sophisticated traveler , to surrogate mother of the daughter of the man she loves but can't have . It is 1942 , and divorce is still a sticky matter . Davis always denied that , eventually , her character and Jerry Durrance ( Paul Henried ) would have married ( presumably when his daughter Tina would grow up ) . She insisted that she and Dr . Jacquith ( Claude Rains ) would have married . If so it would probably been a friendly marriage - not a sexually based one . I suppose her guess was based on her involvement with Jacquith's country rest home ( they are planning a whole new wing she's financing at the end of the film ) . Certainly she is getting involved , and Jacquith does look at her in a slightly different way just before the end of the film . But Jacquith has never even shown anything but a doctor's interest in Charlotte in the film - it has blossomed into a friendship though . The film has many lovely moments in it - some quite funny actually . The car wreck in Brazil with Giuseppi , the taxi driver who barely speaks English ( " Banana trees " is one of his phrases ) is amusing . Even the autocratic Mrs . Vale ( Dame Gladys Cooper ) makes some cracks that are funny ( her comparison of people to flowers for example ) . Cooper's autocratic old line female Brahman is a wonderful acting job , nearly stealing the movie from Davis and Rains at times . It earned her an Oscar nomination . And Bonita Granville certainly does a nice job as Charlotte's niece , who likes to tease her ( apparently a family habit ) , but eventually realizes that Charlotte is as normal as she is . Any film with a title based on a Walt Whitman quote must be good . If you have never seen this one , see it soon .
What is the Value of the Modern Beauty Contest ?	A very funny film , with a first rate cast , MISS CONGENIALITY deals with examining the value of an American institution . When I was growing up one of the yearly television events I always recalled was the " Miss America " pageant ( as well as the other beauty pageant for " Miss Universe " ) . Watching Bert Parks ' singing the " Miss America " song was on the same level as watching the Thanksgiving Day parade or the Superbowl . In fact , when Parks was fired from " Miss America " in the 1980s , the pageant lost many viewers out of sympathy with Bert . But that dropping of Parks was an example of what the producers of the show faced in the 1980s . There had been dwindling interest and ratings for several years . Many felt the show was old fashioned because of the idiotic talent sections and the stupid questions ( Question : " What do you wish for ? " ; Usual answer : " World peace ! " ) . Others , especially feminists , were put off by the idea that the contests were demeaning " meat markets " displaying women for sex purposes only - and not really emphasizing women's brains . The pageants are still around , but they lack the exposure they had back in the 1950s , 1960s , and 1970s . Even recent scandals have made one question the entire idea more ( the best known Miss America of the last twenty years was Vanessa Williams , who lost the title for an infraction of the rules , and subsequently had a successful - and still flourishing - acting career : something that rarely happens to the regular winners ) . Here , there has been a bombing ( and killing ) at the " Miss United States " beauty pageant . As a result an FBI team is assigned to figure out who did this . The team happens to find evidence that suggests a " Unibomber " type did , but they don't know for certain . One of the recent recruits , Sandra Bullock , is to enter the contest as " Miss New Jersey " . This is done with the knowledge of the contest's chairperson and spokeswoman ( and former " Miss United States " ) Candace Bergen . Bergen is not happy about the choice : Bullock is all professional FBI agent , with little in the way of a sense of fun , and absolutely no sense of style or even rudimentary knowledge of make-up . The FBI team , headed by Benjamin Bratt , assigns a former member of the " Miss United States " pageant ( Michael Caine ) to " prettify " and prepare Bullock for her assignment . It almost leads to mutual murder . Caine is a man of style and knows what wins contest audiences . Nothing he sees about Bullock remotely covers this . Bullock finds Caine insulting ( he admits to a stylish elitism ) , and she finds the new regimen impossible . Not only must she learn some talent ( they finally pick up on her playing the musical glasses , like Ben Franklin's armonica ) , but she has to walk with poise , be graceful , and keep her weight under control ( some of the best jokes deal with her constant attempts at stealing donuts when she is supposed to be eating carrots and vegetables ) . She is also trying to see the value of the contest . Bullock believes in the modern age of feminism , and works hard at being a good agent . She sees the contest as a sexist , out-of-date affair . She also notes it brings out the worst in the other contestants , most of whom are basically good types but are now taking cheap shots at each other in efforts to win the contest . She is particularly protective about " Miss Rhode Island " ( Heather Burns ) , who seems to have self-confidence problems and hopes to improve herself by winning the contest . Bullock is also finding her current job annoying in a non-professional manner : she and Bratt are both attracted to each other , but she can't find any time to make time for him ( nor he for her ) . If they get together it is for the business of finding the bomber threatening the contest , or for Bratt taking a sullen Bullock for training sessions with a snooty Caine . This is hardly a good way to develop a love affair . Finally there is the problem of Candace Bergen - a long time supporter of the contest , she sees it as actually helping the winners by giving them scholarships that can assist them in furthering careers in all professions ( and thus raising the image of women ) . And she resents the all-to-easy dismissal Bullock keeps bringing up when she shows what she thinks of the contest . The film also has it's version of Parks , in it's traditional host played by William Shatner . Certainly not the same as his " Captain Kirk " or even ( currently ) " Denny Crane " , Shatner's " Stan Fields " has a popular following among the older generation , who like his pleasant inane jokes ( you can tell after awhile what he's going to say as a joke ) , and his singing the theme song . His performance is like additional icing on the cake . And a well made cake it is .
A Reformation With Music	Again like the 1938 version with Reginald Owen , I like this version of " A Christmas Carol " , but I still prefer the two with Alistair Sim and with George C . Scott . This one is first rate as an entertainment , and it is nice to see not only Albert Finney but Alec Guiness and Edith Evans in a film based on Dickens They are not the only familiar faces here . Kenneth More is the Ghost of Christmas Present , and Roy Kinnear is one of the two luckless charity collectors who stumble by ill-chance into Scrooge & Marley's at the start of the film . Even Gordon Jackson has a small part ( not as good as his role in " The Great Escape " or " Upstairs Downstairs " though ) . ( Guiness , of course , had been Herbert Pocket in the 1946 " Great Expectations " , and " Fagin " in the 1947 " Oliver Twist " , and would be in a two part television film / miniseries based on " Little Dorrit " in the 1980s . Evans appeared as " Aunt Betsy Trotwood " in " David Copperfield " about the same time she was in this film . ) If I like it why do I seem so down on it ? Not really down , but it is because of what it comes across as . In 1968 " Oliver " swept the Academy Awards including " Best Picture " . It had been a tremendously successful stage musical in London and New York . It had one of the truly flawless scores of all time : up there with " Oklahoma " , " Annie Get Your Gun " , " Pal Joey " , " Kiss Me Kate " , " My Fauir Lady " , and " West Side Story " . But that's just it - the score had been tested before it reached the screen . People knew the tunes quite well . " Scrooge " was written to capitalize on the success of " Oliver " ( same great author , same good story , same memorable tunes ) . Now Leslie Bricusse is a fine composer / song writer . But let's face it . Given all the great tunes from " Oliver " there was only one lasting song from " Scrooge " that became a standard : " Thank You Very Much ! " . The other tunes are serviceable , but forgettable . " Thank You Very Much ! " was a show stopper ( compare it's appearance and reappearance in the film with the tune that Fezziwig ( Laurence Naismith ) sings while dancing at his Christmas ball - that's lively too , but you don't recall it's melody very well afterward ) . ( The funny thing about " Thank You Very Much ! " is that most people who hear it before they see the film don't realize the irony in the tune when first played . The Londoners who are thanking ( God ) for " the nicest thing that anyone's ever done for me ! " are happy and joyous because Scrooge has died , and their debts to him will probably be gone with him . He is , after all , a heartless usurer . It is not until he totally reforms that he leads the song as an admission of his being a changed man ( and canceling all those debts , as well as sharing his wealth with many people ) . It similar to a song that has never been quite as popular but is the sole number from the musical " Zorba " that had any popularity at all : " Happy Birthday " . " My mother said that little girls were made of sugar . . . Happy Birthday ! Happy Birthday " , goes the first line , but the song is not sung by a young girl or woman , but by a woman who is dying and in delirium ( she is thinking of herself as a young girl ) . ) That aside , the film was again entertaining . It does restore part of the descent of Scrooge to his selfishness : the collapse of his romance with Isabelle Fezziwig ( due to his increase pursuit of wealth ) . This aspect of him is also touched on in the Sim and Scott versions , but not in the Owen version . Even Mr . McGoo's version touched on it . It also offers the first chance for Finney ( as the present day Scrooge ) to split with his earlier younger version . The film follows all the other main points , except that we finally see the third ghost's face ( a death mask ) and Scrooge is thrown down into a fiery pit . He is met again by Marley ( Guiness ) in a second scene that was not in the story . It actually is funny in a macabre way , as Scrooge finds what is in store for him in hell . Although Guiness did not like the film ( it actually physically injured him badly ) he seems to enjoy this scene . It's again a worthy film to view , as is Owens ' , but try to catch the versions with Sim and with Scott .
Benning at her fun best	It is 1938 and the clouds are building up across the channel from Germany and Czechoslavakia . But we are aware of this , and yet are not concentrating on it . For Somerset Maugham is concentrating on his favorite world - where he made his first real mark . In his day Maugham was probably one of the top three or four British dramatists ( with Shaw , Coward , and Pinero ) on the West End . Today everyone who thinks of Maugham the dramatist does not think of " The Circle " , or other plays of his , but of " Rain " ( i . e . " Sadie Thompson " ) . But " Rain " the play was based on his short story not on any play he wrote . So what is recalled as " his " most famous play was rally not " his " . But his short stories and novels remain powerful fodder for movies to this day , if his plays seem to be a trifle too elegant for modern tastes . I did see " The Circle " in 1990 on Broadway and it was entertaining , but I thought it required an audience willing to give it some slack considering the dialog ( it seemed at time too talky ) . Still if we think Maugham dated , just recall three years ago they did a second movie of " The Painted Veil " . " Being Julia " is based on a short novel he wrote about one of the great ladies of the West End : another Mrs . Patrick Campbell or Gladys Cooper . Julia ( Annette Benning ) has had years of success and glamor , and she even has had a son by her producer / director husband Michael ( Jeremy Irons ) . But she is bored , and has reached that middle aged crisis point . Her friends rally to keep up her spirits , such as the theater owner ( Miriam Margulies ) , her son Rupert ( Michael Culkin ) , her assistant Evie ( Juliet Stephenson ) , and her close friend and fellow actor Archie Stephenson ( Leigh Lawson ) . She is also getting splendid advice from the dead - her mentor and the man who discovered her Jimmie Langton ( Michael Gambon ) , whose ghost constantly reminds her of what she has to concentrate on to retain her star status . Rupert , when he is visiting , happens to bring a young American named Tom Fennell ( Shaun Evan ) . Julia has a loosely arranged marriage with her husband , so he does not bat an eyelash as Julia and the young man ( old enough to be her son ) spend all their time together . The payoff comes when Tom takes Julia to see an " experimental " play that has a friend of his in it . The friend Avrich ( Lucy Punch ) is a young blond woman , and Julia sees that the young woman has talent . So she ( with all the best intentions ) tells the young woman she can get her a special try-out with her husband at the theater . The young woman is really excited at this good news . But shortly afterward , Julia discovers that Tom is not really interested in her as much as in Avrich . Julia pulls herself together to break her affair , and does not go back on her promise . She begins to overact ( Michael notices her overwrought recitation of lines in the play she is in ) . She is ordered to return home for a vacation . In the meantime Michael meets Avrich at the try-out , and sees she can act , so he hires her for the next play . Julia is slowly aware that her friends are not really happy about what happened to her regarding Tom and Avrich . She seems to have been used here . She gets her final slap from Rupert , who confides in her that he never liked Tom ( Julia thought they were chums ) . She is a trooper , and she joins the cast for the new play that is going into rehearsals . Avrich is there and they are to share a scene for ten minutes , dominated by the young lady . Julia goes along with this , and slowly builds up the situation making additions and suggestions that will enhance the younger actress's performance . This surprises everyone , but since she is willing to do it they go along with it . But what is she really up to ? With Somerset Maughamm you can just imagine - his characters do not fade or go gently into that good night . Let us just say it turns out to be brilliant theater . Benning has probably never given a more elegant and wonderful performance - far from her Presidential girlfriend in " The American President " who is briefly a doormat for policy . For all her glamor she enjoys a glass of beer with her dinner - a nice touch that . Irons is fine - his role in support this time , though he does bring authority to his directing scenes . Lawson gives all his support to Julia , only to find she is unaware of his own desires , and the scene of this mutual discovery is actually somewhat sweet . Gambon appears every so often , shaking his head regarding he temporary lack of commitment to drama . His gray bald pate and his opera cape make him look wiser still . Michael Culkin shows he is growing up in his lunch scene with his mother , wherein he shows he is wiser than his years . Although there is a similarity to " All About Eve " ( that has been referred to by several people on this board ) that film created a total schemer in Eve Harrington . Julia , unlike Margo Channing , is generous to a fault regarding offering help to her young rival ( at the point it is offered she has seen the young rival acting , and realizes she is good - she also thinks of her as a protégé ) . It is only later that she thinks she was set up by Tom and the girl , and that is what hurts . And that is what she settles so effectively in the end .
Jean's torn dress , and " Von Stroheim " gets the treatment	" Double Whoopie " is recalled because it was one of two films where Jean Harlow and Laurel & Hardy crossed paths ( the other was " Bacon Grabbers " ) . It was only one sequence but it is done so perfectly that it remains memorable to this day . We are at a great city hotel , and they are expecting a leading European prince and his party . They are also expecting a new doorman and groom . Enter Ollie , grandly dressed in his doorman's uniform ( which is , of course , identical to a royal prince's uniform ) . He is treated like the great man he has always seen himself as - although he does not deserve to be a great man . Ollie only reveals his real identity when he signs the guest book ( his hand exercise in the air is similar to what Art Carney would do years later on " The Honeymooners " when limbering up ) . Quickly disabused of their error , Ollie and Stan are told to go to their posts . Most people looking at " Double Whoopie " today see the spoofing ( by Hans Joby ) of Von Stroheim's persona in " Foolish Wives " , complete with mile long cigarette holder and monocle . They fail to see that Hardy's doorman is also based on another character : Emil Jannings doorman in " The Last Laugh " , who is treated with respect because of his uniform , and is stripped of his self-dignity when he is demoted and loses his uniform . Ollie is not stripped , but he certainly is put in his subservient place quickly . Joby arrives , and has a series of increasingly aggravating mishaps concerning his use of the elevator , which Stan or Ollie take over causing Joby to fall again and again into the shaft ( dirtying all of his fine apparel . This gradually leads him to threaten war ! But he is not the only one who crosses the boys . There is Charlie Hall , one of their best perennial foes . Charlie is a cab driver , and several times Stan blows Ollie's cab signaling whistle , causing Charlie to pull into the hotel's driveway , and putting on his cab meter . Of course , when Ollie tries to explain it wasn't him , Charlie does not believe it , and increasing threatens to break his neck . A limo pulls up , and out steps the beautiful Harlean Carpenter ( a . k . a . Jean Harlow ) . As this is a silent short film , her plebeian , nasal voice is not evident . We can fully believe her a socialite . Snobby , she fully accepts Ollie's grand manner of welcoming her and accompanying her to the front desk . Neither is aware ( nor are the people in the lobby ) that Stan , in shutting the car door , causes it to close on her gown , so she is walking in her slip . Eventually she is aware of what has happened , and runs out . By the way , that is the total sequence of Harlow in the film - about a minute and a half . Others get pulled into the increasing crescendo of errors and blunders , including one unfortunate gentleman whose shirt is ripped off by Stan , and who subsequently also has a mustard plaster ripped off painfully by Stan . By the time the film is over there are people chasing people ( including policeman Tiny Sandford after a frightened Charlie Hall ) throughout the lobby - just as the boys leave , looking thoroughly disappointed at the behavior of everyone around them . It is a wonderful little comedy or ever increasing disaster on disaster . If Harlow does not get as much time as one wants , while unfortunate , it is just as well that her footage is so good . Ironically , although MGM did have distribution rights to Laurel & Hardy's work with Hal Roach ( and they did appear in some MGM performances in the 1930s ) , they never made a sound film with Harlow . But they almost did . In 1934 Laurel & Hardy appeared in the film " Hollywood Party " , where they had a memorable sequence with Lupe Velez regarding breaking eggs . The film had originally been planned to have a musical score by Rodgers and Hart , and was to have many first rank stars in it , including Harlow as a telephone operator in a movie studio who dreams of becoming a star . But the plans were dropped , and the final movie was not what at all like the original idea . Still Harlow never fully left the boys ' film world . In " Beau Hunks " , Hardy joins the French Foreign Legion to forget the woman he loves ( Jean Harlow ) . He looks sadly at her photograph several times . Imagine his chagrin when he finds that most of the other legionnaires also joined to forget her . . . and that the leader of the Riffs also has a sad crush on Harlow !
" Had it not been for these things . . . . "	James Thurber is best recalled for his wonderful cartoons ( mostly printed in The New Yorker magazine in the 1920s through 1950s ) and his remarkably fine short stories and essays . He recently got an ultimate accolade ( posthumously ) by having a volume of his prose and cartoons published in " The Library of America " series . The two longest pieces of writing that he created that people remember are his short story , turned into a film , " The Secret Life of Walter Mitty " , and his other short story turned into a television dramatization , " The Greatest Man in the World " . Also his writings were the basis of a wonderful television series ( in 1969 - 1970 ) " My World And Welcome To It " starring William Windom . Quite a bit of mileage for Thurber's work . He only ( as far as I know ) wrote one play . He collaborated with Elliott Nugent on THE MALE ANIMAL , a comedy set on a college campus , that dealt with the limits of free speech and academic freedom on a college campus . Tommy Turner ( Henry Fonda ) , and English professor in a mid-western college , is happily married to Ellen ( Olivia de Havilland ) when two disasters hit him in one weekend . One of his students , Michael Barnes ( Herbert Anderson ) , is the editor of the college newspaper , and he writes an article praising Turner's outspokenness and encouragement of democracy , and mentioning that Turner is going to conclude a course on great epistolary ( letter ) writing with the final letter of Bartolomeo Vanzetti , the convicted anarchist murderer ( ? ) / martyr . This turns out to be unwelcome publicity to Tommy . Secondly it is timed for the alumni weekend , when the arrivals include the bullying head of the Board of Trustees Ed Keller ( Eugene Palette ) and Tommy's former rival for Ellen , Joe Ferguson ( Jack Carson ) . Sex and the battles of the sexes play as much a role in the play as does political correctness and censorship . First off , Michael / Anderson apparently wrote the article because of his disappointment concerning his floundering romance with Patricia Stanley ( Joan Leslie ) , who has been showing interest in the football hero of the campus Wally Myers ( Don De Fore ) . This younger triangle mirrors the older one of Fonda , de Havilland , and Carson . Fonda is a fine teacher , but he was giving a pep talk to the disheartened Anderson . That was why he wanted to show his appreciation in writing his piece in the paper . Everyone on campus is upset by Fonda's choice of literary example . Carson ( now a successful car salesman , whose marriage is rocky and he can't understand why ) , feels it's wrong . So does de Havilland , who can't understand why Fonda would jeopardize his job by reading that anarchistic trash . And Palette is livid - a prime example of super capitalism triumphant , he has no use for those trouble-making lefties like Vanzetti . And since Palette is the head of the Board of Trustees , his anger can't be simply brushed aside . The play has many nice moments in it - Carson and Palette reliving football glories of the past , with the winning " Statue of Liberty " play , that Fonda manages to simply reduce to absurdity that Carson is left wondering what happened when he is literally ball-less . The pep talk that Palette gives regarding messages from various people who can't come in that weekend - and how banal the messages from all of them are . The attempts by Fonda to protect De Havilland with an unsuspecting ( and surprisingly honorable ) Carson in case Fonda's future is over . And the climax , when the letter is read to the entire school body . It is still quite an effective movie , though not thought of among Fonda's or de Havilland's leading performances . Interestingly enough , the letter ( while still a masterpiece of English prose ) is now known to have been ghost written between Vanzetti and a news reporter who befriended him . But that does not take away from it's effectiveness . As a study in the pros and cons of free speech and academic freedom , you could not do wrong starting out with this film .
Is Polygamy the Answer ?	Dudley Moore is a television news reporter married to lawyer Anne Reinking ( Micki ) . They are in love - deeply in love - but she is committed to her legal career . This means working overtime on her cases and briefs . So Moore is unhappy about seeing so little of her . He needs to be in a closer relationship with his wife . His producer / friend Richard Mulligan sends him on an assignment to cover a female string ensemble whose cellist is Amy Irving ( Maude ) . In demonstrating how " through the magic of creative cutting " he will be able to appear on camera asking her questions that she answered already , Dudley and Amy start chatting . And he takes her to dinner . And soon they are in love - deeply in love . Well Dudley decides to tell Anne it's all over , but discovers her awaiting him with good news : she is pregnant ! Well he can't leave a pregnant wife . . . so he returns to Amy to tell her it is all over . But she is awaiting him . She's pregnant too ! He can't desert her now either . In fact , he has to marry her . As mentioned in another of the various comments here , the opening does drag a little , but MICKI & MAUDE is one of those films that starts slow , and then goes wild . Moore ( with some assistance from pal Mulligan ) has to marry Amy , and keep her and Anne happy in their separate pregnancies without them knowing of each other . The marriage is difficult enough ( he runs into Anne's parents outside of the church that Amy and he are about to be wed in ) . The difficulties of working enough to support two families ( helped out by the fact that both wives are working too ) is exhausting - though Mulligan tries to help . Finally both wives are using two obstetricians ( George Gaynes and Wallace Shawn ) who share the same offices . They and their two patients are kept in the dark , but their nurse ( Lu Leonard ) is fully aware of what is going on and disgusted by it . A typical combination of slapstick ( which Moore handles well ) and one liners that Edwards is famous in his movies for , MICKI & MAUDE works very nicely as a comedy . If not the best comedy in Dudley Moore's career , it comes close ( especially in the conclusion to the two pregnancies at the hospital - where as a special treat Moore stumbles onto a third , unexpected secret ) . In the end , facing the wreckage of two marriages or whatever , the three leads have to invent some type of arrangement that will satisfy everyone . . . or will it ?
Mean " Joe Green " - Superstar of his team !	The two dominant opera composers in the middle years of the 19th Century were Richard Wagner of Germany and Giuseppi Verdi of Italy . There are hardly two men who were less like each other in temperament . Wagner , the arrogant genius who used " friends " left and right for his own purposes . Verdi the quiet , thoughtful man who composed some of the loveliest opera music on record . Due to his character flaws , despite the brilliance of his opera music the personality of Wagner does not hold up too well to scrutiny today . But Verdi has gained admirers since his death 105 years ago . One cannot imagine any opera company banishing his music , as Wagner's was banished for decades after World War II put his racial ideas to work . As his name translates to " Joe Green " , Verdi remains the Superstar of his team of opera composers . Oddly enough both Wagner and Verdi were subjects of mini-series about their lives and careers over twenty years ago . I have commented on Wagner's mini-series first because Richard Burton played his last great role as that defective genius . But in the supporting cast of WAGNER was British character actor Ronald Pickup , who played ( very well ) Friedrich Nietzche , Wagner's one time friend but later persistent critic . Pickup played Verdi in this series made only a year earlier . Again his performance was quite good . There was less sturm und drang in Verdi's life than in Wagner's . He always lived within his means , did not smash relationships on selfish grounds , and did not preach racial hatreds . But he was a patriot - his first great success , NABUCO ( an opera about the Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar and the Jewish " Babylonian Captivity " ) gave a choral song that became an Italian popular nationalist anthem . He had his flops . It took him years to get THE MASKED BALL to be accepted in the international repertory after it's premiere just preceded a bloody assassination attempt against Napoleon III at the Paris Opera House in 1858 - THE MASKED BALL dealt with the events leading to Ankerstrom's murder of King Gustav III of Sweden in 1792 , so the libretto had to be moved to colonial Boston in the American Revolution ! He had to change plots - RIGALETTO was originally about King Francois I of France ( 1512 - 1547 ) to a fictitious Duke of Mantua , so that the French would put the opera on . Still the number of successful operas that came out of Verdi is amazing - NABUCO , RIGALETTO , TRAVIATA , IL TROVATORE , THE MASKED BALL , OTHELLO , FALSTAFF , THE FORTUNES OF DESTINY , and many others . Verdi did not , like Wagner , write pamphlets advocating mass murders of " undesirables " . His life was full of some good works , culminating in his willing a sizable portion of his fortune and property to found a retirement home for opera singers in Italy . Seldom have I heard of anyone in Verdi's situation doing something like that - how refreshing when compared to Wagner's moving heaven and earth to have a lunatic king fund a permanent festival for Wagner's music only at Bayreuth . But for everyone who has heard of Verdi's generosity , far more have heard of Bayreuth . It was a pleasant series , with famous opera singers singing the arias , duets , trios , and quartets from the operas . Certainly it left a pleasanter feeling at the conclusion about it's hero than WAGNER did . It restores one's faith in mankind that while some swine have genius and misuse it , others exist who leave our Earth a little happier and pleasanter .
Dudley saves the Christmas Values	Starting about 1946 the tradition of doing specialized films about Christmas really began to occur in Hollywood . There had been the 1938 version of Dickens ' " A Christmas Carol " with Reginald Owen as Scrooge , " Christmas In Connecticut " in 1944 , and a major sequence in " Meet Me In St . Louis " in 1944 , but no whole real trend with a Christmas holiday framework . Then came ( within one year ) Frank Capra's " It's A Wonderful Life " , " Miracle On 34th Street , and this film , " The Bishop's Wife " . Given that " It's A Wonderful Life " was a financial failure it is odd that the other films were soon coming out - as though Capra's failure was a stimulus to major studios to look at a potential market anyway . " The Bishop's Wife " follows the same supernatural framework of " Miracle On 34th Street " . There the issue was if Kris Kringle ( Edmund Gwenn ) is actually Santa Claus . Even if the film's plot truly makes him " legally " Santa by a fluke in postal delivery and a sanity hearing , we really can't tell if Kris is the master of Christmas gift giving . The appearance of his cane in a deserted house that a little girl hopes for suggests he is , but earlier he looked troubled by the thought of getting the child such a gift . He does get an x-ray machine for a doctor friend , but it is got by a joint gift from Macy's and Gimbles . Here we know the supernatural figure is what he is supposed to be . Dudley ( Cary Grant ) is the visitor to Earth - an angel who is went when a person begs for help from the Almighty . He has been sent when Bishop Henry Brougham ( David Niven ) prays for assistance from God when he is facing the collapse of a project of building an Episcopal Cathedral . It seems that the main source of the money is from the wealthy Mrs . Hamilton ( Gladys Cooper ) and the lady is quite insistent on getting everything her way on the project . When Henry balks Mrs . Hamilton ( who was instrumental in getting him his Bishopric ) is willing to reconsider her financing the project . Henry finds his project has disrupted his relationship with his wife Julia ( Loretta Young ) as his attempts to be with her keep getting undone by committee meetings . He also has little time for lower class members of his bishopric ( including his old friend Professor Wutheridge ( Monty Wooley ) ) . So when he does pray for help , there are several areas where help is needed . Dudley was one of Grant's best liked roles where his romantic personality was minimized - he does go out several times with Julia , but their visits together while pleasant and joyful are relatively staid ( the most exciting being skating at a public rink ) . He is well restrained but the occasional looks he gives to Young show that he likes her more than an immortal holy angel is supposed to . He does not fail to do what his mission is - not only assisting Niven on his duties as a bishop , but assisting Niven in reminding him of his wonderful wife and child ( Debbie - Karolyn Grimes ) , and rekindling the spirit of Wooley in writing his masterly new history of the Roman Empire . He even finds time to put Cooper to rights - making her realize she should not feel so guilty about her real feelings about an unloved husband as to dedicate all kinds of monuments to his memory . The whole film is a charmer , and it is an odd thing that producer Sam Goldwyn had so much difficulty in achieving the final result , hiring and firing directors and actors , and getting script rewrites from Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett . But it shows how sometimes the interference of a Hollywood producer worked wonders . Somehow the original film ( with Niven as Dudley and Grant as the Bishop ) would have been hard to swallow - maybe Grant as the Bishop would have been interesting ( it would have been curious to see him as a stuffy type , and the scene with the varnished chair would have been the type of slapstick that Grant would have been at home with ) . Niven played a non-angel would-be marriage destroyer in " The Little Hut " with Stewart Granger , and proved to be no competition to Granger for Deborah Kerr . Granger was not Grant , but he could be suave like Grant . I can't see him half-way competitive to Grant either . Gladys Cooper's dowager is reminiscent of her elderly Mrs . Vale in " Now Voyager " , but her secret makes her terribly sympathetic . Wooley is quite sharp too , somewhat suspicious of Grant from the start , but perfectly willing to accept Niven's odd information about Grant's origins . Young is long suffering as a loyal , loving wife who realizes that her husband has gotten lost in his activities for glorifying his God . Also Jimmy Gleason has a nice supporting bit as Sylvester , the taxi driver who rediscovers the joys of ice skating . A wonderful seasonal film , it is always welcomed back at Christmas time - reminding us that one does not have to build vast monuments to dead loved ones or to God to celebrate Christmas , but just to recognize what is needed to share joy and love with as many people as possible .
The Prototype For Philip Roth's " The Plot Against America "	Of all the films done by Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy ( except , possibly , " Sea Of Grass " and their last film , " Guess Who's Coming To Dinner - the latter for a different reason ) , " Keeper Of The Flame " was the great downer among the Hepburn - Tracy romps . " Sea Of Grass " has a portrait of a ruthless western cattle baron played by Tracy , whose happiness is marred by Kate's dalliance with Melvyn Douglas and the actual provenance of his " son " Robert Walker ( who dies in his arms ) . " Guess " , of course , was saddened by the decline in Tracy's health , visible in several scenes , and that last moving speech about his passions for Hepburn remaining even in his old age . But " Keeper " ends with Hepburn's death . As pointed out elsewhere on this thread it was rare for Hepburn to die in her film ( " Christopher Strong " and " Mary of Scotland " come to mind as exceptions preceding " Keeper " . . . few came afterward too ) . Actually " Keeper of the Flame " is more than just the sole tragic film of the Tracy - Hepburn series . It is their only joint attempt at a film noir . It is also a thinly disguised discussion of one of the most controversial heroes of 20th Century American History : Charles Augustus Lindbergh . Robert Forrest is a great national hero , whose very existence gave the reporter Steve O'Malley ( Tracy ) a warm , glowing feeling when he was abroad , studying the mess in Europe and Asia . With people like Forrest at home , O'Malley felt that America had nothing to fear about it's security and freedom . Then , like most Americans , he was shocked and saddened to hear that Forrest was killed in a car accident on his estate . He is sent to the estate on an assignment , and intends to do a bit of personal research to give a proper final magazine monument to his hero's memory . But he meets Forrest's widow Christine ( Hepburn ) and finds that her behavior is odd - and not very upset at the death of the great man . He notes her interest in her cousin Geoff Midford ( Forrest Tucker ) , which seems too close for decency . Also he notes how Forrest's " agreeable " secretary Clive Kerndon ( Richard Whorf ) acts with a degree of secrecy and even threat towards Christine . " Keeper Of The Flame " never really makes Forrest an exact copy of Lindbergh . After all , the " Lone Eagle " was still alive in 1942 , and capable of suing MGM . But it leaves at least one " Lindbergh " trace in Forrest's background , which most people would not notice unless they read the recent novel by Philip Roth " The Plot Against America " . Roth has the Republicans , in 1940 , nominate Lindbergh to run against FDR , and Lindbergh wins . This keeps us out of World War II , and it turns our country into a neo-Fascist state . In actuality , Lindbergh was suggested as a Vice Presidential candidate to run with Wendell Wilkie , but he did not get that nomination . If you listen to Whorf's dialog , at one point he is willing to allow Tracy hear a recording of Forrest's speech at the 1940 convention rejecting that nomination . But there is no mention of how Forrest became such a national hero - certainly nothing about aviation . And there is no mention of any children with Christine who got kidnapped and murdered . As I said , the studio did not want to be sued . But the unpleasant experience of Lindbergh's American First crusade , culminating in his notorious " Des Moines " speech where he hinted at Jewish influence to push the U . S . into war , was sufficient to make the character of Forrest stand for only one other American . The slow revelation of Forrest's true character , his egomania and arrogance - his embrace of fascism for power , and his huge following with other malcontents is done well . Of course , today , seeing the film and knowing it's reputation , the effect of the slow revelations is not as effective as in it's original release in 1942 . Best moment in this is Margaret Wycherley's as Forrest's senile mother - but a senile woman whose character is as bent as her son's . Notice her comments about the size of houses . Hepburn's performance , of the two leads , is weaker - she does show her everlasting intelligence as Christine , but little of the passion that guides her to do what she has to do . Tracy is better - he is a true believer in the cult of Forrest , and his disillusionment is painful ( " Robert Forrest . . . what happened ? " ) . But for my money it is Whorf's performance which is the best , because of his quiet fanaticism in protecting the great man's secret , and his menace towards Hepburn . If one only thinks of Whorf as Sam Harris in " Yankee Doodle Dandy " ( which he made the same year ) , this performance is a revelation of his strength as a dramatic actor . Whorf had a short life ( he died in the 1960s ) , and gradually became a film and television director . He could have remained a very effective dramatic actor .
The Devils Inside a " Good " Cop	Kirk Douglas was in the forefront of a set of movie stars in the post war period ( with Montgomery Clift , Marlon Brando , James Dean , Burt Lancaster , and ( a little later ) Paul Newman ) who had more emotional problems than initially appeared in their characters . Douglas looked competent and able in every part , but sooner or later something would show his less attractive personality . When he played Midge , the great boxer , in CHAMPION , his selfishness expands and expands as his reputation does . His motivations for joining forces with Burt Lancaster's Wyatt Earp in GUNFIGHT AT THE O . K . Corral is based in part on a rivalry with John Ireland as Johnny Ringo , a rival of Doc Holiday for a woman . And his Detective Jim McLeod is a modern day Inspector Javert , ashamed of his father's criminal behavior that drove his mother insane - and determined to root out all evil , no matter how big or small it is . DETECTIVE STORY , a successful play by Sidney Kingsley , has classical unity , as it takes place all in one day - which happens to be the final day of McLeod's life . He is the central detective in the story , and we see him early enjoying a moment of joy with his wife Mary ( Eleanor Parker ) . But once he is in the precinct he is all business , involved in three cases : the arrest of two burglars responsible for nine burglaries ; the arrest of a young man ( who is actually clean-cut ) for embezzling from his employer , and the completion ( after a year ) of a serious abortion case against one Karl Scneider ( George Macready ) , a former doctor now a New Jersey farmer . Schneider has been responsible for at least one patient's death in the past , and another of his patients is currently in Bellevue Hospital in critical condition . Since Schneider has been lucky so far , McCleod is furious and keeps pushing the envelope to get him . As it turns out Schneider happens to have information on McCleod's household - which his attorney threatens to reveal to the press . The precinct commander ( Horace MacMahon ) is forced to get to the bottom of this mystery . There is no compassion whatsoever from Douglas to any criminals . He explains that when he was starting out he arrested two young punks , but took pity on them and let them go . Three days later , one killed a store owner in a robbery . Douglas says he won't make that mistake again . He never seems to notice that the other punk was not ( apparently ) in the robbery - murder , and presumably could have turned over a new leaf . So he won't give a break to the young embezzler , who stole from his employer to try to wine and dine an old girlfriend who no longer wants to know him - even though the money can be replaced . McCleod's partner Brody ( William Bendix ) is more gentle ( the young man reminds him of Bendix's dead son ) . But McLeod won't change . Then comes the shocker - Macmahon discovers the secret that Parker and Gerald Mohr ( Parker's old boyfriend ) have concealed - which Macready would have been equally willing to conceal if Douglas had not persecuted him . It destroys the peace of mind and Douglas's home-life in two shattering moments in the movie . As for the pair of burglars , one of them is a total simpleton , but the brains of the outfit ( Joseph Weismann in a great over-the-top part ) is far more colorful . . . and more deadly . In fact , Weismann and Douglass are perfectly balanced for the conclusion of the movie : literally they settle each other's hash with a couple of shots . A first class direction job by William Wyler , and the cast ( with good performances in support by Luis van Rooten , Lee Grant ( her first film part ) , and Gladys George ) . And a really good , if stagy , conclusion to a fine film .
Klane and Kotcheff succeed where Hitchcock failed	There is really nothing funny about a dead man and his corpse . Yet occasionally corpses happen to be the subject of humor . There was the amusing film ( based on a Robert Louis Stevenson novel ) THE WRONG BOX , which was elegantly done , and was quite good . There was Alfred Hitchcock's attempt at a totally funny black comedy regarding hiding a dead body in New England , called THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY . And best of all was this 1989 comedy about a body that takes on a " life " of it's own . Hitchcock's fans insist THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY is one of his greatest films . It isn't . It demonstrates that Hitchcock's sense of humor was best used as a seasoning . A good example : in FRENZY the trouble the Scotland Yard Inspector had with his wife's " continental " cooking attempts . Every now and then the action leaves the scenes involving the suspect and the real killer and the victims , and we watch the poor Inspector discussing the case with his wife ( who makes some good suggestions ) while they eat all sorts of concoctions that the poor man loathes . It is not a bad running joke - but it is not the main theme of the film . The main theme of THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY was that a number of people in a New England town all have had problems with Harry . The joke is how each of these people tries to hide the corpse , alone or with each other . They are helped by the stupidity of the local sheriff . The problem is that Hitch's originality and inventiveness began to fade in the film . After all , how many times can you show people hiding a body and make it funny ? And this was the actual plot - not a sideline to the plot . In THE WRONG BOX there were other strands ( the antics of Michael Caine , Peter Cook , Dudley Moore , Peter Sellers , Tony Hancock , Ralph Richardson , and John Mills in different directions - frequently at cross purposes ) . The fact the body gets mislaid , when it is at the center of the plot of Cook and Moore , concerning a tontine . The corresponding scheme of Mills trying to get rid of his rival Richardson for the tontine . In short the body is an element , but not the center of the joke . WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S changed this . The corpse is the center and movement of the plot , but screenplay writer Robert Klane and director Ted Kotchoff realized what THE WRONG BOX showed , and what Hitch missed . The key of the use of a dead body as a matter of humor is not hiding the body , but producing it . In THE WRONG BOX it is hidden by various people , for different reasons , but several ( Cook and Moore ) plan to produce it at a given moment - and can't . In short the body has movement despite being a body . Hitch just kept having the body of Harry dug up and moved to another grave several times - movement it's true , but repetitive movement at best . One exception , but a meaningless one - when Harry's body is put into the bathtub in Shirley MacLaine's house . Why should it be in the tub ? Hitch never really gave a reasonable reason for that . In WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S Klane and Kotchoff solved this by creating the necessity of making people believe the dead Bernie is not dead . Terry Kaiser is Bernie Lomax , the head of a large company that Andrew McCarthy ( as Larry Waters ) and Jonathan Silverman ( as Richard Parker ) work for as accountants . They discover a huge discrepancy in the books , and make the mistake of trusting this information to Bernie . They don't realize he and his partner have been looting the company . Bernie invites them to his home in the Hamptons for the weekend ( where he secretly plans to bump them off ) . What he does not realize is that his partner has decided to bump him off , so Don Calfa ( as Pacho , the hit-man ) shoots Bernie , and leaves his corpse in the house . He thinks that the two visitors or someone else will report the finding of the dead body . When Waters and Parker show up , they discover the dead man , and they are aware of his plot against them . Should they call the police ? They decide they would be suspected . So the best thing is to make it appear that Bernie is still alive , and that he is having an active , fun-filled weekend with the two fellows . With plenty of people seeing and " speaking " to Bernie during the weekend , they will make sure that when they leave , nobody will suspect them . Of course , as time passes , Pacho can't understand the failure of anyone to discover the murder . He keeps returning and " killing " the living Bernie again and again and again . But Bernie keeps surviving to be seen limboing , swimming , and even water-skiing ( my favorite part of the film ) . From a comedy about a dead body it becomes a comedy about frustration for the gunman , and of inventiveness by the two young heroes . It also is a smörgåsbord of prat falls , blows to the head , and unnatural natural accidents for actor Terry Kaiser . His performance as the all too lively when dead Bernie is one of the funniest silent comic jobs in recent movies , as his semi-smile and sunglasses make him seem crocked more than dead to everyone dancing on the beach front at his house . It is certainly more interesting than that of the actor who was " Harry " in Hitch's film - who just had to lay on the ground or get carried somewhere . Again , a clever grasp of the possibilities of the situation in reverse , in a well written and directed film like BERNIE'S , beats out the unimaginative use of the corpse as a simple prop even if the director is ( otherwise ) a master of cinema elsewhere .
One Deeply Impressed Yank Gazing At Some Fragments	I have only seen about twenty to twenty five minutes of WHERE'S THAT FIRE ? on You Tube , but I will take a risk and say that if the rest of the film is like these chunks of it it must be extremely funny . Will Hay , Moore Marriot , and Graham Moffatt made six films together in the 1930s and 1940s and they are compared by most critics to be easily the equals of the Marx Brothers in the amounts their work generates laughter . Hay always played seedy figures of some authority , who is assisted ( or hampered ) by his two associates , Marriot ( an elderly ruin of a man , who somehow is always sharper than Hay , but still stupid ) and Moffatt ( a young fat fellow who is not impressed by Hay's authority and who has an intelligent form of insolence ) . Apparently there were copy-write problems in the release of WHERE'S THAT FIRE ? It was thought to be lost until the 1970s when it was shown on television . The version that seems to be currently on DVD is missing some of the initial scenes that starts the story . An oil refinery is on fire , and the fire departments for miles around are being called in to put it out . We see all these modern motorized ( for 1940 ) firehouses going out on the call . Finally we see the firehouse of our three heroes . The bell of the alarm has been muffled , and Marriott and Moffatt are playing checkers ( and Moffatt is making the mistake of taking Marriott's advice on his moves ) . Hay is Captain Viking , the fire chief of the town of Bishop's Wallop . Viking is an working on a foam to combat fire in place of water from hoses . He comes upstairs after another explosion of his concoctions , and then hears the phone ring . He answers and learns that everyone is wondering why they have not answered the alarm . Hay asks how long the alarm has been muffled . Moffatt tells him it has been that way since he had an attack of insomnia a week before and demanded it . The three ready their fire equipment ( a steam pumper pulled by a horse , and wear fire department uniforms that look like they date from 1880 ) . They press on to fight the fire - only to find in the end they not only drove fifteen away from the flames that were visible for twenty miles , but that a second fire destroyed the town hall at Bishop's Wallop . They are given one last chance by the town council , and proceed to try to modernize the firehouse . What follows is a twenty five minute laugh fest ( in two parts on You Tube ) where Hay , Marriott , and Moffatt struggle with a new fire-pole ( to slide down upon ) . Hay , typically , has put it wrong side up , and they have to take it out of the firehouse to somehow turn it around ( or such is their " logic " ) . As a result they cause a traffic jam outside , destroy the windows of several cars , scratch paint off other cars , destroy the bric-a-brac in a store , and cause a near riot . Also , annoying Hay because of superior brains , young Charles Hawtrey of " Carry On " fame , shows up trying to get them to use Euclidean Mathematics to solve the problem . At one point the pole is tilted sixty degrees across the street , pinning old Marriott in a chair by his belly ( a kindly lady asks if she can give him tea - he agrees when she doesn't have any brandy ) . Eventually first Moffatt and then Hay got into an apartment that may give them a way to pull the pole up out of the street . The apartment is Moffatt's father's ( he's in bed with a broken foot ) . When not eating grapes that are the father's lunch , Moffatt and Hay try to get the pole up alone and can't . Hay calls for assistance . So far it resembles some of the antics of Laurel and Hardy ( I'm thinking of TOWED IN THE HOLE ) or the Three Stooges ( remember Curly trying to use his extra pipe to stop a leak in the bathroom ? ) . Now it turns into an English version of the stateroom scene in A NIGHT AT THE OPERA , as twenty men come into the room to pull the pole up out of the street . They succeed - in fact they also pull up Marriott - but they break a glass sun light ( Hay tells Moffatt's father to watch the glass now in his bed ) . They have been stepping fairly frequently on the foot . Now comes the father's doctor who tries to reassure his frantic patient , while taking time for a puff on his pipe . Hays ' insane idea was to pull the pole to the roof , turn it around ( remember that was the original purpose of all this ! ) , and then go and slowly drop it into place in the firehouse . Great idea except there is nobody on the roof to hold it in place when it is pushed there . It topples over and crashes through the roof of Moffatt's father's apartment . If you can't see the film soon I urge you to watch the hijinks of the three You Tube sections I am reviewing . Apparently the plot twist is like that of OH MR . PORTER and ASK A POLICEMAN wherein the three idiots manage to somehow outsmart ( for want of a better term ) gangs of criminals or smugglers . Here the gang steals the antique fire engine in a plot to steal the Crown Jewels . The remainder of the movie ( including somehow making the fire horse ride vertically up the side of the Tower of London ) must be a pip . All I can say is you will not stop laughing .
I Think Than Henri Desire Landru Would Have Approved	There is a constant effort by the fans of Orson Welles to pinpoint films of importance that he had a hand in even if he did not appear in them or direct them . The two most notable ones are AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS , which was based on a 1946 Broadway musical flop that Welles directed and starred in , and MONSIEUR VERDOUX . The former had a score ( a bad one ) by Cole Porter , and elaborate sets and tricks - and folded after a few months , plunging Welles into bankruptcy . He had to live in Europe afterward due to tax problems . Welles sold his interest in the musical to his producer Mike Todd . And Todd turned around and made his one great film out of AROUND THE WORLD in 1955 , without even offering Welles a cameo in it . In 1945-46 Welles also sold a screenplay and idea for a movie about the career of the French Bluebeard murderer Landru to Charlie Chaplin . Chaplin would have been directed by Welles , but instead ended up doing the film himself - and only remembering on giving Welles any credit when Welles pointedly reminded him about it . This was MONSIEUR VERDOUX . Henri Desire Landru was a criminal and second hand furniture dealer . He was married ( legitimately ) and from most accounts was a good husband ( except for having a mistress ) and a good father . But starting in 1917 Landru began romancing a series of middle aged women he met through the matrimonial columns of Paris newspapers , sweeping them off their feet , and then marrying them . He used several country locations ( most infamously a nice looking country villa at the town Gambais ) to take his brides for disposal : he would take them to the villa , kill them ( probably by poison or strangulation ) and then burn their bodies in a large stove / fireplace in the house . He may have chosen the villa too because it was near a convenient cemetery - a perfect place to hide corpse remains like bones . From 1917 to 1919 Landru ( as best the authorities figured out ) married 12 women and killed them and the son of one of them . He was caught when members of several of the families went to the police about the sudden disappearances of these ladies , and one of the families ran across Landru and tipped off the police . In arresting him they found he had a remarkably exact accounting system regarding the expense of each marriage including the cost of tickets to Gambais ( significantly two tickets going , but only one coming back ) . His trial in 1922 was an international event , and he did not disappoint . An exceptionally clever and even witty man , he actually made the court laugh frequently , until the evidence of mass murder became too evident . He was convicted , and guillotined . Henri Landru was bald headed and wore a spade beard . Charlie Chaplin , as Landru's screen clone " Henri Verdoux " has white hair , a fancy little mustache , and wears butterfly collars and homburg hats . He is a total dandy - and quite the charmer . He also is able to thrown himself into each different personality and role he plays as the husbands of the various victims . In actual fact he is a bank teller who lost his job - and had a crippled wife and sickly child to take care of . He pretends to be ( among other things ) a furniture dealer , a retired sea captain , an expert on jewelry ( he does show some knowledge of jewelry with one of his wives ) , and several other types of professionals . Chaplin , wisely , made most of the women Verdoux romances pretty obnoxious . But he is defeated by one of them - Annabella ( Martha Raye , in arguably her greatest comic role ) . Annabella is a wealthy ex - theater person who has a zest for life , is fairly guileless ( she is cheated by two old friends at one point ) , and has some gross physical habits that disgust the fastidious Henri . But every time he tries to kill her ( including a hysterical attempt at drowning her in a rowboat ) he gets injured or frustrated . She and only one other one of his would-be victims escape his murder plans . So does a young woman ( Marilyn Nash ) whom Landru picks up one night to experiment with using a new poison . But the young woman is so full of promise and shares some of his ideas that he lets her live . Later she will be the last woman he shares a good evening with , but by then she has become the mistress of an arms manufacturer . Chaplin used the film to rip apart the hypocrisy of modern life - we condemn the Landrus and George Joseph Smiths and Al Capones who use murder for money purposes , but we have a society that insists that building large armed forces are good ideas , that rewards arms manufacturers and perverted scientists making weapons with money and glory . Made after two world wars shattered Europe , and after the Great Depression showed the emptiness of greed , MONSIEUR VERDOUX indicted modern society as nothing else in Chaplin's work had ever done before . It is the most hopeless of his greatest films - for it ends with it's hero going to his doom , and welcoming that doom . For Verdoux knows that unless society can change ( and he doubts it will ) we will all be following him soon .
" The Master " in WASHINGTON SQUAR	Because he so identified with England in his last thirty years ( and even became a British citizen during World War I ) people tend to forget that Henry James was an American - as American as his celebrated psychologist / philosopher brother William ( the " good " James Boys , as opposed to their non-relatives Frank and Jesse ) , and his fellow Gilded Age novelists Sam Clemens / " Mark Twain " and William Dean Howells . His early writings , including " The American " , " The Portait Of A Lady " , and " The Europeans " were written while he was an American citizen . His later classics , " The Spoils Of Poynton " , " What Maisie Knew " , " The Ambassadors " , " The Golden Bowl " , and " The Wings Of The Dove " , were written when he resided in England . The novels he wrote through 1897 ( " What Maissie Knew " being the last of these ) were short and controlled in terms of descriptions . But his final set of novels ( beginning with " The Ambassadors " ) had a more flowery writing , as James struggled to find " le mot juste " in every description . Many like this , but I find it a peculiar failure . It takes him three pages of description in " The Wings Of The Dove " to show Mily Theale is looking down from an Alpine peak to the valley thousands of feet below . " Washington Square " was written in the late 1870s , and was based on an anecdote James heard about a fortune hunter who tried to move in on one of James ' neighbors in Manhattan . The neighbor , when a young woman , was wealthy and and would be wealthier when her father died ( she was an only child ) . The father did not think highly of the daughter's choice of boyfriend , and a war of wills between the two men left the young woman scarred . James took the story and fleshed it out . One has to recall that while ultimately this is based on James ' great novel , the film proper is based on the dramatization by the Goetzs . So there are changes ( one of which I will mention later ) . But the basic confrontation between the father and the suitor remains true . On stage the father was played by Basil Rathbone , and in his memoirs ( " In And Out Of Character " ) , Rathbone makes a case that Dr . Sloper ( his role ) was not the villain in the novel - it was Sloper who was trying to protect his naive daughter Catherine from the clutches of fortune hunting suitor Morris Townshend . It's a nice argument , and one can believe that Rathbone / Sloper was less villainous than Morris . But his desire to protect Catherine does not prevent his cold and aloof treatment of her - he has little respect for her personality . This is tied to the Doctor's constant mourning of his wife ( Catherine's perfect mother ) . It enables Dr . Sloper to compare and belittle his daughter . The Goetz play and screenplay show ( as does the novel ) that the battle of wills between the two men only hurts poor , simple Catherine . There are only two major changes from the novel . First , in the novel Dr . Sloper does not discover how his contempt for his child loses her love . He only sees that Catherine will not see reason about what a loser Morris is . So he does disinherit her ( she only has her mother's fortune of $10 , 000 . 00 a year , not her father's additional $20 , 000 . 00 ) . Secondly , when Morris does return in the end in the novel , years have passed , and he is a querulous fat man . The dramatic high point when Catherine locks the door of the house on Morris is not in the novel . Olivia De Haviland's performance as Catherine is among her most sympathetic and satisfying ones , as she tries to navigate between two egotists , and manages to avoid a shipwreck that neither would totally disapprove of for their own selfish reasons ) . Her second Oscar was deserved . Ralph Richardson's Sloper is a curious combination of cultured gentleman , egotist , and caring father , who only realizes what his behavior costs him when he is dying and it is too late . Montgomery Clift's Morris is a clever scoundrel , able to hide his fortune-hunting tricks behind a mask of care and seeming devotion to Catherine . Only when he learns that she has broken with her father does Morris show his true colors - suggesting that a reconciliation may still be possible . Finally there is Miriam Hopkins as Aunt Penniman , a talkative blood relative who does have a sense of reality and romance in her - she does try to make a case with Dr . Sloper that he accept Morris for Catherine's emotional happiness , but Sloper rejects the idea because he distrusts Morris so much . These four performances dominate the film , and make it a wonderful , enriching experience - as only " the Master's " best writings usually are .
A Missed Opportunity for CBS	It is hard to believe that this show was on sixteen years ago for only one season . Carol Burnett's programs have normally been quite successful - her own variety show lasting over a decade . But this half hour show never found a consistent audience to keep it going beyond it's first season . With a regular cast including Richard Kine and Terry Kiser Burnett's show did skits that concentrated on some theme or story . In one she and Bernadette Peters were close friends as well as partners who compose jingles for commercials ( they sing one about a dog food ) . Their agent discovers that she can get a job for Peters who is the composer , but Burnett is not wanted for the job . The episode deals with will Peters be willing to split the team and friendship for her new job , or will Burnett sacrifice and let her friend improve herself . Richard Kine was a burglar in a futuristic episode ( actually a downer ) about a world of the future where everyone is armed and at war with everyone else . He invades an apartment owned by Burnett where she and three friends are playing cards , and he is the most peace loving person among the bunch . In another episode ( somewhat surreal ) Burnett is searching for something she lost and finds the ultimate " Lost and Found " room presided over by Kine - in which ( among other things ) she can find her lost virginity , and the lost potency of the man who got her knocked up with her only daughter . In one funny episode , set in Las Vegas , Burnett ran an all night marriage parlor in which she was the local justice of the peace . But she is confronted by a weird group of people : a woman who wants to marry a wooden dummy ( shades of the sinister dummy in DEAD OF NIGHT ) . The crazy marriage is about to go through , when a woman shows up claiming she is married to the dummy , and bringing out a baby dummy ! ! But the episode leads to a sweet conclusion : Burnett has never been engaged , despite helping all these marriages she has performed . As she is closing her chapel , Terry Kiser shows up . He has been noticing her for a long time , and he introduces himself as a possible boyfriend . Burnett is amazed at first , but she finds he is not crazy or odd but actually compatible to what she has thought of as a boyfriend . At the end they leave together . The writing was usually quite sharp on the show , and varied from satire and comedy to tragedy . In a way it took off from the sketches done by Ms Burnett , Vicki Lawrence , Harvey Korman , Tim Conway , Lyle Waggoner , and Dick Van Dyke on the variety show . Yet the audience for this series just never arose to support it . So it closed after it's brief run , a pleasant memory for those fortunate enough to have watched it .
Hogarth's " Good Apprentice and Bad Apprentice " brought up - to - date . . . in a manner of speaking .	SCARFACE was a study of a truly monstrous , violent malefactor - a kingpin of crime . LITTLE CAESAR too deals with the rise of a criminal to being the head of the criminal organization ( or a leading figure in it ) before he too falls . It has been nicely compared to a modern version of Andrew Carnegie's philosophy of self-help , improvement , and modernizing your business organization . But THE PUBLIC ENEMY was a type of modern version of the William Hogarth series of prints about the Good and Bad apprentices . The prints ( I think there were ten ) showed two boys who are raised side by side in a poor area of London . But one is hard working and industrious , and the other is lazy and opportunistic , and vicious . The hard working one slowly rises in the world as he prospers , and the bad one slowly becomes a criminal . In the long run the good one becomes the Lord Mayor of London , and the bad one ends up on the gallows for murder . Tom Powers ( Jimmy Cagney ) is the " bad apprentice " and his brother Mike ( Donald Cook ) the " good apprentice " but the story is more twisted than Hogarth's straightforward story suggests . The two brothers are the sons of a strict father ( a policeman ) and an overly sentimental mother : Beryl Mercer . Mercer is not one of my favorite actresses ( all her major roles are incredibly teary women , usually mothers - her acting must have been acceptable in the 1930s , but is hardly worthwhile in the 2000s ) . However , here her performance actually fits . She favors Tom ! She is obviously a weak type - her husband was the dominant figure in the family . Once he left , she could not bring herself to punish Tom - as he deserved to be . Instead she let him run wild . She also barely appreciates Mike's sacrifices ( he goes to fight in World War I , and gets gassed , and while Tom's material wealth increases due to crime , Mike is only able to get a job as a streetcar conductor ) . At the conclusion of the film , one wonders what the death of Tom is going to do to her . Probably it will kill her . Tom and his friend Matt Doyle ( Edward Woods ) graduate from petty thefts for the gang run by " Putty Nose " ( Murray Kinnell ) . He leaves them in a lurch , and yet they continue their criminal rise as pals . We see them bullying a speakeasy owner in using their brand of beer ( Tom really enjoying enjoying it , by the way ) . Later we see their use as killers for gangsters . Eventually they even the score with " Putty Nose " , who pleads for his life when they catch with him . By that time they are working for Nails Nathan , getting nicer apartments , better clothing , and money to buy gifts for Mom ( and to show up brother Mike ) . Tom and Matt move from common whores to molls ( Tom's is Mae Clarke - who gets the grapefruit treatment in the film's best recalled sequence ) . Then Tom meets a classier dame : the slumming socialite Gwen Allen ( Jean Harlow ) . The scenes between Cagney and Harlow are too few to really judge any screen chemistry by . Harlow's character is a measuring stick , showing the highpoint of Tom's rise in the world through crime . Sadly , after this film , they never were re-teamed again . Her future partners were Gable , Beery , Tone , and others on the MGM lot , not the Warner's lot . The death of Nathan leads to the slow disintegration of the gang , beginning with the death of Matt in a street assassination that Tom escapes . But at the end of the line for Tom is in avenging his friend : he obviously has killed or seriously wounded many in the shootout , but he gets badly wounded himself . And in the end he does get kidnapped from the hospital , and is dumped , dead , on his doorstep . Mike discovers his corpse . I don't envy him - he'll have to tell what happened to his mother who is busy preparing Tommy's room up stairs .
The Greatest War Comedy ?	It is " generally " ( or should I pun and say " General Lee " ? ) said that the best comedy of the silent film career of Buster Keaton's career was his Civil War epic THE GENERAL . Apparently planned with more care than any of his other film projects , it involved not only researching a period of history some sixty years in the past , but getting the correct rolling stock , costumes , weapons , and props to make it look correct . And it worked so well that Keaton never really could ( despite some great moments in STEAMBOAT BILL JR . ) out-do it . In fact , the closest thing to his best sound film ( or film that he influenced that was a sound film ) was his work with Red Skelton in the comedy A SOUTHERN YANKEE , where he returned to a Civil War theme . THE GENERAL ( as I mentioned in discussing the Disney film THE GREAT LOCOMOTIVE CHASE ) is based on the " Andrews Raiders " stealing of the Confederate locomotive " The General " , and an attached train , which was used to damage tracks and bridges . The raid ( in February 1862 ) was from northern Georgia into Tennesee . It only lasted 20 miles , as the coal for the train was used up and not replaced . Andrews and several raiders were hanged after a trial . Others went to southern prisoner of war camps . The effect of the incident far outstripped it's military success . The damage ( after all ) could be repaired . But like Jimmy Doolittle's Raid over Tokyo in April 1942 , it had a tremendous effect hurting Confederate morale . The area attacked was hundreds of miles from the battlefronts of Virginia or Kentucky / Northern Tennessee that were in the current events of the War at the time , and so was considered safe by the Confederate government and public . Instead it had been shown quite easy for Northern raiders to hit and run for awhile . Despite it being a brief incident of the war , the locomotive chase would remain famous after more important events were forgotten . The actual locomotive is still in existence in a museum in the south . When Lesney did it famous series of " Models of Yesteryear " the first locomotive that was included in that series of collectible toys was " The General " . The story , however , was ultimately a downer . But Keaton took the basic tale and made it a comedy of the period . First he changes the viewer's perspective - it is not concentrating on Andrews and his men , but on the Confederates . Secondly , he builds up the story of Johnny Gray , a railroad engineer who tries to enlist but is rejected ( the twist of logic failure in the script is that the Confederate draft board head does not bother to explain to Johnny that he is more useful as an engineer to the cause than as a soldier ) . Because Keaton's family and girl friend ( Marion Mack ) see he is not enlisted , they believe he turned coward . Johnny eventually is the only person who tries to retake " the General " from the raiders , and the film has actually two chases in it - first Andrews and his men stealing the train , and then Keaton sneaking into Northern lines with Mack and retaking it . Along the way are many comic classic moments , such as Keaton carefully standing on the cowcatcher and carefully using physics to knock off broken wooden ties that might derail the train , or when ( at a moment of dejection ) Keaton sits on the connecting rod that links the trains wheels and finds himself pulled into the locomotive barn while in a sitting positions . The situation of fighting the Yankees during the second chase , and finding Marion Mack there " helping " him , are wonderful - especially when she judges which lumps of coal are pretty enough to be used to keep the engine fired ( she throws away the ugly little ones ) . Keaton's reaction to her stupidity is a wonderful moment . The classic conclusion of the comedy is the battle of the two sides at the river , and the burning of the railroad bridge ( with it's destruction of a second locomotive ) . It has been called the most expensive sight gag in history . By the way , the Northern General who ordered the locomotive across the bridge is of some special interest . He was Mike " Turkey Strut " Donlin , a frequent member ( and starring player ) of the old New York Giants under John McGraw and Christy Matthewson in the first two decades of the 20th Century . Donlin ( who got his funny nickname from the way he ran the bases ) left baseball to become a film actor ( he had worked a bit in vaudeville ) . Keaton was a sports fan ( and showed this in his film COLLEGE , where he shows his abilities in several sports ) and hired Donlin . This was the latter's most famous performance - look at his reaction to the collapse . It must be regarded as Keaton's finest film , and certainly the best war comedy to come out in the silent period . It may also be the best war comedy to come out of any period of motion pictures .
There is still time brothers ?	I find it fascinating that the films that stressed the end of the world scenario did not start popping up until 1959 , the year of ON THE BEACH . Within a few years ( as pointed out elsewhere on this thread ) , FAILSAFE and DR . STRANGELOVE came out as did the Ray Milland film , PANIC IN THE YEAR ZERO . Why it took so long to discuss nuclear disaster is probably a bi-product of the McCarthy Period . To question nuclear deterrent was to be a pawn or supporter of the Communists in Russia and elsewhere . Interestingly the sole movie I can think of prior to 1959 about nuclear war was the comedy THE ATOMIC KID with Micky Rooney and Robert Strauss , and the plot there was that Rooney survived an atomic blast at ground zero after eating peanut butter sandwiches . That's hardly a serious film discussion on the dangers of fallout . It also helped that the Stanley Kramer film ON THE BEACH was based on a very popular best seller . I have mentioned elsewhere that Nevil Shute was a popular novelist of the late 1940s and 1950s , but best recalled ( at least up to 1954 ) as one of the best writers on airplane-based stories like NO HIGHWAY . He began to surprise critics with two novels that remain popular to this day , but have nothing to do with aircraft : ON THE BEACH ( about nuclear holocaust ) and A TOWN NAMED ALICE ( about life in the back-lands of Shute's native Australia ) . ON THE BEACH is a dramatic story that eschews over-dramatizing . The characters are facing the final crisis of Earth , and there is no quick fix or solution . Everyone is going to die . There is no massive outbreak of lawlessness - everyone seems resigned to the inevitable . And I think that is why the story works . . . when you see people running amok and in panic you are inclined to be amused at how people can't control their fears ( despite the fact that we would all be in a state of near panic at such a time ) . By seeing the resignation of the characters , and how it releases them to make admissions to each other before it is too late , drives this ultimate tragedy home . Everyone becomes honest . Nuclear physicist Fred Astaire ( in a stunningly good dramatic performance ) is asked who he thought was the most dangerous man in the 20th Century . He looks blasé while answering ( without naming someone like Hitler or Stalin ) " Albert Einstein " - the ultimate atomic theorist and scientist of the century . A sailor who comes from San Francisco sees the town is totally dead when Gregory Peck takes the submarine he commands into the harbor . Shortly afterward the sailor jumps off the submarine , and swims back to the shore . Peck does not stop him - subsequently he speaks to the sailor who is sitting on the shore " fishing " . The sailor knows he'll be dead soon but he's comfortable because he's at home . Peck leaves him there , knowing that the sailor will be happier to die in his home town than thousands of miles away in Australia . The confrontation of truth in the dying days of earth becomes painful , as colleagues reveal their affection and love for each other . We also see how several ( including Astaire ) decide to speed their ends to avoid the pain of nuclear contamination and slow death . It is one of the grimmest , and most effective film endings of modern movies - and the last image of the banner stating there is still time ( meant to be for religious reflection actually ) haunts the audiences that watch this film to this day .
Brilliantly innovative love story	ALGIERS is about a man who is trapped meeting a woman who is likewise trapped . They are perfect together , but their love is not going to get anywhere . For he is a convict on the run from a long prison sentence - hiding in a disreputable " colorful " section of the city of Algiers in ( what was then ) France's North African " departments " - but is now the city in Algeria . Pepi Le Moko is only safe in the " Casbah " , because , although a respected police detective like Inspector Simane is tolerated few others are . But Pepi dreams of his homeland . He misses France , specifically his native Paris . But it is impossible to return without facing serious criminal penalties . He meets Gabrielle ( " Gaby " ) who is a tourist with her best friend and their two fiancés . Both fiancés are substantial men ( Gaby's is M . Giraux - a fat , unsympathetic type who knows what he wants and will pay for it ) . But her background was as a worker in the basement of a department store - marriage will free her from that . But she will be tied to her fat husband . The two find in each other more than a heavenly spark . Both remind each other of a happier world : that of Paris where both grew up ( ironically in nearby neighborhoods ) . They really discover each other talking about Metro stations in Paris ' subway . And both realize that with each other they might be free again . But can they get together ? It is a marvelous film . Pepi does have a girl ( Ines ) who is trying to awaken in him her own passions , but finds first she is battling his desire to return to France , and then he is pursuing Gaby . There are also the members of Pepi's gang , who are his eyes into the goings on in the city outside his sanctuary . And there are dangers in the sanctuary : traitors like Regis who can be deadly in their activities . In the end we are never bored by this film . It was ( with MAYERLING ) the film that introduced Charles Boyer to movie audiences as a great film lover ( and here a sad one ) . It was also the film that re-enforced stardom on Hedy Lamar after ECSTASY . Sigried Lurie's Ines is intensely tragic , and Gene Lockhart properly sleazy as Regis ( and his final scene very satisfactory to the audience ) . As the disagreeable Gireaux , Robert Grieg showed a vicious cynicism his butlers in film comedies rarely showed . But best , in some ways , is Joseph Calleia as the Inspector . Normally playing villains and sleaze-balls , Calleia had a chance here to be on the side of the law , and also to show a sympathetic understanding of Boyer's Pepe . He can tell that the man is hurting for his homeland , and while he is willing to use this to get him out of the Casbah he does respect Pepe's feelings . In the end he regrets his pursuit's conclusion . A very satisfactory conclusion to the film though .
" You're Better Now ! "	I hope that when you see this great Laurel & Hardy feature film the print has the actual concluding joke - a bit macabre but fitting as it is . As the film is usually shown today , the joke may be briefly glimpsed ( in some prints ) before the film ends . More about that later . BLOCK-HEADS has some claim to being the best of the final Laurel & Hardy / Hal Roach feature films ( A CHUMP AT OXFORD is it's closest competitor ) . In it Stan and Ollie begin in 1918 , as the men are about to go over the top from a trench in the last battle of the war . But Stan is ordered by the Captain to guard the trench , so Ollie goes out alone . We watch a brief , spartan montage showing 20 years passed and Stan is still in the trench . He has survived on cooked canned beans - and there is a mountain of cans on the side of the trench . As he is about to eat he hears a plane's motor approaching , and starts machine gunning the plane . The plane lands , and the aviator comes over angrily demanding what Stan is doing . When Stan explains he is fighting the war , the aviator laughs and tells him the war's been over for 20 years . Despite some questions about the truth of this ( " It better be true , or someone will get in trouble ! " , says Stan ) he leaves the trench . Ollie has become a henpecked husband to Minna Gombell , and they are planning to have their first wedding anniversary , when Ollie learns that Stan is still alive . He goes out to the old soldier's home where Stan currently is , and sees his friend sitting in a wheel chair , apparently with one leg . In one of the most touching moments of their joint film careers Ollie's facial expression is deeply saddened by his friend's loss . He sits down and chats with Stan ( who is glad to see him ) , and he starts wheeling him to his car - he'll take Stan home for dinner . Stan tells him " I'm better now ! " , and Ollie smilingly accepts this . But then another man comes and takes the wheelchair back ( over Ollie's temporary objections ) . A minute later , while carrying Stan he momentarily has to put Stan down . Stan manages to stand up - he has both legs after all - and Ollie suddenly realizes this when Stan is back in his arms . Ollie drops Stan . A moment later , in Ollie's car , he says with great frustration , " You're Better Now ! ! " BLOCK-HEADS has been called the ultimate expanding disaster film of Laurel & Hardy - a type of expanded version of their sound short HELPMATES from a few years earlier , where Stan is supposed to get Ollie's house ready after a wild party before Mrs . Hardy comes home . Instead he ruins Ollie's wardrobe ( Ollie ends up dressed up in a costume like a 19th Century Admiral ) and Stan cleans up the house - but burns it down accidentally . In BLOCK-HEADS Ollie lives in an apartment house , and Stan manages to wreck Ollie's car ( actually it's Minna Gombell's car ) and blows up Ollie's kitchen . He also smashes the marriage ( or appears to - Gombell is last seen headed for the old soldier's home to have them take Stan back ) . Stan is also responsible in part for a near confrontation between Ollie and his neighbor James Finleyson ( which almost ends up in a fist fight - but Jimmy still manages to clock Ollie in the end ) . But finally there is the problem of the Gilberts . Patricia Ellis and Billy Gilbert are the Gilberts , the next door neighbors of the Hardys . Billy Gilbert ( who had frequently popped up in Laurel & Hardy shorts like THE CHIMP , TOWED IN THE HOLE , and COUNTY HOSPITAL ) is a big game hunter who has just returned home . Gilbert is very jealous of his pretty wife , and she manages to get into the Hardy apartment innocently enough to help them clean up , but her clothes get ruined . They lend her some of Hardy's overly large pajamas , but Mrs . Hardy is in the apartment , and they have to sneak her out in a trunk . But Mr . Gilbert returns , and he starts sneering at Stan as a home wrecker . But shortly after he realizes there is a woman in the trunk , and he starts calling Ollie an " old dog " for putting one over his old lady - and then starts mentioning his own extra-marital activities . Mrs . Gilbert , hearing this , rises out of the suitcase and confronts her husband . But Billy is soon chasing Ollie and Stan with a shotgun . And he is firing it every now and then . Soon they are in the courtyard of the apartment house complex and he fires , and dozens of men jump out of the windows of the apartments ! Today that is the point the film ends . Most people do not mind , but there is a better end that exists . The last shot was to show Billy Gilbert sitting and reading in his parlor . We see stuffed animals all over the place - and finally Stan and Ollie's on the wall . Ollie's head turns towards Stan's and says " Here's another nice mess you've gotten me into . " , and Stan starts to cry . Interesting actual ending of a first rate comedy .
He Was the " Yankee Doodle Boy "	Unless you happen to catch a rare showing of THE PHANTOM PRESIDENT , you are not going to see any film that will bring you closer to that long gone Broadway phenomenon named George M . Cohan than this . Producer , Director , Dramatist , Actor , Composer , and super-patriot , he rewrote the American musical theater . If his successful productions are out of date today , the music survives to reawaken us every July 4th ( his big holiday ) . His success as a songwriter led the way to Gershwin , Porter , Rodgers ( and Hart and Hammerstein ) , Kern , and Youmans . YANKEE DOODLE DANDY is not a perfect biography of Cohan - he was still alive while it was being made , and would have vetoed the project mentioning his first failed marriage to Ethel Levey or his opposition to Actor's Equity . But as a valentine to his greatness as an entertainment phenomenon it remains great . Whole numbers from his LITTLE JOHNNY JONES ( " Yankee Doodle Dandy " and " Give My Regards To Broadway " ) and FORTY-FIVE MINUTES FROM Broadway ( " So Long Mary " ) are shown as they were produced . James Cagney ( who was a first rate song and dance man on Broadway ) studied THE PHANTOM PRESIDENT to know what were Cohan's singing and dancing style . His research and work paid off in this , his best musical performance and his only Oscar performance . Walter Huston and Rosemary DeCamp are splendid as his loving , but long suffering parents ( best scene for both is when Huston has to spank the young Cohan for blowing an important booking chance ) . Huston also has a moving moment when he gets as a birthday gift 50 % of George's business enterprises . Richard Whorf ( who was so sinister that same year in KEEPER OF THE FLAME ) was excellent as partner / friend Sam Harris . Jeanne Cagney is good as Cohan's sister Josie , and Joan Leslie wonderful as Mary Cohan ( the only wife of Cohan in the film , but historically his second wife ) . Also of note are George Tobias and Chester Clute as Dietz and Goff ( poor Goff ) and S . Z . Sakall as a backer who loves chorus girls . Walter Catlett as a conniving theater owner has a funny scene . Irene Manning as Fay Templeton is a perfectly snobbish star who actually finds Cohan has merit . Finally , catch Eddie Foy Jr . as his father , Cohan's rival and closest friend . That scene together was so good that it could have been continued as a short subject comedy . One minor point to bring out - it is mentioned that LITTLE JOHNNY JONES is based on a jockey named Tod Sloane . If you recall Johnny Jones was accused of throwing the English Derby , and he is cleared afterward when papers are found showing one Anskey was responsible . In actuality Sloane , the leading American jockey of the day , was disgraced in a similar situation when riding in the English Derby . In Sloane's case there was no sequel with an " Anskey " and it sent his career into a tailspin . Only in the last year was a biography written about Sloane's tragic fall from sports fame .
" You throw an olive upward and I end up sitting on my hat ! Why does that sound normal to me ? "	Because of its box office failure after one or two other films a bunch of " expert " movie house owners called Katherine Hepburn " Box Office Poison " on a notorious list in the late 1930s . Fred Astaire and Marlene Dietrich were also on that list . One would love to know what other " great " prognostications and viewpoints this bunch of yokels made over the years . Did they predict Dewey would beat Truman too ? Or that Sputnick proved the Russians would land on the moon first ? I only hope that they ended up being laughed into oblivion by their families and friends . For " Bringing Up Baby " was one of the funniest movies of the 1930s . It is not flawless - the Katherine Hepburn character is the supreme example of the spoiled madcap heiress of the genre of madcap comedies of the 1930s . And she certainly gives the viewers much to laugh at , such as her impossible readiness to steal objects from golf balls to automobiles , or to try to wake sleeping people up by throwing pebbles at a window , or trying to calm a leopard down from the roof by singing with Cary Grant , " I Can Give You Anything But Love " . In no other comedy she made is Hepburn so ditsy . But the behavior of Hepburn is the sole problem of the film . She does such a number of things to keep Grant under her control while she derails his marriage plans that she almost makes the viewers dislike her . But Grant is such a dud personality from the start of the film that one can understand why she has such an easy time pulling him around . Howard Hawks made several comedies with Grant , most notably " His Gal Friday " . But in two of them Grant plays men who each end up being a yo-yo for the women who love them . The other one is " I Was A Male War Bride " , where Hawks paired Grant with Anne Sheridan , and puts him through a series of humiliations that go all the way to the conclusion . Both are equally funny films , but both are set in their times , one a peacetime film the other a post-war comedy . But the conclusion of " Bringing Up Baby " is more memorable - when the life's work of Grant , the anthropologist , is shattered . The fall of the brontosaurus ( again caused by Hepburn ) is so famous that it was reused in " On The Town " ( early in that film ) when Jules Munshin knocks down a similar brontosaurus . Here we watch David Huxley ( Grant ) plans to get a million dollars for his museum and his plans to marry his assistant Alice Swallow ( Virginia Walker ) go down the tubes from his constant collisions with the easy going but determined Susan Vance ( Hepburn ) first on a golf course , then at a restaurant ( she causes him to fall by trying to catch an olive which he trips on - see the " summary line " ) , to her apartment ( where he meets her new pet leopard , " Baby " ) , to her shanghaiing him to Connecticut . In the end he has to wear a woman's robe ( shocking Hepburn's dowager aunt May Robson ) , pretend he is an insane big game hunter named Bone ( and get bored by tales of big game hunting from Charlie Ruggles ) , dig up a lot of the estate looking for a dinosaur tail bone , wrestle one leopard and release a second one , and deal with a somewhat confused town constable ( Walter Catlett in a lovely absent minded performance ) and an " understanding " psychiatrist ( Fritz Feld ) . The film works despite being really a series of loosely tied together events . They flow from one to another , but due to the standard of lunacy involved the chunks of the film remain in our memories rather than the connecting links . But those are truly golden chunks , and make the viewers simply want to see more . This film is a real keeper for any fan to want to watch .
One of these days I'm going to go gorilla hunting	The " screwball " comedies of the 1930s was an attempt to try to lift the depressed feelings of millions of Americans who were out of work and facing near starvation - and a collapse of optimism and belief in the American Dream . Frequently they showed the wealthy were eccentrics who were facing bankruptcy ( THREE CORNERED MOON ) or bored and looking for excitement by solving crimes ( THE MAD MISS MANTON , or THE THIN MAN ) , or trapped by their public persona into nearly ruinous scandals ( EASY LIVING ) . These comedies , at their best , remain very enjoyable . Of course there were clinkers ( for example , HE MARRIED HIS WIFE ) , but I always find pleasure in the best ones . MY MAN GODFREY is among the best , and curiously thoughtful . One person I know , listening to it , called it a " morality " play . William Powell is a hobo named Godfrey who is living in a " Hooverville " on Manhattan Island . There is a scavenger hunt going on for a charity , and a woman named Cordelia Bullock ( Gail Patrick ) and her boyfriend show up - they need a " forgotten man " to win the contest . Powell dislikes Patrick's snobby demanding nature and rejects her offer . Shortly her sister Irene Bullock ( Carole Lombard ) shows up , and Powell willingly goes with her ( she's a feather-head , but a nice one ) . After he goes to the hotel which is the center of the contest , he accepts a job offer from her . The Bullocks are a wealthy family on Fifth Avenue . Eugene Palette and Alice Brady are the parents . Since Brady has a protégé ( Mischa Auer as " Carlo " ) , Lombard feels that she should make Powell her protégé too . Powell finds that working for the Bullocks is difficult for three reasons . Lombard is falling for him , and he knows that socially a butler is not supposed to be the lover of an heiress ( sort of the reverse of the plot of SABRINA ) . Secondly Patrick is gunning for him , unwilling to forgive his snubbing her offer - and she is treacherous . Finally there is a background matter that might turn up : Godfrey is not poor by fate but by his choice - he's from a wealthy Boston family , but he is trying to prove himself as a worthy person and not a spoiled brat . There are great set pieces throughout the film : Auer's performance of what he does best - which is why Brady patronizes him - acting as a gorilla . Palette is pretty sensible , and he dislikes this leech . His comment about what he'd like to do to Carlo is in the " Summary Line " . There is also the mystery of the missing jewelry , and how it blows up in Patrick's conniving face . There is the business of how Powell's college roommate ( Alan Mowbray ) has to lie to explain how he lost " Godfrey's " services as a butler after a serious tiff ( except we never understand how the tiff developed to become serious ! ) . There is Grady Sutton's amazement to hear he has just proposed to Lombard . And there is Palette's friendly willingness to show Powell ( before he realizes he is the new butler ) his boxing abilities . A fable on materialist failures and proper use of wealth in a national crisis , MY MAN GODFREY may be set in the Depression , but it's meaning has never faded out of fashion . It remains a fine example of first rate movie making from the 1930s .
The Follow - Up To SVENGALI	When Michael Curtiz directed this odd ballet and horror film he presumably had the recent success of the John Barrymore - Marian Marsh film SVENGALI ( from George Du Maurier's TRILBY ) in mind . That story was based on a novel wherein a great singer is actually controlled ( by hypnosis ) by her impresario . Although Svengali's character in the novel was quite obnoxious , the film version softened it to make one realize he was in control of Trilby but loved her and could not be certain if she loved him back . In the end it turned out she did . The story of THE MAD GENIUS was similar - Donald Cook is a brilliant ballet dancer who was trained by impresario Barrymore , and the latter is determined to get his protégé the career he deserves - by all means necessary . This means derailing anything or anyone who Barrymore concludes will prevent this . Marsh is a female member of the ballet company that Cook is falling for , and Barrymore is willing to push her out of the company , and even turn her into a wealthy nobleman's mistress to keep Cook in line . The film actually works . In the background was a misunderstanding of the relationship between Diaghilev and Nijinski ( who many thought was that impresario's puppet ) . Here one realizes Barrymore is a man who is so hung up on the success of his adopted son that he does not stop even while he realizes he is doing harm to so many others . To perfect the boy's dancing ( and the company's ) he is willing to be the drug supplier to dance master Luis Alberni ( one of the first examples of cocaine use in movies ) . When not pimping for his wealthy aristocratic backer , he runs a tight ship on all the dancers and his factotum associate Charles Butterworth . But he is human . One of the funniest aspects of the film is how Barrymore picks up his own sexual partners from starry eyed young woman coming in to join the ballet company . He always uses the same line with them , and even the same hour the next day to visit his office ( three o'clock ) . Butterworth adds his bit too , as he tries constantly to interest Barrymore or anyone in a really bad ballet he's written ( Barrymore , who is happy and drunk when Butterworth finally corners him , slowly sobers up when hearing this idiotic story line , and ends up saying he never realized what an ass Butterworth really was ) . Finally there is a cameo that I find fascinating . This is the film wherein Boris Karloff ( for about one minute ) shares screen time with John Barrymore . They never did so again .
" Comence A - Dancin ' ! "	While Laurel & Hardy made several costume films , most were set in Europe ( BOHEMIAN GIRL , THE DEVIL'S BROTHER , SWISS MISS ) and only one was set in a past American History period : WAY OUT WEST , which with SONS OF THE DESERT and BABES IN TOYLAND represent the highpoint of the boys ' comic feature films . It is their only real Western ( PICK A STAR has a sequence where they are shooting a movie set in Mexico , but they were in another modern period in other parts of that film ) , and has usually been considered better than other major comedians ' westerns . While it is ( no doubt ) better than the Marx Brother's GO WEST , it is hard to be dismissive of the W . C . Fields / Mae West comedy MY LITTLE CHICKADEE ( any film where a lynch mob asks Fields if he has any last wishes , and he says 1 ) he wants to see Paris before he dies - but 2 ) Philadelphia will do ! - has to be first rate ! ) . The Martin and Lewis comedy PARDNERS has some nice moments in it too ( note the brief but telling moment when Lewis breaks his downtrodden son persona and shows a type of homicidal streak towards iron-willed momma Agnes Moorehead ) . The difference is that WAY OUT WEST is seamless in it's flow of events and humor . Like SONS OF THE DESERT , BABES IN TOYLAND , and BLOCKHEADS the events of the scenario don't seem forced ( let's face it - no matter how amusing that gorilla in SWISS MISS was , how many gorillas are likely to appear on rope bridges in the Alps ? ) . The boys are on a mission here - a gold miner who found a rich mine has died , but before dying he gave the boys a deed to his mine to give to his daughter . The daughter is Mary Roberts ( Rosina Lawrence ) who is working as a maid in the saloon owned by Mickey Finn ( Jimmy Finleyson ) , and occasionally helps prepare his lead singer and girlfriend Lola Marcel ( Sharon Lynn ) for the stage appearances . When Stan blurts out the reason for seeking out Mary to Finn , he passes off Lola as Mary . The boys ( after some irritating delays - deliciously bothering Finleyson and Lynn ) give them the deed . But then they discover the error and try to get the deed back . Earlier they had managed to anger the town's sheriff ( Stanley Field ) by annoying his wife ( Vivian Oakland ) in a stagecoach . Field doesn't want to hear their complaint against Finn , and they are run out of town . Eventually , however , the mistake is corrected ( to Finn's great discomfort ) and the boys and Mary head down the road presumably to develop her mine . This barely describes what stuff Laurel came up with . There was the spoof on Claudette Colbert's manner of stopping cars ( here stagecoaches ) in IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT . There are the musical numbers ( the soft shoe dance of Stan and Ollie to " Commence A - Dancin ' " , sung by the Avalon Boys ( including a young Chill Wills ) ) , and the later singing of " In the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia " ( sung delightfully by Ollie - Hardy had a good tenor voice - and then sung supposedly by Laurel using fake voices - one is Chill Wills ' until Stan's head is hit with a mallet , and then Rosina Lawrence's as Stan supposedly ends the song ) . There is the business here of Stan's incredible magic ability to turn his hand into a cigarette lighter , and how Ollie keeps trying to duplicate it until his hand becomes a torch briefly ( it is like the " earsie , eyesie , nosie " routine in THE DEVIL'S BROTHER , also bedeviling Ollie and Henry Armetta ) . There are bits with Finleyson , like discovering his cash register is always announcing one dollar sales , but nothing larger . He discovers that James Morton ( his bartender ) doesn't find it terrible , but very useful for his purposes ( Finn does one of his double-takes hearing this admission ) . And Hardy has his moments of dialog - addressing an annoyed Vivien Oakland in that stagecoach , he announces cheerfully , " Lots of weather we've had recently . " Finn has some good quick dialog too . To hide ( briefly ) that Mary is the maid , and not Lola , when Stan hears him seemingly calling the maid Mary , Finn turns around and laughingly says , " Mary Christmas ! " The final scene of the film also shows the boys ( and Ms Lawrence ) in song - singing " We're going to Dixie land ! " And we finally learn that Stan came from the South of London . With hardly a single wasted moment on film , WAY OUT WEST is a joyful comedy experience . If not the best comic western ever done , it has to be in the top ten comic westerns .
Laszlo's Play Makes It's Third Film Appearance	If you have been reading the last three reviews I did , this is the natural concluding review of the sequence . THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER , IN THE GOOD OLD SUMMERTIME , and SHE LOVES ME all were based ( in the central plot about two people at loggerheads in physical life , falling in love through anonymity in pen-pal letters ) on Miklos Laszlo's PERFUMERIE . They all had their differences in a secondary plot dealing with the jealousy of the owner of the store towards the hero ( his closest employee ) resulting in his firing the hero due to a serious mistake by the employer . This was jettisoned and altered in the middle film , but resumed in the Kander and Ebb musical of the 1970s ( made into a television version in 1978 ) . But that version actually gave the actual villain a parting shot in his last song , showing he was down , but not out , and would still find a way of getting an undeserved success . When Nora Ephron did her version of the play in this screenplay , the jealousy angle was dumped , and the concentration was on the business antagonism between the hero and heroine ( here Tom Hanks as Joe Fox , and Meg Ryan as Kathleen Kelly ) . Hanks and Ryan do not work at the same store as James Stewart and Margaret Sullivan or Van Johnson and Judy Garland did . Hanks works at a mega book store ( Fox Books ) like Barnes and Noble . Ryan runs a small neighborhood book store for children , called " The Shop Around The Corner " ( Hanks takes her to task for that name , saying it can't be claimed as a single corporate name ) . Fox Books is moving into the neighborhood that Ryans's store is in , and she fights it's irresistible push - in vain as it is . In the end not only is she the loser , but members of her staff get hired by Fox Books as well . There are other elements here that do not come out in the original version or the 1949 version . The protagonists don't write letters , but are sending e-mails to each other . Times are changing , and the discovery of a small notice in the newspaper's classified for a pen-pal is replaced by Ryan meeting Fox accidentally in surfing the internet and finding a chat room ( a scene we are told of , but never see ) . In the 1949 film , Garland was pursued ( if you will - somewhat weakly ) by Johnson's friend and fellow employee Buster Keaton . Johnson was linked ( by Garland ) to a female friend who was a violinist . Neither relationship was that strong or threatening to the eventual Johnson-Garland relationship . But for the first half of YOU'VE GOT MAIL , Ryan is living with a self-righteous newspaper columnist ( Greg Kinnear ) , and Hanks is living with a self-centered publisher ( Parker Posey ) . We barely knew the families of Sullivan and Garland ( we saw an aunt or two that they lived with ) . Here we know that Ryan's mother is dead , but her grandmother Birdie ( Jean Stapleton ) is alive and thriving . In fact we learn Birdie is rich due to a stock investment and that she once dated John Randolph , Hanks ' grandfather . In fact , we even learn that Birdie romanced one of the most interesting political figures of 20th Century Europe . Hanks ' family is developed too , beyond Stewart's or Johnson's ( or Ellis's for that matter ) . Besides grandfather Randolph ( about to remarry ) , we see Hanks ' father ( Dabney Coleman ) , who keeps running through wives and never finding the right mate . We also meet Hank's aunt and brother . The film worked well again , and just as the early pairs of couples ( Stewart and Sullivan , Johnson and Garland ) had good chemistry , so did Hanks and Ryan . This was their third film together ( people forget they did JOE AND THE VOLCANO first ) , and the second film ( after SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE ) with Ephron at the helm . With all the modernization and story changes , and character histories , and assaults on the concept of mega-stores ( check the scene where Hanks hears an inept salesman in the children's book section ) , Epron managed to show the old warhorse by Mr . Laszlo still had plenty of juice in it to go down well with the public . My guess is that like Lubitsch's original film it will end up a classic version of the story . My wonder is what will be the next version be like .
Alright Mr . DeMille , I'm ready for my close-up .	It is among the best and most tragic exit lines in film . And it also leads directly to the best conclusion ( I feel ) in movies in terms of proper cinematography : the clouding of the focus as Norma Desmond descends the staircase into her madness . Rarely does a film end so satisfactorily and perfectly . SUNSET BLVD . was not the first film to look at the uncertainties of cinematic success and fame . A STAR IS BORN had done so in the in 1937 . It showed how as a star is nurtured by the system to great fame , another prominent star descends into oblivion and death . So why ( if the story theme was not new ) was SUNSET BLVD . such a tremendous hit and classic from it's first appearance in 1950 ? It boiled down to this : the personal poison of the great fame of the silent screen star Norma was not mirrored precisely in the fall of say Norman Main ( although their two first names bear an uncanny resemblance ) . Norman had always had a drinking problem which he never controlled . Norma was not into that - she was always into a healthy physical lifestyle ( except for smoking ) , but the effect of her publicity and the fan mail pushed her egomania to great heights . It made her so egocentric that she can only think of the people around her in her immediate cycle as the greatest representatives of all those millions of unseen fans - the wonderful people out there in the dark . They are there for her adoration only . Norman Main , in comparison , did find a measure of happiness in Vicki Lester , whom he discovered and helped to find her true potential . He was more selfless , to the point ( as it turned out ) of self-destruction . Not really like Norma Desmond . To her people are there to serve Gods and Goddesses called stars . One might also notice that Joe Gillis is not Vicki Lester . Joe and Vicki were both ambitious , but Joe really wasn't as interested in Norma ( aside from giving him room , board , and a temporary job ) , as Vicki was in Norman . There was a mutual attraction there ( Norman was not incredibly older than Vicki , as opposed to Norma's older age compared to Joe's ) . Joe also had his girlfriend / collaborator Betty Schaeffer . Vicki had no other lover on the outside - it was only Norman . That is why , when he commits suicide , Vicki goes into seclusion . There is a triangular figure in SUNSET BLVD . for Norma , in her butler Max Von Mayerling . He had been her first director and husband , and he is also ( in his over-devotion to her ) feeding her ego by writing hundreds of fan letters to her to keep her emotionally happy . It is a sign of her insanity that she never notices that the letters are written by the same hand . Wilder had used Eric Von Stroheim in FIVE GRAVES TO CAIRO as Rommel , so he knew what it was like working with him . Supposedly when Von Stroheim was being directed by Billy Wilder he wanted to throw in various tics and sexual habits for Max ( like his carefully washing Norma's underclothes ) which Wilder managed to push aside . Von Stroheim's performance ( one of his greatest ) was not harmed by these cuts , although one wonders what his performance would have seemed like if they had been retained . But by reducing the neurotic behavior of Max ( to just his pathetic need to be near Norma to support her ) it keeps us concentrating on Norma's psychosis - where it should be . Norma is the driving force to the end , pulling the wires that manipulate Max , Joe , Betty , even ( out of a sense of pity ) Cecil B . DeMille and his production staff ( example : the light man " Hogeye " ) . Even with the " waxwork " friends who crop up for cards , Norma seems to be in control ( they all congregate to see her - the richest among them ) . Even with people who are supposedly independent ( the funeral home people who cater to her burying her pet monkey ; the salesman on commission who urges Joe to buy the vicuña coat ) she manages to keep this control . She is the central sun / " Star " in this galaxy - and cannot brook any deviation . The rejection of the ungrateful Joe can only be appeased physically by his death , and emotionally by her mind clouding that failure and it's aftermath from her memory . From the start of the film , with all her egocentricity at work , only a psychic slap in the face was missing to complete the tragedy . Then she was finally ready for that close-up .
This time Judy doesn't have to borrow a barn to put on a show !	It was her last MGM musical , and one of her best . But she was really troublesome in the making of it , so MGM fired her and her career ( which included at least two more great performances ) never recovered in the movies . That is how SUMMER STOCK is recalled today - the film that wrote " finish " to Judy Garland's film stardom at MGM . But SUMMER STOCK is also the film that gave her her last chance to appear opposite Gene Kelly and to play a story line that she was familiar with . For here Judy returns to the story line of the musicals she made in the early 1940s with Mickey Rooney , regarding " putting on the show " . The difference is that she and Mickey and the others were teenagers ( or supposedly teenagers ) showing up the dubious grown-ups . Here it is grown-ups putting on a show for an out-of-town preview in a small town . Judy is living in a New England town , where her family has old , old roots ( at one point we learn her great great grandfather set up an anti-theater law in 1698 ! ) . She and her sister , Gloria DeHaven , own a farm . Judy has been courted , and is engaged , to Eddie Bracken , the son of the town banker Ray Collins . Bracken is his typical weak type , with eyeglasses and hay fever . Collins is typically fatherly , but a bit of a bully to his son ( not for any bad reasons ) . He looks forward to the marriage as a way of uniting the two oldest families of the area . And he even does Garland a favor , giving her a new tractor for her farm at cost . DeHaven has always been the pampered younger daughter . She has been dating Kelly and invites him and the cast of his musical review production to put it on in the barn of her farm . The musical not only has Kelly as director , producer , and star , but also has Phil Silvers and Carleton Carpenter as his assistants ( in Silvers ' case , supposed assistant as he's a walking disaster area ) , and also been lucky enough to get a famous leading man named Keith ( Hans Conreid , effective in his brief part but all too brief ) . They descend on the farm and Garland and her cook and helper Marjorie Main are uncertain about what exactly to do . Collins and Bracken are not too helpful . In fact their parochial attitude to theater people is very hostile . As the film progresses Garland slowly gets dragged into the production , especially as DeHaven's interest flags . In the meantime the relationship of Bracken and Garland starts cracking seriously as he gets suspicious of the intentions of Kelly towards his intended . The numbers are pretty good , particularly the songs " Howdy Neighbor " , " You Wonderful You " , " Heavenly Music " , and the last minute show stopper , " Get Happy ! " Oddly enough , in the discussions I see on this thread , nobody notes the ridiculous tune that Conreid ( it's not his voice ) and DeHaven sing " Alone on a Lonely Island " . It is done in such a way to spoof the stiff , overly rich voice of Conreid's " Heath " . As it does not show up in the final production it probably was only meant for that character . It is too bad that SUMMER STOCK was her last MGM film . . . but at least Judy left on a high note .
Romanticism v . Reality	When this film came out in 1988 the criticism that followed was that while it had some great special effects , it was too long and too expensive , and did not make sense . But THE ADVENTURES OF BARON MUNCHAUSEN , while certainly very expensive , may be among the best film adaptations and adoptions of a well known fictional classic into a major motion picture . The stories it is based on are Raspe's 1780 collection of tall tales of that great adventurer and lover Baron Hieronymous Von Munchausen . The best known tale is how the Baron travels hundreds of miles back and forth during a battle by riding on top of cannon balls ( as he does in the film ) and how he visits the King and Queen of the Moon . The book made Baron Von Munchausen's name a synonym for liar ( albeit a colorful liar ) . It was glorified by one edition in the 19th Century with illustrations by the great Gustave Dore , that was used by Terry Gilliam for his inspiration in this filmI might add that this was not the first time the character popped up on film . There was a Czech film THE ADVENTURES OF BARON MUNCHASEN that was made in the 1950s by the same creators of THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF JULES VERNE . And in the early 1930s an " all star " comedy was made in Hollywood called MEET THE BARON , based on a popular radio show of that time called BARON MUNCHAUSEN , with a comic named Jack Pearl as the Baron . Although it had the Three Stooges , Jimmy Durante , and Edna Mae Oliver in it , it also had Pearl . A bit more bearable as a dialog comic and " zany " than the abominable Joe Penner , Pearl gave a catch line that gained national attention in that period . When his garrulous count was questioned by his suspicious trapped listener the Baron would say , " Was you dere Charley ? " , which would shut-up his questioner . But Gilliam is probing the reason for tall tales . A town in middle Europe is under serious siege in the middle 18th Century by the Turks . It is under constant bombardment . There is only one open theater working , and they intend to put on a dramatization on the career of Baron Munchausen . But they are finding that this dramatization is only being begrudgingly allowed by the local authorities ( led by Jonathan Pryce , as an obnoxious diplomat and civil servant ) . Pryce does not believe in fantasy , and feels that the people should see only reality . Of course , as the film progresses one sees that Pryce's idea of reality is bloody and deadly to most people , and will only glorify the " peacemakers " ( a role he intends for himself ) . As the play is put on by the father of the film's small heroine , Sally Salt ( Sarah Polley ) , a man appears who denounces the story as false . He is Baron Von Munchausen ( John Neville ) . He dismisses the actors ( to the anger of the cast and the audience ) but he manages to quell their anger by talking about why it was not a real version of his career . Soon he and Sally take a look at the deteriorating situation on the battlefield . They construct a balloon , and take off . And the film then follows their adventures around the world , and on the moon , and even with Vulcan ( Oliver Reed ) and his wife ( Uma Thurmond ) . I refrain from going into detail but the part dealing with the King and Queen of the Moon ( Robin Williams and Valentina Cortese ) is very funny and exciting . In the end Munchausen finds his four old servants ( Eric Idle , Charley McKeown , Winston Dennis , Jack Purvis ) and returns to the town to save it . The film has a Chinese box type of construction . Surprise ending follows surprise ending building to the climax - a peaceful one but one that is shattering none the less . For after watching the destruction of the Turkis forces we learn that the Baron has been simply telling his tales to the audience , and they have been spellbound . Pryce shows up with a military bodyguard , berating the old windbag for wasting the audience's time with all this romantic claptrap . Munchausen points out the firing has stopped . Everyone notices ( including an amazed and troubled Pryce - he has missed his chance of gaining fame by ending the war himself ) . The audience rushes to the gates , and finds the enemy has abandoned the siege . Romanticism , and it's calming effects - it's powers of giving our dreams and wishes wing to soar , has defeated the reality that Pryce offered . And the film ends . I like it . It is saying that in this rotten world there is a seriously place for imagination to comfort and sustain our spirits . The film actually was one of the best philosophical lessons in movie history . Being by Gilliam there are numerous Monty Python touches in it ( including his pal Idle's appearances as the fastest man in the world - trying to outrun a bullet ) . Note too the " artistic " Turkish Sultan , who is composing an opera called " The Torturer's Apprentice " , which includes a device torturing a half dozen prisoners to yell " Ow " and " Ooh " in time . The performances were good , including Pryce's priggish bureaucrat , but best of all was Neville . Aside from his appearance as Sherlock Holmes in the film A STUDY IN TERROR , and his John Churchill in the television series THE FIRST CHURCHILLS , Neville never had a major lead role ( though plenty of good supporting parts : Lord Alfred " Bosie " Douglas to Robert Morley's Oscar Wilde in the film of that name , for example ) . He certainly made the most of this one , proving to be a wise old man , but having moments of serious doubt and personal sadness . In all it was a terrific performance in a remarkable film .
In the Shadows of Klaus Fuchs and Nunn May	SEVEN DAYS TO NOON was the sort of topical film that could appear in Europe , but not in the United States in the years after World War II . There were American films about the atomic bombing at Hiroshima and Nagasaki , but the story of atomic spies and ethical doubts were not in the cards for Hollywood from 1946 to about 1953 . The idea of a scientist taking over and using one of the bombs against our government was not favored in the McCarthy period , and would have ended some film careers . Lesser " errors " destroyed careers like John Garfield , Canada Lee , Gale Sondergaard , J . Edward Bromberg . There errors were in membership with left wing groups or ( in some cases ) involvement in pro-Soviet movies . But a film about a scientist turning against the country ? Nobody here had the guts to do it . It was not the same in Europe - oddly enough . There were really far more serious reasons for the Europeans to fear Communist aggression , and only two of the countries ( England and France ) had the capabilities of building atomic weapons of their own against the Soviet Union . But the Europeans were more willing to talk about the dangers of the weapons , and of radioactivity . After all , if there was a war between Stalin's Russia and the U . S . , it would be across Europe . England had two examples of atomic spying that came out in the late 1940s : the cases of Alan Nunn May and Klaus Fuchs , both of whom gave atomic and nuclear secrets to Russia . May is on record of never having regretted doing this , in the interest ( as he put it ) of " international peace " . At the time that these two cases came up the West was unaware of the ring of spies around Kim Philby at Cambridge . With Nunn May and Fuchs in mind can see the germination of the story that becomes SEVEN DAYS TO NOON . A scientist with impeccable credentials ( winner of some prizes , and once a leading figure at the Cavendish Labs ) Professor John Willingdon ( Barry Johns ) has disappeared from a high level science think tank . At the same time a letter , signed by Willingdon , has been sent to the Prime Minister , Arthur Lytton ( Ronald Adam ) threatening that unless England announces unilateral disarmament in seven days London will be destroyed by an atomic bomb . The letter is sent to Chief Inspector Folland of Scotland Yard ( Andre Morell ) , who finds that Willingdon's think tank is missing an atomic bomb that is small enough to fit in a small Gladstone bag . Because the British made this film the sense of reality is much stronger that a Hollywood production might have made it in that period . Anti-Communist hysteria would have made the police act more like James Bond against the enemy here than was necessary to get the story across . In fact , the reality of the film , and the fact that the actors are first rate character performers but not superstars ( no Guinness or Sim or Donat here ) the film keeps the audience believing in the plausibility of the situation . What happens is two stories neatly meshing , One is the careful police procedural ( later assisted by the military ) in tracking down Willingdon and his bomb . The other is following Willingdon , and realizing that this man has had a nervous collapse due to the pressures of dealing with the ethics of creating hideous death for his country's defense . For each of the bombs will cause tens of thousands of deaths due to radioactive poisoning , not to mention the hideous damage to Earth itself . All this was known by 1950 - it was a badly kept secret , for films of the doomed survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki showed people with skin slowly falling off due to the attack . Willingdon could have been made into a cartoon villain - a traitor who is doing this on the behest of the Soviets . But he's not - he is a humanitarian who has to make a stand to fight nuclear proliferation . Compare him to the upper crust , hypocritical politician who was the villain ( a few years after ) in the British film HIGH TREASON , and you can see the difference . Efforts are made to show Willingdon is a loving husband and father ( Sheila Manningham is his daughter Ann , and Marie Ney his wife ) , and that he even tries to get some guidance from the local Vicar ( Wyndham Goldie ) . The script does not make the subject matter easy to decide on for the audience . The film slowly gets claustrophobic as a net grows around Willingdon - a net he is clever enough to keep ripping apart by such things as shaving his mustache and losing his mackintosh coat . His assistant Steven Lane ( Hugh Cross ) and his daughter are brought to London to help find the man , and hopefully get control of the bomb before it blows up . And we see a cross-section of the public , most notably a landlady ( Joan Hickson ) and a former music hall performer ( Olive Sloane ) and the army men , typified by angry and tired Sgt . Victor Maddern , who at the tail end moves on his own to settle matters . It holds up well - the issues on the use of atomic and nuclear weapons ( and even atomic or nuclear power ) remain to bedevil to this day . As pointed out in another recent review of the film the idea of someone traveling around with a " dirty " atomic bomb in an American or European or Asiatic city is ( unfortunately ) all too real a possibility . In the end of the film Professor Willingdon does get a personal answer to his query . But it is not an answer that really is satisfying to anyone .
Now a trifle more bittersweet than expected	In 1962 the subject matter of this episode was funny . It still is , but there is a sense of sadness - only one year later the episode would never have been aired . . . or even written . The plot of this episode was that the Police Department has chosen Captain Block's Precinct for a special detail . President John Kennedy is coming to New York City , and needs two police officers to accompany his car ( as drivers and guards ) . So the officers chosen are Gunther Toody ( Joe E . Ross ) and Francis Muldoon ( Fred Gwynne ) . Block ( Paul Reed ) is not really happy at the selection , but he calls in the two to inform them , and then finds the real flaw of the selection . Muldoon is rendered weak - kneed by the prospect of being in charge of the President's safety . He has long been a fan and admirer of Kennedy , and he can't imagine having his hero's life in his hands . Block and Toody try to calm him down , and he does make an effort . And all this is happening before the arrival of the one person who can put the kibosh on the entire assignment : Simon Oakland . Oakland was a favorite character actor of mine . Usually playing villains or negative types ( like his police lieutenant in WEST SIDE STORY ) he did have a gift for comedy . In particular his recurring role as the harried editor to Darren McGavin on KOLCHAK : THE NIGHT STALKER , he tried to control what he thought was his ace reporter's flights of fancy as best he could - and to little avail . He has the same approach here . His Secret Service man , Mr . Cordner , is all business , and serious . Yet he can't understand why Muldoon is acting so nervous . Muldoon is not apparently happy about driving Kennedy . He is really reluctant to do so . At one point , he even asks if Muldoon likes the President . And Toody is not helping his friend and partner - he tries to reduce the entire issue by dismissing the importance of their would-be passenger . " The President ! The President ! " , he says to an astounded Cordner , " You make it sound so important ! " They pass the first session with Cordner barely . Then they try relieving Muldoon of his anxiety by using tranquilizers . Naturally too many of these are popped by Muldoon . . . with interesting results . It actually is a funny episode to the conclusion . But given the events of November 22 , 1963 . . . it's a little odd to see it now .
