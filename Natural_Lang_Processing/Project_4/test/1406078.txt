Let's hope there's not a Black Knight 2 . . . . . . . . .	How much did they pay Martin Lawrence to do this comedy ? What is truly surprising is to see an actor of the magnitude of Tom Wilkinson get dragged into this mess ! ( He must have had to buy an estate in the English countryside , or maybe he had to pay the taxes to Her Majesty's treasury . . ) The only thing one could think about is that this project must have sounded great within the confines of the Polo Lounge , or wherever they met to decide to do this picture . This is by far , one of the worst films of this year ! Let's hope that either the business breakfast , lunch , or dinner was better than what this travesty turned out to be .
The baby sitter	One wonders about the wisdom of the people behind this project . Why bother to remake a a superior film ? This makes a plea for leaving things the way they were and concentrate in making original movies with better screen plays and leave alone the originals . The problem with this version of Simon West's version is the screen play of Jake Wade Hall . The original was co-written by Steve Feke and the director of the 1979 movie , Fred Walton . The premise in which the film is based doesn't make sense from the start . We are given a sort of prologue in which the carnival-like area is juxtaposed with the lonely house next to it in which a phone rings but there is no one at the other end and we hear screams and then see the police arriving at the scene of the crime . Jill Johnson , the young heroine of this tale , is a girl that appears not to be savvy in ways of dealing with the pervert that is obviously calling the Mandrakis residence . That brings another point , if the Mandrakis have a live-in housekeeper , why bother to engage a young girl to take care of the two children she doesn't even see until half way through the film ? Things get sillier with the arrival of Tiffany , the girl that supposedly stole Jill's love interest away from her . Oh well , the only interest in the movie is the beautiful house . We have liked Camilla Belle in other films , especially " The Ballad of Jack and Rose " , but she has nothing to do in this misconceived film . Better luck next time , Ms . Belle .
Harry Potter is a bore !	I know I'm probably the only one that didn't care for this film , but I thought it was plain boring . The adaptation of the book is just OK and the acting is average . Frankly it's a pity to see all the great English actors in this film totally wasted and relegated to play second fiddle . The effects are very well done , but it's such a conventional treatment of the books that I kept checking my watch a few times to see when was it going to be over . It's very curious that hardly any of the young people in the audience didn't laugh at all . This Harry Potter is very heavy handed and it should have emphasized the fun and could have used a few lighter moments . I was greatly disappointed given the hype in the media , which I'm sure has Ms . Rowling , Mr . Columbus and the rest of the people responsible for this mess laughing all the way to the bank !
Chronicle of boredom in Catalonia	One wonders how director Marc Recha's films make it to Cannes . Evidently someone thinks he must be the Enfant Terrible of Catalonian films , or something like that , at the expense of real talented directors that don't get the chance to go and make the scene in Cannes in May . At any rate , this film makes no sense . It's as slow as the other film I saw by this " genius " before . This came as part of the yearly festival of Spanish Films at the Walter Reade . We are led to believe the cream of the crop is being shown , but after seeing this " masterpiece " about boredom and strange lives in a small town , we shall be more careful in selecting anything directed by this man in the near future .
Entertaining the troops	Franco is dying and most of the military men were panicking because of the uncertain future under the monarchy . The story centers around a military base in North Africa where the peace is abruptly interrupted by the arrival of a theater troupe from the mainland . These military men , being isolated from women from home , suddenly become excited by the prospect of having so many beautiful show business girls among their midst . The colonel in charge , becomes infatuated with Gloria , a woman of a certain age , who is the principal attraction of the visiting thespians . His aide , Pecinas , also finds in Chichi , a woman to share his sexual fantasies . Chichi wants to try the local dope and is instrumental for Pecinas to help her with a plan of her own . The film is a silly comedy that doesn't go anywhere . In fact , for a comedy that takes place in 1975 , the drug culture was something that was not everywhere , as it is these days . It doesn't make sense to have Chichi asking Pecinas for dope the first moment they meet . As a comedy , the film has occasional laughs and relies on the coarse way most people talk in the movie .
Hamlet or Robin Hood ?	" Best Men " probably looked better as a film project when all the people behind it were discussing how to bring it to the screen at a meeting at the Polo Lounge , perhaps . Having admired Tamra Davis films before , most notably , " Guncrazy " , we decided to take a look . A sad mistake . This is a movie that has taken its ideas from other , better made films . The result is a mess . The film doesn't work as a black comedy . We don't believe for a moment there are people like this anywhere , but obviously , it seems to be the case . The talents of some of the actors in " Best Men " are totally wasted by a screen play that is as phony as a three dollar bill . The idea of watching the charismatic Drew Barrymore goes out the window because she is only seen in a couple of scenes . The DVD should be a good present to give for Christmas to all those people on your s # t list . It certainly would make a statement !
Not ecstatic !	Mariano Barroso , the director of this film doesn't break any new ground with it . Perhaps because the screen play he wrote with Joaquin Oristell doesn't hold any surprises for the viewer . No doubt there might have been good ideas as a project , but as it plays on the screen , it loses its viewers early on . Naturally , the only interest in watching this Spanish feature were Javier Bardem and Federico Luppi , two of the most interesting actors working in the cinema these days . But alas , nothing makes much sense , or really grabs the viewer's attention . The mercurial theater director , Daniel , played by Mr . Luppi fares much better than Bardem , whose appearance will not add anything to his fine work in better films than this . Watch it at your own risk .
Adam and Eve-Lyn	Neil LaButte is a provocative film director . This film based on the play of the same title played better on the stage than on the screen . Mr . LaButte has changed strategy here by giving the strong role of his tale to Evelyn . Evelyn could stand for Eve enticing the man she has chosen to play with his mind in the story , Adam , an absolute idiot in the hands of this Eve . This Evelyn cast her spell on this man just to prove a point in her thesis . This is a role reversal for Mr . LaButte since he has told the story with a man's point of view before . Adam plays the role of the handicapped secretary of Mr . LaButte's In the Company of Men , in that he is ridiculed by the all powerful Evelyn and reduced to nothing in the process . Don't ever mess around with a powerful woman who wants to prove a point ! This Evelyn doesn't mince words , or fool around , she goes for the jugular . There are a lot of symbolism hidden in the plot in the form of theater plays presented at , get this , Mercy College . Medea , Hedda Gabler , even Pygmalion are in the background . They reinforce the idea that whatever Eve-lyn wants , Eve-lyn will get . She shows absolutely no mercy on her victims . The story is static at best . It drags for 90something minutes . A lot of spectators left the screening I attended . They just didn't get it , and oh , most , if not , were men . Rachel Weisz makes an attractive Evelyn . Paul Rudd is properly bewitched , bothered and bewildered by his lady Eve . Gretchen Mol's role is somewhat of a puzzle . Finally , Frederick Weller plays the confused dude who is made a fool by Evelyn too and ends up losing his sweetheart as well . Perhaps opening the play in a different way would have helped this film because it just feels as though is filmed theater .
Gabriel / Gabrielle	The Blue Parrot , a night club in Nice , serves as the backdrop for most of the action of this French film co-written and directed by Thierry Klifa . Christopher Thompson is credited as the other writer . Mr . Thompson , an actor himself , has been generous to all the players in the film . After all , everyone has a chance to be in front of the camera for quite some time . Unfortunately , to this humble viewer the whole thing did not ring true from start to finish . Perhaps the mere idea of watching Claude Brasseur , a distinguished actor , play a kind of Victor / Victoria singing " On the Sunny Side of the Street " in drag was simply appalling . If one can believe that , then there is nothing wrong with this film . Gerard Lanvin is seen as Nicky , who sired two children by two different wives . It's hard to believe he could get Catherine Deneuve's , or Emmanuelle Beart's attention , even on a sober day . Geraldind Pailhas , Miou-Miou , and Valerie Lamercier fare better in their roles . There seems to be some confusion as to where this film was shot . IMDb credits the location to Marseilles , but looking closely , it's apparent Nice was the actual site for the action , unless the final shot of the Promenade des Anglais was just thrown in to make it appear that way .
Spy exchange gone bad	Nicholas Meyer is a good writer as shown in the many screen plays , and novels , he has given us . As a director , he has had some success and failures , as it's the case of his " Company Business " , which he wrote for the screen and directed . The film has a fatal casting problem in Mikhail Barysnikov , who was a great dancer , but alas , as an actor , one would advise him to stick to his day job . As a result , the film never achieves the momentum that is hinted at the start . Gene Hackman , a superb actor , doesn't do as well under Mr . Meyer's direction . As a matter of fact , he appears to be too old for the part and there is no chemistry between him and Mr . Barysnikov , making the film drag . The others in the cast do what they can , but nothing can save this movie . On the plus side , we are taken to interesting locales , but by the time we arrive at those destinations we couldn't care less where we are , or if it's Friday , we must be in taking a tour of the Eiffel Tower in Paris .
Desire	The basic problem of this film lies in the screen play Angeles Caso wrote . The direction by Gerardo Vera , doesn't allow much to happen , as the viewer is one step ahead of him in this predictable movie set in Spain in 1945 . As WWII is ending , Pablo , an Argentine Nazi sympathizer , living in Madrid , has the right contacts to prepare the way for some of the German higher ups to relocate in his country . With the help of Alina , he is trying to smuggle one important person of the fallen regime with his wife to his own country . He enlists his own mother , Clarita , to act as the go-between and secure new identities . Into this mix Elvira enters . She is a beautiful woman who has fallen into poverty . His communist father , a distinguished doctor , was executed by Franco's followers . Now , living in poverty , with a husband in prison , she is hired to work in Pablo's apartment as a housekeeper . Pablo likes her from the start . The film doesn't show any surprises . We know where it's going ; nothing makes much sense . The acting is not too convincing . Partly Gerardo Vera's direction must be the key in understanding what went wrong . Leonor Watling's Elvira doesn't register any emotions . Leonardo Sbaraglia's Pablo is too bland . Cecilia Roth , an otherwise good actress , appears as Alina , a lesbian , who likes Elvira . Other famous faces in the cast , Rosa Maria Sarda , Norma Aleandro , Ernesto Alterio , Emilio Gutierrez Caba . Watch it at your own risk .
Hotel Esperanza	Alberto Sciamma's " Jericho Mansions " is a strange film that hides a secret we are not going to be told until the end . This is a story of a building super , who is evidently slow , or mentally challenged . The film is mildly engrossing and it shows a director whose sensibilities seem to be rooted in European film making . At the center of the story we have Leonard Grey , who we realize early on has a mental problem . The landlady , Lily Melnick is a horrible woman who seems to get pleasure in berating her employee . We wonder , why not fire him ? Well , that's not possible because we discover toward the end the nightmare Leonard has gone through in his life and how the truth has eluded him all the years he was under Mrs . Melnick's employment . James Caan makes a rare appearance in this indie production . He is good as the super that seems to be perplexed by all what's going on around him . Genevive Bujold , rarely seen these days , also makes an interesting landlady from hell . The supporting cast does good work under Mr . Sciamma's direction , notably Jennifer Tilly and Maribel Verdu . " Jericho Mansions " , while not breaking new ground , is different in the way the story is presented and developed .
The ghosts from the past	" Rag and Bone " was shown recently on cable . The promise of having been inspired by something written by Ann Rice , we decided to take a look . This film has a TV pilot written all over it . Robert Lieberman , has worked basically for television . The film doesn't show anything new , or break any new ground on the genre . The main annoying point is the thundering and lightning effect we see and feel , whenever anything supernatural is about to occur in the action . Instead of enhancing the point of view , it appears to work against what we are watching . The idea of a priest joining the New Orleans Police Department , is preposterous , at best , but we go along with the story . The conflict of interests , alone , is something that defies all logic , but one gives it the benefit of the doubt . The acting is adequate , although , as Tony Moran , the cop , Dean Cain , seems out of his depth . Robert Patrick , on the other hand gives a more assured performance as Sgt . Ryan . Based on what was presented , it was clear why this would be series didn't make it .
Boo hoo ! Watch out for the Tooth Fairy and don ' forget your flashlight !	I caught this film recently on cable . Not having seen it , I had no idea what it was all about . As a film of the horror genre , there are good moments , especially at the beginning of the film , where the idea of what's to come takes place . Director Jonathan Liebesman creates the right atmosphere in the little town of Darkness Falls . The idea of a curse in the town makes for an interesting concept , although sometimes , the execution of the idea is not as brilliant on screen , as it might have been on the page of the scenario . The cast is attractive and they deliver , which speaks a lot about the director having a tight rein on things . Watch this film with someone , as it might frighten the living ' daylights ' out of you !
Songfest	This MGM film showcases the great Mario Lanza , whose untimely death came right after this film was completed . It's a vehicle for the star , who had one of the most powerful tenor voices in the cinema . As such , " For the First Time " is an excuse to present its star in different European settings in a picture that is more of a travelogue than a musical . Rudolph Mate directed with an eye for the backgrounds being shown . We are taken to that magical island of Capri , then to Salzburg , among other places that go by too quickly . The DVD we watched had a faded look , and one can only guess the original copy had glorious colors . Mario Lanza plays an opera singer who goes to Capri to stay away from the scandal he caused at the Vienna Opera house for not showing for a performance , when in reality , he was outside entertaining the people that couldn't get inside . In Capri he meets sweet Christa , who happens to be deaf . They fall in love and she will not marry him unless she can hear him . Naturally , like in all fairy tales , everything comes true and everyone is happy at the end . Mario Lanza has some good moments in the film . He sings arias from Pagliacci , Aida and Othelo , as well as the theme song , " Come prima " , in his usual style . Johanna Von Koczian is seen as Christa , the sweet girl who conquers Tonio Costa's heart . Kurt Kasznar plays Tonio's agent . This is a happy film without any pretensions . It's not Mr . Lanza's best film , but for all his fans it will be something to savor .
The Bates Motel	Gus Van Sant has distinguished himself in his career in the American cinema . Mr . Van Sant has been a man that is attracted to risky projects as proved by his films . That said , one can't imagine what made him undertake the direction of a definitive work such as " Psycho " , which doesn't need another interpretation . The film was based on Robert Bloch's novel which was adapted brilliantly for the screen by Joseph Stefano . Alfred Hitchcock , an original director , seemed to be the natural choice to direct the screen treatment . In fact , this film falls into a category that would seem easy to imitate , but no one can improve in what was already a masterpiece . This 1998 film follows its model closely , but somehow , it never jells . In a way , we are all prejudiced against any remake of anything , but this was sacrilege . Most of the original is presented following its model and perhaps it would have made a better film if instead of copying the Hitchcock movie , it would have been done differently . Then , at least , one would have gone along with that new rethinking of the novel , and new adaptation , but instead the viewer keeps comparing it against the excellent film Mr . Hitchcock left us . We had avoided watching this version , but thinking the original was going to be shown on a cable channel , it turned out to be the new one . Obviously , despite the harsh criticism , Gus Van Sant got over this bad decision and came back with other films worthy of his talent .
No deal at Madonna Street !	Louis Malle lived in the USA during the last part of his life . If there was anyone with enough talent to bring " Crackers " to the screen , it was him . Unfortunately , sometimes , even with the best intentions , no doubt , a great man produces a film that is well beneath himself . Of course , anyone is entitled to a mistake , but if there was anything wrong with this project it seems to be the Jeffrey Alan Fiskin's screen treatment of the classic Mario Monicelli film " Big Deal at Madonna Street " . The cast Mr . Malle assembled for the film is a first rate one , just by looking at the names in it . Donald Sutherland , Jack Warden , Sean Penn , Christine Baranski and the rest have enough experience to show much better than what comes out on the screen . Let's just remember Mr . Malle for his greatness , and not by this misguided effort .
Little orphan Danny	June Allyson and Van Johnson were paired by their studio in several pictures . Once MGM type-casted someone , or Hollywood , for that matter , an actor , or an actress , went to appear in other films performing , basically , the same role . Which seems to be the case with " The Bride Goes Wild " , directed by Norman Taurog , a veteran film director who always made pleasant movies . The premise in this film is just an excuse for presenting all these players in a comedy typical of the times . After all , the times were hopeful and happy right after the WWII and a semblance of normalcy was the intention . This is a silly comedy that wouldn't have been made today . In the other comment submitted to this forum , the contributor links what appears to be a gay subtext to all one sees in the movie , and in many aspects , it makes sense . Hollywood was notorious for being a gigantic closet where gays were safely kept even though everyone seemed to realize what really was going on . June Allyson and Van Johnson are given the same roles to play . Butch Jenkins , a child actor , appears as Danny , the orphan that Greg Rawlings , the Van Johnson character , is passing as his own son . Arlene Dahl doesn't have much to do . Hume Cronyn , Una Merkel and Richard Derr play the supporting roles . Watch the film as a curiosity as long as you don't have any expectations .
A mind is a terrible thing to lose . . .	If one were to go along with Hollywood and the TV industry , there are more amnesiac people than what we thought were possible . This is a ploy that writers use a lot to present a story that could not be logically explained otherwise . I didn't see this film when it was originally released but caught it on cable . Renny Harlin , its director , is a product of Hollywood whose work includes more interesting tales than this one . The film is not helped by Shane Black unintelligible film treatment . Yes , we all understand that it's an action flick , but please , give us more credit to realize that most of what it's presented on the screen bears no resemblance with anything actual , or dreamt . The best thing in the film : Samuel L . Jackson . He is an actor that always delivers . As far as Geena Davis , I kept thinking about the Uma Thurman character in the Kill Bill saga . Obviously , this film came out before , so maybe it was an inspiration for Quentin Tarantino , who knows ? It's incredible that what Charlie / Samantha and Mitch went through , at the end of the movie they're in one piece and laughing all the way to the bank . No doubt they must have earned a bundle for appearing in this film as well as to what happens to them in it . Hooray for Hollywood ! With the exception of Craig Bierko , the rest of the actors are totally wasted . Brian Cox and David Morse don't have anything to do .
Texans in Paris	For being an MGM musical , " Rich , Young , and Pretty " , has a strange look to it . Gone are the glossy backgrounds , those fabulous costumes , and great songs that were the trade mark of anything that came out of the studio . Yet , the film with its silly plot and predictable situations , is not a total failure . Thanks to Norman Taurog's direction , there are some good things to be found in the picture . It helps to explain Jane Powell , one of the most radiant musical stars of the era , was pregnant at the time this film went into production . It also explains why Ms . Powell , who had a beautiful figure , was dressed in the unflattering costumes like the one blue number she wears the first night she goes to La Parisienne with Andre Milan . To make matters worse , her blue dress is complimented with some sort of Dutch cap that makes this girl from Texas look she is Amish ! The film is made better because of the presence of Danielle Darrieux , one of the best actresses from France and who could have had a great career in Hollywood , if it weren't for the way she hated the way movies were made here . Ms . Darrieux plays Marie Devarone , the star of the exclusive night club . Danielle Darrieux's Marie shows an exquisite woman who knew a thing , or two , about how to charm an audience , be it in the night club , or otherwise . The supporting cast is not bad . Vic Damone made his debut in the movies here . Wendell Corey , Una Merkel , Marcel Dalio , and the rest do what they can with the material they were given to play . The film is harmless enough and the allure of Jane Powell and Danielle Darrieux in the same movie is enough for making us watch it .
Ocean cruise to Puerto Rico	" Ship Ahoy " was probably made in order to showcase MGM talent . The film is a fun trip on an ocean liner on its way to San Juan , Puerto Rico , at the time in which the country was involved in WWII . This was typical fare for the studios , which gave the movie going public light weight entertainment as a distraction during those difficult times the country was living . The beautiful Eleanor Powell is seen at her best in some musical numbers where she clearly shows us she was a dancer to be reckoned with . Red Skelton is also seen in a straight part with not too much clowning , as he pursues the beautiful Ms . Powell on the ship that is bringing them to Puerto Rico . The irresistible Bert Lahr has good opportunities in the film to show he was a funny man . Also Virginia Grey is seen as a fun girl who is not fooled by anyone . There are good musical numbers featuring Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra , in which one sees , among others , the amazing Buddy Rich , who has a few solos with Mr . Dorsey and Ms . Powell . A young Frank Sinatra appears also as the lead singer of the band , backed by the Pied Pipers . This is a nostalgic trip that should be savored by fans of this genre , which MGM totally controlled .
Short cuts	An interesting concept , presenting several shorts to make a full length feature . The tone of most of the vignettes is an ironic one . Viewed as a whole , the stories go from interesting to just OK . " Bangers " , directed by Andrew Upton , shows a woman going into insanity . Cate Blanchett is amazing in giving life to this " lost soul " . Even though it is one of the shortest stories , it is one of the ones that really make an impact . " A Whole New Day " , by William Garcia , is priceless . A man awakes on the floor of an empty apartment . He and his wife have a tempestuous relationship . His only way of communication is his cell phone . He uses to call his wife , who is an unhappy woman , made even sorer by his disappearance . When a young woman comes to check the empty apartment , that she evidently wants to rent , the man goes ballistic . How dares she to even think about it . The last scene reveals the secret . James Gandolfini is perfect as the loud mouth . " Standing Room Only " makes a lot of sense . A few hopefuls decide to come early to claim their places in the back of the theater to see the hit play . There are only eight possible fortunate people admitted . An old lady with her dog makes an appearance to stand in line . She would be the last one to be admitted , but little does she know the others will ask for the eight tickets available . At the end of the performance , as the cast comes out of the stage door , a revelation occurs . Michael Gambon , Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio , Hugh Jackman , Joanna Lumley , are seen in this fun story directed by Deborra-Lee Furness , who is Mrs . Jackman in real life . There is another story about a supermarket that is not given credit by IMDb . In it , Ileana Douglas , Daryl Hannah and Jeff Goldblum , among others are brought together . This one was the weakest story since it relies on name dropping and inside jokes . Col Spector's " New Year's Eve " was perhaps the longest of the stories . It shows the guests of a party at a private home in London . Kira Knightly is at the center of the story as a precocious young woman interested in talking to an older guest . Tom Stappard's " Euston Road " about a con man has its moments . Paul Bethany makes the best out of his character .
The preppy	Peter Farrelly wrote the novel in which this film is based . This was a change of pace for Peter and his brother Bobby , coming right after their hit " There's Something About Mary " . Although they entrusted the direction to Michael Corrente , their presence looms large in the background . The film succeeds in presenting characters one can identify with . Timothy Dunphy is a teen ager who has grown with his younger , handicapped brother , Jackie , in a small town in Rhode Island . Timothy's future is uncertain , at best . Coming from a working family , his prospects for higher education are nil . Like other young men in his area , he is aimless and the guys he pals around with , are not exactly college material . When Timothy is granted admission at the preppy Cornhill Academy , his life takes a turn for the better . At first , Timothy fights the rigid standards of the place . He doesn't like the atmosphere , but he is completely won by a pretty co-ed , Jane Weston , a rich girl , way out of his league . It's easy to see the combination will see trouble along the way . The best trait about Timothy Dunphy is his honesty that comes into play right after Jane is caught with some boys smoking pot , and her ambition to go to Brown University is doubtful . Timothy does the right thing in going to the admissions dean at Brown to speak on behalf of the innocent Jane , who didn't bring her fate upon herself . Shawn Hatosy , an actor who is always effective no matter what part he is playing , makes the most out of his Timothy . Surprising also , is Alec Baldwin , seen as the older Dunphy in a sincere performance . Jon Abrahams is Drugs Delaney . Amy Smart makes a valuable contribution to the film as Jane Weston . The teaming of Michael Corrente and the Farrelly Brothers show a winning combination in an enjoyable film that will stay in one's memory for quite some time .
All the news fit to print	Joel Schumacher seems a strange choice for directing the film , before actually taking a look at the finished product . While the logical choice might have been someone like Neil Jordan , Mr . Schumacher makes the most of it with the material at hand . As usual , he is a director that likes to take chances , as he shows here . This film came and went without being noticed in this country . Some movies go away quickly , which was the case with " Vernica Guerin " . Having just seen it in DVD format , it deserved much better than oblivion from the distributing studio , or the many people deprived of seeing it when it first was released . Veronica Guerin was a courageous woman who was not afraid for her life , even though there are a couple of instances that could have caused her death , before her actual demise . We see the events on a flashback , as the movie starts with the tragic events of Ms . Guerin's death . We watch her pursuing the people that had no scruples unloading drugs in impoverish areas of Ireland and laughing all the way to the bank with the millions they made illegally . Cate Blanchett does a great job in her portrayal of Ms . Guerin . Not knowing what the real person was like , Ms . Blanchett bears an uncanny resemblance to the real woman . Cieran Hands , as John , the informer , is also quite good . Having seen him on the stage , he does an excellent turn as this evil man . Finally , Gerard McSorley is also what one would expect his John Gilligan to be ; he makes Gilligan appear as the vermin he was . Brenda Fricker , as Veronica's mother , has only a few dignified moments on camera . The rest of the Irish actors were extremely good in contributing to create the right atmosphere for the movie . This movie emphasizes the danger of drugs and the unscrupulous people that get rich out of the misery of others .
Queer eye for the straight couple	" Confetti " is a sort of mockumentary that tries to do what Christopher Guest has been doing for years with better results . Director Debbie Isitt shows she has the know how to present her mildly funny comedy that involves a contest sponsored by a magazine with three finalist couples , one of whom will win the prize and the exposure such events usually bring . After the three couples are selected , the finalist are the couple that want to have the Hollywood musical themed wedding . The second couple elects to see a tennis themed ceremony and finally , there are the nudists , who insists they want to be married in the buff . Confetti , the magazine , engages a pair of gay wedding planners to put some sense into this enterprise . Little do Archie and Gregory realize what they are about to get into . Archie and Gregory are a gay duo that love to dress alike and they have to deal with all the drama behind the scenes in the contest . Ms . Isitt gets some good results out of the large cast . Best of all are Vincent Franklin and Jason Watkins , the wedding planners , without a doubt . These two are fun to watch at all times . Martin Freeman has some good moments as Matt . Stephen Mangan and Meredith McNeill are seen as the tennis couple . Robert Webb and Olivia Colman play the nudists . The fun finale compensates for some dull moments within the film . Let's hope Ms . Isitt comes out with a funnier picture on her next project .
Becoming a man	The idea of young boy arriving at the age where he is considered a man is celebrated traditionally by Jews . In this age of consumerism , most 13 year old boys are given lavish feasts in which expense seems to be no object by parents that have the means to do so . The feasts evidently must have a theme . When we first meet the people in this mildly funny movie , they are in the middle of a bar mitzvah with a Titanic theme . We watch as the young boy arrives in a replica of a ship posing as Leonardo DeCaprio and even colliding with an iceberg . This party cost about half a million dollars to Arnie Stein , a Hollywood type that can well afford it . As Benjamin's own bar mitzvah approaches , his parents , Adam and Joanne Fiedler must make a decision about how big a party they want , and what theme will their son choose . Benjamin , who appears more grounded than his Hollywood agent's father , only wants to have his paternal grandfather , a person he has never met , at the party . Benjamin plays a trick by sending Irwin Fidler an invitation with a date of two weeks before the actual event . Little prepares him for the character his grandfather turns out to be . Irwin , who left his family when Adam at a young age , comes to town with his New Age-type girlfriend , who goes by the name of Saved Feather , to stay at his son's mansion . This brings back bad emotions Adam has kept bottled inside him . He can't forgive his father for what he , and his mother Rose , had to endure . The old man is a changed man and his love for his newly found family serves to get Adam's forgiveness . Scott Marshall , the director , who is the son of Garry Marshall , follows in his own father's foot steps and finds his way into this ethnic comedy that shows how people must compete with one another to show who is the one giving the best and most elaborate party , something that probably the children feel too overwhelmed , as it's the case with Benjamin . The film points out to basic problems in our society in which we must outdo our friends , and even our own family , in order to prove we are superior , or just to prove we have more money than they . Garry Marshall steals the show with his Irwin . Mr . Marshall knows comedy well and knows what buttons to press to put the audience in his pockets . Doris Roberts is tremendously appealing as Rose , the wife that has had to endure a lot after Irwin left her . Jeremy Piven and Jamie Gertz are perfect as the parents facing a dilemma about to go broke in order to keep up with the Steins . Daryl Sabara is an excellent actor who shows he knows what he is doing . Daryl Hannah has some good moments as the evolved New Ager . Larry Miller and Richard Benjamin are seen in supporting roles . Much has been said about this comedy as far as being targeted to Jews , but in our experience , not being Jewish , we found it speaks a universal language and people of other backgrounds will enjoy it as well .
Rebels with a cause	This small Italian film was an interesting find when it was shown in a cable channel . The movie takes aim at Italian health services that appears to be in disarray , the same way as in other countries , ours being not an exception . One can relate to the way the group of patients at a men's ward feel dealing with the bureaucracies of the system . Dr . Sorvino , who is in charge of the ward , has a to share a lot of the guilt in the way the men rebel and decide to take justice in their hands in order to prove their point . What they do is to create a feast and enjoy themselves because most of them have been deprived of most things that as part of their health regimen . The film , directed by Vincenzo Terraciano moves at a quick pace , no small accomplishment for the team involved in this project . The cast is excellent and play with conviction . Antonio Catania , Antonio Petrocelli , Giovanni Esposito , Franco Iavaroni do a wonderful job . A fun comedy to watch as it will no doubt please lovers of the genre .
War games	" Taps " presents a twist in the way students in a military academy of certain reputation perceive how honor is , above all , the thing to live for , even over all other qualities a man could possess . The teachings of this military institution , molding young men 12 to 18 years old , have a profound effect , especially in the intense Brian Moreland , who is a clear favorite of the academy director , General Bache . Harold Becker directed " Taps " , which is based on a novel by Devery Freeman . The action of the film takes place in the fictional Bunker Hill Military Academy , that has just been sold to private investors who want transform the site into condominiums . With a history of having molded young minds during its distinguished history , Gen . Bache is horrified by the mere thought of losing the academy and the young people he has helped to involve in the rich life of the military . After a tragic incident that involves the killing of a townie , Bache suffers a heart attack , leaving the academy in the hands of people that are seen trying to undermine the fallen leader . Brian Moreland , the serious minded young man , takes it into his own hands to take care of what he thinks would be Gen . Bache's reaction in saving the school by getting the rest of the students left at the academy to hold it hostage and not give in to the upcoming changes , or to other people who don't have the same purpose in mind . Timothy Hutton is about the best thing going for the film . This young actor brought the right amount of seriousness , courage and valor to the role . This film is basically the big screen debut for Sean Penn and Tom Cruise , who went to build spectacular careers of their own . George C . Scott , another excellent actor is seen as Gen . Bache , but unfortunately , he doesn't have much to do and only appears in the opening sequences . Other familiar faces in the cast , Billy Van Zandt , Giancarlo Esposito . " Taps " is a film that shows how some young minds will act when they follow to the letter things they have learned in theory in the classroom . It also recognizes how honor could get a well meaning person to do things that he will regret later on and how it can cause harm to innocent young men that go along with these new leaders .
Revenge	Rocky Malloy is a man that has served five years of his life in jail for a crime he didn't commit . We watch as he gets out of the train in Los Angeles ' Union Station , where the newspaper man recognizes him from the front page story . A detective , and the man who gave Rocky his alibi , Delong , follow him until they meet . Rocky , while grateful to the guy that got him out of jail , but he knows Delong has an ulterior motive and wants to get to part of the money . Rocky and Delong end up in a seedy trailer park . The beautiful Nancy happens to live there as well . Nancy , whose husband is tied up to Rocky , always liked Rocky . Being so close , they begin to get reacquainted . Delong , who likes Darlene , another woman in the trailer park , shacks up with Rocky . When someone shoots in Rocky's direction on the first night at the trailer park , he figures he has to pay a visit to an old friend so he can collect some of the money that's due to him . This is the beginning for Rocky to clear his name , even if it will take him to situations he didn't count on . " Cry Danger " , directed by Robert Parrish , is a minor film of the crime genre , not a film noir , as some comments indicate , and which Robert Maxwell , in his excellent commentary on this forum , analyzes objectively . This film was basically shot during the daytime . Sure , there are night scenes , but those menacing shadows are missing , also there are no tricky camera angles that distinguishes the noir genre from crime films . Which doesn't mean the film doesn't have its own merits . Dick Powell , a versatile man , was at the end of his film career . As Rocky , he doesn't show the ease he showed in the much better " Murder My Sweet " , but still he holds our attention . His contribution to the film pays off . Richard Erdman , who is seen as Delong , makes a good appearance . Rhonda Fleming plays Nancy , the woman who is the key to the mystery at the center of the story . William Conrad plays Louie Castro . Regis Toomey is seen as the detective Gus Cobb , who realizes Rocky is clean . Jean Porter has a couple of good moments as the party girl living in the trailer park . " Cry Danger " while not a fine example of the crime film , gives us a look at how Los Angeles looked like thanks to the good black and white photography by Joseph Biroc . The director , Robert Parrish , gets good ensemble playing from his cast .
The miracle maker	Leo Tolstoy's story was adapted with great style by Vittorio and Paolo Tviani , with the help of Tonino Guerra , an excellent writer on his own , and a man that has been connected with wonderful movies in his native Italy . This is a story told by the Tavianis with extreme care in magnificent locations in their usual way that pays a lot of attention to detail and the beauty of the Italian landscape . The musical score by Nicola Piovani , one of their usual collaborators , contribute to make the film a joy when we listen to the atmospheric music . Cinematographer Giuseppe Lanci captures with precision the gorgeous scenery around L'Aquila and the region into images that leave the viewer breathless . The story is a strange one . When Sergio , the young man from humble origins , gets the attention of Charles III of Naples attention , he doesn't even suspect of the deceit he is made a part of . The beautiful Cristina reveals a secret that will be pivotal in Sergio's life . In horror , he flees that glamorous life at the court and becomes a priest . He wants to be no ordinary priest , he wants to go to a remote area to become a monk . It's at that location that he is discovered because of having performed a miracle . The solitude he is seeking intrudes in his life and the final blow arrives in the form of a disturbed young woman who has more than a cure in mind . The noble Sergio decides to go back to the world he left behind because he realizes he can't stay in a place where is no longer where he wants to be . Julian Sands is perfect as Sergio the mystical man . Natassja Kinski plays Cristina . Charlotte Gainsbourg makes a great appearance as the disturbed Matilda . Patricia Millaret , Margarita Lozano , and the rest of the crew make the film a joy to watch . The Taviani brothers should be seen more often because their films are always so beautifully crafted and leave their grateful fans awaiting eagerly for the next film .
Lou " The Looper "	Bud Abbot and Lou Costello were an amazing comic team who endeared themselves to their fans with the kind of humor they projected ; theirs was the kind of good fun with a lot of sight gags that made them one of the favorite duo in the movies for quite a while . Universal , their studio , decided to showcased them in a series of movies that involved the " monsters " in its roster . This film is not one of those , but because of the usage of the amazing visual effects employed in using the visual effects in the " Invisible Man " , it became a winner from the start . This was one of the best Abbot and Costello's best movies . Both do excellent work under the direction of Charles Lamont . Arthur Franz , who is not " seen " enough is good as Tommy , the man accused of a crime he didn't commit . Sheldon Leonard is one of the gangsters that are manipulating the boxing matches . Nancy Guild and Adele Jergens are welcome additions to the movie . Best of all are the boxing scenes involving Lou Costello as the amazing new boxer , Lou , " The Looper " , who goes to beat Rocky , his better equipped opponent with a little help of his invisible friend .
Three men , two women , a dog and a horse . . . .	Unexpected things are seen happening all over the Iberian peninsula . In Spain , Jose , a school teacher , sees a flock of starlings flying overhead ; the birds seem to follow him . Joaquim , who has been fishing , returns home and throws a stone to the sea , and instead of sinking , it is seen jumping over the water . Pedro , a pharmacist , senses how the earth trembles . Joana tries to erase a line on the earth , but it keeps reappearing . All of these characters plus Maria , are drawn together as these phenomena is playing a big part in their world . Maria , who has a small farm , is the only one who has her feet on the ground and acts as a steady influence . From Portugal to Spain , the five new friends embark in a journey of discovery as they try to comprehend what is going on . Supposedly , the Iberian peninsula will crash against the Azores islands as Iberia is moving southward . Upon reaching the Pyrinees , the group finds out they have been separated by the rest of Europe and that France really has never existed ! George Sluizer's take on the Jose Samarango's enigmatic novel presents the viewer with a lot of ideas . The mere idea of the separation of the Iberian peninsula is preposterous , but in Samarango's view , he might feel they are all alone , or a land surrounded by water from all sides . Federico Luppi is Pedro , an older man whose life is drawing to a close . Mr . Luppi , one of the best actors working in Spanish cinema makes an impression with this enigmatic man . Iciar Bollain , is Maria . Gabino Diego , Ana Padrao and Daogo Infante , are seen as the other members of the wandering quintet . The film is full of symbolism that will be lost to anyone viewing the film as entertainment . Mr . Samarago is showing us how myths and superstitions can take us in a different direction . Mr . Sluizer directed with an eye for detail in presenting this story .
The prodigal daughter	After an absence of many years , Tieta , who is now in her forties , returns to Santa Ana as a rich woman , the envy of the town . Tieta has a mysterious aura about her , that no one , even her father and sister , can't imagine where her wealth comes from . Of course , having been married to a wealthy man might have been one scenario , but there are many hints pointing about what the nature of her " business " is in Sao Paolo . The truth will not be revealed until the end , when Tieta , who has grown restless in the small town , decides to go back where she belongs . The novel by the great Jorge Amado gets a tepid adaptation by director Carlos Diegues . This is his third movie based by the director of Jorge Amado's novels . Diegues was more successful with his earlier films , " Dona Flor e Seus Dois Maridos " and " Gabriela , Cravo e Canela " , using the master story teller's texts . In all these films he has been lucky enough to entice the gorgeous Sonia Braga to participate in them . In fact , " Tieta do Agreste " kept reminding us of Frederich Durrenmatt's " The Visit " because in both a rich woman , who has been wronged in the past , come home to deal with the town and the people that were cruel to them , but that's where all the similarities end . In the German version , Karla deals with her past in a vengeful way , whereas in the Brazil of Jorge Amado , Tieta has a different approach . Sonia Braga's Tieta is full of fire , and for being in her forties , at the time she made the film , she shows quite a figure as the sultry creature who discovers a few things about herself , her family , and the town in which she was banished from by her heartless father . When she needed compassion , Tieta , got none . Her revenge is that she became rich and now she is in a position to help the backward Northeast town to get the electricity it badly needs . In the process , she falls in love with a younger man who betrays her . Tieta deals with her pious sister who only cares for the money she can get for herself and her son . Carlos Diegues got excellent performances from this talented cast . Marilia Pera , who plays Perpetua , Tieta's sister makes an excellent contribution to the film . Claudia Abreu , is another good actress that makes a good appearance in the film as Leonora , Tieta's step-daughter . The rest , Chico Anysis , Zeze Notta , Leon Gomes , among others , make a great contribution . We read recently that Ms . Braga had returned home from her prolonged stay in the U . S . , as she felt Hollywood , in general , had not been too kind to her lately . Ms . Braga deserves vehicles like " Tieta do Agreste " in which to shine . One could only hope her collaborations with Brazilian directors like Carlos Diegues will produce many more happy collaborations for our benefit .
Dressed to kill !	Perhaps I was expecting more from the documentary . Don't get me wrong , it captures the era and the craziness of the time , but sometimes it goes flat . A little more gay wit should have helped here . The directors have captured the idea behind the Cockettes in their heyday in San Francisco . Unfortunately , behind the happy facade of the parties , the theatre performances , we never get to really know most of the people who created the scene . The main character , and the " mother " of the Cockettes , Hibiscus , is an enigma . He's obviously so high on LSD and other drugs of the period to make any sense at all . Hisbiscus did have a vision , but carrying it to the stage was another story . Most of the skits kind of fall flat . I guess that in order to have appreciated the group at the Palace Theatre in San Francisco in its prime would have required tons of acid to view what went onstage as probably Hibiscus conceived it . The people that survived the Cockettes talk to the camara and tells us what it was like . It's great seeing the survivors as they look now and they looked then . Director John Waters is very effective in telling us his part of the story . The fabulous Devine , who only appears briefly in the film is a welcome distraction since she was the queen of all queens ! The Cockettes were way ahead of their time . When you see today's drag queens , they pale in comparison to that group which were probably the idea for most of the ones around today . Go see it and enjoy a bygone time that will never be able to capture again .
Missing mother	Holly Parker , a beautiful woman , is married to an up and coming politician with a bright future ahead of him . Holly , who is bored with her husband being away from home so much , becomes the lover of Phil Benton , a playboy , who wants her for himself . Holly , realizes her error and goes to break up with Phil , but a terrible accident happens where he ends falling to his own death in his apartment . Thanks to her conniving mother-in-law , who realizes she's a liability for her son's political career , Holly is given a choice she can't refuse , a new identity and money , in exchange for her supposed death by drowning . What follows is Holly's adventure as a single woman who misses her son terribly , but one that knows she can't go back to her old life . An aristocratic pianist , Christian Torben , wants Holly , but she can't commit to his life style , and what follows is her own descent to hell when she drowns her sorrows in absinthe , a potent drink she loves . She ends up in Mexico where the scheming Don Sullivan discovers who she really is ; he tries to blackmail her , but she is determined not to have her identity revealed to her former husband , or the son she loved more than anything else . The final section of the movie is a court trial in which , her own son , Clayton Anderson Jr . , is an assistant D . A . assigned to defend her . During the trial Clayton Anderson Sr . and his mother come to see the young man in action , but they can't connect this defeated woman to Holly . Holly gets to know the identity of her young lawyer at the end . This melodrama was a vehicle for Lana Turner , who saw in it a great opportunity in which to excel . Directed by David Lowell Rich , it follows the star from a glamorous beginning to a tragic end . The only problem was that Ms . Turner's co-star , Constance Bennett , looked as young as her own daughter-in-law in the early scenes . As Neil Doyle has pointed out in his commentary , Ms . Bennett , a veteran actress , had undergone plastic surgery herself , making her look better than the star . The other major flaw of this version is one of credibility . Even though Holly is supposed to have aged with her heavy drinking , she looks about the same , so it's a surprise when the old Mrs . Anderson herself , who is in court all the time can't even recognize Holly , or for that matter , Old Clayton himself doesn't seem to know this woman was his beloved wife . But that's the stuff that makes this type of story what they are . " Madame X " is what it is : a tear jerker at its best . They don't come any better than this , so don't see it without the tissues !
Dreams or nightmares ?	I didn't get a chance to see this film in its theatrical debut because it disappeared very quickly from the local screens . I recently caught it in DVD form . Judging by comments I had heard , I was expecting to see something that was either bad , or not up to par with other Brian DePalma's work . While it is not a remarkable piece of film making , it still holds one's interest ; it is impossible to forget , as its images stay with the viewer . First of all , I would question the choice of Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as the leading lady of the film . She is a breathtaking beauty , much too gorgeous for the part ; her acting hurts the character she plays . She projects raw sexuality whenever we see her in risque poses , but somehow these scenes in which she appears as a sex obsessed woman , don't ring true . The first sequence when Ms Romijn-Stamos is watching " Double Jeopardy " on television , is a key to what will come later . This is a story that appears to be something at one level , while having nothing to do with what one thinks , at all . It would have helped enormously , in one's humble opinion , that maybe another writer would have given a different twist to the story , as one cannot believe for a moment that the parents of the grieving Laure can confuse her with another person , even though it's the same actress and she's obviously wearing a wig . Antonio Banderas ' papparazzo fares better in the logical department . He is used by Ms Romijn-Stamos in more ways than one . Mr . DePalma has been kind to Mr . Banderas , whose choice of film roles is an enigma . Mr . DePalma's take on the Cannes film festival and Paris opens the film as he obviously loves spectacle and the city and takes pains to show it to the viewer in all its splendor . One would only have wished for a better plotted scenario , but otherwise , this is an elegant DePalma for all to savor .
They are watching us	I was curious about this film , which I watched in DVD format . The film is based on a book by Javier Garcia Sanchez , " Los Otros " , which by the way , it's the title of a better known film , " The Others " , by Alejandro Amenabar . What I still don't know is whether Amenabar was inspired on this novel , or as the IMDb page indicates , he wrote his own screen play . Directed by Norberto Lopez Amado , this film came out after the more commercially successful Amenabar's movie . It's strange to have two movies about more or less the same theme filmed by two totally different directors , giving also two different accounts . If you haven't seen the movie , stop reading right here . " Nos Miran " is a horror story . It starts in a flashback when we see a group of children playing in a railroad yard . Young Juan loses a dare and must lie flat on his back while an incoming train goes over him . At the same time , his young sister disappears in mysterious circumstances . The story goes forward as we watch a grown up Juan , now married to Julia , with two children of his own , a boy , and a girl . Juan works for the police department where he is given the task of solving the mystery surrounding the disappearance of a wealthy man . In pursuit of this goal , Juan discovers a link to the case when he is referred to go to an insane asylum to try to talk to the police detective that was involved with the case , originally , and now is a lunatic . The only thing he gets out of this person is : " They're watching us " . This is a Gothic tale where reality and the perception of life in other dimensions blend to give a spooky feeling that yes , we are in reality being watched . But is the director referring to an abstract idea , or is he giving his own input in why people in his own country disappeared because of political turmoil ? Knowing that Spanish directors , in general , love to have their own input about how they feel about their country , one wonders if the " disappeared ones " are the ones that either had to go away for fear of their lives , or are they the ghost of the " disappeared " in the civil conflict ? Although the film has a vague ending , it creates an atmosphere of mystery and menace lurking behind everything in Juan's house . We don't ever know what really happened with Juan . All we know is that he has been wounded in a leg , but that is not the reason for his demise . Carmelo Gomez does his best work , in one's humble opinion , in this movie . His performance is multi layered . He expresses his confusion and his fear in a way that he hasn't done before . Either he responded to the material , or to the director , or he liked what he is doing here . Iciar Bollain , has nothing to do in the movie . The veteran Margarita Lozano is also totally wasted , as she stays away from the mystery that is at the center of the action in her own house . The children , Manuel Lozano and Carolina Petterson , are good in their portrayal of Alex and Laura .
The old camera	The idea to gather 40 recognized film directors to shoot a mini film of less than a minute , or what would have been the format the Lumiere brothers used in their revolutionary camera , seems a great idea in paper . Unfortunately , what comes out is an uneven film where some of the short films hold our interest and some others that don't go anywhere . What must have been an interesting idea doesn't translate to brilliant film making in the finished product . This documentary is for fans of the medium , but will not be of any interest to a casual viewer . Some of the most enjoyable ones are the ones by David Lynch , Helma Sanders , Claude Lelouch , Jaco Van Dormael , and Bigas Luna , just to mention a few . The rest , hold some interest , but don't quite add anything new to the idea behind the project .
Apocalypse now	We watch a family arriving at a cottage in the country . We are not given any idea of what is going on . Are these people here for a leisurely week-end , or do they live in this house ? Nothing seems to be wrong until they enter the house and find it occupied by a man wielding a rifle , his wife , and children . We are taken aback because nothing had prepared us for the violence about to happen . When the arriving man questions the invaders about what are they doing in his house , the other answers by shooting him . The exploding violence is too much as we look to the wife's who gets her face splattered with her husband's blood , as he is killed . Next thing we see is the mother , Anne , and the two distraught children , Eva , and Ben , walking aimlessly through a devastated land with only a bicycle and the clothes on their backs . Every place they turn asking for help turns them down . Along the way they encounter a teen ager , that like them , is trying to find a safe haven . He tells them of the possibility of a train that passes nearby . When the train arrives , it goes by without stopping , adding to the group's anxiety . The other thing the young man tells them is to go to a railway depot in that area where they might find help . At the depot , more chaos is encountered as things are completely out of control . The place is run by Koslowski , a man who runs everything with an iron fist . Sexual favors are expected in order to get to the little provisions that come by . Anne and her children face an uncertain future among these people that might also die . The oppressive atmosphere weighs heavily on the children . Ben , the young boy disappears toward the fire over the rail tracks in the distance . We watch , in horror , as he takes off his clothes and appears to be considering jumping into the flames , but he is saved by one of the men from the depot . That last vision seems to be key to the puzzle one has watched throughout the film in that the fire will cleanse and it can be seen as a ray of hope . Michael Haneke , an Austrian director who works in France , is a man that doesn't like to adorn his films with frivolous distractions . Take this film , for example , there is no music in the background . The bleak atmosphere is never explained . Could it be war ? Could it be a catastrophic event that makes people run away from the cities looking for peace in the country ? Mr . Haneke doesn't explain anything , and yet , there are different hints what all we seeing is a man made nightmare . In spite of all the tragedy one sees in the film , the viewer stays glued to the screen as he tries to understand and grasp all what is going on and to make sense of this puzzle by analyzing all the parts before making an intelligent decision as to what really happened . Isabelle Huppert , is seen in one of the most difficult roles she has done in her career . Her Anne is a confused woman who has never done anything for herself and has to face a reality she can't escape from . Anais Demoustier plays Eva , the teen aged daughter and Lucas Biscombe is Ben , the young son . Hakim Taleb appears as the young man who guides Anne and her children to the railway depot . Olivier Gourmet , an excellent actor , doesn't have much to do in the film . Michael Haneke created a disturbing film that serves as a warning call for tragedies beyond all human control .
Outsourcing the dirty work	Calvin Dexter , a lawyer , is a man whose life has been marked by tragedy . When his only daughter is killed by a greasy boyfriend , he leaps into action . Cal doesn't wait for justice , he deals with the injustices committed against him . He is a Viet Nam veteran , part of a special force , that were trained for risky missions . As such , he has had the experience to deal with whatever comes his way . When Senator Stephen Edwards asks him to look into the disappearance of his son in Bosnia , where the young man has gone on a humanitarian mission , he finds that the man who was responsible for what happened to the boy is no other than the evil Zoran Zilic , a sanguinary man , responsible for much of the atrocities during the war in that part of the world . Cal decides to track down this paid assassin , but little does he know our own government is involved in the usage and protection of this scum bag , now hiding in South Africa . CIA director , Paul Devereaux , upon knowing how Dexter has found out about the war criminal , sends his henchman Frank McBride to eliminate Cal Dexter for him . Little does this corrupt government official realize the former Viet Nam veteran is ahead of all the evil forces and how he will avenge the murdered youth . The film , which was made for television , is based on a Frederick Forsyth novel . Director Robert Markowitz , working on the screen treatment by Alan Sharp delivers a taut action movie . This is by no means an original story , as we have seen before how corrupt public servants can be behind vile acts of violence in the name of democracy . " Avenger " was tailor-made for Sam Elliott . His Cal Dexter shows this actor at his best . We have always thought Mr . Elliott was a great character actor that could have been given more opportunities in which to shine . This film seems to prove he can deliver . James Cromwell plays the heartless director of the CIA with verve . Timothy Hutton is seen as the gofer for the head of the spy agency . David Hyman appears as Zilic . This television movie is action filled for fans of this movie genre .
The trip to Spain	Carol , the young girl at the center of the story , is transplanted to a foreign land , Spain , at the height of the Civil War conflict in the late 30s . For this girl , everything is new , in it's foreignness . The war and her father are her constant worries , while she has to immerse herself in a provincial culture that is years behind what she has in New York . Imanol Uribe directs this film by the numbers . Carol's family is obviously divided , while Carol's mother is married to someone that is an air force pilot with the leftist faction , the rest of the family's sympathies are with the Franco and the fascists that won the conflict . The story adds nothing to what has already been told , much better , but it's an easy film to watch . Northern Spain's magnificent landscape is shown . Don't expect a lot of action since most of what happens revolves around Carol and the young boys she befriends . Clara Lago plays Carol with sincerity and innocence . Maria Barranco is Carol's mother Aurora , the one that went away to America . Rosa Maria Sarda is Maruja , the teacher who befriends Carol . Carmelo Gomez , plays Alfonso , the man that Aurora left behind when she left for America . This actor , who usually has lead roles in most Spanish films , doesn't have anything to do , as he remains an enigma throughout the movie .
An improbable duo	Domenico , a petty criminal in Italy , decides to rob a bank . In order to bring his gun inside , he has a clever prop : a cat's cage , which goes unnoticed , as everyone is more interested in whether the cat is a male or female . Domenico has come to a bank where everyone seems to be doing what they weren't supposed to be doing , but he is handed a lot of money for his effort . As he is going out , Tomasso , a man who is entering , realizes the situation and goes along in being taken hostage by the goofy Domenico . Tomasso knows Domenico is no real bandit , so he puts his own plan into action . The bank robber wanted to go north to Switzerland , but Tomasso reasons with him that the only way out is to go south , something that changes Domenico's plans completely . As they stop at Tomasso's house to get some clothes , it's clear the hostage has conceived a better plan of action . Domenico decides to follow his newly found friend as they embark in an adventure that will be the beginning of a great friendship . Director Davide Ferrario , who collaborated also on the screen play with Diego Abatantuono , brings some interesting ideas to this combination of male bonding and road movie that was blessed by the choice of its two stars , Mr . Abatantuono , an excellent actor , and Silvio Orlando , a versatile actor whose work we have admired . Besides the two principals , Valentina Cervi , Flavio Insinna , Elena Giove and Ugo Conti do some good work under Mr . Ferrario's direction .
Flying colors	" Spin " came as a total surprise . We had not heard about the movie before , so when it was shown on cable recently , we decided to watch it , something that paid off because it is basically an unpretentious look at a not too distant past . James Redford , is making his debut as a director showing he has an eye for detail . The story centers around Eddie . When we meet him , he is a young boy who has to deal with the premature death of his parents in a small plane crash . As a result , his only living relative is a distant uncle , a major in the Air Force , who practically abandons him to the caretaker couple that works for him in the Arizona ranch . Eddie's uncle , as well as his father , have a passion for flying that is transferred to the young man . A few years go by and next we see a teen aged Eddie who is not doing well in school . His friendship with the lovely Francesca develops into love , but fate intervenes in their lives . The film has a lovely finished look thanks to the cinematography of Paul Ryan who captured the rugged Arizona landscape in all its glory . The musical score is by Todd Boekelheide , which serves the film well . The performances are credible as Ryan Merriman makes us care for his Eddie . Stanley Tucci , Dana Delany , Ruben Blades and Paula Garces are the other performers . James Redford does a good job with his first directorial assignment .
Love begins at 54 . . .	Eric Schaeffer's film was a detour from all the thrillers that opened in the summertime . This " small " picture proves that with the right ingredients , an enjoyable movie could be made . It was a pleasant surprise to see the great Jill Clayburgh return to film , after being away for a while , in a starring role . She makes this woman believable and it's a pleasure to watch her fall in love with a man who is real and not a stereotype . Jeffrey Tambor , is right up to the challenge to make this man the object of Ms Clayburgh's affections . This is a very " NewYorkish " type of film . We have known people like the girlfriends that push Ms . Clayburgh to take a chance in dating . Also , Jeffrey Tambor's world is easy to believe . He's the ugly duckling who has a lot to offer underneath his plain facade . Life in this film seems to begin late in the life of the main characters . It was a joy to have seen this movie .
Apologies	Anthony Minghella , the talented English director , wrote the screen play for " Breaking and Entering " . As the title suggests , this is a story about alienation , exile , the clash of cultures , among other things . Mr . Minghella whose death leaves a tremendous gap in the world cinema , was a man whose work will be sadly missed by discerning fans . He was , above all , a man of impeccable taste and it shows throughout his entire career . The story centers around an architect , Will , who decides to go to an unsavory part of town to locate his office . The area is crime infected . Soon criminals invade the premises to steal things that can easily be disposed and will fetch a good return to the criminals . Will is the lover of Liv and although it appears they have a nice thing going , we get an impression that all is not well between them . When Will's computer is stolen , he gets upset . He decides to keep surveillance on the place until he watches a young man breaking into his office . Will is determined to track him down and succeeds in locating the public housing project in which he lives . To his amazement , he discovers the young thief's mother is a seamstress , Amira , and decides to go to her with the feeble excuse he wants some suits altered . What Will doesn't imagine is to what extent he will become attached to the beautiful woman . She is a refugee from Bosnia who lives by taking private jobs in order to support herself and the son , who she doesn't suspects of being capable of any wrong doing . Will and Amira get into an affair that's bigger than both of them . He gets something bigger than what he bargained for , thus putting in peril his own relationship with Liv . When all it's said and done , Will ends up apologizing to Amira and to Liv . The ending it's a cop out , because Will enters into his affair with open eyes . He ends up apologizing to everyone . Begging forgiveness he feels exonerated , perhaps , for his actions and what he did to both Amira and Liv . One wishes the film would have had a different resolution , but one can see why Minghella decided to go ahead with his instinct . The movie has an excellent cast . It's probably one of the best things Jude Law has done in recent memory . Robin Wright Penn makes a great Liv . Juliette Binoche is also effective as Amira . It's sad in a way to realize this was Mr . Minghella's last work when he had so much to give us .
Lucy in New City	Imagine a New York socialite arriving at a desolate Texas oil town in the 1930s with four suitcases plus a few carry-ons . Poor Lucy Gallant stuck out like a sore thumb ! One thing going for her was her ability to adapt to the situation in which is thrown into . She proved she had a head for business when she manages to sell her whole wardrobe to the wives of the new oil barons . These women were ripe for getting whatever fashions they could lay their hands on . Lucy's success comes with a disappointment . Even though she loves Casey , the man who would end up being a millionaire , she feels she wants to pursue her career as a business woman . After all , she had started out of nothing to build the store of her dreams . Being a woman in that environment also brings her to the reality of seeing what she had built taken away from her during a sneaky maneuver by the man she trusted to help her run the business . In the end , Lucy realizes that being with Casey is a lot more fulfilling than the business she created . Robert Parrish directed this Paramount release . Jane Wyman was the right choice to play Lucy . She was an intelligent actress who always projected warmth to any role she played . She is the whole reason for watching the film . Charlton Heston plays the awkward Casey Cole with conviction . Others in the cast include the excellent Thelma Ritter , who is a joy to watch in everything she played . Claire Trevor and William Demarest are also seen in pivotal roles .
Innocent times in suburbia	Some films ought to be seen in the context of the era in which they were made . It's unfair , in a way , to dismiss a lot of them because they appear to be dated , or because they don't hold our attention because one can't identify with the subject which is being treated . This seems to be the case of " Boys Night Out " , a mildly amusing comedy from the early 60s . Directed by Michael Gordon , it shows its age , but still , there are a lot of ingredients that show the viewer how we lived during those less complex times in this country . " Boys Night Out " would be impossible to make in the present climate . Where could stars of the stature of Kim Novak , James Garner , Tony Randall , be found to play in it ? Salaries alone would make such an enterprise impossible by today's standards , and yet , a little more than forty years ago , this sleek package was put together without much problem , or so it appears . The film offers some rewards to the viewer that stays with it . The idea of four men getting together to rent an apartment and get a dream woman to cater to their fantasies would not be easy to do without including a lot of sex . Little do these men realize they are , in turn , being a case study for the same woman they all desire . Kim Novak , at the height of her beauty , does a wonderful job with her Cathy . James Garner also has wonderful moments , especially playing opposite Jessie Royce Landis , who appears as his mother . Tony Randall , Howard Duff , Oskar Homolka , Zsa Zsa Gabor , Jim Backus , Fred Ward , and the rest of the cast are good in the film . " Boys Night Out " is a comedy about male fantasy about the best of two different worlds .
Wyoming in all its splendor	Mary O'Hara's novel " My Friend Flicka " is the basis for this wonderful family oriented movie . Directed by Michael Mayer , a man whose work we had admired before , offers a positive view of a Wyoming family that is struggling to make a living out the ranch where they raise horses and the changes that are happening around them . At the center of the story is Katy McLaughlin , a young woman who is happier being in the family ranch than at the boarding school , where she seems to be out of place . When Katy goes back home after not completing a key exam , she begins to feel like a human being . All the great outdoors are at her finger tips . The horses she loves are also part of her life . A fearless rider , Katy is surprised one day by a mountain lion who comes near her . A mustang that appears out of nowhere comes to her rescue , attracting Katy's attention . A bond will develop between the young woman and the horse that will prove it to be a mutual love and respect they feel about one another . She names the horse Flicka and becomes her champion when her father feels a mustang doesn't belong in the ranch because what it will do to the other pure bred horses . In the end , the father , as well as the family realize how deep Katy cares for Flicka and the way the horse responds to her . Alison Lohman , who is seen as Flicka , is an actress that seems a natural no matter what role she is asked to play . Tim McGraw does justice to the father , and lovely Maria Bello is perfect as the mother . The beautiful cinematography by J . Michael Muro does wonders to create the right atmosphere in which the action is presented . The same can be said for the musical score of Aaron Zigman , which is tuneful and fits well in the picture . There is no doubt Michael Mayer will continue to surprise us in his future projects . Highly recommended for all families .
I Robot	Michael Crichton is a versatile man whose career as a novelist would seem to be satisfying enough without trying his hand at the movies . After all , most of his books have been adapted for the screen . This was his first attempt at directing a big feature . He showed in " Westworld " an affinity for the film medium . Mr . Chrichton employed computer technology that was in its infancy at the time . The result is a movie that is entertaining even after more than thirty years after it was released . Most of Mr . Crichton's books deal in science fiction . The best thing in the film is Yul Brynner , without a doubt . His presence dominates everything . As the Gunslinger , he shows intelligence and tenacity in dealing with those that dared to cross him . Richard Benjamin is also effective as the young lawyer who is fascinated by the things he finds in Westworld . James Brolin's character seemed to be on auto pilot as he didn't register much emotion throughout the entire movie . The film merits a look .
Doomed lovers	Maria Callas , one of the most talented opera singers of her time , seemed to have it all . Coming from humble origins , she always felt slighted by her mother's preference for her sister . She grew up in an unhappy environment , until her career in the operatic world took off . Aristotles Onassis also came from a poor Greek family . His ambition took him places where others dare not go and became a shipping magnate whose great wealth bought his entry into an international society he didn't ever dreamed of entering . These two powerful personalities were so much alike that their own passion served to destroy them . Ari , the ambitious man , was insatiable as far as the pleasures he found in women . Maria , on the other hand was so much in love that it's easy to see what Ari's betrayal did to her . The biggest offence was Onassis ' courting Jacqueline Kennedy , who was instrumental in getting his foot in doing business in America . Her glamorous looks proved too much to resists when he proposed . Maria who had given up her career and suffered the loss of her voice , was the one that suffered the most . This ambitious film made for television in a co-production of Italy and Switzerland follows the story of the two lovers faithfully . Giorgio Capitani directed this mini-series that puts the action in the places where the principals lived . The end result is a glossy look at that world of the ultra rich and famous done with great style .
And all that jazz	Howard Hawks remake of his 1941 comedy " Ball of Fire " was a vehicle for Danny Kaye , who was popular at the time . This film is based on a story by Billy Wilder and Thomas Monroe , which had also been the basis of the original film . The movie was shot in Technicolor , something that must have been one of the stipulations of its star , Danny Kaye . By changing the original premise from learning about slang to learning about the new popular rhythms that had come out during the thirties and forties , the creators thought they were updating the basic idea , and they succeed , at times . The best thing in this film is the array of talent we see . Some of the giants in popular music of that time , are seen at their best in musical numbers that are clever and that reminds the viewer how classic compositions could relate to the new expressions . The central story is just a pretext to present Danny Kaye , who is the nerdy professor Frisbee , and his co-star , Virginia Mayo , a night club singer , Honey Swanson . Professor Frisbee gets in hot water because unknown to him , Honey is involved with a gangster , Tony Crow , who doesn't want to let go of his beautiful girlfriend . Besides the two stars , Steve Cochran puts in an appearance as Tony . Some of the best known popular musicians of that era are seen doing wonderful music together . Tommy Dorsey , Mel Powell , Buck and Bubbles , Charlie Barnett , Louis Armstrong , Lionel Hampton , and Benny Goodman , who plays one of the professors . The film , while not as original as its model , is worth watching for the music alone . Music fans are in for a treat thanks to Mr . Hawks .
If it's seen on television , it must be true !	The power of the sensational media is examined in this film by Ecuadorian director Sebastian Cordero . He has created a disturbing piece of film making , almost a documentary , in style , that examines how unscrupulous journalists manipulate the news . " Cronicas " is a tough movie to sit through , but perhaps that's Mr . Cordero's achievement . The film will make one think . " Cronicas " takes us to the interior of Ecuador . There is a pederast running wild in the countryside raping and killing innocent children . An investigating reporter , Mannolo Bonilla , is sent to investigate about the case . Bonilla is based in Miami , where he no doubt contributes to those sensational types of programs directed to Latinos in which a lot of blood and gore is the norm for some of those Spanish channels . Manolo Bonilla is a man who has seen a lot . That is why when Vinicio's car kills one young boy , he is taken by the mob before the police arrive and he is set on fire . Manolo instructs his cameraman to keep on filming because that item will run prominently in Victor's program . Vinicio is saved by the police , who take him to jail together with the people who tortured him , and the father of the boy who was killed . Bonilla suspects Vinicio of being the famous Monster of Babahoyo . The problem is that Vinicio is a cunning man , who might be the one killing the children . When he interviews him , Bonilla thinks he has unearthed the truth , but through mixed signals , Victor goes ahead with the story and Vinicio is made to appear as a victim and is released from prison . In the end , Bonilla leaves the country as a hero , but little does he know he has contributed to perpetuate the killings that will continue because the real culprit is at large . John Leguziamo has one of the best moments of his career as the journalist who passes through all these troubled areas capturing for the camera and interviewing people who will have to deal with their own reality in their environment , whereas Manolo Bonilla will return home to Miami and will probably forget about what he has seen . Damian Alcazar is Vinicio , the bible salesman with a lot in his conscience . He is a troubled soul who is in denial and don't recognize his guilt . Mr . Alcazar gives a great performance . Leonor Watling is Victor's wife and a producer of the news program . Alfred Molina is only seen on his television program , but doesn't have much to do . The cinematography of Enrique Chediak captures the misery and the substandard conditions of the area where the film takes place . The haunting music by Antonio Pinto enhances the action . Ultimately , the director Sebastian Cordero is to be congratulated for clarifying for us the concept that if it is seen on television , then , it must be true what we are being shown , and it's the truth , even if it is manipulated one .

The joke being told for our benefit by some of the best talent performing today in this country .
Lost in Venice	Silvio Soldini's delightful comedy was a surprise when we first saw it in its original release . On second viewing recently , " Pane e Tulipani " looks still fresh . This is a film that seems to be telling us never be afraid to take a stand and to experiment .

When the film opens we see the Italian tour group at one of the ancient ruins in their country . As the trip continue , our eyes are set on the gorgeous Rosalba , the middle age woman who is among the passengers with her husband and two children .

The rest of the cast is good . This is a film that will warm one's heart .
The back roads of Arizona	Richard Greenberg , the director of " Desert Saints " , has been involved with a lot of movies as an assistant director . It's clear he has learned his craft well . This film , which he co-wrote with Waley Nichols , came as a total surprise , not having seen it before . If you haven't seen the film , please stop reading here . Arthur Banks is a hired killer . Arthur is an educated man , who has gone to the other side of the law because he is an impeccable man as far as doing his job well for a lot of money . Don't double cross him though , because he will take care of anyone that dares to do so in a cool and detached manner , as we see him do as the film opens . When he meets Beenie , we wonder why is he taking a chance on the hitchhiking girl , or for that matter , what makes the girl go with this stranger , who might be a criminal on the loose . How naive can this woman be ? Of course , this chance meeting is what is at the heart of the movie , as we shall see later on . In fact , Banks seems to have hand picked Beenie to mold her into his own plan . In the meantime , we watch as FBI agents are following Banks ' trail all over Arizona . They know he is heading south to Mexico , but what is he going to do there ? Arthur Banks is planning to take down a Mexican political figure , but things change for him unexpectedly as he prepares to do his thing . The last sequence is intriguing because it's something unexpected , as we watch how Beenie fools the people that want to talk to her . It appears that Beenie has a friend who has been working with her from within , but will Beenie be able to fool Arthur Banks ? Well , your guess is as good as anyone's because the ambiguous ending the cunning director has given his story . The film works because of Kiefer Sutherland's take on Arthur Banks . This actor always can be counted to deliver in anything he does . Besides his good looks , Mr . Sutherland projects an intelligence as he plays the character he is portraying on the screen , as proved by his many other films . Melora Walters is also effective as Beenie , an enigmatic figure once we get to see her operate . Jamey Sheridan makes sense of his agent Scanlon , the man pursuing Banks through the desert .

" Desert Saints " is a film that surprises because the direction by Richard Greenberg .
The interrogators	Watching this wonderful Christian Bauer documentary we couldn't help drawing a parallel to the present area of conflict , Iraq , in which some of our soldiers have been accused of abuse of the prisoners they were interrogating . " The Ritchie Boys " , in contrast , offers an excellent account of a group of young men , recently arrived to the United States that were enlisted in a special division of the US Army that dealt with the interrogation of captured enemy soldiers . These newly arrive immigrants had an unique talent in that they were fluent in their language , and in English , thus making them perfect to get the most out of the prisoners they came in contact with . The documentary speak volumes about these men who recount their story for our benefit . They survived the horrors in their native countries out of the sacrifice of their parents , who decided to send them abroad , rather than see them die , a fate most of those that stayed behind would suffer . We are introduced to some of the survivors of the group that were known affectionately as " The Ritchie Boys " , as they look today . After having been inducted in the Army , as WWII was being fought in Europe , most of the men who had a European background and could help in the process of talking to the captured enemy in their native languages , were sent to Fort Ritchie in rural Maryland to prepare them for their jobs . Most of these fellows were of Jewish background and they had a real reason for coming down hard on the captured soldiers , but instead , they acted with the most incredible restraint , in what must have been a horrible situation . After all , most of them ended up going back to a Germany that was exterminating their families , friends , and culture . It is to the credit that most of these men went to make something out of themselves and contributed to their adopted country in ways no one could have imagined . Mr . Bauer , and his editor , David Kazala , have done a wonderful job of mixing the narrative of the Ritchie Boys with documentary footage of WWII .
Bittersweet romance	" Shopgirl " , the magnificent novella by Steve Martin , finally arrives as a movie that expands on the text , as Anand Tucker , its director , demonstrates . Steve Martin also adapted his own story , which works well with the movie version since he knows what he wants to say and how to present the story in cinematic terms . This film is about how sometimes a man , who evidently is a successful business person , can't see what he does to a woman who , in spite of the warnings , has fallen deeply in love with him . Ray Porter , is an egotistical man , incapable of expressing his emotions unless they are in the form of material things . Ray is an empty man who can buy whoever he wants to be with , but who demands there will be no strings attached to any sort of relationship . Mirabelle , the young gloves sales lady at Los Angeles ' Saks 5th Ave . , is a lonely girl who has relocated to the city from Vermont . It's hard for anyone in that environment to connect with people , especially in a place like L . A . where no one talks to one another and everyone seems to be impressed with celebrities that are to be seen everywhere . Mirabelle is destined to a life of loneliness until two men appear at about the same time , the goofy Jeremy , and Ray Porter . Jeremy likes Mirabelle in his own crazy way . Mirabelle responds to him because he means easy companionship without complications . When Ray appears on the scene , Mirabelle has no clue about what she is getting in for . Before anything , Ray makes it clear he wants no commitment , and no attachment . It's just a convenient situation for him as he has calculated that Mirabelle is perhaps a sexual diversion , at best . He finally reveals what he really has in mind when he tells the girl his intentions for the New York apartment , something that he hasn't included her in , at all . This bittersweet story comes alive because of Claire Danes great performance as Mirabelle . Ms . Danes is perfectly cast as Mirabelle . Steve Martin's characterization as Ray Porter , is superb in his take about this man . Mr . Martin clearly understands what this man is really like and what makes him tick . Both these actors contribute to making their characters feel real . On the other hand , the goofy performance from Jason Schartzman is distracting from the other story . The best sequence involves the beautiful Bridgette Wilson in thinking Jeremy is the real Ray Porter . The excellent cinematography by Peter Suschitzky gives " Shopgirl " a sophisticated look that goes perfectly with the story being told . Anand Tucker directed with elegance and a sure hand making the film a winner .
The Brighton gang	Graham Greene's novel of the same title was adapted by its author and Terence Rattigan , a distinguished writer and playwright on his own right . We read the novel ages ago , and frankly , it was a surprise when the film version was shown on a cable network recently . Directed by John Boulting , this interesting film deserves a viewing , not only because of its screen play , but what he got out of his marvelous cast . At the center of the story is the ruthless Pinkie Brown , a man with no scruples . He wants to impose himself as the crime boss of the city . In doing so , he and his men terrorize everyone they come in contact with . The only person that seems to have any influence in him is the pious Rose , a Catholic girl whose conscience struggles with her love for Pinkie . Richard Attenborough makes a tremendous impression as Pinkie with his menacing looks and evil demeanor shows this man to have no redeeming qualities . This is one of Mr . Attenborough's best creations in the cinema , and frankly , he made quite a splash playing this gangster . Hermione Baddeley , one of the best English character actresses , makes a great appearance as Ida , the woman who clearly understands what Pinkie is all about and who will be instrumental in his downfall . The supporting players do an excellent job under Mr . Boulting's direction . " Brighton Rock " deserves to be seen . Graham Greene wrote a novel that deals not only with gangsters , he was also interested in religion as shown in the film with the character of Rose , who struggles between her faith and her love for a criminal .
Driving under the influence	" In This Our Life " dared to point out some issues not discussed by the Hollywood of the 40s . It shows a great director , John Huston , working at the top of his craft on the interesting adaptation by Howard Koch . Stanley , the girl at the center of the story has it all . She is the favorite niece of the man who was responsible for ruining her father , a gentle soul beaten by the Great Depression . Stanley is a spoiled woman who couldn't care less who she hurt , let alone that is her own sister the one that will suffer because of her actions . On the other hand , Roy , the good sister , is all kindness ; she is just the opposite of Stanley . When Stanley decides she wants Peter , Roy's husband , she doesn't hesitate one second . She takes him and runs away to a life that proves not to be all what she imagined it would be . Life intervenes in Stanley's life in tragic ways . First with Peter , the man he shouldn't have taken away from her sister , and then when trying to get back with Craig , she causes the death of a young girl when driving under the influence . This would have been a sobering experience for anyone , but Stanley is beyond repentance . Stanley , is a coward who will do anything to get away with murder . Stanley was a role tailor made for Bette Davis . Her take on this impudent girl is perfect . Ms . Davis shows how good she is in small details that convey her understanding of her character . Ms . Davis reflects all the emotions Stanley is going through with her expressive eyes . One look at her and we know what this woman is capable of . Olivia de Havilland makes an impression by playing the good sister , Roy . Ms . de Havilland is an actress that always played convincingly in everything she did , as is the case here . Her inner strength is her best asset . Roy is loyal to the point of sacrificing her own happiness and lets her sister take what she loves most . The strong cast behind the principals is equally excellent . Dennis Morgan is Peter , the man blinded by Stanley . He will leave his adoring wife for a woman he ends up detesting . George Brent , is the kind Craig , the man jilted by Stanley who finally finds love again with Roy . Charles Coburn plays Uncle William with his usual panache . Frank Craven is Asa , the man cheated out of his fortune . Ernest Anderson makes an impression as Parry , the young black man with ambitions to improve himself . Hattie McDaniel only has a couple of key scenes where she shines . Billie Burke and Lee Patrick are seen in minor roles . The musical score by Alfred Newman enhances the film . Ultimately it's John Huston who shows a clear understanding for the material and who gets excellent performances out of everyone .
Desperate housewives adopting babies	Adopting children should be a labor of love . After all , if a woman finds herself unable to conceive , it would probably be a good idea to let her go anywhere where orphans and children that have been given up for adoption to be reunited with an infant . Well , in most cases , as we see in this film , there are people that profit from this process . It has turned to be a commercial enterprise for many people . We know a few cases where overseas adoptions have cost upwards of $100 , 000 . 00 , when all is taken into account . We meet six American women who have come to Mexico in the hope of adopting children . For one reason , or another , they haven't been able to have their own babies . The connection is clear , in this case , the lawyer in charge of the adoption recommend their clients to stay at Posada Santa Marta , where the owner , Senora Munoz is working with the unscrupulous man . Since the law requires to have a local lawyer , most would be mothers have to rely on this intermediary in order to adopt . The six women in the story are so different from one another that it is hard to imagine them socializing , had they not been thrown together in the hotel to await for their newly adopted babies . Although we don't get to know them in intimate details , we can see their desire to be mothers . The quiet Skipper turns out to be the one who has suffered three dreadful pregnancies in which all three infants had died . Nan , a pushy woman , is an unhappy camper . Everything irritates her and she lets anyone know about what she thinks about the country and the adoption procedures . Eileen , coming from a large Irish family has not been able to conceive . Leslie and Gayle seem to be the best adjusted of the women . Jennifer , is the youngest of them all . There are also a couple of stories running parallel to the American women . The most touching story comes from Asuncion , one of the maids in the hotel . When Eileen tries to communicate with her , the maid , not understanding her , tells her in Spanish about the way she had to give up her own baby girl for adoption . Also , we see what appears to be an upscale woman with her pregnant daughter , Celia , as the mother weighs her options and how the girl will not have an adoption . Celia , who is only fifteen years old , evidently had relations with Reynaldo , the young stud that roams the beach in search of easy conquests . John Sayles never cease to amaze us with his stories . In this film he tackles the commerce that goes on in the adoption process . At the same time , he makes a case for how complicated the whole thing is and how these would be mothers have to face as these young infants grow in an environment that stands in sharp contrast with the street children he brings into the movie . Those children are desperately in need for adoption , yet their own society , or would be parents , will bypass them in favor of the ones that can only be obtained in a legal manner . The ensemble cast does wonders under Mr . Sayles direction . Best of all is Marcia Gay Harden , as the pathetic Nan , a prototype of the " ugly American " abroad . Daryl Hannah has some excellent moments as Skipper . Lili Taylor , Mary Steenburgen , Maggie Gyllenhaal are fine . Susan Lynch has a great moment as she tries to talk with the maid . Vanessa Martinez gives a good rendition of her character Asuncion . Rita Moreno is also seen as the owner of the hotel . " Casa de los Babys " takes an excellent view at the thorny issue of adoptions .
Out of the past	The friendship of Frankie Madison and Noll " Dink " Turner was solid during the prohibition era of the country . They had a good scheme going until Frankie is caught with the goods he is bringing to their speakeasy in Manhattan . Madison has to serve fourteen years for the crime . When he is released from prison , Dave , a mutual friend who now works for Turner is sent to meet the ex-con and help him settle down .

Turner wants to use Kay to pump information from Madison , but he soon discovers the duplicity , but in reality , the singer's heart is not into betraying Frankie , who she seems to have taken a liking to . On the other hand , Mrs . Richardson can't get her hands on this new arrival the way she has gotten away with Dink . Dink feels threatened by Madison's arrival into the scene . When they have an argument about the money owed to Frankie , Dink has a plan to get rid of his friend . Dave , the accountant , who has been called to explain to Madison the intricacies of the corporation that owns the club , sees what Dink is trying to do . Frankie Madison gets a chance to get what is due to him . He also gets to keep the gorgeous Kay ! " I Walk Alone " , directed by Byron Haskin , is a good example of those films that came out after WWII . It's worth a look because of the marvelous cast assembled to appear in it . " I Walk Alone " marks the first time Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas appeared together in movies . Although the top billing is given to Wendell Corey , he has little to do in it . The husky-voiced Lizabeth Scott plays the sultry Kay Lawrence with her usual flair . She is beautifully dressed by Edith Head . Victor Young's musical score and Leo Tover's cinematography contribute to the overall success of this movie .
Convoy	" Action in the North Atlantic " a war time tale of 1943 shows great special effects and battle scenes that have a realistic look to them . In fact , the film which turned up on cable recently , was a total surprise . Director Lloyd Bacon showed a flair with this WWII drama about the men that operated the Merchant Marine . We are taken to the North Atlantic where a group of ships are made to form a convoy , hoping that being so close to each other , they might be protected from attacks . Little prepared the organizers of this idea for the arrival of the infamous German submarines and planes . The action one sees is centered in the Liberty ship that is heading for the old Soviet Union . The heroic account of what the crew of that ship experienced is a tribute to the courageous men that put their lives in peril in order to get their cargo to the different destinations . Humphrey Bogart , as Lt . Joe Rossi , makes a great appearance . He is totally believable as the man who takes over for his wounded captain and brings the ship to safety . Raymond Massey plays Capt . Jarvis , a man totally dedicated to his profession . Alan Hale , Sam Levene and Dane Clark are seen as part of the brave crew of the Liberty . Ruth Gordon and Julie Bishop are the women left behind . The film has a great black and white photography by Ted McCord and a haunting musical score by Adolph Deutsch . The battle scenes were staged by Lloyd Bacon with an uncredited assistance from Raoul Walsh and they are amazing for what was accomplished in those days where the technology wasn't so advanced .

During the course of a few hours he will have to face the truth about himself as his past comes back to haunt him in ways he didn't realize it would affect him . Amy Fox has opened up her play by writing a wonderful screen treatment that Chris Terrio , the young and multi talented director presents for us with great panache . Ms . Fox created strong characters that come alive in the film . We are taken to some of Manhattan's rooftops and terraces to get a first rate account of people trying to deal with real problems . A point the film is trying to make is about how well do we know people close to us , even those we think we are in love with . At the center of the movie is Elizabeth , who is living with Jonathan . They are planning to get married . Elizabeth is a talented photographer who is a free lancer . Jonathan is Jewish , but she is not ; he wants her to go to see the Rabbi who is going to marry them . It's clear they are not at the same wave length , and not because they come from different religious backgrounds . Diane , Elizabeth's mother , is a much admired actress in the New York stage . She has an eye for spotting handsome young men , as it's the case when she auditions Alec , a young actor that wants to be in a play she is going to direct . It's clear she likes him for other non acting role as well . Diane and her present husband are married for appearances sake , as we get to see him in action with another woman . " Heights " makes an interesting point in showing how inter connected all these characters are and how a small , innocent incident , will unravel things as Elizabeth gets to see first hand how wrong she has been about the man she is going to marry . Glenn Close , as Diana , makes an amazing appearance in the film . She is such an elegant performer that knows well what makes Diana act the way she does . She is not a diva , on the contrary , she seems to be a grounded woman whose love for her daughter is clear . Elizabeth Banks is wonderful as Diana's daughter , Isabel . The surprise of the film came via George Segal , who as Rabbi Mendel , clearly sees what's troubling Jonathan . Mr . Segal is a welcome sight in the film after being absent so long . James Marsden , Jesse Bradford , Rufus Wainwright , Eric Bogosian , Michael Murphy and a lot of New York based stage actors are seen in minor , but effective roles . This film clearly demonstrates the talent of Chris Terrio bringing all these actors together to do ensemble work . Mr . Terrio is lucky to be working with Jim Denault who has photographed the film with such an elegant style . Also the music by Ben Butler and Martin Erskine enhances the film .
The front page	" After Office Hours " , directed by Robert Z . Leonard was shown as part of a Constance Bennett retrospective the other day on TCM . This 1935 film was written for the screen by Herman Mankiewicz . The wonderful world of New York's high society and the sensational news by the tabloids of the thirties are combined in this movie to give us a fast paced comedy in which most of the comments submitted to this forum express a surprise in the turn it takes when the happy situation at the start of the film and the illicit romance being investigated by a newspaper changes into a different , and unexpected climax . The gorgeous Constance Bennett and the handsome Clark Gable are a delight to watch in the movie . Both these actors had great chemistry , and frankly , it's a shame they weren't seen together more often . Ms . Bennett was at , perhaps , one of the best times in her career and as the society girl turned newspaper music critic , she makes quite an impression . Also , the newspaper editor portrayed by Mr . Gable is one of his best characterizations in the movies . Also in the cast some famous faces , the luminous Billie Burke , who plays Ms . Bennett's mother is a welcome presence in any film . Stuwart Erwin , Harvey Stephens , Henry Travers , William Demarest and Margaret Dumond are seen in supporting roles . This is an excellent movie because of the fine contributions of Constance Bennett and Clark Gable .
Bonding	Murph and Paul seem to be the least likely candidates of this beautiful tale of male bonding and friendship that director Tom Gilroy , working with his original material , brought to the screen with excellent results . The director couldn't have been luckier in the choice he made in casting Ned Beatty and Liev Schrieber to give life to these two opposite characters , that deep down share a lot in common . We see the men as they begin working together , in a way distrusting one another , but soon realizing their relationship at work translates in everlasting friendship . Mr . Gilroy gets nuanced performances out of the two leading actors that seem to compliment one another in ways that perhaps , even the director , didn't expect . Mr . Beatty and Mr . Schreiber are actors that look and act totally convincing in the roles they are playing . In minor parts we see Campbell Scott , Ian Hart and Peri Gilpin , among others doing excellent work under Tom Gilroy's sure direction . Mr . Gilroy has to be congratulated for giving us a story that is unusual and it affirms our faith in humanity .
Love during the plague	" Giorni " presents an intriguing premise in that it takes the side of a patient infected with the HIV virus that encounters love and a kind of happiness with another person that is afflicted with it . While some comments in this forum express opinions about how depressing the whole thing is , we hate to differ . There are indications that Claudio , who loved Andrea , finds himself at the end in a positive way and that he is changed for the best . This Italian film , directed by Laura Muscardin , presents a sobering aspect of people living with the virus . In fact , we would even go to the extent to say it's a frank and sincere effort about people that live with HIV . These individuals suddenly see how slim their chances are to lead a somewhat normal life in a loving relationship . Claudio's relationship with Dario is a thing of the past , as the movie starts . He is seen taking the cocktail of medicines that are keeping him alive . When the sincere Andrea appears in the picture , Claudio is taken aback by the way he feels about this stranger that genuinely cares for him . Claudio , in fact , while loving Andrea , is surprised by the way the other man has transformed him for the best . The performance of Riccardo Salerno , who plays Andrea , is in sharp contrast with the intensity Thomas Trabacchi's Claudio . Both these actors make a pair of credible lovers who , although doomed from the start , still take a chance by loving one another . The Andrea of Mr . Salerno speaks volumes , as he convinces the viewer about his love for Claudio . Mr . Salerno's take on his character endears himself to us because one realizes he is the real thing . Mr . Trabacchi has more opportunities to shine , yet , it's the kind Andrea who stays in one's mind . The film is a serious attempt by the director , Laura Muscardin , to inject intelligence into the relationship between Claudio and Andrea .
A nostalgic look at the streets of New York	Director Edward Montagne does in a little more than one hour what other , more expensive and hyped films fail to do . Mr . Montagne shows us a police story written by Phillip H . Reisman Jr . that while , is not one of the best of the genre , it keeps the viewer involved in all that's going on . This is clearly a B type movie . In fact , the best thing going for " The Tattooed Stranger " is the opportunity to take a peek at the way New York looked in those years . The crystal clear cinematography by William O . Steiner , either has been kept that way through the years , or has been lovingly restored . There are great views of New York in the opening sequence . Later we are taken to Brooklyn to the Dumbo section and later on the film travels to the Bronx and the Gun Hill Road area with its many monument stores in the area . John Miles and Walter Kinsella made a great detective team . Patricia Barry is perfect as the plant expert from the Museum of Natural History . Jack Lord , who went to bigger things in his career , is seen in a non speaking role . It was great fun to watch a city , as it was , because it doesn't exist any more .
Cousin , cousin	This film , based on the Daphne du Maurier's novel is practically unknown , as it appears to have been forgotten ; it never turns on reruns , but it's worth a look nevertheless . " My Cousin Rachel " was directed by Henry Koster , based on the adaptation by Nunnally Johnson , who did a good job in creating the right atmosphere for the film . The great cinematography of Joseph LaShelle enhances what the director set out to do in more ways than he probably imagined . Mr . LaShelle was one of the most elegant cinematographers of that era . Just look at his seascapes to appreciate his art . This film marks the beginning of Richard Burton's career in the American Cinema . While it was not his first film , the actor brought such an intensity to his role that earned an acting nomination for best supporting actor . He should have been nominated as the best actor , since his role is the whole movie ! Olivia DeHavilland makes an excellent Rachel , at times loving , at others sly and calculating . She had a special beauty . Her eyes express a lot in her close ups . Ms . DeHavilland was totally convincing in her take of this woman who comes back to claim her inheritance when everything is taken away from her . The rest of the cast is good as they play in ensemble fashion . Audrey Dalton makes a lovely Louise , the loyal friend . Also John Sutton , who unfortunately doesn't stay around too long to make justice of his role of Ambrose . As a Gothic mystery , this film will not disappoint .
Escape from the chain gang	Stanley Kramer was a Hollywood producer who turned into a director . He shows he had a promise when he undertook the direction of this production that involved race relations in the America of the 1950s , where segregation was still in place . To even set the story in the Deep South , as he did here , shows that Kramer was clearly not afraid of whatever repercussions the movie would get , or the problems associated for showing this situation to wide audiences . Basically , this is the story of two men who are shackled together , one white , one black , as they are being transported to a forced labor camp . When their bus suffers an accident , Joker , the white man , and Noah , the black one , see it as their opportunity to escape . There is one problems though , they can't get the chain that binds their wrists to be cut , however much they try . The sheriff of the place where the accident happens , quickly organizes a manhunt throughout the area . It will be only a matter of time when these two convicts will be caught . What starts as two men trying to avoid being captured , turns out into a sort of friendship between Joker and Noah . Joker , will never accept Noah , and vice versa , but they must stick together if they want to survive . Tony Curtis , who up to this point in his career , had only been given light roles to play , is the unexpected surprise of the film . In fact , this is one of the best roles he ever played in the movies , bar none . Sidney Poitier , on the other hand , plays against type in the movies . We always saw him as the decent black man who was a noble creature and wasn't appreciated . In this film , none of those qualities are shown by his character , who must deal with the burden of having to drag Joker along at the same time he is trying to save his own skin . The supporting cast made an excellent contribution to Mr . Kramer's direction . The excellent Theodore Bikel played Sheriff Max Muller with conviction . Charles McGraw , Leon Chaney Jr . , Claude Akins , and Cora Williams contribute to make this film better than it could have been . The brilliant black and white photography by Sam Leavitt enhanced the film . Stanley Kramer deserved credit for bringing this story into the screen at a time when no one was doing anything as daring as what he did .
Cross country driving looking for Andy	" The Talent Given Us " is a disarming film done cinema-verite style where the Wagner family is shown candidly as they embark in a voyage of discovery when they travel cross country trying to visit their son Andy , a screen writer living in Los Angeles . The Wagners are an outspoken New York City family who tell it all to the camera in a disarming way . The patriarch , Allen , is afflicted with an undisclosed neurological illness that has made him weak and must be careful walking , as he might fall easily . Judy , the mother , is a woman full of life , who seems to be a fun person to know because she is a no nonsense woman . We meet also the two daughters , Maggie and Emily . The funny part of the story is that we see Emily arriving from L . A . at the beginning of the movie . Judy , the concerned mother who has been trying unsuccessfully to contact Andrew , suddenly has the urge to keep going west to see what's wrong with her son . Along the way , we get to know more of the Wagners , as we feel we are in the car with them , going for the ride . The trip seems to bring the Wagners closer together . Allen and Judy seem to find peace as they start the return journey home . Emily seems also to have encountered harmony and Bumpy , the friend that comes along for the ride , is also more adjusted to accept her life . And Andy ? Well , let that be a surprise to you , as it was to us . This is a charming film made possible by the generous Wagner family .
Lost in translation	Who knew the United Nations building would be the star of this film ? As directed by Sidney Pollack , the movie is a thriller that capitalizes in the world of diplomacy that takes place in that world body located on the East River in New York . The adaptation by Brian Ward of the Martin Stellman book , takes the viewer behind the scenes at the United Nations . The basic flaw with the screen play lies in the dual citizenship of Sylvia Broome , as the adapter , or perhaps the author of the original story seems confused about how to deal with the fact that Sylvia is an American citizen . Yet , at the end , we learn she " has been asked to leave " , something that contradicts a previous scene in which the chief of security of that African nation questions Sylvia , against her wishes and having obtained no permission to do so because of the fact she is an American citizen . The film , as seen through Mr . Pollack's eyes , is great fun to watch even if the plot , at times , doesn't make a satisfying movie . In comparison , Mr . Pollack's own " Three Days of the Condor " , accomplished much more than with this one . The film will not disappoint because of the great views of the General Assembly building and other United Natiions sites . Having been inside , attending different debates , as an spectator , the film was a reminder of great world leaders that have spoken in that international venue . Sylvia Broome , the young translator is at the center of the story . She has heard of a threat one night , when no one is supposed to have been around , to what appears to be the assassination of an African despot that will be talking to the General Assembly in a few days . Enter agents Keller and Woods , the special trained government officers that deal with the protection of foreign dignitaries . Keller is a man that is trying to deal with the sudden death of his deceiving wife a few days before he comes into the picture . The whole security team gets into action and we are taken to witness the preparations . There is someone trying to kill Sylvia as she drives her motorcycle around the city . Keller doesn't believe what this young woman saw , but soon realizes she has told the truth . Keller keeps discovering things from her past that makes her appear as though she has an agenda of her own being from that African country where the tyrant is from . Her intervention in several freedom rallies doesn't help her either . The film is packed with action . The chase that takes place in Brooklyn and involves Sylvia boarding a city bus to talk to a an opposition member , ends up in tragedy that Sylvia manages to escape . Nicole Kidman , as the translator , has one of the best opportunities in her distinguished career to shine . Under Mr . Pollack's direction , Ms . Kidman responds in excellent fashion . Her Sylvia is quite something to watch . Sean Penn , on the other hand , plays a Keller a man suffering from insomnia . Mr . Penn gives a mannered reading to this man that can't accept what fate has dealt him . He appears to be sleep walking in most of his scenes . This is not one of Mr . Penn's most felicitous appearances in front of the camera , and one wonders if it was because of problems with the director , or just a lapse in Mr . Pollack's judgment about this character . The international cast put together responds well to the director . One casualty is the enormously talented Catherine Keener , who has little to do . Jesper Christensen , Yvan Attal , Earl Cameron and George Harris are seen in minor roles . While Mr . Pollack has done better , this film will not disappoint his avid fans .
On the road of discovery	This film reunites the director , Eduardo Mignogna , and its star , Norma Aleandro . Having recently shown on cable , and not having a clue about what to expect , we took a chance in watching " Cleopatra " , a confusing title because it has nothing to do with the Egyptian queen . The previous film , by Mr . Mignogna , " Autumn Sun " , in which Ms . Aleandro played , is my humble opinion is a more polished work . " Cleopatra " is also the name of the main character in the film . She has been a teacher until recently , when she was forced to retire by a reduction in force . Her husband , Roberto , also lost his job in similar circumstances . Where Cleo tries to look for other things to do , Roberto gave up on life as a depression takes hold of him . When we first see Cleo , she's on her way home , sitting in an underground train . She falls asleep and misses her stop . To make matters worse , she must face her daily reality at home with an unresponsive husband , who , for all practical purposes , isn't there , at all . We learn that Cleo and Roberto have two grown up children , both living abroad because of the lack of employment at home . Her secret desire has been to become an actress , but she never pursued her dream . Cleo goes to audition at a television studio , but fright gets hold of her and she freezes in front of the camera . In the ladies room she meets Sandra , a soap opera star who is kind to Cleo . Sandra ends up taking Cleo home . The next day both decide to go on the road in a voyage of adventure and self discovery that will change both women forever . This is basically the premise of this Argentine road movie . The main interest in watching it is Norma Aleandro . This excellent actress of screen and theater , gives a nuanced performance as the middle aged woman who finally lets everything go to begin a new life . Ms . Aleandro is at times clever , sometimes confused , in her interpretation of the character . Ms . Aleandro is at her most charismatic self playing the title role . Equally effective is Natalia Oreiro , a gorgeous new face , as far as this viewer is concerned . She plays the young woman that is at a crossroads in her young life . Evidently , she has lived an emotional roller coaster up to now and wants nothing of that life . When Carlos , played by Leonardo Sbaraglia , stops for the women , by now stranded after a minor accident , Sandra begins to realize there is more to life than what she has been able to experienced so far . The film offers magnificent views of western Argentina . The province of Mendoza is captured by the director in all its beauty . The film sometimes feel flat , and of course , one has to make concessions in the sudden transformation of Cleo , from a meek housewife , into an adventurer who discovers a life she never knew existed .
Ticket to happiness	Jeff Probst tight , unassuming film was a rare find . Saw it on cable , and since this is an indie film , one has to take one's hat to the director for having made the movie . The question that came to my mind is what would anyone do with the possibility of sudden wealth , one that is achieved by ill gotten means . The question , plays havoc with Tepper , who knows what he has in his possession . His friends have no clue to what's really happening and why is the stranger , Avery , allowed to stay and participate in the card game . Tepper made a mistake at the beginning of the film when he notifies about his finding . He lives to regret it , but ultimately , his own sense of decency when all goes haywire around him , takes hold of him and he does the right thing , or does he ? The cast was very good . The action seems , at times , like a filmed stage play , but the performances by all save the film from being boring or losing the audience's interest . Erik Palladino is quite good as Tepper , the man with a conscience . Mathew Lillard , as Fish , is never dull . Ryan Reynolds and Dash Mihok round up the quartet of friends that meet for a card game . James Earl Jones is at times mysterious and a figure of pity because we all know what he must be going through , but then again , he had been playing with the quartet of friends and with the viewer . Good job by Jeff Probst .
A look at the world of David McCullough	David McCullough , the author of historical books , is shown in this wonderful documentary in a an informal conversation with us , the viewers . Mr . McCullough comes across as one's friend , or neighbor , or someone one could spend sometime with , talking about different things , not only history , which is his forte . His knowledge and common sense are tremendous . Not only that , he even sings for us ! Directed with excellent pacing by Mark Herzog , this is television at its best ! The writer who gave us " John Adams " , " 1776 " and " Truman " , has the uncanny ability to project an approachable aura that he communicates to the audience in an easy and relaxed manner that won this viewer from the start . The 93 minutes flew by and left us wanting for more . Mr . McCullough's best anecdote was about former president Harry S . Truman . The author was living in Brooklyn , at the time the ex-president was a guest speaker at the legendary St . George Hotel . Mr . McCullough was walking home and saw a crowd in front of the hotel . Asking someone about what was the occasion , he was told Mr . Truman was inside , and like all the others , he waited to catch a glimpse of the famous man . In retrospect , he tells how , even then , he knew he was going to write about Mr . Truman , something that was prophetic on his part . The novelist , who appears with his wife in the film , prove to be naturals for the camera . Their friendly personalities are the main asset of this documentary , that we highly recommend to fans of Mr . McCullough and people that want to spend some time in the company of friends .
Flowers and herbs in the garden	We saw the film in its original release . Not having seen it since then , we decided to take another view the other night , as it was a haunting piece of film-making . Thom Fitzgerald directs his own material about a family's disintegration amid an internal crisis . The film shows a family in three different epochs of their lives . The father , Whiskey Mac and his wife , Iris , are seen in their suburban home where they are raising two children . The segments are divided into chapters and all take their names from flowers and herbs . The main conflict in the film is within Sweet William , who as a teen ager is haunted by his latent homosexuality . The object of his interest is Fletcher , the school friend who isn't at all repulsed by William's advances , which are obvious . When they are caught in the act by the zealous grandmother , the family goes to pieces . Sweet William , in shame , hangs himself from a tree in the garden . This , we realize is only a symbolic way to show that like his own mother , Iris , both have fled the home in search of a more normal life . While Sweet Williams returns , completely transformed into a slender man , the mother is never heard of . The message of the film seems to be how a family secret becomes the breaking point and its demise . Whiskey Mac sees the hanging figure of his teen aged son right in the middle of the garden . It's a painful reminder that he has lost him . Rosemary ends up marrying Fletcher , who seems to be game for a sexual encounter with the present William . Mr . Fitzgerald has guided his excellent casts into giving performances that are true to life . Peter MacMeill , Kerry Fox , Chris Leavins , Troy Veinoitte , Seana McKenna , Sarah Polley , and the rest , show an understanding for the material . While this is a somewhat difficult film to sit through , Mr . Fitzgerald film deserves to be seen .
Rogue on the loose	Alfie Elkins , that irresistible roguish Cockney character , takes us into his confidence right at the start of this film , as he invites us , his audience , to follow him in this fantasy filled with sex that reflected a Mod society of London in the sixties . Alfie , by talking directly to the camera , seems to be performing asides a character would do in a play to emphasize a point . Some comments in here indicate they are an annoyance , but in fact , they enhance the charm of Alfie . He is a happy go lucky man who scores with all kinds of women , who find him , not only attractive , but hard to forget . Alfie is not bashful in telling us his sexual encounters with the women we get to meet . Lewis Gilbert's 1966 film made an impact when it was released . Watching it in the DVD format , one can clearly see the film has been preserved well . It still has a crisp look and frankly , it doesn't have that " dated " look of other films of that period . Aside from some of those 60s hair styles , seen in some of the actresses , the film looks as though it was recently shot . This is a film to relish Michael Caine in one of his best creations . As Alfie , he is never mean . He is a man who is only interested in satisfying the women he meets . This was Mr . Caine's break through film , which indicated , even then , his potential as the versatile actor one has always cherished . The women in Alfie's life show a lot of different types . Shelley Winters is at her best with her take of Ruby , the wealthy American " bird " that loves her encounters with Alfie . Millicent Martin , seen briefly , makes a fun Siddie . Vivian Merchant is Lily , the married woman who strays when she can't resist Alfie's charms . Jane Asher as Annie is excellent . Julia Foster plays Gilda , the only one to give Alfie an heir . Eleonor Bron is seen briefly . Alfie Bass is the only actor who has any extended role in the film . This is a film that reflects that sexual liberating era .
Bewitched	" Bell Book and Candle " was shown recently on cable . Not having seen it for a while , we decided to take another look at this comedy . Based on the James Van Druten's Broadway hit , which was a vehicle for Rex Harrison and Lilli Palmer in the early fifties , the film was adapted for the screen by Daniel Taradash . The film was directed by Richard Quine , who turned the play into a delightful comedy . Evidently , judging by some of the comments submitted by IMDb , the big issue seems to be the pairing of the two stars , who had collaborated on " Vertigo " , released the same year . Movie audiences didn't think anything about the age difference when this film was released . In fact , most of the aging male stars of that period were always involved with much younger women . The film set in Manhattan during Christmas is a delightful comedy that has enchanted viewers . Kim Novak was at the height of her beauty as it's clear the camera adored her no matter what was she playing . As the witch that becomes human , her Gillian is charming . James Stewart , who plays the publisher Shep ' Henderson , is also seen at his best . Mr . Stewart was an excellent comedy actor who shows in here why he was at the top . In supporting roles the wonderful Elsa Lanchester , playing Queenie , is a welcome addition to any movie , as she proves here . Jack Lemmon's Nicky Holroyd , the brother of Gillian , is also good . Ernie Kovacs is also seen as the writer Sidney Radlitch . This is an excellent way to spend a winter night at home watching " Bell Book and Candle " .
A man of God	" Nazarin " directed by Luis Bunuel presents an extraordinary view of religion in Mexico . As written by the director and Julio Alejandro , his notable collaborator , this was a film that put Mexican cinema in the international map after receiving the Grand Prix in Cannes that year . It's a disturbing film because Mr . Bunuel delves deep into what's wrong with the church . Nazarin , by all reckoning , is a saint . This young priest is seen living a life of poverty in a seedy pension of a city . He doesn't have enough for himself , but he doesn't mind parting with a coin when a beggar appears by his window asking for help . At the same time , he takes into his small room a prostitute that has been hurt in a fight with another woman . Andara , the woman repays his kindness by burning the room and the whole building ! Nazarin is seen taking to the countryside begging for food . Andara and Beatriz , two prostitutes from his old town follow him . Nazarin's life parallels that of Jesus . In fact , this saintly figure makes a case for humility . Of course , Mr . Bunuel had no religion in mind when he and Mr . Alejandro took it upon themselves to create this film . It's ironic how Spain welcomed him after this film was released because they saw it as showing Christian qualities , when in reality , this is an acerbic satire on the catholic church and its ministers . Francisco Rabal , the Spanish actor , makes a wonderful Nazarin . This was one of his best roles . Mr . Rabal worked extensively in his native country , but also in Mexico and Argentina . Rita Macedo , as Andara , is also excellent . Marga Lopez also makes a valuable contribution with her portrayal of Beatriz . A great film by one of the cinema's master film makers : Luis Bunuel .
Mike Hammer , detective	Robert Aldrich was a no-nonsense film director . When he undertook the direction of this film , little did he know it was going to become the extraordinary movie it turned out to be . The fame seems to have come by its discovery in France , as it usually is the case . Based on Mickey Spillane's novel and adapted by Al Bezzerides , the movie has an unique style and it's recommended viewing for fans of the film noir genre . Right from the start , the film gets our imagination as we watch a young woman running along a California highway . That sequence proved Mr . Aldrich's ability to convey the idea of a disturbed young woman that seems to have escaped from a mental institution . The plot complicates itself as Hammer learns that Christine , the young woman , has died . He decides to investigate , which is what he does best . Some excellent comments have been submitted to this forum , so we will not even try to expand in the action but will only emphasize in the tremendous visual style Mr . Aldrich added to the film , which seems to be its main attraction . For a fifty year old film , it still has a crisp look to it thanks to the impressive black and white cinematography of Ernest Lazlo , who had a keen eye to show us Hammer's world as he makes it come alive . The great musical score by Frank DeVol fits perfectly with the atmosphere of the L . A . of the fifties . Ralph Meeker made an excellent contribution as Mike Hammer . He dominates the film with his presence . Albert Decker , Paul Stewart , Miriam Carr , Maxine Cooper , Fortuno Bonanova , and especially Cloris Leachman , in her screen debut , make this film the favorite it has become . Fans of the genre can thank Mr . Aldrich for making a film that didn't pretend to be anything , yet has stayed as a favorite all these years .
Fiddler on the mountain	The lives of peasants living in a remote Mexico village are examined in this marvelous film by director Francisco Vargas . The situation parallels , in a way , the conflict in that country that has been in the news for a few years . As the film opens one can see a prisoner being tortured by a soldier . The scene changes to a bucolic setting in which an old man , his son , and grandson are seen boarding a makeshift truck transporting them to a nearby town . The older man , Plutarco , is a violinist and his son , Genaro , plays the guitar . They play for patrons at a restaurant for tips which the grandson , Lucio collects . With their meager earnings they get to eat . One thing is established , Genaro is part of the rebels that are fighting in the mountains nearby . The story changes quite drastically as the men go back to their village . There are soldiers everywhere setting their town on fire . Genaro , who is involved with the rebels flees to a safer place , leaving the older man and his son to fend for themselves . Plutarco wants to help his son but because he must travel through the soldier's camp in order to go to his small piece of land , he becomes the object of curiosity as the fiddler who becomes a figure of amusement for the commander of the troop . Plutarco's violin will become key to the story , as is his relationship with the top army man will be put to a test . Plutarco and Genaro will be together at the end . These men , like most of their friends and neighbors seem doomed because the unfair way life dealt with them . " El violin " is an unique film in which poverty and necessity have made the peasants take things into their own hands trying to get rid of the oppressing and ruthless soldiers that keep them down . It seems that the poor men one sees are part of people that are kept in poverty throughout different generations . The peasants get our admiration for being noble and having to put up with conditions no human being should have to face . The acting is excellent in general . Best of all , Angel Tavira , who is seen as the proud and stoic Plutarco . One can see in this man's eyes a distinct hatred for the men that keep him down , yet , he makes a fatal mistake that will prove fatal . Gerardo Taracena has some good moments as Genaro and Gilberto Palacios appears as the commander . One of the best achievements in the film is the crisp black and white cinematography of Martin Boege and Oscar Hijuelos . This is a major triumph for Francisco Vargas who has created a satisfying story about the oppressed people from Mexico .
Times Square according to Damon Runyon	Damon Runyon's world of Times Square , in New York , prior to its Disneyfication , is the basis for this musical . Joseph L . Mankiewicz , a man who knew about movies , directed this nostalgic tribute to the " crossroads of the world " that show us that underside of New York of the past . Frank Loesser's music sounds great . We watch a magnificent cast of characters that were typical of the area . People at the edges of society tended to gravitate toward that area because of the lights , the action , the possibilities in that part of town . This underbelly of the city made a living out of the street life that was so intense . Some of the songs from the original production were not included in the film . We don't know whether this makes sense , but this is not unusual for a Hollywood musical to change and alter what worked on the stage . That original cast included the wonderful Vivian Blaine and Stubby Kaye , and we wonder about the decision of not letting Robert Alda , Sam Levene , Isabel Bigley repeat their original roles . These were distinguished actors that could have made an amazing contribution . The film , visually , is amazing . The look follows closely the fashions of the times . As far as the casting of Marlon Brando , otherwise not known for his singing abilities , Frank Sinatra and Jean Simmons , seem to work in the film . Sky Masterson is , after all , a man's man , who would look otherwise sissy if he presented a different ' look ' . Frank Sinatra is good as Nathan Detroit . Jean Simmons , as Sarah Brown , does a nice job portraying the woman from the Salvation Army who suddenly finds fulfillment with the same kind of man she is trying to save . Vivian Blaine is a delight . She never ceases to amaze as Miss Adelaide , a woman with a heart of gold who's Nathan Detroit's love interest . Ms . Blaine makes a fantastic impression as the show girl who is wiser than she lets out to be . Stubby Kaye makes a wonderful job out of reprising his Nicely Nicely Johnson .

Revenge , lies and videotapes	Ramon , the aesthetics professor one meets at the beginning of the story , is a strange man . His apartment is a mess , yet his immaculate basement is so clean that it seems incredible he is preparing to commit a heinous crime and disturb anything that is so orderly and neat . Ramon , who is first seen speaking in a prerecorded video cassette , is finally seen wearing the same shirt as in the tape . His former wife , Laura , a psychiatrist , is tied and gagged . Ramon , who has confessed as to being a serial killer , having killed nineteen people to date , wants to torture Laura for whatever pain he feels she caused to him after they divorced . He proposes a game where he would say a word and she must answer him using the last syllable of the word in a new word . If she loses , he'll pop out one of her eyes . When that happens , Laura demands a rematch . Ramon tells her if she loses now , he'll pop out both eyes . After Ramon and Laura have played their game , he is shown at the college where he is teaching his philosophy class . Two police inspectors come to interrogate him about Laura's disappearance . At first Ramon is cool and collected . He doesn't get ruffled as questions about his actions are thrown at him . In a final sequence Laura , who by now has become emboldened because she figures he has gotten the best of him by using psychology , questions him about the murders he had confessed . It's clear he has not been telling her the truth , but what emerges is the fact Ramon's frame of mind when Laura asks him about his mother and his liaison with a male student . " Palabras encadenadas " is a psychological thriller based on a theatrical play by Jordi Galceran and adapted by its director , Laura Mana , whose work in this film shows a sure hand and a noted improvement on some of her previous work . Although it feels like a deeply felt staged play , there are moments of great intensity in the cat and mouse play Ramon plays with Laura . The best thing in this film is Dario Grandinetti . He is in total command and he lets the viewer know from the start . This actor gets better and better all the time . He gives an intense performance that is hard to imagine any other actor playing this part . Goya Toledo , is seen as Laura . She also has wonderful opportunities where to shine . Fernando Guillen and Eric Bancatto , appear as the police inspectors investigating the disappearance and possible murder of Laura . This is a highly polished film from Laura Mana .
Lunar landscape	" Japanese Story " is one of the saddest films in recent memory . This film came and went , practically unnoticed , despite favorable reviews in the local media . When we tried to see it , it had already disappeared from the screens in the city . We recently caught up with it thanks to a month long tribute to Toni Collette by one of the cable channels . It was worth the wait , although , this film , directed by Sue Brooks with a screen play by Alison Tilson , is not for everyone . For all practical purposes " Japanese Story " could have been set on the moon . The Pilbara desert in Australia has been captured by the glorious cinematography of Ian Baker to create a surreal atmosphere in the development of the story . Also , the oriental themed background music by Elizabeth Drake gives the film a Japanese flavor that is never distracting ; the music score sets the tone for the story . This is a story of contrasts of cultures . Sandy Edwards , the geologist that is sent to accompany the visiting Japanese son of a wealthy Japanese industrialist , is reluctant to serve as tour guide . The areas this visiting man wants to see are remote and isolated ; it might have been in the moon , for all it matters , as we don't see a soul anywhere . Basically , the story offers different viewpoints on the visiting Tachibana Hiromitsu . The Japanese are seen as the people that have come to own a great deal of Australia . Some others will never forget the WWII days , when Japan was the enemy . For his part , Tochibana is in awe of a land that is so vast and so underpopulated , in sharp contrast with the density of his home land . This mismatched couple begins a journey that will bring them closer together , overcoming the initial dislikes . In the process , they both will discover things about the other person in a way that will make them come to like one another in more ways than expected . An ironic twist , about two thirds into the movie , comes unexpectedly . It jolts us from the idyllic friendship and romance we see Tachibana and Sue develop into a state of complete disbelief . How could this have happened ? It's a way for life interfering in a doomed relationship that wasn't meant to be . The acting is superb . The charismatic Toni Collette does one of her best work in this movie . Ms . Collette is totally credible as this geologist that , after experiencing bliss , must face a reality she didn't bargain for . Gotaro Tsunashima , is perfect in his role . Mr . Tsunashima is at times puzzling , as well as likable , in his take of Tachibana , the man who loses his heart to the magnificent landscape and to Sue for liberating him from a rigid life dictated by honor and responsibilities . While " Japanese Story " is not for everyone , it's worth a look because of the two stars and the magnificence of the Australian landscape .
Movie fans circa 1940s	" The Youngest Profession " is a rarity , in that it seems to have been forgotten after it served its purpose . It's not a total waste . The comedy is light and earnest and has an excellent performance by Virginia Weidler , who as Joan Lyons , is at the center of the action . The film , directed by Edward Buzzell offered a view of an America at war where movie stars were adored by fans like Joan and her set . The film offers delightful cameo performances by some of the MGM stars of that time . Notably , Greer Garson , Walter Pigeon , Lana Turner and Robert Taylor , who appear as themselves . Ms . Garson and Mr . Pigeon have the best moments as they are seen talking to Joan and Patricia naturally and never appearing condescending , or patronizing . Virginia Weidler is the main reason for watching the film . She is witty , charming , and thoroughly disarming as the teen ager who loves the bigger than life stars . Also Edward Arnold as Joan's father has a good opportunity to do what he did best . Agnes Moorehead , Marta Linden , Raymond Roe , Jean Porter , among others , make this film a delight to watch . Sure , it's light fare , but it will surprise anyone because of the refreshing way the teen agers of the era were shown . There is such sweetness among them to make us yearn for a return to that happy era .
A bridge between two shores	The title of this film is appropriate and describes well what the outcome of the conflict will be . Gerard Depardieu , working with co-director Frederic Auburtin , take us back to a not too distant past to an easier time . The flavor of the film is typically French . It's easy to see why Mina , the ravishing looking young woman at the center of the story , seems bored with her present situation . She has married a man that is , in some ways , a loser , to her eyes . Georges doesn't seem to share the same interests Mina , especially for the movies . Georges , an unemployed man , prefers to spend his time at the local pub , playing cards and drinking . As a couple , one wonders what has kept them together so long . She is a beautiful woman and it's hard to see what attracted her to Georges . Mina , on the other hand , jumps at the offer she gets from Claire , a wealthy woman in her town , who offers her a job as a housekeeper . When she meets Matthias , Mina loses all inhibitions and becomes involved with this man that is the opposite of her husband . Tommy , the son , plays a significant part in the affair . Mina has involved him from the start ; this young man , instead of being horrified by what his mother is doing , shows a perverse side when he goes along in keeping his mother ' secret . The last scene of the film offers a poignant reflection on the movie in that Mina and Georges ' separation is permanent , as their lives have taken them in different directions . Carole Bouquet is a gorgeous woman . By pairing her opposite Gerard Depardieu , the contrast is even more evident . Despite of the costumes she is made to wear , one can see in her Mina an elegance that tells us she does not belong in this marriage , or this town . Mr . Depardieu's Georges is a man that reacts with resignation to the break up . By being philosophical , after trying to reason with Mina , he conveys to us that he knew this would come as their relationship went nowhere . Charles Berling , is seen as Matthias , an engineer who is in charge of the construction of the bridge . He is a married man , who will probably will end the affair and go back to his wife , as most of these romances have a certain time span . Stanislas Crevillen , plays young Tommy . This boy shows a cruel side toward his father , although nothing seems to be wrong in their relationship . This film has elicited some negative comments in this forum , but in spite of that reaction , the movie will be appreciated for the frankness in which these people tell one another where they stand and for not beating around the bush in denying or hiding the truth . Adultery , after all , is a fact of life that shows its ugly face in all types of society .
In search of the perfect wave	Dana Brown , the son of legendary film maker Bruce Brown , continues the family tradition with his own take on the world of people that are totally committed to ride those waves , no matter where . In a way , this is another installment in the way Brown sees the world of the surfers as he takes us all over the world to show us what people will do in order to discover the perfect wave , and ride it . The brilliant cinematography is amazing to watch . Things obviously have improved greatly since Bruce Brown pioneered this genre of documentary . We get glimpses of Oahu , with its rugged coast and giant waves . We are taken to places like Rapa Nui , Ireland , Viet Nam and even Sheboygan , Wisconsin , where we had no idea people will go to their rough lake to surf ! Someone made a comment about the title being pretentious , but in reality , the line comes right from one woman that is being interviewed and says she feels like " stepping into liquid " whenever she is surfing . The film is beautiful to watch . It could have used some editing , but in general Dana Brown ought to be congratulated by what he has captured on camera for fans of the sport and just plain folks that will be , no doubt , wowed by what they see on the screen .
Fat , or big ?	The actions of two men on a drunken spree turns out to be fatal for the man who is being harassed because he dies as a consequence of a fight with his two tormentors . Both men are apprehended and condemned to die as punishment for their actions . The way to die is beheading by guillotine , or " the widow " in the vernacular . Thus begins this story that director Patrice Leconte directed , based on the screen play by Claude Faraldo . The story is set in the remote island of Saint Pierre , off the coast of Newfoundland . This is a hostile environment settled by the French . Saint Pierre boasts a lot of widows who have survived the rigors of the climate and the hard lives their husbands led . Into this milieu we find a military captain and his wife . Both are Parisians and appear to be compassionate , at heart . When Neel , the surviving drunk is brought to be kept in a cell within the military quarters of the island , the wife , Madame La , takes an interest in the man . With her husband's consent , she asks for his help in tending a green house in the premises and other errands . Neel and Madame La are at simple view , just opposites . The kindness Neel sees in her , transforms him . Madame La even goes to help him learn to read . All these actions don't sit well with the rest of the inhabitants and the people in the government who demand a guillotine is sent over and have him execute the prisoner . The film works because the brilliant performance of Juliette Binoche , who as Madame La , makes her mark in the picture . Her compassion for Neel is genuine ; in her heart she believes this man , a product of the environment in which he was born , shows qualities that no one has seen in him . Emir Kusturica , a noted film director himself , is also one of the assets of the movie . Mr . Kusturica is a large man with unkempt looks , who is totally believable as Neel . His interaction with Madame La turns from gratitude into a noble love that is not meant to be . The other principal is Daniel Auteuil who is perfect as the captain , the husband of Madame La , who is outraged by what he perceives to be the wrong punishment for the accused Neel . In spite of the menacing presence of Neel next to his wife , he trusts her as he knows her kind heart belongs to him only . " La veuve de Saint Pierre " is a great movie that will satisfy viewers in search of a different story . Patrice Leconte has directed with panache as he takes us to see the beauty of Saint Pierre , something that is so bleak , yet it's a place that has a magnetic attraction as we watch the film unfold .
Chamber music	" The Ladykillers " a delightful comedy of 1955 was one of the best films that came out of England in that period . Alexander Mackendrick , the director , had the fortune of working with the screen play by William Rose , making this a classic movie from the beloved Ealing Studios . The master plotter , Profesor Marcus , finds in Mrs . Wilberforce , the perfect landlady ! Her small home is near King's Cross station in London and so convenient for the place in which to plot the perfect caper . By using the rooms being let by the old , unsuspecting , lady , Professor Marcus realizes he has stumbled on a good thing that seems the excellent setting for the right place to be . So , Marcus pretends to want to use the space for the string quintet he leads to rehearse . What Mrs . Wilberforce doesn't suspect is that her house is being used to plot a robbery from the station . Of course , there is no such thing as a perfect crime . There is always an innocent detail that gives the criminals away . In this caper it's in the cello case that gets stuck in the door of Mrs . Wilberforce's entrance door that is the beginning of the end for the criminal gang . Alec Guinnes as Profesor Marcus had one of the best opportunities of his career . Katie Johnson , is delicious as the landlady who has no inkling of what is going on under her roof , but who at the end , seems to have profit from the surprising twist . Peter Sellers , Herbert Lom , Danny Green , Cecil Parker , are the other members of the criminal quintet . Thanks to Mr . Macendrick's direction this timeless classic will always delight viewers forever .
Hitchcock the master	This magnificent documentary captures the essence of one of the most influential and innovative directors of the last century : Alfred Hitchcock . We are in good company as the work of Mr . Hitchcock is examined by the likes of Larry Cohen , Keith Gordon , Joe Dante , Carl Franklin , Ernest Dickerson , Sean Cunningham , and the rest of notables that speak about how they regard the master of suspense himself in a pedestal because he broke ground with the films he left behind . The 24 minutes of this documentary flies by , practically , and one would like to have more and more . Alfred Hitchcock's legacy is huge and " Hitchcocked " only puts a dent in his larger than life presence . His influence can be traced to many directors , among them , Brian DePalma and Quentin Tarantino , as the most influenced by the man , himself . Jeffrey Schwartz and his team deserve praise in what they have accomplished in such a limited time . The documentary is a " must see " by all film lovers , and especially fans of Alfred Hitchcock .
On the road	This film , which we watched at the Vancouver Film Festival years ago , turned up the other night on cable . On second viewing , the film still packs quite an impact , as it still feels real . The work of Walter Salles and Fernanda Montenegro was amazing then , and still is now . This is the story about a cynic and jaded woman who resorts to do menial work and who is a small con artist herself . Dora has seen better days . She is retired now , but in order to make ends meet , she sets a letter writing desk at Rio's train station where she writes letters dictated to her by the illiterate and eager people who can't do the job as they want to communicate with distant family and friends through Dona Dora . In many cases , as it's the case with the letter she has written for Ana , she has no intention of ever sending those missives dictated to her by the unsuspecting people . Josue , the small boy , who witness the death of his mother , is wiser for his younger years than one might suspect . He sees right through Dora as a charlatan and a con woman . When Dora takes the boy home , she has no intentions of ever helping him much more than a few days . Later , upon learning about the adoption agency , she sells the boy to the unscrupulous people involved in the traffic of children for a thousand dollars without any problems . It's only when her friend Irene tells her the fate that Josue will encounter , that Dora leaps into action . Since she can't stay home without having to return her money , she takes Josue on the road . This odd couple begins the journey as complete strangers , but this voyage will make them appreciate one another and even move Dora into becoming a better woman for having the courage to do the right thing . Josue also realizes that Dora , in her own way , has been , for however short , the mother he lost in the tragic accident . Fernanda Montenegro , perhaps Brazil's best actress , is amazing as Dona Dora . She is the whole reason for seeing the movie . Her Dora is one of the best creations in her film career . This intense performer shows an actress who fully understand who Dora is and the way she would behave in the situation . Young Vinicius Oliveira is a sweet Josue , and Marilia Pera , is the kind Irene , who makes Dora see the monstrosity of what she was about to do . The music by Jacques Morelembaum and Antonio Pinto is an asset , as it adds an atmosphere to the long journey of Dora and Josue . The interesting cinematography by Walter Carvalho , shows the immensity of Brazil's interior as the odd couple go to find the little boy's father . This film is a triumph for both Walter Salles and Fernanda Montenegro .
The heat in the Sunshine State .	John Sayles ' films are always interesting . He provokes his audiences to think about what he shows on the screen . This is his latest attempt to draw our attention to the perils of overdevelopment in Florida by unscrupulous people who have nothing invested in the areas where they go to disrupt the lives of different communities , like the one presented in the film . Unfortunately , nothing changes for the better . In many cases it only brings unwanted growth , crime , tackiness in the name of progress . There are very old towns in the Sunshine State that are targeted to be sold by the locals in power as it's the case with the fictional Delrona Beach who , no doubt , are in cahoots with the developers . We can't help but wonder why would anyone in the right mind would go along with those who want to transform these laid back little towns on both Florida coasts and change them into the boring gated communities and condos that dot the landscape . The Greek Chorus led by Alan King and cronies are incredibly on target . They couldn't care less what was there before as long as they can golf every day in the immaculate courses created for their pleasure . Edie Falco is a revelation in this film . She's the one that goes in and out of the different groups with a sense of belonging to the town , obviously not making a very lucrative living out of a beach motel that has seen better days . Even though she has left the town for her own reasons she has come back to run the family business . Angela Bassett is the prodigal daughter who comes back to face her past and have a confrontation with her mother . Mary Alice plays her role of the mother with such dignity that we see right through this mother the hurt and disappointment her daughter has caused in her life . It's a joy to see both of these actresses play their parts in such a restrained manner . There are no hysterics between them , just the bitterness caused by events fate has dealt them . The rest of the cast is wonderful . Mary Steenburgen , Ralph Waite , Jane Alexander , Bill Cobbs are all perfectly cast for their roles . Again , Mr . Sayles has given us a slice of life , and in doing so , he has tackled the task with great panache .
Out of the closet and into the picture	" The Celluloid Closet " is a documentary that dares to go where others haven't gone before . Hollywood , that dream factory , has always been a magnet for the artistic gays and lesbians that have had a lot to endure and have never been recognized to the valuable contributions they have made to the medium . Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman have compiled a comprehensible account of how homosexuals have been discriminated by the industry where they have been present since the early days of silent films . In fact , movies have always attracted homosexuals who , for the sake of being in the pictures , have gone to extremes in order to work in this form of entertainment . We are given excellent background by a lot of people that explain the many intricacies these closeted individuals have endured while trying to have a career in the movies . Interviews with Arthur Laurents , Tony Curtis , Armistead Maupin , Susie Bright , Whoopie Goldberg , Jan Oxenburg , Jay Presson Allen , Gore Vidal and others , expand on the material we are watching . Lily Tomlin's narration is an asset . Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman deserve credit for their frank attempt to illustrate Hollywood's hypocritical treatment to the people who , in a way , have added to the prestige and to the artistic quality of the movies .
S-T-U-P-E-N-D-O-U-S	Jeffrey Blitz , the director of this documentary had the bright idea to show us what goes behind the scenes in this competition that some of us only see as a television news clip when it is shown as the last finalist spells the hard word correctly every year in the spring , or inside a newspaper with the picture of the winner . I didn't get a chance to see it until recently because I thought it was not going to be any good . Since I was attending a screening with a handicapped relative , and all the other films were sold out , we decided to see this one thinking it was going to be empty . Well , as we arrived early , we had our choice seats and slowly , but surely , people started to come in , to the point that all seats were taken ! This was a delightful inside view of what these teen agers go through in preparing for the competition . The kids are so charming and so alive and so much into the spirit of the contest that the viewer has more sympathy for the parents that sit in the audience . They suffer the most because for the contestants , even though it is a prestigious game , they maintain their cool even in the roughest moments . In a way it also points out to what degree some immigrant parents , especially the Indians that appear in the documentary are involved in their children's school achievements . Year after year the winner is the son or daughter of someone from either India , Pakistan , or another Eastern country that has settled here because of the opportunities these children will have in the United States . This documentary should be required viewing in schools throughout the country . Both teachers and students should benefit by watching it .
Lullaby for Broadway	Rick McKay is an invaluable source when it comes to what theater is all about . His other documentary , Elaine Stritch at Liberty , was excellent . In this new work , instead of concentrating on a single performer , he explores the best years of Broadway and the commercial theater during the era when it was at its peak . The strength of the film is the intimacy one feels whenever the stars , being interviewed , speak directly to the camera , and thus to us . It's just as if these performers are telling us their secrets . There is an immediacy that no other documentary on the subject ever projected before . In a way it is a world that is no longer here . The fact is that not only it's almost prohibitive to go to the Broadway theater , but it's also about the quality of what's being shown these days . When ticket prices for musicals go over $100 . 00 , producers can only bring to the stage only those shows that might prove to be money makers . Then , of course , there is no guarantee for commercial success . Sadly , most so called stars working in musicals these days have no voices to fill a theater . Since everything is amplified , it's as though one is listening to the cast album of the show , not to a live performance . These days producers will import a Hollywood star to do a musical for the name and possible revenue that will be generated , rather than for artistic merit . It was delightful to hear actors talking about their peers . How a Laurette Taylor , a Marlon Brando , a Kim Stanley , were admired for their talent as well as for the integrity they brought to each performance . Since theater happens whenever actors are on a stage , most of the last century's historical performances can't be appreciated because they weren't done in front of a camera . This film is a must see for theater enthusiasts .
Today and Tomorrow	This Argentine film came as a total surprise when it was shown in a cable channel recently . Alejandro Chomski has directed the film , which presents us with a young woman at a point in her life , so bleak , that appears hopeless . If you haven't seen the film , please stop reading here . The beautiful Antonella Costa , is Paula , an aspiring actress and a waitress in a restaurant . When we first meet her , she is seen in a restless state trying to get money from the ATM , without any luck . In a way , she must be expecting a miracle , knowing full well there is no money in the account . To make matters worse , the play she is seen rehearsing , will not open in a while and she loses her job at the bistro because she's been late three times , recently . The film follows Paula through the streets of Buenos Aires trying to get a kind soul to lend her money to help her pay the back rent she owes to a landlord that wants her to give him what she owes . Everyone she asks to help , can't do anything for her . Even her own father , questions her instead of being kind . In desperation , Paula goes to see a friend who is a prostitute . She feels that she will be able to get the funds she needs in order to survive by taking to the streets with this young woman . Things go from bad to worse . Everything she touches turns out to be wrong . The people she meets are predators that want their money's worth ; they all use Paula to satisfy their own needs . The only kind soul she meets appears to be Raul , the Spaniard executive , but Paula doesn't want any part of him . This film reflects the reality in Argentina in the turmoil that followed recent catastrophic government measures that left the people impoverished and unemployed because of the hard times the country was going through . That anxiety and despair is what we see in young Paula . There is not a ray of hope , which was the point Mr . Chomski , the director was trying to make . The film owes everything to one of the most amazing performances by an actress in recent memory : Antonella Costa . She is the embodiment of Paula , the young woman at the center of the story . It's painful , at times , to watch what Paula is going through in front of our eyes . Yet , the film ends with a moment of reflexion and perhaps hope , as Paula gets out of the taxi that is taking her home , after a hard night , and she faces the immensity of the river as the sun is rising in the distance . In fact , we realize at this moment that Paula and the country she represents , will survive . Watch this movie in order to see the magnificent young actress , Antonella Costa !
My kind of town !	Rob Marshall shows a great affinity for the musical genre in directing this film based on the musical by Kander and Ebb . Mr . Marshall , working with the editor , has translated the stage work into a vibrant film . There's not a dull moment in this picture . From the very beginning it starts moving with the great score of songs that are so well known by now . Almost all the actors in the movie aren't known for their singing or dancing on the stage , or on films . Yet , under the direction of Mr . Marshall , they respond to the material incredibly well . Take Rene Zellweger , the Roxie Hart of the story . In her musical numbers she comes across as an accomplished singer who , unknown to us , can also act and charm the living daylight out of anyone . Miss Zellweger is a natural for this role . She never lets us down . This is acting at its best . Ms . Zellweger has such a sweet aura around her that we can only surrender to her magnetism . How about Catherine Zeta-Jones ? She's magnificent as Velma Kelly . She has curves that are unbelievable . Her singing and dancing skills were not what brought her into the world of films , yet , she manages to create this complex character . Ms . Zeta-Jones is a gorgeous woman who keeps getting better and better all the time . The greatest revelation is Richard Gere . He is an actor who should play the bad guy rather than the romantic lead most directors cast him in . When playing an evil person , he excels . His Billy Flynn is a triumph and credit , no doubt , has to go to Mr . Marshall , who knew his leading actor had it in him to give a fabulous performance and he can sing and dance on top of that . John C . Riley , wow ! He's an actor who never repeats himself . He has such a moldable face that no matter what film , or stage work he does , he makes the role his own . You never see this great actor give a fake performance as proven in all his recent work . His " Cellophane Man " is a show stopper . Had he done it on Broadway , he probably had to do it as an encore because he is the epitome of what the character is going through at the time . The other great surprise is Queen Latifa . She has such a great voice ! . It's a shame no one has created a film to showcase her talent . She has charm to spare ; her screen presence is incredible . Great work Mr . Marshall !
Don't mess around with The Bride	Quentin Tarantino's conclusion of the " Kill Bill " films is nothing short of brilliant . He makes it clear he is a master of this genre . In fact , this new film can stand on its own , as far as the story goes . It makes perfect sense in more ways than the first installment where there was more action , but perhaps the narrative is not as clear as in this one . Mr . Tarantino is greatly helped by his choice of Uma Thurman to play his heroine . As with the other film , Ms Thurman demonstrates she is up to the task of battling whatever enemies who dare come her way . The casting is excellent . David Carradine , Michael Parks , Michael Madsen , Darryl Hannah , Bo Svenson , Gordon Liu , and the rest of the crew play well under the guidance of Quentin Tarantino . A satisfying time at the movies .
Guys and Dolls	Aki Kaurismaki's film is a metaphor about surviving the worst possible tragedy in which a man loses his mind because the brutal beating that is inflicted upon him , after which , he transforms himself into a much better person than he was prior to that moment in which fate plays the horrible trick on him . This is a film for acquired tastes of Kaurimaki's work . As a rule , his characters are people that are living outside society , as we know it , in a world of their own . Kaurismaki and his team always give us deadpan people who , at times , are hard to accept , but once the viewer falls for them , he is in for a good ride . Mr . Kaurismaki has found actors such as Markku Peltola who is the man without the past , and Kati Outinen as the Salvation Army worker who falls in love with him , not knowing what she is in for . Ms . Outinen is marvelous in her interpretation of Irma . She plays such stoic women in everything I have seen her in . She is a very good actress who tends to erase herself , but her presence is felt throughout the film . It is very interesting to see how many of the films that are nominated for the the Oscar as the best foreign film sometimes are not shown until after the awards are given , probably due to the fact of the narrow audiences they attract .
Exiles	This is the rare film that will haunt the viewer days and weeks after seeing it . It is a powerful drama that works in several levels . The acting is about the best the director could have elicited from this competent cast . Vadim Perelman has adapted the excellent book by Andre Dubus into a fine movie about a young depressed woman who has been left behind by a husband that probably grew tired of this intense Kathy . We see her crying as she talks to her mother on the phone . She lies to cover up the fact that her husband has abandoned her not knowing what will hit her next . The house where she grew up is to be auctioned by the non payment of municipal taxes . If only she would have opened those envelopes on the floor , but obviously in her distress , this woman has no sense of reality . The Iranian exile , Behrani , is a study in the denial some exiles go through in their new adopted countries . He is lying to himself , his wife and children . He cannot face reality . One sees him always pretending to be what he is not . After all these years in California , he still is a man without a home to call his own . Going back to the home land is impossible , as the new regime will probably have him executed for crimes against the same enemies that are in power right now . His life in America has taken a different turn from what he envisioned . Jennifer Connelly transforms herself into this distressed woman who cannot let go of a possession she has taken for granted . After all , she is in her home land and thinks that nothing can happen to her since she has all the rights in her court . Ben Kingsley's powerful performance as the Iranian colonel whose dreams of financial independence come to a tragic end shows such intensity that he smolders the screen every time we see him . Shohreh Aghdashloo is magnificent as the suffering wife . She works very quietly but is an incredible asset to the film . Ron Eldard as the young police officer is also very effective as the man that in trying to help Kathy gets much more than what he has bargained for . Vadim Perelman is a great find as he shows a great promise in films .
Class consciousness	Jean Renoir was a man behind this masterpiece of the French cinema . It stands as an anti-war document by itself . The incredible DVD version looks as great today , perhaps , as when the original film was released . The screen play by M . Renoir and Charles Spaak was the original model , which many other films that came later , copied and profited from . " La Grande Illusion " presents us a group of men that come together because of the war . If there were no war , none of these men would have met , let alone , would ever have crossed paths in real life . The top brass in the European armies were headed by the aristocracy . These rich classes only intermingled with their peers ; they only gave orders to their subordinates . WWII changed all that ! M . Renoir gets excellent acting from the three principals . Jean Gabin , as Lt . Marechal , shows why he was one of France's best actors . Pierre Fresnay , the aristocratic French Capt . Boeldieu , and Erich Von Stroheim , as Capt . Von Rauffenstein , his German counterpart , are amazing in the film . Together with " The Rules of the Game " , this film will always be one of the most cherished French films of all time .
