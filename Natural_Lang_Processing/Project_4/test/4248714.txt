Police Academy 3 : Back in Training	The first film deserved to be an international success , so sequels pretty inevitable , and unfortunately , like most sequels , along with all the others , it has very few things to laugh at . Basically police funding is being cut , and as a result a Police Academy must be closed . To make it , Govenor Neilson ( Ed Nelson ) is allowing two academies to compete against each other to see which one will stay in operation . Cmndt . Eric Lassard ( George Gaynes ) brings back past graduates Sgt . Carey Mahoney ( Steve Guttenberg ) , Sgt . Moses Hightower ( Bubba Smith ) , Sgt . Eugene Tackleberry ( David Graf ) , Sgt . Larvelle Jones ( Michael Winslow ) , Sgt . Laverne Hooks ( Marion Ramsey ) and Lt . Debbie Callahan ( Leslie Easterbrook ) both to help win against their rival academy run by Cmndt . Mauser ( Art Metrano ) , and also instruct and train many of the new recruits . Besides that , they have to catch a gang of robbers dressed as busboys at the marina . Also starring Tim Kazurinsky as Cadet Sweetchuck and Bob Goldthwait as Cadet Zed ( the bad guy from the previous film ) . Guttenberg is still okay , Winslow does entertain with his variety of self-made sound effects , including some scanner and throat noises , but it's pointless . Poor !
Poison Ivy II : Lily	The first film had Drew Barrymore as a very toxic girl and not much sex , the sequel is almost the complete opposite , but a completely rubbish film . I can't remember any toxic girls , but I can remember the main girl called Lily and a little more sex and nudity than the first film , but not overly exposing it like most other soft core porn films . There is no good story like the original , and no little , and I mean little , bit of nudity saves it . I usually only see films like this only for the sex and nudity content . Lily may be an attractive blonde girl , I think she had not bad tits , and she has sex with a few people , she didn't do it with any women , which might have made it more worth it . Drew Barrymore was a lot more toxic , Lily is just complete trash and utter waste of time . Poor !
Tooth	I think the reason I wanted to see this film was to see which well known faces wasted their career time , and ultimately why it is so lame , and boy did I agree with that opinion ! Basically Tom ( Rory Copus ) and Tolly ( Maisie Preston ) know that their Mom ( Smack the Pony's Sally Phillips ) and Dad ( Tim Dutton ) are having money troubles , so Tolly puts a tooth under her pillow with a wish to get more money to help them , and young fairy Tooth ( Yasmin Paige ) is the one who gives them a fortune from the entire tooth fairy bank . The story basically sees Tooth trying to set things right ; saving her boss The Rabbit , aka The Easter Bunny ( Jim Broadbent ) with the help of the kids and the other fairies , the villain Plug ( Harry Enfield ) trying to catch and prove the existence to fairies , and many other bizarre things happen . Also starring Phyllida Law as Mrs . Claus , Stephen Fry as Pedro , Richard E . Grant as Jarvis Jarvis , Vinnie Jones as The Extractor and EastEnders ' Anna Wing as Ancient Fairy . It may have had it's tiny moments of humour , but it is certainly not a great family film , and I would never recommend it . Very poor !
Meteor	This is a disaster movie from director Ronald Neame ( The Poseidon Adventure ) , but the real disaster is just how much this film sucks . Basically a comet / asteroid / meteor ( whatever you want to call it ) is heading for a collision for Earth , and obviously it could extinguish mankind if it hits . So the authorities want to combine the nuclear capabilities of both theirs and Russia's fire power to destroy the rock . People involved in the mission , in whatever way , are Dr . Paul Bradley ( Sir Sean Connery ) , Tatiana Nikolaevna Donskaya ( Natalie Wood ) , NASA's Harry Sherwood ( Karl Malden ) , Dr . Alexei Dubov ( Brian Keith ) and Maj . Gen . Adlon ( Martin Landau ) . Also starring Trevor Howard as Sir Michael Hughes , Richard Dysart as Secretary of Defense , Henry Fonda as the President and Roger Robinson as Hunter . What makes this film so awful is there is hardly any effort in the acting , well , they kept their faces straight . There's that ridiculous scene where everyone is getting covered in mud in the subway , and all the model rockets and the rock are not convincing enough , because you can tell their models , especially with the crappy explosions . Just one of the most terrible films I have ever seen . It was nominated the Oscar for Best Sound ( it shouldn't have been nominated for any ! ) . Very poor !
Repo Man	It apparently had bad reviews , I'm not surprised , I couldn't understand the significance of it , why the critics give it four stars ( out of five ) , and I dozed off somewhere in the middle . The story as far as I got is that punk Otto ( The Breakfast Club's Emilio Estevez ) quits his job , and starts working with Bud ( Harry Dean Stanton ) as a Repo Man ( repossession for cars that have not been paid for ) . That's about it . I knew there was some sci-fi element because of the alien car or whatever , and at the end Otto gets in it and flies round the city , but this still wasn't enough to impress me . To be honest , as far as I saw , I'm not really bothered that I fell asleep during it , and I have no plans to watch / try it again for any reason . Pretty poor !
Thunderbirds	From Star Trek : The Next Generation star and director Jonathan Frakes ( Star Trek : First Contact ) , fans of the popular Gerry Anderson puppet show will be very disappointed by this live action attempt . In the year 2010 , whenever the world has a disaster , International Rescue , formed of the Tracy family : father Jeff ( Bill Paxton ) and his sons Scott ( Philip Winchester ) , Virgil ( Dominic Colenso ) , Gordon ( Ben Torgersen ) and John ( Lex Shrapnel ) , with a little help from Hiram ' Brains ' Hackenbacker ( Anthony Edwards ) , Lady Penelope ( Sophia Myles ) and her butler / chauffeur Parker ( Ron Cook ) , will be there to save the day in the Thunderbirds . The youngest brother Alan ( Brady Corbet ) however is left behind to watch , and not give his contribution . But he finally gets the chance when arch nemesis The Hood ( Sir Ben Kingsley ) has taken over Tracy island in order to control the Thunderbirds and rob banks . Also starring Soren Fulton as Fermat and Vanessa Anne Hudgens as Tintin . The special effects for the crafts in the Thunderbirds collection , but the film is ruined by a ridiculous story , terrible performances , and the edition of unnecessary cartoon sound effects , e . g . during fights . The original and much more fun TV series may be a kids show , but it could appeal to the adults as well , whereas this film can't , it shouldn't even be associated or mentioned alongside the TV series . Pretty poor !
The Kingdom	To be honest , I think I lost track during this film , and only the stars kept me going , but bits of this film from director Peter Berg ( Welcome to the Jungle ) were okay . Basically a terrorist detonates a bomb on an American facility in the Middle East , or Riyadh , Saudi Arabia . FBI Special Agent Ronald Fleury ( Jamie Foxx ) assembles an elite team to investigate and find the mad bomber . They are unwelcome by the Saudi authorities though , but they find Colonel Faris Al Ghazi ( Ashraf Barhom ) who helps them get around without too many problems . Eventually they realise the location of the bomber , and fighting for their on lives , they and the many strangers won't stop until justice is found in " The Kingdom " . Also starring Chris Cooper as Grant Sykes , Catch Me If You Can's Jennifer Garner as Janet Mayes , Jason Bateman as Adam Leavitt , Ali Suliman as Sergeant Haytham , Jeremy Piven as Damon Schmidt , Danny Huston as Attorney General Gideon Young , Richard Jenkins as FBI Director James Grace and Titanic's Frances Fisher as Elaine Flowers . The only interesting moments for me are some explosions , some bits of the investigation , as I said the cast , and that's about it . Adequate !
Hercules in New York	During his fame as Mr . Universe and Mr . Olympia ( winning eight times , the record for any bodybuilder ) , and before his star turn in The Terminator , Arnold Schwarzenegger debuted in this frankly silly film . Basically Hercules ( Schwarzenegger , billed as Arnold Strong ) is bored of life on Mount Olympus , and Zeus ( Ernest Graves ) expels him to Earth , where he ends up in 1960's New York . He quickly meets Pretzie ( Arnold Stang , who I've seen in Dennis , and does the voice of Top Cat ) , and with no experience of the human world , he gets into many bad situations , but with new love interest Helen Camden ( Deborah Loomis ) to help , he acclimatizes and starts to enjoy the city life . Zeus of course wants him back eventually , but after sending Pluto ( Michael Lipton ) , who takes back the message Hercules wants to stay longer , Zeus sends Nemesis ( Taina Elg ) to send him to Hell . During a test to beat Monstro ( Tony Carroll ) to see who is stronger , Nemesis instead takes Hercules ' strength , and makes him as vulnerable as any normal man . In the final battle , Hercules is saved by the arrival of Titan Atlas ( Dennis Tinerino ) and biblical hero Samson ( Mark Tendler ) , and goes back to Olympus , while Zeus decides to have his fun on Earth . Also starring James Karen as Professor Camden , Tanny McDonald as Juno , Merwin Goldsmith as Maxie and George Bartenieff as Nitro . Apparently Schwarzenegger had such a thick accent , that his voice was dubbed , I couldn't tell , I think they only chose him to flash his pecks and muscles , which he does do quite few times during . As for the film itself it didn't make me laugh , and it didn't excite me , a pretty stupid attempt at a fantasy comedy adventure . Adequate !
Swordfish	I knew this was going to be a bit of a rubbish film ( not just because the critics give it two out of five stars ) , but you have to make sure anyway . Basically it is a not too distant future relying on a lot more computer technology . The DEA shut down their dummy corporation operation codenamed " Swordfish " in 1986 , letting $400 million sit around , and compound interest 15 years later has increased it to $9 . 5 billion . Suave villain Gabriel Shear ( John Travolta ) , head of counter-terrorist unit Black Cell , wants the money to finance a vengeance war , but super-encryption has locked it away . So he hires convicted hacker Stanley Jobson ( Hugh Jackman ) to break into the government mainframes and get the money . Oh , Stanley only wants to see his daughter Holly ( Camryn Grimes ) again , but he is stopped by legal fees , and later Gabriel kidnaps her . To be honest , I'd say most people ( including me ) want to see it for Halle Berry as Ginger Knowles ( secretly working for the DEA ) in those sexy black bra and underwear , and the quick glimpse of her breasts . Also starring Don Cheadle as Agent J . T . Roberts , Vinnie Jones as Marco and Sam Shepard as Senator James Reisman . Besides the beauty of Berry , there are some other moments worth watching , e . g . explosions , gun play , a chase , and a not-to-bad surprise ending . Adequate !
Wedding Crashers	Even before it started , I was dubious of this film , and to be honest , I was right , I should have watched a better film . Basically John Beckwith ( Owen Wilson ) and Jeremy Grey ( Vince Vaughn ) are business partners and lifelong friends who share a truly unique springtime hobby - crashing weddings . They basically pretend to know the bride or groom , or whatever ethnicity , watch the proceedings as if they were real guests , then at the reception manage to chat up some beautiful female guests with their clever back stories , and have their ways with them . Then the mother of all weddings comes along , the marriage of the daughter of Treasury Secretary William Cleary ( Christopher Walken ) and wife Kathleen Cleary ( Live and Let Die's Jane Seymour ) is getting hitched . When they get into the wedding , they set their eyes on bridesmaids Claire ( Mean Girls ' Rachel McAdams ) and Gloria Cleary ( Isla Fisher ) . Both have problems with their choices , John sees that she already has a boyfriend and fiancée-to-be , and Jeremy is with a virgin , but sex obsessed virgin ! Jeremy is desperate to get out of the scheme , but John is obviously in love with his choice , so they have to stick around with the family so John can get her to fall for him , and Jeremy meanwhile has to suffer all the embarrassments of the family . They are eventually found out by the bastard boyfriend Zachary ' Sack ' Lodge ( Bradley Cooper ) to be wedding crashers , but at the real wedding of Jeremy and Gloria ( yes , he really did fall for her eventually ) , John expresses his feelings for Claire in front of the congregation , and gets William's blessing . Also starring Patch Adams and Road Trip's Ellen Albertini Dow as Grandma Mary Cleary , Henry Gibson as Father O'Neil , Ron Canada as Randolph , Keir O'Donnell as Todd Cleary and Will Ferrell as Chazz Reinhold . It had it's very , very small interesting and giggly moments , such as Gloria masturbating Jeremy under the table while they have dinner , but's it's not a film I'd see more than once , i . e . never again . Adequate !
The Land Before Time II : The Great Valley Adventure	If the kids liked the first film , then they will like the straight to video sequel . Personally I found it corny in places , but it does have an interesting story . The dinosaurs have made it to The Great Valley and are living there with their parents , Littlefoot by the way is living with his grandparents . The Valley has now got two dinosaurs stealing eggs from nests , one egg belonging to a Sharp Tooth . This Sharp Tooth , Chomper , is found by Littlefoot and he is trying to make him a nice T-Rex to be a friend to the other friends . The Sharp Tooths obviously get in the Valley and , chase out the egg thieves and the good dinosaurs block their entry . Kids will like it , I'm not sure I'd want to see it again . Adequate !
The Lawnmower Man	Apparently this film was vaguely based on a short Stephen King novel , and I did see an image from the film in a book about special effects , I think it was the leading James Bond actor that attracted me . Basically ( possibly in a near future ) Dr . Lawrence Angelo ( Pierce Brosnan ) works for Virtual Space Industries trying to make chimpanzees more intelligent using drugs , and virtual reality , but one of them escapes and he is forced out pretty much . He didn't get the chance to prove or perfect it to work on humans , but he believes he can turn his simple minded gardener , aka " the lawnmower man " of the title , Jobe Smith ( Jeff Fahey ) into a more intelligent being . Jobe agreed to it , and slowly he shows good improvement in intelligence , but of course it turns into a Frankenstein theme when he develops the ability to move objects , his voice sounds more like a computer , and he has turned evil . In the end he is defeated by his creator in the virtual world . Also starring Jenny Wright as Marnie Burke , Mark Bringleson as Sebastian Timms , Geoffrey Lewis as Terry McKeen , Jeremy Slate as Father Francis McKeen , Dean Norris as The Director , Colleen Coffey as Caroline Angelo , Jim Landis as Ed Walts , Troy Evans as Lieutenant Goodwin and Rosalee Mayeux as Carla Parkette . The special effects for 1992 I suppose are quite good , but I almost lost track of what is going on a couple of times , so not one I'd bother with again . Okay !
Get Shorty	Most of this film is a bit confusing to understand and just the tiniest bit pointless , and unfortunately not all of it makes me laugh . But there are moments of interest when the stars are talking about the nature of films . Golden Globe winning John Travolta as Chili Palmer is pretty good at being serious about making the film , Get Shorty , Gene Hackman was okay as Harry Zimm , Rene Russo as Karen Flores hardly did much , Danny DeVito as Martin Weir is a good actor who played Napoleon and plans to star in this film and Delroy Lindo as Bo Catlett is pretty good too . Altogether this is a weird " comedy " from Men in Black director Barry Sonnenfeld . It was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Screenplay and Best Motion Picture - Comedy / Musical . Adequate , in my opinion !
The Texas Chainsaw Massacre	I can't remember all of the original , apart from thinking it was quite poor ( I need to see it again to confirm that ) , but I do know they've completely reworked the story . They have the same format of five teenagers : Jessica Biel as Erin , Jonathan Tucker as Morgan , Erica Leerhsen as Pepper , Mike Vogel as Andy and Eric Balfour as Kemper , and they are confined to a location near the road . On the way , a girl who escaped something shot herself in the mouth after she realised they were going in direction of what she had already faced . Anyway , later we discover the old house with Thomas Hewitt ( Leatherface ) ( Andrew Bryniarski ) and his terrifying family living there , all involved in sick and twisted torture of victims , taking their body pieces . Also starring Full Metal Jacket's R . Lee Ermey as Sheriff Hoyt . There is still the slamming of a victim with a large hammer , a victim put on a hook and the infamous chainsaw weapon , but in this film , you actually see some blood , including great moments of Leatherface cutting his leg , and Erin chopping one of his arms off ! Look out for the severed head of idiot film critic Harry Jay Knowles from Ain't It Cool News . Okay !
U . S . Marshals	I will be completely honest , I didn't see the entire film , so I was judging it purely by critics two out of five stars , which now seeing it , I still agree with , but it is worth a go . Basically Tommy Lee Jones reprises his Oscar winning role ( from The Fugitive ) of Chief Deputy Marshal Samuel Gerard , who is this time trying to catch another fugitive , Mark J . Sheridan ( Wesley Snipes ) , who escaped from a prisoner plane crash . Along with his crack team , including Deputy Marshal Cosmo Renfro ( Joe Pantoliano ) , Deputy Marshal Bobby Biggs ( Daniel Roebuck ) , Deputy Marshal Noah Newman ( Tom Wood ) and Deputy Marshal Savannah Cooper ( LaTanya Richardson ) , assigned to help recapture Sheridan is Special Agent John Royce ( Robert Downey Jr . ) . Sheridan meanwhile is trying to find out the identity of the man who set him up for murders he did not commit ( not on purpose anyway ) . Also starring Irène Jacob as Marie Bineaux ( Mark's Girlfriend ) and Kate Nelligan as United States Marshal Catherine Walsh . I think the main reason this sequel isn't as good as The Fugitive is because it copies it too much , probably not intentionally , and the story is not as gripping , even with good actors like Jones , Snipes and Downey , Jr . The only good sequences in my memory are Jones in the chicken suit , the plane crash , Jones chasing Snipes till he lands on a train , finding out Downey , Jr . is a bad guy , and that he set up Snipes . Okay !
Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree	This was the very first adventure based on the famous children's books from Walt Disney animations , when I was younger this used to be very good . Winnie the Pooh , the bear with little brain , lives in the Hundred Acre Wood with many friends including , Rabbit , Eeyore , Kanga and Roo , Owl and Christopher Robin . No sign of Tigger or Piglet though . Anyway , in this Pooh runs out of honey and notices a honey tree . He is trying everything he can to get some honey from the tree . But he instead gets it from Rabbit and ends up stuck in his front door . Kids will obviously love this cartoon for the cute and cuddly Pooh bear , and a very good story . Winnie the Pooh was number 55 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons . Woeth watching !
Ali	From director Michael Mann ( The Last of the Mohicans , Collateral ) , I hoped this would be a good biographical drama with a great star playing one of the world's best known boxers . The film tells the story of Muhammad Ali ( Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Will Smith ) , aka Cassius Clay / Cassius X , who in 1964 won the heavyweight title , creating anew image for African American sportsmen . The film then follows his journey competing in many other fights with self confidence and belief that he is the best boxer in the world , his two marriages , his conversion to the Islam religion , a relationship with Malcolm X ( Mario Van Peebles ) , and concluding with the monumental fight against George Foreman ( Charles Shufford ) . Also starring Jamie Foxx as Drew ' Bundini ' Brown , Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Jon Voight as Howard Cosell , Ron Silver as Angelo Dundee , Casino Royale's Jeffrey Wright as Howard Bingham , Mykelti Williamson as Don King , Jada Pinkett Smith ( Will's wife ) as Sonji , Nona Gaye as Belinda Ali , Michael Michele as Veronica Porche , Terminator 2's Joe Morton as Chauncey Eskridge , Paul Rodriguez as Dr . Ferdie Pacheco ; Giancarlo Esposito as Cassius Clay , Sr . ; LeVar Burton as Martin Luther King , Jr . , Albert Hall as Elijah Muhammad , Michael Bentt as Sonny Liston , James N . Toney as ' Smokin ' Joe Frazier , Barry Shabaka Henley as Herbert Muhammad , Ted Levine as Joe Smiley and Star Trek : The Next Generation's Michael Dorn as Black Pilot . While Smith does a very convincing impression of Ali , and a nearly unrecognisable Voight does well too , it doesn't really focus on all events in a lot of detail , apart from the fights , so I agree with the critics that it is a pretty ordinary film . It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score for Lisa Gerrard and Pieter Bourke . Will Smith was number 51 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars . Worth watching !
Supervixens	This isn't one of those thriller type films filled with mainly sex and nudity scenes , it is a pretty amusing comedy filled with it . It kind of a mix of Carry On and Confessions comedy , but with more sex and nudity and directed by the quite obsessed ( with big breasts ) director Russ Meyer . I don't know or care if there is a story involving the stupid main guy , but the point of the film I think is that pretty much everywhere this guy goes has a woman either with her clothes off , or wanting to shag him . I think there is some kind of super girl with some powers called Super Vixen , but it's more likely that all girls in the film are Supervixens . Filled with loads of scenes with big breasts , some good arses and plenty of comedy like sex , this is probably better than Carry On or Confessions combined ( in terms of nudity ) . Good !
Half Ton Man	This was part of the Bodyshock programmes on Channel 4 , and it was just terrible seeing what someone could do to themselves . I did not really know that food could be so addictive , and that people like Patrick Deuel can't fill their stomachs too quickly . Basically the shock of this documentary was the size and weight of Patrick , but he is not the only one . This documentary also focused on the lives of Michael Hebranko and Richard Simmons . There was also a really fat woman who lost at least 5 eighth's of her weight and was in the record books . I sometimes think that I need to exercise more to get rid of my flabby stomach , I think I'm right . Patrick ( and some other's in his condition ) is still alive , but it is a question of how long for . Good !
Scary Movie	As soon as the Scream trilogy had ended , in a really disappointing way , they were trying to think of another idea for a scary movie , and they did , a spoof from the Wayans brothers . Originally Scream was meant to be called Scary Movie . This movie spoofs and quotes many scary and well known films , TV shows and well known media moments , including : The Scream Trilogy , I Know What You Did Last Summer and I Still Know , The Blair Witch Project , The Sixth Sense , The Matrix , Murder on the Orient Express , Grease , Halloween and Halloween H20 : 20 Years Later , the first three Friday the 13ths , A Nightmare on Elm Street , Die Hard , Baywatch , Twin Peaks , Pulp Fiction , The Shawshank Redemption , The Usual Suspects , Kids , Xena : Warrior Princess , Buffy the Vampire Slayer , Men in Black , Titanic , Amistad , Spice World , Dawson's Creek , Cruel Intentions , Drop Dead Gorgeous , American Pie , American Beauty , Fight Club , Trigger Happy TV , Final Destination ; Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon and the " Wussup " Budweiser adverts , though some are not as obvious as others . Starring Anna Faris as Cindy Campbell ( Scream's Sidney ) , American Pie's Shannon Elizabeth as Buffy Gilmore ( Last Summer's Sarah Michelle Gellar ) , Regina Hall as Brenda Meeks , Jon Abrahams as Bobby Prinze ( Scream's Billy ) , Lochlyn Munro as Greg Phillippe ( Last Summer's Barry ) , Shawn Wayans as the great gay Ray Jones , Marlon Wayans as the great smashed Shorty Meeks , Baywatch's Carmen Electra as Drew Decker ( Scream's Drew Barrymore ) , Cheri Oteri as Gail Hailstorm ( Scream's Gale Weathers ) , director Keenen Ivory Wayans as Slave in Amistad 2 trailer and a brief appearance by James Van Der Beek as Dawson Leery . If you are looking for relief from screaming too much , or you just like a bit of slapstick mixed with dumb characters , then this is definitely for you . Worth watching !
mash	From the director of Gosford Park , this is an interesting film mixing war and comedy , but not exactly providing that much action . Golden Globe nominated Doanld Sutherland as Capt . Benjamin Franklin ' Hawkeye ' Pierce , and his gang , including BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Elliott Gould as Capt . John Francis Xavier ' Trapper John ' McIntyre , Alien's Tom Skerritt as Capt . Augustus Bedford ' Duke ' Forrest , Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Sally Kellerman as Maj . Margaret ' Hot Lips ' O'Houlihan and Robert Duvall as Maj . Franklin Archimedes ' Frank ' Burns are in the Korean War , but don't exactly have a big part . They are at the Mobile Army Surgical Hospital , and there is no plot as such , just a series of episodes from individual characters . It won the Oscar for Best Writing , Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium , and was nominated for Best Film Editing , Best Director and Best Picture . I don't remember all that happens , but there are amusing parts , and it did eventually turn into a TV series . It won the Oscar for Best Writing , Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium , and it was nominated for Best Director for Robert Altman , Best Film Editing and Best Picture , it won the BAFTA for the UN Award , and it was nominated for Best Direction , Best Film Editing , Best Sound Track and Best Film , it won the Cannes Film Festival Golden Palm Award , and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical / Comedy , and it was nominated for Best Director and Best Screenplay . It was number 22 on The 100 Greatest War Films , it was number 22 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films , it was number 7 on 100 Years , 100 Laughs , it was number 56 on 100 Years , 100 Movies , and it was number 73 on The 100 Greatest Films . Worth watching , as far as I can remember !
Saw IV	Of course this can't be as good as the first two , but is certainly an improvement from the inadequate Saw III , from Saw II and III director Darren Lynn Bousman . The film opens with the corpse of the infamous John ' The Jigsaw Killer ' Kramer ( Tobin Bell ) having an autopsy ( you need a strong stomach to watch ) , and when they open his stomach , they find a tape that detective forensic Hoffman ( Costas Mandylor ) plays , and it is obviously him saying that even though he's dead , his work will continue . Then we get back into the swing of things , a quick game with two victims , I'll get to that later . Officer Rigg ( Lyriq Bent , the only one left from the first film , as far as I know ) is the only one who hasn't been " tested " , and of course , he is . After being knocked out , he wakes up back in his apartment , but it is filled with clues , and tapes saying that he has an obsession with finding him , but he has to learn to let go . As you'd expect , he is on a timer , and he must follow the clues , and each trapped person he must decide whether they deserve to live or not . Eventually , he gets to the final trap , where Agent Strahm ( Scott Patterson ) , Art ( Justin Louis ) and still living Eric Mathews ( Ransom's Donnie Wahlberg , first seen in Saw II ) are waiting . I won't give too much away , but after seeing them , he overhears Jeff ( Braveheart's Angus Macfadyen , from the previous film ) killing John , and you realise that this is before they found his body , and the opening sequence is after all this . In flashbacks , you also see the relationship of John and his ex-girlfriend Jill ( Betsy Russell ) a little before , and soon after discovering he has cancer , aka the day he became Jigsaw and wanted to test people . Also starring Athena Karkanis as Agent Perez , Shawnee Smith ( from the first film ) as Amanda , Sarain Boylan as Brenda , Simon Reynolds as Lamanna , Saw III's Bahar Soomekh as Lynn and Dina Meyer ( from the first film ) as Kerry . Much bloodier than the previous , especially the autopsy sequence , and Bell ( even being killed off ) as Jigsaw is even more icy and emotionless . Traps include : the two guys chained together to a pulling device ( one with his eyes sewn together , the other his mouth ) , the woman in a device that will pull her hair ( ripping the top of her head off ) , the man chained down on a bed who must stab his eyes to get out or get ripped apart , the man and woman held together by pipes through their bodies ( the guy dies of massive blood loss , and the woman gets out ) , Mathews standing on ice ( wth his broken ankle is a metal case ) and if he falls off he hangs himself and electrocutes Strahm , blocks of ice above that smash someone's ( I won't say who ) head in , and the man who has to push knifes across his face to release his hands . Worth watching !
Phenomenon	I recognised this film from the poster and the leading actor , but I had no idea what to expect , from director Jon Turteltaub ( While You Were Sleeping ) . Basically on his birthday , George Malley ( John Travolta ) sees a strange light come down from the sky , and hit him . No-one else saw it , and over the next few days George develops newfound intelligence and telekinesis ( moving things with his mind ) , and he uses these abilities for the good of his community . Word gets around about , and he becomes known as a freak , and everyone wants to know what happened to the old car mechanic . Soon enough the government gets involved wanting to see and understand his abilities . The only people that don't want to do anything to him , and are still good friends are Lace Pennamin ( Pyrates ' Kyra Sedgwick ) , Nate Pope ( Forest Whitaker ) and Doc Brunder ( Robert Duvall ) . Also starring David Gallagher as Al Pennamin , Ashley Buccille as Glory Pennamin , Tony Genaro as Tito , Sean O'Bryan as Banes and Independence Day's Brent Spiner as Dr . Bob Niedorf . Besides the one or two fun to watch tricks Travolta can do , this film is no much of a phenomenon , but it's okay . Worth watching !
Miracle on 34th Street	For a Christmas film this is quite a nice children's film where someone tries to prove the existence of Santa Claus , and that Kris Kringle ( Lord Sir Richard Attenborough ) is him . Kringle is hired as a Santa Clause in a local department store by Dorey Walker ( The Flintstones ' Elizabeth Perkins ) to bring more children and customers in , and it works . But there are those who hate him sometimes , especially when he suggests other stores to shop at . After a while lawyer Bryan Bedford ( Dylan McDermott ) , also in love with Dorey , wants to help Dorey's young daughter Susan ( Mara Wilson ) have a Dad , and prove that Kringle is Santa . The reason the case came up by the way was because Kringle hit someone for calling him names . They won the case because of a dollar bill with the words " In God We Trust " , I'm not sure if that is the original film conclusion . I think Attenborough and Wilson are the only reasons that this film works , but I really need to see the original . Worth watching !
Species II	The first film was always corny , but fun and a good cast , and this sequel is equally good . Basically three astronauts succeed landing on Mars , and not long after they leave they are knocked out by a creature , and for a while , you're not sure which one is infected and will mutate . Meanwhile , Dr . Laura Baker ( Marg Helgenberger , from the previous film ) and her scientists have cloned the DNA that made the previous creature ( Sil ) , and she looks exactly the same , they've named her Eve ( Natasha Henstridge , also from the first film ) , she has been made friendlier , and she is fine as long as their are no men around the facility she is locked it . You soon realise that Patrick Ross ( Justin Lazard ) is the one who is infected , the other two are fine , and that he is having numerous amounts of sex , and making many children that will eventually evolve / mature into monsters like what we've seen before . The female astronaut dies , but Dennis Gamble ( Forrest Gump's Mykelti Williamson ) is accompanies Laura , and Press Lennox ( Michael Madsen , last from the previous film ) , the hunter . Also starring Basic Instinct's George Dzundza as Colonel Carter Burgess Jr . , James Cromwell as Senator Judson Ross and Myriam Cyr as Anne Sampas . The special effects are the same as before , same with the amount of nudity ( particularly from Henstridge ) , and the gore is probably more prominent and frequent . Worth watching !
Michael	It is an interesting idea for a film , and it is the same director as Sleepless in Seattle , Nora Ephron . Basically Frank Quinlan ( William Hurt ) gets a message and photo evidence that an angel is staying with an old woman at her house in Iowa . The boss Vartan Malt ( Bob Hoskins ) is excited about this story , and says that he'll fire Frank , along with Huey Driscoll ( Eraser's Robert Pastorelli ) and dog trainer Dorothy Winters ( Four Weddings and a Funeral's Andie MacDowell ) , and get their dog , if they do not get the goods . So they travel to the house to meet the woman , and the angel , Michael ( John Travolta ) . Michael seems like a sloppy , lousy and almost childish guy with large feather wings on his back . He agrees to start a road trip ( instead of plane ) to their Chicago tabloid place , and along the way they begin to believe the angel claim . Along the way they have some giggly stops , but also ( apparently the key element to the story ) , Frank and Dorothy start to fall in love . It has quite a sad end for Michael , when after bringing the dog back to life , he dies , as he knew he would , but Frnak and Dorothy are still together . The best moments are those where Travolta is dancing . Worth watching !
Revenge of the Pink Panther	This fourth film was the last full film that the wonderful late Peter Sellers appeared in , it is also the second to last time we saw him as the excellent French detective Inspector Jacques Clouseau , the last being the failure Trail of the Pink Panther . The chief of police has some how come back and is still insane . He believes that he has killed Clouseau , but he faints every time he sees him . Clouseau's assistant Cato ( Burt Kwouk ) doesn't fight that much , he just carries luggage . Clouseau is trying to uncover a gang of dealers or something while disguised as one of them . Still the same terrific accent and recognisable theme tune by Henry Mancini . Peter Sellers was number 57 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars , he was number 22 on The 50 Greatest British Actors , he was number 7 on Britain's Finest Actors , and he was number 24 on The World's Greatest Actor . Good !
Copycat	From director Jon Amiel ( Entrapment , The Core ) this is quite an interesting murder mystery suspense thriller with two very good actresses . Basically Dr . Helen Hudson ( Sigourney Weaver ) used to be a criminal psychologist , specialising in serial killers , before she viciously attacked by Daryll Lee Cullum ( The Iron Giant's Harry Connick Jr . ) , and she now suffers agoraphobia ( panics when she tries to leave her house ) . Now a vicious killer , creating murder scenes replicating past infamous serial killers , i . e . copycatting , and detectives M . J . Monahan ( Holly Hunter ) and Reuben Goetz ( Dermot Mulroney ) are hoping Hudson can help them . Unfortunately , the killer , Peter Foley ( William McNamara ) , knows about Helen , and is constantly sending her reminders of her horrific experience , so it is a challenge for Helen . Killers copycatted by the way include The Hillside Strangler , David Berkowitz , Jeffrey Dahmer and Ted Bundy , and of course when the killer eventually gets Helen he creates the scene she was involved in . Also starring J . E . Freeman as Lt . Thomas Quinn , Will Patton as Nicoletti , John Rothman as Andy and Shannon O'Hurley as Susan Schiffer . Weaver and Hunter both have their moments , the story is obvious but certainly made to look interesting . Good !
The Muppets Take Manhattan	There are some nearly tear-jerking moments towards he end , but the rest of the film is filled with some good moments of humour , and of course , all the Muppets you need . Basically all the Muppets lead by Kermit the Frog ( Jim Henson ) decide to take their stage show , Manhattan Melodies , to New York , Broadway . It doesn't go that well for a while and they all split up to find jobs . But Kermit is still determined to sell the show to a producer , with help of Jenny ( Juliana Donald ) and her Dad , Pete ( Louis Zorich ) . There is good turnout when he does sell it to wannabe producer Ronnie Crawford ( Lonnie Price ) , with his real producer Dad , Bernard Crawford ( Art Carney ) , and there is even a wedding for Kermit and Miss Piggy , with all of the Muppets and Sesame Street invited . Also starring Henson as Rowlf , Dr . Teeth , Swedish Chef and Ernie ; Frank Oz as Miss Piggy , Fozzie Bear , Animal , Sam the Eagle , Bert and Cookie Monster ; Dave Goelz as The Great Gonzo , Zoot and Dr . Bunsen Honeydew . Steve Whitmire as Rizzo the Rat , Gill the Frog and Baby Kermit and Richard Hunt as Scooter , Janice and Beaker . With cameos by Dabney Coleman , Gregory Hines , Linda Lavin , Joan Rivers , Elliot Gould , Liza Minnelli , Brooke Shields and John Landis . It was number 49 on The 100 Greatest Musicals , and The Muppets were number 47 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons . Good !
Sooty Heights	This used to be nearly quite as good as Sooty & Co , but the sad difference was that Matthew Corbett after a long time with the puppets retired . He made the show happen , but don't worry the show isn't that bad without him . Sooty and Co now live in a Hotel called Sooty Heights . It is nearly the same kind of plot as Sooty & co as well , the main characters Sooty , Sweep , Soo and Scampy having small stories in every episode . A couple of the stories invited a new character called Butch the dog . The main host ( I can't remember his name ) was quite friendly and helpful , but personally Matthew Corbett was a lot better . The only guest appearance that I can remember was Matthew Kelly from Stars in Their Eyes as some magician guy . Good !
The Witches	You've probably read your kids this sometimes scary but lovable story book by Roald Dahl ( The BFG , James and the Giant Peach , Charlie and the Chocolate Factory ) , this is the film version of the story , with only the ending changed . Basically young Luke ( Jasen Fisher ) and his Grandma go back to England to live after his parents died , she is his guardian . Then they decide to go on a short hotel holiday after Grandma gets mild diabetes . It is in this hotel that Luke sees a terrible plan by Miss Eva Ernst , or the Grand High Witch ( Academy Award winner Anjelica Huston ) , leader of the many witches in England . They plan to cover sweets and chocolate in a special potion that will turn children into mice ! Unfortunately , this is what happens to Luke and his new friend , rich kid Bruno Jenkins ( Charlie Potter ) . Luke ( as a Jim Henson made mouse ) now plans to stop the witches by putting the potion in the soup for the " Women's Cruelty To Children " party banquet , that's obviously the witches , except not caring for kids . Also starring Jane Horrocks as Miss Irvine , Bill Paterson as Mr . Jenkins , Brenda Blethyn as Mrs . Jenkins , and bumbling Rowan Atkinson as hotel owner Mr . Stringer . It was nominated for a BAFTA Film Award for Best Make-Up . Good !
The Descent	Shaun of the Dead is funny , 28 Days Later is cool , and Creep is creepy ( obviously ) , and this British film from director Neil Marshall ( Dog Soldiers ) , is not too bad . Basically six girls , Sarah ( Shauna Macdonald ) , Juno ( Natalie Mendoza ) , Beth ( Alex Reid ) , Rebecca ( Saskia Mulder ) , Sam ( MyAnna Buring ) and Holly ( Nora-Jane No one ) who love adventure go on a holiday to explore an unseen cave . Unfortunately the exit caves in after a rockfall and they hardly have enough food or equipment . They are now trying to find a way out of the pitch black cave , and hideous flesh eating humanoid ( human like ) creatures are hunting them . Also starring Oliver Milburn as Paul and Molly Kayll as Jessica . Good !
Zzzap !	When this was on CITV ( Children's Integalactic Television ) I used to think it was one of the best entertainment shows for kids , and you could enjoy every minute of it . With the great array of characters in the large comic book activated by remote control , there was never a dull moment . These great characters and acts included the mean keen Daisy Dare , Claire Macaulay ( Deborah McCallum ) , a blue glove and yellow glove both creating something , The Handymen ( Sarah Pickthall ) , the silly almost Mr . Bean like Cuthbert Lilly ( Richard Waites ) , my favourite creative and overactive artist Smarty Arty ( Art Attack's Neil Buchanan , who also created all colourful backgrounds ) . The only one I wanted ignore was the pretty ridiculous Smarty Arty replacement , Minnie the Mini Magician ( Sophie Aldred ) . It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Entertainment . Good for kids !
The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron : Boy Genius	After the movie was made , they decided to make it a series . This is the computer animated cartoon series about a boy inventor who lives his everyday life with the gadgets that he creates . While he lives his life he comes up with all kinds of ideas for proof or for himself and others . For example , he tries to pass a history presentation , invents walking trousers and even creates his own brother called " Brobot " . He has many different adventures that include his two friends Carl and Sheen , and some that involve his " eney " Cindy . Every episode she laughs at him and his inventions , but Jimmy just tries to ignore her . At the time , and sometimes today , a good cartoon .
Falling in Love	This is a really sentimental film about how a first brief meeting , and then another few can start a bigger relationship . Starring Robert De Niro as Frank Raftis , he bumps into Meryl Streep as Molly Gilmore in a book store , and they get their wrapped books mixed up . A few months they meet each other again at the train station , and they become friends . They see each other a few more times after that , and then eventually they realise it is love , but they are both married ! It is amazing how only a few meetings turns into obsession , it is obviously when bad things happen to them both , and their marriages , that you wonder if they should be together . Also starring Harvey Keitel as Ed Lasky and Edward Scissorhands ' Dianne Wiest as Isabelle . Good !
The Wooden Horse	Long before The Great Escape , and not long before The Colditz Story was this escape story , based on real events . Basically in a Nazi PoW ( Prisoner of War ) the huts are far from the boundary so that any escape tunnel would have to be a long one . The British officers are trying to find ways to a create a much shorter , and then one day the get the idea of a daily gymnastics routine , involving a vaulting horse ( the wooden horse ) , that they can place it near the boundary and start a tunnel under it . The tunnel progresses rather well and the Nazis do not suspect anything , the officers get closer to finishing and plan to make it to Sweden . Eventually they manage to break through , and two of them head for the station . For me personally though , after these officers escape to Sweden and get past the Nazis I get lost and can't understand how they did it or what goes on , but the ending is happy with many officers in the final location with them . Starring Leo Genn as Peter , Mary Poppins ' David Tomlinson as Phil , Anthony Steel as John David Greene as Bennett , Peter Burton as Nigel , Patrick Waddington as Senior British Commanding Officer , Michael Goodliffe as Robbie and Dr . No's Anthony Dawson as Pomfret . I think the reason to watch it is the escape progressing , and the ending , when they actually get out is slightly boring and worthless , but it is still a good film . It was nominated the BAFTA for Best British Film . Good !
Ricky Gervais Live 2 : Politics	Animals being his first was very funny , Fame is pretty funny too , but this doesn't stick out as much , I mean it's funny , but to be honest , he talks more than jokes . Ricky Gervais basically does another live show ( probably fast selling ) , and this one is about how politics affects everything that happens both in the country and all over the world . I don't know where they came from , but there were some good little jokes about things like Nursery Rhymes , e . g . Humpty Dumpty , which were very good . This by the way was made not long after Gervais won Golden Globes for the successful Office , and it includes small clips of Gervais before the gig with him and his friend , don't know his name . Good !
The Madness of Boy George	This documentary created within eight months along with archive footage was a pretty interesting show of just how strange Boy George is . It is not just him being gay that makes him weird , it's his perception of life and thoughts of certain people . He said himself , " I'm living on the outside of the outside " . Thsi documentary basically showed Boy George's life as a singer solo and with The Culture Club , a DJ and recently a drug addict . He was guilty of possessing cocaine and abusing police in Britain , but more prominently in New York . He was in prison before , but he was put on community service for about a month when he was guilty of wasting police's time . A really weird guy with a good career he is wasting . Narrated by Simon Callow . Good !
Phone Booth	Director Joel Shumacher ( Falling Down , Batman Forever ) has created a good tense and gripping film . It is so simple , and yet so brilliant , the location , the stars and the story . Basically successful and quite greedy businessman Stu Shepard ( Colin Farrell ) has a secret girlfriend ( behind his wife's back ) and he has hardly a care in the world because he is so happy . Basically one day he calls his girlfriend in a not often used phone booth , and then he is recalled in this booth by an unknown Caller ( Kiefer Sutherland ) . After a little while of talking to this guy , he finds out that he cannot move , he threatens and tries , but he discovers he is trapped by a sniper . If he gets off the phone , he will be killed . When the police , including Captain Ramey ( the good Forest Whitaker ) come along , they suspect he is armed , but Ramey believes he is trapped . Also starring Radha Mitchell as Kelly Shepard and Katie Holmes as Pamela McFadden . Good !
Battle of Britain	From James Bond producer Harry Saltzman and director Guy Hamilton ( Goldfinger , Live and Let Die ) , I know this was an all-star Second World War film , I didn't really know much else . Basically Hitler is planning to bomb England , and all that stands in the way is the R . A . F . , under the leadership of Air Vice Marshal Keith Park ( Trevor Howard ) , along with Squadron Leaders Canfield ( Sir Michael Caine ) and Colin Harvey ( Christopher Plummer ) . That's pretty much the basic story , besides many looks at what the German Nazis are up to . Starring Lord Sir Laurence Olivier as Air Chief Marshal Sir Hugh Dowding , Robert Shaw as Squadron Leader Skipper , Susannah York as Section Officer Maggie Harvey , Ian McShane as Sgt . Pilot Andy , Kenneth More as Group Capt . Baker , Patrick Wymark as Air Vice Marshal Trafford Leigh-Mallory , Sir Ralph Richardson as Sir David Kelly ( British Minister to Switzerland ) , The Spy Who Loved Me's Curt Jurgens as Baron Von Richter , Harry Andrews as Senior Civil Servant , Sir Michael Redgrave as Air Vice Marshal Evill , Nigel Patrick as Group Capt . Hope , Michael Bates as Warrant Officer Warwick and A Bridge Too Far's Edward Fox as Pilot Officer Archie . To be honest , the only really interesting and eye-catching bits of the film are all the plane battles with shooting , crashes and explosions , the many stars aren't essential viewing , but it's certainly nice to see them . It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Sound Track ( the only award it was ever nominated ) . It was number 29 on The 100 Greatest War Films . Good !
Happy Birthday BAFT	I have always liked the BAFTA awards for seeing great recent film and television for being nominated for , and winning worthy awards , and to celebrate the 60th birthday of the ceremonies , there came this special tribute evening . Hosted by Michael Parkinson ( who was retiring from his chat show career ) and Joanna Lumley , this programme saw some little sketches , some dancing , some singing , and basically celebrated all the great television and film that BAFTA has praised . Shiow highlights include : Miss Piggy meeting Sharon Osbourne ( both divas ) and fighting the limelight , the cast of Billy Elliot dancing ( and singing a bit ) , Celine Dion singing " My Heart Will Go On " , the cast of Upstairs Downstairs reunited , The Kumars ( Sanjeev Bhaskar , Meera Syal , Vincent Ebrahim , Indira Joshi ) meeting Sir Ben Kingsley , Stanley Baxter , a new stand-up routine from Victoria Wood , Andrea Bocelli singing West Side Story's " Maria " , and Alexander Armstrong and Ben Miller recreating the great Morecambe and Wise Breakfast sketch . Also appearing are Melvyn Bragg , Robert Carlyle , Pauline Collins ( aka Shirley Valentine ) , and of course , Lord Sir Richard Attenborough . With some good clips from great films and television , it was a good programme . Good !
To Catch a Thief	I can agree that this is quite a good Sir Alfred Hitchcock film . I can't remember everything that happens , but I know it is all about John Robie ( Cary Grant ) , better known to others ( in secret ) as ' The Cat ' . He is a thief who gets away with almost anything and at any time . One day he meets Frances Stevens ( Grace Kelly ) and they become really good friends , I'm not sure if they were in love . Soon enough John discovers that she was trying to prove herself that he in fact a thief . That's pretty much all I can remember , apart from a couple of chases and one robbery . Hitchcock's cameo is the man sitting left of Grant on the bus . It won the Oscar for Best Cinematography , and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Costume Design . It was number 81 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments , and it was number 46 on 100 Years , 100 Passions . Good , as far as I can remember !
Space Jam	You probably remember the very clever mix of live action and cartoon animation in Who Framed Roger Rabbit , this is another quite good example of that . Basically basketball player Michael Jordan has retired from basketball and starts baseball . Meanwhile , far away in another part of the galaxy Mr . Swackhammer ( Danny DeVito ) plans to kidnap the Looney Tunes to be an attraction at his hardly popular theme park . When the five little aliens get there , the Looney Tunes lead by Bugs Bunny ( Billy West ) think its fair that they get a chance to defend themselves in a game of basketball . Soon enough however these little aliens turn into the giant Monstars . So the Looney Tunes get Michael Jordan to help them . Also starring Wayne Knight as Stan Podolak , Bill Murray , Daffy Duck , Elmer Fudd , Porky Pig , Tazmanian Devil , Sylvester and Tweety , Yosemite Sam , Foghorn Leghorn , Pepe Le Pew and Lola Bunny . Featuring fantastic songs , including Seal's " Fly Like An Eagle " , Monica's " For You I Will " , and of course , R . Kelly's " I Believe I Can Fly " . Pepe Le Pew was number 73 , Foghorn Leghorn number 61 , Daffy Duck number 30 , Looney Tunes / Merrie Melodies number 20 and Bugs Bunny number 10 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons . Good !
Carousel	I was expecting this film to be the tiniest bit cheesy , and I was right , but it is still enjoyable in places . Basically it is all about Billy Bigelow ( Gordon MacRae ) who is in a Heaven like place telling his story of how met , fell in love with and married Julie Jordan ( Shirley Jones ) at the Carousel , where he used to work . The only thing is that he pretty much ruined his life , and ended it by trying to commit a crime , which ended up with a fatal escape attempt . However , he was given the chance to see his daughter he never saw , at 15 years old , and his wife . Anyway , that is the main story , accompanied with her friend Carrie Pipperidge ( Barbara Ruick ) and her husband Mr . Enoch Snow ( Robert Rounseville ) and a load of music and dancing . Also starring Cameron Mitchell as Jigger Craigin , Claramae Turner as Cousin Nettie , Gene Lockhart as Starkeeper / Dr . Selden and Audrey Christie as Mrs . Mullin . It is a corny film , but definitely worth a try . It was number 41 on The 100 Greatest Musicals . Worth watching !
Robin and Marian	I knew a little about this film from the leading actor playing the well known stealing-from-rich , giving-to-poor hero , but that is pretty much all I knew about it , from director Richard Lester ( A Hard Day's Night ) . Basically this is set 20 years after most other versions of the story , Robin Hood ( Sir Sean Connery ) and all other merry men , including Little John ( The Wind in the Willows ' Nicol Williamson ) , Will Scarlett ( Denholm Elliott ) and Friar Tuck ( Ronnie Barker ) are ageing , and have returned from the Crusades . Robin is told that Maid Marian ( Audrey Hepburn ) is now living in the near nunnery , and when they reunite she has mixed feelings , but they become lovers once again after Robin rescues her from old enemy the Sheriff of Nottingham ( Robert Shaw ) . The ending is a little confusing when Marian decides to poison Robin and herself to die together , but I suppose it had to end that kind of way , in each other's arms . Also starring Richard Harris as King Richard , Kenneth Haigh as Sir Ranulf , Sir Ian Holm as King John , Bill Maynard as Mercadier and Carry On's Peter Butterworth as Surgeon . I can't remember there being a lot of battle sequences , and I think the love story is a little more poignant , but it is a good film , as far as I can remember . Good !
The Worst Witch	When I was younger I only watched this a little bit , I just liked the character of Mildred Hubble . Based on the popular children's books written by Jill Murphy this is the story of a clumsy member of Cackles Academy the school fro young witches . Cackles Academy was run by Miss Cackle and as far as she could see not a lot of trouble went on , until Mildred Hubble arrived . Mildred and her friends have many mini adventures making potions , spells and magic of all sorts . The teacher who suspicious of Mildred and her chums was Miss Hardbroom . Unfortunately they had to do a sequel show with a new worst witch , what's the point . Quite good , the kids will like it !
That's My Wife	Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history , and deservedly so , so I am happy to see any of their films . Stan is living with Ollie and his wife ( Vivien Oakland ) , and she wants him out otherwise she leaves , and just before she does , Ollie reminds her they will lose a fortune from Uncle Bernal ( William Courtright ) , she doesn't care . Soon enough , the Uncle is knocking on the door expecting to see the happy couple , so Ollie gets Stan to dress as a woman , his wife , and a stupid and clumsy one at that , to satisfy the Uncle and hopefully get the fortune , only to be told they have to go with him to dinner . So they go to a restaurant where Stan is still trying to look like a woman , only to have a Drunk ( Jimmy Aubrey ) trying to get his attention to flirt , and when he comes over Ollie pours soup on his head . Then Stan sees a guy swipe a necklace from a woman on another table's neck , and he drops it down Stan's back , and it is up to Ollie to try and get this object out , making them both hilariously ridiculous . In the end , the Uncle finds out the truth , and says he will give the money to a dog and cat home , and the picture ends with Ollie getting a bowl of soup on his head from the Drunk . Also starring Charlie Hall as Waiter ( possibly the one that keeps having his face going into cakes ) . Filled with wonderful slapstick and all classic comedy you could want from a silent black and white film , it is an enjoyable film . Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were number 7 on The Comedians ' Comedian . Good !
Take That Come to Town	I am a big fan of Take That ( Gary Barlow , Mark Owen , Howard Donald and Jason Orange - Robbie Williams might come back one day , you never know ) , and I really liked An Audience with . . . , so here's another similar show . They again perform some old classics , and along the way answer fan questions and other stuff . Songs of the evening included " Greatest Day " ( their latest number one ) , " Shine " , " Back For Good " , " Patience " , " Never Forget " , new track " Julie " , and a couple of their other new tracks . The show included a special guest appearance by Geraldine McQueen ( Peter Kay ) , winner of the ( spoof ) reality show Britain's Got The Pop Factor . . . to ask them questions to see how much they know about each other . Good !
Blade Runner	I haven't seen this that much , and to be honest I'm not really sure I'm going to , from director Sir Ridley Scott this is quite a good futuristic science-fiction adventure . It is 2019 in Los Angeles , and man has developed the technology to create human clones , known as Replicants , but law prohibits them ( something to do with the creation or slavery of them ) , and any left are terminated , or rather " retired " by special cops known as Blade Runners . LPD Leiutenant Rick Deckard ( Harrison Ford ) originally wanted to quit his job , but he is re-entered when five replicants have been reported to have escaped from and off-world colony . In the film , there is a love story with him and special replicant ( with emotions ) Rachael ( Sean Young ) , an investigation identifying the suspects who know about this , or are part of it , and of course the replicant villain Roy Batty ( Rutger Hauer ) trying to find a way for him and other replicants to live longer than their given times . Also starring Edward James Olmos as Gaff , Wild Wild West's M . Emmet Walsh as Bryant , Daryl Hannah as Pris , William Sanderson as J . F . Sebastian , Brion James as Leon Kowalski , Joe Turkel as Eldon Tyrell and Joanna Cassidy as Zhora . I said the last time I saw it , I needed to again top understand it , now I do , I just think it is only one of those " watch it when it's on films " , or when it's really necessary , but it is worth five stars from the critics . It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Visual Effects , it won the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography , Best Costume Design and Best Production Design / Art Direction , and it was nominated for Best Film Editing , Best Make Up Artist , Best Score , Best Sound and Best Special Visual Effects , and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score . Harrison Ford was number 5 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars , the film was number 74 on 100 Years , 100 Thrills , and it was number 8 on The 100 Greatest Films . Very good !
The Big Fat Quiz of the Year 2008	If you knew your news , events , media and happenings of the year 2008 , then this was the show that you needed to watch . Hosted by Jimmy Carr this quiz gave viewers , and the celebrities the opportunity to test their knowledge of the past twelve months . This show had celebrity guests , in teams , they included : James Corden , Sean Lock , Davina McCall , Michael McIntyre , Dara O'Briain and Claudia Winkleman . Other appearances included Alan Carr , John Hurt , Jodie Kidd , Kayvan Novak as The Fonejacker , Jon Snow and Sir Alan Sugar . A good quiz show with some good humour , good guests , a good host and a good chance to relive the year past , maybe not as funny as past ones , but great fun . Very good !
Ministry of Mayhem	This is quite a good kids Saturday morning show . It is hosted by Stephen Mulhern from The Quick Trick Show and the fit presenter Holly Willoughby . Throughout the show they have been throwing Gunge , shouting , ramming dwarfs into doors ( one made of paper ) , scaring themselves and guests , guessing ring tones with guests and obviously showing some good shows . One of the best shows on this show is Captain Scarlet . But any way , they have had some pretty good guests appearing . These include : Melanie C ( Sporty Spice ) , Joe Swash ( Mickey from EastEnders ) , Darius , Caprice and a couple of others . Quite good entertainment , I hardly watch the actual show , but bits of it are good ! The kids will love it !
Unbreakable	The first time I saw it I thought it rubbish ( somehow ) , but watching it again , I can see why it is four stars , and it is a pretty good film from director M . Night Shyamalan ( The Sixth Sense ) . The film begins with the birth of a prominent character , who almost immediately after being born broke some bones , he was born with brittle bones , easy to break . Then the story moves to security guard David Dunn ( Bruce Willis ) miraculously being the lone survivor of a mile-long train crash ( that you find out later was not accidental ) , and with no injuries what-so-ever . It is after that David meets that brittle-bone guy , Elijah Price ( Samuel L . Jackson ) , nicknamed " Mr . Glass " , who runs a comic book art gallery , and he believes not only that they have links to the truth ( and they are merely money-making media exaggerations ) , but that they are linked . He believes that David , being strong and not able to injured , is the opposite of what Elijah is , oh , and he has a weakness , water . The two scenes you can really believe this " mythology " could be true , are when David asks his son Joseph ( Spencer Treat Clark ) to keep putting more heavy stuff on exercise weights , and during a fight with a crook . Also starring Forrest Gump's Robin Wright Penn as Audrey Dunn and Charlayne Woodard as Elijah's Mother . This is quite a good film that does not hype the superhero format , and darkens it into a thriller genre . Oh by the way , it was Elijah that caused the train crash , he caused many incidents to find an opposite of him , i . e . someone that would survive . Very good !
Mr . Benn	When I was younger I didn't watch this all the time , but when I did it was quite good . Although it was basically the same setup every week , the new adventures was what I watched it for . Basically the show ( narrated and voiced by Ray Brooks , who went to EastEnders in 2006 ) is about a man called Mr Benn . Mr Benn always goes to his local costume shop . He then sees the man that appears and disappears . Mr Benn chooses a costume to try on in the fitting rooms , and the he enters a magic door that takes him on an adventure involving the costumes purpose . He's been a clown , a astronaut , a submarine person , an Arabian and many other adventures . It was number 6 on The 100 Greatest Kids ' TV Shows . Very good for the kids !
Leaving Las Vegas	This is a really good idea for a film , sometimes disturbing , but still a triumph . Ben Sanderson ( Oscar , BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Nicolas Cage ) is a Hollywood screenwriter , really depressed because he lost his career to the one thing that he can live from , alcohol . So basically the entire film has Cage's character drinking . He one day meets a prostitute , Sera ( Hollow Man's Oscar , BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Elisabeth Shue ) who actually cares for this lover , she tells him he should stop what he is doing , but he isn't going to be stopped by anyone . The most disturbing that he does in the film is panic about having no alcohol , not just drinking it till he dies . It was nominated the Oscars for Best Director for Mike Figgis ( also nominated the Golden Globe ) and Best Writing , Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium , it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay , and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama . Nicolas Cage was number 33 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars . Very good !
Some Mothers Do ' Ave ' Em	I haven't seen that many episodes of this sitcom , but the episodes I have seen are just pure brilliant comedy . Twice BAFTA nominated Michael Crawford is just excellent as the wining main guy , Frank Spencer . I don't know exactly what he does , I think he's a builder or something . The best episode I have seen that I remember is when Frank is trying to deliver a chair and he somehow manages to stick himself to the leg with super glue , and then two people join him . The hospital scene was just wonderful and the ending was good too , a small shed falling onto Frank and him in hospital again . I have also seen him going down the road and crashing with a pair of roller skates many times , that is just classic . It was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Situation Comedy ( three times ) . The Christmas Specials were number 65 on The 100 Greatest Christmas Specials , the programme was number 22 on Britain's Best Sitcom and Frank Spencer was number 30 on The World's Greatest Comedy Characters , and he was number 22 on The 100 Greatest TV Characters . Very good !
Block-Heads	Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history , and deservedly so , so I am happy to see any of their films . It starts in the trenches of World War II , and Stan is the soldier left alone to guard , and two decades later ( 1938 ) , he is still there pacing and eating beans , with no idea the war was over . Fellow soldier Ollie meanwhile is married to his wife ( Minna Gombell ) , and remembers it is their first anniversary , so she plans a meal for the two of them . Ollie does see Stan in the paper , and goes to see him , and looking like his leg is missing , when he's actually sitting on it , he takes pity and takes him home , he does eventually see the leg before they leave . It does take a little while to get upstairs , as they miss the elevator ( once out of order ) , as Ollie gets into a small fight with James Finlayson , and kicks a ball downstairs , but they get in eventually . His wife storms out seeing Stan , and they manage to explode the kitchen with a lit match and gas , with neighbour Mrs . ' Toots ' Gilbert ( Patricia Ellis ) offering to help clean up . Mrs . Hardy returns to the mess , very angry , and Mrs . Gilbert is under a sheet shaped like a chair , before getting a trunk after Mrs . Hardy has left , and Mr . Gilbert ( Billy Gilbert ) comes in , and seeing his wife in the trunk , wearing pyjamas as well , it ends with them being chased by him and his hunting gun . Filled with wonderful slapstick and all classic comedy you could want from a black and white film , it is an enjoyable film . It was nominated the Oscar for Best Music for Marvin Hatley . Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were number 7 on The Comedians ' Comedian . Very good !
Collateral	I heard quite a lot about this film when it was at the cinemas , and it being directed by Michael Mann ( The Last of the Mohicans , Heat ) intrigued me . Basically cab driver Max ( Oscar , BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Jamie Foxx , the same year he won the Oscar for Ray ) has lived a mundane life for 12 years in Los Angeles . He gets to know a fare really well , Annie ( Jada Pinkett Smith ) who gives him her card to contact , and soon after he gets another fare who is connected ( well , he doesn't know that ) . Vincent ( a great grey-haired and bearded Tom Cruise ) is a contact-killer , and is on a mission to kill all involved with a federal grand jury , including key witnesses . He kills all these people in brutal ways , and Max is trying everything to get away or stop him , but not interfere himself . Vincent even forces him to be him to get his information about all his targets when his computer's destroyed . Of course , it is when Max finds out Annie is taking the case , and that she is his last victim that he plucks up the courage to stop Vincent . Also starring Windtalkers ' Mark Ruffalo as Fanning , Peter Berg as Richard Weidner , Bruce McGill as Pedrosa , Irma P . Hall as Ida and Patch Adams ' Barry Shabaka Henley as Daniel . Filled with fantastic camera-work , editing , and a great car crash sequence , this film is one to watch ! It was nominated the Oscar for Best Editing , and it won the BAFTA for Best Cinematography , and it was nominated for Best Editing , Best Original Screenplay , Best Sound and the David Lean Award for Direction . Tom Cruise was number 81 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons , and he was number 32 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars . Very good !
The Adventures of Tintin	A bit of a boring young man , but quite a good cartoon based in the second world war . Tintin is a reporter looking for stories and always thinking of his friends . His friends are the very good Captain Haddock , Professor Calculus ( who just loves his umbrella ) , and twin Detectives Thompson and Thomson . Tintin has many interesting and dangerous adventures with his cute dog Snowy . These include episodes with tanks , speeding trains , boats , rock climbing and many more . But it's Captain Haddock that stole the show for me . With his good voice , sometimes selfish , helpful to Tintin , and a lot of ways to make you laugh . It was number 77 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons . Good !
Stardust	I was obviously quite keen to see this at the cinema , I missed it , but when I saw it on DVD I was pretty satisfied , a good film from writer / producer / director Matthew Vaughn ( Layer Cake ) and co-writer Jane Goldman , wife of Jonathan Ross . Basically in a countryside town there is a mysterious wall to apparently another world , and the Guard ( Charlie and the Chocolate Factory's David Kelly ) is not letting anyone pass , but Dunstan Thorn ( Nathaniel Parker ) tricked his way past him , into the magical world of Stormhold . Years later , his son Tristan ( Charlie Cox ) is doing the same to get a falling star for his love Victoria ( Sienna Miller ) . When he gets there by black candle light , he lands in the star crater , and he meets the star , Yvaine ( Claire Danes ) . The don't realise it , but others are after Yvaine also , because with her heart they obtain eternal youth and life . Evil witch Lamia ( Michelle Pfeiffer ) is one of these people , and her youth obtained from another star is wearing away as she uses more of her powers in her search for Tristan and Yvaine . The film is basically a long journey across this magical land , with Tristan and Yvaine bumping into witches , pirates , including Captain Shakespeare ( Robert De Niro ) , and much more . Narrated by Sir Ian McKellen , and also starring Ricky Gervais as Ferdy the Fence , Peter O'Toole as King , Mark Strong as Septimus , Green Wing's Mark Heap as Tertius , Rupert Everett as Secundus , David Walliams as Sextus , Green Wing's Julian Rhind-Tutt as Quartus , Smack the Pony's Sarah Alexander as Empusa , Mark Williams as Billy and Dexter Fletcher as Skinny Pirate . A very good cast , some good special effects , and the Take That single " Rule The World " is fantastic , it was tipped for an Oscar nomination for Best Song , but it never received one ( instead three for The Golden Compass , and the winner was for that Irish film Once ) . Very good !
The Wrong Man	Sir Alfred Hitchcock , Master of Suspense , was popular for taking terrible incidents in real life and turning them into what make his masterpieces ( most popular being Psycho ) , but this film is only focusing on the true story itself . Basically Christopher Emmanuel ' Manny ' Balestrero ( Henry Fonda ) is an ordinary New York musician who is wrongfully identified and arrested for the crime of hold-up robbery , as he was innocently getting money for his wife Rose ( Psycho's Vera Miles ) to have dental treatment . Manny constantly pleads his innocence , but in doing so looks even more guilty , especially host to the police and witnesses who point to him . Unfortunately , Rose breaks down into a depression and is institutionalised , while his trial isn't going well , even granted mistrial , but thankfully , awaiting re-trial , the real criminal is caught ( and there is a likeness by the way ) , and he is set free , while his wife still remains in her quiet state , don't worry , the ending text said she recovered , and they moved to Florida . Also starring Lawrence of Arabia's Anthony Quayle as Frank D . O'Connor , Harold J . Stone as Det . Lt . Bowers , Esther Minciotti as Mama Balestrero , Charles Cooper as Det . Matthews , Nehemiah Persoff as Eugene ' Gene ' Conforti , Laurinda Barrett as Constance Willis , Norma Connolly as Betty Todd , Doreen Lang as Ann James , Frances Reid as Mrs . O'Connor , Lola D'Annunzio as Manny's Sister Olga Conforti , Robert Essen as Gregory Balestrero and Kippy Campbell as Robert Balestrero . I can see why this film is a bit forgotten by Hitch fans , but with fine performances from Fonda and Miles , and a great real story from a fine director , this does deserves more popularity . Sir Alfred Hitchcock was number 75 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons . Very good !
Trading Places	From director John Landis ( The Blues Brothers , An American Werewolf in London ) , and back when a certain African American actor was being rude , there was this pretty good comedy . A successful Philadelphia commodity broker ( buying and selling physical commodities , e . g . coffee , sugar and orange juice , and dealing with their futures ) , Louis Winthorpe III ( Dan Aykroyd ) has everything he needs , a mansion , a girlfriend , and manservant Coleman ( BAFTA winning Denholm Elliott ) , and Billy Ray Valentine ( Golden Globe nominated Eddie Murphy ) is a hustling beggar with hardly any knowledge of the business world . Winthorpe's employees , the elderly Duke brothers , Randolph ( Ralph Bellamy ) and Mortimer ( Don Ameche ) have a bet that by swapping these two guys lifestyle , Billy will make good , while Louis will resort to crime to get by . Billy is bailed from jail , and almost automatically brought into this business world will all the stuff Louis had , while Louis is broke with no access to his fortune or property . The only help he gets is from prostitute Ophelia ( BAFTA winning Jamie Lee Curtis ) prepared to help him get back to his old life . Soon enough though , it is not just Louis that has issues with Billy , but Billy himself is suspicious of what the Duke brothers are up to , and why they have given this fortune to him . Louis at one point gets drunken and has a gun , but Billy discovers the Duke brothers bet , and in the end they get their own back at the commodities place lowering their intakes ( or something like that ) . Also starring Die Hard's Paul Gleason as Clarence Beeks , James Belushi as Harvey / King Kong , Alfred Drake as Whittington President of Exchange and The Muppets ' Frank Oz as Corrupt Cop . I can agree the ending is slightly " brash " , but this is still an entertaining film with great performances by Murphy , Aykroyd and Curtis ( you even get to see her breasts ) . It was nominated the Oscar for Best Music for Elmer Bernstein , it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay , and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy / Musical . Eddie Murphy was number 67 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars , Jamie Lee Curtis was number 52 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols , and the film was number 35 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films . Very good !
It's Not Fair	This was a sequence of the Saturday morning kids show Scratchy & Co . This was just pure brilliance in amusement . Basically a kid brings in an adult he or she hates for something . The host asks this person a couple of questions . If the adult gets most of them wrong he / she must be punished by either going under the burger or the hot dog , the kid would choose this . Obviously this burger or hot dog was filled with Gunge , and the kid can obviously control when it is put over the adult . So basically , It's Not Fair for the adults or when the kid cannot win a prize or get the adult Gunged . Very good when I was younger , the family would love it !
The Madness of King George	Based on the play , this is quite a good period drama of a new king of England that has an almost unexplainable madness . I did fall asleep somewhere , probably when Sir Ian Holm was helping cure the king , but what I did see of this film , based in the time of The French Revolution was good . Basically George III ( BAFTA winning , and Oscar nominated Nigel Hawthorne ) has recently been crowned , and not long after starts a dementia , and becomes more alive and more politically marginalized . All are concerned , especially wife Queen Charlotte ( Oscar and BAFTA nominated Dame Helen Mirren ) , well , unless you count the stupid Prince of Wales ( Rupert Everett ) . The only person who may be able to help the king return to normal " what-what " is Dr . Willis ( BAFTA nominated Holm ) . Also starring Rupert Graves as Greville , Amanda Donohoe as Lady Pembroke , Green Wing's Julian Rhind-Tutt as Duke of York , Julian Wadham as Pitt , Jim Carter as Fox and Geoffrey Palmer as Warren . I can see why Blackadder picked on this period with Prince George in Blackadder the Third . It won the Oscar for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration , and it was nominated for Best Writing , Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium , and it won the BAFTAs for Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film and Best Makeup / Hair , and it was nominated for Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for George Fenton , Best Cinematography , Best Costume Design , Best Editing , Best Production Design , Best Adapted Screenplay , Best Sound , David Lean Award for Direction for Nicholas Hytner and Best Film . Rupert Everett was number 39 on The 50 Greatest British Actors , Amanda Donohoe was number 38 , and Dame Helen Mirren number 7 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses , and Mirren was number 5 on Britain's Finest Actresses . Very good !
Happiness	From director / writer Todd Solondz this is a well acted and well scripted controversial black comedy . It focuses on the lives of a group of men and women who engage in shocking antisocial behaviour , the title by the way is a joke ( but there's also a song called " Happiness " , and the last scene there's a toast to happiness ) . The shocking behaviour includes obscene phone calls by Allen ( Capote's Philip Seymour Hoffman ) , murder and paedophilia by Bill Maplewood ( Dylan Baker ) , there are also basic tragic events such as break ups , Bill's son Timmy ( Justin Elvin ) who wants to be a grown up ( by producing cum ) and questionable love stories . This tragicomedy may have lack of moral judgement , and you ( the audience ) may be the ones to make your own minds up about the events , but there are still plenty of giggles in the sick circumstances , and you can feel pity and get drawn in to most of the people's lives . Also starring Jane Adams as Joy Jordan , Jon Lovitz as Andy Kornbluth , Men in Black 2's Lara Flynn Boyle as Helen Jordan , Louise Lasser as Mona Jordan , Ben Gazzara as Lenny Jordan , Jared Harris as Vlad , Marla Maples as Ann Chambeau , Elizabeth Ashley as Diane Freed and Molly Shannon as Nancy . For me the most engaging stories were : lonely Allen calling Joy and masturbating , and then calling her sister Helen and really letting out his sexual desires , and when they actually meet , they don't do it ; and paedophile Bill , who is both comforting his questioning and worrying son , and he has feelings for his young best friend , and there is that gripping scene where he admits to his son Timmy that he fed him ! Certainly not a film to miss . It won a prize at the Cannes Film Festival , and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay . Very good !
101 Things Removed from the Human Body	This isn't one of those 100 greatest lists that Channel 4 does quite a lot of , this is one of those special one offs about horrible , disgusting , weird and unusual things that have been removed from the human body . It doesn't matter if you have an accident , you eat / take in things or are pregnant , there was always someone on this programme who went to the operating table to have something taken out . Remarkably , all people on the show that were mentioned survived ! I can't completely believe that all of them lived . Anyway , it was an interesting show with some sorry to say amusing moments , ridiculous things gone into the body , and obviously some gore . Examples of things removed : knife , glass , anchor , hammer , mallet , screwdriver , fence post , nails , Forgotten baby , sword , keys , javelin , diamonds , necklace , dog hairs , refrigerator , pole , pipe , stapler , mug , pitch fork , conducting stick , and a Man's twin brother ( in his stomach ) . It was followed by 101 Things You Can Do With a Dead Body . Very good !
Little Shop of Horrors	Based on the 1960 film , apparently only filmed in two or three days , this is the remake based on the Howard Ashman Broadway musical , directed by Muppet veteran Frank Oz ( In & Out , Bowfinger ) . Basically nerdy Seymour Krelborn ( Rick Moranis ) wants to help improve business at the florist he works at for Mr . Mushnik ( Vincent Gardenia ) , and get the interest of his co-worker who he has a crush on , Audrey ( Ellen Greene , reprising her Marilyn Monroe inspired Broadway role ) , by placing an unusual and unidentified plant in the window to attract customers , and it works . The plant , Audrey II , seems to have a craving on blood , and grows after every feeding , to the point when it speaks / sings for itself ( with the voice of The Four Tops ' Levi Stubbs ) for his supper . Luckily Seymour finds the perfect victim he can chop up and feed to Audrey II , sadistic dentist and Audrey's on-off boyfriend Orin Scrivello ( Steve Martin ) , Mr . Mushnik is also victim to the plant after witnessing Seymour's chopping up . Seymour questions Audrey on why she loves him , and it's not for the success of the plant , and not long after she discovers the truth , nearly to her demise , Seymour decides it's finally time to put a stop to Audrey II . Also starring Tichina Arnold as Crystal , Tisha Campbell-Martin as Chiffon , Michelle Weeks as Ronette , James Belushi as Patrick Martin , John Candy as Wink Wilkinson , Bill Murray as Arthur Denton and Christopher Guest as Customer # 1 , Miriam Margolyes as Dental Nurse and Stan Jones as Narrator . The Doo-Wop songs ( of course all performed by the actors themselves ) are all very catchy , in particular : " Grow For Me " , " Somewhere That's Green " ( spoofed hilariously in Family Guy ) , " Dentist ! " , " Feed Me ( Git It ) " and the Oscar nominated " Mean Green Mother from Outer Space " . With a similar feel to The Rocky Horror Picture Show , this is a fantastic special effects and star-filled black comedy horror musical . It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects , it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Effects , and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy / Musical and Best Original Score for Miles Goodman . It was number 21 on The 100 Greatest Musicals . Very good !
The World's Fastest Indian	These are the kind of films I like , an eccentric lead character to take you through an uplifting and feel-good journey , and it is based on a true story , from director Roger Donaldson ( Species , Dante's Peak ) . Basically ageing New Zealander Burt Munro ( Sir Anthony Hopkins ) has been dreaming for 25 about taking the motorcycle , called an " Indian " to the salt flats of Bonneville , Utah and break the high speed record . So , when heart disease threatens his life , he mortgages his house and travels to Los Angeles , buys an old car , gets the Indian through customs , and begins his road trip . Along the way , he charms many people with his open and direct friendliness , and some of these people seem just as unusual as him . They include car salesman Fernando ( Rat Race's Paul Rodriguez ) , transvestite Tina ( Chris Williams ) who helps run a brothel , a Native American , Ada ( Diane Ladd ) who helps him repair the trailer and become his lover , and young Air Force pilot Rusty ( Patrick Flueger ) from Vietnam . Burt finally reaches Utah , greeted by racer Jim Moffet ( Christopher Lawford ) , who helps him get his right to race , because he didn't sign up three months ago , he doesn't have all safety precautions ( no makeshift tyres , no chute , no brakes ) , he is old , and he finds heat and wobbling a problem when reaching the high speeds . The film ends thankfully with the Indian Burt has worked so hard on for years breaking the fastest speed record , and he continues to do so till his death , breaking many more records . Also starring Aaron Murphy as Tom , Annie Whittle as Fran , Joe Howard as Otto , Greg Johnson as Duncan and Tessa Mitchell as Sarah . Hopkins is wonderful , he hasn't been this good ( in my opinion ) since The Silence of the Lambs , he is just the lovable eccentric who makes everyone feel good , the audience included , a great adventure film . Very good !
No Country for Old Men	From Oscar , BAFTA and Golden Globe winning ( and nominated ) writer / director brothers Joel and Ethan Coen ( Fargo , Raising Arizona ) this is certainly a thriller worth watching . Basically in the 1980's , West Texas , Llewelyn Moss ( Planet Terror's Josh Brolin ) finds the remains of a drug deal gone violently wrong , as well as a suitcase with $2 million , so obviously he's not telling the cops . Doing this , he now has psychopathic killer Anton Chigurh ( Oscar , BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Javier Bardem ) , who will kill almost anyone that gets in his way , and despairing , quite quiet Sheriff Ed Tom Bell ( BAFTA nominated Tommy Lee Jones ) , are both on his tail . There are many intense and gripping scenes as Chigurh gets closer to finding Moss , and there is a lot of blood spill , but the heart of Bell obviously keeps the intensity from becoming too hard to handle . Also starring Woody Harrelson as Carson Wells , Trainspotting's BAFTA nominated Kelly Macdonald as Carla Jean Moss , Garret Dillahunt as Deputy Wendell , Tess Harper as Loretta Bell and Barry Corbin as Ellis . Bardem is superb as the really chilling killer , the ending where Brolin dies , and Bardem gets away , oh , and Jones is talking about some dream he had , is the tiniest bit disappointing . But that doesn't stop this film from being a great thriller from the Coen brothers . It won the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year and Best Writing , Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published for the Coen brothers , and it was nominated for Best Cinematography , Best Editing , Best Sound and Best Sound Editing , it won the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography , and it was nominated for Best Film , Best Editing , Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Sound , and it won the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay , and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Drama . Very good !
The Muppet Christmas Carol	This is the Charles Dickens classic Christmas story ( no major changes , apart from two Marleys ) made into a film , filled with Muppets . This followed the death of Jim Henson in 1990 , and also Richard Hunt in 1992 , Jim's son Brian is debut director of this film . Sir Michael Caine is fantastic as Scrooge , probably the best one I've ever seen . The Great Gonzo ( Dave Goelz ) playing Charles Dicken and Rizzo the Rat ( Steve Whitmire ) playing himself follow Scrooge around as the story is told . It also appears Kermit the Frog ( Whitmire ) as Bob Cratchit , his nephew Robin ( Jerry Nelson ) as the loving Tiny Tim , Fozzie Bear ( Frank Oz ) as Fozziwig , and of course , Miss Piggy ( Oz ) as Mrs . Cratchit . I think Caine's best moments are those of sadness and happiness , although he is good grumpy too . He is also very good at singing towards the end when Scrooge has realised the spirit of Christmas . The Muppets were number 47 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons . Very good !
Star Stories	This is a really good satire comedy about the lives of well known celebrities / stars in the world . All the stories are true , but made like an episode of The League of Gentlemen , i . e . dark . Every episode they take famous celebrities known to us in Britain , whether single people or couples , and it gives us a new twist of all news we heard about them . The people they have mocked and made into genius Little Britain type characters so far are David and Victoria Beckham ( with The Spice Girls and Alex Ferguson ) , George Michael ( along with Sir Bob Geldof , Sir Elton John and Boy George ) , Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas ( with Mick Hucknall and Kirk Douglas ) , Madonna and Guy Ritchie ( with Vinnie Jones ) , Sadie Frost and Jude Law ( with Steven Spielberg and Sean Pertwee ) and Jennifer Aniston , Brad Pitt & Angelina Jolie ( with the Friends cast ) . The only member of the cast I can remember is Rhys Thomas from The Fast Show . Very good !
Addams Family Values	This is the sequel to the film based on the comedy horror TV series . Golden Globe nominated Anjelica Huston returns Morticia Addams and Raul Julia as Gomez Addams . They now have Uncle Fester ( brilliantly cast Christopher Lloyd ) living with them . But it isn't long before Fester meets a beautiful woman that he wants to be with . I can't remember all of it but the film is mainly focused on Fester living with this awful woman . I think they get married and she keeps trying to kill him , but that's the comedy of it , he always survives . Also starring young Christina Ricci as Wednesday Addams , Jimmy Workman as Pugsley Addams , Peter MacNicol as Gary Granger , Nathan Lane as a Desk Sergeant and even the director , Barry Sonnenfeld appears as Mr . Glicker . A very good comedy horror from the director of The Mummy . Christopher Lloyd is the highlight of the whole film . It was nominated the Oscar for Best Art Direction - Set Decoration , and it was nominated the BAFTA fro Best Make Up Artist . Very good !
Comic Relief Does Fame Acadmey	I have never watched the normal show , all I know about it is that it made Lemar into a singing star . This celebrity edition for the charity Comic Relief is a really funny experience that Patrick Kielty and Cat Deeley bring us . Basically over the weeks celebrity contestants battle it out to impress the judges Richard Park , Carrie Grant and David Grant and the public until there is a clear winner . There have been two series of the celebrity version so far . In those two series have been : Edith Bowman , Jo Brand ; , Fearne Cotton , Jon Culshaw , Adrian Edmondson , Ulrika Jonsson , Doon Mackichan , EastEnders Sam Mitchel , Kim Medcalf , Al Murray , Paul Ross , Debra Stephenson , John Thomson , Gina Yashere and of course , number 57 on The 100 Greatest Funny Moments ( for her performances ) , Ruby Wax . Very good !
Carry On Screaming	If you like the British Hammer Horror series , and you like the innuendo filled humour of the British Carry On series , then maybe you'll like the mix of the two together . Basically Albert Potter ( Jim Dale ) has his girlfriend Doris Mann ( Angela Douglas ) taken away when they are in the woods , and Det . Sgt . Sidney Bung ( Steptoe and Son's Harry H . Corbett ) with Det . Const . Slobotham ( Peter Butterworth ) investigate , as this is not the first time it has happened . Near the woods is a large house , and they are suspicious of the master , Dr . Orlando Watt ( Kenneth Williams ) , who has been dead for many years , and is only brought back by a charge of electricity by his seductive sister , Valeria ( Fenella Fielding ) . Bung and Slobotham get a lead from the large house's ex-gardener Dan Dann ( Charles Hawtrey ) , who just before giving them vital information is killed , as well as Dr . Fettle ( Jon Pertwee ) , who was investigating the finger found in the woods , he was killed by the creature created from electric charge ( from the finger ) . Bung goes back to the large house for more answers from Valeria , but he instead is seduced by her , and he has no leads the the many womens ' disappearances . Dr . Watt wants these women to create wax statues to sell to shops and businesses that require figures , and unfortunately , Potter recognises his girlfriend when she is put in a shop . All characters are brought back to the large house , and the two creatures ( werewolves ) won't stop till all interferences are stopped , and all good guys won't stop till the terrors are put to an end . Also starring Joan Sims as Emily Bung , Bernard Bresslaw as Sockett , Tom Clegg as Oddbod and Billy Cornelius as Oddbod Junior , but where are Sid James and Barbara Windsor when you want them ? It is obviously more funny than scary , but the reference to Mystery of the Wax Museum is obvious , and it certainly a good spoof of the old horror film genre . Carry On films were number 39 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons , and this film was number 30 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments ( why ? ) . Very good !
Diary of the Dead	The first three originals are fantastic , bigger budget Land of the Dead kind of fell short , but this fifth entry from director George A . Romero is a much better return to basics in his series . With a big nod to The Blair Witch Project , this satire examines the power of media , where a bunch of teenagers are on the run from the walking dead and filming many of their experiences to make a film ( within the film ) fittingly titled " The Death of Death " . Like Dawn of the Dead seeing a possible attack on consumerism , this has a similar feel , anyone with a camcorder , writing a blog or texting their experiences is " infected " , telling their version of the " truth " . Of course , you can ignore this idea and concentrate on the action itself , there is plenty of innovative splatter and visceral excitement to keep fans happy , all captured in documentary style filming . Starring Joshua Close as Jason Creed , Philip Riccio as Ridley Wilmott , Michelle Morgan as Debra Moynihan , Shawn Roberts as Tony Ravello , Amy Ciupak Lalonde as Tracy Thurman , Joe Dinicol as Eliot Stone , Scott Wentworth as Andrew Maxwell , Chris Violette as Gordo Thorsen , Tatiana Maslany as Mary Dexter , a cameo by Romero as Police Chief Arthur Katzand the voices of Wes Craven , Stephen King , Simon Pegg , Quentin Tarantino and Guillermo del Toro , all as Newsreaders . In comparison to the original trilogy , this is a perfect addition to the series , much better than the previous instalment , I would love to see another as good as this one . Very good !
The World's . . . and Me	Mark Dolan is a great comedic host for Balls of Steel , and when it first started , I was intrigued to see him tackling this documentary series . Some may argue that he is similar to Louis Theroux , but I can't see much similarity , and technically , Dolan is more friendly and likes to really get to know the people he meets . Anyway , basically Dolan travels the world to find people with extraordinary talents , bodily oddities and unusual lifestyles , and even some records . People have included World's Tallest Women , World's Smallest Men , World's Fattest Pets , World's Hairiest People , World's Cleveriest Children , World's Most Enhanced Women ( with Minka and Kayla Kleevage appearing ) , World's Largest Families and World's Strongest Children . I always look forward to seeing these programmes . Very good !
The China Syndrome	The title sounded familiar , and the three lead stars were very appealing , and the critics give it a good rating , so I had to at least try it , and I'm glad I did . Basically TV reporter Kimberly Wells ( BAFTA winning , and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Jane Fonda ) , aspiring to do the hard hitting stories , and radical cameraman Richard Adams ( Michael Douglas , also producing ) are at Ventana nuclear power plant outside LA doing a light report about energy production . While viewing the control room from the observation room , they witness shift supervisor Jack Godell ( BAFTA winning , and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Jack Lemmon ) stopping an accident , and it was captured secretly on film . Kimberley and Richard are now trying to get the facts as to the incident that happened at the plant , hoping to make it as a real story to be broadcast on the news , but they have no permission to air unauthorised footage . Meanwhile , Godell is still concerned about the safety of the plant , and trying to keep a straight face in front of Kimberley . But it is obvious his worry is increasing , and he tells Kimberley the truth , and it is obvious people at the plant will do anything to make sure the truth doesn't get out , even if it means killing whoever could reveal it , including Godell . It all comes to head with Godell armed in the control room demanding an interview with Kimbeley , Richard filming , to tell the country the truth of the near accident , and even with him being shot , it is good to know that the conspiracy and another near accident is stopped . Also starring Scott Brady as Herman De Young , James Hampton as Bill Gibson , Peter Donat as Don Jacovich , Cocoon's Wilford Brimley as Ted Spindler , Richard Herd as Evan Mc Cormack , Daniel Valdez as Hector Salas and Stan Bohrman as Peter Martin . With fantastic performances by Fonda and Lemmon , Douglas made a good decision putting no music score in , it is a most gripping and thrilling " what if " political drama . It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Writing , Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen , it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Film and Best Screenplay , and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama , Best Director for James Bridges and Best Screenplay . It was number 94 on 100 Years , 100 Thrills . Very good !
Chinatown	From BAFTA and Golden Globe winning , and Oscar nominated director Roman Polanski this is a classic thriller . Basically JJ ' Jake ' Gittes ( BAFTA and Golden Globe winning , and Oscar nominated Jack Nicholson , in what many consider his " best-ever role " , I personally love him in Cuckoo's Nest ) is the private detective , who makes an honest living sticking his nose into others lives , specialising in matrimonial cases . He is hired by Evelyn Mulwray ( Bonnie and Clyde's Oscar , BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Faye Dunaway ) when she suspects her husband Hollis ( Darrell Zwerling ) , who built the city water supply system , of having an affair . He professionally photographs him with a young girl , but he does not realise in this scandal is that Mrs . Mulwray is an impersonator . When Hollis is found dead ( drowned with salt water in his lungs ) , Jake is now in the middle of a case of deceit , murder , incest and municipal corruption , all relating back to the city's water supply . The memorable moments for me are Jake having his nose cut , finding out that Evelyn has a sister / daughter , because her villain father , Noah Cross ( BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated John Huston ) raped her , and the conclusion where Evelyn is driving away and shot in the eye . Also starring Perry Lopez as Lieutenant Lou Escobar , John Hillerman as Russ Yelburton Diane Ladd as Ida Sessions , Roy Jenson as Claude Mulvihill , Polanski as Man with Knife , Richard Bakalyan as Detective Loach , Joe Mantell as Lawrence Walsh , Diamonds Are Forever's Bruce Glover as Duffy , James Hong as Kahn and Burt Young as Curly . It won the Oscar for Best Writing , Original Screenplay , and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration , Best Cinematography , Best Costume Design , Best Film Editing , Best Music for Jerry Goldsmith , Best Sound and Best Picture , it won the BAFTA for Best Screenplay , and it was nominated for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music , Best Art Direction , Best Cinematography , Best Costume Design , Best Film Editing and Best Film , and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay - Motion Picture , and it was nominated for Best Original Score . Jack Nicholson was number 6 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars , he was number 71 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons , he was number 63 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols , and he was number 7 on The World's Greatest Actor , Noah Cross was number 16 on 100 Years , 100 Heroes & Villains , the film was number 9 on 100 Years of Film Scores , it was number 74 on 100 Years , 100 Quotes ( " Forget it , Jake , it's Chinatown . " ) , it was number 16 on 100 Years , 100 Thrills , it was number 4 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You Die , it was number 19 on 100 Years , 100 Movies , and it was number 48 on The 100 Greatest Films . Very good !
Ed , Edd , ' n ' Eddy	This is repeated a lot on Cartoon Network , but whop cares it brilliantly hilarious . It's a cartoon that you can get used to seeing again and again . It's the crazy idea of three idiotic friends with the same name . Ed is the stupidest one , Edd " Double D " is the one who has some knowledge , but is still an idiot , and Eddy is the scamming one who always wants money to buy beloved Jawbreakers . There are also many other characters who are either the ones being scammed , or are helping them with whatever . There's also Jimmy with the huge brace around his face , Sarah who is Ed's bossy sister , Kevin who always laughs and pesters the boys , Rolf who is always trying to be neat and do his chores , Nazz who hardly does anything , and of course Jonny with his best friend Plank , a a plank of wood . The only characters who I'm not fond of that always ruin the Eds plans are the Kanker sisters , always stealing their money and kissing them . But apart from that , a really good cartoon . Very good !
Train Pulling Into a Station	It was number 100 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments because it was one of the very first moving picture films to be shown in cinemas . From the Lumiére Bros . , who brought us other one minute films of basically normal events , this is quite an interesting short film where nothing much really happens . I can understand that it shocked people back then and made them scream and run out of the cinema , but you can't help but find it quite amusing . I mean , think about it , the train is not directly in the middle of the screen , the picture is jumping and fuzzy , and it is black and white . But still , you have to marvel that it had that effect . Very good !
Hannah and Her Sisters	From BAFTA nominated actor / Oscar winning , and BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated writer / BAFTA winning , and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated director Woody Allen ( Annie Hall ) , this is a terrific comedy drama . Basically during a Thanksgiving dinner party we make acquaintance with the leading characters , the three sisters : straight-laced Hannah ( Rosemary's Baby's BAFTA nominated Mia Farrow ) , unfaithful Lee ( Beaches ' BAFTA nominated Barbara Hershey ) and kooky Holly ( Edward Scissorhands ' Oscar winning , and Golden Globe nominated Dianne Wiest ) . Then after this the story breaks up to follow each individual in stories of affairs , break-ups , awkward dates and much more . Allen is funny as the neurotic and hypochondriac TV producer Mickey Sachs , and he does a good job directing . But one of the main reasons I wanted to see the film was for the performance by Oscar winning , and BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Sir Michael Caine , as Elliot , he plays a terrific bumbling man in love with Hannah's sister , Lee . Wiest is also very good as the sister with quite a few problems getting to places she wants to .

Comic Relief Presents Have I Got Buzzcocks All Over	This show was part of the long line up of entertainment on Comic Relief 2001 , I didn't actually see the show but I saw this on the Highlights show . This was basically taking three comedy tabloid like shows and bringing them together . These shows are Have I Got News For You , Never Mind the Buzzcock's and They Think It's All Over . Angus Deayton hosted this really good show . Taking part in answering the many rounds ( shown in highlights ) ( that I know ) were Stephen Fry and Never Mind the Buzzcocks ' Phil Jupitus . There were rounds like : odd one out , four with something in common ( but one ) , a clip of The World Bowls Championship and feel the person challenge . This was just a very good highlight of Comic Relief 2001 . Very good !
Men Behaving Badly	I had seen many bits and pieces , mainly various outtakes on Blunder shows , and one full episode ( the final one , " Delivery " ) , and when I finally decided to get the whole lot , I was very pleased . The series started with BAFTA winning ( and nominated ) , British Comedy Award winning , and National Television Award nominated Martin Clunes as Gary Strang , Leslie Ash as Deborah and British Comedy Award winning ( and nominated ) Caroline Quentin as Dorothy , but originally Harry Enfield was the fourth member of the gang , as Dermot , but he apparently wasn't comfortable , and replacement Neil Morrissey as Tony Smart made the show what we know today . The series basically revolved around best mates Gary and Tony ( and for that first series , Dermot , but forget about him now ) who share a two bedroom home . They are two grown up men who act like kids , and spend most time either drinking in their local , at home having all male conversations ( while drinking ) , or lingering after their love interests , Gary with Dorothy , and Tony with Deborah . Also starring Ian Lindsay as George , Valerie Minifie as Anthea , Dave Atkins as Les and John Thomson as Ken , with appearances by young Catherine Tate as Young Woman , EastEnders ' Tamzin Outhwaite as Girl in Pub , Sugar Rush's Sara Stewart as Judy , EastEnders ' Amanda Drew as Wendy and EastEnders ' Lucy Speed as Chambermaid . The dialogue was good , the slapstick was good , the stories were good , and of course , Clunes and Morrissey are perfect , a good series that will never get boring , no matter how many times you've seen it . It was twice nominated the BAFTA for Best Comedy ( Programme or Series ) , it won ( and was nominated for ) the British Comedy Award for Best BBC / ITV Sitcom / Comedy , and it twice won the National Television Award Most Popular Comedy Series , and it was nominated for Most Popular Comedy Programme . Martin Clunes was number 35 on TV's 50 Greatest Stars , the episode " Performance " was number 37 on The 100 Greatest Christmas Moments , and the programme was number 16 on Britain's Best Sitcom . Very good !
James Bond's Greatest Hits	As part of the celebration of the release of the new Bond , Casino Royale starring Daniel Craig , this countdown was counting down the best Bond soundtracks and themes .

Very good !
Live and Let Die	With Sir Sean Connery out of the picture ( unless you count Never Say Never Again ) and George Lazenby forgotten , we needed a new Bond to fill the famous shoes . They chose a very good Sir Roger Moore . He's the one with just as much charm and humour as the original guy . This time he is in the Caribbean facing the only black villain of the collection , Kananga ( Yaphet Kotto ) . Also he is introduced to the beautiful and mysterious card reader , Solitaire ( Jane Seymour ) . This is a very good start for the new Bond , filled with marvellous scenery and very good action sequences , including a fight with the villain Tee Hee and his metal arm . Also including a good chase sequence involving boats . Also starring Bernard Lee as M and Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny , but no Q ! James Bond was number 3 on 100 Years , 100 Heroes & Villains , he was number 21 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols , and he was number 21 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons , the film was number 3 on James Bond's Greatest Hits for Paul McCartney and Wings ' Oscar nominated title song , and it was number 69 on The Ultimate Film . Very good !
Goodnight Mister Tom	This made-for-TV film is a brilliant one . This is probably the best and favourite role by BAFTA winning John Thaw ( Kavanagh Q . C . and Inspector Morse ) . Tom Oakley ( Thaw ) widowed man has lived in a village alone for a while since his wife and son died , and now he has been landed with an evacuee called Willaim Beech ( Nick Robinson ) . As he gets to know this child he starts to develop a friendship . Until Willaim's Mum ( Annabelle Apsion ) wants him back . After Tom gets worried about William not contacting him he goes to London to find him . In the end Willaim gets his home with a loving family ( or Dad ) . Set during the Second World War this is an excellent film . It was nominated the BAFTA Lew Grade Award , and it won the National Television Award for Most Popular Drama . John Thaw was number 3 on TV's 50 Greatest Stars . Very good !
Jimmy Carr Live	I first saw him on Distraction , then on a couple of 100 Greatest programmes , and before this was released there was The Friday Night Project . Now he is one of my most favourite comedians , I even saw him live on stage myself for his second live tour . Anyway , this is the first tour from Jimmr Carr , and this live recorded show is one of the most simple and yet hilarious things ever made . Obviously people may be offended by his use of swearing , especially the " c word " , but he is still bloody funny . He does jokes about his girlfriend , newspaper ads , his personal life , being famous and many other things that we probably didn't know could be that funny . Jimmy Carr was number 12 on 100 Greatest Stand-Ups . Very good !
Comic Relief : The Apprentice	I had never watched the real series before , but I had seen bits of it on Harry Hill's TV Burp . So this was the first of it I saw , before a real series started under two months later . Basically a bunch of celebrities were bunched up , Boys vs . Girls , and the task given to them by Amstrad founder Sir Alan Sugar , in aid of Comic Relief 2007 , was to buy many ride , food , drink and invite many wealthy celebrities to a high priced charity funfair to raise as much money as possible , not only for charity , but as part of their teams . The boys included Danny Baker , Alastair Campbell , Rupert Everett , Ross Kemp , Piers Morgan and Sir Alan's last Apprentice ( replacing Everett ) , Tim Campbell . The girls included Karren Brady , Jo Brand , Maureen Lipman , Cheryl Tweedy / Cole and Trinny Woodall . The celebrities that attended the funfair and paid high prices for both sides included Noddy Holder , Simon Cowell , Geri Halliwell , Peter Stringfellow , Michael Winner and Anthony Worral Thompson . When the task was over , the team that raised the least amount of money would have a person be fired , the boys lost , and the deserved person that was fired , for being a total stuck up bastard was Piers Morgan ( who not long before this programme was fired from his newspaper ) . Narrated by Mark Halliley . Very good !
Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone	The first of the popular books by J . K . Rowling was one of the most anticipated films at the time , and it became one of the most successful family films in cinema , from director Chris Columbus ( Home Alone , Mrs . Doubtfire ) . Harry Potter ( Daniel Radcliffe ) has lived with his Uncle Vernon ( Richard Griffiths ) and Aunt Petunia ( Fiona Shaw ) and their son since he was a baby . Then one day , after attacks by letters for him , Rubeus Hagrid ( BAFTA nominated Robbie Coltrane ) takes Harry to be taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry . He takes money from the Wizard Bank and buys a wand from Mr . Ollivander ( John Hurt ) on the way , and he also finds out he is famous for surviving an attack by He Who Must Not Be Named , explaining the scar on his forehead . When Harry is on his way to Hogwarts at London Liverpool Station he needs to find Platform 9 and 3 quarters , and asking Mrs . Molly Weasley ( Julie Walters ) he goes through a wall between platforms 9 and 10 . On the train he meets Ron Weasley ( Rupert Grint ) , and briefly Hermoine Granger ( Emma Watson ) . Then at the school , they meet Professor Minerva McGonagall ( Dame Maggie Smith ) , the mean Slytherin bound Draco Malfoy ( Tom Felton ) , before going in front of Professor Albus Dumbledore ( Richard Harris ) and the other teachers to be put into the appropriate houses by the wizard hat . The film continues to see their lessons with teachers , including Professor Severus Snape ( Alan Rickman ) teaching potions , Madame Hooch ( Zoë Wanamaker ) teaching broom flying , and Professor Flitwick ( Leprechaun's Warwick Davis , also playing Goblin Bank Teller ) teaching levitation . Then is the first and ( then ) gripping Quidditch game , Gryffindor vs . Slytherin with Harry as the seeker trying to catch the Golden Snitch to win the game , while everyone scores with the Quaffel . But as time goes by , Harry , Ron and Hermoine discover a plan to steal something guarded by the giant two-headed dog ( Fluffy ) , that they later find out is called the Philosopher's Stone ( the Americans insist on calling the boring Sorcerer's Stone ) . Harry and the other two eventually pluck up the courage to get past the dog , and traps , including Devil's Snare plants , flying keys ( to the door ) and the giant game of Wizard's Chess . Harry eventually faces his great foe , and he suspected the very mysterious Snape , but it was in fact Professor Quirinus Quirrell ( Ian Hart ) , but the real villain is on the back of his head , Harry's parents killer Vodermort , aka He Who ( well , you know the rest ) . Harry survives and kills Voldermort and Quirrel , is reunited with his friends , Gryffindor deservedly wins the house cup , and Harry goes home with great memories . Also starring John Cleese as Nearly Headless Nick and David Bradley as Argus Filch . It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration , Best Costume Design and Best Music for John Williams , and it was nominated the BAFTAs for the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film , Best Feature Film ( Children's Award ) , Best Special Visual Effects , Best Costume Design , Best Make Up / Hair , Best Production Design and Best Sound . Harry Potter was number 45 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons , but he was also number 35 on The 100 Worst Britons ( the only fictional person , why ? ) , the film was number 11 on The Ultimate Film , and it was number 15 on The 100 Greatest Family Films . Very good !
A Star Is Born	I didn't actually finish the entire film , the ending would have been pretty awkward with a suicide anyway . But what I did watch of the film was a real feast for the eyes , and the ears , a remake from director George Cukor ( The Philadelphia Story , My Fair Lady ) . Golden Globe winning , and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Judy Garland ( 15 years since The Wizard of Oz ) as Esther Blodgett / Vicki Lester is very believable character . Her singing is essential listening and viewing for the audience , and she can be a very good physical character . Golden Globe winning , and Oscar nominated James Mason also stars as Norman Maine , the man who first discovered Esther's singing talent and made her a star . His character even helped her to win an Oscar somehow , she wasn't even nominated . So a very good musical with marvellous singing and dancing . It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration , Best Costume Design , Best Music for Ray Heindorf and Best Song for " The Man that Got Away " which was number 11 on 100 Years , 100 Songs . Judy Garland was number 82 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars , she was number 85 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons , she was number 8 on 100 Years , 100 Stars - Women , and she was number 28 on The World's Greatest Actor , the film was number 7 on 100 Years of Musicals , it was number 31 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers , it was 43 on 100 Years , 100 Passions , and it was number 45 on The 100 Greatest Musicals . Very good !
The Best of the Worst	Hosted by the great Alexander Armstrong with team captains David Mitchell and Johnny Vaughn , this is great comedy celebrating the very best of the very bad . They basically go through four rounds : The Worst of Four things , e . g . cosmetic surgery , Top 5 Worst something , e . g . World Record , Which Ends the Worst ( choose one of two clips ) and One Off Worst Things to guess . This is a really good twist on the Have I Got News For You and Never Mind The Buzzcocks format , because they are mocking what they should mock . They always have really good guests on the show as well . They have had Brian McFadden , Trisha Goddard , Paddy McGuinness , Liza Tarbuck , Alan Carr , Robert Webb , Mel Giedroyc , Sara Cox , Fearne Cotton , Frankie Boyle , Rob Rouse and Jayne Middlemiss . It is clever , funny , interesting for facts , and a good show , just as good as 8 of 10 Cats ! Very good !
X-Rated : The Pop Videos They Tried to Ban	This is a programme narrated by Alexander Armstrong to find the most provocative X-Rated Pop Video ever created to shock , scare , fantasise and nearly got banned . It includes videos from Marilyn Manson , Britney Spears , Christina Aguilera , Aphex Twin , Duran Duran , The Prodigy , Snoop Dogg , Madonna , and the most x-rated video stars , Rock Bitch . There are many things that can make an x-rated pop video that are included : death , blood , violence , suicide , vomiting , drugs , strippers , nudity , sex , lesbians , orgies , ageist behaviour , blasphemy , and much more . With interviews by Alice Cooper , Jack Osbourne , Mike Read , the late Tommy Vance and Gina Yashere . Very good !
Sugar Rush	I admit when I first saw the advert I was interested in the lesbian storyline , but it turned out to be much more than that , it turned out to be one of the best British dramas I have seen in years . Basically attractive Kim ( Olivia Hallinan ) is a virgin obsessed with her best friend , the gorgeous Maria " Sugar " Sweet ( Lenora Crichlow ) , and she knows she is a genuine lesbian by the end , when they do finally get each other . It is when Sugar gets arrested that Kim moves on and finds love with sex shop owner and DJ , Saint ( Sarah-Jane Potts ) , and they really struggle to cope with all the distractions around them , and that includes Sugar . The sub-plot also sees Kim's parents , dad Nathan ( Richard Lumsden ) and mum Stella ( Sara Stewart ) first coping with an affair , and then becoming more interested in sex with other people , i . e . swinging . Oh , and you see Kim's brother Matt ( Kurtis O'Brien ) a couple of times too . It is serious , it is funny , and it is brilliantly written , a great adaptation of some popular books ( by Julie Burchill ) . It was nominated the BAFTA TV Award for Best Drama Series " production team " , and it won the International Emmy for Children and Young People UK . Very good !
The Iron Giant	For a cult cartoon , this is a really good representation and kind of re-imagination of Ted Hughes's popular book about The Iron Man , or Iron Giant . Hogarth Hughes is a young boy living just outside the town of Rockwell with his Mother Annie ( Friends ' Jennifer Aniston ) . One day he discovers something extraordinary , a giant man made of iron ( The Fast and the Furious's Vin Diesel ) that only eats metal . Hogarth and this giant become really good friends , they also befriend scrapyard owner Dean McCoppin ( singer Harry Connick , Jr . ) . Unfortunately , United States Government Agent Kent Mansley ( Flubber and Thelma & Louise's Christopher McDonald ) suspects Hogarth of looking after a monster , and the army soon gets involved . It won BAFTA the Children's Award for Best Feature Film . It was number 59 on The 100 Greatest Family Films , and it was number 12 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons . Very good !
Wipeout	When I was younger , in fact , whenever it was on , I always used to love this game show . They brought in three contestants and put them on posts . Basically they are given a subject to search for with at least twenty boxes to use . All twenty boxes have a name or word referring to the subject . The contestants take turns to select a square . If the square receives a tick they receive points to go towards the final round . If they get a cross they get a Wipeout and lose any previous points ( hence the title ) . The final round was most entertaining for me , when the contestant runs back and forth selecting squares to find all squares of a subject . Bob Monkhouse was just the perfect host for this game show , it's such a shame he died . Very good !
Family Guy	If there was no Simpsons or South Park , this could probably be the best cartoon series ever created . Creator Seth MacFarlane , who also voices Peter Griffin , Brian Griffin , Stewie Griffin , Glen Quagmire and Tom Tucker and many others has created a great adult comedy cartoon . Also starring Alex Borstein as Lois Griffin and Loretta Brown , Mila Kunis as Meg Griffin , Seth Green as Chris Griffin and Neil Goldman and regular guest Jennifer Tilly as Bonnie Swanson . Basically it's the same format as Simpsons , a family that have misadventures , a fat dad and each member having their own individual happenings . The only difference is that it has a baby and a dog , that can actually talk . And it's like South Park because of some bad language and violence included . Guests have included Drew Barrymore , Haley Joel Osment , Jay Mohr , Gene Simmons , Carrie Fisher , Patrick Duffy , Mary Kay Bergman and Will Ferrel . It has won 2 Emmys for Outstanding Music and Lyrics and Outstanding Voice-Over Performance , and it has been nominated for 3 Outstanding Animated Program ( For Programming Less Than One Hour ) awards and Outstanding Music and Lyrics . It was number 5 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons . Outstanding !
The Naked Gun	Based on the TV Series Police Squad , this is another successful spoof movie with a spy , but made by the geniuses who created Airplane ! Basically it is another excellent opportunity to see complete stupidity at it's best , or worst if you think about it from the hero's point of view . Leslie Nielsen as our " hero " , Leiutenant Frank Drebin is just the perfect idiot for the job , comes up with some stupid ideas , have stupid adventures and always causes a really terrible incidence , for himself and many others involved . This character is basically what makes the film such an excellent comedy to watch nearly again and again , he just doesn't realise how idiotic he is . Two sequels followed that are almost just as funny . Detective Frank Drebin was number 47 on The World's Greatest Comedy Characters , and the film was number 14 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films . Outstanding !
Comic Relief 2001	Comic Relief 2001 had everything you could want for comedy and charity together , especially from so many generous comedians and celebrities . I'm sure you see that I've already talked about Have I Got Buzzcock's All Over . But the segments that really stuck out for me were : Ted & Ralph - New Replacement starring Paul Whitehouse , Charlie Higson and Robbie Williams . Popsters starring Lenny Henry , Simon Pegg , Rowan Atkinson , Smack the Pony's Sarah Alexander , Coronation Street's Debra Stephenson and Peter Serafinowicz . EastEnders - Who Shot Phil Mitchell Exclusive starring all the EastEnders cast and Mel Smith , Harry Enfield , Bill Oddie , Danny Baker and Smack the Pony's Sally Phillips . Celebrity Big Brother starring Davina McCall , Vanessa Feltz , Chris Eubank , Claire Sweeney and winner Jack Dee . Finally , there was the wonderful Ali G ( Sacha Baron Cohen ) interview with David and Victoria Beckham , my favourite part . Also starring Jonathan Ross , Graham Norton , Zoë Ball , Harry Hill , Billy Connolly ( going nude ) , Alan Partridge ( Steve Coogan ) , Peter Kay , Frank Skinner , David Baddiel and many more generous celebrities . Outstanding !
Way Out West	Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history , and deservedly so , so I am happy to see any of their films . Basically Stan and Ollie are heading for the town of Brushwood Gulch to give the deed to a gold mine , property of Mary Roberts ( Rosina Lawrence , also Laurel's female singing voice ) after her father has recently died . Unfortunately they are tricked by bar owner Mickey Finn ( James Finlayson ) and his wife Lola Marcel ( Sharon Lynne ) , pretending to be Mary , to get the fortune for themselves . As they are about to leave , the real Mary Roberts reveals herself , and they realise they have been tricked , and there is a big squabble to get the deed back , before Stan and Ollie are chased out of town by the Sheriff ( Stanley Fields ) who warned them to leave . Just after Stan has eaten Ollie's hat ( which he said he would do if they didn't get the deed back ) , they sneak back into town to try and get the deed back . They do manage to get Mickey to open the safe with it , and it ends with the two boys and Mary riding out of town to head South . Also starring Vivien Oakland as Sheriff's Wife . This is among Laurel and Hardy's greatest films , at sixty minutes it features some of the best sequences and songs ever made , including the dance to " At The Ball , That's All " by The Avalon Boys , their hit song " Trail of the Lonesome Pine " , the ending song " We're Going to Go Way Down to Dixie " , and all the wonderful slapstick and classic comedy you could want from a black and white film , an excellent film . It was nominated the Oscar Best Music for Marvin Hatley . Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were number 7 on The Comedians ' Comedian . Outstanding !
Tom and Jerry	When I was younger , and still today this is one of the greatest cartoons ever . Tom the cat and Jerry the mouse are just the best chase and disaster duo ever created , especially from the imaginations of William Hanna and Joseph Barbera . Every episode is the same concept , Tom tries to catch Jerry , or Jerry does something to get Tom in trouble , but every episode has a new idea , a new disaster and fantastic new gags for kids and adults all over . The other characters were good as well , e . g . the Black woman , and Spike and his son . Tom having something done to his tail and his scream are just terrific . Through 1965-1972 the cartoon duo went through five stages of animation / production , the first ever episode ( where Tom is named Jasper ) by Rudolf Ising , the next 94 episodes all by the legendary Oscar winning Fred Quimby , the next 17 episodes by Hanna-Barbera , 13 episodes after by William L . Snyder ( all directed by Gene Deitch ) , and finally Chuck Jones produced 34 episodes with many directors ( including himself ) , all making 159 episodes in total . Seven episodes have won the Academy Awards for Best Short Cartoon . It was number 14 on The 100 Greatest Kids ' TV Shows , and it was number 2 on the 100 Greatest Cartoons . Outstanding !
Lost in Translation	Oscar , BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Sofia Coppola , daughter of famous Godfather director Francis Ford Coppola , has created a very simple but very effective idea for a film . Basically Bob Harris ( Golden Globe winning , and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Bill Murray ) is a famous actor doing photo shoots and adverts in Japan for a scotch drink . During his work related trip he meets Charlotte ( gorgeous BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Scarlett Johansson ) . They become really close friends , and if they both weren't married there could have been a closer relationship . Also starring Scary Movie's Anna Faris as Kelly and Giovanni Ribisi as John . The best sequences include Murray looking like Roger Moore's James Bond , and getting stuck on the exercise machine . But the intriguing moment is when Bob is about leave , and he whispers something you never hear in Charlotte's ear . It won the Oscar for Best Writing , Original Screenplay , and it was nominated for Best Picture , it won the BAFTA for Best Editing , and it was nominated for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for Kevin Shields and Brian Reitzell , Best Cinematography , Best Original Screenplay , the David Lean Award for Direction and Best Film , and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy and Best Screenplay . Scarlett Johansson was number 10 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols , and the film was number 12 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You Die . Outstanding !
