So bad it's PITIFUL .	This movie is so bad that it made me want to cry . It's about as funny as a plane crash with no survivors . But it's not only completely unfunny : it's also moronic and offensive . For two hours you're watching retards behaving like three-year-olds . The sexist and racist jokes are just plain pitiful . And the scene where Hanks ' girlfriend forgives him for lying to her and smiles sweetly is excruciating . I gave this " comedy " , a grade I've never used before . A pitiful movie . BLECCH .
Shameless and boring .	Anyone who has seen the utterly worthless original will rightfully wonder why a sequel was even filmed . But what's really inconceivable is that this so-called sequel is actually even worse that " Xtro " . A shameless " Alien " rip-off , terribly acted and full of very derivative effects . Trust all the comments and don't waste your time with this film .
A shapeless farrago .	" Waitress ! " is about as bad as a comedy can get . It can barely be called a movie ; it's more like a collage of randomly connected images and scenes that don't build from each other or move any sort of plot forward . And the editing is so rapid it may give you a headache . I'd give this dreadful film 0 . stars .
Atrocious	Frank is a tough LA cop ( what else in new ? ) who's had it up to here with the red tape that's been making his life difficult ( what else is new ? ) , so he recruits three female prisoners ( an ex-cop , an ex-marine and a gang member ) and trains them to combat crime in his own unorthodox way . The premise may be completely unbelievable , but it's also the only reason one could possibly have for watching " Street Angels " in the first place , as it involves three fairly hot girls kicking a . Other than that , this " film " is very bad . There is virtually no budget on display , and the fight choreography is painfully bad . There are also constant attempts at wit , and most of them are just annoying ( the main villain just won't shut his damn mouth ! ) , but occasionally they do hit a good one ( my favorite : " You'll name our team Street Angels ? That sounds like a bad no-budget action movie " ! ) .
Lethargically paced , ludicrously dubbed dullness .	A funny thing happened to me while watching " Mosquito " : on the one hand , the hero is a deaf-mute and the director is totally unable to make us understand why he does what he does ( mutilating mannequins . . . er , excuse me , corpses ) through his images . On the other hand , the English version at least is very badly dubbed . So I found myself wishing there had been both more AND less dialogue at the same time ! This film is stupid ( funny how this guy has access to every graveyard and mortuary in his town ) and lurid ( where would we be in a 70s exploitationer without our gratuitous lesbian scene ? ) . Not to mention the " romantic " aspect ( oh , how sweet ! ) . . . Miss it . ( )
What a dud !	A complete dud . Stuck with a stupid script and in the middle of moronic proceedings , Bill Cosby looks utterly bored and desperate . This is the type of film that has NOTHING redeeming about it , and even thinking about it for a minute longer than its running time is a real waste of effort . Worthless . ( )
Fifth-rate but sometimes amusing slasher film .	From a horror standpoint , " Memorial Valley Massacre " is a worthless slasher that no serious horror fan should bother with . What saves it from being a total bomb is the tongue-in-cheek approach of the filmmakers , at least in the first half . For example , early on a man says " We've got a problem with the water " ( the movie is set on a camp ) and proceeds to pull a dead dog out of the well ! Hilarious ! Then Cameron Mitchell ( who appears for about 2 minutes as an investor ; did he actually get paid for this ? ) asks : " Screw the dog , is the water fit to drink ? " ( ! ! ! ) . The film also includes the following exchange : " Are you the head ranger here ? " - " Well , I'm the only ranger here , so I guess you can say I'm the head one " . Oh , and the primitive kid who has lived all his life away from civilization , apparently knows how to create a gas explosion . ( )
BLATANT , BLATANT " Predator " knockoff	Astonishing in its audacity ! Bruno Mattei gathered a bunch of B-movie actors , threw them into the jungle , and then ripped off the basic plotline from " Predator " , ripped off whole lines of dialogue from " Predator " , ripped off the irrelevant action sequences from " Predator " , he even ripped off the " who-played-whom " - type closing credits from " Predator " ! The only difference is that the monster here is a robot instead of an alien . A very weird experience - check out the " monster's " kiddie voice ! ( )
UGH !	I can't believe there are four positive comments for this dud ! If you're tired of the James Bond pictures and you want to try a more " adult " and mature spy film , check out " The Ipcress File " , or even " The Naked Runner " , with Frank Sinatra ; they are far superior . " The Kremlin Letter " is poorly structured ( the main hero , for example , is kept offscreen for about an hour ! ) , nearly incomprehensible , uninvolving , talky , and loaded with so many stiff performances that you may wonder why they didn't hire some wax-museum figures instead ; they'd be a lot more lively . The lead has all the charm and acting talent of George Lazenby , and Orson Welles is used for decorative puproses only ; you never even understand what he's doing in the picture . The movie's only interesting moments come at the very end , when it finally manages to suggest how cruel and inhuman the world of espionage can sometimes be . And Richard Boone is the one actor who injects some life into his role . Otherwise , this is a fiasco of epic proportions .
Disconnected , awful horror film .	Three of the most famous horror stars appear in this film , but don't be fooled - it's definitely a complete dud , an incoherent , unbelievably bad pastiche of disconnected scenes . Peter Cushing's role is little more than a cameo and Christopher Lee just drops in and out of a few sequences . Only Vincent Price has some substantial screen time in the final 20 minutes - which is the only part of the movie that saves it from being utter trash . ( )
Inept .	The most annoying thing about this ludicrous " action " film is the contempt it shows for the audience . You get the feeling that the people involved just didn't care enough to make a good film , and the intentionally campy and preposterous moments seem merely an attempt to cover their own incompetence . Linda Marlowe is beautiful but most unconvincing in the title role , and many of the supporting performances are simply dreadful . And if you think the action sequences will redeem the picture , forget it ; they are so ineptly filmed that they become an offense to martial-arts fans . A monumentally bad flick . ( )
Offensive trash - with one memorable part	Much like Tinto Brass ( " Caligula " ) , the people who made this movie can't tell the difference between explicitness and eroticism . No build-up at all , just throw naked women on the screen ; no , it doesn't work that way . If close-ups of female genitalia aren't your thing , prepare to be looking away from the screen at many points ( I often did ) . The " all women are whores at heart " mentality of the movie is offensive , and the " story " is by turns absurd and boring ( the escape is the most boring part ! ) . But halfway through there is a random scene that pops out of nowhere and involves one of the ( female ) prisoners and one of the ( male ) guards in a nude wrestling match , which she wins with a couple of judo moves . Although the choreography of the fight is bad , the whole scene is undeniably memorable . In fact , that scene and the nice cinematography are the only two reasons I give this film out of 4 , instead of 0 .
You've been warned .	If you're a Leslie Nielsen fan , and you desperately want to see this movie , don't . It's a disastrous , too-frantic , headache-inducing , long , sloppily directed , senselessly written comedy . Read the comments on this page instead ; they are funnier ! I'll give it one star ( instead of none ) out of four though , simply for the rather elaborate production design . It's a shame that the people who worked on it saw their efforts wasted so badly .
Boring , cheesy , low-grade action film	In yet another case of misleading marketing , this film is included in a 10-movie DVD set called " Women Who Kick Butt " , but even in its original cover it seems to promise Shannon Tweed in an action role . Actually , during most of the movie Tweed plays the typical whiny and prissy female character who has to be rescued by the male lead , and even when she's trained in jungle warfare she still has to be dragged around by him ! There is one female rebel who is a stronger character , but she's mostly kept in the margins of the movie . The male lead is Reb Brown , and he does have some ( unintentionally , I think ) funny moments ( like when he gets electrocuted ) . The action scenes are badly directed and poorly acted : some of the stuntmen needed a few lessons on " how to get shot and die convincingly " . I suppose if you're in the right mood you can find some things in " Firing Line " to laugh at ( at one point , we can hear Tweed speaking but her lips are not moving ! ) , but mostly I was just bored . ( )
Not as good as the first .	This sequel to the 1994 actioner " No Contest " ( which I enjoyed much more than I expected to ) is a much inferior film . The fight scenes are not badly choreographed , but all the rest is just SO stereotypical and familiar . Shannon Tweed still is up to the game , but Lance Henriksen does his usual " psychotic villain " number , and we're not impressed anymore . ( )
A huge disappointment	After the wonderful " Omen " and the interesting ( if inferior ) " Omen II " , did we really need this ? It's a huge disappointment , a cheap-looking movie that lacks tension and is full of blah dialogue . The ending will make you angry .
Dreadful	Martian supercop chases Martian supervillain to Earth , and Yukari Oshima's special forces unit has to deal with them - and with warring criminal gangs on the side . " Ultracop 2000 " epitomizes nearly everything that can be bad about Hong Kong cinema - sloppy direction , incoherent script , lowbrow humor , obvious and silly wirework , jerky editing , etc . - while offering very little of the good - a few nice explosions and stunts that barely earn this film out of 4 stars . A word of advice : if you know someone who has never seen a HK film before , please don't let " Ultracop 2000 " be his / her first one or he / she may never want to see another one again ! A sad waste of Yukari Oshima , who deserves better than this .
Inept	This blatant AIDS allegory ( ok , we get it , we don't need to see the entire cast wrapped in plastic throughout the movie ) , is inept and put together with no filmmaking skill ( don't trust me , trust the facts : Nathan J . White hasn't directed another film since 1987 ) . It is set in a provincial town stereotypically inhabited by ignorant hicks who , in a crisis situation , turn into bloodthirsty madmen . And after the initial pretenses of seriousness , the film turns " comic " and silly . Oh , and if you can't afford convincing special effects , why bother pretending that gruesome deaths occur , only to keep them off-screen ? ( )
Almost crap .	They try for something weird , bizarre , unique in this film , but it all goes disastrously wrong - the weirdness seems forced . Right from the opening five minutes you realize that you're stuck for two - seemingly interminable - hours with a collection of unappealing characters and dreary situations , in a movie with a sense of humor that can be described as " self-conscious " at best . There are some interesting moments , of course , but most of the many famous performers are pitifully wasted . ( )
Disposable - though not disgraceful - slasher movie	Yet another slasher movie from the 80's . This one is set in a sports academy and has the novelty of the killer using a somewhat unorthodox weapon - a javelin . But that novelty wears off after a while . There is not much suspense , no real clues to the " mystery " part , and the ending - especially the motivation of the killer - is absurd . There is also a rather laughable scene where the killer enters a pool in full scuba gear , javelin in hand , and his / her soon-to-be-victim fails to notice anything and keeps on swimming ! On the plus side , there is ample nudity , a few well-done gore effects , the two main girls are cute , and most of the character interactions sound genuine . Enough good points to get this movie .
Even unfunnier than the first .	You know where you stand with " Mannequin 2 " early on , when you find out that the unfunniest character of the original has returned - and he has a bigger role to boot ! The " romance " part of the film is still kind of sweet , but Ragsdale is no Andrew McCarthy , and Kristy Swanson , unlike Kim Cattrall , doesn't bring any personality to her character ; she's beautiful but bland . In fact , that's the word that most accurately sums up the movie : bland . Its comic invention extends to " funny " accents , homosexual gags and chases in toy cars . If you like this sort of thing , go for it . ( )
Watchable but derivative " erotic thriller "	" Bound By Lies " wants to be an erotic thriller and a murder mystery . It fails because it is not very erotic , not very thrilling and not very mysterious . The two stars are rather over-the-hill for the genre . Kristy Swanson is still pretty , but by no means as irresistible as she's supposed to be here . She looked really great in the mid-90's - I wish she had done this kind of role then . I wish Natassia Malthe ( who plays Kristy's assistant in this film ) had the leading role instead . And Stephen Baldwin is no Alec , hell he's no William either . Stephen and Kristy " do it " only once , and in that scene he shows more than her ! There is an irrelevant car chase in the beginning ( which was mostly lifted from another film , according to IMDb trivia ) , and one good scene involving a handcuffed and tied Baldwin in a bathtub , but other than that you won't find many thrills here . As for the " mystery " plot , making the most obvious suspect the actual killer can only be called " unpredictably predictable " . However , I still found the film watchable enough to give it out of 4 stars .
Moronic vigilante epic .	It begins with a couple of disgusting sex-comedy gags , but soon it reveals its true colors : it wants to be a " Death Wish " clone . I say " wants to " because the script gets so increasingly laughable by the minute that it ends up looking like an absurdist " Death Wish " spoof ! From a love scene in a room inexplicably filled with candles , to " heroes " who dress up as commandoes and wave their machine guns because they don't want to attract attention to themselves ( ! ) , to bad guys who drive around the city in a black van long after it has been recognized as their vehicle , this film has too many ludicrous points to fit in a list . The other major problem is that you can't tell most of the characters apart ; of course , you know who Borgnine and Roundtree and even James Van Patten are , but all the other roles could have been played by different actors in various scenes , and you wouldn't know the difference . ( )
Tired and tiresome mystery flick .	" An Occasional Hell " is a low point in Tom Berenger's career . His acting in this picture is so lifeless that when people refuse to tell him what they know about the case he's investigating , he looks as if he's about to say " Fine , what do I care anyway ? " . The script is so slow-moving that at times it doesn't seem to be moving at all , and the direction is so pedestrian that , without the brief flashes of nudity , this could easily pass off as a TV movie . Apparently everyone associated with this movie was just too tired to even try making something good out of it . Everyone , that is , except Kari Wuhrer , who is incredibly sexy as always , and gives the film its only spark ; sadly , her role is all-too-brief . ( )
Mostly unfunny .	Many people found this movie , the second outing from the Farrelly brothers , to be hilarious , but I thought the funny moments were few and far between . Most of the time , this is a depressingly UNfunny , occasionally tasteless farce , that follows , and supposedly spoofs , the " Rocky " and the road-movie formulas , and has references to other recent movies ( like the " Indecent Proposal " , in one inspired little bit ) . As for the " offensive " factor , it's pretty low , despite its being " hyped-up " ; the only really disturbing scene is the aftermath of a dreaded sexual encounter . Woody Harelson does give a decent and believable performance , though . ( )
Really tacky .	The only thing " Force : Five " proves is that the chances of finding a good American martial-arts film are about as many as those of finding a good Hong Kong Western . Yes , the film stars real martial artists who obviously know their stuff , but keep in mind that : a ) most of them can't act ( Richard Norton is excepted ) b ) most of the time they're fighting useless morons who stand around like sitting ducks , waiting to be kicked . And how about the fact that the doors of the rooms where the " bad guys " keep their drugs-and-guns-for-sale and the dead bodies of their victims are unlocked and unguarded ? Cheap and stupid . But the actors sure know how to kick high . ( )
- all of them for Kay Lenz	This stereotypical , low-grade fantasy lacks both the budget and the directorial imagination to be really exciting . The only epic thing about it is the music score . The film is too cheesy for most adults , but it also has some unpleasant scenes that are unsuitable for kids - making you wonder what audience exactly they had in mind . What kept me watching it is Kay Lenz : she's both endearing and feisty , and she looks particularly sexy when she's angry . Her face has a great " bone structure " - she looks a bit like Kim Basinger ( trivia note : they were born the same year , 1953 ) , only more beautiful . And she can even keep a straight face through lines like " But . . . . he's green ! " ( when the male lead suggests that they should follow a man ) . Take Lenz out of the movie and you don't have a movie - just a midget , a giant , an evil John Saxon , and other stereotypes . ( )
Acceptable but flawed .	This bloody horror movie had the potential to be a terrific little picture ; great , inventive set design , original story , a likable kid as the lead . But the performances of the actors who play the villains get increasingly over-the-top ( " I got him ! I got him ! I got him ! " ) , and the movie begins to slip into self-parody . And there is also the matter of some exceedingly ugly scenes that were quite unnecessary ; we had already been convinced that the villains are really demented .
Disappointing Andy Sidaris fare	" The Dallas Connection " delivers the expected breasts , travelogue footage , explosions , and even some legitimate plot twists , but it has too many drawn-out non-action sequences , probably the result of Andy Sidaris & son Christian stretching the film to make it reach the 90-minute mark . As the female lead , Sam Phillips is a poor replacement for Suzi Simpson ( not to mention Dona Speir ) . Suzi did a very good job in " Enemy Gold " , and I wonder why Sidaris didn't cast her again . Sam is portrayed as useless in the action scenes . She is easily controlled by an unarmed man , while in " Enemy Gold " Suzi easily disarmed an armed man in about 3 seconds - see the difference ? Julie K . Smith and Wendy Hamilton ( a stunningly beautiful woman ) do about 95 % stripping and 5 % action . Julie Strain is fine as long as she doesn't have to speak - when she does , the illusion is ruined . In terms of the female action quotient , this is probably Sidaris ' most disappointing film since " Malibu Express " . ( )
Visually impressive but unmemorable .	This gory and somewhat dreamy horror film has acquired a cult following over the years , but don't count me among its fans . Argento does deliver some effective shocks ( especially in the scene where the face of the mutant kid is revealed ; it is far more grotesque and repellent than you might expect ) , but they don't add up to much . The film lacks substance , and its nice visuals can't completely make up for that . Warning : this pic is definitely not for the squeamish . ( )
Lots of heavy breathing and local color . . .	This is a great-looking film , filmed in rich colors and beautiful New Orleans locations . But dramatically it doesn't fare so well ; it's mostly a monotonous series of heavy-breathing sequences , interrupted by dialogue passages that seem to exist only because a film can't be made ONLY with sex scenes . We also get lots of gratuitous nudity from the statuesque Erika Anderson , who's married to Judge Reinhold ( fairly good , but not good enough to be taken absolutely seriously as a dramatic actor yet ) and pursued by Nicolas Cage ( in a smug performance he would probably like to forget today ) . Overall , not a horrible film , but not outstanding , either . ( )
Standard straight-to-video erotic / courtroom thriller	High-profile lawyer falls for her client , a suspect in a kinky murder case , but is he innocent or guilty ? Could she be in danger of becoming the next victim or is it all a conspiracy ? As you can see , " Forbidden Sins " is the umpteenth variation on the familiar " Jagged Edge " / " Body Of Evidence " formula and unfortunately this film is not made with enough energy or style to set itself apart from the pack , though it must be said that it is more explicit than most mainstream releases in this genre . Shannon Tweed herself has only one sex scene , but the woman is still in such fantastic shape that I'll push the rating of the film to a probably undeserved just for her .
How did that woman get yellow all of a sudden ?	This disappointing giallo does offer some atmospheric sequences and lots of nudity , but the story progresses in a very fragmented fashion , making it hard for the viewer to even tell the characters apart , and the gore effects are embarrassing , actually some of the worst I've ever seen in an Italian horror film . As for the identity of the killer , I have to admit the movie fooled me into a wrong guess . However , that doesn't say much ; considering " Torso " ' s obvious disregard for credible motivation , the killer could have been just about anyone . ( )
Aimless , but with some imaginative sequences .	One of Bronson's oddest films , but still not as odd as Morricone's ultra-weird score . The plot is standard " revenge " stuff , but there are some imaginatively shot sequences ( like the unexpected finale ) by the Italian Sollima , who shows some flair . The fast-cutting , " neurotic " editing is clumsy , however , and reminded me of the editing in " On Her Majesty's Secret Service " , which was made one year earlier . The widescreen photography really suffers on TV .
Trivial " Terminator " rip-off .	This is the first Don " The Dragon " Wilson movie I have ever seen , and nothing propels me to try out another one - sure , he is good at martial arts , but as an actor he has an uncharismatic screen presence . There's plenty of action in this film , with a new explosion every two minutes , and the effects are decent ( considering the low budget ) , but the final Wilson vs . Richard Norton ( a villain in some Jackie Chan movies also ) showdown is the only notable fight scene . stars if you look at this as a " normal " film , if you look at it as a " B-movie " .
Disappointing .	" Impulse " is a movie for which I had relatively high expectations : the idea of people losing the ability to control their impulses and totally disregarding all the established social rules sounds very , very intriguing . However , the result we get here is ( despite a few unexpected twists ) a disappointing and very slow-paced ( there is a dialogue-free passage where a man simply walks around for about seven minutes ) thriller . George Romero had used basically the same story ten years earlier in " The Crazies " - and he did it much better . ( )
Is Olivia Bonamy the most beautiful woman in the world ?	Probably not . But while I was watching this movie , I was thinking that she may be just that . She has an incredibly beautiful face ( she reminded me a bit of Kristy Swanson , the original " Buffy " - coincidence ? ) , a magnificent , toned , fit body , lovely red hair , a hip hairstyle , an irreverent attitude , and she handles her fight scenes competently . She's far and away the best reason to see " Bloody Mallory " - the rest is sometimes fun but mostly silly stuff . The mythology presented in this movie is actually quite interesting , but the script seems to be inventing and changing its rules as it goes along , and it often gets overly silly ( ghouls that get into karate fights , talking bats , etc . ) . The film also suffers from an overuse of CGI , and the monster effects are rather cheesy . It all ends with the setup for a sequel , but so far one has not materialized and chances are it never will . ( )
Blatant " Basic Instinct " clone ; fair on those terms	Of all the " Basic Instinct " copies that have been made since 1992 ( and there are plenty ) , " Dead Sexy " must be one of the most blatant . Sure , it switches the genders of the two main characters , but keeps almost everything else the same , right down to the only other suspect for the killings being someone within the police force who has hidden ties to the primary suspect . Of course " Dead Sexy " does not come anywhere near the style and suspense and general quality of the Verhoeven film , but on its own low-budget straight-to-video terms it's a fair way to pass some time . Shannon Tweed is acceptable , Sam Jones ( as her partner ) is even better , injecting some needed humor into the proceedings . As for the matter of the body double , I personally cannot understand why Tweed felt the need to use one . She showed everything - and it looked good as usual - in " The Rowdy Girls " , made in 2000 ; what could have changed so much over a year ? ( )
Average sequel .	In some of the dream and scare sequences , the director of " House IV " shows considerable talent and imagination . But the plot is just a rehash of old cliches , and toward the end it goes all over the map and creates quite a few gaps . Even horror movies have to establish some rules and play by them , this movie goes every which way but loose . Still , it's better than the dreadful " House II " . ( )
Solid B-movie	Having never seen the original , I found this sequel to be a competent little B-movie in its own right . Of course it has its flaws : it doesn't really bring anything new to the zombie sub-genre , there is a lack of genuine scares , and the script screws up the timeline near the end ( before going to the university for the second time , the three leads say they only have 10 minutes before the government blasts the whole place with missiles , but they take A LOT more time to go in there and get the blood sample they need ) . But it still has enough suspense , humor and gore to please those who know what they're getting into . The casting is solid : I particularly liked Emmanuelle Vaugier , who not only looks like a perfect video game heroine in her uniform and ponytail , but also handles her guns in a very confident , no-nonsense manner - like an extension of herself . And Victoria Pratt is certainly one of the most convincing actresses you can cast as a female soldier , body-wise at least . The film is made with a certain wit ( the " Shhhhhh " in the library , Sticky Fingaz's death scene - " No , no , I'm not infected - growl ! " ) , and the downbeat ending cleverly piques the curiosity ( even of people who may not have liked this movie ) for a possible third chapter . ( )
Silly .	Silly slapstick comedy is both sluggish and childish ( let's just say that it's less realistic than the average " Police Academy " sequel ) , but Terence Hill , with his acrobatic skills and use of everyday objects in the fight scenes , comes through as a somewhat slower version of Jackie Chan , and Bud Spencer's reactions and mutterings earn some laughs . ( )
Humdrum .	Humdrum , cliched actioner offers nothing we haven't seen before . If Eastwood ( who has a unique presence , even in this mediocre role ) wasn't around , it would be almost unwatchable . But the moral " lessons " of the film are even more annoying than its cliches : it seems to suggest that a " boy " becomes a " real MAN " only when he learns how to punch and kill people .
We're gonna need better jokes !	" The Curse Of The Jade Scorpion " offers a few smiles . That's hardly reason enough to sit through a motion picture . When a movie is centered almost completely around its jokes , it's the quality of the jokes that makes all the difference ; that's what separates , for example , the great from the not-so-great Marx Brothers films . And " Curse " is unfortunately closer to " The Big Store " than to " Duck Soup " : pleasant , inoffensive , but tired and forgettable ( and I mean that literally : after 2-3 days you won't even remember that you've seen it ) . Aside from Zhao Fei's remarkable cinematography , a very minor credit for Woody . ( )
Disposable sequel .	A funky , campy horror-comedy , in which the " horror " and the " comedy " parts don't combine ; they collide . You get some decent makeup effects and some straight brain-munching gore , then you get a silly scene ( the zombies staring admiringly at a female gymnast on TV ) than undermines the whole film . The acting is pretty bad , too ( except for the kid and the all-too-cool doctor , the cast showcases only one acting style : unending hysteria ) . Overall , I'd recommend this film only to zombie-movie completists , although it's far less unpleasant to watch than the next chapter of this series . ( )
Too much plot but some intensely sexy scenes .	A strange case , this movie . It's at its best when it explores the perverse ( past and present ) family ties that bind Leif Garrett and Greta Blackburn ( and she's has a powerful , sexy presence ) . But the script keeps intercutting their story with that of a misfit cop ( a real Dirty Harry wannabe ) and an ambitious female assistant DA who are searching for the killer that is slashing his / her victims ' throats with a razor . As you have probably already guessed , the film has too much plot , too many supporting characters ( what's Richard Roundtree doing here ? ) and too many plot coincidences . You could do a lot worse , though . ( )
Terrific girls - movie should have been better	Once again , this Sidaris film seems to have everything : a fit and quite believable as an agent Dona Speir , an incredibly adorable Hope Marie Carlton ( on a scale of 1 to 10 , her smile is a 12 ) , a gorgeous Roberta Vasquez , international locations ( Paris , Las Vegas , Texas , Hawaii , etc . ) , LOTS of explosions , outrageous gadgets , etc . The mix should have been explosively hot , but sadly it's only lukewarm . The execution of the formula is mechanical , as if Sidaris was simply ticking off action scenes from a list . There are very few funny lines ( the best belongs to Speir : when she's accused of being jealous , she says " there is not a jealous bone in my body - check it out for yourself " , and she disrobes ! ) and the one fight scene , involving Harold Diamond , is terrible . But to end this comment on a positive note , John Aprea gives a slick performance as the arch-villain of the story . ( )
It's OK .	This " Nightmare On Elm Street " wannabe is well-directed by Andrew Fleming , but too derivative to make much of an impression . Some icky scenes , a few bad effects and much better acting than you're accustomed to seeing in this genre . Undemanding horror fans won't be disappointed . ( )
Only Dunaway holds this movie together .	Playing a woman of slowly deteriorating mental health , Faye Dunaway dominates this movie . She graces it with her beauty and just about manages to keep us watching a story that's flawed and filled with implausibilities ( SPOILER : for example , how come an organization as powerful and sinister as the one the movie supposedly presents has left ONLY ONE person - and a foolish one at that - guarding the kidnapped kids ? ) . It's flatly directed , too . ( )
Spoiler . . .	Halle Berry's beauty is ALMOST reason enough to sit through any film , and here she's surrounded by a good supporting cast . But this glossy thriller ( great cinematography by Haskell Wexler ) spins a familiar tale , and in the end turns out to be a blatant rip-off of " The Usual Suspects " ( even using pretty much the same closing shot ) . The trick that " Suspects " pulled on the audience was quite unique , and this picture came out too soon afterwards not to be accused of plagiarism . ( )
Crazy , man , just crazy	If you're looking for a totally crazy and off-the-wall film , you should try to track down a copy of this one ( it won't be easy ) . It has everything : threesomes , car and motorcycle chases , ESP , cold war espionage and naked female assassins ( only one , in a very brief scene , but I thought I should mention it ) . The only things missing are narrative coherence and directorial competence ; at some points the continuity is so poor that it seems as if parts of the movie are missing . But considering its rarity , as well as the fact that it's Nico Mastorakis ' second film after the notorious " Devil In Mykonos " , this one has definite cult possibilities . It's not , however , as much of a flesh fest as the other reviewer suggests . ( )
Crazy HK Hodgepodge	Watching " Winners And Sinners " is like going on a treasure hunt : you have to suffer through a lot of corny , childish comedy to get a few prizes . The prizes include : Samo Hung's fight scenes , Yuen Biao's all-too-brief cameo , the long sequence with Jackie Chan that begins with an exhibition of rollerskating stunts , develops into a furious chase and ends with perhaps the biggest , most spectacular car pile-up ever staged , and the one funny scene with the " Lucky Stars " , in which one of them believes he is invisible ( ! ) . This movie is a mixed bag at best , a scam at worst ( for Jackie fans , since the packaging fools them into thinking that he has a major role ) . ( )
Dumb and run-of-the-mill but well-done .	" Friday The 13th , Part VII " is probably the slickest and most professionally done entry in the series . There are some attempts at creating some " normal " , believable and likable characters along with the usual stereotypical ones . The reason this movie and the previous two parts are superior to the first four cheapies of the series is that major improvements took place on the levels of acting and pacing , and the production values also got better . Unfortunately , this movie is partially ruined by its idiotic climax , where Jason " dies " about four separate times in 10 minutes - and then gets up again . It was too cartoonish to be considered even self-spoofing . Another weak point : while the effects are generally solid , the scene where we see Jason's face behind the mask is unintentionally hilarious ! I mean , he is supposed to be a deformed - even de-composed - corpse , not an " Alien " - looking monster . Still , as a run-of-the-mill slasher pic , this is watchable .
" What the hell is going on here ? " ( actual quote ) .	I found this movie slightly better than the first " Tetsuo " ( which I HATED ) , mainly because it appears at first to be willing to tell a more coherent ( if still unique ) story . Soon , however , the story disappears into a farrago of violence , mayhem and senselessness ; by the time the completely baffling ending arrives , you've already given up trying to make sense out of what's happening . However , there are some ingenious special effects and a breakneck chase scene that's worth seeing . ( )
Sloppy but good-natured .	This horror spoof contains enough corny jokes to last you a lifetime , but is generally harmless and even has a certain schlocky charm . Produced on an obviously low budget and sloppily directed by Larry Cohen , it tries to do for werewolf flicks what " Airplane ! " had done for disaster epics the previous year , but it's just too " unpolished " to succeed . ( )
Slow , obvious thriller .	The script telegraphs all of its " surprises " , the direction is strictly by-the-numbers and Dylan McDermott is a bland lead . There are only two noteworthy elements in this movie : the dangerous , edgy intensity Tom Sizemore brings to his role , and a couple of steamy moments provided by Sharon Stone , who was then at her best-looking phase ; at one point she actually says to McDermott : " Don't fret , you ' ll get the check in a week and you can have me now " . Now that's what I call a GOOD DEAL . ( )
The right grade for this film . . .	. . . is something around a " " . If you take Anna Nicole Smith out , it is a decent action film , with nice explosions , respect-worthy stunts ( people falling from great heights or being burned alive ) , and a few surprisingly solid martial arts fights with Branko Cikatik . And yet until today more than half of the 700-something people who have voted on " Skyscraper " gave it a " 1 " - obviously because of ANS ( and quite a few people gave it a " 10 " - again , obviously because of ANS ) . Yes , her acting is on a high-school play level , and her grotesquely over-sized breasts are a matter of taste , but you can't say that she doesn't make an effort . But if you're thinking of getting this movie just to see her nude , don't - the two sex scenes run a total of 5 minutes in a 90-minute movie and feel like they were added in post-production ( and in what might be an attempt to keep the ladies happy as well , the film includes a fair number of hunky males in it - seriously , these terrorists might have a more profitable career as fitness models ) . Overall , this is about on a par with ANS's other film , " To The Limit " ; take that as you will . ( )
Dreary .	" Dragonslayer " is a dreary and gloomy fantasy that isn't nearly as much fun as it should have been . It needed a stronger sense of pacing , and more engaging characters . The much talked-about special effects are generally very convincing , although the dragon's face appears to be a bit stiff in close-ups . There are some interesting sequences ( the lottery , the climax ) , but for some reason I never found the movie really exciting . And kids will probably like only a few parts of it . ( )
Disappointing " sequel "	First of all , I would like to say that I find Leonard Maltin's review of this film rather inaccurate . " Amusing SPOOF of prison films " ? Calling " The Big Bird Cage " a spoof is like calling " Die Hard " a spoof of action films because it contains some wisecracks and comic-relief characters . That said , I found this film inferior to its predecessor in pretty much every aspect . It is more exploitative , the direction has no pace , the characters are not as strongly drawn and Roberta Collins is sorely missed ( Candice Roman is a pretty blonde , but not as pretty as Roberta ) . Pam Grier's dominating presence ( especially in the scene where she proclaims herself the leader of the prison camp ) is not only the best , but one of the few things that this film has going for it . ( )
Stupid but palatable .	This corny sequel to " Escape To Witch Mountain " is full of stupid and convenient plot devices ( smart goat ! ) , the performances by the kids are awkward , Bette Davis and an obviously slumming Christopher Lee are here only to lure some adults into thinking the movie might have some interest for them too ( it doesn't ) and the special effects run hot and cold ( some good , some embarrassments ) . Despite all that , the film does have a few good ideas , such as pitting the two " magical " kids against each other for much of the duration . Of course , they are both so obnoxious that I was secretly hoping they would go ahead and kill each other off , but no such luck ; this is Disney , after all . ( )
Too bland .	The writer and director , Alan Alda ( who also stars , sporting an unflattering haircut ) , enters Woody Allen territory here , but the result is unfortunately bland and forgettable . He seems to know all the right moves and maintains an agreeable tone , but there isn't enough wit in the lines , or enough laughs , or enough insights into the characters . Ann-Margret does look sensational , however . ( )
Only mildly compelling	" Owning Mahowny " is not a bad film , and you probably won't regret seeing it . On the other hand , you don't need to rush out to see it , either . It's based on a true story , but I'm not quite convinced that it was a story worthy of being made into a film . Let's see , what are the two main things we learn from this one ? 1 ) If you embezzle large amounts of money from the bank you work in , you'll eventually get caught , and 2 ) If you're an obsessive gambler you're doomed , because most of the time you'll be losing and even when you're winning you won't be able to just pick up your winnings and walk away . I think we all knew these things before we sat down to watch the film . A lot of praise has gone to Philip Seymour Hoffman's acting here ; indeed , he is so good at portraying this monotonous man that I found him . . . well , monotonous . Minnie Driver ( in what is possibly the most unflattering haircut of her career ) is wasted as Mahowny's ever-understanding girlfriend . The truly outstanding performance is given by John Hurt as the enigmatic casino boss , who simultaneously pities , admires , likes and exploits Mahowny . If you're interested in movies about obsessive gambling , you might want to check out the 1974 flick " The Gambler " , with James Caan . ( )
Mediocre Bond outing	" Mediocre " seems to be the best word to describe this movie : as Bond flicks go , it's nowhere near the bottom of the barrel ( " Diamonds Are Forever " , " The Man With The Golden Gun " ) , but it's not at the top of the list ( " Goldfinger " , " For Your Eyes Only " ) either . It certainly begins promisingly enough , with lots of humor , and contains perhaps more offbeat elements than any other Bond movie ( the voodoo rituals , the funerals / celebrations , the fact that EVERYBODY seems to be on Bond's tail ) . But in the second half dialogue and plotting are forgotten ( something that , contrary to popular belief , never happened in the best series entries ) , and the film degenerates into a series of frankly boring chases . Moore makes a comfortable and assured debut as 007 ; Jane Seymour is a lovely but bland Bond girl ; and Yaphet Kotto may be one of the best actors ever to play a Bond villain , but his part is underwritten . ( )
Chan is effective in one of his more serious roles .	Although the complete lack of comedy may disappoint some of Jackie Chan's fans , I found him quite fascinating to watch in this more serious part ; he proves , once and for all , that he CAN act , and he handles his complex relationship with the chief villain ( who is not as one-dimensional a character as you might expect ) particularly well . Perhaps if you're unaccustomed to Hong Kong action cinema , the frenetic pacing and chaotic storytelling , combined with the ( bad , of course , but not unacceptable this time ) dubbing , can create a disorienting effect . But the action starts early on and never lets up , and the fight scenes , while not numerous , are AMAZING . ( )
Great special effects in the service of thin stories .	The first story is thin , and features some surprisingly bad acting from such well-known names as Christian Slater and Julianne Moore . The second story is also thin , but better than the first , and features solid gore effects . Harrison's direction is also at its most imaginative in this one . The third story is the best of the lot ; although it feels rushed and underdeveloped , it has great special effects and a chilling " moment of revelation " . Overall , not bad but nothing special . ( )
Entertaining enough .	I haven't read Dean Koontz's novel , but most of this movie's faults can be traced back to predictable and simplistic script , which bears a strong resemblance to " The Eyes Of Laura Mars " . Otherwise , this is an entertaining horror thriller , with trippy " tunnel vision " ( literally ) sequences , flashes of dark humor and the usual good performance by Jeff Goldblum . The " good vs . evil " climax does come off a bit cheesy , but that doesn't happen because the effects are not good ; it happens because of the way in which they are employed . ( )
A pleasant surprise .	No great shakes in terms of scripting and originality , but this interesting horror film has an unusual , realistic edge that sets it apart from most routine thrillers . Well-drawn characters and first-rate effects make this a perfectly decent , if minor , effort . The explosive final sequence is very well-edited .
Predictable early-30s comedy elevated by wonderful cast	There are two main things going against " Platinum Blonde " : it's drearily predictable and simplistic ( how long will it take Williams to realize that Young is the right gal for him , and that he prefers his old lifestyle ? ) , and apart from a few shots that take advantage of the rich family's huge house , it has no cinematic ( visual ) interest . What it does have is a lot of snappy dialogue , some funny moments ( " Your mother wants to kiss me ? Give me back my letters ! " ) and a wonderful cast - especially the women : Jean Harlow really is the kind of woman that could seduce you and make you do crazy things , and Loretta Young really is the kind of girl you'd want to spend the rest of your life with . But even in the supporting cast ( the butler , the mother-in-law , the newspaper boss ) , everyone fits his or her role perfectly . ( )
Enjoyable female buddy Western	The pairing of Salma Hayek and Penelope Cruz in action roles and a Western setting sounds like an idea that can't miss - and it doesn't . The two women make a dynamite team and are just plain enjoyable to watch together . Personally I'm not the biggest Cruz fan , but she impressed me in this film , particularly with her gun tricks . The leads get able support from a clever but physically clumsy Steve Zahn , a creepy Dwight Yoakam and a gruff Sam Shepard . Even the horses are amazingly well-trained and add to the action and comedy . The directors maintain a lively pace , with the exception of the " kissing lesson " scene , which develops into a running gag that falls flat . The film's attempts at substance ( " Viva la revolucion ! " ) also come off as forced , but as a piece of lightweight fun " Bandidas " does the job . Highlight : the wonderful fight between Cruz and Hayek , this scene is a dream come true . ( )
Unexceptional Hitchcock fare .	" Young and Innocent " is a passable but unexceptional Hitchcock thriller ; it is inferior to his preceding ( " Secret Agent " ) picture and FAR inferior to his following ( " The Lady Vanishes " ) one . There isn't enough suspense , and the script is devoid of surprises ; in fact , the whole story is so exceedingly SIMPLE that the film feels slow-moving , even though it's only 80 minutes long . And Hitchcock collaborates here with one of the least appealing female leads of his entire career . Still , the picture does improve in the second half , and the much-talked-about scene where the identity of the killer is revealed is indeed a magnificent , unforgettable shot . Hitchcock also handles the increasing nervousness of the twitching killer exceptionally well . Why couldn't the rest of the film be equally inventive ?
All setup , no payoff .	Jodie Foster is indeed impressively good in this movie , and she is perhaps the only actress who could have pulled off such a challenging role at such a young age . However , the script is disappointing . It's the kind of story that keeps you watching by implying that many big revelations will be made , and when the revelations do arrive they prove to be less-than-shocking . There's only one moment in the film ( when the seemingly vanished father appears ) that it looks like there's gonna be a REAL SURPRISE , but that moment lasts only about 20 seconds , in which you have enough time to guess what is actually happening . Worth seeing only for Foster , and for her co-stars who are all very good , too . ( )
A good movie with too many slow passages .	Though undeniably well-intentioned , " Gallipoli " just isn't as wholly compelling as it should be . It seems to ramble on for an inexcusably long amount of time , getting lost in too many side trips , before finally hitting its target ( and rewarding our patience ) with a powerful and memorable ending . Mel Gibson , strikingly handsome , also gives a striking performance . ( )
" Well you must have upset someone , or else I wouldn't be here "	Yvette Mimieux looks gorgeous and gives a fine , understated performance as a contract killer who methodically seduces her targets , waits until they have let their guard down , and then strikes - lethally . But problems arise when she decides that she wants to quit the business . What I particularly liked about Yvette's performance here is that she presents the character and lets the viewer decide how he or she should feel about her . She doesn't force-feed you the answers , and neither does the movie . It proceeds economically from scene to scene , telling a seemingly simple story , but the unexpected twist at the end of it has real impact . Be warned : it's not an action movie ( though there is one car chase ) , it's more of a character drama . ( )
Lethargic Chabrol " thriller " ( SPOILERS ) .	Any rating higher than 2-2 . for " Merci pour le chocolat " is sheer critical prejudice in favor of French cinema in general . This dull thriller is subtle to the point of lethargy , relentlessly talky and lacks credibility ( at the end Mouglalis agrees to drive Huppert's car , at night , on a twisty mountain road , even though she practically knows that she has just been poisoned with sleeping pills ! ) . At least piano-music aficionados will get an earful . . .
Too many holes , but still a fair film .	Okay , the premise and story ARE cliched . But the film is executed with a far greater degree of skill than you'd expect from the director of such undistinguished ( if not downright bad ) films as " Night of the Demons " . His direction here is more mature and measured ( though not without its effective " Boo ! " moments ) . However , the film suffers from one of those annoyingly ambiguous endings , where the filmmakers can't think of a way to cover up their plot holes , so they " leave you to decide " . ( )
Slow Western for patient viewers	This ritualistic Western must be one of Marlon Brando's least-seen films , and no wonder . The plain story moves very slowly , and Brando himself never fully slips into his role ( and the Western environment ) . The film's few highlights include a tense armwrestling match , in which the defeated man will be stung by a deadly scorpion , and the final showdown between Brando and John Saxon ( who's quite good ) . ( )
Disjointed mess almost rescued by climactic fight sequences	When a movie pairs up the beautiful and graceful Cynthia Khan with the athletic and charismatic Yuen Biao , you expect something better than what " Tough Beauty and the Sloppy Slop " turns out to be . This movie is a frantic , disjointed mess , way over-the-top for a " modern " action flick ( people jump off tall buildings , get thrown 30 feet away and sometimes even float in the air ) . What's worse , the subtitles are not only grammatically awful but also often unreadable ( against white backgrounds ) , which makes the viewing experience painful . Thankfully , we at least get an action-packed climax , with some very entertaining fight sequences which FINALLY remind us what made HK cinema so popular in the first place . The last 15 minutes almost make up for the rest of the movie . ( )
Can a movie be overrated and underrated at the same time ?	Probably the most controversial Bond film to date ( along with " On Her Majesty's Secret Service " , with which it shares a lot of similarities ) , " Casino Royale " has been described as anything from " the best Bond movie ever " to " the worst Bond movie ever " . After watching it twice , now that the hype has died down a little , I would call it simply an above-average Bond film , give it a , and rank it somewhere alongside " The Living Daylights " and " The World Is Not Enough " . One of the problems with CR is that it doesn't seem 100 % sure of the type of Bond audience it's going for : those who want the class and intelligence of films like " From Russia With Love " and " Goldfinger " , or those who prefer the Rambo Bond mentality of films like " License To Kill " and " Tomorrow Never Dies " ? It ends up going for both , and at times you feel as if you're watching 2 or 3 different films : for example , the expressionistic Black & White prologue that recalls the style of classic film noirs is soon followed by a laughably excessive foot chase sequence ( " Someone is chasing me . I know , I'll climb up a crane so we can fight there , that seems to be a good idea ! " ) that seems to exist only for " wow " purposes . The movie dares , to its credit , to spend a lot of time around a poker table , where all the action occurs in looks , words and gestures , but not before another extraneous and over-the-top chase / fight scene at an airport . The production values are very high and the international locations are often breathtaking , but some of the dialogue is unbelievably corny ( Le Chiffre's " I see you take good care of your body " to Bond is the most homoerotic line in the series since Mr . Wint's " She's very attractive . . . . for a woman " in " Diamonds Are Forever " ) . Leaving aside my pro-Brosnan prejudices , I must say Daniel Craig surpassed my expectations as the new 007 . He brings a harshness to the role that is comparable to Timothy Dalton's , except he has more style than him and is better at the playful banter . However , in his second film he will have to play a more suave and experienced Bond , and it remains to be seen how he'll pull it off . Eva Green is fine ( and prettier without makeup ) , but the woman that caught my eye more was Ivana Milicevic , as the villain's girlfriend , who has one of the sexiest backsides I've ever seen . Sadly , her role is small and mostly silent . As Le Chiffre , Mads Mikkelsen is IMO one of the weak spots of the movie . He is more of a poser than a threat , and the fact that we see him getting bullied by other characters in the film doesn't help any . Jesper Christensen , although he doesn't appear in more than 3 scenes , creates a more interesting villainous presence as the mysterious Mr . White . Judi Dench as M is a plus , but there are no other memorable minor characters , unlike , say , " Goldeneye " , where you also had Xenia , Zukovsky , Boris , Orumov , Q , etc . My conclusion , based on the length ( 140 minutes ) , the way Craig plays Bond and the plot turns in the last 30 minutes of the film , is that CR could be described as a better-made modern version of OHMSS . It presents things that some people never want to see in a Bond movie ( Bond falling in love , quitting the service , a downbeat ending , etc . ) while others like them so much that they proclaim the film a masterpiece . In a series as long as this one ( 21 official films and counting , plus " Never Say Never Again " ) , preferences are always going to be even more subjective than usual . But if you rank OHMSS among the top Bond films ( personally I don't ) , then you'll probably do the same with this one .
Classy but bland horror fare .	Well , it does have more class and wit than you normally expect to find in the typical slasher movie . But let's not get carried away here . . . it's still just a reworking of a very familiar formula . Actually , it's mostly the generally likable cast that keeps this one ( slightly ) above average . ( )
Intriguing but lumbering .	The first half of " The Nanny " has an intriguing air of ambiguity : we have a smooth-talking nanny who may be a nut and a spoiled , rude little boy who may be acting this way simply because he feels trapped and scared . Who is guilty and who is innocent ? Unfortunately , we learn the answer to that question too early , and after that the movie gets increasingly predictable . The performances are excellent ( the actor who plays the kid steals the show ) , but the film suffers from lumbering pacing .
Overplotted but stylish .	This interesting cop thriller has a convoluted plot that gets a bit out of hand in the second half , with improbable , needless twists added only to provoke a surprised response on the audience's part ( consider , for example , Mickey Rourke's true identity ) , but it has been stylishly directed by Roger Donaldson ( who has already shown his competence with the first-rate " No Way Out " ) and acted with restraint by the three leads ; Rourke is particularly magnetic . Samuel Jackson also has an amusing supporting role . ( )
Hypnotic .	Not quite the underrated masterpiece other people are talking about , I'm afraid . It begins well enough , with an atmospheric , out-of-this-world Tangerine Dream score and hypnotically slow direction , but the story tips its hand too early ; the basics ( if not the particulars ) of its plot become rather obvious to us well before they do to the characters . Still , this is above average for an early-80s horror film . ( )
Kind of cool and pleasant . . . . .	" Species " has a hopelessly derivative premise that makes it a completely unnecessary view for anyone who has ever seen " Alien " or " The Predator " ( or their sequels ) , but it does have some things going for it . To be short and specific : Natasha Henstridge is dreamily , extraordinarily beautiful ; the rest of the cast is distinguished , with a very cool Michael Madsen stealing the show ; the special effects are convincingly yucky ; and the pacing is fast and unrelenting , with the " search-and-destroy " team being always only one step behind the pursued alien " monster " . A forgettable film , but not nearly as bad as many reviews have suggested . ( )
Predictable comedy .	Although it was co-written by David Zucker , this comedy is more conventional than , say , the " Naked Gun " series ; it doesn't have the same rapid-fire , relentless pacing . However , it does have a number of successful gags ( when the teacher enters the ghetto area , his car radio will play ONLY rap music ) , and , of course , the gorgeous Tia Carrere . . . . wow ! ( )
Run-of-the-mill Disney outing .	This one is an adequate time-filler , but , surely , it won't be hard to find many other films to watch when you just need to sit back and spend two hours painlessly . It's an uninspired , undistinguished Disney comedy , with OK performances but a predictable storyline . The brightest moments are contributed by David Niven , who gives some class to the whole production .
A few boring moments , many terrific ones .	Although this film is difficult to follow at times ( and , reportedly , historically inaccurate , too ; I wouldn't know ) , there are still several reasons to see it : 1 ) Glenda Jackson's outstanding performance ( you won't believe that the actress we see at the final stages of the film is the same one who played Tchaikovsky's wife early on , but it is - her transformation is amazing ) . 2 ) Some truly impressive sequences ; be sure to watch this movie on tape , so you can rewind it and watch them again . 3 ) Tchaikovsky's music , of course . 4 ) Lush sets and costumes . Ken Russell is a very unpredictable director ; just when you think the film is about to start boring you , he'll give you a wonderful moment out of nowhere .
Poirot the burglar	A high society lady turns to Hercule Poirot for help : a secret love letter she had written in the past has fallen into the hands of a blackmailer , who now wants 20 thousand pounds to give it back to her . When that man goes to Paris for a few days , Poirot and Hastings decide on a bold course of action : they will break into his apartment and look for the letter themselves ! This is a somewhat atypical entry in the Poirot series : for the most part it appears to be a straightforward blackmail story , and Poirot does more snooping around than sleuthing . But of course there is a twist in the tale - and a quite clever one at that . There are also some pretty funny moments in this episode - when Inspector Japp finds Poirot locked in a cell , he says to a younger officer : " Nobody knows his real name , but they call him " Mad Dog " " . The climax takes place inside London's Natural History Museum . ( )
With this cast , it can't miss ( completely ) .	This predictable and formulaic Western will not blow you away with its brilliance , but it IS fun , carried along almost entirely by the strong presences of its top stars . Only Jim Kelly and his karate moves feel out of place . And it also must be mentioned that the big moment that you all ( ? ) have been waiting for , a fight between Jim Brown and Fred Williamson , does arrive in this film . . . . but the scene is terribly unrealistic-looking . ( )
Riveting thriller - Argento is still a master	For anyone , like me for instance , who thought that Dario Argento's previous movie , " Sleepless " , went overboard with violence , it's nice to see a more restrained Argento where the impact comes not so much from gore as from the suggestion of gore ( though there are a couple of scenes , like the close inspection of dead bodies , that are not for the squeamish , even if you know they're just mannequins ! ) . In fact , apart from not having a great actor like Max Von Sydow in its cast , I found " The Card Player " superior to " Sleepless " in nearly all respects . Argento still knows how to create suspense and play with the audience ; Stefania Rocca is a very capable lead , a REAL WOMAN , instead of some supermodel posing as a cop ; and Liam Cunningham bears a striking resemblance to Jean Reno . I would have given this film an even higher rating , if it weren't for two things : 1 ) The most obvious ( after a point ) suspect turns out to be the killer ; what happened to the good old red herrings ? 2 ) The climax walks a fine line between the suspenseful and the ludicrous , and probably falls to the side of the latter . ( )
Surprising ending .	SPOILERS SPOILERS Jack Palance plays a tough cop , modelled on Dirty Harry . He's so frustrated about the leniency of the judicial system that he decides to take the law into his own hands and become what the title implies . As these things go , this film is not bad at all . The action sequences are well-handled , the ending is surprising , and there is one small but subtle and insightful touch ( Minor Spoiler ) : when Palance kills the first villain , in cold blood , he covers his face with a handkerchief before going down the stairs , just as his victim had previously done after HE had killed a woman in cold blood . Interesting . ( )
Truly off-the-wall .	I'm not 100 % sure they knew what they were doing when they were making this film , but what they came up with is an offbeat , entertaining mess . Lauren Ambrose is cute and fun in her role ( s ) ; her performance practically makes the movie . The rest of the cast , comprised mostly of unknowns , is also likable and has conviction ( though Busch's transvestite cop is somewhat annoying ) . If you're looking for a mindless and insubstantial film that won't insult your intelligence , " Psycho Beach Party " should fill the bill . ( )
" The Tenant " meets " Rear Window " ; excellent until the last 10 minutes .	When the build-up of a movie is as good as it is in " The 4th Floor " , the third act will almost inevitably have to be somewhat disappointing . The director , who is a first-timer to boot , does a very good job of creating a sinister , eerie atmosphere and keeping us hooked , always in doubt about who the guilty party is . Then in the last 10 minutes , it all becomes a routine slasher film , complete with half-baked plot " explanations " and a gratuitous " twist ending " . Still , for the most part this an excellent little thriller , and definitely worth your time . ( )
Top-notch .	By no means a great movie , but a top-notch BOND movie . Connery isn't yet as entertaining as he later became ( especially in " Thunderball " ) , but he is certainly more confident and likable than he was in " ' Dr . No " . This is probably the only GENUINE spy movie in the series , and it contains ( in my opinion ) the best-sustained sequence of all the Bonds ( the Connery-Shaw fight and the 15 minutes leading to it ) . Unfortunately , the two following climaxes ( especially the boat chase ) can't approach the same level of quality . It's still above-average .
Elevated by the acting .	An intelligent , thoughtful , extremely well-acted drama . Both Gene Hackman and Melvyn Douglas perform with great restraint , helped by a script that gives them fully-drawn characters to play . The direction , although not the most important element in this type of film , also has its moments , like a visit to an old-age home that is presented as a descent into Hell . But there is a burden that keeps this film from being a really great one ; its overwhelming banality . ( )
A minor Hitchcock outing , but consistently entertaining .	" Family Plot " , Hitchcock's last film , is nearly forgotten today ; even when later Hitchcock films are discussed , " Frenzy " and " Torn Curtain " come to most people's minds . But it is an entertaining , thoroughly watchable , consistently absorbing film . Lehman wrote a very clever plot , carefully structured and filled with ironic twists , and he also provides some witty dialogue . Hitchcock's direction just doesn't have the pacing and zest you might expect ( after all , he was 77 years old when he made this ) , but technically it's excellent and the sequence with the car that goes downhill in a twisty mountain road and has no brakes is exceptionally well-edited . Unlike " Frenzy " , this film also has engaging performances by all the actors involved ( Dern is the standout ) . The only disappointment here is the finale , that comes more or less as an anticlimax .
Slick and " adult " sci-fi .	A slick , clever , engaging and unique ( if a bit slow-paced at first ) sci-fi story . Although the special effects leave something to be desired , especially if you've seen the incredible ( and incredibly nauseating ) images of the 1986 remake , the film's restrained approach to horror can be very pleasurable if you get used to it , and the script is stronger and more character-driven than the one of Cronenberg's version . A surprisingly good film . ( )
A pleasant diversion - but a little overrated .	Lightweight , enjoyable comedy , with first-rate performances by Martin and Tomlin . The supporting cast is adequate and there are some genuine ( if scattered ) laughs . However , the film is nothing more than a pleasant little diversion . Every time I watch it , the same thing bothers me : it looks very cheap and underproduced , with murky cinematography . It has an inexplicable TV-movie feel , which certainly doesn't do justice to the actors ' terrific work .
Not great , but certainly fun .	This fun , ultra-violent Western is very close to the Leone-spaghetti style . Franco Nero is no Clint Eastwood , of course , but he's an acceptable substitute ( although he's hampered by the fact that his voice is dubbed , which is a pity because Nero's own voice is one of his best features ) . No masterpiece , but has hardly a dull moment . ( )
Generally a success .	" And Now For Something Completely Different " is an entertaining , if very uneven , compilation film , moving along so quickly and including so many different sketches that it's hard to reject it as a whole , even when you dislike some parts . Brilliant episodes ( " Dead Parrot " , " Mountaineering Sketch " , " Upper-class Twit-Of-The-Year Competition " ) alternate with bummers ( " The World's Deadliest Joke " , " Marriage Councelor " ) and with mildly funny parts ( The accountant that wants to become a lion tamer ) , but the film generally maintains that surrealistic , subversive Python flavor that their fans seek .
Predictable , but a delight .	This first teaming of Doris Day and Rock Hudson is a delightful , visually beautiful comedy - old-fashioned but hardly dated . The two stars make a charming , shiny couple ( it's easy to see why they were so popular in their time ) and Thelma Ritter steals the show in a needless but funny supporting role . The only problem you may have is that the course of the plot seems to be thoroughly predetermined from the first frame , but the film does a pretty good job of delaying the inevitable . Great sound effects , too . ( )
Rich , moving , beautifully made .	" The Swimmer " must rank among the most beautifully filmed pictures of its era ; few other 60s films featured such vibrant cinematography and such revolutionary ( for the time ) camerawork ( notice the scene in which a horse is reflected in Lancaster's eye ) . Lancaster gives a subtle , powerful performance ( " I'm a noble and splendid man " ) , which is perhaps his best . The film is a tad TOO elliptical , as I think that a little more background information about the central character would have made it slightly more satisfying . And the ending , which was perhaps meant to be a surprise , seems pretty transparent now , as there are many clues which point to it . However , this is still a moving , adult film , which deserves to be seen at least once . ( )
