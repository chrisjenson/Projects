A Nutshell Review : Next	I was wondering the strange selection of Nicolas Cage movies to hit the big screens here . There was no love for his Weather Man or Lord of War , which seem on the surface to be probable successes , and I thought World Trade Center was a mediocre effort , no doubt hitting the big screens because of the subject matter , and helmed by Oliver Stone , who seem to be quite muted and didn't turn on the controversy tap . His latest , recent effort in Ghost Rider was fun , but unmemorable . Philip K . Dick's science fiction stories too have their fair share of hits and misses when translated to the silver screen . There's the cult classic Blade Runner by Ridley Scott , the box - office success of Total Recall by Paul Verhoeven , the new-age photo-realistic animation A Scanner Darkly by Richard Linklater , Steven Spielberg's Minority Report credited with Colin Farrell's noticeable appearance , and John Woo's Paycheck which made Uma Thurman look ugly without the use of prosthetics . Big stars too get attached to these pictures , from Harrison Ford to Tom Cruise to Arnold Schwarzenegger , each featured in diverse stories that the author has on offer , and most from short stories too . But what about the combination of Lee Tamahori and Nicolas Cage ? Disaster . I've not read the short on which Next is based , but this movie failed Basic Storytelling 101 . It sets up pre-determined rules , and goes ahead to break them all , while trying to be too smart about it , and they say pride comes before a fall - didn't any crew notice those huge warning signs ? And it's not about the illogicality of time travel nor its associated paradoxes either . It's pure laziness in development , an obsessed focus in its mediocre action sequences , and without a clue in knowing how to end a story . Nicolas Cage plays Cris Johnson with Tom Hank's haircut from The Da Vinci Code . Johnson is a Las Vegas illusionist who's successful in his job because of his curse in being able to see things before they happen . Well , just anything two minutes ahead , and only if it directly involves himself . The only time that this rule doesn't seem to hold , is that he frequently daydreams about Liz ( Jessica Biel ) , with whom he thinks he shares a mysterious connection with . The FBI is unto some terrorists who have placed a nuclear device in California , and one of its agents Callie Ferris ( Julianne Moore ) is after Johnson to seek his abilities to help them , while the baddies are after everyone else , in one of lamest reasons ever - since the FBI wants Johnson , let's waste time finishing him off . While there were tons of promise in the movie with a premise like that , you get frequently irritated when Tamahori playbacks scenes on repeat , pulling that sleight of hand that says , OK , that's what's happening in Johnson's mind , you'll following his 2-min peek into the future , and we go back again . But the 2 minutes seem to go onto 3 , 4 , 5 minutes , until the ultimate sleight of hand pulled and played too far back , it's plain ludicrous . It's fine and dandy for a while , until its self fulfilling prophecy . No doubt it tries to redeem itself by playing on a paradox - that things change when you look ahead ( and alter a particular course of action ) , but as I've already mentioned , it's lazy . And the special effects were lazy too , with nothing done that an audience have never seen before , and to make things worse , some looked horribly fake . There's also an action routine going to make its staple this year ( the other one noted was in the Die Hard 4 . 0 trailer ) , and that's the " ducking from a mid-air flying car " routine . The rest looked like the Matrix's " bullet time / dodge while the bullets are flying at you / look mom I can split myself " effects , which wears on after a while . Cage sleepwalks through the role , no doubt assisted by a world weary character , while Jessica Biel is totally wasted in a role that could have been played by any Playboy Playmate of the Year , and that's just to put her twin peaks forward on screen . Julianne Moore seemed to have reminisce her time playing FBI agent Clarice Starling from Hannibal , and you would have expect Hannibal Lecter himself to make an appearance and start eating everyone else - now that would make a better movie . Next has my vote as one of the worst movie of the year for pulling that kinda rug from underneath your feet . It's title says it all , don't waste your time on this . Next !
A Nutshell Review : The Sinking of Japan	This disaster flick is a remake of a 1973 movie of the same title , based on a novel by Sakyo Komatsu . Japan is located right alongside the Pacific Ring of Fire ( active volcanoes ) and also along the edges of plate tectonics , whose shifting will cause earthquakes and tsunamis ( a Japanese term in itself for tidal wave ) . Naturally , this makes a natural premise for a disaster picture , what with Hollywood having a field day with films like Armageddon , Deep Impact , and more recently , The Day After Tomorrow , which tackles how global warming becomes the catalyst for natural disasters gone bonkers around the world . But I'll have to say this : The Sinking of Japan makes all the films mentioned earlier , look like classics . This disaster movie IS a disaster , and a massive one at that . Having to look at my watch every 10-15 minutes is a signal that the movie doesn't engage , and feels than it had over-clocked its runtime . The special effects are gorgeous to look at . From satellite styled outer space pictures , to the vivid recreation of every conceivable natural disaster that can strike the land of the rising sun , the effects are the star of the show . However , having spectacular computer generated graphics does not in itself make a movie palatable , as too much of a good thing just plain bores . If you had seen the trailer where you're enticed by the effects and specific scenes of chaos and mayhem , then yes , in fact those scenes are just that . There are no details , and everything is seen from afar , in a God-like mode . Things happen just like that on screen , with nary an attempt to try and delve deeper to look at issues up close . It's akin to Godzilla knocking over buildings , and it's as if there are no humans or loss of lives through that single act . Morbid as it might sound , show us the victims ! A populous nation like Japan doesn't just suffer disaster after disaster with an extremely low fatality count , not when the filmmakers unleash mayhem in such an epic scale . Trying to weave a romance into the movie , it stood out like a sore thumb . There are many characters in the movie , but each one of them lacking real characteristics , or humanity , and look like wandering zombies , without expression , without emotion , and definitely very stiff and unconvincing . Heroes become stuck in generic control rooms issuing statements , instructions and form policies , and react to incidents like it was a computer game , all settled with a push of a button . These are characters that you don't give a hoot about . If I may just use The Day After Tomorrow as a comparison , while there are terrific effects , there is at least an attempt to provide a microscopic view of the entire disaster from different individual's point of views . And infused within are plenty of action sequences , big ones like the disasters themselves , and small ones with the focus on the triumph of the human spirit , that makes it relatively compelling . Unfortunately for The Sinking of Japan , this movie should preferably be one to sink and tank , and hopefully undergo a short and quick death at the local box office to make way for better stuff .
A Nutshell Review : The Haunting of Molly Hartley	I guess all teenage starlets have to go through their cinematic rites of passage by having some horror flick under their belt . So far I've seen every film on the big screen that Haley Bannett had starred in , from her breakthrough role as the uber-sexy Cora " Buddha's Delight " Corman in Music and Lyrics , to Kendall of College , and now , the titular character in this horror film . Save for her debut , everything else had been of dubious quality , and I'm afraid without another hit soon , she'll more than be forgotten and should concentrate on her singing career instead . The film begins in some spooky woods in the 70s where a girl , on the cusp of her 18th birthday , begins to hear voices swirling around , and eventually got deliberately killed by her father . We don't know why , because we're suddenly transported to today , and to the bedroom of Molly Hartley , who is starting life afresh with her father ( Jake Weber ) in a new town . The focus is then shifted to high school pangs , of having to deal with new rivals , new potential love interest Joseph ( Chace Crawford ) , and new friends such as the rebel Leah ( Shannon Marie Woodward ) and Bible-thumper Alexis ( Shanna Collins ) . And because of a near fatal accident involving her mother , Molly's got regular shrink schedules with the school resident councillor Dr . Emerson ( Nina Siemaszko ) , where doubts are planted in the audience mind that Molly's not who she really seemed , having strange habits of going to the toilet to hyperventilate , or hearing voices of unknown folks again swirling around her , or experience hallucinations which provide for plenty of cheap scare tactics . Scenes like these were repeated ad-nauseam . But they are nothing frightening , because the movie has an entire look and feel of High School Musical , save the characters don't break out into song and dance . A little bit of positivity about the film is that there was an air of mystery about it , having this cool scream queen who doesn't know what her destiny is , always possessing this edgy feel to her character that there's more than meets they eye , holding you in some suspense . Coupled with the strange and slow revelation on what happened between Molly and her mom , it leaves you guessing for the most part . Until it decided to play it fast , and here's where the loopholes all start to appear really dumb in this hurried mode to finish the story off . You laugh as it went from scene to scene and not made much sense , and the worst part of it all was how it leapt into some bubblegum pop type of film , betraying all instances of sane thriller development into something that could have been the Wow factor when revealed , instead of the Duh factor . In doing what it did , it showed the filmmakers had lack of flair and skill , making some very strange decisions to have the story take on this flaccid psycho-babble route , and lacking any compelling characters to feel for . Heck , there's not even a decent body count too . The Haunting of Molly Hartley had an idea , but alas the translation of this idea into a feature film , with eye candy looking cast and all , failed miserably . Save your money , and fans of Haley Bennett would be better off watching her ( non ) performance on rented DVD instead .
A Nutshell Review : I Don't Want to Sleep Alone	I don't want to sleep alone - if you have incredible patience , then you probably won't have to . Otherwise , within 10 minutes , you'll fall into deep sleep , as did somebody in the same screening I went to . I have put off writing the review to see if my opinion would change , and I dare say it has mellowed down . I would have loved to condemn this Tsai Ming-Liang movie , but just like any other movie , its bound to have its lovers and detractors . I for one , disliked the film , but acknowledge its technical merits . Simply put , the movie tells 2 stories , one involving a man ( played by Tsai's muse Lee Kang - Sheng ) being attacked by gangsters , and taken in and cared for by a construction worker ( Norman Atun ) , while the other story involves a comatose man ( also starring Lee ) being nursed by Chyi ( Chen Shiang-Chyi ) , a coffeeshop waitress working for Pearlly Chua's sexually repressed coffeeshop owner . In classic Tsai style , these stories are told in long , static shots , little or no dialogue , and through songs . The usual themes of alienation , repression , loneliness etc ( fill in the blanks , you know the themes already ) is commonplace in the movie , so much so that they become turn offs . At times you wonder if it's a comedy of absurdity , and if the movie is a waste of film and resources . You also scratch your head wondering if those who have praised the movie sky high are out of their minds , or if they're following the bandwagon and praising the emperor's new clothes . However , I did enjoy the first few minutes of the movie when Lee's wandering man walked around the seedier streets of KL . In fact , there isn't really much clues that it's KL , it can be Geylang for all you care . And possibly every dark corner and roadside become commonplace as the narrative moves along . If anything , Tsai is an inspiration , for his minimalist art form that makes as if almost anyone could pick up a camera , gather some actors ( or friends with zero facial expression - you can mask them , or film from across the road so there are no close up shots to betray their lack of ability ) around , and make something out of nothing . Just as how crazy men are called eccentric rather than mad if they have power and money , you'll just have to convince that you're an auteur with an amazing eye for details , instead of being called a crap filmmaker if you try and emulate his style . To some it's pretentious , to others it's a contemporary classic in the works . The only way to best judge if you would like the movie , is to watch it yourself . Just be warned that you'll either be enamoured by it , or come out swearing every vulgarity you've ever known . I sure heard many colourful words when the mattress started to float . If compared to his previous work The Wayward Cloud , I'd find that a masterpiece . But then again , I've always liked my movies with song , dance , things that move , not just a reluctant handjob . Will I watch future Tsai's works ? Sure , if only as a test of true patience , for film school lessons and references , and to share in the perverse joy of listening out for newbies to Tsai movies as they exercise their freedom of colourful speech . They are a vocal bunch after all . Recommended only for hard core Tsai fans , and no one else .
A Nutshell Review : The Ten Commandments	I suppose Biblical stories will never run out of fashion , though I find it a bit strange that amongst the numerous potential stories for retelling , the story of Moses got chosen again , and for an animated movie no less , although this one's done in 3D . Remember Prince of Egypt ? Dreamworks Animation pretty much nailed it , especially when you have a relatively successful hit song as a byproduct ( played ad nauseam until it became an irritant ) . Comparisons are inevitable given the content and the form , and unfortunately , this movie with input from IVL Animation ( Singapore ) didn't surpass the benchmark set by Prince of Egypt , but it's a slight improvement to the local 3D animated movies that have been released to date ( that of Zodiac : The Race Begins and Tales of the Sea ) . The Ten Commandments that this version offered is a super summary of events that are in the Bible , starting from an infant Moses in a basket surviving a water borne trip , and bypassing his growing up years creatively through the opening credits . If using Cecil B . DeMille's 1956 movie starring Charlton Heston as the baseline , then it managed to shear off more than 50 % of that content , and added just a little bit more toward the last act , which seemed to drag it just a tad longer , including events that you may or may not already be familiar with , but definitely not in the DeMille film , nor in Prince of Egypt . As an animated movie , and a 3D one at that , it still has not reached the level of quality that one is accustomed to from , say Pixar , which in my opinion deem worthy to be used to measure up against . The animation here is still blocky at certain bits , especially in character design and rendering . But credit has to be given for how key scenes were depicted , and I thought the Burning Bush was particularly well done . Other than that , the Parting of the Red Sea was another key moment , but unfortunately didn't offer any spectacular Wow moment that the earlier Ten Commandment movies provided . It pales compared to the 2D style in Prince of Egypt , though it included a nod towards it of sorts by having those whales ( ? ) swimming around and seen through the water curtain . The movie managed to snag a more international cast for its voicing of characters , and I thought having Christian Slater ( Moses ) , Alfred Molina ( Ramses ) and Elliot Gould as the Voice of God , was a marked leap forward in helping the movie gain more attention , compared to the use of local actors ( no disrespect of course ) who may not have as much international clout to make the film appealing to audiences outside our borders . This movie will most likely appeal to Sunday School groups , given that it's relatively free of scary images , but yet managing to tell the story of various plagues descending onto Egypt .
A Nutshell Review : Drona	Abhishek Bachchan and Priyanka Chopra in a sword and sorcery movie from Bollywood ? That's certainly something different for me , and having two leading stars in this movie definitely provided that additional boost to pick up the DVD for closer scrutiny . Alas for a fantasy film , there's nothing groundbreaking in its special effects , action sequences or story , and if some kind of benchmark was to be set , then this would likely be at the level of Krull , and even then , Krull had a more coherent and intriguing premises than Drona . In Goldie Behl's creation , Drona refers to the long lineage of kings entrusted to protect the Nectar of Immortality , which demigods of the universe had decided to hide on Earth , under the constant eye of their chosen protector . Adit ( Abhishek Bachchan ) is the latest descendant of Dronas , but is unaware of his innate ability as protector of the world . In what seemed to be some vast similarities to Harry Potter , he lives with mean relatives and becomes a punching bag for their bullying , until he's awakened by his protector of sorts , the woman-warrior Sonia ( Priyanka Chopra ) . So it becomes a discovery of his lineage , abilities and destiny , but this development plods along so slowly , coupled with Bachchan's constant brooding as Drona , that it makes it really infuriating to follow , and not to mention countless of over-dramatic moments each time he discovers a little something about himself or his abilities , or even his wardrobe , sword and trusty super steed . And in order to push this Drona into action , it had taken the villainous wizard Riz Raizada ( Kay Kay Menon ) a diabolical scheme to freeze Drona's mom ( Jaya Bachchan ) into suspended animation , and thereafter some really convenient plot development that allows the audience to follow Drona around in a rescue mission of sorts . Drona's abilities actually don't come off as well-defined , and you would've wondered at the amazing ability of his to fight off his opponents through various wire-fu moves . Battle sequences on the whole were rather lacklustre , and the big train action sequence came off as rather clunky and clumsy , and strictly meant for the kids . Costumes were rather average , and I thought Priyanka had to endure some really ridiculous outfits that tried too hard to make her look sexy yet fearsome as a warrior . The rare saving graces in the film were the numerous graphical and animated stills that get juxtaposed with the live action scenes . Those were really gorgeous to gawk at , together with some of the really ambitious special effects used to jazz up scenes , but a pity that the same can't be said of the film proper . And of course , Kay Kay Menon seemed to have a field day with a villain with a penchant for monologues through puppetry , and the creation of countless of clones to do his evil bidding and fight battles on his behalf . For a villain he had some of the best moments in being always one step ahead of the hero , until of course the decisive moment in the finale which was a real disappointment . No doubt Drona tried hard to be a one of a kind film in a genre seldom seen from Bollywood , but it contains more misses than hits , and lacked that fundamental quality that it's always about the story first , then special effects and action second . But as they say , the only way to go from here for this genre in Bollywood , is up . Watch only if you have some children to entertain .
A Nutshell Review : Love Songs	In the running for the Palme d'Or in last year's Cannes Film Festival , Love Songs by Christophe Honore was nothing like what the writeup used in the festival synopsis would have let you believe . Either that , or I'm really dense to have trusted what was essentially a verbatim recap of only the first of three segments that this movie was split into ? Departure , Absence and Return . Rather than dwell on the non-existent and off screen manège-a-trios , it's more of a tale of grief and the handling of grief after personal tragedy . It seemed like an exploration of venturing into the extremes , of being experimental for the sheer thrill of it , of trying to lead a vastly different lifestyle in other to drown all memories of the deceased , of numbing oneself in excessive , meaningless sex . I would have welcomed the viewpoints of family members in depth , as the movie did spend some time to set up those characters , only to have relegated them with sideshow treatment , nothing more than caricatures from parents who try to engage their child's friends in order to discover hidden secrets unknown to them , to siblings who hang around trying to come to grips with the loss , only to find some questionable , eyebrow raising antics leading to assumptions and quick conclusions . As a musical , the songs did feel a little out of place when the characters start to break into them , and seriously , I thought the lyrics could have been lost in translation , as sometimes I could not see how they either move the narrative forward , or speak from the heart the innermost thoughts from the characters mouthing those words . At some points it really felt a little bit forced , and have left one wondering about the relevance of those phrases sung , so while the meaning have probably been lost in me , it might be of relevance to French speakers . While the movie stars Louis Garrel , Ludivine Sagnier and Clotilde Hesme , the bulk of the screen time belonged to Garrel's Ismael . The threesome relationship between their characters weren't exactly explained , only that they are strange bedfellows sharing their nights together . While Sagnier's Julie did reveal her uneasiness at such an arrangement , Hesme's Alice already knows of the boundaries within their relationships that she cannot cross , and as they toy around those forbidden lines , any sense of angst and unhappiness get sung away quite fleetingly . In short , it's a film that lacked some crucial emotional punch , preferring to just scratch the surface and try to get away with it . Definitely trying to appeal to the niche crowd with its dalliances with hetero / lesbian / gay themes , but ultimately , came across as very forced and pretentious , trying to hammer a square peg into a round hole , if you can pardon the pun . Disappointing stuff .
A Nutshell Review : Hit-man	10 years ago , Philip Noyce directed a movie that was based on an adapted character . He put this character in Russia , and got him embroiled in some political intrigue that's way over his head and should not have involved him in the first place . Naturally , our anti-hero ( he's a professional thief by the way ) bites back , using skills he honed to perfection , and basically relying on his smarts to escape near misses . His charisma ensured he had a beauty with brains tagging along , albeit reluctantly but given no choice with her involvement in the scheme of things , before forging trust , and possible romance . His name ? Simon Templar , aka The Saint . Today , we have Xavier Gens taking a character , Agent 47 ( Timothy Olyphant ) based on an EDIOS game called The Hit-man , and scribe Skip Woods ' story has this best of the best ( they always have to be ) in St Petersburg to do what he does , and that's to carry out professional hit jobs at the direction of The Agency ( are you quivering now ? ) . He gets embroiled in a political conspiracy given his mark is a certain political figure , and has the Russian military , his own organization and Interpol ( led by Dougray Scott's Mike Whittier ) after his hide . Along the way , he saves Nika Boronina ( Olga Kurylenko ) a Russian call girl / sex slave from certain death , and in between finds himself in a very difficult romance . Notice the similarities ? It's The Saint all over again , except this time , Agent 47 resembles more of Jason Bourne , but without the hair , replaced by shiny baldness with a cartoony barcode tattooed at the back . He has a penchant for suits and trenchcoats , but only to hide his mean knives when he chooses to engage in more dignified battles . So unlike the suave Simon Templar , he opts for the obvious , and should have taken a leaf or two in styling and disguises from Templar , rather than walking around being the odd one out of a sea of hairy heads and a barcode that says " Hello World " . Anyway that's the character design from the game , so we can't complain about it can we , just as how Angelina Jolie had to have her ample assets enhanced to match Lara Croft's . But its similarity to Jason Bourne cannot be denied , in the way that both are professional assassins , and probably schooled in the same close quartered unarmed combat techniques , and the similarity even went down to how these action sequences were shot and edited - quick cuts , jerky hand held style . It's action set pieces turned out to be rather ordinary , probably because they are rehashes of some classical scenes that we've seen before in other movies . Like the shoot em up with machine guns , the shattering of pillars and plenty of blow em ups with a rock soundtrack blaring in the background that we've seen in the Matrix movies . Or how about " paying homage " to Hong Kong movies like Johnny To's Mexican standoffs in recent flicks like Mad Detective and Exiled , but done with less pizazz and the proceedings and outcome bordering on the ridiculous . Or how about close quartered fisticuffs done while crouching under a platform , ala Jet Li's Fong Sai-Yuk ? And how about a Saw's Jigsaw inspired moment to boot ? But truly the scene which took the cake , was one done in extremely bad taste . In referencing the tragic terrorist event in Russia where government forces used gas to literally put friend and foe to sleep before they stormed a theatre , this gets repeated here with cruel aplomb , and I thought it was quite insensitive of the filmmakers to do so , in the manner in which they did so . If you can put aside all these misgivings , then you'll probably find something remotely to enjoy with Hit-man . Agent 47 is bald Bourne , but he's not amnesiac , and having been brought up in an all male monastery , it wrecks havoc on his non-existent sex life , especially when Nika hits on him time and again , sans clothes . There are many sub plots and unnecessary scenes in this movie , but they remained so that this wouldn't turn out to be a short film , or feel part of the video game where you have absolutely no control over . Timothy Olyphant did a rather decent job as Agent 47 as the role calls for little emotion ( i . e . nothing to do except alternating between cool and mean ) with stuntmen making him look good . In fact , most characters were pretty one-dimensional , and Nika the call girl would have been every fan / geek boy's wet dream come true . If I should praise anything , then it should be the way villains are dispatched without the bullshit lapsing into monologues . Video game movies rarely are hits , and while Agent 47 never misses a target , I would classify this one under a huge misfire . The story's ho-hum , the action very familiar and mediocre with a lacklustre effort all around . And I'm sure to walk out next time if the male lead tells the hot chick " don't worry about finding me , I'll find you , no matter where in the world you can be " . Yeah right .
A Nutshell Review : LOV	After the phenomenal box office success of Cape No . 7 , it sure didn't take long for leads Van Fan and Tanaka Chie to be starring in the same movie again , albeit not exactly opposite each other , because L-O-V-E . is an anthology of four short films by directors Chen Yi-xian , Vincent Fang , Huang Tzi-chiao , and Jiu Ba Dao , who each were at the helm of their own stories , delivering their own brand of what it means to be in love . It's perhaps a no-brainer at who the target audience is for this film , having to stuff all the stories with great looking leads , and stories ranging from the saccharine sweet to the brooding and longing , each being tuned to appeal to a spectrum of the audience lured in via the eye candy . If I may I'll break it down for you : The first story takes a huge leaf out of P . S . I Love You in the setting of its premise . It offers a non-linear narrative to tell a love story with leads Van Fan and Megan Lai , a couple who celebrates their 7th anniversary together by . . . having a lightsabre fight . And the perennial terminal illness has to kick in , thereby setting this film up for the tried and tested , and very much like going through an episode of some chicken soup for the soul . The second was something straight out of a Taiwan melodramatic television serial , which actually started off really well with its theme on memories and how they become treasure when shared between two lovers . Put together a singer-photographer ( Lens ) , a gorgeous and out of place looking museum curator ( Annie Liu ) with a knack for all things old , a hotshot director ( Blue Lan ) who flares easily when the curator and the singer get intimate in a shooting of a music video . It's a melting pot for emotions to grow into a love triangle , until the very expected twist in the end comes charging in . Convenience here is the key . Somehow I liked the third one best , even if it really tested one's patience with its relatively long takes of silence . It's about forgiveness , and what matters most , and we see a couple not exactly on talking terms , parting with some animosity after failure to resolve their issues . You can say the pride of a man would sometimes get us into such unnecessary trouble as we hear how his heart echos what he really feels like doing , but without the physical will to swallow his ego . It's draped with plenty of brooding qualities , before building up to an emotionally charged finale , again relying on clichés like the big chase against time to seal everything up with a kiss . Stars Ethan Ruan and Alice Tzeng . The last film is easily the crowd favourite , judging from the audience's enthusiastic response to the multiple cameo appearances of their teen idols . From Alec Su to Chen Bo-lin and a slew of effeminate looking pop idols ( yeah , I can hear the flak I'm getting already ) , it allowed for plenty of physical comedy with a nerdy looking Tracy Chou playing a desperate woman out looking for her true love , relying on some cheesy self-help video to tell her love fortune , as she rejects one after another on her quest set out for her . You'll probably be laughing along and at the way this film gets constructed , as it brings back some memories of Hong Kong's " mo-lei-tau " ( nonsensical ) era . The earlier films had plenty of narration going on for them , that they looked at ease with a typical Wong Kar Wai movie if put side by side . However , the 4th film is so vastly different that it actually sticks out like a sore thumb , though it was one that was the most fun because of its zaniness , and its deliberateness in hamming everything up just for laughs . Suffice to say this is also the crowd's favourite , especially after the melancholic third film . L-O-V-E . is simply a short film collection of some of the hottest teen idol stars from contemporary Taiwan . If the filmmakers could've found more peers and distilled their shorts to just their essence , they could've come up with the Taiwanese version of Paris Je Taime . Unfortunately the stories didn't veer from the tried and tested models , and preferred to just coast along plainly , resulting in just an average show on the greatest emotion in which we call love .
A Nutshell Review : Joshua	There are kids who are adorable , and kids who just gets on your nerve . Joshua gets filed under the latter , with a creepy look to boot . No offense to child actor Jacob Kogan who gets the titular role , but when he's brooding with that psychotic glint in the eye , you just want to throw him into a cage and toss the key out of the window . But this demonic kid pales in comparison to The Omen's Damien , although both will score high marks for their diabolical scheming mind . The latter is the devil incarnate , but Joshua turns out to be your atypical child who feels threatened by the coming of a new born sibling . You know , the jealous rage that permeates as they perceive the lack of attention and love bestowed upon them . Dad Brad Cairn ( Sam Rockwell ) used to be his best buddy , but Joshua feels that his own lack of athleticism might be that barrier between them , and given his personal preference for the arts like the fondness for dark musical pieces on his piano . Mom Abby ( Vera Farmiga ) on the other hand , turns out to be a nervous wreck , which works to Joshua's advantage in pushing the right buttons . It's revenge of the neglected kid basically . The movie tried to be creepy with the employment of usual shock tactics seen in most horror movies , and they do feel a little out of place here , especially when it tries to position itself as a psychological thriller . It's nothing very cerebral about it , and for the most parts , its extremely slow pace brings about a sense of frustration , especially when plot loopholes , or irrational character behaviour that you'd come not to expect , gets so blatantly glossed over , thinking that audiences are idiots . You can't help but to feel that the story development was too contrived as incidents happen too conveniently , with nary any actual resolution except toward the inevitable ending . There's nothing chilling about it , except that you now realize that smart kids do become a nightmare when they put their noodle to the test of outwitting , outplaying and outlasting their parents . Perhaps the only saving grace here is Sam Rockwell's performance as the dad who's trying to figure everything out , and at the same time protecting the new offspring from the clutches of her now demented brother . But seriously , all Joshua requires is a good long drawn spanking from the slipper , out of the public view of course .
A Nutshell Review : Open Season	OK , this year alone probably saw a record number of talking animal animations , with countless of punchlines filled with pop culture references , and big name stars attached to the projects , that it's about time we give the genre a good break , rather than churning them out continuously with more misses than hits . And Open Season , probably the last one on offer this year from a Hollywood studio , suffers from this glut , unfortunately . Heck , with so much similarities between the movies , you can even spot a familiarity or two from the story lines , taking a a leaf from one of the earlier flop - The Wild , in having one of its stars here , part of a popular animal attraction , and another part from Over The Hedge , where a group of animals must band together for survival and a fight against adversity . The leads for Open Season are a domesticated grizzly bear who has its own teddy bear soft toy ( don't ask ) , and a mule-deer with one half of its horn sawn off . An unlikely pairing , a " loser and a loserer " , voiced by Martin Lawrence and Ashton Kutcher respectively . It's strange that there's a reversal of voice roles here , as Lawrence's Boog the Bear is uptight , while Kutcher's Elliot the deer is built in the same old wise cracking mould as Eddie Murphy's Mushu in Mulan , or Donkey in Shrek . In other words , Boog frequently gets punk'd by Elliot . It's one of those recycled plots about loneliness , and having two misfits finding themselves in each other , relying on strengths from the other party in order to survive in new environments . A misadventure sees Boog go back to the wild , with Elliot in tow , and the two have to find a way to get back to civilization where Boog belongs . Along the way they encounter other critters in the woods of course , paving the way for some comedy and more recycled themes of bullies and the likes . Don't believe the trailers though , as the war between animals and humans , doesn't take up much screen time . The sad part though , is that there aren't many funny moments to distract you from the rehashed story lines and subplots , but then again , it's a made for children movie . As always , there are some of the weaker characters which get used as punching bags , and here , this role belonged to the mindless rabbits , which some might find irritatingly adorable . My vote however goes to the nasty Irish-accented squirrels , defenders of their pine trees with their nuts , and in second place , those insane beavers . At least the animals don't break out singing songs every now and then , though there are some nice musical numbers that went along with the movie . But all in all , this movie isn't as entertaining as , say , Over The Hedge , and neither is it as bad as The Wild . But don't say I didn't warn you if you find this a tad too boring . Wait for the DVD , and rent it . Oei !
A Nutshell Review : The Absent	This is the latest in a slew of Euro movies to make it to our shores here , promoted as a mystery thriller because of the faux-pas sense of sophistication from everything European . To its credit , it does keep you guessing . As the premise goes , a serene family of four moves into the suburbs , only for Julia ( Ariadna Gil ) the mom experiencing things that go bump , even in the day . Loving husband Samuel ( Jordi Molla ) and kids Felix ( Nacho Perez ) and Luis ( Omar Munoz ) do not experience these strange phenomenon , and therefore this leads to tension within the family . What works is the atmosphere built up , that there are many scenes filled with plenty of emptiness Julia experiences in the neighbourhood , and the bewilderment she felt when she slowly discovers that there is no one else to turn to , not even her husband and children . Feeling extremely isolated , she begins to wonder what happened to have brought about the changes to her surroundings , as well as her family . On one hand , you want to sympathize with Julia and her increasing exasperation , and Ariadna Gil's performance enables you to do so . However , it's really a case of more than meets the eye , and you might be increasing as frustrated as the character when you attempt to figure out what is happening as well - is it a psycho babble mystery , or something involving the supernatural , or a conspiracy of sorts ? You can warrant a guess , and you'll probably be right , but the way the film progresses and develops , doubts will be cast on your assumptions , right until the very last scenes . If compared to earlier fare like Lemming ( happy family in suburbs ) and Cache / Hidden ( something remotely similar with its CCTV cameras and discovery that you can watch them on TV ) , The Absent probably is the weakest in terms of storyline , and the least entertaining of the lot . If you're thinking you're up for something quite cerebral , you might end up disappointed .
A Nutshell Review : Bloody Tie	Bloody Tie was my last movie for this year's Singapore International Film Festival , and although it's an action movie , I thought it ended my festival this year with a whimper rather than with a bang . Set in the time of the IMF ( not the Mission Impossible one ) making loans to a South Korean economic collapse , the populace begins to turn to drugs for their bit of escapism . The worst hit city with plenty of drug addicts happen to be Busan , and for drug dealer Sangdo , this presents opportunity to make it to the big league . On the other side of the law , narcotics police detective Lieutenant Do , known for his unorthodox and violent prone techniques , takes Sangdo under his wing as his informal snitch . But as all things go , it's a black eat black world , with cop and drug dealer striking up an uneasy partnership , each with their own agenda to leach on the other for their own selfish reasons , in their common quest to take down the new and current drug lord . Sounds like good stuff ? That's what I thought too , until the pacing switched me off for the most parts . It's full of verbal bravado , and plenty of supporting characters adding absolutely nothing to further the story . Its runtime of almost 2 hours was not justified , and some sections could have been cut short to quicken things up . One of the few saving graces is its black humour , but other than that , it's pretty serious and sombre . If you're interested , stay tuned until the end of the credits . But given the late night , the projectionist was too trigger happy to shut the projector off halfway through the scene . Pity .
A Nutshell Review : Ghost Game	The premise seemed interesting enough - a group of game contestants undertaking the ultimate dare , to rough it out in a prison renowned for its haunting given that it was the location of a massacre . The news film reel style at the beginning , without showing much gore , already set the atmosphere and mood , providing much anticipated scares for our 11 contestants . Again I'm sad to say that this horror flick didn't work for me . It seemed like a bit of Battle Royale meeting Truman Show mixed with Survivor elements . While Battle Royale had a group of students sent to an island for them to whack the living daylights out of each other , in this one our motley crew had to rely more on psychology to outplay , outwit and outlast each other , as well as the supernatural elements . There's something in common though , in that they had ex-winners re-enter the competition . There're plenty of CCTV cameras and public announcement speakers installed throughout where instructions are yelled through , and images are recorded for public broadcast in the show Ghost Game . Like Survivor , there were plenty of decisions made in the spirit of that game , together with familiar elements of alliances and mistrust , of second guessing good intentions and making wild conjectures , all in the name of playing the game and emerging the winner for that pot of gold at the end of the rainbow . Which actually left the scares wanting . Unfortunately we had to fall back on the usual lame quick cuts , sudden camera zooms , and extreme close ups accompanied by loud beats to race heartbeats . It might even leave you wondering about that aged old saying , that only if you're unlucky , could you see spirits wandering around you . Here , sightings aren't consistent if that aged old saying is to be believed , and that could be a bit frustrating . Setting the game to coincide with the anniversary of the massacre seemed like common sense for television ratings , As a side , the eleven contestants here are actually from a variety show called Academy Fantasia in Thailand , and in similar fashion , they get " voted off " here too . The gem however turned out to be the scene played during the end credits , where the contestants come out to say a few words prior to being sent to the game location . Plenty of cheese as they ham it up in character , and watching it in hindsight , you can't help but to feel a tinge of despair . P . S . I've read that the filmmakers had to apologize given the premise of the prison seemed to have cut too close to the Cambodian's Toul Sieng prison during the Khmer Rouge regime , with the depiction of genocide , and the loose reference in the movie in the form of a game show .
A Nutshell Review : Aa Dekhen Zara	Jumping from great heights and into a swimming pool is firmly a cliché in my books . Hollywood overuses it , and I see that influence has crossed borders as well . Need an escape when your character is cornered ? Well , leaping off a building automatically means a body of water deep enough to cushion impact down below . There's nothing more lazy than that nowadays , so thumbs down to any story that offers this quick fix , like a " Goto " statement in a program , rather than opting for a more elegant programming structure . It's a little bit surprising that Aa Dekhen Zara clocks in less than 120 minutes , with intermission . Not that all Bollywood movies are supposed to be at least 150 minutes long of course , but you can feel that director Jehangir Surti has not grasped the need to tell more in less time , and as such the characters suffer in being nothing more than cardboard caricatures . Sub plots tangent off one another that they felt half-baked , and were introduced for the sake of , rather than for a purpose and a need . Not that it was narratively bad , but the story suffered from the lack of time . And time plays a key role in this science fictioner . Neil Nitin Mukesh plays Ray Acharya , a freelance photographer with mounting debt and no assignments . His grandfather is a great scientist , and when he passed away , Ray inherits an old camera which turns out to be more than meets the eye . Of course I'm not going to reveal what it does here , which the movie does in a montage one step being behind the audience who would already have figured out by then , but suffice to say that with great power comes great responsibility , and big trouble as well , as a given . For what it's worth , it delves into the greed of man . With power comes the ability to satisfy the lust after money . You can bet your last dollar that everyone when thrusted with a new power , will try to see if it can be monetized . And if it can , then you're likely to milk it for its worth . And when it comes to money , it's typically all men for themselves , with everyone wanting a piece of the pie , stopping at nothing to try and get at it . If it's a golden goose that lays golden eggs , then there will be neighbours eyeing that fowl of yours . Villains though are extremely one dimension . Having the story shifted to Thailand in the later half of the film , there seemed to be no qualms in highlighting the corruption of the police as either informers , or greedy bastards , that seem to plague both countries . Bipasha Basu delivers more spunk than the male lead Neil Nitin Mukesh here , and it's no surprise since the veteran has more mileage in action flicks under her belt . Her role as a DJ turned aspiring singer here I felt was little more than to allow the usual song-and-dance routine to come up . While that set in a club was natural , there was one awfully artificial routine in Thailand where Ray and Bipasha's Simi escape into an outlaw bar , and are forced to sing and dance for the Thai men just because they're expected to . Neil and Bipasha also looked very awkward with each other , sharing really no chemistry as lovebirds , but rather clicked when they're supposed to be estranged . It has a potentially interesting premise and plot device set up , but alas the story's yet another bland action flick with little suspense as you're likely to stay one step ahead each time . If only it had a better story , but perhaps that was left to a sequel ( which Aa Dekhen Zara lead into ) which will probably not be made since this film would have tanked that prospect .
A Nutshell Review : Zabriskie Point	I've got to admit I continue to be perplexed at the films of Michelangelo Antonioni , having the counter now reach 2 . Perhaps it's due to my limited knowledge of the vast issues during the 1960s counter-culture era , and probably count The Graduate as one of the movies set during the time that stuck vividly on my Teflon coated memory . Between Blow Up and Zabriskie Point , I thought I saw a style continue in having scenes come up in a rather haphazard manner without any seeming logic to connect one to the other . We're presented with something , and then we're left to our own devices to figure out and fill in the blanks . Just like how Daria ( Daria Halprin ) was introduced as a stand-in secretary wanting to access the rooftop of Sunny Dunes Development Company to retrieve a book left behind , before having to ask the approval of a manager . So , was there really a book , and did that chance meeting progress into anything more substantial ? I can only guess . Zabriskie Point began with a closed door debate on revolution , where geeky students were championing their various individual thoughts on what it means to be a revolutionary , some fighting with ideals , while others suggesting violence . It's a somewhat long scene where the camera adopts jarring motions as if you're caught right in the middle of the verbal crossfire , peering over heads and shoulders to look at ( and sometimes fail to see ) whoever's talking . The other protagonist , Mark ( Mark Frechette ) gets introduced toward the end of the discussion where he disagrees with the majority , and walks out . Throughout the first half of the movie we follow Mark as he evades the authorities , presented here as very heavy-handed , and daft too , and we see this very carefree rebel almost synonymously generalized with the impetuous youth of the time . Little is known of him at this stage besides watching him getting entangled in a protest riot ( which was quite documentary like ) that went awry . We assume that he is quite well to do since he obviously have taken lessons to fly a plane , and fly one expertly at low altitudes too . And then the ridiculous and the boring happened , which was an elaborate courtship ritual over land and air , and it's not since Tom Cruise tried to woo Thandie Newton in John Woo's MI : 2 using the crashing , twirling sports car technique that this goes into my books as quite laughable . I would have imagined that the story would pick up at this point where the two youths meet , but of course I was wrong . I am now starting to believe that if it's something that I would have come to expect , then an Antonioni film this would not be . One had been trying to look for direction to the next stage of her character , while the other was running away and wanted to be left alone in peace . Put them together and I wanted to see some sparks fly as they talk , flirt and get intimate . They do , but not without having the entire scene become far more surreal , with plenty of other bodies joining in a frolicking good time at the titular location . And from that point on , I felt the story went downhill , trying to find an avenue to make a last ditch attempt to salvage something out of nothing so far . Sure I can see the obvious references to the anti-war statements , or statements that are anti-establishment , but beyond that , try as hard as I can given my limited ability , I just can't figure out what else would have been coded in between the lines . Just when I thought there would be a story , the last act dragged out itself and no longer became engaging , save for what some would call the mother of all repeated explosions , making a blatant point across that consumerism , corporations , mass media ( and the list goes on ) can all go to hell . Sorry , but Fight Club deals with that theme in far more interesting ways than this one did . There are still redeeming qualities though , and that's the cinematic images that the movie contains , with plenty of generous shots of vast plains , as well as a view from the top looking down at relatively flat city skylines . And sadly , having read about one of the final shots which never seen the light of day , I thought it would've complemented perfectly the gaudy colours of a hastily and heavily graffiti-ed plane with striking pictures of the male appendage and 2 boobs on its wings , together with echoes of anti-war statements and of bombs . Needless to say I did not really enjoy Zabriskie Point , but curiously enough , there were some shades of local films Lucky 7 and Dreams From the Third World in it with its scenes in the flats and in what I thought looked like a cave with dripping water . I guess to continue to try and enjoy more of Antonioni's works and to prep myself , nothing can come sooner than a documentary about the man himself , to be screened tomorrow morning as part of the Retrospect .
A Nutshell Review : The OH in Ohio	The OH here refers to the female orgasm , and while some like to tout this as the female version of last year's hit comedy The 40-Year Old Virgin , I would beg to differ . Written and directed by Billy Kent , the only probably reason for the link between the two films is that both starred Paul Rudd , but of course , playing different characters . Appealing to obviously different groups , The Oh in Ohio , while it has its rib tickling moments , is nowhere as hilariously insane as The 40 Year Old Virgin . Parker Posey is no Steve Carrell , even though their characters have their lack of sex being something in common . Posey's character Priscilla Chase is one of the most gorgeous woman of her time , but unfortunately for her as she finds out , she had never had an orgasm , even though her husband , Jack ( Paul Rudd ) has one of the more impressive guns around town , as ascertained by his student Kristen ( Mischa Barton , from the OC ) . While Virgin had its focus trained on that one man who hasn't got laid , OH in Ohio sets its sights on how the Chase husband and wife settle their differences . To her , her frigidity was identified as a cause for her lack of the big-O , but for him , it's a different story altogether as it's a direct impact on his big fat male ego in being unable to satisfy his wife . From then on , the story tangents off in two separate directions , with Priscilla and her quest to cum , and Jack on his journey of self-assurance . Part of the fun here belonged to the expanded cast , like Heather Graham has the lesbian sex shop owner , and Liza Minnelli as a sex guru , in what could probably be one of the most hilarious scenes in the movie . Danny DeVito , I thought he uttered one line from Batman Returns , was probably the most underdeveloped character as Wayne the Pool Guy , though he played an important role as adviser and confidante . However , the rest are pretty much throw away characters . Mischa Barton's role too was nothing more than a cock-tease . To bring on more laughs , there were senseless scenes on the ( ove ) reliance on devices , sexual and otherwise , though that was counter-balanced with some pretty raunchy-witty dialogue . My only gripe is that The OH In Ohio ended in an anti-climax . Just as you thought the lead characters had built up and developed , and are expecting some fireworks between them , it ended off with quite a limp , leaving you just as unsatisfied as Priscilla was prior to her transformation .
A Nutshell Review : The Spiderwick Chronicles	I guess movies based on children's fantasy books are money spinners that are just too hard to be passed up . But for each Harry Potter and Bridge to Terabithia , there's Eragon and The Golden Compass . The latter two have ready literary installments , but their dismal box office result means they are unlikely to be made anytime soon . Which is probably why The Spiderwick Chronicles decided to combine multiple books into a palatable 100 minute movie that just gets to the point without unnecessary meandering . Based on the books by Holly Black and Tony Diterlizzi , the story centers on three children , twins Jared and Simon Grace ( a double dose of Freddie Highmore ) , and older sister Mallory Grace ( Sarah Bolger ) , who chance upon a whole new world as introduced in a secret book written by Arthur Spiderwick ( David Strathaim ) , albeit with a warning not to read it , lest they attract the attention of an evil ogre and its minions . Of course , being children , and the rebel amongst them - Jared , learns all that he can about the world of faeries and various miscellaneous thingamajigs that we don't get introduced to much at all . So it's a battle between the good children and the evil monsters as the latter try their best to steal Arthur's field guide , in order for world domination ( as always ) ! On the whole , as a children's movie , it works to entertain the kids . There were rounds of applause each time the children go one up against the enemies , who aren't really that bright and are easily defeated by tomato sauce ( yup , it's a children's movie alright ) . Some scenes reminded me of Home Alone though , where normal household items become weapon of choice against the enemies . There are the usual pathos built in with the usual parental - children break down in relationships , such as that between Jared and mom Helen ( Mary - Louise Parker ) , and the waiting for promises fulfilled between Lucinda ( Joan Plowright ) and dad Arthur Spiderwick . I'd bet if the filmmakers can insert reminders to listen to your parents , they would . The special effects don't really set to wow , and the creature designs also don't set out to astonish . They come across as fairly routine effort in crafting realism , but somehow lacked a distinct soul . Perhaps it's the lack of focus given to individual creatures that they don't come across as unique , or very lazily and hastily slapped together since they're usually moved around in groups . Action set pieces are somewhat below par , and involves lots of running , little physical contact between combatants , and not much tension building where you would root for or cheer for the heroes . Then again , this is an adult watching the movie , not a child , who would have a different opinion . Fans of Freddie Highmore would be delighted that he does get to stretch his acting chops a bit , although it's just acting through 2 characters on different ends of the spectrum . Filled with various supporting voices like Martin Short as Thimbletack the brownie , Seth Rogen as Hogsqueal hobgoblin and Nick Nolte as evil shape-shifting ogre Mulgarath , it's pretty much a standard action adventure suitable for the entire family with little violence and no gore , though to adults , it might be a little bore .
A Nutshell Review : The Dukes of Hazzard	Remakes are getting popular in Hollywood , be they adapted from existing Asian films like Infernal Affairs , or digging into their own nostalgic TV series . This remake doesn't take itself too seriously , as we revisit the Dukes of Hazzard County - Cousins Luke , Bo , Daisy and Uncle Jessie . In a short span of 10 minutes , we get introduced to the boys and their moonshine running , their penchant for running into trouble , the bickering banter , and got the opportunity to see Daisy up close and personal in the bar . The plot's a bit flimsy , nothing too intelligent - baddie Boss Hogg buys up farmland in Hazzard in an attempt to turn Hazzard into a humongous coal mining town , and it's up to the Duke boys to stop him from achieving his objective . It plays out simply like a chess game , with moves and countermoves from both sides , but no prizes for guessing who always come up tops . There are plenty of stars in this remake film . Johnny Knoxville , better known as the creator-writer of the TV series Jackass , stars as Luke Duke . Sean Williams Scott seems to be dangerously type-casted into smarty-pants or dumb jock roles , given his filmography filled with American Pies , and asking Where's his Car in Road Trips . Thankfully , there is some chemistry between them to make this film bearable . For any hot-blooded male , the female dormitory scene will probably bring on the laughs , Jessica Simpson has been aptly highlighted ( or rather , her assets were ) in the trailers , and as Daisy Duke , she gets to flaunt her assets a lot in this film , in various hot pants , bikinis and undress . It gets tired after a while , as Daisy Duke turned more into a bimbo than anything else . Not that I'm not enjoying every moment of it though . Willie Nelson completes the Duke family as Uncle Jessie , and you'd half expect him to break out into song , which he did , for a short while , during the end credits . The villains are over the top , with Burt Reynolds really adding the cheese as Hogg . But the real star of the show is that red hot " General Lee " Dodge Charger car which leaps over so many ramps placed throughout the movie on purpose . The Dixie horn gets tooted a number of times too , just for the sake of drumming it in that hey , it's like the TV series . The cinematography for General Lee challenges flicks like The Fast and The Furious , and even gives Initial D's " drifting " a run for its money , performing the drifting stunt not in lonely mountain roads , but in busy city streets . Hats off to the stunt drivers , and for wreaking quite a number of the cars as seen in the making of clips in the closing credits . The Dukes of Hazzard gamely captures some elements in the TV series , but the movie doesn't offer anything much refreshing . While enjoyable , there isn't much to take away from this comedy , and is forgettable once you're out of the theatre .
A Nutshell Review : Colic	Colic is the latest Thai horror movie to hit our shores , and given the gimmicky promotion in local theatres , where a cradle with that nasty picture of the baby inside , you'd start to wonder if this movie will actually give you the creeps , without resorting to the usual cheap gimmicks which plagued the slew of horror movies of late . By the look of that powerful palm imprint on the baby's body , you'd think that there are devilish ( pugilistic ) forces to be reckoned with in Colic . However , sorry to disappoint , things that start to go bump in the night , are as tame as a pussy cat exhibiting a hissy fit . While the movie scores in its dealing with the atmospherics , it had forgotten that an engaging story is king , nevermind how implausible ( ghost stories what ) the premises is . Colic actually has potential , in taking something that couldn't be very much explained in scientific terms , and adding a dash of the spiritual to it . But it turned out to be wasted potential instead . Newlyweds Pong ( Vittaya Wasukraipaisan ) and Phrae ( Pympan Chalayanacupt ) have an infant son who suffers from cholic - that incessant crying for reasons attributed to various factors unexplained in the movie , until the end , more or less . Should there be a hidden message in the movie , it'll probably be not to smoke when you're expecting , or that karma will work against you if you have pre-marital sex and have to undergo a shotgun wedding if not adequately protected . Anyway I digress . The happy family move to the suburbs , and there's where unexplained happenings start to occur to them . I must warn you that it takes a long time for the family to move , and for the first of such bumps in the night . In between bumps are uneventful stuff that seem to be put in as fillers , which made the entire narrative storyline very episodic , and extremely dragged out between scenes . The horror here has a familiar look and feel to it , kinda like old Hong Kong horror flicks . What the movie couldn't decide , and it shows in the film , is what to do with the inexplicable stuff . Do we want to deal with spirits , or ghouls , maybe poltergeists , or gore like Saw or Hostel . There are some truly intense moments though which will leave you at the edge of your seat , but when looking back at hindsight , they're pretty much a mixed bag and seem all over the place . It takes a long time for things to build , and during this time , it's pretty boring , as you literally observe an infant grow up , in quarterly stages . So long as you don't expect too much , and not expect the cholic phenomenon to be explained in detail ( from both the scientific and occult standpoint ) , you could actually enjoy this movie . Like I mentioned , the atmospherics is top notch , though the finale looked more like an action movie instead . And when the filmmakers do explain something important in the end , the reaction I'd reckon will be " Huh ? That's it ? " in a much ado about nothing manner .
A Nutshell Review : Three Times	Taiwanese auteur Hou Hsiao-Hsien's movie at The Picturehouse is a movie with three stories told very distinctly , one story after another . Take it as three short films rolled into one , with each actor playing different roles , each character having no distinct relation to their counterparts in different eras . Having them set in 1966 , 1911 and 2005 provided vastly different material for each short film to stand out from one another . The first , " A Time for Love " , is set in the swinging 60s of 1966 . Chang Chen plays an army enlistee who chances upon Shu Qi's working girl in a billiard parlor . He gets attracted to her , but she , not being a permanent staff , flits from one town to another . Undetered , he spends the weekend off to hunt for her , starting from KaoShiung where they last met , following a trail of different mailing addresses which takes him all over Taiwan . This short plays out like a bittersweet tale of budding love , where one will spare no effort in wanting to meet the girl of one's dreams . The second , " A Time for Freedom " , however , is a tough one to swallow . Set during 1911 , there is color , but alas , there's no audible dialog save for opera lyrics sung and Chinese classical music to set the stage . It plays out as a silent movie of sorts , and the dialog pieces are set in inter-titles which you have to read off to understand what the heck they're saying . Very stylish way to portray the era , one which attracted some snickering from the audience , but soon after , you'll have to get very used to the way this section gets presented . The story however , is nothing to shout about , and perhaps the most boring of the lot . Very easy to doze off in the Oscar chair I tell you . The last section , " A Time for Youth " is set in 2005 . Chang Chen plays a photographer , and Shu Qi , a bisexual Goth chick who is on the road to becoming straight , I think . Her character here is the most interesting of the lot , and also because Chang Chen's male leads in all three parts were somewhat ordinary , without an edge . While the first part's environment was in Taiwan's rural areas , which is probably used as it's easier to simulate the retro environment of the past , and the second's highly likely in a sound-stage , this one is familiar urban territory - capital Taipei . It probably is hip to feature lesbians in movies these days , as we see Shu Qi grapple with a clingy lesbian lover . But after having passionate throngs with Chang's character , I guess she must be having second thoughts , or really , is bothered by the clinginess . Throughout the three sections , dialog is quite scarce , except for perhaps the first one . Peppered most of the time in Hokkien , it was peculiar that the subtitles only had the Mandarin translation , totally neglecting English speaking folks . But for the Mandarin dialog , there was English subtitles . So for those who don't read Mandarin or understand oral Taiwanese styled Hokkien , be prepared to be lost for a bit during the movie . I didn't manage to tie down the inter-related themes of all 3 parts , except for the obvious one on love . The first , being in the 60s , was portrayed quite innocently , with shy smiles and little surprises and all . The second was more restrained in nature . Fact is , there's very little physical contact between the lovers . While the third opened with sex , which I suspect was snipped off here ( didn't see what was in the trailers : P ) . All three had appropriate music to accentuate the era's mood . You have classics like Smoke Gets In Your Eyes , and Rain and Tears ( the one used in the trailer ) , up against Operatic music , before closing the film with alternative music , sung in heavily Chinese accented English , whose lyrics don't make much sense , being adapted by Shu Qi's character encounters . Communication techniques used in the three movies were as accurate as can be , with A4 sized pen-written love letters , in contrast with ink-brushed wordings in large thin paper , and today's prevalent electronic communication with email and SMS . Perhaps it also serves to highlight the idea of love in those eras . One very innocent , one very plain , and one , non-permanent and fleeting . Maybe it's just me , but having watch three very arty representations by directors such as Malick , Retaruang and now Hou , made me a little jaded what with having movies where style takes precedence over substance . I think I need to chill out with something as mindless as Ice Age 2 or Ultraviolet soon . Need balance .
A Nutshell Review : Just Friends	I was half expecting this to be one of those lightly fluffed flicks which you go and laugh at , then forget almost everything about it thereafter . In some ways it is , but little did I realise that it actually had me thinking about one of the predicaments I was in previously , and it brought back some memories , both good and bad . Ryan Reynolds plays Chris Brander , a successful yuppie in the music industry , a swinging player in his own right , the self professed expert when it comes to relationships . He teams up with Anna Faris ( they starred together in an earlier movie Waiting ) , who in this movie plays a bimbotic pop rocker , Samantha James , moulded in your spears-simpson fashion , totally hot , and with bad attitude to boot . While they might have been a cute couple ( or so she thinks ) , Chris just cannot forget his childhood sweetheart , his first love Jamie Palamino ( Amy Smart , hitting the local screens for the second time this month , after her vase like role in Crank ) . 10 years ago , Chris was publicly humiliated while discovering that his sweetheart had placed him under the " friends " category , when he wanted something more . Yeah , every dating guy's worst nightmare , is to discover that the feeling's not mutual , and you're relegated to the " Just Friends " status ( hence the title ) . A fluke chance is presented when the successful Chris finds himself back in his hometown , and buys ample time in trying to rediscover and restrategize his gameplan to finally tell Jamie just how he feels about her , though tempted is he as well with the idea of a " revenge bang " . And you'd think the training in LA and the smoothness in his methods with hot models might work here . They don't , and they bring about the usual tired laughs of plans backfiring , and a potential rival from the past vying for the same affections . With the big time singer throwing tantrums in the small town , Samantha becoming a potential roadblock with her demanding ways , Chris ' deliberate and elaborate plans to deceive , his kid brother's idolization of Chris ' " girlfriend " the pop star , and a more than concerned mom , the ensemble is something that seemed quite familiar , though they come together really well . Eddie Murphy has done it , and so have Adam Sandler and Robin Williams . Probably any self respecting comedian would have to don a fat suit once in a while , and this time , it's Ryan Reynolds ' turn . Here he pulls off a number of personas - the confident swinger , the shy unsure low confidence fat teenager , blowing a hot temper when things don't go his way , and finally , the sensitive guy underneath it all . Anna Faris brings back her ditzy Scary Movies persona in a horny role that requires her to sing badly , while Amy Smart plays the complete opposite in the girl next door you just want to bring home to mom . And Chris Klein continues in yet another his jerk role after The Long Weekend , his first appearance as a rock star wannabe is totally hilarious , though somehow I think every pretty face has to appear once in a while behind an ugly mug . Throughout the movie , my mind was incessantly remembering stuff about my own past , on the relationships I had . It's quite uncanny that it could fall broadly into those two female characters - the one whom you adore so much , but always being unattainable , and the other whom , credit to her , doesn't give up on you , but yet faces your constant rejection . My heart sank as I realize , that this is a movie after all , that I won't have my own happy ending , try as I may . I must confess I've grown cynical , and gave up on trying at all . I'm stuck in the " Just Friends " category , and will probably stay there for the foreseeable future . While the movie has its expected Hollywood styled formula ending , you'd probably find something more in it if you've experience some elements yourself . Otherwise , it's another run off the mill forgettable movie . If the song Forgiveness sung by Anna Faris floats your boat , stay tuned during the end credits for the entire song . Simply hilarious with inane lyrics . Oh , and Ryan Reynolds completes his lip synching to All-4-One's I Swear , only for those who bother to stay behind .
A Nutshell Review : War of the Worlds	War of the Worlds marks the second collaboration between 2 of Hollywood's most influential figures , that of director Steven Spielberg and megastar Tom Cruise . In this updated adaptation of H . G . Well's classic , we revisit alien territory already familiar with Spielberg ( with evergreens like Close Encounters of the Third Kind , and E . T . ) , except that this time around , the aliens are not an iota friendly and wastes no time proving its point with its laser beams . Cruise plays Ray , a middle class salaried worker whose ex-wife ( Miranda Otto , in an underused role ) leaves their estranged kids with for the weekend . Being the selfish carefree man that he is , it is no wonder why he doesn't get much respect , especially from his son . Before you can say move on with the melodrama , worldwide lightning phenomenon gets TV coverage , and soon enough , the horror begins , as the well known battle tripods rise from beneath the earth and annihilate everything on site . The special effects are brilliant , and serves as an effective plot device for unspeakable , unexplainable horror . Spielberg teases you with indirect shots of the tripods , from mirrors and reflective surfaces , never letting you see from a first person's perspective for too long , keeping in pace with the initial suspense built . Terrorist attacks were mentioned in conversation , and perhaps this movie also serves as a timely reminder of always being prepared , with emergency equipment , stashes of food , and familiarity with emergency procedures . This film could take the easy way out and focus on the big explosions ala Independence Day , but since that was already done , we get to focus on the smaller picture , that of the survival of the family unit in crisis , and I applaud this approach . Conflicts arise and sometimes solved through unpopular decisions , and that's the way of life . Most times we do not have complete information , and need to make split second life determining decisions . However , the pace slackens toward the end of the movie , and steers us back with reminders that this is after all a summer action blockbuster , with predictable endings , some plot loopholes and worse , rushed explanations . Tom Cruise doesn't get to flash his pearly whites so often here , as we see a transformation from irresponsibility , and in his son's opinion , cowardice , to courageous dad whose children are his first priority . I'd dare say Cruise is in his element here , saving the day ( in a not so direct manner ) . Dakota Fanning shines as Ray's daughter Rachel , bringing forth a sense of vulnerability with her fear of enclosed spaces , and her love for her father and brother . Being the little damsel in distress , who wouldn't want to save her and ensure that she survives this horrible onslaught ? Serves well as a Hollywood summer blockbuster , but not the " most anticipated " for this year as claimed by some .
A Nutshell Review : Miss Gold Digger	The title says it all , about a woman who holds out from commitment because she's always in the hopes of snagging somewhere better , given the vast playing field out there from which to fish not only the rich , but in her own words , those with " money , future , power " . The cynical me wonders if this was the nail hit squarely on the head , that these are the secret underlying criteria these days before a woman would say yes . And if seeking out that someone would not be enough , as a guarantee , she even sows her own seeds , and cultivates her own venture with one of her longtime male friends . This is the story of Shin Mi-Su ( Han Ye-seul ) who when young dreams of being a real life Cinderalla , Snow White and Juliet , since after all their lovers were rich princes to boot . She's successful in her career in an ad agency , and with her gorgeous good looks , it provides an additional plus point naturally . But while she's pretty on the outside , she's really ugly on the inside , and this film chronicles how this duality and hypocrisy comes into play in almost all situations in her life . Han Ye-seul , who's up in the running for Best Actress in this year's AFFF , shows off her excellent acting with her two-faced , highly manipulative role , and does so effortlessly through her saucer eyes as they often betray ( for the audience's benefit ) her innermost thoughts and desires . Like Son Ye-jin's role in The Art of Seduction , Ye-seul's Mi-Su masters the art of seduction strategies in order to get her own way , or to obtain unfair advantages . If it's not money she's after , then it's the strings to be pulled one day . So who are those set in her sights ? Jun-seo ( Kwon Oh-jung ) the rich man looks like an automatic shoo-in with his expensive gifts , but his gruff exterior plants some doubts in her . It's not just enough to be loaded , but she wants to have the cake and eat it as well . Then there's the club rapper Hyeon-jun ( Son Ho-young ) who provides her the attention at the club , but that's just her fling at night when out having fun . And if you think a character like Mi-Su is desperate , look no further for proof than to entice her childhood friend Yun-cheol ( Kim In-kwon ) to pass the Bar exam and work his way up to District Attorney before she would even consider him as a life long partner , and goes all her way out in order to ensure that this plan succeeds . Which of course buys her time to look around for quicker ways to success of course . Then there's the new neighbour Dong-min ( Lee Jong-hyeok ) whom she starts off with the wrong footing , and always seem to be catching her at her worst behaviour . Her charms don't work , and this set up provides for some hilarious comic moments , which work because of Han Ye-seul's perfect timing . Given the limited scenes they act opposite each other , since her time is split rather evenly amongst all potential suitors , don't be expecting any great chemistry to be established . For all its feminist ra-ra with an alpha female in clear control over the exploitation of her sexuality and beauty , the film somehow retracts to romantic - comedy formula with some rather plain development mid way through the show , thereby leaving it devoid of any gravitas . Which means as a pure popcorn date movie , this works perfectly despite of its rather unresolved , open ending , that seems to echo some of the insecurities and indecisiveness that women perhaps face from time to time with regards to choosing , and whether they have made the right choice . So if you subscribe to what what this movie showcased , which is " money , fame and power " , then boys out there should better beware . 5Cs these days aren't enough , but the all encompassing three conditions spelt out , should .
A Nutshell Review : Pain	Perhaps the most controversial of all the short films , Pain features a sado-masochistic young man as the protagonist , and a faceless police man . The protagonist is a man looking for a job , without much success , and it seemed like he didn't even bother to try as he crosses out recruitment ads without much thought . He leads a vagrant lifestyle , patronizing a provision shop to get his daily supply of Marlboro , preserved plums and comic books . He idles his time away , and looks for the next big high by inflicting pain on his own body , starting from needles through fingertips , to the extinguishing of lit cigarettes on his skin , and to the use of razor blades to mutilate his body . However , with addiction , it's never enough , and the highlight consists of various sick tortures on his kidnapped victim , from having a chisel driven into the foot , the sawing off of a limb , the removal of an eyeball , and culminating to a beheading . It's an extremely dark film with minimal dialogue and a twist ending , backed by an edgy soundtrack . Though the SM parts looked very realistic , I thought the actual grizzly find of a dismembered human body in Singapore on the same day marred my enjoyment of this short film . A little too close for comfort somehow .
A Nutshell Review : ( DVD ) Accepted	The premise of this film is as ludicrous as it sounds , but I guess it takes a lot to try and mold a character into the next Ferris Bueller or Van Wilder . Justin Long stars as Bartleby Gaines , and the name will already tell you that it's not catchy enough with certain vibes as to the quality of this teenage comedy dwelling on the fantasies of students who well , don't meet the grade to further their studies . Justin Long seemed to languish in the doldrums and perhaps one of the few actors these days to seem satisfied with taking on rather mediocre roles , considering that he did headline flicks such as Jeepers Creepers , partnered Bruce Willis in Die Hard 4 , and had a whole hosts of supporting roles in movies , but still is unable to truly make everyone sit up , still waiting for that breakthrough role that other guys ( such as one called Shia ) have all the luck for . Some guys get all the luck as the song goes , while others just have to make do and wait for their time . And of course , the role of Bartleby Gaines is perfect for Long , given the character waits and gets rejected by just about every school out there , only for him to hatch a hare brain idea to start his own university , so that he can shake his parents off his back . With the help of good friend Sherman Schrader ( Jonah Hill , being incredibly fat here ) , they start a university aptly abbreviated as - South Harmon Institute of Technology , only that there's no proper support structure and administrative function , and what they think was just an empty shell in order to pull off their bluff . But of course , for a comedy to function , they soon realize that their website attracted like-minded and students facing similar rejections with no school to belong to , and with hundreds of students paying 10 grand each for an education , why not make the best of it ? It's a comparison on what real life is , and what the fantasized version has the potential to become , in being able to learn what you want to learn , and given plenty of room to experiment . It goes a long way in showcasing how everyone in charge of their own destiny , can actually benefit from taking a keen interest to further their respective expertise and skills in areas not taught solely in books , and frankly speaking , are able to excel by working on their strengths . Don't expect the usual slapstick or outright comedy here , as it does provide some food for thought , but only quite . It's really a juvenile story suitable for a lazy evening , as you partake in the dreams of a slacker who makes good his unintended promise to educate himself and his peers . Generally acceptable , but not great . The bare bones Code 3 DVD by Universal Home Video comes presented in anamorphic widescreen and audio is available in either English , Spanish or Portuguese Dolby Digital 5 . 1 . Subtitles are available in English , Spanish , Portuguese , Chinese , Cantonese and Korean , and has scene selection available over 16 chapters .
A Nutshell Review : Singles ( 1992 )	Love . Sex . Friendship . Companionship . These are the themes obviously explored in Cameron Crowe's early movie Singles , which revolve around the love lives of singles ( naturally ) living in a common apartment . We follow each of the protagonist Steve ( Campbell Scott ) , Janet ( Bridget Fonda ) , Cliff ( Matt Dillon ) and Linda ( Kyra Sedgwick ) through their ups and downs in dealing with the weird little emotion called Love . Well , not quite . As we know early in the film , each have problems and their own peculiar viewpoints on the dating scene . We see Linda meeting and breaking up with a Spanish student she was so into , after seeing through his lies and sweet talk . It hurts , and she doesn't want to be hurt again . Steve too have had a bad experience , and ( I can identify with this ) swears off relationships for the next few years , deciding instead to focus on career . As Fate would have had it , these two will meet at the unlikeliest places and get into a relationship . Cliff , an aspiring rocker , seemed to have taken his girlfriend Janet , for granted . And I think this is something that most people can identify with . When efforts go unappreciated , or when things go mundane , the question is , do you want to bail out ? And when you do , what next ? Would you give the ex another chance ? If you do , how would you approach it ? It's fun watching a movie that was made 13 years ago , and you wonder about how the initiating and sustaining of a relationship back then happened without technology which we are so used to these days . Back then , a mobile phone was a cordless one , and there is no such thing as an instant message , but an answering machine . Where Speed Dating was unheard of , but Video Dating was the rage ( check out the funny Tim Burton cameo ) . You wonder too about the career of the leads . Campbell Scott was noticed by many after his pairing with Julia Roberts in the movie Dying Young , but after this , seemed to have vanished into obscurity . And so has Kyra Sedgwick . Only Matt Dillon and Bridget Fonda are still around , somewhere . Oh , the music . Peppered throughout the movie is the wonderful musical tracks that always seem to punctuate a particular moment succinctly . I like Tarantino and Crowe movies because music plays an integral part of the entire experience , and Singles too had excellent ballads blended with grunge rock , say , Pearl Jam ( before they made it huge ) , which also made an appearance . It's a beautiful , quirky little movie with excellent identifiable dialogue , music , humour , and a younger cast of stars whom we know today , thrown into situations that everyone in love would have experienced .
A Nutshell Review : Kungfu Hustle	I missed the Stephen Chow movies of old , before his forays into the US Market with Shaolin Soccer and now Kungfu Hustle , where his movies were inane , slapstick and filled with witty dialogue that entirely made no sense . But don't misread me , I'm not saying that this flick is no good . There are classic Chow moments , but somehow I feel that they ain't enough . The Kungfu and its effects remind you of The Matrix Trilogy , with its bullet time effects , and even Axe Gang members and fight scenes that resemble the Burly Brawl , no surprise though , as the fight choreographer is Yuen Wo Ping . Character development , like all Chow movies , are zilch and cartoony , and the female lead in this film , although va-va-voom , is classic flower vase material , and she doesn't even say anything , how's that ? ! Put your brains at the door and you'll have an entertaining time .
A Nutshell Review : Night Watch	After Bimmer , which I enjoyed , this is the other Russian film that has hit our shores . Simplistically put , this is the first of a fantasy-thriller trilogy , about the eternal fight between good and evil forces . A truce is called centuries ago , where battle lines and jurisdictions are drawn . The breed of man known as the Others , are divided into the light side , and the dark side . The light Others form the Night Watch , while the dark Others form the Day Watch ( the title of the second part of the trilogy ) . There will be Others who will be discovered and have to decide to join either side , and the light / dark side cannot influence their decision . Hence , the watch groups set up to ensure the truce and this requirement is met . However , with any of such arrangements , you can be sure of rogue elements trying their luck to go against regulations . Prophecy states that there will be one Other who will tip the balance in favour of the side he joins , and like Episode One , this prophetic Other forms the basis of this movie , as with the quest to entice this Other to join their respective sides . We follow the tale of Anton Gorodetsky , a newly discovered light Other who has the power to peek into the future . On a routine mission , he chanced upon a cursed woman who has unwittingly unleashed catastrophic mayhem unto Moscow , and another sub plot involving Anton's accidental killing of a dark Other , a terribly bad no-no , given the truce . That's about as far as I would say about the plot , as any more will destroy the surprises in store for the viewer - the ending when revealed , will make you rethink what you have seen . What's more important are the themes discussed , like the perceived corruption in the system of bureaucracy , and the notion that well-meaning intentions are sometimes not well appreciated nor interpreted as such . The movie is stylishly shot , with set action pieces making you exclaim WOW . At times , it brings to mind an old TV series called " Manimal " , as there are no lack of characters here who take on the form , or can transform to and from animals like an owl or a leopard . For the international version , even the subtitles are not spared special effects , and I eagerly anticipated when the next effect filled subtitle will appear . Look out for the spinal-cord-sword , which I think is extremely cool . I could go on about characters going into the " Gloom " or the effects of the vampires slipping into and out of peripheral vision , but any more ravings will probably be a trip into spoiler zone . The soundtrack is an interesting blend of rock and electronica , and fans of The Bravery will be pleased that the band lent their track Fearless to the international trailer , and is played at the end credits . The villains are somewhat muted in Night Watch , but watch this anyhow because of the strong setup for the trilogy , and prepare for the Day Watch , which I think will turn the spotlight on the characters of the dark Others .
A Nutshell Review : ( DVD ) 10 Things I Hate About You	10 Things I Hate About You is one of your typical teenage romantic comedy , loosely based on William Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew . Taking place over a semester with the introduction of new kid on the block Cameron ( Joseph Gordon-Levitt ) and culminating in the school prom , the movie has a surprising number of sight gags and plenty of pop music throughout , so much so that it really does have a bloated soundtrack which seem to give a whole extended music video feel to it all . As with plenty of the Bard's stories , there's quite an ensemble cast assembled , starting with the Shrew herself Kat ( Julia Stiles ) and Bianca Stratford ( Larisa Oleynik ) , two sisters who are living under their father's strict house rules of no dating until graduation . Despite Dad's ultra protective nature in having his daughters live out his worst fear of being impregnated , the rules do get modified - Bianca can date if Kat dates , and that in itself is a tall order given Kat's nasty I-don't-give-a-damn attitude . And the suitors in competition are none other than Cameron , who's after Bianca , and his rival the school heartthrob Joey ( Andrew Keegan ) . As with Shakespeare's stories , expect a little strategizing and some mistaken intentions at certain points , with Patrick Verona ( Heath Ledger with that trademarked frizzy hair ) being roped by the two men to woo Kat , thereby freeing them to go after the girl of their dreams . Without gazing into the crystal ball , you'll know that Patrick will probably fall for Kat for real , and thereby complicating matters , affecting even his own chances . For the most parts I thought where in the movie will the title be referenced , because it doesn't seem to be the case , but when it finally is included into the plot , it's actually quite an emotional , moving piece . The introduction perhaps inspired Pretty Persuasion , with the orientation of the rookie in the school premises , pointing out the various cliques and school politics . The supporting casts , especially the school teachers , were fun and totally opposite what you might consider proper conduct . And I thought it was pretty fluffy material until the romance between Patrick and Kat touched upon impressions , and the building of walls as a defense mechanism to fragile hearts . I thought that was a pretty frank outlook , with the characters mentioning it as a matter of fact . Still , don't expect the masterpiece although it's based on a classical play . The editing and narrative flow do seem to be choppy at times , with transitions proved to be quite abrupt , allowing me to suspect that some scenes ended up on the cutting room floor for some reason , except to smoothen the flow . It's quite jarring and sticks out like a sore thumb , but nonetheless it's still a fairly enjoyable movie for a lazy weekend afternoon .
A Nutshell Review : Ebola Syndrome	Back in the early 90s , I recall widespread concern about incurable diseases such as the Ebola virus , and Hollywood taking the premise and churning out movies such as Outbreak and the such . In Hong Kong cinema , director Herman Yau cemented his cult status for films with excessive graphic depiction of sex and violence with this movie - Ebola Syndrome . As compared to the other cult hit The Untold Story , you can spot various similarities in terms of presentation style , and certain plot elements and development . Again the lead role , Kai San , is played by Anthony Wong , this time with long frizzy hair , and begins the movie with both sex ( with his boss ' wife ) and violence ( yet another gruesome massacre played out in full on screen , coupled with sexual violence ) . Naturally he becomes a fugitive and escapes to outside Hong Kong - this time to South Africa , and becomes an employee at a local Chinese restaurant . The similarities do not end there . You just cannot wait for the next dismemberment and the making of the new " char siew bao " , now termed African Buns for local flavour . Expect more hard unflinching violence , and this time too with the camera unmoved from the decapitation of animals like chickens and frogs - heart still pumping , and the slicing out of innards , or the chopping off of legs . Sure puts you off your next bowl of frog leg porridge . And serving as another reminder , is not to offend your cook , as he has the power to include unwanted ingredients , including bodily fluids ! Rapid fire profane dialogue is a standard , and sometimes comical as the characters rattle off combinations of vulgarities with ease . But just in case you wonder if Ebola Syndrome is The Untold Story rehashed in a different setting , rest assure that only the good gory bits from Untold get squeezed into the first half of Ebola . Unfortunately the second half seemed to want to move away tangentially from its predecessor , and kept its focus on the contact with , and spreading of the disease . Stemming from Kai San's inability to keep his pants on , he takes advantage of a comatose African tribe woman , who unknowing to him , is a victim of the Ebola virus . With an incredible stroke of luck , he survives the infection and becomes a virus carrier , spreading the disease in South Africa no thanks to his African Buns , and amongst prostitutes when he returns to Hong Kong . The rest of the movie becomes a comedy somewhat with the police attempts to contain the virus as well as to apprehend Kai San . Nothing too fancy in its second half treatment . One more thing , look out carefully at the cameos and extras !
A Nutshell Review : The Heartbreak Kid	I'm a fan of Ben Stiller and his brand of comedy , and I rate his insanely good looking ( heh ) Derek Zoolander as one of my contemporary favourites , alongside his Dodgeball opposite Vince Vaughn , and his Meet The Parents / Fockers combo . But perhaps the most memorable and highly rated laughfest will be his starring in the Farrelly Brothers ' There's Something About Mary , with Matt Dillon and Cameron Diaz as the ditzy blonde the two guys are trying to go after . The Heartbreak Kid brings Stiller back to the Farrelly Brothers ' fold , joining forces again to bring in the laughs in a situation that unmarried guys my age fear . While we may be nonchalant about staying single and enjoying the status to sow our wild oats , there's always this nagging thought about what would happen when we seem to have met that special someone who could be just the very person to spend the rest of our life with . Thinking about " forever " , that it's a long time , make us go into weighing in the pros and the cons of giving up our freedom , and we just want to be darn sure ( and suicidal ) to be giving up our singlehood . And for forty year old Eddie ( Stiller ) , he shares the same sentiments , but on the advise of best buddy Mac ( Rob Corddry ) , who himself is a hen-pecked husband , and Casanova dad Doc ( Jerry Stiller , Ben's real father ) , he marries Lila ( Malin Akerman ) , the blonde akin to Cameron Diaz's Mary in the earlier Farrelly-Stiller collaboration , on a whim after six weeks of courtship . While on the surface , she's physically da bomb , and might seem all nice and dandy inside , little does Eddie know the nightmare is about to begin , as he discovers ( say what ? ) they share very little interests , she's the archetypal dumb blonde always made fun of in blonde jokes , and she's a sexual nymph who likes it very rough ( ok , so some of us out there might take this as a plus point ) . If there's a moral to the story , that will be to consider very carefully , and to take your time before you commit to that matrimonial vow . You might call me old-fashioned , but I believe that once you walk down that aisle , you'll just have to stick with the woman you marry , for better or worse , and learn to accept her faults . After all , nobody's perfect . But this is a movie , so if anyone is holding onto such real-world ideal notions , then you'll probably not have a good time , and start to frown at every Eddie antic at his horror of discovery , and worse , when he starts to develop feelings for Miranda ( Michelle Monaghan , last scene on the big screen playing Ethan Hunt's wife in MI : III ) , an equally attractive woman who probably shares more of the same interests as Eddie , whom he met while on honeymoon . Wait a minute , cheating on your wife during honeymoon ? Yes , which is why the conservatives out there will leave with a bad aftertaste . But for the rest of us , it examines the type of dilemma for someone having second thoughts ( after all , these are fertile grounds for affairs ) . The narrative starts to junk the comedy and move into romance-drama gears , but lest you forget this is still a Farrelly Brothers ' movie , their trademark sexually vulgar scenes and jokes come and surprise you when you least expect . Body parts ( there's this scene involving bodily fluids which you just have to see to believe the insane audacity of it all ) and orifices are no longer sacred . Comedy of errors are standard fare , as are the increasing inserts of gay jokes whenever possible . However most jokes were still on Lila , and plenty of that were already included in the trailer , so if you haven't watched it , don't . As a comedy , The Heartbreak Kid somehow didn't live up to its promise . Sure it has its moments , but they were few and far between , and in reality , you'll probably enjoy the Eddie - Miranda romantic scenes ( and those with her family ) a lot more than you would the Eddie - Lila comedic scenes . Does it have an ending and resolution to Eddie's dilemma of which girl to choose ? Yes , but it turned out to be extremely clunky and unfunny ( try as it would want to ) , dragging out the last act unnecessarily to put this movie close to a two hour runtime . It's still a comedy after all , so don't expect a very powerful and emotional close ala dramatic fare like Castaway , which it tried to ape , with a comedic slant of course . Deinitely not one of Stiler's , or the Farrelly Brother's best work to date . Stay tuned for the cameo appearance of one prominent TV actress at the close , and stay tuned during and after the end credits . There's a scene involving Lila , which probably isn't in very good taste , showing how she managed to get satisfied , and the other bringing you back to 1975 to confirm a certain event which was mentioned in passing .
A Nutshell Review : Death Note : The Last Name	A warning to all who attempt to watch this without watching the first movie - you'll be lost , totally . It doesn't come with a summary or a montage , and dives right into where the first film left off . You'll probably have plenty of questions , and there is almost zero character introduction . Even the brisk recap of the Death Note capabilities quickly flips by , offering you no time to complete reading what's on screen . So you've been warned . LIght Yagami ( Tatsuya Fujiwara ) now becomes part of the team hunting down Kira , and a reluctant L ( Ken'ichi Matsuyama ) still refuses to drop his assumptions of Light being Kira himself . However , a new Kira emerges , thereby casting doubts on L's theory , and its seems that this new Kira is more powerful than the last . Another battle of wits ensues , but this time , who's playing who , and at what price ? The cast here is basically the same , just that bit characters Misa Amane ( Erika Toda ) and Tota Matsuda ( Sota Aoyama ) get expanded roles here , to balance the strong testosterone flavour seen in the 1st movie ( ok , not quite , since both Light and L are exactly hunks ) , and given that they're beautiful , I sure am not complaining . Their roles as the television celebrity and the news reporter respectively aren't flower vases by design , and are totally involved in the plot , though still pawns in the entire scheme of things . What made the first movie interesting , even though for the most parts it's devoted to setting up the premise , was that there were many bits of surprises and revelations along the way . Here , all the bits and pieces are sacrificed for one major plot , with Sacrifice being the recurrent theme here , and although we learn more of the capabilities and limitations of the Death Note , it lacks the freshness of its predecessor as everything was hinged on that grand central scheme . And being just one scheme , it had the weight on the entire movie hinging on it to make , or break . Also , there were many moments which made it too contrived , and largely dependent on plenty of coincidences and lucky breaks , even up to predicting how others would behave . Compared to the first , it just didn't cut it , and came across as lazy storytelling on the filmmakers ' part . Even though the ending of the first movie was made of predicting what others would do , and involves being ahead many steps of the way , the same technique as presented in the sequel , is far too complex with many determinants hanging in limbo , for it to work as it should . The pacing didn't help , and its dragged out finale was almost laughable , adhering to the tragic villain soliloquy for far too long . However by then , you'll be glad that it's just all over . I suspect if the two movies are watched back to back , it'll be more enjoyable than watching both as standalones . Still , it makes for some good harmless entertainment on lazy afternoons .
A Nutshell Review : Hide and Seek	Would Dakota Fanning be the next Natalie Portman , or Christina Ricci ? It's not a longshot , given the credible performance here in Hide and Seek . I still remembered that she managed to stand on her own against the enigmatic Denzel Washington in Man on Fire , and here , she does a commendable job beside veteran Robert De Niro . The premise of the show suggests suspense , thrills and maybe something of the supernatural perhaps ? It explores the relationship between a psychologist and his daughter , after their wife / mother died in a suicide , or is it ? What is the impact to a child who witnesses the death of a parent ? Whilst the blood and gore are kept to a minimum , what you can't see actually sends shivers to you . The buildup shows a lot of potential , but too many red herrings and the pacing at the end leaves much to be desired . Any alert movie goer will anticipate and guessed the twist that is offered halfway through the film , and once that is done , the narrative seems to drag itself into an ending . Robert De Niro breezes through his role - nothing new to offer here , whilst Famke Janssen and Elizabeth Shue up the babe factor . Watch this not expecting a tight narrative or a shocking ending , but watch this for Fanning's performance .
A Nutshell Review : xXx2	Watching this film is like being with your current beau and yet constantly reminded of your ex . We all know that Xander Cage ( Vin Diesel ) is not the xXx in this show , and he's being replaced by Darius Stone ( Ice Cube ) . Heck , I think the producers make the mistake of killing Xander Cage - mentioned in the movie as being killed in action in Bora Bora , Afghanistan , because in my opinion his character makes an excellent action hero . That's reminiscence number one - being reminded of what could have been if the charismatic Vin Diesel continued for this film . Throughout the film , we see some similarities with Xanda or scenes from the original xXx . Like a scene in a diner with Gibbons ( good IL mo-fo Samuel L Jackson , who's given more screen time this time around ) , a sea-craft ride down a river , wisecracks on the moniker xXx ( " I sound like a porn star " ) , the reluctance of being drawn into the game of cloak and daggers , and ( mis ) quoting one of my favourite lines in the original - " The things I would do for my country " ! But while Xander Cage's an extreme sports person , Darius Stone is more " in your face " , given his military background in covert ops , with a penchant for some fries and a shake . The original film's delivery is more subtle , more elegant , while this one's more direct and in a way , nothing different from another action flick . The action is standard Hollywood-blow-em-up fest , right from the beginning and never lets up throughout the film . Everything's bigger ( M1 Abrams Tank , Aircraft Carrier , Choppers ) , noisier ( guns and explosions everywhere ) and faster ( modified cars and humongous wheels ) . No doubt the movie looks good given that the action pieces looks expensive , and effects well done by Industrial Light and Magic . Did I mention the girls ? We get 2 in this one , but their roles are merely decorative , unlike Asia Argento's meatier and eye - " candier " chick role in xXx1 . And the villains are your good old one-dimensional foes who tend to lapse into monologues , and I feel that Willem Dafoe is a bit underutilized . My only gripe with this film is that xXx has to rely on his boyz n the hood - it's actually quite hilarious to see street gangs take on military might , " carjacking " a tank and actually winning . Not too credible , but hey , it's only a movie . Did you know this film is called " xXx : State of the Union " in the US ( referring to the President's State of the Union Address , which forms the finale ) , but I guess for those outside who don't care less about US politics , we're pretty OK with the dumbed-down title of " xXx2 : The Next Level " - makes it sound like some arcade game . So buckle up and enjoy the ride , and if this is proved as popular as the original , we might see xXx3 ( given the setting up of a sequel at the end ) , and the possibility of seeing a new face as the new xXx . Now if the producers just stop killing them , I'd think it's pretty cool to see a couple of xXxs teaming up . Ooh . . . the potential for more mayhem !

A Nutshell Review : Playing Solo	The debut feature film of Finnish director Lauri Nurkse , Playing Solo tells the story of three individuals who are just that - selfish people who have to learn how to change themselves in order to live with one another . Based on the novel by Katja Kallio , it brings to mind the constant tussle in the modern world of how one can be so easily caught up with work , that relationships often take a back seat , for better or worse . We have Emma Huilu ( Saija Lentonen ) , a reporter in a long distance relationship that recently ended , and in a stroke of luck from an occupational hazard , gets to meet possibly the sexiest orchestra conductor alive in Joel Abrahamsson ( Lari-Pekka Toivonen ) to conduct a last minute interview . Needless to say , sparks fly immediately , they go on a whirlwind romance , and before you know it , he soon loads her up with his personal problem - that of taking care of his aged mom Lea ( Kristiina Elstela ) who is beyond control in the nursing home's she put up in . The character of Joel is your typical alpha-male type whose jet-setting career and reputation puts him in the clear path of temptation , and how he battles that would naturally have repercussions in his relationship with Emma . Toivonen plays this role with ease because of his stature and good looks , and exudes enough pathos given the frustrations of his childhood and his difficult mom . We think that he's the poor victim here when we see how he gets dumped by a pregnant ex-girlfriend , but there's more than meets the eye to this handsome man . Saija Lentonen on the other hand had a deeper role to play , though nothing unexpected since we see a strong , independent woman succumb to being needy , and you're likely to feel that she had made a number of missteps and was being blatantly silly . But then love is blind , and you would like to trust the best in your partner , though ultimately I still think that the finale didn't do the story , and her character , justice at all . Stealing the show every step of the way is of course Kristiina Elstela as the strong-willed mom who doesn't accept any nonsense from anyone . Clearly missing her son who's never emotionally there for her , much of the comedy stems from her razor sharp wit . With Joel being out of the picture for the most part , the story then takes on the spin of bonding amongst women , who between them at first was full of animosity , but nothing beats some earnestness in holding out that olive leaf . Both have lessons for each other , and their dynamics brought to life by the actresses are one of the key highlights of the film . And there's a particular scene which I enjoyed , as it dealt with the notion of time , devotion and returns . It brought about the thought of having to understand someone , a stranger perhaps , in order to have some form of meaningful conversation . But like in many scenes which involve Joel , life in itself is one where it's easy to take things for granted , and usually we devote time to pursuits which translate to economic gains , rather than to spend that same amount of time , or even a quality fraction of it , with the people we love , just to understand them a little bit more , and to spend time because we simply want to . Playing Solo reinforces the reminder that there should always be time to stop and smell the roses , and that family should always come first . It's true that we sometimes cannot stand the little idiosyncrasies of loved ones , but ultimately we should never take things for granted , and nobody should be flying solo in his or her lifetime . This comedy-romance comes recommended for that theme alone , despite an ending that I just couldn't agree with completely .
A Nutshell Review : All The Boys Love Mandy Lane	All the boys love Mandy Lane , and the way she is portrayed by Amber Heard , who wouldn't ? She's blonde , she's demure , she's so hot that the camera in the movie's introduction to the character , lingered on her T & As . She's a fine athlete though we don't really get to know what kind of graaes she's getting . Every boy in school wants to talk to her , and every one of them wants to get into her pants , earning bragging rights to be the first amongst everyone else to have conquered probably the last bastion of virginity in school . People would do silly things like dying for her too . In typical slasher flick formula , a group of students , Mandy included , organized themselves for a getaway in a secluded ranch , where a ranch hand Garth ( Anson Mount ) provides that element of question as to who amongst the group will be the hunter , and who will fall as prey . Like how the formula warns against decadent teenage lifestyles , such as the unwritten rules of having the non-virgin being dispatched first and the likes , you're constantly kept guessing as everyone in the group , save for our goody-two-shoes Mandy , get sloshed in a flood of sin , with the smoking of weed , snorting of coke , being highly sexually charged and active , and downing alcohol as if it was water . It does take quite a while for the first person to fall , and you probably won't feel much for the characters that had to kick the bucket in the most violent of deaths , which get shown quite graphically , only to pull back at the last minute through visual tricks and edits the filmmakers use . But for slasher flick fans , it's a long ride to get to this stage , and frankly speaking given that the characters all don't appeal to you ( i . e . you couldn't care less if they live or die ) , the movie does seem to coast along the tried and tested , until its last act . Surprisingly , the narrative decided to reveal its boogeyman quite early on in the film , which provided some perplexing questions . Again for those familiar with the genre , there'll always be a thought niggling in your mind in disbelief that the plot would be so straight forward . Granted as mentioned , the payload comes at the finale , which I thought had two meanings , depending on which concept you subscribe to . First , following reality that the most perverse amongst us tend to be the one most disconnected , and second , punishment coming from someone who doesn't see eye to eye on immoral lifestyles , and want to put a deadly stop to it . I did see the revelation coming , but for the longest time had decided not to believe my gut feeling in the hopes that it would develop into something that will genuinely blow my mind . It's not perfect , but it did have its moments with the following of recent trends in the slasher genre that bad guys don't have to necessarily finish last . Nothing fanciful here , but it still worked to a certain degree . And kudos to both the casting director in putting Amber Heard in the titular role , and for the actress to pull off one of the more memorable lead characters in such a genre flick .
A Nutshell Review : ( DVD ) Murder Take One ( 2005 )	The movie opens with a very stunning tracking shot with a view of a motionless woman's body , from the feet , before slowly revealing that she's lying in a pool of blood , juxtaposed with the linear motion of time where investigators flood the crime scene in her hotel room , before pulling further backwards to become the eye in the sky , where you can see the neighbours of her room ( some bickering , some having sex ) truly oblivious with what's going on a few doors down , and panning outwards to the facade of the hotel , then descending rapidly to the porch area where more cops congregate , and it's revealed that a prime suspect has been arrested . Unveiling in 48 hours , we follow the investigators , led by prosecutor Yeon-ki ( Cha Seung - won ) as they try to break down Kim Young-hoon ( Shin Ha-gyoun ) , in what I thought was an extended interrogation system which somehow tested your patience with the cat-and-mouse styled challenges each side throw to the other in a series of dares and defiances . Thankfully , the plot does move on to other more conventional aspects of investigations , as always , everything is more than meets the eye , and no stone should be left unturned . What's also peculiar in the movie is the combination of a current affairs television show which interferes in the investigations , and audaciously tries to swing its outcome via its own panel of experts , piecing together of clues , and having an audience participation , which of course is used to boost ratings , but to the irk of Yeon-ki . There are plenty of stuff which unfortunately becomes loss in translation , and most of them are the comedic aspects from the dialogue . What was supposed to be some comedy mixed in , becomes a fairly serious investigative mystery movie when you're reliant on the subtitles . As with the standard investigative drama fare , there are moments which shine as the investigators manage to shed new light and clues , though it somehow went downhill with the introduction of some mediums - don't laugh though , because I do think there's a certain amount of mysticism at times when the authorities get flabbergasted - some help from the other side won't hurt at all right ? Especially so when you call on the right person to reappear . In any case , there are enough twists and turns , and at one point my hair did stand on its end in a chilling scene , but ultimately , what was supposed to be a stunner of a revelation , turned out to be quite anti-climatic . There are some nice observations made about investigations though , pertaining to CCTVs , so if you're interested , you can probably watch this to find out what those challenges are .
A Nutshell Review : Chocolate	In this part of the world , there's no dearth of male action heroes , you know , those with real martial arts background . Think Jet Li , Jackie Chan , Donnie Yen , Wu Jing , and closer to home , Tony Jaa . How about a female counterpart ? You're likely to struggle hard to name a credible one , Michelle Yeoh notwithstanding . So Thai director Prachya Pinkaew is probably shrewd enough to identify this golden opportunity , and so introduces us to Yanin Vismistananda in her debut feature Chocolate . Those familiar with Pinkaew's martial arts extravaganzas with Ong Bak and Tom Yum Goong , will know roughly what to expect from Chocolate . Since the rumoured falling out with his main star of those movies , there's definitely some big shoes to fill , and Yanin fills them quite nicely , martial arts wise , though there were certain scenes which were quite clear that she's still a diamond in the rough with many edges left to polish . But that's not to put down her effort , except that I thought as a lady , her final delivery of those choreographed punches and kicks lacked some really hard hitting edge to them , and the curious observation that some required some speeding up , was left to be desired . What could also be improved , is the transitions between fights , because each seemed pretty much stand alone , even though you know that she's supposedly to be battling enemies continuously , but with each combatant , there seemed to be a " reset " to on-guard mode . But what was learned from the earlier two Thai action movies , was that it was no longer necessary to repeat the action from different camera angles . This would stem from confidence in showing off the stunts from a single viewpoint , and not feel sore from not being able to cover it from multiple angles . And Chocolate had some really nice buildup in the complexity of these set action pieces . It teases with what's over the horizon starting from a few thugs at a street performance , and sets up carefully crafted action sequences for our heroine to flit from one to another , each being an excuse to dispatch goon after goon coming at her . Influences from Hong Kong action movies are without doubt , as you can recount similar settings in various HK movies being incorporated here , such as Fong Sai-Yuk's half - crouching styled fights under a stage . What was internalized in Chocolate , was probably from the Jackie Chan styled school of action , which fuses some bit comedy , with the utilizing of everyday objects in one's surroundings to throw off opponents , or worked into the action piece as a prop for acrobatic stunts to be performed . I'd bet there are numerous sequences here that Jackie Chan himself would approve and be proud of . And in true Jackie Chan culture , besides the end credits featuring some of the NG shots and injuries to the stars and stunt folk , you'll be glad to know that Yanin did most of her own stunts , and it's indeed no mean feat fighting in a skirt of that length , without it getting in the way . While the finale battle involves countless of Crazy88 types ala Kill Bill in wave after wave of attacks , culminating in battling it out on the facade of a multi-storey shophouse building complete with smashing windows , ledges and neon signboards , my personal favourite had to be at the abattoir . In reddish hues , the villains are sans shirts , meaning risks of personal injury are higher without padding that can be hidden underneath the clothes . And with menacing looking meat hooks hanging , and using cleavers as projectiles , just make your job drop at how these fights were choreographed and filmed , especially the slamming of bodies against concrete stalls . Action aside , the first 30 minutes or so was devoted to developing Yanin's Zen ( heh ) character , a young autistic girl born of gangster parents - Dad Masashi ( Hiroshi Abe ) is a non-self-respecting Yakuza member who doesn't have a body full of tattoos , and Mom Zin ( Ammara Siripong ) belongs to the Thai triads , and ex-moll of its head honcho . In a Romeo - Juliet styled love springing from only hate , only in Singapore do you have the sex scene severely edited , which I thought was important as that's how Zen was conceived . Violence is OK , but sex is zero here . Anyway Dad had to exile himself back to Japan to avoid an all out gang war , and Zin now becomes an outcast single parent , who has to struggle with cancer , as well as raising an autistic child . Children of such nature are usually referred to as special , and the specialness of Zen is her ability to pick up martial arts by observation . Hence thanks to DVDs of Pinkaew's earlier movies , and having to reside beside a Muay Thai school , Zen picks up the skills necessary , and get to use them when she goes hunting for her mother's debtors in order to pay for chemotherapy sessions . Money's everyone's problem , so Zen gets to use her fists , knees and elbows on her opponent's face , body and shin . I'd always love watching knees and elbows connect to deliver blows on opponents and inflicting excruciating pain , and in her lithe form , Zen delivers them with balletic grace . Anyway I'd guess no one's really interested in how the story gets developed , which is not without its fair share of loopholes , but we're all here to watch Yanin Vismitananda kick some serious butt . And she does so convincingly enough to warrant a fan following onto her next movie , and make it an action one please !
A Nutshell Review : The Sting of Death	Having sat through a weekend of the Japanese Film Festival so far , The Sting of Death got an unceremoniously high number of walk outs . I'm somewhat curious about how this movie got selected to fit into the theme of this year's festival of true . romance , because it really looked a little out of place , or anti-themed , with its grappling on the stark emotions of betrayal and lack of trust . The movie opens , and for the next 15 minutes , we see a couple in conversation , but their body language is awkward . We see a lady , but we hear a man in the room too , and while both are obviously talking to each other , they do not have the other in their line of sight . As the camera reveals a little more , we see the house in a little disarray , suggesting a fight of sorts taking place earlier . As they go further in their conversation , we slowly realize that here's a woman who has confronted her husband on his infidelity , and finding the truth a bitter pill that is hard to swallow . With escalating quarrels and fights getting more violent , it's always the case that the children will be the ones who suffer . Toshio ( Ittoku Kishibe ) and Miho's ( Keiko Matsuzaka ) kids know what is happening ( yes , kids actually know ) , and are always found to be torn between the parents . But I guess despite their differences , they have probably decided to stick to each other for the sake of their children , while working out the demons between them . Ironing out the problems posed by infidelity is tricky , because it involves re-establishing trust which had been broken before , and there is no guarantee that it won't be broken again . And it is precisely this insecurity that Miho fails to address , despite constant assurances by her husband . On that premise alone , The Sting of Death held promise . We tear out our hair together with Miho as she begins her descent , when all things appear fine , she'll rake up something about the past to ask Toshio , knowing very well that whatever answer she'll get , will hurt her deep down . Until Toshio refuses to play the game , and finds life getting a lot tougher , and Miho a lot more difficult to handle . Technically , this was a good film , with its minimalist sound providing avenues for other more subtle noises to come through , like the dripping tap which drives you nuts with its constant " drip . . . drip . . . drip " . But it's not an easy film to sit through , not only because of its content repetitive material and scenes which wash-rinse-repeats Miho doubting Toshio , questioning him , scenes of abuse and challenge , reconciliation , then repeat , but also because it moves so slowly , if at all . Somehow I tend to believe that my reliance on the subtitles didn't manage to bring out the intricate dialogue between the spouses , especially when they start to mince their words and lace them with sarcasm . Offhand I can't recall a movie that dealt with the issue of infidelity within a marriage more sharply than this , and by bringing home this point , this film has earned its badge of merit . Reminder : Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned , and all parties suffer through moments of folly .
A Nutshell Review : Yes Man	It's been a while since Jim Carrey hit the screens , going back to his comedic roots after the rather lacklustre dramatic turn in the thriller The Number 23 . But it's a somewhat muted Carrey we get , as gone out the window are the over the top antics and rubbery face , and in comes a fine balance between getting the laughs , as well as having some dramatic flair in crafting a believable working class character who is jaded with work and life in general , opting instead to coast through life almost like a recluse . And when a friend told me that this character was somewhat familiar , I understand his point . I suppose most of us could probably identify with the very routine lives that we're leading , juggling work and whatever effort we can muster to have a semblance of balance , either with family , friends , or spending some quality time investing in oneself . But this means regressing into the tried , tested and safe , losing that spark that comes with the randomness of living , and the gaining of experience that would have been gained . In fact , it brought back some memories that I was once a Yes Man myself , and I won't deny that somewhere along the way I've taken a detour , though it was a conscious decision at that . Jim Carrey plays Carl Allen , a junior loans officer at a bank who spends his time at work , and his personal life , in saying no to everyone and to opportunities , ignoring calls and well meaning efforts from friends to bring him out of his shell . But a life changing seminar ( I've been to something similar , even though it was just a preview ) with pop music , enthusiastic energizer-bunny type attendees , and an enigmatic speaker , would convince him to take the plunge into make a covenant to say yes to every opportunity that comes by . Not that he has any choice since the self-help guru is played by Terence Stamp , and nobody has the audacity to say no to General Zod . ( Curiously , Terence Stamp has been in plenty of supporting roles of late ) . So begins a series of situational comedies , most of which would already have been captured in the trailer . Carl begins to live life as he wanted to , taking lessons , meeting people , and what I found to be most appealing , would be to convert from a person of negative thoughts , to a positive thinking fellow . His new attitude opens doors , and almost instantly he reaps the benefits of this new found approach , the best of course is the encounter with hot chick Allison ( Zooey Deschanel ) . Besides the philosophy behind the movie , Yes Man is also a romance , with two random people who are totally opposites , coming together because of their spontaneity , and how strongly and positively different a relationship which isn't routine would provide for a couple . I suppose to a certain degree I tasted some form of success at this going where the wind brings approach , though that of course was a long time back . Naturally they fall heads over heels with each other , but like all romances , there's no such thing as smooth sailing , even though this takes place in the last act and rides to the finale fairly quickly . I more than welcome Zooey Deschanel as the leading lady in Yes Man ( I would say yes too ahem ) , because in my opinion she hasn't made a lot of films , and still has that refreshing appeal . If truth be told her Allison would be someone whom I'd sit up and take notice , because of her zest for life , and hey , here's someone multi-talented ( ok , that might be debatable ) , coupled with some of her really unorthodox activities that look like fun , and miles from what I am doing anyway . I thought Jim Carrey had a field day acting opposite her , and that chemistry probably rubbed off and made them look like a cute couple who are up to totally crazy antics when they're out on their dates . Based on the book by Danny Wallace , the turning point in the film , which tied up all the random elements pretty neatly for that push toward the final act , was well done and I couldn't help but to guffaw , that if I was in those shoes , I might be connecting the dots in the same manner and asking pointed questions as well . Along with a whole host of supporting cast ranging from Bradley Cooper as Carl's best friend Peter , Molly Sims as his ex-wife Stephanie and Rhys Darby in a hilarious role as his manager ( and major geek ) Norman , the soundtrack too serves as another highlight in the film , with songs mostly by Eels , and Zooey Deschanel herself lending her vocal chords to a number of songs here , where the lyrics are totally insane ( she has part writing credit for those ) which left me laughing out loud for the most parts . So while I see the cinematic ways as to how saying Yes could change one's life but only with the intervention of fated coincidences , I guess there's no harm trying and giving the same philosophy a shot , right ? So go ahead and say Yes together with me , but of course with some intelligence and common sense , and I'd expect all of us could hope to be in for some surprising change to our personal lives . And please say Yes too to sitting through the end credits - that little skate man idea looks totally awesome !
A Nutshell Review : Aeon Flux	For the uninitiated , Aeon Flux is based on the series of animated shorts from MTV . Set 400 years into the future , it tells of a surviving utopia of humans after a virus eradicated 99 % of the world's human population . The colony now live in a walled environment , under the leadership of the scientist who discovered the cure for the virus . But with any kind of leadership rule with some hinting of hanky-panky behind the scenes , there will always be that bunch of rebels ( like Star Wars , Matrix , etc ) ever ready to upset the status quo . Here , the Monicans ( as they are known ) are avenging those who have disappeared under mysterious circumstances , and like James Bond , have cool toys to accompany them on missions . Charlize Theron plays the Monican's top assassin known as Aeon Flux . And she is just about the best thing in the movie . Full of close ups on that pretty face , and long shots of those incredibly long limbs , Theron waltzes her way through the film with ease , given the character's sheer invulnerability and ability to subdue any opponent without breaking into sweat . She does a few wardrobe changes too ( drool ) , and her hair , now jet black , styled ever so beautifully at all times when she's kicking ass . The movie rehashes the usual sci-fi themes that have been beaten time and again , that of mortality , and the morality behind immortality . Probably I haven't watched the MTV shorts to understand more of Aeon Flux , but as a standalone movie , you sort of guessed its the usual " bad-to-clone-humans " storyline about one-third into the movie . By the time you're half way through , you would have guessed what's next on the agenda , and how it'll end . One sore point about Aeon Flux is the lack of a credible , strong villain . The baddies kinda lacked focus with its internal bitching , and double-crossing / switching sides so often , they make villains look so embarrassingly fickle minded about their cause . Most of the time though you'll only see lots of foot soldiers in ugly uniforms , dispatched like bowling pins . Also , I felt that the filmmakers sort of changed their minds about the ending - quite clear what had happened , and quite amazed at what happened thereafter ( Not wanting to spoil , just look out for a character ) . Given the film's length ( approx 90 minutes without end credits ) , very little is said about the abilities of the Monicans , except they make excellent assassins ( or at least Aeon is ) , with abilities that can be enhanced by changing some body ( spare ) parts . The cool thing that they have is the telepathy amongst the agents , as well as their Handler . Kiss goodbye to meeting rooms , where you can have ultra-cool meetings in your cerebral cortex instead . And that's where the special effects struck gold . Other than that , and the teleportation effects , for a movie set in the future , it looked relatively low-budgeted , if compared to contemporary sci-fi peers of recent times . One surprise I got was Pete Postlethwaite's appearance as the Keeper - I thought he looked quite funny in his costume , although his underused character played a pivotal role in the events that unfold . So except for hardcore Aeon fans , or admirers of Theron , this film could prove to be unappealing given its relatively weak sci-fi story as the backbone . Ooh , I must rave again , Theron looks absolutely gorgeous with her uber-chic hairdo and slinky black lycra .
A Nutshell Review : Yoshino's Barber Shop	In the village of Kaminoe , it's idyllic , quiet , everything looks quite normal . Except when you realize a quirky trait amongst the little boys - all of them are sporting this bowled hairstyle ! And I mean ALL the boys ! At first it looks quite cute , and the movie too , until suddenly , you start to question if this is something taken to the extreme . With the arrival of a new kid from the outside , sporting totally hip , dyed hair , herein lies the perfect catalyst for impending change , or is it ? On the surface , it may look like a children's story , with the group of boys befriending this new kid , and having a sort of peer effect on him to get his hairstyle changed to fit in , of course much to his reluctance . On the other hand , this individual's appearance in town made the boys rethink their norms of maintaining their hairstyles , no thanks to one of their moms , the matronly looking Yoshiko ( Masako Motai ) , whose barber shop dishes out the standard hairstyle for all the boys in the village . But like a recent Chinese movie Little Red Flowers , Yoshino's Barber Shop works at a deeper level as well . While children and folks not wishing to use their noodle can still enjoy the saccharine sweet storyline , episodes and admire the cinematography , those who wish to delve just a little bit deeper , will find a social commentary from writer-director Naoko Ogigami , on traditions and customs that we hold on too , despite their irrelevance in today's society . When questioned and challenged , those who hold these traditions dear , will nonetheless find it preposterous for someone else , especially from the younger generation , to question those customs . Sometimes when things are done in rote , or for the sake of doing , the rationales behind the festivals and tradition , will be lost in the hullabaloo of celebrations . At times the movie did feel a bit slow moving , but it provided the space for additional , deeper thoughts . The finale was complete with wicked , dark humour , but it addressed the desires of youth quite aptly , with their wanting to be cool , and innate streak of rebellion inside to always want to challenge the norms , as that equates to being cool . If you enjoy movies with kids playing the leads , then Yoshino's Barber Shop will rank up there with Little Red Flowers , in tackling similar adult themes in what seems to be a made for children's movie .
A Nutshell Review : Chandni Chowk to China	You can't deny the mystic appeal that Kung Fu films have on the masses . Not only has Hollywood managed to finally get the essence so succinctly and successfully infused it into the animated film Kung Fu Panda , and taking on one of China's icon as its own , India too has shown that it's no pushover now in combining its Bollywood " masala " formula with the martial arts genre , and does so too by snagging the iconic Gordon Liu as lead villain . It's been some time since Gordon Liu fought on screen , and one cannot forget the memorable 36th Chamber movies , amongst others in his filmography . Like Christopher Lee and Terence Stamp , I'm hoping that this sparks a comeback of sorts for the guy , because he still got what it takes to put young men to shame given his still buffed physique . As head villain Hojo , he's the typical gangster chief who's exploiting a group of villagers in plundering treasures of the land for sale to foreigners , earning good profits as well as dabbling in diamond smuggling , thanks to sidekick Meow Meow , played by Deepika Padukone . To those who oppose him , they're fatally dealt with the spinning bowler hat ! Deepika , like in her debut film Om Shanti Om , plays two roles here . Besides the villainous Meow Meow , the other role as Sakhi is a tele-media model who goes back to China in search of her roots , of paying respects to her family members presumed dead . Deepika carries her roles with aplomb , though between Sakhi and Meow Meow , I thought she would have more fun as the latter since she's given the chance to experiment with some wire-fu , and looks good in dishing out some martial arts moves , not to mention having a funkier wardrobe too . Small town cook to big time hero , that's Akshay Kumar's Sidhu , who's mistaken to be Liu Sheng , a fictional China folk hero and formidable warrior reincarnate . Given hope under false pretense by street-side fortune teller Chopstick ( Ranvir Shorey ) , he bids his guardian Dada ( Mithun Chakraborty ) farewell , before heading East to an incredible reception by the villagers who deem him the solution to their problems . Naturally he's in for some rude shock , disappointment and personal tragedy , before like all Kung Fu heroes , come bouncing back after some intense training . It has shades of Stephen Chow's Kung Fu Hustle especially with the cartoony aspects , as well as elements that were a throwback to the genre in the 70s and 80s , with a montage segment featuring his training under a sifu ( Roger Yuan ) , as well as finding out one's destiny and true self . Akshay's no stranger to action , and his martial arts background also helped in making that credible comeback for , what else , revenge . Given the standard two-half format for a Bollywood film , he spots a bit of a paunch when his Sidhu's a little idiotic , before physically crafting his body into an Iron Man . Chandni Chowk to China has everything - romance , melodrama , kung fu , high tech and fantasy gadgets , even a potato that looks like a god . It's pretty entertaining as a fusion of sorts , though not as funny as I thought it would be ( that training montage is still the funniest of the lot ) . And thank goodness that some attention was paid to diction in the Chinese language ( you know how some films tend to screw it up ) when spouted by non - native speakers . Song and dance segments weren't really memorable , except for the theme song for Sidhu ( so far , every Akshay Kumar film I've seen him in , has a song for his character ) . But for fans of Gordon Liu , this is one film you'd definitely not want to miss . And I'll be keeping an eye out for that sequel too !
A Nutshell Review : Floating Clouds	If you're looking for a movie that deals with clingy relationships , then Floating Clouds is without a doubt a movie that fits the bill to a T . Directed by Naruse Mikio and based upon the novel by Fumiko Hayashi , the female character in the movie will bring back memories of those who have had to deal with such stifling clinging , and well , for those who do act as such , a stark and accurate portrayal that would be akin to holding up a mirror and looking at oneself . Hideko Takamine put up a commendable , if not personally what I deem as a remarkably irritating performance as Yukiko Koda , a woman perhaps with little self-esteem and respect , who decided to sacrifice an entire forest for one singular tree . Being sent to Indochina during WWII , she chances upon Kengo Tomioka ( Masayuki Mori ) , and while he seemed to be prim and proper , and not giving her a second glance , soon they fall in love with each other , one despite having a wife back home , and the other , knowingly being the other woman . But when the war ends and they get repatriated back to Japan , she looks him up , only to discover that he will not leave his wife , nor to rekindle their passion started in a foreign land . To make things worse , she discovers he's quite the cad , and to compound the problem , her insecurities and her paranoia makes you wonder why she can't afford to sever ties . It's one thing being made to suffer from unrequited love , but it's another if you are made to suffer deliberately , and bear witness to the insincerity of the other party . Running slightly over 2 hours , it does take its time to showcase the sorry state that Yukiko undergoes . You can't really find fault with Naruse Mikio's direction of the movie - the handling of the narrative structure in the first act was deft , with the transition of time seamless , and the actors do their job to allow you to connect with their characters . However , like I mentioned , perhaps Yukiko Koda did such a fine job , that for me I found her to be a tad too irritating , even for my liking .
A Nutshell Review : The Banquet	It's an oriental kung fu Hamlet . Everyone's been saying it's loosely based on Shakespeare's tragedy , and to some , the movie's indeed a tragedy with its slowness in pace and lack of action , but I'd like to see it as because of its heavy reference to Hamlet ( the poisoned quill , and many other plot points and scenes ) , it sort of created a crutch on which to lean the movie upon , hence the familiarity to some , therefore having the source serving as a double edged sword - the movie beholden to it and eventually ending it on a weak note . Having inherited the creative team of Yuen Wo Ping ( action choreography ) , Tan Dun ( Music ) , Tim Yip ( Art Direction ) , and the starlet in Ziyi Zhang ( wonder why the westernized juxtaposition of her name ) does not automatically replicate the success of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon that easily . It's the X-factor and the blending of elements of novelty in CTHD that made it a huge success , and blindly following the predetermined formula is akin to hammering a square peg into a round hole . While the art direction is lush and everything looking adequately regal , somehow Tan Dun's music seemed to be muted throughout the movie , only exhibiting sporadic brilliance to drum up scenes with the soundtrack , or the hauntingly beautiful theme song . The major disappointment however , will be in the fighting scenes . Here , martial arts both function as a contrast to the much muted artsy style of the Hamlet here , Prince Wu Luan ( Daniel Wu ) , highlighting the difference in power between the pen and the sword , as well as functioning as foreplay . I thought with the gratuitous fake blood spewing across the screen , it was kind of a homage to 70s Shaw Bros martial arts classics , and a nod to director Chang Cheh , the king of ketchup blood . The initial big sequenced battle scene might have whet appetites , but sadly subsequent battles do not match up , with its repetitive running up walls or in mid air , as if Yuen had run out of tricks in the wire-work manual , having at one point seemed to copy Tsui Hark's Dao ( 1995 ) . There's one moment of innovation though in a scene of punishment not seen ( at least to me ) before . But not that I'm complaining . If this martial arts in this movie is viewed without comparisons to other more recent fantasy martial arts movies like Hero and House of Flying Daggers , it is still enjoyable and beautifully choreographed , and surpasses The Promise by a huge mile . Just that it lacked a fresh look in battles , and the unimaginative costuming of the Imperial Guards didn't help , looking too close like distant cousins of Lord of the Ring's Nazguls / Ringwraiths / Black Riders . Desire as a theme runs through the movie very strongly , the desire for love , endless power and pure , unadulterated revenge . Very briefly , the story by now will be fairly obvious with Emperor Li ( Ge You ) usurping the throne from his brother , and coverts his wife Empress Wan as his own , who at one point in time was Prince Wu Luan's old flame . The Prince here is a fellow in love with the arts and bent on avenging his father , and who is the subject of unrequited love by the daughter of a minister - Qing Nu ( Zhou Xun ) . It's all about the wearing of masks and the building of facades , of hiding true intentions to achieve personal objectives . The contrast between the two men in the Emperor and the Prince is looked into , their love lives examined - one who uses power to obtain love , while the other's fortune to be loved brought him unimaginable influence . Despite its references to Hamlet , the focus of the movie here seemed to be Ziyi Zhang's Empress Wan , as she plots and schemes , leaving you perplexed as to whether to sympathize and pity her , or applaud her attempts at exacting her own brand of justice . Acting all round is nothing to rave about , and though Ge You's performance seemed the better of the lot , his measured , subtle ways as the Emperor comes off rather weakly as a man capable of scheming to get to where he is . Somehow , I thought that Hamlet allowed the acting to take a foot off the pedal as audiences would already put in place perceptions and direct translations of character for character . All said , The Banquet is still a reasonably competent foray into the martial arts genre for director Feng Xiaogang , and if he were to put another movie from the genre out , I'll sure be there to watch it . Now to anticipate Zhang Yimou's next contribution to the genre .
A Nutshell Review : The Unseeable	It's no secret that I'm a fan of writer-director Wisit Sasanatieng's movies - Tears of the Black Tiger , and Citizen Dog . What's excellent and probably the hallmarks of the director currently are the stunning visuals , wonderful colors , and story lines which are highly imaginative . With Tears , it was an amalgam of cultures for a distinctive and eclectic mix of what's Thai , and the Wild Wild West . In Citizen Dog , the fusion of fantastical elements , song , and comedy endears it and at the same time , warms your heart . But when this project was announced , I admit I was a bit apprehensive . I have not fancied many Asian horror movies of late , because of the usual formulaic stories and the employment of cheap shock tactics which bore . At times , scenes become unintentionally comedic , coupled with bad makeup and cheesy special effects , which mar whatever potential the movies could have achieved . The horror genre is no doubt a money spinner , and many times , quality is compromised when everyone jumps on the same bandwagon , knowing audiences will still lap them up despite the inferior product . The Unseeable , however , managed to evade the negative connotations as put forth . I guess my trust in Sasanatieng's vision remained unwavering . The story , when finally pieced together , remained coherent , even though at some points , it felt that the pacing could be picked up a little . Never rushed , it took a very measured method to introduce characters , their backgrounds , and the explanation of , well , what goes bump in the night . The story tells of a pregnant village girl , Nualjan , who left her hometown in search of her lost husband . En route to Bangkok , she gets put up at a boarding house , with few inhabitants , and owned by a mysterious rich widow Ranjuan who lives in a separate house in the same compound . Making few friends , and slowly becoming the disdain of the housekeeper , Nualjan encounters inexplainable incidents and strange folks , helped in no way by stories about the spookiness of the premises . The usual motley crew of horror movie characters - an old scrawny lady , a young child , and plenty of shadowy figures . The narrative structure did seem to stick to the usual formula though , with the final twist ending ( twist endings themselves are becoming so common , it's difficult for filmmakers to imagine something more breakthrough ) . At times , you will also feel that despite the red herrings , your gut feel about how things will turn out , will probably correct . While the revelation explained and tied up loose ends , it did however demonstrate that it doesn't seem to want to end . Gone are the usual bright pastel color palette that we associate Sasanatieng's movies with , and in place for The Unseeable , are strained colors with a general greenish tinge , in line with the mood and atmosphere created for horror . I felt the filmmakers achieved their objective of creating a horror movie which doesn't capitalize on CGI and special effects , that if not done right , relegates it automatically together with those of dubious quality . Relying on tight angles and excellent sound editing , I admit that yes , watching The Unseeable did give me the chills , especially during its revelatory scenes . I believed the movie's title in Thai was a little spoiler in itself , so please don't try to translate it until after you've seen the movie . My faith in Wisit Sasanatieng continues , and I for one am eagerly anticipating his take on the martial arts genre with Armful , currently in production .
A Nutshell Review : Kamome Diner ( Kamome Shokudo )	This is Naoko Ogigami's third feature film , and the first Japanese film to be shot entirely in Finland , land of the midnight sun . As I mentioned in some other postings , cinema allows you to be transported to fantasy worlds , and of course in a more realistic sense , going to countries we have yet to set foot upon . The movie is set around a Japanese diner in Finland , and its owner , Sachie ( Satomi Kobayashi ) . The story revolves around the diner , as well as the friendships that Sachie develops , with customer and crew . The food , " soul foods " as in the menu , can make anyone salivate and feel hunger pangs , especially when the movie was screened into dinner time . Pretty nothing much happens in Kamome Diner , except that there are plenty of people flitting in and out of the eatery . It's like watching a television series with episodes strung together , each putting the focus and theme on guest characters of the show , how they interact with the established leads . We are introduced to Sachie's first customer , a Finnish teenager who enjoys Japanese anime , and from there , one thing leads to another , as Sachie meets up with Midori ( Hairi Katagiri ) , also another Japanese who left Japan to seek her fortunes in a strange land . The customers in the diner is set up in the story such that it's directly proportionate to the friendships established by Sachie . It's like a vicious circle being broken , with the seizing of opportunities and the chance of befriending a customer , comes the breaking down of hesitation that others have about something that is new , something less seen , something different . And as it grows , so too does the number of friendships being formed , nurtured and developed , akin to the care put into the creation of recipes and the cooking of food . By the end of it , everyone had undergone changes in their lives for the better , through subtle interactions , lessons learnt , and all these in a rather mundane manner of living life , in normal day to day activities . The cast is a mix of Japanese and Finnish , and the dialogue too a mix of languages . But given its themes of friendship , belief , keeping the faith and being positive just about everything , it's ultimately a feel good movie , with plenty of subtleties , a dash of humour , and generous servings of well intentions .
A Nutshell Review : Yasukuni	I guess topics which are taboo , or films that have their bans lifted , will more than likely have its audience base automatically built from the curiosity arising from its background , wondering on what grounds and rationale that such a film got made or banned in the first place . The Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo had its fair share of publicity coming from ex Japanese prime minister Koizumi's high profile visits to the shrine for worship , much to the disgust of neighbours China and Korea , because enshrined within those grounds , are some of the tried war criminals of WWII , whom to most in Asia , are not deemed to be martyrs , having started a campaign on aggression in the region . Depending on which camp you're standing in , there are two sides of the coin even from within a homogeneous society like Japan itself ? those who find it no big deal for their prime minister to visit the shrine at his own personal capacity , and those who find it wrong to do so . On a macro level , while it is easy to condemn those who partook in the war , from personal stories just like that in any society , there will always be those who have to do it against their will , and even some touching stories coming from the surviving siblings that their brothers get sent away , being quite clear that they'll never come back ever again . As a documentary , there is no lack of an educational value in it . There were plenty of nuggets of information for the military history buffs , and some of the things I learnt , was how Yasukuni itself has so much importance and relevance to Imperial Japan . For starters , I learnt that swords have an indelible connection to the army and to the shrine , given that sword forgers from the shrine made their swords on those very grounds , and officers at the frontline are bestowed one each . This equates to quality swords running in the thousands being made . Of course , these swords are infamous for being tools used to behead countless of victims , and some of these atrocities get publicized as bravery contests amongst officers . And the significance of the sword is so important , that within the shrine , the object of worship is none other than one Yasukuni sword which is used to represent the more than 2 million souls who were lost in the war , fighting for the Emperor , which of course amongst that figure , things are not all that clear , with various groups lobbying for things such as removal of names and enshrining of their ancestors , because they were either forced to conscript , or some aren't even Japanese to begin with . It's hard to imagine ? 2 millions souls ? captured into one single sword , and if this was a martial arts world we live in , that would be one heck of a powerful sword . But as a movie , there were a lot more to be desired . Granted when dealing with topics of controversy , answers during interviews are not bound to be forthcoming , given the director's attempt to elicit some candid remarks from the sole remaining Yasukuni sword forger who's already into his 90s . Interviews with his subjects also seem to be more from the man on the street , and thus dilutes some of the expected quality in the answers , which some might allude to talk that you'll hear from coffeeshops , some of which might be entertaining for its point blank accusations , such as the British National Museum being a storage space for goods plundered all over the world . I chuckled at this comment because this is not the first time I'm hearing it , as I've heard it before from a Brit on a tour telling all tourists that same thing as well ( he's a tour guide by the way ) . Most of the time , the camera lingers in and around the grounds of the shrine on August 15 , since it's the day designated as a remembrance , and you have various military groups coming on site to pay their respects , as will other civil groups and protesters as well , thus making it fertile grounds for opposing members of the groups to come into blows , verbally or physically , in trying to force their viewpoints on the other . One thing's for sure though , that groups are passionate in their beliefs , and no words get minced in their shout-outs . However , the film doesn't go beyond what's shown on the surface . It seems quite contented in capturing events of the day , like a newsreel , but without any further input on how and why such events , shots and the inclusion of such scenes mattered . There was an extended scene involving an American who was flag waving ( the stars and stripes ) on the grounds to mixed reactions from the Japanese people , as well as dwelling on incidents such as the Taiwanese indigenous groups wanting to reclaim the souls of their ancestors . But alas further interviews to pick the minds of these folks were not done ? maybe the request to interview them was unsuccessful ? So while it had some ingredients to make it more than worthwhile to sit through 2 hours of a film revolving around the Yasukuni shrine and movement , its presentation could have been a lot stronger . The narrative got quite messy and all over the place , never having a primary focus , but flitted around as and when it found convenience . I felt the ending was rather week because of its reliance on commonly seen archival stock images and videos , but on the whole , an impressive effort and courage to explore something controversial and touchy even until today .
A Nutshell Review : ( SIFF ) We Feed the World	So I begin my selection of this year's SIFF with a documentary . Directed by Erwin Wagenhofer , We Feed the World begins by highlighting a very fundamental wastage . That of overnight bread , tons of it being offloaded , meant for the incinerated , when there are thousands left hungry . The documentary focuses on various aspects on the supply side of the food chain , giving some insight to the various industries which produce food , like fishing , vegetables and poultry . It also provides a glimpse into the political side of supplying food , that of the profit maximization strategy of any public company ( here , it's Nestle ) , of the genetically modified seeds which supposedly produces superior crop as opposed to better tasting , natural ones , and various EU plans and initiatives which seem to go down the wrong path instead of fulfilling its supposedly planned objectives . While it covers a lot of ground , some segments proved to be a little draggy and preachy . I particularly enjoyed the segment on the fishing industry , where there are plans to wrest knowledge from the small timers operating smaller fishing operations , and to eventually merge / close them down when the bigger boys come into the picture . As demonstrated in the movie , there are reasons why big trawlers doesn't equate to fresher and better catches . The other segment which moved was on the Brazilian's poor north-eastern parts , where on one hand , you have very poor people going hungry all the time , yet Brazil's one of the major exporters of maize to Europe . Maize which are used for burning for fuel generation . It just boggles the mind , and makes you feel sad at the way things work , illogical as it may seem , in the name of profit - watching the kids drink untreated murky water , and the adults resorting to unnatural means of keeping their children alive , will gloom your day . And I could have swore off chicken come the final segment . Nowadays lifestock are treated as an 8-week cycle of a production line , from incubating , hatching , fattening , until the final days of slaughtering , where they're hung upside down by the legs in conveyor belts , before passing through a circular bladed discs where their throats are slit , and left bleeding till death . For those which are missed by the blades , there is a butcher on standby with a knife to do the deed . But while the movie tried to made its points , what I found lacking are the many ways in which to link the message to the issues . Many times it felt a little sporadic , or the linking done quite weakly through intertitles . That aside , perhaps I'm already attuned to the more in-your-face style of Michael Moore , nevermind if there are echoes that his style is manipulative . For a topic like this , perhaps it could gain from that bit of controversy to hammer its opinions through .
A Nutshell Review : Khastegi	If living a life as a transsexual is difficult enough as it is , with the grappling of social prejudices and the likes , imagine if one happens to be a transsexual in a closed society , how torturous that would be given low tolerance for anything deemed out of the ordinary . Directed by Bahman Motamedian , this Iranian movie explores the lives and times of seven real life transsexuals in Tehran , where we hear the life stories of the protagonists in real terms , having to enact those dark moments in their lives themselves , and be brutally honest about it , taking on the system straight at its horns . While this remains a dramatic narrative film , it plays out more like a pseudo-documentary with talking heads , where the story is interspersed at appropriate moments where the person in question would come on , and talk about their experience . To most , it's a perversion that brings shame to their families , but to themselves , they see it nothing more as a disorder that they have to come to terms with , whether society frowns upon them or not . You can imagine the mountain to climb when they have to deal with the authorities with regards to their identities , being dressed entirely differently from their gender stated in official documents . They can subject to constant ridicule and face prejudice from all walks of life in society and worse , from their own family members . In the workplace , they find difficulty in getting gainful employment . But if you take a step back , they too share the same loves and fears that every human being do . Our need for acceptance and love from family , friends and a significant other if you're lucky , facing doubts , uncertainties and fears in our lives , but all the more amplified in their instance especially so when you're brought up and live in a strict closed society , where becoming a woman means to lose your rights and freedom . Situations can become extreme and desperate , and I'd consider it desperate if one has to contemplate selling one's organs in order to raise money to undergo an operation . But you cannot deny the inner strength that they have , and the ingenuity in coming up with smart , witty retorts to shut people up . Just as how the AFFF Festival Director Sanjoy K Roy had said in his address in the programme notes that films open our eyes to some things which we have no access to , Khastegi chronicles and documents the struggles of transsexuals , and in the light of that struggle , comes positive vibes in their courage for independence despite what others might think .
A Nutshell Review : ( DVD ) Samurai Fiction ( 1998 )	Style and Substance . That's what Samurai Fiction is about . I was surprised at the many MTV-ish stylistic shots incorporated into the movie , without a blatant disregard for the storyline , incorporating very modern rock into its soundtrack . The Inukai clan had their family sword stolen by a renegade samurai Rannosuke Kazamatsuri . Swearing to get it back , Heishiro Inukai embarks on a journey to hunt down Kazamatsuri . However , his skills are no match for a seasoned warrior who has killed many , and almost had his life ended until he is saved by a hermit Hanbei Mizoguchi . It's a tale of 3 very diverse samurais , each carrying a theme . The peaceful Hanbei Mizoguchi , highly skilled , but abhors the use of violence . The cool and violent killer without remorse Rannosuke Kazamatsuri , who becomes obsessed with challenging Hanbei to a duel . The inept Heishiro Inukai , who defies his father's wishes to embark on a solo quest to regain their family honour . Thrown into the fray are 2 ninjas on a quest to protect Heishiro and carry out his family's orders on his behalf , and Koharu Mizoguchi , the adopted daughter of Hanbei , with whom Heishiro falls in love with . The storyline might be pretty ordinary , on one end , the revenge theme , the other , love and peace . But I suppose these are themes that are quite universal , especially in martial arts stories . The fights are all done very simply . Stylish , but kept uncluttered . Shot in black and white , colours are used sparingly , except for the coating of entire frames in red when someone gets killed . You don't see blood , but you see plenty of varying shots and angles of the fight sequences , done mostly with the help of a crane . What works for me are the comedic characters like Heishiro's friends , early in the beginning , in their run up ( pardon the pun ) to catching Kazamatsuri . Also , the soundtrack is totally awesome , unlike the use of traditional music to spice up the fights . You might also know that Ronnosuke Kazamatsuri is played by real life rocker Tomoyasu Hotei , who also did that excellent track Battle Without Honor or Humanity , used in the Kill Bill Vol 1 movie . It's weird to notice that this movie is actually billed as Episode 1 . It's been 8 years and I'm not aware of a sequel or continuation in place . But I guess Samurai Fiction has already told the story it wants to tell , and there shouldn't be a need for a follow up . Code 1 DVD contains the movie and a making of documentary , and a separate disc containing bloopers , cast biographies , how two scenes actually looked in colour , the trailers , and an entire 1 hour feature on the making of the Samurai Fiction , which showed that a simple movie also has its fair share of difficulties , and Mother Nature did its best to stall production .
A Nutshell Review : Forgetting Sarah Marshall	Written by and starring a very naked Jason Segel , I thought this film would be incredibly easy to identify with , given that it dealt with a man who didn't see his breakup with his hot girlfriend coming in close on the horizon , until the very last minute . Starring as musician Peter Bretter , his relationship with the titular Sarah Marshall ( Kristen Bell ) came to an unexpected end with her cheating on him and moving on with new beau , rocker Aldous Snow ( Russell Brand ) . And for the most parts initially , it was easy to identify with , really , what with his failure to accept reality , and his brooding and incessant whining to friends and family , which are primarily set up for laughs . But the best bits of the comedic aspects of the story were included in the trailer , leaving only but the bland and tired one liners in the movie that failed to elicit laughter . You can almost predict how scenes are engineered toward a certain punchline , and that expectation drew away any semblance of a genuine ha-ha . The usual pop cultural references were just there , but gone are the honestly sincere approach at making a mickey out of them . So what did Forgetting Sarah Marshall really get at ? It was actually more of a classic romantic story instead , and brings to the screen very vividly , relationship challenges and issues in today's world , coupled with basic bugbears like Expectations . In a Hawaii getaway , nothing's worse than spending a vacation alone in a romantic location and bumping into your ex with her new beau in tow , living in the , horrors , next room . But Peter's luck took a change with the opportunity presented in a pretty hotel staff Rachel Jansen ( Mila Kunis ) , who in movie land would be single and available and just about finds him attractive in a certain way too . So here the dynamics get set up as we play observers to two pairs of relationships in parallel - one where sex rules above all , the other just budding with almost everything being fine and dandy . Until of course one looks back constantly over the shoulder at what was , and almost always start to appreciate things that once were . While it's always easy to do that and mope , it takes a lot of strength to be able to say no , and move on . We take comfort in the things tried and tested and sometimes lack the courage to venture out and take on life's challenges head on , but have to realize that moments that are past should stay buried in the past , and not forgo and give up opportunities to start afresh . And when you do , treasure it , and not be a dick . What I truly enjoyed in the movie , is how perceptions of oneself are likely to be skewed , where in many scenes we may sympathize with certain characters for being receiving the short end of the stick . But like how it takes two hands to clap , we're also presented the larger picture through revealing flashbacks , and realize that hey , sometimes we are selfish to always think about ME , and fail to see things from the other person's perspective , especially of loved ones whom we tend to lapse into taking for granted . Never mind if supporting cast from the Apatow Clan like Paul Rudd and Jonah Hill are here to lend comedic support to the film . Forgetting Sarah Marshall triumphs for its earnest reminder about the basic things that make a relationship , and the easiest ways to break one stemming from complacency and the lack of honesty .
A Nutshell Review : Il Grido	For those who've been attending the Retrospective religiously , one of the best bits during the screening is the introduction to each movie as presented by Lorenzo Codelli , where he shares some little known facts of the movie with the audience . Today we were told that Monica Vitti actually was featured in Il Grido , not in person though but providing the dubbed voice behind Dorian Gray's character Virginia . So their collaboration stretched further back , even before L'Avventura . The story centers on a working class sugar refinery worker Aldo ( American actor Steve Cochran ) who we learn has waited for 7 years cohabiting with Irma ( Alida Valli ) , whose husband had recently passed away while in Australia . Thinking that this is a blessing in disguise in that he can finally marry Irma , Aldo gets the biggest surprise when he learns that the love of his life had in the last 4 months , given her heart to someone else . In rage he dished out unforgivable physical violence in public on her , and with a broken heart , picks up his daughter Rosina ( Mima Girardi ) to embark on an aimless road trip , wandering all over Po valley ( which was the subject of one of Antonioni's early documentary ) . Shot in the great outdoors , there's always a lingering mist in the first half of the movie , as if to accentuate Aldo's state of uncertainty and blur in his current state of life , without a clue what lies ahead as he drifts from location to location , and from person to person , as if like a person on a rebound , latching onto every opportunity that present itself to him , but all this while having absolutely no plans and unsure of what to do . While he seeks out his first love Elvia ( Betsy Blair ) and there comes this speed boat race , I thought Il Grido really picks up when he wanders toward a highway petrol kiosk , and meets with Virginia ( Dorian Gray ) and her alcoholic aged father ( played by Guerrino Campanini ) . Romancing the lady boss for food and lodging , having his daughter at his side demonstrated in truth that his relationship with and welfare for his daughter takes precedence over everything else , so while on the surface he might seem aimless , deep down he still bears a sense of responsibility to provide for Rosina , which probably gave him an invisible guiding hand in what he was doing , until of course he clinically evaluated and decided otherwise . As he goes from woman to woman , having short temporal relationships with everyone we see on screen from Elvia to Andreina ( Lynn Shaw ) , each played out like small skits , but a common thread running through it is that the characters here seem to be people who have wasted away their prime , missed the boat and are holding out for one last possibility at true love and happiness . Irma found hers although at Aldo's expense , and everyone else demonstrated memories with loved ones whom they cannot forget . The ending is nothing less than heart - wrenching , a discovery and affirmation of sad truths when people indeed have moved on , but then you realize that insofar you're still stuck in a rut . Very depressing if you ponder over it . The last act also dwelt on impending change , with landscape changes ordered from the top , with common people on the ground being forced to accept these changes , with little regard to their livelihood . I thought it provided a poignant moment to reflect upon such frenzy , and sometimes the insensitivity that comes together with forced policies probably , and hopefully for the greater good .
A Nutshell Review : ( DVD ) Marie Antoinette ( 2006 )	Sofia Coppola takes on a historical character in Marie Antoinette , providing her own vision of the doomed Queen of France and the French Monarchy under the reign of Louis XVI , based upon the biography written by Antonia Fraser . Kirsten Dunst , whom we ever so often remember with red hair for her Mary Jane Watson roles in the Spider-Man series , plays the titular role , bringing forth girly innocence , frustration and strength as her character develops through the course of the movie . Sofia Coppola clearly made this movie focused on events from her point of view , covering major incidents and happenings in her life . I thought the first half of the movie was excellent , where Marie gets married to the Dauphin of France Louis XVI , a marriage of strategic importance to seal the Austrian and French alliance , but one which seems to be stuck in the ruts because of incompatibility . She likes theatre , he's into hunting . She's into fashion , and he's into locks and keys . Consummating their marriage is a problem , and remains a major obstacle and puts constant strain on Marie Antoinette , because without producing an heir to the throne , her position in the court is always precarious , not to mention , without influence to further advance Austrian interest . But don't forget , she's but a teenager , and Sofia Coppola never fails to remind us of that - the difficulty of a young one living within the constricting protocols of a monarchy . And not to mention under public scrutiny all the time . Although a period movie , Coppola managed to bring forth the issues faced into current time , since the themes and events explored are quite similar to the contemporary era . The bitching , the rumour mongering , and the superficial small talk of people of perceived importance are nothing new in this day and age , and Marie more often than not is the favourite subject for the tabloids . It's not all sympathetic to the character though , as her vices like gambling , drinking and rumoured dalliances with Count Fersen in her holiday home of Petit Trianon are played out , together with her rather callous attitude toward what was happening to the commonfolk . While politics is rarely touched upon , the portrayal of the King's handling of foreign policy for face rather than taking care of his subjects is probably one of the fundamental contributing factor to its downfall , and France is shown to be slowly bankrupted while sending aid to American for the revolutionaries to fight against the British , unaware of growing resentment in home soil . The second half felt more of a rush job , with Marie's spiral into unpopularity with her perceived extravagant decadence . It's a reminder of how someone's image can be greatly tainted by uncorrected , vicious rumours , and when the power of the people is at full force , you can't help but submit when all is lost . Some have questioned why the movie didn't pursue all the way until the final demise of Marie Antoinette , but frankly , looking at the film's treatment of the character , there's actually no need to , and all in all , quite a balanced presentation on how an historical character is brought to life on screen . With beautiful costumes , rich colours , and sets based within the actual Palace of the Versailles , it's a pity that this movie did not make it to our local screens , and I believe watching it on the big screen will make all the difference . For those who want to take a look at the much talked about easter egg in the movie , the Converse shoes are shown at the 55 : 48 mark .
A Nutshell Review : Charlotte's Web	I had initial hesitation in deciding whether to watch this movie - not because it features a talking pig ala Babe , but probably because , if rumour has you believe , that viewers will swear off pork . They look so cute that you would not imagine them being on your dinner table , ever after . I've read the book when I was a kid , but heck , I can't remember much of the details beyond the friendship between spider and pig . Wilbur the piglet's destiny is set from birth - being the odd one out without access to its mother's teat , he's earmarked for immediate transformation to pork , but the intervention of a young girl Fern ( Dakota Fanning ) helped prevent it , albeit for a little while . Put in a barn with the other animals , Wilbur is in desperate need of friendship to wilt away his loneliness , but given the indifferent attitudes amongst the resident animals , he gets a none too friendly introduction to farm life . That is until he meets Charlotte , a spider who will try help to extend the lifespan of Wilbur , saving the spring pig from becoming Christmas ham . It's a story about friendship , and the miracles gained from trust , help , and the fulfilling of promises . And this movie gets a huge boost through its A-list voice talents , with the likes of , check this out - Julia Roberts as Charlotte , Steve Buscemi as Templeton the selfish rat , John Cleese as Sam Sheep , leader of the pack of sheep followers ( played to hilarity ) , Katy Bates , Cedric the Entertainer , Oprah Winfrey , Robert Redford , Thomas Haden Church , Andre Benjamin and Sam Shepard . They seemed to have a rip-roaring time , and I thought Julia Roberts ' Charlotte came across as extremely calm and collected , while probably the character with the best lines was Templeton the rat . Fanning already got experience playing opposite her animal counterparts , like in Dreamer earlier this year , though this time in the barnyard the animals are enhanced by technology and graphics . Her role however is limited in screen time , and although there are hints on puppy love , it's very much unexplored in depth as the focus is squarely on our animal friends . The score is an unrecognizable Danny Elfman contribution without the dark overtones , and the songs played during the animated stills of the end credits , do sound radio friendly enough to warrant airplay . Charlotte's Web is a feel good , heartwarming family movie which is suitable for this holiday season . It is uncomplicated , and has a simple message , but is engaging enough for both children and adults . A warning though , the movie is poignant yet hopeful , so to sentimental folks , a tissue or two will help .
A Nutshell Review : The King	No , this movie is not a sequel to The Queen , and it's peculiar to have both The King and The Queen making their screenings at our theatres at the same time . If given a choice to make , I would recommend The King instead . This movie reminded me of Woody Allen's Matchpoint . Different stories altogether , but with the general sense and feeling of incredible luck , and evilness amongst man . You can't help but wonder that each one of us have the propensity to do evil , and just what might exactly push our button to commit sin . Lust , revenge , and pride clearly on display in James Marsh's The King . There are various Kings here , the first which is most obvious , the main protagonist's name Elvis Valderez , played by Gael Garcia Bernal . Recently discharged from the Navy , he's on a trip to Texas to look up the father he never knew , who turned out to be a pastor , clearly already having moved on from his mother . The other notable King here , is pertaining to religion , given that Jesus Christ is acknowledged by Christians to be the King of Kings . I thought William Hurt put up a credible performance as the strict Pastor David Sandow , who now serves a little community , with possibly a happy family befitting a good Christian family . And perchance it is the ghost from the past , his illegitimate son Elvis , who's now the devil in his midst of them , slowly bringing down the facade and hypocrisy surrounding the Sandows , and exposing them for who they truly are . It's quite a dark movie , and made possible so as the devil has an innocent , possibly angelic face ( thanks to Gael ) , and little do you know the kind of evil that lurks around . Which probably makes it all the more dangerous as the saying goes , you know the person , but not what is in his heart - the motives , if ulterior . Having to say more will most likely spoil the entire movie . I liked the pacing that the story took , on having it all laid out methodically . At times , you question Elvis ' intent , if he's truly aware of the repercussions of what he's doing . You might want to argue that love knows no bounds , but there certainly are some clear markers and blinkers to warn you to stay away , at all costs . The great acting makes The King extremely watchable . William Hurt , as already mentioned , plays his pained pastor with plenty of skeletons in his closet , to a T . Pell James as his daughter Malerie , brings about a fresh faced ingénue to her role , with innocence written all over . For fans of Little Miss Sunshine , Paul Dano has more lines of dialogue here , and even exercises his vocal cords in singing two songs . His role as son Paul is contrasted against Elvis the illegitimate son - one devoted to God , the other the devil himself , one living his life with a cause , the other living his without any aim , except probably to groove along waiting for acceptance . There are many releases this week ( last count was nine ) , but The King ranks up there amongst the much watch .
A Nutshell Review : Apollo 13 : To the Edge and Back	If you're game to revisit the Apollo 13 mission and want to do away with the dramatics of the Ron Howard version , then perhaps this documentary would be what you're looking for . It doesn't come with a lot of bells and whistles , relying instead on plenty of stock footage and CG graphics to enhance the narrative in explaining what the astronauts Jim Lovell , Fred Haise and Jack Swigert had to go through when they're seemingly trouble-free mission turned out to be something quite unexpected , relying on the smarts of everyone from the lunar capsule right down to mission control to pull them out of their predicament . It doesn't just focus on the mission itself , but at appropriate times branches off to provide the viewer with a more holistic view of the entire 60s space race between the USA and USSR , with the latter gaining plenty of one-ups against their rival , until unexpected tragedies forced a quiet shutdown of their lunar program , with JFK pushing the lunar objective through to NASA . We also get to see some of the failed attempts of the USA's with their rockets going anywhere but skywards , and you wonder just how massive each space program was in trying to get mankind lifted off from Earth . It doesn't get any better than this with the real life astronauts and mission control crew providing first hand account of that mission which some of the superstitious had a field day with , given the 13th mission of the Apollo program , which blasted off on the 13th of April , at the time of 1313 hrs . That aside , the documentary by Noel Buckner and Rob Whittlesey is presented quite matter-of-factly with talking head interviews with the Jim Lovell , Fred Haise , and many more from ground control , including their rival Cosmonauts where you realize that on an individual level , it's about the triumph of man over which country being able to get bragging rights . On a National level , yes it boils down to being ahead , but for those involved and on the ground , whatever progress has been made , is a triumph in itself , and every tragedy reverberating through the space community . And yes , that infamous duct tape solution also gets mentioned here , although not in more details that I would have preferred . So if your preference is more for the dramatic flair provided by actors , then you just might want to stick to the Ron Howard version . Otherwise for a very succinct overview of the challenges faced in the mission , then this documentary account would be right up your alley .
A Nutshell Review : Battle of Wits ( Muk Gong )	The warring states of Ancient China serve as a backdrop for this pan-Asian war epic , starring the charismatic Andy Lau . Going by the literal translation of the Chinese title , it's " Ink War " , alluding to the fact that much of the battles in this movie relies a lot more on superior strategy in order to overcome a mammoth battle against a Goliath , with a 4 , 000 population up against the might of a 100 , 000 strong well-trained army . Based on a Japanese novel / manga Bokkou , Battle of Wits fictionalizes one of the episodes during 370BC , where China was still divided , and each nation seizing opportunities to usurp the other . Those familiar with history will know that eventually , the kingdom of Qin will ultimately unite the Middle Kingdom for the first time . However , the story sets its sights on the Kingdom of Zhao leading an attack on the smaller state of Liang . In its defence lies a mysterious man from the Mozhi tribe known as Ge Li ( Andy Lau of course ) , who galvanizes Liang's population to stage a stand against what seemingly looks like impossible odds . While war movies of long , long time ago have been flogged to death recently by Hollywood , with films like Alexander , Troy , and fantasy epics like the Lord of the Rings series , Asian movies have rarely scratched the surface until of late , with Battle of Wits leading the charge , and coming right up are at least two film adaptations of episodes from the Romance of the Three Kingdom novels . For those expecting fantastical and romanticized wu-xia martial arts moves , you will be disappointed , as this movie is rooted much in reality . Given the epic scale of this production , it still rings a sense of familiarity in its war scenes , and I thought that shooting most of them in middle-close range , loses much of its grandeur . The big spectacles shown have nothing new that will take your breath away , especially after Hollywood has plundered such productions . Nonetheless it augurs well that Battle of Wits managed to pull off a production of this nature , and has , surprise , a competent storyline to carry it through . There is a strong anti-war message that got worn on the sleeves Ge Li , as smart and cunning as he is , he's the reluctant hero , willing to make sacrifices for the greater good . He finds no pleasure in war , nor killings , but in order to save the masses , he must do what he has to thwart efforts of bloodthirsty kingdoms . He's is the message of " loving thy enemy " , naturally not shared by the incompetent leadership in Liang . And since time immemorial , you always have the incompetents possessing the heart of insolence , with characters of sloth and ill intentions , straddling from a high horse . Inept leaders silencing their opposition through calls of treason is a tactic all too familiar , which makes it all the more despondent as you ponder about that aged old Chinese proverb about there being nothing wrong in looking after your personal interests first , instead of bothering with the affairs of others . Ge Li faces both the task of winning over the people's trust ( since they're committing the state's defences to his organization ) , and the inevitable unappreciative , thankless task of having to do just that . As I mentioned , do not expect to see " Qing Gong " or fancy swordplay . Rather I was in awe with the delivery of strategies and counter strategies in having two warring factions pitting their wits against each other . Sometimes they come rather unexpectedly , and will leave you with a smile , like when you're wondering just what everyone is up to when they close their eyes en masse . Accompanied by an excellent soundtrack , the movie could be split down two halves , and while the first centered on the macro affairs , a more micro , personal affairs of the heart managed to creep in between Ge Li and Yi Yue ( the gorgeous Fan Bingbing ) , a calvary officer , and though their romance sometimes stalled the pace of the movie , it added some gravitas to Ge Li the Man , questioning his strong beliefs on being unselfish , and made the finale all the more heart-wrenching to watch . Featuring stars like Wu Ma and Nicky Wu ( when was the last time I saw them in a movie ) and Korean actor Ahn Sung-kee , this certainly is the movie to watch this week . Forget about them animated penguins , treat yourself to an epic worthy of your time , and well worth a weekend ticket .
A Nutshell Review : Flyboys	This is yet another war movie coming out of Hollywood , but this time it leaves the dramatics and contemplative issues aside , and focus on the action pieces . With its prologue flashing across the screen that we're expecting to learn about the heroes of the war , you know the mood is set for some wham-bam pyrotechnics and stunts . Movies set in WWI are different in the sense that it's the first massive war on a near global scale , which uses various weapons for the first time , and these weapons , though standard of today , were considered weapons of mass destruction for that time with its ability to inflict mass casualties . Weapons like machine guns , tanks , planes , and even chemical warfare unleashed into the trenches are hallmarks of WWI . Flyboys , as the title puts it , turns the spotlight on a group of mostly American volunteers into the French Lafayette Escadrille , a flight squadron . With the plane a relatively new piece of technology in those days , you can trust us humans to find methods to turn technology into killing machines . If you're a fan of flight simulators of old , then Flyboys is right up your alley . For me , I've become an addict on a game called the Red Baron running on an old PC of mine , and I spent countless of hours , just like those pilots in the movie , deciding my affiliation , and flying various missions from the comfort of an armchair . And Flyboys probably took a cue , and what we have were awesome aerial combat , and beautifully modelled aeroplanes employed in missions ranging from bombing , to air defense , and even the attack on German zeppelins . However , after a while , the stunts become pretty ordinary , almost like Star Wars set in WWI , especially with the fleet's style of head to head engagements , except for the ace pilots where specific moves were developed just to show why they're top gun . And this movie does show shades of other similar movies , with the obvious one being Top Gun in the first half , where the motley crew of combatants undergo training at a flight school . It's kind of interesting to observe how training those days are conducted , since the technology and training techniques were still at their infancy . You won't get bored though , as it's almost breezing through flight school with everyone graduating because the life expectancy of a fighter pilot is between 3-6 weeks . They're falling out of the skies like flies . The other familiar element , is the romance bit . Yes , besides flying , pilots do have a life , and with movies , it just cannot do without a beautiful love interest . An accident allowed James Franco's Blaine Rawlings to meet Jennifer Decker's Lucienne , a French woman he develops feelings , but she is hesitant to reciprocate because such budding relationships during war sometimes do not last , more so when he's part of a high risk , high death unit . So what does a pilot do ? Why , set the example for Ben Affleck to follow in Pearl Harbor - take the lady up to the skies ! See the tactic ? Tried and tested I tell you ! James Franco once again plays the brooding lead , and alternates between angst and cockiness with aplomb . Girls will probably watch this movie to squeal each time he appears in uniform . Here , he's your sensitive leader , one who galvanizes his men , as well as shower tenderness on his love . Naturally , he's the recognizable star amongst the rest , besides a ground role for Jean Reno , so he's the ace ( or becoming to be one ) , trying to learn from the guru with the most kills , Reed Cassidy , your expected and seemingly cocky pilot ( wait ! Aren't pilots all ? ) There's a theme I like which the movie explored , and frequently mentioned , and that is the way battles are fought . In olden days , there is always honour , and men fought honourably , according to a moral code of conduct . Which brings us to wonder , do you prefer to fight fair , i . e . should someone lose a sword , either lose yours or allow him to pick his up ? Or do you attack enemies on parachutes by shooting at their chute ? Battle without honour or humanity just to win the fight , is what Rawlings have to come to grips with , and by the end , you will know which is the path he will take . If there's a gripe I had , it was the excessive nodding . It's an acknowledgement that you're good / bad / gonna get screwed , and while the first few might have raised some goosebumps , this particular thingamajig went on and on and on , it just turned our plain hilarious . Do something - nod , downed a bogey - nod , crap in the pants - nod . OK , so I exaggerated on the last one . All in all , it's an aviation action movie fan's wet dream . If games are to be believed , then the German planes have better specification and maneuvered better , but if you believe what the movie said , then it all boils down to the pilots . These flyboys deliver .
A Nutshell Review : I Not Stupid Too	No , you need not have watched the original I Not Stupid to figure out what's going on . Gone are the major Khoo Family ( with the Hokkien-swearing Richard Low ) and the main narrator , Terry Khoo . Instead , newcomer Ashley Leong takes over the narrator's role , as Jerry , the new addition to the Liu Family , with Jack Neo himself , TV actress Xiang Yun , and Shawn Lee as Tom . Then again , forget that this is a direct sequel in terms of characters , as Joshua Ang ( who played the rebellious schoolboy in the 1st installment ) returns , sans mother and kid brother , but with the introduction of an abusive dad played by TV actor Huang Yi Liang . I Not Stupid Too is a standalone movie , with much of the hallmarks of a Jack Neo movie splattered in it . Gone are the much identified and constantly played out political satire and comedy from the first movie , although Selena Tan also returns here , she plays a totally different character from the much disguised political party figure in the first , to a school principal who uses " according to the law " like a crutch . But Neo still injects ample social and topical issues here . On the school front , we see the much criticized Speak Mandarin campaign take a hit , as well as a swipe at the arcane teaching methods of the language . Those who hated the process of learning the language , will probably smile with glee as we're presented with the need to evolve the teaching methods of yesterday . Topical issues and debates like the teacher hitting student in class and the media splashing the news everywhere , and public caning also get discussed , but it's somewhat lacking that only both sides of the spectrum of views are presented , without any deeper exploration from the basic coffee-shop talk . In trying to up the topical hip quotient , smacks of the mention of blogs and the use of it as a narrative tool seemed OK , until you realize it's a blatant Singtel advertisement . Product placements galore in this movie , ranging from Nokia , to in-your-face New Moon abalone cans , and even the UOB bank . While the actors put up commendable effort in bringing to life their characters , you can't help but to think you know much of them . They're like characters common in television drama serials , with their melo-dramatic moments . Surprisingly , much of the comedy and satire left in this movie is confined to the 1st third . The remainder of the movie focused on the other 2 children leads as they mix with bad company and ended up being blackmailed . You might think it's absurd given today's savvy kids , but these are things that are happening - savvy kids can also be gullible too . And you'll never expect that it actually turned out to be one heck of a weepy - many sniffles were head amongst the audience , so those with a weak emotional heart , bring along some tissues . Some might not appreciate that this movie has plenty of sub plots introduced which gets resolved hurriedly , and the length of over 2 hours might make some gawk . There are only certain points in time that you would twiddle your thumbs at the slow moments of the film . But kudos to Neo for highlighting an important plot running throughout , and it's the strong message to parents that they must always remember they bear primary responsibility on the upbringing of their children . He seemed to hit the nail on the head in the portrayal of the current family climate , that neglect and the lack of communication are prevailing , which much be stemmed . Not bad for a commercial film , with a moral of the story that the showing of appreciation is always much lacking in our society , amongst family members , colleagues and even friends . Certainly this movie has legs to be in the running for film awards .
A Nutshell Review : Initial	Just to set the expectations from this review , I have not read the Initial D manga , nor watched any of the anime . Therefore this review's point of view will be from the cinematic experience , and there will be no comparison on how true it stays to the manga / anime . Despite all the star power in the film , from teeny boppers Edison Chen and Shawn Yue , to veterans Kenny Bee and Anthony Wong , this still remains a Jay Chou vehicle ( pardon the pun ) . Jay stars as a petrol pump attendant who by day works at a petrol kiosk , and in the wee hours of the night , helps his tofu selling dad deliver tofu in an old Toyota AE86 Sprinter Trueno using a route that traverses along a winding Mount Akina . Naturally , with his 5 years experience , he intimately knows the terrain , and gets faster each time , until a group of street racers set their sights to conquer the route . There will definitely be comparisons with Hollywood's The Fast and The Furious series , starring Vin Diesel / Paul Walker . The similarities are there - the fast cars , the beautiful racer babes , the rivalry between arrogant drivers . You even get the same cinematography technique used that starts from the driver's POV , pulling back to the dashboard , the rear seat , the boot , and the car from a " helicopter " view . But what sets this film apart is the way it is delivered . Being based on a comic book offers some depth to the storyline , and it helped by staying true to the setting , being based in Japan and not HK . The races in itself might seem repetitive , as the highlight seemed to be focused on its title - the " drift " technique , being used ad-nausem , but having different drivers challenge each other on the one and only route breaks the monotony as you root for your favourite to come out tops . Given this is Jay Chou's debut movie role , it is difficult to critique if his acting skills are up to mark , as his lead character Takumi Fujiwara is a nonchalant man of few words . Which is very much like his persona . His co-stars Edison Chen and Shawn Yue could very well be their own persons as well . Chapman To , as usual , brings across the rather light hearted moments , and Anthony Wong as Chou's dad , a veteran race ace who finds solace in the bottle and having a penchant for dozing off . Perhaps the only flaw about the movie was the sappy romance between Jay and his Japanese co-star . Not that she isn't gorgeous ( which is a saving grace ) , but their scenes together doesn't further the plot much , and slows down the pace somewhat of this movie about the need for speed . This is an enjoyable flick , one in which I waited for the theme song / tune to be featured ( only at the end credits ! ) . But no , I don't think I will be converted to a Jay Chou fan boy anytime soon . I suspect that in the upcoming weeks , we probably might see parallel imports / makes of the Trueno on our shores to satisfy the racer boy wannabes ( heard Singapore only has 2 ? ) , although it probably can't run as fast as in the movies ( movie magic lah ) . And yeah , the driving with one hand on the wheel and the other on the face , with the contemplating look .
A Nutshell Review : The Letter	Korean movies have become so popular that they are high on the export list to the film industries abroad to be remade for local audiences . Leading the pack is Hollywood , and we've recently seen The Lake House . The Thai film industry too took a Korean movie - 1997's # 1 Korean film , The Letter ( Pyeon Ji ) , and gave it their own treatment in Jod Mai Rak . I haven't watched the original , but looking at the result of this Thai effort , they aren't too far behind in the ability to make a melodramatic weepie too . Jod Mai Rak tells the story of two lonely people , a country boy called Ton ( Attaporn Teemakorn ) , and a city girl Dew ( Anne Thongprasom ) , who meet and found each other by chance at a Chiang Mai bus terminal , and as Fate would have it , they would come together after a semi-long distance courtship over the telephone . There are plenty of sweet moments interjected throughout the narrative , like the lingering shots of a bald plum tree which belongs to Ton , and the tender moments during their stay together in Chiang Mai , after personal tragedy made Dew ditch her shared apartment in Bangkok , and opt for the more rustic lifestyle in the countryside . From here , country boy teaches city girl how to live it up with the basic necessities ( well , she still brought over some city artifacts like the PC ) , and naturally lent itself to many moments that will melt your heart . But watching a movie like that isn't interesting , and you always know that there's something extra just waiting to come . Melodramas always have you paint the perfect blissful picture , before coming down with the all too familiar terminal illness plot device . The two star crossed lovers aren't spared this either , and the latter half of the movie see them battle their fears of not having be with each other for long . It's a story of remembrance , and not forgetting the good things in life , of moving on and cherishing the good times . It's impossible for someone not to feel at least a tear in the eye as the dramatics take their full effect , especially towards the end , though there is some redeeming bittersweet feel at the end of the movie . I found the use of the letters in the movie vaguely familiar , and possibly could have been used in other movies I've seen . It's nothing supernatural , and something which is simple , yet I know is highly effective in serving its purpose . Not that I think anyone would be crazy to do something like that in real life , probably will just either freak the other person out , or really prevent someone from truly moving on . The leads Anne Thongprasorn and Attaporn Teermakorn are believable as the lovers . Girls will probably swoon at Attaporn's portrayal of Ton , the real sensitive new age dude who can cook , has green thumbs , and has so much heart and positivity in life . Anne's Dew initially started out quite unlikable , at least to me , with her tendency to be spoilt and taking things much for granted and in a minor way , mistreating Ton perhaps ? But thankfully there is a character change as the movie progresses . Directed by Pa-oon Chantornsiri , Jod Mai Rak is a perfect date movie which centers much on the lives of the two lovers , at the expense of having some throwaway supporting characters . Then again , two's a company , and anything more is always unwelcome . Chiang Mai also makes for an awesome romantic place .
A Nutshell Review : The Ant Bully	First , let's get the obvious out of the way . The ants in The Ant Bully look suspiciously similar to those in Antz ( 1998 ) . Powered by voices from recognizable stars , Antz had a more direct romance theme applied to it , whereas I felt The Ant Bully had a stronger social message to put across , given atrocities that are happening in our world right now . With The Ant Bully , I find that it is a surprising coincidence that this movie is released during a time when countries are whacking other countries , just because they can . Kinda like a bully , as Lucas Nickle in the film is . However , put into context , this troubled kid is a victim too , and can only lash out at others who are smaller in size , and helpless at being in a situation where it's almost impossible to retaliate . Things like the ants in his lawn . OK , so hands up those of you who had been guilty one point in time or another , tortured some innocent ant going about its daily chores of collecting crumbs . I have . Ranging from barbaric acts like burning them with a lighter until they become crisp , or dropping them onto the rice cooker lid when the rice is cooking , having this sick glee in watching them run around escaping to no avail , or even splicing them into half with a blade . Lucas Nickle ( voiced by Zach Tyler ) is dubbed " the destroyer " by the ant colony ( populated with familiar star voices like Julia Roberts , Nicholas Cage , Meryl Streep , Bruce Campbell and Paul Giamatti ) , given his atrocious acts on their habitat . It's a pretty magical like colony that nature designed , with various ant work groups working with efficiency in keeping their colony alive , and they even have their own version of a Merlin , Zoc ( Cage ) , who conjures up magical potions to teach Lucas a lesson . And it is precisely this lesson that is taught , with Lucas serving " community time " , that gives strength to this animated film . As with most arguments , disagreements and such , it usually boils down to the fundamentals of the lack of understanding . Like the racist bloggers who are sentenced not to jail , but to serve time in living with a community they fail to understand , so that they can learn and hopefully , be enlightened . It's also about the building of friendships from once enemies , and included here , though fleetingly , is both a subtle reminder and a commentary about the innate selfishness of human beings in general , in our pursuit for individual self gain , as compared to the natural cooperation amongst a colony of ants , for the good of the community . What makes The Ant Bully stand out , is its departure to a lot of elements which have become staple to recent animated flicks . Gone here are the pop songs played during the movie , or characters breaking out into song and dance . While jokes are still incorporated , it's more witty than slapstick , and there is a severe lack of references to current pop culture , which I thought was a refreshing change . However , there was only one sequence which reminded me of Star War's X-Wing fighters and their attack on the Death Star , right down to the same plot details of having just 1 shot down a shaft to take out the enemy . Don't be put off by the animation similarities to Antz . By itself , there isn't any flaws in the graphics , which turned out superbly when watched in a digital format . Its storyline will be able to engage you , even though at first glance it might seem a little simple at a superficial level . Oh , and I was laughing hard at the peanut joke here too : - )
A Nutshell Review : Kabul Express	Kabul Express had been in a number of local festivals here , as well as in the Asian Festival of First Films , and I rue the missed opportunities to have watched this on the big screen . I guess a DVD with extras would have to do , and my interest was initially piqued because it was one of the first films to have been shot in Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban . Given that we dare not venture into what are currently hot spots in the world , film then serves as the next best thing to be able to see the city of Kabul captured on screen by the filmmakers , for the world at large . Shot entirely in and around Kabul , Afghanistan , Kabul Express features plenty of lush scenery captured by the beautiful cinematography , and it helps that both the writer-director Kabir Khan , and his director of photography Anshuman Mahaley had been in and around the country a couple of times themselves , the former being a documentary filmmaker who had gone a handful of times , and this film summarizes his experiences in the country which he had distilled into his first feature length narrative film . Through their eyes we see worlds that we don't normally see , and they have a very mature and poignant story to tell , steering clear of the very obvious story lines of condemning outright the Taliban here , though not without reasons . Kabir Khan had weaved humanity across all the characters he put into this film , and consciously had everyone from different nationalities and cultures come together in a melting pot known as the Kabul Express , an offroad jeep which is used to ferry them around on a road trip pretty much to satisfy the wishes of the one holding onto the rifle . I thought it was a fine decision to have the actors actually from the countries involved in order to add a little authenticity and to bring across some genuine deep rooted nuances and attitudes to their roles , especially when dealing with the theme of hatred . John Abraham and Arshad Warsi play journalists from India Suhei and Jai respectively , who decided to boost their careers with getting themselves into Afghanistan to interview themselves some Taliban , who are now hunted by the Northern Alliance and the US troops , and are fighting for their lives . With the help of a local Afghan guide Khyber ( Hanif Hum Ghum ) and a chance meeting cum rescue mission of American photographer Jessica Beckham ( Linda Arsenio ) , they come into contact with an escaping Pakistani Imran Khan Afridi ( Salman Shahid ) , who had fought with the Taliban , and now with the help of an AK47 , forces the group to bring him back to the Pakistan border . Kabir Khan had crafted some very nicely done set pieces , be it action or drama , and definitely comedy which hit the right note most of the time , at all the right places . The funny bits do defuse plenty of tension which come inbuilt with the kind of rough wild west lawlessness and terrain that the characters find themselves in , where everyone's for themselves , and self - serving militant groups still around to rule over their self-imposed jurisdictions . And for this Kabir himself got into some flak for portraying the Hazara ethnic group in bad light . There's nothing in black and white , and everything is in grey territory here , such as the symbiotic relationship that Pakistan allegedly shares with the Taliban that gets explored here . But I suppose road movies provide for perfect opportunities where misconceptions are cleared and prejudices get addressed , where fears of the unknown get dissipated once familiarity creeps in . The team in the jeep through time spent together , whether they like it or not , had forged an uneasy alliance and dependence on one another , and if not for their backgrounds , they could be friends , given their common ground for movies , song and love of cricket . Except for the American of course , who's more often portrayed as obnoxious , and doesn't think before she shoots off her mouth . I felt that was one scene where she could have told a white lie in order to ease a tense situation , but in doing what was deemed to be the right thing , had failed to see the obvious repercussions staring right at her face . Blessed by a truly hypnotic score , Kabul Express enthralls , not by being a novelty of achieving firsts in many areas , but through a story which was delivered right by the multi - national cast , and the relevance and importance that we live in a world without strangers , where barriers could be broken down with communication and understanding . Definitely highly recommended in my books !
A Nutshell Review : Kinsey	The movie's tagline says " Let's talk about sex " . And it really does - talk . This is the other bioepic that opens this week in Singapore's shores ( besides The Aviator ) , and it presents to you the life of Dr Kinsey , sex researcher , well , not by chance . Starting off as a zoologist with intense and devoted research on gull wasps , he discovers a necessity to research on sex , sparked by his own ineptness towards making love for the very first time with his virgin wife . As with all research , you need a sample population size to theorize . Collecting gull wasps is must simpler than getting people to reveal their innermost secrets and fantasies , as he painfully discovers . So there lies the opening of the movie , which showcases the methods of questioning he uses to get people to open up and talk about their sex lives . This is perhaps one of the highlights of the movie . And as with all research , you might need to dabble into the queer and the untrodden path . Here , we see him engaging in homosexual love , and in the name of science , unenthusiastically allowing his wife to sleep with his pet student ( hey , he must be impartial and objective to his research ) , and fellow staff members to have sex with others ' wives , and get it on film to be analysed ! Impartiality and objectivity in research also takes centrestage - we're humans after all , with sets of morals that differ from person to person . How much " deviant " practices can one sit through when delving into other's intimate secrets ? In one particular interview , the interviewee boasts to having committed incest , bestiality , etc ! This film charts the rise ( a topic that's " new " , never talked about so openly , hence gaining Dr Kinsey fame ) , to the fall ( societal backlash from challenging normal sexual conventions , mostly from popular nonacceptance and denying the truth about what's happening around society ) of Kinsey's research , and through it , shows that when society's morals and conduct comes under the spotlight , not everyone can accept scientific findings with an open mind - ignorance may be bliss . This movie is stripped of erotica , so anyone who thinks they might have a field day with sex on cellulite ought to think twice . Watch it from a scientific point of view , and you'll enjoy the show tremendously .
A Nutshell Review : Vengeance is Mine	Shohei Imamura's multi award winning film Vengeance is Mine follows after the dismal performance of The Profound Desire of the Gods , this time being a film that is more accessible . Based on a novel which follows the life of crime of real-life criminal Iwao Enokizu ( played by Ken Ogata ) , at one time the most wanted man in Japan for his series of murders , this was probably my favourite movie today , until I watched Imamura's Palme d'Or winner Ballad of Narayama . It's no surprise that this is something more conventional , given that it plays out narratively in retrospect , and that audiences sure like something that is based on real life . I thought it unfurled similarly to Catch Me If You Can , except that while Frank Abignale Jr was once a conman , defrauding banking institutions and adopting various identities , Iwao Enokizu was a killer first , and conman second , assuming identities to obtain cash for basic necessities , and for pleasurable moments to satisfy his lust for flesh . The story seeks to discover his motivation and rationale for a life in crime , and goes way back to when Enokizu was a child , and hating his father for being weak in standing up against oppressors ( in truth , there is little he can actually do except to lose his life if he doesn't comply ) . Hatred also bred deeper when his father is a religious hypocrite , obviously sinning against Enokizu with the lust for his wife Kazuko ( Mitsuko Baisho , who's a dead ringer for Hong Kong actress Cherie Chung ) , and strangely enough , for Kazuko to fall heads over heals for the old man too . This father-son dynamics , like in Catch Me If You Can , pops up now and then through the story to remind you of the beginnings of the feud , except that there is absolutely no love between the two of them . I thought Ken Ogata is enigmatic on screen , with his crazed antics as the killer on the loose , and his suave demeanour when posing as a professor and a lawyer . There's this mean streak within that glint in the eye , and surely , this is one man you definitely would not want to cross . For the most parts of the story , it deals with the love between his Enokizu and an inn manager Haru ( Mayumi Ogawa ) , who falls in love with devotion of blind faith , and the happenings within the confines of that inn . What I thought was a bit difficult to sit through though , was the violence against women in the movie , with the constant slapping across the cheek ( and I notice this too in the other Imamura films ) , and some included rape . But the theme that took the cake was the one on religious hypocrisy as personified by Enokizu's father Shizuo ( Rentaro Mikuni ) , and really , this is the kind of dads , or persons that you'll love to hate . Preaching something and practicing another , you wonder whether Enokizu would seek him out for revenge , since it seemed like Shizuo was indeed Iwao's most hated person on earth , rather than work on his victims by chance . Vengeance of Mine is full of nudity , sex and gratuitous violence , which gave it an R21 rating for today's uncut screening . Simple to follow , and definitely enjoyable by fans who have a preference for true life crime stories . Some of the actors here become familiar faces when they get casted again in the next movie , Ballad of Narayama , and I thought Vengeance was a nice way of introducing those actors to us first .
A Nutshell Review : Exiled	Johnny To has returned with yet another HK gangland movie following his Election movies , and with the casting of the usual suspects in lead roles , it might , to some , become quite tiresome after a while . Not that the actors are bad in their roles , but perhaps with too much familiarity too soon , it may become difficult to tell one apart from the other , or at least character wise . Nick Cheung plays Wo , a man exiled for his misdeed against Boss Fay ( Simon Yam ) , and who has returned and settled down in Macau with is wife ( Josie Ho ) and infant child . Sent to finish Wo off is Anthony Wong's Blaze , and Fat ( Suet Lam ) . However , standing in their way is Tai ( Francis Ng ) and Cat ( Roy Cheung ) , who will not let their buddy go down without a fight . In truth , all of them were buddies once , and having some sent on a mission to finish off another , this broke down their relationship , becoming a decision of forsaking personal friendship for the call of duty . And it is precisely the themes of brotherhood , loyalty and honour that make this film a worthwhile watch , despite its clichés in characters and familiar actors taking on the roles . You can probably think of no better other . Would you defy orders and give up your mission , thus transforming from hunter to prey , or would you seek a compromise in order to save your own skin ? Triad life is always black and white - if you're not with somebody , then you're against him . Told in two distinct acts , it's almost like watching a Japanese " ronin " movie , given how the storyline developed , and the issues and dilemma faced by our merry men . The film is quite 80-ish in presentation and storyline , and filled with plenty of beautifully choreographed poetic violence and gunplay , reminiscent of how John Woo would do his , but minus the doves and nursery rhymes and music . There are enough tension filled moments with its numerous Mexican standoffs , which to me are the highlights of the movie . The excellent stringed soundtrack playing in the background building tension during the calm moments , before erupting into a free-for-all , all-man-for-himself , who-shot-first pumping of lead into the air , keeping you guessing who will emerge unscathed . The pace is deliberately slow most times , in order to build up to the chaotic crescendos of blazing guns . And to some it might be a tad frustrating with many " poser " moments where the ensemble cast stand around , shades on , with a gun in one hand and a cigarette in the other , for good measure . They make good posters , but to the impatient , they'll scream to have things move on . There are plenty of supporting characters like Cheung Siu-Fai as a middleman broker , Gordon Lam as an upcoming gangland boss , and Ritchie Ren's take as a sharpshooting cop . Again their familiar faces lend some weight to their roles , it doesn't add more depth as compared to the leads . Simon Yam is again the crazed and charismatic leader of the mob , with Francis Ng taking on a more subdued role together with Anthony Wong , who actually had the best role amongst the offering as the man faced with the colossal task of deciding where his loyalties lie . Unlike Election with its political undertones , Exiled in my opinion steered quite clear and is what it is , a good old fashioned HK triad picture with heavy focus on friendship and brotherhood . Perhaps the only observatory comment made is the ineffectiveness of the police , more due to cowardice rather than corruption .
A Nutshell Review : K-20 : Legend of the Mask	There's no stopping Takeshi Kaneshiro in charming the socks off everyone , especially since new fans were won over by his heartfelt performance as the Grim Reaper in Accuracy of Death last year , and following that with his Zhuge Liang in Red Cliff . This year in Singapore , he marquees a big budgeted action-mystery masked vigilante movie , and while his powers and abilities to hark back to the Batmans and Spidermans , K-20 turned out to be rather entertaining for its liberal use of special effects , comedy and some fantastic action sequences , set against at alternate Japanese universe . Which is interesting because other than the unmistakable Tower , Tokyo now known as Teito , is quite unrecognizable , and plaguing the country is a huge class and income divide between the aristocrats , and everyone else , which reads the Poor and have nots . It's set after WWII which never happened since Japan signed a peace treaty with the US and the UK , and hence what we have is some strangely futuristic backdrop , and some peculiar background on everyone being conditioned for pre-determined jobs and not having the ability to switch careers . Doesn't make a difference actually to the story , but gives you the feeling that everything is centrally planned . While the title points to K-20 , the fiend with 20 faces , the story's actually focused on Heikichi Endo ( Kaneshiro ) as a poor circus acrobat . And if Bat-fans would see some similarities here , I'd say his character's more like Dick Grayson and with putting his abilities to fighting crime , it's almost exactly how a Nightwing would behave . But back to Japan , Heikichi gets set up by K-20 himself , and gets framed into allowing everyone to believe he's actually the masked villain himself . Breaking out of prison thanks to a merry bunch of thieves whom he soon allies himself with , Heikichi makes it his quest to flush out K-20 and to clear his name , with the help of a nifty grappling hook and rope device . Not being sexist here , but I was pleasantly surprised to learn that K-20 is directed by a female - Shimako Sato , who also adapted the screenplay from a novel by So Kitamura . It's a fresh perspective having to watch an action movie directed by a female at the helm , and the focus here was of course on the characters . We have Takako Matsu as the Duchess Yoko Hashiba , who isn't your standard fare damsel-in-distress , and Toru Nakamura as the police inspector Akechi Kogoro , the arch-enemy of and resident expert on K-20 . It's a classic action mystery which like The Prestige has Russian scientist Teslar providing the object of tussle , a device capable of harnessing and transmitting vast electrical power across locations without the use of cables . K-20 wants it to rule the world , and it's up to our heroes to crack the mystery as to where the device is , and to stop the villain from achieving his goal . The plot's fairly simple , which includes an origin story for Heikichi including the antics of a hero in training , but what made it palatable was the excellent delivery by the cast , together with gorgeous sets and edge-of-your-seat action . A key element here too is the identity of K-20 , having nobody actually seen the villain in the flesh except for Heikichi himself . The story however does sag a little when it lingers on the more dramatic moments , and you'd know for sure when Kaneshiro gets replaced by stuntmen for most of the action shots not on closeup . But as far as big-budgeted movies like these go , K-20 : Legend of the Mask still came across as pretty entertaining and all primed for sequels and a franchise should the box office prove to be successful .
A Nutshell Review : Boy	I guess this subject had already been explored a number of times recently - how convicted criminals , upon release from their jail term , attempt to re-integrate themselves back into society . With Little Children and The Woodsman , we essentially have pedophiles who were released and had to deal with deep rooted prejudice and non-forgiveness in the community they reside in . But what if this criminal is a killer ? Based on the novel by Jonathan Trigell , " Boy A " refers to the unnamed boy who cannot be positively identified during the trial as he's a minor . After serving significant time behind bars , we see him being released from prison , and working with his counsellor Terry ( Peter Mullan ) , he adopts a new identity as Jack Burridge ( Andrew Garfield ) . This is not only for an opportunity to start life afresh with a totally new and made up background , but to serve as a mask of protection against retributive attacks by the case sympathizers , or by the family members who may be out for their own brand of justice served . But of course this is no action movie , so scrap those thoughts of having a man on the run , with contract killers on the loose . What we have here instead is a touching exploration of a teenager's despair at trying to recalibrate his life after the chilling crime committed at an age where he was influenced by best pal Philip Craig ( Taylor Doherty ) . And here's where Andrew Garfield's ability got tested to the max , where he constantly has to live a lie , and finds it extremely hard to work at , and obtain the trust of others , always having to deal with the niggling feeling that he's not being totally honest , and with romance in the picture with Michelle ( Katie Lyons ) , it just complicates things . Fate allows him to redeem himself , but one wonders if that is enough , and whether one good deed can free oneself from the sins of the past . Garfield's charismatic presence will engage you from the get go as he carries the movie through from start right up until the end , and kudos too to the editing and direction set to weave what's essentially two story arcs seamlessly together , with the current timeline , and one which looked at the mysterious past where events were presented a little bit at a time . We see how the two young boys evolve over time in their spiral downwards in morality , and even so the dastardly crime doesn't get shown verbatim , but only through a fishing reference , which will cause the audience to question how culpable Jack was with his involvement in the crime . Running parallel to Jack's story is that of Terry the counsellor was well , being estranged from his wife , and having to address the disappointment he has with his own son . It's not hard to see how close he is to Jack , and how under his care or lackof , would develop inside each boy as the story went along . And this character study also extended to various supporting characters as well , especially one whose promise to another seem to ring hollow the minute you hear it , which just makes it a little bit more heart-wrenching when you see Jack's nonchalant response , as if pre-emptive , and in the know . So , yellow ribbon project ? I suppose the reality of it is that it still boiled down to the crime itself , and just how tolerant society is toward it in a case by case basis . Don't let this gripping drama slip you by , it's powerful stuff that will continue to pose questions for discussion way after the end credits roll .
A Nutshell Review : Letters to the President	While this may have been sanctioned by the Iranian government and the man himself , it's surprisingly quite balanced without a need to censor any sensitive remarks that may have made them look bad , though of course like what was said by people in the beginning that since the camera is trained on them , they had better have good things to say , so I believe some form of self-censorship was practiced , but still a candid remark or two would also have gone through despite comments that could generally be already very guarded . After all , there are issues which are close to the heart and may have strong emotional attachment to them . There's no one on one interview with Iranian President Ahmadinejad throughout the film , as the camera shadows his movement in clips that are from a third person perspective . We see during his rounds throughout the land that his motorcade or entourage gets mobbed each time , and because of his letter policy , have everyone wanting to get his attention , to submit a letter , either personally handing it to him , or given to his aides , or just thrown into his vehicle ! It's like a rock star making an appearance in a downtown city , where thousands profess their love or listen to his every word like the gospel being disseminated . It's clear that this man , elected in 2005 , is popular in his country , but feared by the West because of his controversial sabre-rattling which his supporters echo ( also in the film on nuclear energy , and making a bomb while at it ) . Watching this film you might be inclined to evaluate if this is a President for his people , or is it just a facade ? The film doesn't answer it , but provides both sides of the argument for your evaluation . It first starts with everything quite positive in terms of the people's vocal support , before peeling away the layers to suggest a number of cracks within the system , especially highlighting some broad division within society , between the rural and the urban folks , providing some keen insights to what could be happening behind relatively closed doors with vast differences in their basic concerns . For example , the female urbanites are quite vocal in their unhappiness with the morality police , and the urban folks , with what was presented in this documentary , being less guarded with their opinions even in front of the camera . On the surface , the letter writing system Ahmadinejad put in place might seem an excellent idea , given of course replies come from him personally to address the concerns of his people . In theory that is , because once you start to receive millions of letters demanding your personal attention to issues , logistics would mean employing a team to tackle the reading , replying , and execution of the reply . The result's quite impressive , because of the millions of letters received , the reply rate is about 3 in 4 , somewhat akin to writing to Santa Claus I suppose , with only those who are nice being entertained before goods get dispensed . You can see the immense logistics set up for this , with letter processing centres and call centres being staffed with paramilitary personnel who are groomed as future leaders of the state . I thought this was a shrewd move given that you're allowing them to gain first hand experience in a wide myriad of grassroots issues . A reply to the letter writer is often treated with gratitude , but a deeper issue lies in the fact that a high response rate doesn't necessarily translate to a modest success rate , because issues are normally basic bread and butter kind , and with the international sanctions in place further limiting scarce resources , it's back to dealing with red tape and bureaucracy . It's also curious to note that more women than men subscribe to the scheme , where they fervently believe that he will be able to solve their problems , mostly stemming from feeling the impact of sanctions , doing away with meat and high inflation on food prices , which the men dismiss as just tough luck because of the worldwide shortage . There was some significant time devoted to this aspect , with the focus of two women in conversation while waiting to meet the President during his meet-the-people session , which didn't materialize . As a documentary , Letters to the President presents basic issues faced by the general population , so those looking for a documentary on the Iranian leader would find this a little lacking in that aspect . But nonetheless it managed to offer a peek into the psyche of very different groups of people , and the day to day problems and concerns each face .
A Nutshell Review : The Brave One	I'm not sure why The Brave One got no love . Perhaps one could have been jaded by so many revenge themed movies , where things get taken into one's own hands because we believe revenge is a dish best served cold . From the martial arts genre to stylized violent movies like Tarantino's Kill Bill double , I'd warrant a guess that anything more rooted to the reality of today , and in the movie's forced allusion in making a statement about the Iraqi War , will make one roll their eyes in disbelief . But on its own , The Brave One is a satisfying picture . It offers no apologies to those who condone taking matters into their own hands , and establishes a stage for you to feel good about doing so too . One of the earliest movies I remember about revenge was Eye for an Eye , where as a kid I watched Sally Fields hunt down Kiefer Sutherland . And not to forget one of my favourite comic book heroes happen to be a masked vigilante prowling the streets of Gotham , never batting an eyelid in crippling opponents , all the while searching for the elusive Joe Chill who murdered his parents in cold blood . In similar ways , Erica Bain ( Jodie Foster ) is a woman on a dazed mission . She too is in search for the group who killed her fiancé and beaten her to a pulp ( akin to Robocop ) , hunting for her own Joe Chill . Along the way , she finds new strength within herself , though admittedly , discovers that she's morphing into a totally different person altogether , one who does not hesitate in dispensing her own brand of justice with her black market 9mm handgun . I for one was cheering her on as she ends the lives of evil persons who have the misfortune of crossing her path , then again , does that mean I got the propensity to do the same ? Perhaps . But here's where the movie succeeds in getting you riled up , and throwing your weight of support behind Erica's unlawful ways . As mentioned , it sets the stage properly in having you think the victims are in desperate need of some lessons to be taught , and given that they too preach a brand of violence , they jolly well deserve what came to them . In painting the police force as bureaucratic and inept , it elevates our support level for Erica as well . But we have Detective Mercer ( Terrence Howard ) who gets acquainted with our leading lady , as the two of them exchange thoughts , philosophies and pain through their friendship , providing some light that there are right and wrong , black and white , but there's always that shade of gray which makes it a constant challenge for those on the side of the law to adhere to following the book , because any deviation might mean a chance for legal exploitation , and the perpetrator walks . Foster's role is nothing unique here , as she had been The Accused before , but it's only in this movie that I realize how successfully she projected vulnerability , given her small frame . And she's getting noticeably aged too , with unavoidable wrinkles tracing her face when the camera goes up close . Holding his own against the award winning actress , Terrence Howard didn't have much else to do besides the cursory investigations into a supposed serial killer , being the supplemental detective character in a movie that touches on putting matters into your own hands . Enough suspense was built towards the finale although it degenerated almost into some unsatisfying Western high noon shoot out , and the ending is probably the best that could be mustered out of the story , despite its quite obvious stance toward vigilantism . When the credits roll , you'd sta rt to wonder if you too could go ballistic when someone else trespasses against you . And I just got to mention that Sarah McLachlan's Answer was plain beautiful .
A Nutshell Review : Mission : Impossible III	The burning question in everyone's mind will be , does this third Mission live up to its hype , justify its mass publicity , and above all , surpass the first two movies ? In my opinion , M : I : III makes it an explosive start to the summer lineup , lives up to the hype it built , but though it took on a more personal look into the life of Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt , I still felt , and no offense to JJ Abrams , that while it balanced action with personal drama effectively , somehow it lacked that X-factor oomph after all the smoke has cleared , to truly make it one heck of a classic action thriller . Sure , elements of M : I are there , the mysterious calls , high octane action and technology driven gadgets which self-destruct in 5 seconds , save for the missing traditional opening sequence where images and agents photos are juxtaposed as Lalo Schifrin's theme comes blaring . But that nit pick aside , and don't get me wrong , I did enjoy JJ Abrams contribution to the franchise on the whole . The gem in this movie is not that large explosion on the bridge where everything blows , or those action scenes in Shanghai . Rather , it's the first few minutes . It's truly intense , and I'd say it's one of the better suspenseful openings of films this year , which sucks you in right into the heat of things , and slowly demands an emotional response from you , which is quite rare in a genre movie like this . It provided Cruise a platform to showcase his acting range of fear , moments of calm , intense rage , desperation , all rolled into one , and Philip Seymour Hoffman , just absolute chilling . If you think that the teaser trailer piece by him is good , wait till you take a look over here , right at the start . Ethan Matthew Hunt the man is explored in depth , and faces domestic issues that most uniformed men do - the dreadful fear of a loved one put in harm's way . It never is easy to suppress those romantic and primal emotions , and it makes matters worse when you're an agent sworn to secrecy . Hunt in this movie explores this side of his humanity , as he gets embroiled in yet another impossible mission . And I thought given Cruise's recent relationship and marriage to Katie Holmes , it might have helped him to bring across those emotions fairly easily . This time round , JJ Abrams made better use of the Team . Comprised of old hand Luther Stickell ( Ving Rhames ) , Declan ( Jonathan Rhys Meyers ) and Zhen ( Maggie Q ) , we see the classic IMF teamwork in action as they go from mission to mission , properly utilizing their skill sets . Well , that is until somewhere along the line where you start to realize that Stickell's the joker with the punchlines , Declan's a generic agent , and Zhen is a looker . Well , at least there's a team ! The main villain , Owen Davian ( Hoffman ) , turned out to have very limited screen time , but the Academy Award winning actor managed to make the most out of it . Although his Davian character is one of the more ambiguous villains of late , with agendas not fully spelt out , he gives you the feeling that he's one whom you will do your utmost not to mess with . Either finish him off and do it twice for good measure , or suffer the consequences this cool killer dishes out . There are some nice " first times " in this movie , like watching how the agents banter amongst themselves while executing their plans to a T , how a latex mask is created in real time , and the showing of the interiors of the highly secretive IMF office , but there are some rehashes from the first two movies , and even references from Cruise's earlier movies like Top Gun ( motorcycle alongside runway anyone ? ) . Shades of plot repetition like a mole in the organization ( I think every secret organization will surely have one ) , leaping from buildings ( I think this is a Hunt specialty ) and techniques like falling and breaking fall with the use of cables just inches off the ground , are tongue-in-cheek like references . If you're a nitpicker , there are also quite a number of obvious security-related flaws in the plot ( hey , you're IMF ! ) - use of codenames is a must , as is the procedure for transporting highly dangerous criminals . It's probably broken a number of standard protocols , but hey , it's a summer movie , so please don't look too much into it ( that's a reminder to self ) . On a fun side , it did have a poke at the US foreign policy , but that's only a poke , before tossing that idea aside from boring audiences who are in for some cool set action pieces . The much beloved theme surprising becomes a little low key in the score , so don't hold your breath as you wait for it to come on . And if you have a question as to why DHL has so much clout in the marketing efforts , the movie will provide you a satisfactory reason . All in all , M : I : III provided a fair share of action and quiet moments , personal vendetta versus grande plots and schemes . Will I root for another M : I sequel ? Sure , why not , as this installment proved that there is still some mileage in the franchise , after the disastrous M : I : II . It's a good start to the summer .
A Nutshell Review : December Boys	The buzz for December Boys surely points to how Daniel Radcliffe will fare sans cloak , glasses and lightning bolt scar on his forehead , to star in a movie that's totally out of the Harry Potter franchise . Gone are the fantastical elements and scores of ready , adoring fans , and in comes a serious dramatic piece about the coming of age , growing up , and raging hormones . Wait , Harry Potter is about that too doesn't it , although it stretches over 7 movies ? But Radcliffe comes through unscathed , and it's not before long that you'd forget that here's Harry Potter . While possibly the biggest recognizable name on the cast list , it wasn't a walkover performance as everyone else had raised their act and not allow a young starlet usurp the strength of the movie . Based on a novel by Michael Noonan , December Boys tells the story of 4 orphans , all being born in the month of December , who were sent packing to a seaside village for a vacation , by virtue that it's a reward sent to the orphanage , and what better ( lazier ? ) way to select the lucky few , than the ones celebrating their birthdays the same month . So we have Maps ( Radcliffe ) , Misty ( Lee Cormie ) , Sparks ( Christian Byers ) and Spit ( James Fraser ) sent on a journey that will test their close friendship , and as usual , each will come face to face with their individual challenge that will forever change their lives . Gee , I sound like a generic trailer , but trust me , although the premise might sound cliché , December Boys hinges very heavily on the delivery of the child actors for its success . While the spotlight might be on Radcliffe and Cormie , Byers and Fraser each have their own charm , but are restrained by the frequency of their characters ' on-screen appearance . The landscape of Kangaroo Island adds vast scale to this relatively small movie , opening our eyes to natural geographical wonders , becoming a character in itself , with its inhabitants mere players on its grounds . While it's not Stand By Me , there's the usual basis that lurks around begging for comparisons . And worse , the story here allows for each of them to try and go one leg up on the other , as they learn that one of the purposes they are there at the village , was to allow for one of them to be selected for adoption . Hence the competition amongst the boys as they vie for attention , putting on their best behaviour , most contrary to what their actual characters are like . Each child however , have an episode directed around him , to similarly allow the audience to pick their preferred sub plots , involving a giant fish , a misunderstood motorcycle stuntman , dealing with mortality issues when their surrogate guardian has to battle disease , and of course , saving the best for last and for Radcliffe , first love , in the form of a young lolita Lucy ( Teresa Palmer ) . Soon , their hot blooded young boy antics and rebellious streaks give way to a tone of seriousness , and there's where the movie adds its poignant gravitas . December Boys might not seem much from the get go , but with each passing minute , it adds layers upon layers to build its repertoire and stand up against the scrutiny of mediocrity . By the time the final scene rolls by , even though it doesn't show much and does so mostly through narration , I thought the ending was perfect , with a tinge of regret , happiness , sorrow , and a show of solidarity all rolled into one .
A Nutshell Review : Zack and Miri Make A Porno	If I may sound like a prude , it's been a while since I laughed so hard and so loud at and with a comedy , given that most have been relatively lacklustre flicks of late . And it took a Kevin Smith one to do just that , with its unadulterated , no holds barred treatment of material where anything and everything goes , where there's no such thing as taboos to be avoided , and somehow , the more vulgar the merrier , as this is definitely one unapologetic movie . You have been warned . Yes , some may laud this beast as a travesty , but let's face it , sex sells . While it may be a tad shameless to make a downright porn film , Kevin Smith has injected some of the usual quirks found in his filmography , as well as paying homage to his fan boy roots . You can tell this by the numerous moments where pop culture comes into reference , as well as quite a significant time spent on bastardization of Star Wars ( entitled Star Whores ) that the characters dwell upon , to great comic effect . If you are a fan of George Lucas ' galactic series , you may take offense , but might still credit Smith for his wild imagination . If you're not a fan , you'll whoop for joy as you'll probably agree with how it got ripped to shreds . Either way , one wonders of course if this is indeed Smith's secret fantasy ( with Princess Lay-Her ahem ) , but I digress . While it took a while for Zack ( Set Rogen ) and Miri ( Elizabeth Banks ) to conceive the titular plan to save their sorry state of cash flow problems , this movie is not about making a porn film for the sake of . It may have touched upon some moments of truth that one might venture into this somewhat considered lucrative business , but ultimately at its core , it's still a straightforward romance that reared its clichéd head ( pardon the pun ) in building up to the finale , and one that talks about friendship in general . It follows a typical zero to hero storyline for all the characters involved , and through making this film , they discover new found friendships that can withstand some hard knocks ( well , considering you have to bear your privates for everyone else to see ) together with finding some great camaraderie amongst them misfits , and taking centerstage is the underlying , unsaid romance between two house mates who deny their affections for each other for the longest time . Seth Rogens may be famous for playing roles such as these , with his lucky stint opposite Katherine Heigel in Knocked Up , as well as various Judd Apatow films , so some might consider that he could play Zack with his eyes closed . Truth is , he does , and I guess it will take some time before he could get out of this stereotype . Hopefully , his Green Hornet project would take off properly , and for detractors , I guess you'll need to watch this film to see him sans his beard to be convinced that he just might pull it off . Elizabeth Banks had a lot more to do here of course in fleshing our Miri , since she is primarily the yes-no-flip-flop character who refuses to listen to her heart , and her dalliance with such indecisiveness , puts a strain in the friendship with Zack . There are plenty of scenes here that earned merit , but I particularly liked the out of place one in the first third of the story , where a school reunion is to get us chummy and comfortable with both Zack and Miri's characters , but contains enough laughs here to leave you in stitches . Look out for Justin Long playing Brandon , and Brandon Routh ( the latest Superman ) being Long , in what would probably be amongst the best jokes in the film , with Routh being the punching bag for Long's really flamboyant character with a deep voice . Like I said , it's funny and it's no holds barred , so go in with an open mind and an attitude to just laugh at everyone's funny antics ( right down to poop jokes if you will ) , and you just may leave with a nice smile at the end of it . Oh yeah , remember to stay tuned when the end credits roll for a look into the aftermath of Zack and Miri's film production company !
A Nutshell Review : Elegy	An elegy . A form of poetry that mourns of something that has deteriorated . And in this film there couldn't be more references to this term , forming the basis of the theme and everything that happens to all the characters involved in this pensive , melancholic piece . Based on the novel by Philip Roth and directed by Isabel Coixet , this film stars Ben Kingsley as culture critic and lecturer David Kepesh , and snapshots his life during the twilight years , where physical deterioration doesn't mean a proportionate deterioration in sex drive . Or at least that's what the character's first impression to the audience was . Through narration , we get to hear David's innermost thoughts , where he candidly reveals both his fear of growing old , and private moments where he honestly shares with us his feelings especially toward the new and beautiful student in his class , Consuela ( Penelope Cruz ) . While aware of the 30 odd years age gap separating them , that doesn't mean that he's going to give up his game of skirting around the sexual harassment decorum of the school . In fact , his physical relationship with his student form the crux of the film , about perceived societal pressure and disdain for cradle snatchers , of how one's initial motive of a short fling could turn out to be something more serious and emotional , and relationship insecurities on both sides - with one understandably jealous of some unseen , young strapping hunk there to take his lady love away , and of the other worried that there might be commitment issues with a man so advanced in his age . But what lifted this movie into a different emotional stratosphere , are the supporting cast and characters that surround David's life , either providing counsel , or problems and issues to deal with altogether . A visibly aged Dennis Hopper plays David's best friend and poet George O'Hearn , who while on one hand goads him to do the right thing ( or ending it all off ) , he too might seem a little hypocritical , and brings about a fleeting notion of infidelity to the table too . And it seems that dysfunctional characters in the relationship sense permeates through the film at every corner . We have David's F-buddy Carolyn ( Patricia Clarkson ) who's an alpha-female type character with all the luck at the professional level , but none whatsoever on the personal front , and David's estranged son Kenneth , played by the excellent and terribly under-rated actor Peter Sarsgaard , who shares some of the most poignant and memorable scenes in the movie opposite Ben Kingsley , trading some very quick witted barbs . Just as when you thought the film might seem to have reached is plateau , it surprises one with a startling development that would on one hand seem to satisfy the voyeur in the audience ( given the rating , and consistent audible yawns during the non-sexual moments ) , but on the other push through that sense of regret that makes you feel for the characters . Excellent acting from the ensemble cast , and with relationship themes that many could identify with , would make Elegy earn that recommended status from me .
A Nutshell Review : Surf's Up	It's easy to roll your eyes when you see yet another animated movie starring talking animals , and what more , talking penguins . Guess you can credit the popularity of our feathered friends from down south to award winning films like the documentary which started it all , March of the Penguins , and the other animated movies Madagascar ( where they were scene stealers ) and Happy Feet . But before you actually decide to pass on this one , Surf's Up a surprisingly refreshing tale set in the bright sunny beaches with laid back " dude " attitude , which doesn't seem to try too hard to please , and comes up just about right . One of the good things about the movie is the voice talent featured . Like Happy Feet , it contains some recognizable names , but just as a reminder to our Legend of the Sea friends , big names doesn't necessarily equate to good voice acting . Shia LeBeouf ( a name which we will see quite frequently over the next few months with Transformers and Disturbia ) gets the lead role of Cody Maverick , a surfer penguin wannabe who dreams of making it big in the surfing community . His idol is Big Z ( Jeff Bridges ) , a world champion who had made an impression on a young Cody . However , Big Z is presumed missing in action during one competition , and the new world champion , Tank Evans ( Diedrich Bader ) looks set to retain his status for the umpteenth time . The supporting characters too are a delight , with Zooey Deschanel as a Baywatch lifeguard babe and James Woods as a sports tzar , and Jon Heder continues his stereotype by playing Cody's new best friend Chicken Joe , a chilled out surfing chicken who finds himself at probably the wrong place each time and associating with the wrong species . What made this movie work is that the filmmakers recognize they have to come up with a narrative style that is different in order to engage , and given that it's a sports type movie , they went for a sports entertainment channel style , complete with replicating camera techniques including details like less than perfect wireless camera transmissions ( love those on-board cameras , nevermind if it doesn't make complete sense or is illogical ) , over the top channel transition sequences , and you just gotta love those faux pas interviews with just about every character . If you can't get enough of baby penguins , the filmmakers too are shrewd enough to include these crowd favourite characters in endearing scenes . With Father's Day mood all round , this movie is apt too for the season , given its theme of family , and bonding with ( surrogate ) father types . The humour injected ranges wide , from subtle lines and references , to the more obvious physical slapstick moments . I can't resist but to again advise our Legend of the Sea friends , this is what computer animation is about , with its depiction of photo realistic quality of the sun , sand and the sea , with realistic surfer moves , a simple story yet packed with adequate thematic moments , with song and music that don't irritate , but serve to move the narrative along smartly . Recommended animated movie , despite the overused penguin characters . Stay until after the end credits for a short scene ( there's also one played during the credits , so don't walk out of the hall just yet ) .
A Nutshell Review : Mad Hot Ballroom	OK , so it took me 3 attempts before finally being able to watch this - the first was free , but aborted because of timing . The second attempt , only the first 3 rows were available for a weekday evening , and I'm not too keen on craning my neck . The third and successful attempt had me walk all the way from Orchard Cineleisure to Shaw Lido , in 10 minutes flat on a crowded weekend afternoon . But the mad rush was well worth it . New York City elementary schools have a 10 week long co-curricular activity ( CCA ) for its students , where they learn ballroom dancing , and then compete in a city wide dance competition . How cool is that ? Finally , a CCA from which you can actually learn something useful , a skill that stays with you for life . Imagine learning from young , the steps to the Tango , Foxtrot , Swing , Merengue , etc . Wow . But there's a much higher cause in teaching ballroom dancing to the students . And that is to inculcate in them from young , a sense of hope , responsibility - to themselves in mastering a skill , to their partners in performing well , and being a team player to the entire class / school , and a setting of an achievable goal if they were to work hard at it . Most students in the public schools come from the lower spectra of society , and as the movie goes , based on statistics , many may end up on the streets , probably living in the hood of crime or other vices like drugs . This programme allows the students to dream a little dream , work hard towards a common goal , build their self-confidence and esteem , and have them thinking about the kind of future they want to pursue . So we follow different classes , and their trainings with the teachers , where we see them learning the basics of the different kinds of dances . It's pretty raw at first , but by the time the movie progresses , from the quarters to the finals , you'd see a marked improvement in the slickness of their paces . Their moves might still not be as polished , but bear in mind that these are only 11 year olds , not your already established dancers , or make believe actors . The downside of competition is that for every winner , there'll be more losers , and the movie takes stock of this , and feature the losing teams as well , and how the lost affected the students , and the dread that the teachers have to go through to explain that it's part and parcel of competition , and life . The movie is interspersed with various interviews and candid discussions amongst the students , and teachers , and it makes it compelling each time as you actually see that despite their little age , they demonstrate much innocent maturity , listening to them talk about boys , girls , relationships , dreams , etc . There's this pudgy looking boy whom I thought was pretty natural in getting himself into weird situations , and taking it all in his stride , and providing some of the laughs too . The teachers have their work cut out , having to teach their class , and then selecting only a handful to compete , and also to prep them up for the competition , and potential failure of not being emerging champions . Before long , you'll find yourself tapping along to the various dances , making you want to get up there and move to the groove too - hey if 11 year olds can do it , and be good at it , why not give it a try ? On the downside though , since the moves are done by students , they're taught really basic steps , and it does get repetitive , but hey , it's all in the name of fun . Do catch Mad Hot Ballroom ! If I have a recommendation to make for movies this week , watch this before it gets pulled out from the theatres ! Stay throughout the end credits as they'll be more discussion snippets from the tots .
A Nutshell Review : Jarhead	Welcome to the suck . 6 months of waiting for 4 days of " battle " . Finally a decent yet different war genre movie set during the first Gulf War , which featured what was touted by Saddam as the Mother of All Battles , not . Jarhead is based upon the book by former Marine Anthony Swofford , on his experiences in the Desert Shield and Desert Storm operations . But we start the journey from the beginning , at the boot camp , and that , to many NS men , will bring back fond memories of the BMT days when nasty drill sergeants rained down vulgarity filled commands , and punishments meted out from whims and fancies . You'll chuckle wholeheartedly , but of course not when you're at the receiving end . The burly platoon mates , the sexual innuendos , the male bonding sessions in the bunks , the various antics , the talk-cock sessions ; nostalgic I tell you . Jake Gyllenhaal , who seemed all over the local screens this early 2006 with Proof , Jarhead and the upcoming Brokeback Mountain , plays Swoff , a Marine Scout Sniper whose perspective we see the War from . He's no angel though , as we witness his trials and tribulations in the United States Marine Corps sent to the Middle East . The supporting cast of Peter Sarsaard as his buddy , and Jamie Foxx ( in another military role after the disappointing outing in Stealth ) help lift the movie with their fine performances . What appeals in this movie , the strong points , are the numerous elements that are identifiable with Gulf War I - the friendly fire , the air strikes , the looming threat of chemical warfare , the television coverage and interviews with troops you see so very often over CNN , the dubious anti-chemical agent pills , the oil well fires , and the smoking ' civilian convoys . They're all there in the narrative , played out as it is . We also look into the difficulties the men face when stuck out there in a different land , in an indefinite period of waiting - the loneliness , the worry of their loved ones being unfaithful , the rush to wait and the wait to rush , the time offs , the duties , training , massive water hydration parades , and even the hand jobs to past time . Naturally we do see certain bits that fell victim to the censor's scissors , but somehow I'm not really complaining . And the cinematography is brilliant . With the aid of digital effects , the desert never looked so blinding in the day , and so alluring in the night . The oil-fire smoke-filled night sky looked awesome , and so real , you could feel the heat and the oil droplets raining from above . And the pop music interjected at various points in the movie , is just groovy and adds to the flavour . However , at certain points this movie cuts a bit too close to Apocalypse Now with scenes of war machinery cutting its way through the desert land , and in scenes where the troops go berserk in their chilling and celebration , though an earlier scene somehow prepared you for its upcoming similarities . Also what I thought was a minor technical boo-boo , keep a look out for the dust covers on the rifles . Hmm . This is my recommended movie for the week to all NS personnel ; you'll definitely find something you'll identify with . And to the rest of the folks , never mind about the war setting , this is one intense drama that might just appeal to you . Welcome to the suck .
A Nutshell Review : King Kong	Peter Jackson nailed Kong ! ( Please pardon bad pun ) In his version based on the 1933 classic , Jackson delivered as promised , sticking close to the source material , yet adding his touches of epic grandeur . Doubling the original's length , clocking in at 3 hours , provided ample opportunity for character development for the major leads ( and even for Kong itself ) , and doesn't scrimp on elaborate action sequences . Kudos to the cast for their effort in what is mostly interaction within imaginary backgrounds and a digital Kong . The main leads of Naomi Watts as vaudeville actress Ann Darrow , Jack Black as movie director Carl Denham and Adrien Brody as screenwriter Jack Driscoll were almost perfect . Given loads of time to flesh out their characters , you'd come to appreciate and understand their motivations a lot more . Black , known more for his zany comedies , makes a wonderful Carl Denham , adding slight humor to his dramatic role . Watts , as usual , looked beautiful in her role as the damsel , who , in an update , brings a certain tough attitude to her fragile exterior . Brody completes the trinity as the lovelorn Jack Driscoll who has to battle Kong for the affections of Darrow . Production values were certainly top notch , and in the instant this movie opens , you'll fall in love with the accurate depiction of 30s Manhanttan . For those who already know of the story outline , we begin in New York where Denham seeks out a new aspiring actress for his new movie set in Singapore ( yes , we're mentioned , just like the 1976 remake ) . However , he's really leading the ship and crew to Skull Island to make his new movie , and there , they meet up with the island's unfriendly and hostile inhabitants , as well as its god , Kong . The movie takes about an hour to reach the island , and hence some might find it slow moving . But keep your eyes peeled on the beautiful cinematography , and listen closely to the dialog - plenty of references to the original Kong movie ( I so loved the line where they wanted to get Fay Wray involved in their production , but sadly she had an ongoing movie project with RKO . Classic ! ) And Skull Island proved to be an action sequence playground , with the much touted Kong versus the Rexes ( 3 of them actually , probably my favorite would be the finale where Kong dealt the killing blows ) being the highlight . In a parallel sequence consisting of Denham , Driscoll and various expendable crew , the dino-chase sequence probably put the Jurassic Park sequels to shame , although there are some portions where the digital rendering looked cheap . But minor nitpicking aside , it still made for some edge-of-your-seat moments . The hour on Skull Island provided much time for the Beast to fall for the Beauty , keeping her as its trophy companion , who performed vaudeville acts for its entertainment , while it served as her protector from mutant like creatures . Andy Serkis provided much of the facial movements and expressions for Kong , just like he did for Gollum in the Lord of the Rings trilogy . And we do see the sensitive side of the much maligned ape - it seemed that all it wants is a little tranquility , watching beautiful sunsets / sunrises with its human playmate , who seemed to be able to take the roller coaster tossing from limb to limb and from vine to vine with nary a scratch to her beautiful legs and indestructible lingerie . Perhaps a departure from the other Kongs is that this digital one kept its primal instincts in check , and doesn't attempt to disrobe our heroine . Noble . But as Fate would have it , Kong gets captured in an intense sequence , which shows off its brutality . The movie makes no apologies for many bites , kicks , and slams between human and beast , or amongst beasts . It's violent , but that's the way it probably is . And in Manhatten , hailed as the Eighth Wonder of the World , Kong wrecks havoc to look for Darrow , and brings her atop the Empire State Building for the climatic showdown . In between , I thought the ice rink moment was a pretty nifty touch , but one which somehow jarred the pace until the intervention of the army . And that iconic final scene , what a beauty ! You'd know it's a lost cause , but yet it's a tragic spectacle to witness . To the sentimental ones , no , I know we'd have all fallen in love with Jackson's Kong by then , but we're sticking to the original , so don't expect anything else but the original ending . And speaking of which , I sure would have loved to hear Howard Shore's rendition of the soundtrack , but alas , his hasty departure due to creative differences with Jackson paved the way for James Newton Howard to pen the score . Not that it's bad , but I thought it lacked a certain oomph at times . In short , this Kong has all the ingredients of a mighty fine event movie . Given its length , it doesn't squander its opportunities for a more in depth take at one of the best known cinematic monsters created . Definite must-watch !
A Nutshell Review : Little Miss Sunshine	This is today's GV Surprise Screening . For their debut feature length film , directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris probably couldn't ask for a better script - Little Miss Sunshine is a comedic drama which has plenty of heart , even though the characters are misfits put together in a dysfunctional family . But wait , before you roll your eyes at yet another story with quirky characters , this one probably proved itself to be relatively superior given its easy going delivery , never taking itself too seriously with the messages it tried to put across , and the cast is a joy to behold . Telling the story of the Hoover family's journey cross-country to bring their young daughter to the finals of the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant , it's an insane road trip movie as well in their yellow family mini-van . Abigail Breslin first made her debut in M Night Shyamalan's Signs as Mel Gibson's daughter , and here she's the wide-eyed adorable child who will just tug at your heartstrings - you'll probably be sympathizing with her character's ( mis ) fortune with a family like hers . But there's where the fun is , no ? The more recognizable actors here will be Steve Carrell ( The 40 Year Old Virgin ) , as her gay scholarly uncle , and Toni Collette ( In Her Shoes ) as her mom . Rounding up the cast are Greg Kinnear as motivational-inspirational speaker Dad , Paul Dano as her brother who had taken a vow of silence , and Alan Arkin as coke-sniffing , foul - mouthed grandfather who dotes on her . While the opening might take its time to set the scene , once the family gets together there's no holding back . The dialogues and interactions between characters are fast and snappy , and each character's given enough screen time to showcase their tribulations and respective resolution . Which I found to be deftly done both in script and direction . There was one major loophole spotted , but nothing to mar your enjoyment of the movie . What I totally liked about the movie , is by the end of it , there's this warm fuzzy feeling that you'll feel about the message brought across , that the strength of family lies in sticking together , and through that , any adversary can be defeated , any troubles overcome . Anything else doesn't matter so long as there's unity , and the movie shows this pretty nicely - the gem of self-discovery together , and the getting out of the rut with support from one another . The crowd favourite is definitely the finale , which will more than likely to blow you away as it comes rather unexpectedly , and raises a few eyebrows too . At the screening , almost everyone was clapping and cheering , and the last time I experienced that kind of joy , was in the finale of Kinky Boots , which on hindsight , is similar in the kind of feeling it evokes from you . Though I must add that it was kind of unnerving somewhat watching the young performers prance around with their fake plastic smiles , stiff hair and loads of makeup . In life there are winners and there are losers . Little Miss Sunshine , is definitely a winner . Go watch !
A Nutshell Review : Thank You for Smoking	I was attracted to the movie because of its title - Thank You for Smoking . It's not politically correct - where's the " not " ? And the trailer looked like it was a whole lot of fun as well , with a tobacco evangelist spreading the good news about smoking and cigarettes . Coincidentally , this movie also turned out to be this week's GV Surprise Screening selection . I like movies with ensemble cast too , and this one consisted of Aaron Eckhart , Maria Bello , Sam Elliot , Rob Lowe , William H Macy , JK Simmons , Robert Duvall , Katie Holmes and Cameron Bright . Not the usual big names , but a stellar cast nonetheless , some of whom you would've come across in other big budgeted movies , like JK Simmons - the James Jonah Jameson in Sam Raimi's Spidey , or Cameron Bright - the most over-under utilized kid from Ultraviolet and X3 . The opening credits played to the song " Smoke , Smoke , Smoke that Cigarette ! " , consisting of colourful cigarette boxes , already got me hooked , and the protagonist of Nick Naylor ( Eckhart ) , the tobacco industry lobbyist , is one heck of an interesting character , and holds one heck of a dream job . He's not a lawyer , but can sure talk like one , and has the same uncanny ability to turn black into white with his wit and persuasion . There are plenty of witty lines and dialogue in this movie , played out with some cheese and infused with comedy at the right moments . My favourite moments are those in which Nick teaches his son Joey ( Bright ) how to win arguments , which he's the best at the business at . About the flawed but sounds-so-sexily correct logic which is employed to break down the arguments of another . He has few friends , since anti-smoking lobbyists are a dime a dozen , and counts amongst his circle of trust , the Mod Squad , consisting of fellow spin doctors from the Alcohol and Firearms industry ( Maria Bello and David Koechner respectively ) . Their chill out get together dinner sessions are a hoot to watch , as they go about sharing ideas , spinning techniques , and rant about their collective enemies . If there's a lesson to take away from this picture , it's not to sleep and tell , especially if the reporter has glorious tits , in the mould of Katie Holmes . Bent on exposing the slickest in the business , you thought that Nick would be beaten down with a scandal . But as they say , it's always tough to keep a good man down ! Besides the romantic entanglement , there's a little sub plot about office politics , like having a " leaning mountain " in the form of your boss's boss , and the trouble that will inevitably knock on your door when he's no longer around . Compelling stuff . In a movie which seemed to be pro-tobacco , you'd be surprised that NONE of the characters actually light up on screen ! The closest we got to was from a movie " Sands of Iwo Jima " shown on television , but he got shot when he was distributing ciggies to his mates . How's that for irony ? And I have no idea why the local rating is M18 for sexual references . Sure there was sex , but you can't see a thing , and it got truncated badly anyway . Why can't the censors get straight to the point that it's M18 - Pro-Cigarette movie , which would align with local laws that cigarettes cannot be sold to those under 18 years of age ? One wonders . Then again , as addressed in the movie , I liked the part where there was a commotion over the effectiveness of having horrible pictures of death printed on the cigarette boxes . You must watch and see if you agree with the arguments presented . But the bottom line is , it's all about choice . Everyone , unless you're extremely ignorant , should already be aware of the dangers . If you want to , go ahead . If not , that's fine too . Now where's my cigarette ? ( should I , too , stick an M18 warning or attach some grotesque pictures ? : P )
A Nutshell Review : The Longest Night in Shanghai	I won't deny that the draw toward this movie was its star billing with Zhao Wei in the leading role , playing a blue collar taxi driver in the city of Shanghai . But of course again to my surprise in not reading the fine print , I had to muster my limited abilities to read the subtitles of the movie , because this Japanese-Chinese co-production , came only with Chinese subtitles for its Japanese dialogue . But still , I managed to enjoy every moment of this incredibly romantic movie , though from the onset it might not look like one to begin with . There were some shades of Lost in Translation I guess , except that there's a persistent language barrier between the couple but that added to the charm because they had to rely on non-verbal communication to get their message through . Motoki Masahiro plays Japanese stylist extraordinaire Mizushima who comes to Shanghai for an exposition , but is clearly unhappy and indifferent during the trip . As it turned out he's facing some serious love triangle issues , and is re-examining his current relationship with his assistant , before deciding to take off to the streets on his own , getting lost in the process . Zhao Wei's Lin Xi is quite the reckless driver who has seen all kinds of action that happen at her cab's backseat , and is deliberately reckless in order to report back to the workshop to have an opportunity to talk to her Dylan Kuo's Dong Dong , the mechanic she admires , who is extremely skilled in really fast repairs . And of course a fated moment where she accidentally knocks Mizushima down , began an unforgettable night for both as they begin to hang out , at first with her sharing the sights and sounds of Shanghai , before his lack of cash led to abandonment , and slowly the building of a night of friendship amongst two strangers who each have issues of the heart to face up to , and from each other finding a pillar of strength . Zhao Wei definitely gave one of her more memorable performances here as a girl who couldn't find courage to express her feelings , only for her to suffer in silence in what could possibly be the last day to do so , while juggling with her brother's insistence to sell their house to put her on the wrong emotion . You'll probably feel as gutted as she did when she learns of Dong Dong's marriage , and finds every opportunity to get a glimpse of him from afar . Playing opposite her , Motoki Masahiro had an uphill battle to climb because his role is typical of a foreigner left on strange soils , and spends most of the time being exasperated by Li Xin's antics at trying to shake him off initially . Between the two , I still felt Li Xin's story being the stronger one , although both share some fantastic chemistry despite not being able to understand each other directly . Supporting characters come in the form of a mixture of Japanese and Chinese casts , from Sam Lee as a translator to Naoto Takenaka of Waterboys / Swing Girls fame , and even a two scene cameo by Kitty Zhang ! If there's one thing I attest to in this film , is how Chinese words are still applicable in the Japanese context . While the pronunciation is different , some words retain similar meaning , and this would prove useful for the two to form some communication when sharing their love lives with each other . And with this spending of quality time at random with each other , filled with spontaneity , naturally becomes the catalyst for what could be , and you'll soon find yourself rooting for these two to realize that they could have something good going for them in this one long night they spend together . This was one of the more enjoyable festivals that I've attended this year , given that I've actually enjoyed every one of the selection , and that's something quite rare . For the romantics , this comes recommended for its premise , its dreamy eye candy cast , and especially its soundtrack and songs used in the film ( my favourite is Frally Hines ' Breathe ) . There are a number of iconic romantic moments which will probably move you , and it left you wanting more , especially with that last statement uttered at the end of the movie . I heart this one , really .
A Nutshell Review : Garden State	Garden State marks Zach Braff's feature film directorial debut , based upon a story written by him , and starring himself , Natalie Portman and Peter Sarsgaard . His later work The Last Kiss might have struck a chord in me with his characters looking at life entering the 30s , while this one's more about a younger man seeking some meaning and direction in his aimless life . Looking at it , Cameron Crowe's Elizabethtown might have some similarities , with the lead character leaving the city to return to the town he grew up in , when a death in the family occurs . Here , Braff's Andrew Largeman is a struggling actor in LA , going home upon hearing news of his mother's death . Back in town , and hooking up with old acquaintances like Mark ( Sarsgaard ) , he planned to stay for only 4 days , but found time hard to pass by especially when much of it involves drugs and booze , until he met the girl who would change his life forever - Samantha ( Portman ) . Portman really lights up the screen with her effervescent performance as a serial liar . Meeting Andrew in a psychiatric clinic , their banter in that scene is to die for ( complete with humping dog ) , as is their banter through the first half of the movie , bringing to mind the irrelevance of the conversational pieces ala Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise , but little of that sexual overtones . Like Kirsten Dunst's character in Elizabethtown , she provides reason and is the beacon of light at the end of the lead male character's fuzzy tunnel . Smart , sassy , everything a guy would want in a girl really . There are plenty of quirky moments in the movie that all but makes the movie seem like little short skits put together , but that's what makes the movie appealing , in that it doesn't stick to the usual narrative formula . It clearly stems from Braff's vision of translating most of his life's experiences into the movie . And the build up to the finale ( see , I still can't stop seeing those similarities ) involves a road trip of sorts , and though it doesn't cross state lines , they do make some visits , and have that feel good end to it all . I'll always like any movie so long as it has a scene which touches me , for reasons of my own , and here , Garden State has one which endeared itself to me . It's that scene which involves a hug and the notion of finding a safe-house , a home . I've been there and I know that feeling , and here , it gets translated perfectly . Coupled with an excellent soundtrack throughout the story , this is one heartwarming tale that doesn't deserve to be missed . Life's always complex , but it all boils down to how you want to deal with it . There are no clear answers , but lucky is the person if you have someone to walk those winding road ahead with .
A Nutshell Review : The Nativity Story	The Nativity Story is probably the most staged skit / play / musical in the month of December in most churches , and everyone who has been to Sunday School will definitely be all too familiar with the humble birth of Jesus Christ in Bethlehem . With Christmas becoming too much of a commercial farce ( in my opinion anyway ) , and with plenty of movies set during the Christmas holiday being a little lightweight , I thought this production is timely in remembering the origins of the festival . Not that it's 100 % accurate ( as in exactly as what's in the Bible ) , as it dramatizes certain events , but on the whole , the familiar plot elements are all there . While Mel Gibson's Passion of the Christ was a controversial piece with big named stars , and probably blown out of proportion with the general focus on its graphic violence , The Nativity Story in contrast is a humble , beautiful film that celebrates life , making its way to become the first feature film to premiere at the Vatican , compared to Passion's fixation with painful death . Director Catherine Hardwicke , in her third movie after Thirteen and Lords of Dogtown , begins the movie with the premonition of the coming of John the Baptist , Jesus ' cousin . Which I thought was a nice touch , rather than zooming it straight into our star parents Mary and Joseph . And she deftly brings out believability in both Keira Castle-Hughes as Mary , and Oscar Isaac as Joseph . Their Mary and Joseph come through as God-fearing and obeying , yet , like all humans , have the tendency to doubt . Between the two , I thought Isaac's Joseph had the meatier role as the man being entrusted the responsibility to take care of his wife and unborn child in times of strife , though of course , with God on their side , you'd come to expect nothing bad to befall them . All's not gloomy and serious in this story though , as comic relief is provided via the Three Wise Men , though I'm not really sure if it'll go down well with audiences . What I thoroughly enjoyed was to see certain milestone scenes from my faulty memory about the story , being played out on screen - the discovery of the virgin pregnancy , the visit of Gabriel , the census , and of course , the awesome scene at the Bethlehem manger , where the shepherds and the Wise Men arrive to pay homage . It's a tale of love and sacrifices made by the central characters of Mary and Joseph , of their unwavering belief and faith , and in my opinion , that's what made this telling of the Christmas story compelling to watch . And I liked the bit where discrimination crept in as a minor plot point . The movie has excellent production values and no effort is spared in creating the telling of the arrival of the King of Kings , especially in the costumes and sets department , be they computer generated cities , or rock-walled villages . The musical score also evokes the mood accurately , and if you listen attentively , you can hear whispers of familiar Christmas hymns and songs incorporated into it . While biblical movies of old like The Ten Commandments has itself a place amongst cinematic greats , The Nativity Story , if I may add , certainly has earned its keeps amongst movies for this holiday season of goodwill , by putting up an excellent movie on the origins of the festival .
A Nutshell Review : The Tin Mine	Set in 1950s after WWII , The Tin Mine is set in Southern Thailand , and chronicles the lives of tin miners as seen through the eyes of Arjin Panjapan ( Pijaya Vachajitpan ) , whose autobiographical short stories form the basis of this movie . It's no wonder , after watching this movie , that it's Thailand's official entry in the Best Foreign Language film category for this year's Academy Awards . Our protagonist , Arjin Panjapan , dropped out of the university and found himself looking for a job , any job , for survival . Leaving Bangkok , he makes it down south and hooks up with a group of tin miners , and because of his attitude of willing to do just about anything , he's hired on the spot , and there on learns that life is much more than just a piece of paper telling you about your educational qualification , but it's the ups and downs that one experiences , which will shape your life forever . What I particularly liked about this coming of age story , is actually how it's evenly mapped out into the 4 years of his life spent on the dredger and small mining town . From rookie to senior , the movie chronicles Arjin's life in short episodes , sometimes dwelling on certain memorable scenes , while others looked more into the characters he deals with everyday . In the tin mining town where everyone knows everyone else , and there are few gathering and entertainment spots , it's the characters that helped to bring out the flavours in the movie . Watching how life , no matter how hard and difficult it is , unfold on the dredger , makes you wonder if your own work environment has it that difficult . But it's always the camaraderie and team spirit , that helps make any environment , worth working in . Working hard and playing as hard should be the mantra , as we see how this is practiced throughout the ranks , never mind if one is the CEO , or the lowly servant . Infused with plenty of comedy and touching moments as well , the characters make this movie work . Like the scrooge like shopkeeper ( Jumpol Thongtan ) , the cock-sure supervisor who speaks a smattering mix of Thai and Behasa Melayu John ( Niran Sattar ) , and the burly yet child like assistant Kai ( Sonthaya Chitmanee ) . It's a pity that this movie only had a limited run in the theatres this year , and sadly I've actually missed it then . It's something worth watching in the cinemas , even though its narrative style sticks to the formula of coming of age films , this one had a certain heart and soul to it all . Watch it if you have any opportunity !
A Nutshell Review : Cloverfield	OMIGAWD ! OMIGAWD ! RUN ! OMIGAWD ! HELP ! GET THE HELL OUT ! OMIGAWD ! You'd be expecting to hear a lot of that , but not to fret , the rest of this review is spoiler free , guaranteed ! So we've weathered a six month wait since the teaser trailer premiered with Michael Bay's Transformers ( and draws some parallels , more on that later ) , and set the net buzzing with its many viral marketing sites appearing online , some red herrings , some dangling treats for those who can't wait to guess just what the movie will be titled ( well , just Cloverfield ) , and speculate on how the creature , if it was one , would look like . In recent history , Hollywood had tried this stunt before . Remember the Godzilla of 1998 ? Audiences were teased with a tail here , a roar there , and the filmmakers pretty much had the monster kept under tight wraps . Until it opened , and because it failed to live up to its hype , and didn't meet everyone's expectations of how the good old Japanese lizard would look like and behave , it tanked at the box office . Now , Cloverfield adopted similar strategies in having us hear a roar , and to witness its destructive powers , without a visual clue of what it looked like . Did it deliver ? Strangely enough , in my opinion , yes . Don't get me wrong , as I was leaning toward , and close to committing the cardinal sin of loathing a movie prior to experiencing it for myself first hand . I was apprehensive about watching something that perpetually couldn't keep still , and yet its technique adopted in presenting the movie worked perfectly . Like Blair Witch Project , we witness a series of events as unfolded through the lens of a hand-held consumer camera . In doing so , we forgo watching the movie from a third person perspective , and get plunged head on to first person instead . In this age of reality television , exclusive news scoops , youtube voyeurism , this shakycam technique works in putting us there where the action is , watching things unfold , raw . Imagine , just if , a big unknown were to happen . You push and probe , and frankly , get scared , wondering what to do next , worry about your loved ones , and probably would just follow the masses . Cloverfield took a simple , tried and tested story about a monster invasion in the scale of Godzilla's , and played with us - what if we were caught in the same situation with the monster pounding everything in sight - what would we do ? We take pictures for our blogs . Then run . I would put my neck out even to say that there is no grounds of comparison between Cloverfield , and one of my recent monster movie favourite The Host , simply because it's like comparing apples and oranges . The latter decided to show all very early in the movie , and had a strong focus and emphasis on the family of characters . Here , we don't feel much for the yuppies , we somehow become one of them , the videocam being our eyes and ears . And the creature , while we don't see it in full glory clearly , makes it all the more menacing . It plays on actual fear - we catch a glimpse , then quickly run away - and I thought it made the 1998 Godzilla look like a pussy with so much unexplained , that this uncertainty breeds and grows within you . But of course there will be some quick to dismiss this along the lines similar to those who dislike Transformers on the grounds that there isn't enough screen time for what mattered to them - " we're here to see robots / monsters , so give us the robots / monsters ! " As mentioned , there are nice moments where we sneak a peek at the rampaging creature , but there will be those whose appetite remain insatiate . Bear in mind though the point here is to experience what it would be like if you're stuck in a similar situation yourself ( wonder why this wasn't available in IMAX format ) , rather than watching in God mode , the narrative unfold in extended Starship Troopers style . And similar to Transformers , Odette Yustman is your new Megan Fox , except that she goes back to being the classic damsel . Cloverfield , if it makes enough money at the box office , leaves plenty of room with multiple doors wide open to possibilities of spin offs , prequels , sequels , and probably even a television series , animated or live action , or through any other visual medium . You can essentially repeat the same premise , but from different points of view - trust me , there are enough - and can probably build an entire community of creative work just around this one simple flint to sustain a campfire . OMIGAWD !
A Nutshell Review : Le Amiche	Lorenzo Codelli introduced this film as the only real literary adaptation by Michelangelo Antonioni , based on a short novel written by Cesare Pavese , whose short life but impressive career had a largely influential impact on Antonioni's works . It's a film about women ( the literal translation of the title of the story " Tra Donne Sole " means " Between Women Only " ) , in today's context known as the career girls , and it's also interesting to note that the co-writers of the screenplay were both female , each on opposite ends of the literary spectrum , one a " low-brow " pulp novelist , the other a " high-brow " writer . And I guess this pairing provided a very complete and enjoyable story which in today's contemporary context would classify if as a chick flick , only that this had plenty of intelligence and a lot of heart , and doesn't come across as a dumbed down condescending story with many cardboard characters thrown in just because . Opening with a sprightly tune , and set in Turn , La Amiche has plenty of insights into the female psyche , and I am quite surprised that it had stood the test of time ( more than 50 years ! ) to be as relevant today just as it was back in the mid-50s . The story follows Clelia ( Eleonara Rossi Drago ) from Rome , sent to Turin to supervise the setting up of a fashion boutique branch , and in her temporary stay at the city , befriends a group of high-society and debatable successful ladies through the attempted suicide of one of their clique members Rosetta ( Madeleine Fischer ) , who was found in her adjoining hotel room . From there we examine all their love lives , their work attitudes , their relationships with one another , the entire spectrum which while presenting themselves as little gossipy episodes that women might be prone to ( I'm readying myself to be pelted with rotten tomatoes with that statement ) , it always felt that each individual piece was a perfect contribution to the entirety of the movie , with nary a wasted scene , nor unnecessary subplots provided just to bloat the story . Antonioni has proved his deftness at handling an ensemble of characters ( much unlike his earlier movies , or his famed Trilogy where only a handful of characters get explored ) like the de-facto leader of the group Momina De Stefani ( Yvonne Fumeaux ) whose rich husband being always away on business provides her with an avenue for affairs and the need for constant emotional connection , or what I thought was the more interesting of the lot , was between successful ceramics artist Nene ( Valentina Cortese ) and her less successful painter fiancé Lorenzo ( Gabriele Ferzetti ) , who becomes romantically linked to Rosetta after painting her portrait , or rather , it was Rosetta who throws herself at him . Completing the group is Mariella ( Anna Maria Pancani ) , a flighty flirty woman with a devil-may-care attitude . For some reason I was concentrating on the Lorenzo-Nene-Rosetta story , because it was quite compelling to see how it played out and developed , having one of them throw the first salvo at attempted suicide . It also provided a platform to examine how relationships can be strained possibly through emotions like jealousy and one being envious of the other's success , and maybe taking it out on the person through other means , such as the breaking of hearts . Again like Story of a Love Affair ( I have no idea why I keep going back to this ) it was a similar situation presented , though more explicitly presented rather than leaving it to second guesses . The confrontational scene between Nene and Rosetta was the best in the movie in my opinion , and one of the best I have seen in movies where rival lovers have to confront each other on the truth of the situation , and you can hear the unbelievable groans of an audience upon its resolution , which was quite pathetic and awkwardly delivered , by today's standards . Which is what was intriguing , as it highlighted the perceived role of a woman back then , that the career first mindset was still a novelty , and standing behind your man was possibly the only acceptable societal norm . And it is this forward-thinking presentation and exploration of modern day themes even by today's standards , that make La Amiche a winner , being still relevant and all . Having 5 girls presented allowed for some comparisons over how some choose love over career despite expected setbacks which come part and parcel with it , and how some choose career over love , where one can excel in without the distractions of disappointment from the heart . Included as well is work ethics , when one doesn't have money as a prime motivator , one would wonder how the other non-tangible benefits would appeal to workers who have to turn up at work everyday , versus coming and going as they please , which I have experienced for myself ( as on the receiving end of having to manage the non-attendance of others ) . Other moments in the film that were equally enjoyable , include the fashion runway type shows in the old days , without the runway of course , where models have to present the clothes up close and personal in a closed door , intimate setting within the fashion boutique . And what was probably a precursor to the beach scene in L'Avventura get played out here , though it was a location for the rich folks to just stand around and flirt , with no real plan for a weekend getaway . It's still amazing how this particular little setting seem to squeeze so much into it , providing a catalyst for future incidents to burst out from . Le Amiche will go down in my books as a story starring women , about women and for women that is still highly relevant in today's society . It has withstood the test of time perfectly , and its exploration of women , their relationships , their attitudes that differ depending on either their single or married status , is an amalgamation of keen observations that make this an enjoyable a must-watch , peppered with good punctuations of humour throughout .
A Nutshell Review : Priceless	Transportation S$3 . 00 Movie Ticket S$9 . 00 Fried Chicken S$3 . 80 A Good Movie That Entertains ? Priceless . Directed by Pierre Salvadori , Pricess is one heck of a delightful gem . It is playful , cheeky , and boasts excellent chemistry between its leads , which is crucial to pull off a romantic comedy so dependent on their banter and interaction . Audrey Tautou plays Irene , a high maintenance gold digging prostitute who flits from one elderly man to another , in the hopes of seducing and convincing them into marriage , while in the meantime milking all she could from their company . It's haute fashion label dropping , living the high life in expensive hotel suites , for free . In an uncontrollable one night stand , she hooks up with waiter Jean ( Gad Elmaleh ) , who while is totally out of her league , falls hard for her , and becomes a constant thorn in her side as she goes about her mission in life . Not your usual romance movie where the bickering couple are expected to kiss , make up , and bicker some more , Priceless does two things in its narrative . One , in its reminder to the male suckers out there to be wary of high maintenance women - if you don't have what it takes ( and that simply means a really fat bankroll ) , forget about it , as she'll drain your finances as simply as it takes to gulp down a glass of water . Two , perhaps it really does pay for those who are kept men and women , if they don't mind trading their bodies for material pleasures that a rich life can offer . And from adversaries to partners in crime , Priceless sprinkles its narrative with scenes like from The Guru , where tips and tricks of the trade are shared , and played for laughs . And this is especially so with Jean's natural charms mixed with Mr Bean like demeanor . Kudos actually to actor Gad Elmaleh , who throws this constant innocent blank look , when he's hamming it up pretending to be loaded , or practising turning on his charms ( consciously or otherwise ) . He brings to Jean a sense of helplessness in falling for the woman of his dreams much against his finances , and gives Jean that chivalrous character that will surely win many over . Fans of Audrey Tautou will reminisce her portrayal as Irene to be similar to the quirky Amelie , only that this time round , she's the complete slut whom you pity for having such a materialistic nature . Her plunging necklines all the way down to the navel will no doubt raise temperatures , and while noticeably older , has brought about a sense of maturity from giggling girl to all woman . Peppered with an excellent soundtrack , the best songs were kept for a party scene , and for as many party scenes featured in various movies , I'd rate this one as one of the most interesting , thanks to the key music , characters , and the scene that plays out just right . With so many elements working in its favour , I'd rate this as a contender for the top movies of this year . Don't let this movie slip pass you in this crowded blockbuster summer !
A Nutshell Review : The Secret Life of Bees	It's been two years since we last saw Dakota Fanning on the big screen here , in a film which was a adaptation of the literary classic Charlotte's Web . And what a career it had been for this child actress , now an adolescent , to have grown from scream queen ( no thanks to her stint under Spielberg's War of the Worlds ) to one controversial role in Hounddogs , which I doubt would make it to our shores here . Based on a novel by Sue Monk Kidd and directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood , The Secret Life of Bees is one powerful drama above love and the looking for love , as well as running along the theme of forgiveness and reconciliation . It's easy to dismiss this as a chick flick because of its predominantly female cast , but that would be a mistake to make in making it an excuse to miss this film altogether . For all its worth , it's chock full of extremely well delivered performances from veterans such as Fanning herself , together with Queen Latifah , Jennifer Hudson ( proving that she's no flash in the pan ) , Sophie Okonedo , Paul Bettany and even Alicia Keys ! Set in the time of Summer in 1964 Southern USA where the Civil Rights Act was just signed and in effect , the sentiments amongst the racist bigots still run high in a charged environment still hanging onto their old segregated ways . Fanning's Lily Owens carries the weight of her guilt buried deep in her subconscious from a tragic event that happened when she was four , and ten years later , after receiving the last straw of punishment from her abusive dad ( Bettany ) , runs away with her caretaker Rosaleen ( Hudson ) . As if led by an invisible hand , they soon find themselves under the extreme goodwill of the Boatwright sisters , who earn a living through the cultivation of bees for honey , and a series of incidents that bring about some tying of loose ends , and the discovery that these strangers do tie back to Lily's own quest to finding out the truth about her mom , to debunk the lies as told by her father . And of course this allows opportunity for some serious girl power bonding between the characters as they find that they have a lot more in common , as well as the sharing and spreading of love through their ranks . The trump card that this movie has , is the excellent performances by the ensemble cast . Fanning leads the pack and gives a wonderful moving performance as the gangling Lily , who thinks that she's quite a jinx with plenty of bad karma to go around , bringing about unfortunate happenings to her hosts which provide the dramatic twists and turns to what would otherwise be a flat movie . Jennifer Hudson had much to do in the first act , though her character got quite muted by the time the trio of the Boatwright sisters August ( Latifah ) , June ( Keys ) and Okonedo ( May ) come along . Queen Latifah brings about some serious gravitas in her role as the eldest with the largest heart , and you cannot deny her chemistry with Fanning . Keys on the other hand plays the sister the exact opposite of August , being aloof and starting off with intense suspicion as to the intent of their guests . And Okonedo's role could probably be the most unorthodox of the lot , a fragile soul who has her own wailing wall to deal with the harsh realities of life . The Secret Life of Bees is well worth the admission ticket , and you'll be hard pressed not to be touched by the film , or moved by the themes it explores , especially when the third act comes by leading to quite a number of powerful revelations and a solid conclusion . Set against its intended backdrop , it's a reminder of tolerance , which the world lacks these days , and of course it's not always hammering in such heavy themes as it has its fair share of romance as well , and for what it's worth , Fanning has her first on-screen romance in this movie , and if I'm right , has her first on-screen kiss as well . You might be surprised when I say this , but this film has won me over enough for it to be considered as a contender when I shortlist my list of ten top films of the year . Definitely recommended !
A Nutshell Review : ( DVD ) In the Mood for Love ( 2000 )	It's beautifully depressing . How someone you come to love , in a relationship that's forbidden and socially frowned upon from the onset , has decidedly moved on , while you cling onto and yet distract yourself from it , until the day you finally choose to call it quits , by trying hard to forget the bittersweet memories . That basically summed up the storyline in Wong Kar-wai's movie , with the title from a song of the same name , it's all about the mood . And key to bringing this mood to life , is the excellent production sets , art direction and costumes . Accurate to the littlest detail of how a 60s Shanghainese community in Hong Kong lived , I couldn't help but smile at the presence of an " amah " , because I grew up as a toddler with one , kind of . And the language adds that bit of authenticity too . This movie did wonders for the cheong-sam , having Maggie Cheung appearing in different ones in most scenes to highlight time progression . And what is mood without the necessary music to punctuate the visually beautiful shots , by long time cinematographer and collaborator Christopher Doyle , and Lee Pin Bing ? It's half the battle won in my opinion , that the musical pieces fill the gaps which lack dialogue and compliments the slow cinematic shots , and I'm addicted to the waltz of the main love theme . But it's one thing to have excellent music , and another when the music , effects and ambient noise are able to carry the entire movie on its own ( you can select this audio track option from the Criterion Collection DVD ) . Now that the obvious statements about music , sets , costumes are out of the way , all these come to naught without a story . I'm glad that most of the scenes which were cut off , were done so , as they were quite cheesy , though humorous , and what remained from the 15 months production , tells a very mature , measured story on forbidden love in society's eyes , friendship and then more . There are plenty of material here which 2046 , another movie which I enjoyed , had referenced , adapted and complimented , such as the hotel room , the writer in Chow Mo-wan ( Tony Leung ) , and his attitude in the sequel . One of my earlier Wong Kar-wai movies which I watched as a teen in the cinemas is Days of Being WIld , starring an ensemble cast which included Maggie Cheung , here as Mrs Chan , though I'd like to think of her movie's character here , as an extension of Su Li-zhen in Days ( actually Wong provided her that character as a reference point when Maggie was asking incessantly questions about her character ) . And Tony's character in Days , a last moment cameo like appearance supposedly about a gambler in a never-made sequel , I'd liken it to Chow here , so in my own way , these movies form a loose trilogy . For those who have already watched the Korean movie April Snow , you would already realize that it borrows from the same theme of two characters , chancing upon each other by Fate , and learning that their respective spouses were having an affair with each other . While April Snow went for the common jugular in having the cheated upon spouses go head on with each other , In the Mood tackles it way too differently , providing loads of tension , and subtle teases , negating your want of the leads to develop their friendship into something more . And therein lies the strength of the movie . How Chow and Mrs Chan develop an unlikely friendship , which hints strongly at how it all could have been , under a 60s conservative environment , where they have to restrain their feelings for each other under society's judging eyes . Living in a communal environment too doesn't help their cause , even though it is pure to begin with - 2 lonely people , betrayed , and at times , tempted to take that leap of faith to challenge societal norms about love . Thankfully , potentially confusing ideas were not fully developed or made the final cut . There were thoughts to have the respective cheating spouses played by the same actors , but that would truly add to the confusion , The idea was developed separately into the " what could have been " and played out as various " rehearsals " as Chow and Mrs Chan try in their earlier quest to find out the whys and the hows their spouses could have gotten together , known each other , and started off the affair , but themselves vowing that they will never go down the same path . So in this vow already laid the foundations of how their friendship would be , and set a line in which their friendship could not cross nor develop into something more . And it's sometimes ironic too , that Mrs Chan , in her job , assists her boss in covering up his affairs . Kinda like a what-goes-around-comes-around . There are plenty of imagery throughout the movie that one could look into and try and interpret . I'd take forever in trying to list down all of mine , perhaps I'll do so one day when I own the DVD ( saving to get my copy ! ) , but I particularly liked the one at the restaurant where they finally learnt about their spouse's affair , and that long walk back home , where they walk , from out of step , into tandem . It's a becoming of 2 to 1 , where lonely persons find solace in each other's company , especially in the scenes after . Anyway , all said , I love the movie , and it ranks up there with my all time favourites . If you were to watch it , make it none other than the Criterion Collection . ( I'm not advertising for them , but I feel that this edition would help the viewer to appreciate the many rich layers more ) .
A Nutshell Review : Flags of Our Fathers	I nodded in agreement when it was mentioned a single photo taken during combat has the power to make or break a war . At a time when the war chest is drained and the battle seemed to be drawn out longer than expected , you need public support to cough out funds and make donations to the manufacturing of arms . In the dying days of WWII , that photo you see above , gave reason to galvanize the American public into making donations for that final push . Now think Abu Graib . Nuff said , on its adverse impact to the war machinery . For WWII movies , the Pacific theatre has arguably fewer number of films made by the West , especially those whose focus is on the ground troops , as compared to the European theatre , and possibly could be due to the availability of locales , as well as budget and ( non ) permission to film at the actual place . The Iwo Jima here is a substitute backdrop , not the real Iwo Jima with black beaches that you can see right after the end credits roll , as if in silent meditation of the soldiers on both sides who had given up their lives fighting for their cause . And the Battle of Iwo Jima had its historical significance given it's the first landing of Allied troops on Japanese soil , and one of the bloodiest yet with high casualties on both sides . It also opened up the American eyes to the tenacity of the Japanese troops and their relentless defence of the homeland from invasion , in a Digital Domain CGI-created massive naval beach landing . Those looking for recreated battle scenes will probably not be disappointed with the level of detail shown in Flags , like the weapons , and the infamous use of flamethrowers to smoke out hidden troops in bunkers . But this movie is not an all out action film . It's not a macro look at how the Allies secured their first foothold in Japanese soil . Rather , it takes a very personal look at the surviving men who hoisted the American flag over a prominent knoll in Iwo Jima . While there are countless of versions of the circumstances surrounding this lifting of a symbol , be it for morale boosting purpose , or politics , or for abstract ideals like hope , the definitive version as recounted in this story is actually quite ordinary , fueled by a mix of human desire for something monumental , as well as the listening to orders to a T . Told in a non linear fashion with flashbacks and voiceovers , it is extremely difficult that you'll be bored by the movie , unless your expectations have been set the wrong way . There is plenty of material and themes that the movie touched upon , although it can be argued that each doesn't necessarily have enough focus , issues like racism and prejudice . What makes this film compelling is the story of the survivors , being whisked back to the States to be part of propaganda to raise funds . Accuracy and accountability take the backseat against the hail of heroism , and it evolves very quickly into a media circus . Flags examines the lives of those in the photo who survived the battle , their reluctance to be called heroes , the demons that they faced while on the battlefield , the constant reminder to kill or be killed , the lies they have to tell to sell , and their sense of morality sacrificed for the lesser of two evils . Being soldiers , they have to do listen to orders , even if at the moment , it sounds absurd ( I believe those who have been through service in the armed forces will agree on this ) . It is the conflict , and the need to lie through their teeth , which makes it all the more a sorrowful struggle , especially when you have to deny a fellow brother his moment of recognition , and denying his family the need for closure . And of course , we all know how fickle the press can be . On one hand they can praise you , on the other , someone's always looking at ways to demean and cast doubts . Flavours of the moment , potshots of controversy like whether the picture was staged , ring to mind that icons can never escape from the cynical eye . Politicians , rich businessmen and the military brass too are cast in none too positive light , as they get portrayed as men who like association with power , fame , and glory . Clint Eastwood again never ceases to amaze me . Here's the star of spaghetti westerns , Dirty Harry himself , who has aged but still showing no signs of slowing down . Like fine wine , he has started to show his talents in the films he makes , and award winning critically acclaimed ones too . But what I'm really pleasantly and thoroughly enjoyed , is the score that he wrote for Flags . It's restrained , yet powerful , kept simple in instrument , yet never lacking in grandeur . Being a filmmaker is one thing , but having contribute to a highly effective score complimenting the movie , is another . Not many can do that . Flags of Our Fathers is a must watch , and I'm already eagerly anticipating the companion movie , with viewpoints from the Japanese , fighting the same war , in Letters From Iwo Jima , and it should be equally powerful .
A Nutshell Review : Sideways	( With this movie , I've completed my essential viewing of all the Best Picture Nominees for the 77th Annual Academy Awards , and this review is one the most personal I've written ) Wine lovers unite ! There isn't , in my recent memory , a show that celebrates wine , vineyards and grapes , like this one does . Scattered throughout as part of the narrative are so many wine terms , vintage bottles , and wine tasting , that the amateur me can find hard to grasp . Fear not though , as this show can still grow on you . We follow the road trip of 2 best buddies Miles and Jack , for a week , down to the Californian vineyards , before Jack's marriage when he gets back . Kinda like an extended bachelor's party , Miles ' idea of fun - that being long sessions of male bonding over wine tasting sessions , rounds of golf , and more drinks over night time chill out hours . However , Jack has a different idea of fun - that of having final flings and sowing his wild oats before committing himself to marriage . So while we see clash of ideas and mindsets , their strong friendship enables them to compromise and help each other during the various scenarios they encounter in their road trip . Essentially , this movie is also about relationships - that between the 2 buddies , that between Jack and his " fling " Stephanie , who of course he didn't tell that he's getting married once the week is over , and that between Miles and Maya . Which led me to identify with the 2 main male leads . Jack , the once famous soap opera actor , lives his life by his instinct . He goes with his gut and impulse , and enjoys a good time . My friends can probably identify this part of me , the go-getter , the thrill-seeker . However , this can sometimes lead you to sticky situations , and you'll require your best buddies to bail you out of the rut . Many hilarious moments arise from Jack's desperation in getting laid , in getting Miles laid as well , and his deception towards both his wife-to-be , and Stephanie . Unless he's decapitated , he'll never learn his lesson , and would still want to go for the final " kill " - the final scene of trouble that he gets into , is one of the best in the movie . Closer friends will probably see me in Miles , the struggling writer , who still harbours feelings for his ex ( wife that is ) . He goes into a frenzy when Jack tells him his ex-wife has already re-married . He is chronically depressed , that he screwed up his own marriage . To make things worse , Jack has invited Miles ' ex-wife and new husband to his wedding ceremony , which led to Jack wanting to back out of attending , well , almost , to avoid meeting the couple . Jack's advice to Miles is to move on , and he will help him do so . However , Miles just refuses to accept the fact , and allows depression to slowly creep into all other aspects of his life , severely affecting his confidence and attitude . Until of course , he meets Maya , and starts to seriously think about starting afresh . Despite the slow introduction of about 10 minutes , the show picks up pace once Miles and Jack hit the road . The down-to-earthness characters and dialogue will draw you into the movie , though some in the audience might think that the ending has left them hanging . A word of caution - in my opinion , it's deliberately done so , for YOU to decide what kinda ending YOU would prefer , and that will depend on whether you're a Jack , or a Miles kinda person . Don't let this underdog movie ( amongst the other heavyweight Oscar nominees ) slip by , go catch it in a theatre near you !
A Nutshell Review : Cashback	How can anyone miss the poster for Cashback ? Featuring a beautiful blonde in a supermarket who's almost naked from the waist up , her modesty protected by the words of the title , I guess you're forgiven if you mistake this for some low brow sex movie . But Cashback is anything but low brow , and sex is just a small part of the equation . Based on a short film of the same name written and directed by Sean Ellis , this is easily one of my favourite movies this year . It's intelligent , sexy , and nothing as raunchy as the poster would suggest , but full of little elements of surprises that connected , some of which are wickedly naughty . Cashback is a beautiful romantic comedy , filled with fantastical bits which elevated it to another plane altogether . There are some technically brilliant transitional and special effects that do make you go wild , but at its core , it's the story it had to tell that truly wowed me . Although it's a romantic film , it's firmly rooted in the pain of a breakup . Anyone who's gone through one , will know that feeling of despair , and hopelessness that life seem to have taken a turn into . And our protagonist Ben Willis ( Sean Biggerstaff ) is such , when we witness his ( literally ) painful split with his girl Suzy ( Michelle Ryan ) . For the first 10 minutes , I could totally identify with Ben , his thought processes , feelings , and his suffering . Ben suffered from insomnia , and is trying hard to find ways to pass the time . Since he couldn't sleep , he found the perfect win-win solution , and that is to utilize the time to earn some money , cashback , if you will , for services rendered . It's about finding our own space to pass time , to keep ourselves occupied , and to while away the idle moments instead of wasting time thinking about the what-ifs . Getting cashback of course is an incentive , but never the prime motivation . I could tell you all about the setting up of A Nutshell Review , but that's another story ( along the same veins ) for another day . Like my other favourite British movie of this year ( Hot Fuzz ) , Cashback has its primary setting in a supermarket , where Ben ends up in , working the graveyard hours of a 24hrs chain . Thanks to its quirky manager and madcap co-workers , there's no lack of shenanigans that they get themselves into , and we spend time with Ben as he explores and studies how each of them deals with the mundaneness of their lives . And a supermarket checkout girl , Sharon Pintey ( Emilia Fox ) , catches his attention , but is he ready to embark on another round of relationship ? Cashback has plenty of keen observations of love and life in general , coupled with its witty dialogue and dark sense of humour . But it's not rapid-fire pacing all the way , as the quiet and contemplative moments far outweigh those scenes , and pave the way for some meditation within yourself . Like I said , I found the story easy to connect to , and these moments allowed some time to ponder and draw parallels . The last third of the movie is simply powerful , and coupled with Ben's imaginative ability ( which I will not reveal just what ) , it totally moved me , and sounds out some sliver of hope . And what of the nudity ? Sure it was slightly edited here , but I thought there's nothing to fuss about . It's true that the female form is beautiful , and this film provides that sense of appreciation through Ben's artistic talent ( and of course , the camera angles , the lingering moments , etc ) . It's lovely , but never in a pornographic way , Think of it as visiting a nude art gallery , and you get the drift of how nudity's treated in the movie . With an excellent soundtrack to accompany the story , I felt that Cashback has all the ingredients of a hit movie , with a strong story , wonderful characterization ( a mixture of key characters and caricatures ) and absolutely lovely production values . For those who's fallen out of love , Ben is certainly someone whom you'll root for to pull himself out of the rut , and one whom you'll encourage to embark on another romantic journey in all earnestness with a person he fancies , contrary to the advice given by his best friend who seem to have a problem eating his own cooking , so to speak . While it's a piece about the dread in relationships , of breaking up , what you do and how you handle the pain , it also comes with a picture of hope . It's a simple story , yet emotionally powerful without being overly sentimental , predictable or cheesy . I've so many favourite moments in this movie , that I'll be more than tempted to buy the DVD when it's out . And it certainly is a strong contender for my movie of the year 2007 ! Highly recommended , and you must watch this film before it disappears from our screens !
A Nutshell Review : Taken	It's been just too long waiting for an action thriller that will knock my socks off , given too many bland attempts that left me wondering if the genre is too tired for my liking , with nothing left to wow . Then comes the Europa Corp team of Pierre Morel directing a Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen story , and Taken now ranks as one of my contemporary favourites for its simple story executed with so much style and gripping pace , that you'll be left breathless by the time the end credits roll . The trailer had one of the best monologues that I'm sure would have put many in the theatres , and probably be representative of the film . You have a stoic looking Liam Neeson as a father who tells the stranger at the end of the other line the conditions that the game will be played in , with perhaps bluff calling against bluff , only for the challenge and gauntlet to be thrown . From then on it's a non-stop adrenaline rush because this daddy happens to be a top ex-covert operative for the US government , so the bad guys essentially have chosen a wrong opponent to play the game with . The story worked well in dipping into some familiar fears , where daddy's little girl Kim ( Maggie Grace ) tells her dad lie after lie so as to cover up her tracks in wanting to do things she knows he would disapprove of . Such as , in this case , going on a tour of museums in Paris supposedly , rather than letting him know of her intent of being a groupie with friend Amanda ( Katie Cassidy ) chasing U2 all over Europe . Some may dismiss this fear as paranoia , but I think that heightened sense of awareness is a by product occupational hazard , and it's always better to err on the side of caution . For any parent who are confident of their kid's conduct , there is absolutely no guarantees that their kids ' friends would toe the same line , and there are often those who are magnets for trouble due to their thrill seeking . As is in this case where you see supposed safeguards to lower risks being systematically peeled away . With his reluctant consent and lessons being thrown in on very simple survival tips ( that would even serve well in real life ) , things still go wrong according to Murphy , and Liam Neeson's Brian has to race against time in finding a needle in the perennial haystack , relying on contacts and skills built over the years in carrying out government missions of prevention to save masses , now to put them into something more personal when addressing what could be any parent's worst nightmare , in having their daughters sold to the sex slave trade . Action-wise , Morel employs a whole host of fights ranging from gun battles , knives and the good ol ' fisticuffs , with Neeson employing some cool Shinsai Goshin Kai moves for close quarter combats to take out opponents . You might balk at how it's probably another one man army movie with the hero ripping through the streets of Paris , but this borders close to the Jason Bourne movies in the way opponents are dispatched without remorse and without much bullshit . It's clinical as it is deadly , just the way I suppose anyone would do so without the very hokey monologues that plague lesser films prior to each kill . The action direction was top notch without resorting to cheap MTV styled quick cuts , and had kept the shaky-cam syndrome at bay , which in turn provided for a pure adrenaline rush for action junkies out there . Taken well deserved its accolades and I say again , one of the best action thrillers to have hit the screen of late after a number of bland peers . I highly recommend this and it's a shoo-in as a contender for top films of this year . See if you can spot that SQ plane flying overhead in a scene too !
A Nutshell Review : Tropic Thunder	First of all , the goodies begin even before the main movie starts proper , with some hilarious fake ads and trailers just like Tarantino and Rodriguez's Grindhouse features which fabricated some material of its own , so don't be a dweeb and be late for the movie . Now that the public service reminder is out of the way , Tropic Thunder managed to live up to its hype , which in my personal opinion is a bit difficult these days because the marketing folks usually put the best bits in the trailers so that there's no more surprises left , or that the narrative actually fizzles out into mediocrity , losing steam halfway through the movie . Thankfully , this movie managed to pace and therefore sustain itself right through to the ending . There were a couple of plus points in the movie that made it rewarding to sit through . First of all , the movie satirizes almost everything that makes up the Hollywood film industry , with some keen poking of fun from the actors to the crew , from agents to the studio executives , not to mention relatively direct spoofs of Vietnam War movies like Platoon and Apocalypse Now . Then you also have the ensemble characters who add plenty of dimensional flavour and brought to life by their respective cast . Typical characters for ensemble movies get included , ranging from the action hero , the comedian , the character actor , the rapper turned actor and the newbie teenager on the cusp of his first big memorable break . While the keyart might have only Stiller , Downey Jr and Black on its marquee , the supporting roles and cameos also earn as much respect in delivering this movie , especially an almost unrecognizable Tom Cruise , who dons a bodysuit to hide his pretty boy looks ( not the first time he's done in , ala Vanilla Sky ) , and possessing the rare gift of incessant swearing which I haven't seen him do since Born on the Fourth of July . His character , sleazy studio executive Les Grossman , gets my thumbs up for lighting up the screen each time he's on , and probably had single handedly stole the thunder ( pardon the pun ) from the main leads , which I thought director Ben Stiller had realized the campiness of this role , that he decided it should be milked a lot more . While he plays against type , I doubt Cruise will get any Oscar nods for this insane role , but there's always MTV to show its appreciation to his madcap antics done right , for a role and not on a couch . Besides his supporting role , there were also others such as Steve Coogan as the rookie English director having to control his prima donna actors , and also to try and keep the movie from spiralling further out of budget and schedule , and Nick Nolte as Four Leaf Tayback , a Vietnam Vet who lost 2 of his hands , whose book the movie Tropic Thunder is based on , given the industry's raid on books and graphic novel material to make movies , if not going down the path of remakes . Look out also for plenty of cameos such as Jennifer Love Hewitt , Alicia Silverstone , Jon Voight , and Tobey Maguire if you're on time to view those fake trailers . And what of the leads ? I thought they probably had a good time making this movie , hamming up for their characters and providing some crazy laughs . Ben Stiller leads the team as Tugg Speedman , the action hero who desperately needs a hit to repair his reputation after a disastrous dramatic stint in which he plays the much-frowned upon retarded role of Jack the simpleton . His character is a little of a show-off , and he managed some superb nuances in his persona as the cock-sure action person . Robert Downey Jr plays his opposite number , the exaggerated multiple-award winner Kirk Lazarus who stays in character all the time until the release of the DVD commentary , undergoes a controversial surgical procedure to help him ease into the role , and shares probably some of the best scenes with Stiller in the movie . Move aside Tony Stark / Iron Man , Downey Jr's role here is more memorable ! And to round things off , Jack Black got quite muted as the fart-it-all comedian who doesn't feel appreciated and is a drug junkie , Jay Baruchel as the teenage nobody hoping that his role here amongst the heavyweights would get him laid , and Brandon T Jackson's Alpa Chino just cracks me up on his name alone , as the rapper turned actor slyly promoting the beverage he endorses , and has a very fleeting suggestion of homosexuality ( somehow the rage these days in comedies ? ) Definitely justifies its accolades as one of the comedies of the year . Get some !
A Nutshell Review : Lady in the Water	I love it . And in the spirit of all movies Shyamalan , I'll keep mum about the plot . I loved the pace , the control , and the development of how the plot unfolded . It had a whodunnit feel of a mystery that is carefully revealed layer by layer . The ensemble cast and characters were fantastic , with each character possessing usefulness to the story and to peer characters , and their eccentricities make them a joy to watch . You have the Korean mother and daughter , the Vietnam Vet , a father and son , a new neighbour , a group of cock-talkers , a guy who works out only his right side , and so on . Although most of them are one - dimensional , they are no less than endearing in their own way , like those in Cocoon or Batteries Not Included . I love the superb acting by the main leads of Paul Giamatti , who's fast becoming one of my favourite character actors , and in here , provided his character Cleveland Heep with much emotional baggage , pain and that almost natural stammer when nervous , and Bryce Dallas Howard , her Lady in the Water , name Story , is so beautiful , yet so enchantingly vulnerable . Both anchor this movie well and brought about believable character development , or in the case of Story , that oracle air of wisdom , wit and fear of the unknown . I love the special effects , done no less by Industrial Light and Magic . They're a pretty sight , even though some scenes were dark , literally and figuratively . Cinematography was done by Christopher Doyle , so those in Asia should already well be aware what he's capable of . There's a major departure from his previous films , which I think is probably good to keep things refreshing for the moment . Some points and scenes in the movie are so deceptively simple that you will almost guess the outcome before the next scene transition . The movie ended the way it should , instead of relying on the " next big gimmick " . And probably bad news of those who loathe directors cameo-ing in the own movies , well , this time round , Shyamalan has quite a significant role for himself . And I know why many critics out there didn't give this movie the rating it deserves . They are surprised at Shyamalan's audacity in taking a huge swipe at critics in general , since they have been highly critical of almost all his past works . It's an obvious no-holds-barred jibe at their anal characters of being high and mighty and of imposing their thoughts and opinions on others , when little do they know that their opinions mean squat most of the time . There's another cheeky reference too at romances in the rain , which I thought perhaps cinematographer Doyle would have found it amusing given his work on Wong Kar-wai's In the Mood for Love and 2046 ( citing these 2 as I've recently watched the former ) . But those aside , thank you M Night , for sharing with us a wonderful bedtime story , which I think will be repeated at bedtime to many children around the world . It's beautiful , simple , easy to grasp , and allows for good shuteye fantasy .
A Nutshell Review : Stardust	I approached Stardust with apprehension , because of late , fairy tale movies like Pan's Labyrinth , Mirrormask and Brothers Grimm somehow didn't appeal to me , even though they are helmed by acclaimed directors , and critically praised by many . Moreover , the movie had premiered in the US for ages now , and the trailer has been played too often over here , while waiting for the movie to make its debut , that it actually looked quiet tired . But I am extremely pleased to have stuck with my gut , and gone for the screening anyway , and boy , was I thoroughly surprised and entertained ! Let me say this - the trailer did not do the movie justice , being overly long , and cut in a rather plain manner that seemed to harp on the big names , and made it look pretty ordinary . Doubt not Neil Gaiman's creativity in crafting an adult fantastical fairy tale filled with witches , pirates , sword and sorcery , and beautiful people too , in a fictional land area in England separated by a wall , where inhabitants from one side is forbidden to cross over . For all the more recognizable names in this feature , Charlie Cox takes up the lead role of Tristan , a shopkeeper's assistant who is smitten with the lady in his life , Victoria ( Sienna Miller ) , to whom he vowed to bring back a falling star they witnessed in order to ask for her hand in marriage , and in time for her birthday . Naturally the lady thinks he , being the olden day wimp , probably couldn't do it , so in jest strikes that deal with him . But little does Tristan know that in crossing the wall , and meeting up with the fallen star Yvaine ( Claire Danes ) , his life will forever be changed through a series of adventures , involving a sisterhood of witches led by Michelle Pfeiffer ( on a revival after Hairspray ) who are after the heart of the fallen star because of immortality , Septimus ( Mark Strong ) in his quest to become King by retrieving a ruby now worn by Yvaine , and with allies such as Robert De Niro's Captain Shakespeare and his merry pirates aboard a flying ship . At its core , this is a whimsical love story , and I thought while predictable , was delivered most excellently . though your goosebumps won't have that much of a field day ( various characters were actually rolling their eyes at different junctures and situations in the movie ) . It translated the notion that one usually glows when one is in love and / or in the presence of a loved one , and here , it does so quite literally as well . It has a beautiful coherent story that you would expect of a fairy tale , and plenty of magical artifacts introduced through the course of the story , like any respectable and enjoyable story amongst its peers , do serve their purpose at the right time - there is no wastage , and everything impeccably planned out . The strength is indeed in the story , with unexpected twists to characters , though in its structure some might complain that it is predictable to a T , but yet it met expectations , and surpassed them . Visual effects were top notch and serve their purpose , and there's a fair bit of comedy courtesy of the princely ghouls . What made it a blast , were the actors , most of whom are big names in their own right . Ian McKellen lent his voice as the narrator , and Michelle Peiffer you just got salute for taking on a villainous role which doesn't stop poking fun at aging . Claire Danes was pretty as the wide eyed ingenue angel from above , and Charlie Cox opposite her do make a pretty couple . Peter O'Toole , Ricky Gervais and Rupert Everett had bit roles , but the one who stole the limelight was De Niro's pirate captain . Not that he does it in Jack Sparrow fashion , but here's a man whose first and foremost principle is impression , and you've just got to see him in action to believe ! Aarrr ! ! Nicely paced and never a dull moment , Stardust has bits of everything that made it a delight to watch - star power , story , magic , comedy , effects , intense buildups and moments , and the list goes on . If I may , then I must say I do enjoy the tried and tested moments that it tossed about on its notion of love - that sometimes you meet someone special quite oft by chance , and it'll take some time for you to realize that hey , the person standing in front of you is really that soul mate you're looking for . Call me a sucker for such predictable scenarios , but I like what I like , and I was impressed with how Stardust was packaged as a whole . It has been far too long that I've emerged from a fairy tale movie feeling so very pleased , and Stardust wins that honour of having put the faith for such movies back in me . As such , it wins a well deserved slot in my contender list for top 10 movies of the year . Don't miss this one when it premieres on Thursday !
A Nutshell Review : The Warlords	Two's a company and three's a crowd . In movieland , that is almost always true , with no black and white , but with shades of grey instead . Of late , period or martial chivalry movies either look aesthetically beautiful like Zhang Yimou's trilogy of Hero , House of Flying Daggers and Curse of the Golden Flower , or opt for the grittier , more down to earth look with plenty of dirt and grime like Battle of Wits . Director Peter Chan's The Warlords follows the latter with its strained colors and muck on everyone's face , in parallel of the grey that befalls everyone in this tale of a trio's struggles with the System , and amongst themselves . Those who are familiar with stories featuring similar themes like brotherly bonds , blood brothers and the likes , will find that The Warlords , when striped away to its core , conforms to the same . But what Peter Chan did , and I thought succeeded , was to fuse really hard core battle action sequences with character driven drama , and having the stellar leads of Andy Lau , Jet Li and Takeshi Kaneshiro play something quite unlike their usual on screen personae , well , except maybe Kaneshiro . Publicity talk has been rife of Jet Li's unbelievable pay package taking up almost 40 % of the production cost , but if that was true , I'd guess it must've been a reward to take on something risky ( to a screen idol that is ) , and as it turned out , it could instead be a career defining role for Li , who doesn't get as much opportunity to show off those slick martial arts moves , no doubt in part wanting to stick the movie as close to reality as possible ( bye , shawdowless kick ! ) Li opens the movie as a disgraced general Ma Xin Yi , who was betrayed and only survived a massacre of his troops by the cowardly act of playing dead ( Yes ! Jet Li , playing a coward , pretending to be dead ! Told you ! ) In his quest to survive incognito , he chances upon a bandit Zhang Wen Xiang , played by Kaneshiro , who acknowledges General Ma's fighting prowess , and recruits him to the gang of Lau's Cao Er-Hu . However , the bandit life is not for a man of war , who sees the poor bandit village getting their arses kicked when soldiers of a rival court raid them , and thus finds the catalyst to encourage the bandit men to draw salary and food , by joining the army . Suspicious and needing assurance of the General , the trio of Ma , Zhang and Cao sign a blood oath , and thus the blood brothers are born - one a charismatic leader , one a general looking to reclaim his honour , and one in every bonding , the earnest and faithful follower . As the story unfolds , you begin to see how de-facto leaders always feel threatened by young upstarts , both in the politics within the small band of brothers , and in the bigger picture with the court officials . With individuals , there's almost always a clash of ideals , with many methods available in achieving common objectives , and one man's insatiable ambition will put the others at risk in Machiavellian terms . Finding themselves stronger in unity , repeated success on the battlefield start to change folks and reveal true intentions . Even the rule of law established becomes subject to interpretation based on the moment's convenience , and core principles like honour and gentlemen's agreement get tossed out of the window . As innermost desires are revealed , you'll begin to see how seriously or not , the blood oath is being treated by each individual , especially when one finds the other being externally threatened , or betrayal of temptation in the highest order courtesy of female lead Xu Jinglei's Lian as the token flower amongst the thorns . However , the story bore strength in its presentation of key moments where you'll be called upon to question and even judge the characters , their decisions , and at times , forced to choose sides . You may be convinced by one argument , yet understand the necessity of why something else was done instead . And I'd think you'll probably won't stick to one side for the most parts , and such bringing out the shades of grey that you'll experience for yourself , if you happen to be in the shoes of the trio's foot soldiers . Naivety is truly unkind , and sometimes one is just a pawn in situations far beyond one's grasp , and you can see how this rings true for almost every character here . While it is easy to dwell on the battle sequences and make this one heck of an action romp in the veins of 300 ( ok , so this one had its " 108 heroes " moment in a nod towards probable upcoming Water Margin movies ) , which it did look to suspiciously tread along the same vein , I thought the filmmakers here were smart to know when to show gore , with the decapitations , piercings and the likes , to knowing when to retract such in your face moments for maximum effect . In the hands of a lesser director , perhaps a key brutal scene will mean to show the obvious full frontal , but in showing you something else instead , with focus on individual reactions and the reactions of compatriots at one point in time , I thought it achieved a more powerful effect , with the audience I'm with tonight completed dumbfounded and silent throughout the scene . A remake of sorts of Shaw Brothers ' Ci Ma some 35 years ago ( directed by Chang Cheh and starring David Chiang , Ti Lung and Chen Kuan Tai in the lead roles ) , Peter Chan has brought to us a worthy Chinese epic movie with lavish production values , and one deserving of being called a magnificent effort . And yes , this deserves a watch in seeing who's actually playing who , and with a stellar cast to boot , I don't see why not . Highly recommended !
A Nutshell Review : Knocked Up	Writer-director Judd Apatow is probably best known for last year's sleeper hit comedy The 40 Year Old Virgin , where Steve Carrell played the titular character whose friends tried to get him laid . In Knocked Up , most of the familiar faces in Virgin returns for Apatow's latest offering , this time with Seth Rogen cast as one of the protagonists who has his hands full when he learns that he's going to be a father . But here's the catch - the pregnancy is totally unplanned , and was a result of a drunken one-night stand . Knocked Up is fertile ( pardon the pun ) ground for comedy , and Apatow's script , while it doesn't have much slapstick , turns it on by having plenty of winning dialogue , as the film chronicles the entire 9 months of the pregnancy period . And at its core , it's a true blue romance movie , with some seriousness at the side as it takes a long hard look at modern relationships , and the challenges faced by the modern family . It's expectations versus sacrifice , and Apatow really nails it all in with aplomb . The entire film is witty and so spot on , it sometimes hurts when you see things happening on screen , happen so close to home . Seth Rogen stars as Ben Stone , an unemployed man living off his insurance benefits for having been hit by a truck . He spends the day idling with his geek friends , who together , are setting up an Internet website which documents the exact moments when actresses appear nude in movies . Simply put , he's your undesirable plumb nerd who girls wouldn't want to go near . But opposites attract , and in a moment of brilliance , he manages to snog Alison Scott ( Katherine Heigl ) , a beautiful executive for E ! Entertainment , the It-girl with a bright future ahead of her , until their unprotected tryst . So it's a tussle between the two who are poles apart , to try and learn more about each other , to see if they like each other enough to want to try and do something serious about their situation . To Alison , she's keeping the baby , and to Ben , he's in for the ride , if he can prove that he's serious about it . What I liked about the movie is the subtle reminder never to judge a book by its cover , that hey , geeks ( rule ) are just as fun to be with , despite their encyclopedic knowledge about totally random bits of trivia , and that they don't have model good looks . But more importantly , as I mentioned , it takes a good hard look at modern relationships , and contrasts this perfectly by having Alison's married sister Debbie ( Leslie Mann ) , sharing the spotlight as well , with Paul Rudd as Pete her husband . They seem like the perfect all-American family , but if you chip deeper into the psyche , you can see that all is not so well , and that is contributing to the fear factor our new couple are trying to grapple with . Like The 40 Year Old Virgin , Knocked Up has its fair share of geek jokes , tons of movie references that movie fans can cheer about , and a number of uncredited cameos who just are a hoot to watch . And Ben's posse of geek buddies just about steal almost every scene they're in , despite being a little too predictable with their weed-smoking , free-loving , frequent-cursing ways . Very rarely do comedies come with a lot of heart . Knocked Up balances fun and seriousness all too well , and as a result , with its feel good ending offering plenty of hope , makes this movie one of the best this year . Highly recommended !
