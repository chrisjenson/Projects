Get a life this movie is a poorly made , poor quality movie .	The above statement goes to the one obsessed fan who apparently written several reviews of this movie under different names and goes around blasting and writing to everyone who disagrees with his opinion . Apparently he would prefer to live in a society where only his matters and everyone must bow down before him . Well what to say about this movie . . . it is a very short , pointless anti something or another movie , possibly war or nukes , but lets face it all we got here is a missile that if launched would have no capabilities other than coming down again . It is way to small to be the highly specialized missile capable of knocking out any country you desire for you need a satellite to have something with that means and this weapon looks like a stick . For a better movie with an anti nuclear weapon message I would suggest Japan's own original " Godzilla " . Here we have a man moving his family into an army base with a bunch of other families to work on the weapon . Of course along with these families there is also a family with an out of work dad and his wife and step child , why they are on this top secret base is beyond me , I highly doubt a woman would be working in such a facility in the 50's but then what do I know I think this movie sucks and that means I am an idiot . The wife is annoying , but then again I think this is just the way she acts as if you had seen her in the equally as bad " The Screaming Skull " you would realize she is basically playing the same role . The kids are all annoying brats , and so is the rest of the cast . From the heavens comes a blob , which for no reason gets bigger and helps the kids disarm said nuclear device through magical means of unlocking a gate . Wow , isn't that exciting , apparently kids from the 50's thought watching a blob get bigger and gates unlocking made for the best movie ever ( well to the one disturbed fan it does ) . However , to me and most normal people this does not a good movie make . . . it makes for a very boring and pointless movie whose only redeeming value is that it is so absurdly done that you can make fun of it . A good message does not mean it is a good movie and one deranged fan who has probably 4 or 5 identities so he could pump up the score and write multiple reviews and say he disagrees with other reviews two or three times , makes for a person that probably should be put in a mental ward . And don't bother private messaging me psycho I have said my last words on this turkey " Space Children " .
Corman didn't have much space to work with .	Yes of all the things to notice about the flick the one that stood out for me is the fact the set had to be really small . When ever the characters went anywhere in the movie it seemed they only had to go a couple of steps to get there . Enough of that though I have a movie to review . This movie is a about two researchers and their attempt to send a prostitute back into one of her former lives . They suceed and she ends up as this gal who is imprisoned in the Tower of Death which strangely enough seems to have only one floor . She is accused of being a witch and must die . She escapes with the help from her future self and this messes everything up so that maybe her future self won't live . It gets even more jumbled by the end with one of the researchers going back to that time to . . . he really doesn't need to , but I guess he just wanted to check it out . Billy Barty appears in this one as an imp and you will meet the most annoying grave digger ever . Also , watch for the good looking evil witch who can change into muliple things . Not much to recommend here , unless you watch the MST 3000 version of this flick . One thing I did learn is that you can't take your clothes with you to the past , but you can take your watch apparently .
Santy Clause doesn't really conquer anyone .	This movie is dreadful , pure and simple and that is the nicest way I can describe it . From the annoying opening and ending theme , to the horrible production values , bad story , and inept actors this has to be the worst Christmas movie out there . And there have been some really bad Christmas movies . From the title , I was almost expecting something along the lines of that fake movie in " Scrooged " , the one with Lee Majors . However , this is just a very bad movie where martians want x-mas so they kidnap Santa . Not much in the way of fighting or conquering going on here . Santa is rather annoying , but he probably is the best actor in the film which is scary . And the less said about the one martian who dresses up as Santa the better . The child actors are not much better and there is really nothing to be said of the sets . Every thing here is rather cheap looking and there is a scene with a polar bear that is just to stupid looking , however it looks great next to the martian's robot . As for the plot , strictly by the numbers , nothing is going to surprise you here . And I know this is probably someone's favorite x-mas movie from their childhood and they are going to want to write me and tell me how this movie is about changing socialistic lifestyles through being more friendly , but please save your breath . I just thought this movie sucked and there is nothing anyone can say that will change my mind .
This is just terrible .	Simply put that is how I describe this one . None of the Supermans are really great , but they are ok . This one is just awful . . . I mean where do I begin . I might as well start with the budget . . . It just had to be extremely low . His flying looked worse in this than in the first one . Then there is the acting Reeve goes beyond mediocre in this one . . . here he sucks . I am guessing it was the director's job that made him tolerable in the first three . Not that anyone does a good job in this one including Gene Hackman who is also awful and just why did the feel the need to have Jon Cryer play his nephew ? Then the scientific errors . Somehow a strand of Superman's hair can hold up all this weight . . . I think it was a ton , but Lex Luthor cuts it with bolt cutters . Nuclear man takes a girl into space where there is plenty of air for her to breath apparently . And speaking of the villan , did they try to make him as lame as possible or what . This of course has to do with the plot , a whole movie devoted to telling us a nuclear war would be bad . . . Duh ! If Reeve thought this movie was going to cause world leaders to say " Gee , we shouldn't start a war and maybe we should disarm " , then he was fooling himself .
This Movie fails . . . on so many levels .	No matter how you look at this movie , it is just awful . If you view it as a horror , then it is an unscary movie with the monsters being hand puppets . If you look at it as a comedy , then you will notice most of the humor falls flat and is just lame . If it is a romance you will wonder why a guy would stay with such a Bch ! If you look at it as an action you can't really pull for the whiny hero . As you can see this movie just fails to deliver anything remotely entertaining . As mentioned the monsters are obvious puppets and this film was another attempt at a Gremlins type movie . This however has the worst looking monsters of that genre . Critters looked pretty good , so did the Ghoulies , heck even the puppets from the Munchies looked better than these . The characters in this film are thouroughly unlikable . The hero is a whiney security guard , his girlfriend is always complaining , they have a tramp friend who has a jerk military boyfriend , and another friend who is a spaz . At one point in the movie the hero and the military guy fight with rakes . . . this movie is just utterly stupid . I like the scene when they are in the dreaded club scum ( which is obviously not a club , but more likely a diner ) and the hero tells the waitress that none of them are 21 . Give me a break , I am 25 and I look younger than any of them .
Boy , this was sure mucked up .	I used to think it couldn't get any worse than Manos the Hands of Fate , that is until I saw the creeping terror . I am suprised it has such a high rating , but to each his own . One of the problems I had with this movie is there is virtully no diolouge . A narrator provides most of the commentary . He will explain in depth a conversation between actors in the movie . I am guessing they messed up the recording of the voices when filming and instead of getting all the actors and actresses back to rerecord they probably figured it would be cheaper to get a narrator . Then there is the monster . A monster so slow ( it does creep , you have to give it that ) that you wonder how anyone can be killed by it . You virtually have to stay in one place and wait for it to kill you . I am guessing there is a city ordinance in the town against running . And , of course , it looks bad too . This movie just doesn't have anything , no good characters , no real terror , no redeeming value . At least Manos had the great Torgo .
This was made in 1980 ?	Watching this one I thought early 70's late 60's , but this was released in 1980 ? This is a very bad film , it is really sad to see Donald Pleasence in this one , forced to dress in one stupid outfit after another . And what is up with the superheros costume . I have never seen a hero in slacks , a stupid shirt , and a fruity cape before . What is worse is his constant whinning , I was rooting for Donald to take over the world . And since when do pumas fly anyway ? Am I thinking of the right animal ? And I love it when he senses danger , he never senses it when people are right on him , but rather hours before hand it seems . Don't watch this one unless you watch the MST 3000 version .
Secret Agent Super Dragon . . . sounds like a cool , kick ass , spy movie ! ! !	Well it is not . Anything but , as this is another in a long line of Bond knock offs where they get a smug spy and think that is enough . They offer nothing in the way of action as the only action we get is a couple of fist fights and one tepid gun fight . I am still trying to figure out the plot to this one as there seems to be a secret agent who is coming out of retirement . He is trying to solve some sort of plague or something that has been causing people to go crazy , I think the source of this is a drug which may or may not be in chewing gum , or it is in vases . On the plus side we get to visit Holland . Seriously , though this movie is rather bad , it was not fun to watch with the exception of the very attractive ladies who accompanied our stupidly smug agent who also had an annoying sidekick that seemed to do more than said agent . The plot is nonexistent as it goes here and there , never revealing the leader of the sinister plot , only his art loving assistant as I am thinking they were planning to have sequels to this . Hopefully , there were not any and I would recommend to the makers of this film who are most likely dead . . . Don't title your movie Secret Agent Super Dragon unless you are planning to have some really cool fight scenes and some explosions .
They skipped part three and went straight to four .	Yes , there is no real part three in the series . There is a movie called " The Horror Show " that was called House 3 overseas so this one is called four , but " Horror Show " is not a true entry to the series . I have never seen that one though so I can't comment on it . I have seen this one , and it is terrible . About a family where the father dies in a car accident and the daughter is left paralyzed . The mother and daughter move into a house and all this strange things start to happen . Though nothing scary as this one is sort of a comedy , but it isn't funny . There are some bad scenes all around in this one as it also has a corporation that wants the house cause there is a well underneath and they want to dump waste there . Why is it these corporations always want to dump waste in movies ? What the heck do they manufacture that would create such stuff ? All in all a movie that you might as well ignore and skip , cause you wouldn't be missing much . There is a rather gross scene involving drool , and a rather stupid scene involving pizza . . . but these are the only memorable scenes in this turkey .
This movie is a " kick " all right . . . a kick in the gut .	Not really all that much to this movie . . . either a stunt racer or a stock car racer has a flaming car in the beginning of the movie , goes to bar , is approached by a biker gang who ruins his chances with a very lovely lady , offer him a job , he goes back to their place , refuses , the police ask him to accept their ya go ! ! ! What plays out is a very annoying little film that sees the hero not really do all that much and a biker gang that can kill and for some reason the police can not pin a crime on them . I am not sure why the female biker did what she did at the end , but hey it is a bad movie , you always get scenes that make little sense . I am still trying to figure out if I misheard it when they said the hero of the piece was a stunt car driver . They may have said stock car driver because why would a stunt racer be racing and I wouldn't think it would be all that uncommon for a stunt car to crash . The actors are bad , and all the bikers are pretty annoying and the hero is kind of incompetent . . . really this movie is not full of kicks but it is the pits .
Well it was better than two .	This movie is part of one of the worst set of trilogies ever made where all the movies somehow made it to the theater . This one is quite bad , but at least it isn't part two so no Roseanne doing the voice . Here we have Danny DeVito and Diane Keaton doing dogs voices . Not really worth watching and there are probably lots of dog movies that are better . This one has the family being hateful to each other again . Let's face it Travolta and Alley have to be the worst screen couple ever , they always have problems . All in all not worth watching , but at least it is more tolerable than part two , but I say skip the entire set movies as none of them are good .
Mystical shop of evil is more like it .	This is two tales fused together by Ernest Borgnaine . Actually , I think they were making a Merlin movie and said this sucks so lets by a short movie about an evil monkey toy made in the 1980s . What you get is in the first tale ; Merlin has just opened a shop that sells crap . A critic comes in and says as much . . . Merlin gives him a book to get even as this book is very special . The critic takes it home does some of the spells and promptly gets old . . . cause doing magic does that . There is also a plot in there where his wife is barren , this plot seems more appropriate for a Lifetime channel movie . This and that happen and we are supposed to be surprised by the ending to tale number one . Tale two has a thief for some reason stealing a toy monkey with cymbals and I am guessing he can travel through time cause in this tale it is 1983 . Actually this part of the movie is a short movie called the Devil's gift and not really part of the Merlin tale . It looks rather bad when they switch to Merlin from time to time when he is in 1996 asking people if they have seen his monkey . The monkey kills by banging cymbals , actually it reminded me of a Stephen King story I read . The monkey kills a kid's dog and goldfish , and even makes an attempt at the kid . All in all Merlin's shop seems more full of evil than mystical wonder . This is all apparently a script that the Borgnaine character has been working on and he tells it to a kid , but you can see why there were no takers , because this was a stinker .
Wow , never before has there been so many riveting desk scenes in one movie ! ! !	This movie actually starts out promisingly enough as they have a scene showing a smutty film shoot . You see a few girls dressed skimpily and while this obviously is not going to be a good movie , at least there will be something to look at . However what we get is basically no more scenes of this type as this movie is mainly against such evils as a female showing a little skin . So we basically have cops correlating the porn industry to murders and theft and all organized crime , of course they neglect to inform people that if you make something that people really want illegal organized crime moves in and makes a profit on it . Of course , let me not cheapen this fine movie by acting like it has any redeeming values or that it is a good movie to start a frank discussion , it just sucks . I mean from the random scenes here and there to scene after scene after scene of the two cops at that one desk ! ! ! This movie is very dull and to think it started with a rather nice looking gal running from apparently no one and then being killed the first moment she stops and then the cool shoot to desk scenes aplenty and the most shrilled voiced woman ever to be filmed on the big screen . Here is another film that makes another low budget murder mystery " the Dead Talk Back " seem like an Oscar caliber movie by comparison . . . I most certainly don't want to see another of Ed Wood's films unless of course he was less serious in his later works . I mean you are making a low budget piece of dung , just have fun and do crazy things , don't try to shove a message down the viewer's throat ! ! !
Pretty bad , but not the worst . . .	movie I have ever seen . Actually I find it one of the more entertaining episodes of MST 3000 I have seen . Not that it was good , but for anyone who has seen Manos : the Hands of Fate knows this one wasn't two bad . The monster in the movie looked terrible , everyone wore upsetting swim suits , and the plot was laughable . I still don't have a clue as to why they made the monster , they never really gave a good reason . The lead female had to be the scrawniest gal I have ever seen . They would have done better if they cast the gal that was killed at the beginning as the lead . On the plus side the dolphins acting was great ! ! !
This movie is kind of unpleasant .	This one is said to be a prequel to the first Amityville , but there are a lot of differences and it doesn't really play out like one . I missed the first part of the first movie that showed the killings cause AMC advertised the movie to start at a different time , but in this one the murders are shown again , but not like they were in the first one . For one the guy who did the killings looked older in the first one from the picture in the paper , and another the boy was said to have been arrested in a bar in the first one , and here he clearly isn't . So it is kind of a whole different story and could play more like a sequel . The spirits this time are a lot more active and the family is a lot more unpleasant . I didn't think the older brother and sister were related at first because they seemed to have a thing for each other at the beginning . The two younger siblings seemed bizarre to . The husband was abusive and the mother a total pain . You could care less about any of these people . In fact watching them argue is a bit awkward . Then something happens that you knew was going to happen , but the movie isn't nearly over yet . It turns from a haunted house movie to " The Exorcist " . I kept thinking " shouldn't this be over now ? " The rest of this one revolves around a priest trying to save the oldest son of the family that moved in . For some reason the Catholic Church in these movies never wants to help which makes no sense . If you can document these events couldn't they pretty much prove the existence of God and Satan ? Church enrollment and attendance would soar . This one has some good gore scenes here and there especially at the end when the boys face falls apart , but all in all this one wasn't very good .
Another one I got dragged to .	My friend is for some reason a big Disney fan . . . he sees all the movies and somehow he always finds a gal that is really into Disney too . From time to time , he somehow drags me to one of these Disney movies . I have a policy of I will go to any movie as long as someone pays my way . So I got dragged to this one and man , I didn't find it all that enjoyable . If it wasn't for the character Eddie Murphy voiced I would have had a completely lousy time indeed . His character though does do some funny things so I was able to tolerate it better . This one has a girl pretending to be a guy in order to help her father who is drafted to serve , but is very old . Of course , in this type of movie the girl does great in the army and becomes a better soldier than all the guys as is typical with these kinds of movies . In the end I was able to sit through this one , but I wouldn't want to see it again . I have never really been a big fan of Disney movies , even when I was a kid so maybe I should revise my you pay I'll go policy .
Sadly the highlight of this flick was the girls in their lingerie .	Quite frankly , the only highlight is only going to appeal to guys and even this does not save the longest 97 minute movie in the history of movies . I mean I swear the running time seemed about an hour longer than it says it was . Well I should talk about the plot a bit so here goes . It starts out as a very uneven movie as they show you flashbacks here and now this and that and the other . I mean it was a rather hard movie to follow at first , but hey after awhile this stops and you are left wishing the movie would return to that format because at least it is distracting . Five girls are brought into a haunted hospital to spend five hours . . . it is meant as nothing more than a stunt , but then people are killed . . . I think . I wasn't to sure thanks to all the flashing back and forward going on . Well eventually it becomes clear there is something going on and it isn't pretty . However , our five girls are and seeing them run around the place in their undergarments proves to be a nice distraction for a minute or two . However , this becomes a really tedious movie really fast with really stupid revelations also in flashback and in black and white pictures . It does have one rather good death scene , but for the most part I nearly slipped into a coma and I just wanted it to end . The film is also badly shot , I mean it looks like some generic show from mtv or something and the outside shots of the hospital don't really inspire fear , but rather the question " why the hell are they using day for night on the exterior of a building ? " I mean day for night is a nifty device , but a couple of flashlights or something on the building at night would look better than what we had here . This occurred on the inside to , as it was clearly daytime throughout the entire movie . Then we come to the end when the " deathtunnel " is revealed , yes the 500 feet of pure terror that was promised us on the back of the DVD . Well let me just say , you will be disappointed as less happens here than in the rest of the movie and not a lot happens in the rest of the movie ! ! ! Finally , we have an uber stupid ending to go along with our stupid film and the credits roll and clearly the film makers know what the only thing worth watching was as they show us our girls in their lingerie dancing at a party as the credits roll .
This one really wasn't very funny .	Aside from a few good jokes here and there this one was rather dull . No wonder it won an award for most boring comedy of the year in 1995 . I chuckled a couple of times , but for the most part I just wanted it to be over . Mel Brooks was most definitely not at his best for this one as at times you forget it is supposed to be a comedy and it takes it self to seriously .
Not as good as it should have been .	Seems the more monsters they feature in a Godzilla movie the less time the monsters are actually on screen . This one once again has aliens trying to take over earth with monsters . . . a whole lot of monsters . Some we have seen before ( Godzilla being one of the main ones ) and a few we haven't ( some weird snake looking thing ) . All in all though this movie bogs down more than once as it seems it would rather focus on the people rather than the monsters . In one scene we are treated to these guys using some laser beam to cut something and the scene goes on and on . They show what the laser is cutting , they show the device , then they show the guy cutting and this goes on for a good bit . At the end though there is an all out monster attack as we regain control of the monsters , but it isn't much fun as it has poor King Gidorah squaring off against way to many monsters , they really should have given him an ally to help him . . . unfortunately , Gigan and MechaGodzilla had not come into being yet .
Not my favorite but . . .	If not for this one Godzilla would have never been reborn into the more destructive Godzilla , who doesn't do cute little dances when he defeats an enemy . Yes , this one was mainly made to reinvent Godzilla as one bad destructive monster rather than the one that helped man for no apparent reason . This one awakens and of course proceeds to destroy Tokyo . For some reason they felt the need to splice in Raymond Burr footage that is not part of the Japanese cut and adds nothing to the flick . The reason I don't like this one is that I have always preferred to see Godzilla fight something , anything rather than just toy tanks and stuff . Of course , everything that gets thrown at him is tossed aside like the toys they are and the Japanese have to devise another more tricky way to kill him . To bad he isn't like the American version . . . they could take that one out with a pistol .
Typical of the movie games for the Sega Cd .	Nothing special , it like all sega cd games has flaws galore . This one is basically the very limited control of the situation you have in this game . Of course , that is basically a problem with all the games that incorporate movies into their game . This one has you flying around a bunch of pipes exterminating creatures that are infesting these tunnels . You have a copilot that constantly gives you advice , cuts you down , are says what a good job you are doing . Your boss also does about the same thing . He also goes berserk near the end of the game and sets super monsters on your tail for some reason or another . So be prepared to fly around basically on autopilot except for the occasional turn where you pick the right way or crash in a dead end . For the most part you are aiming a target though at the various monsters in the sewers and the higher your score the more impressed your copilot and your obnoxious boss are . If you really suck and score really low not only will they not be impressed the game will end . I was rather good at this one as all you really had to do was memorize where the monsters are as they are in the same place all the time .
It had potential .	Along with potential it also had some good death scenes . Unfortunately , it was to like the typical 90's horror movie to be anything special . One of the things that bugs me about this movie are all the references to Fulcio and other earlier horror movies like that is what they were trying to make . I am wondering have they ever actually watched any of these movies . All the cast are the typical 90's cast , while in Fulcio's and other earlier flicks generally use more mature if not more established actors . It also takes awhile before the killings start . They reference " the Beyond " in this movie , but in that flick there were deaths throughout while this one is a bit bottom heavy . And there are other examples of this throughout the flick . Other problems , to much comedy . . . I am sick of seeing comedy in frikin horror movies . It worked in some ( return of the living dead ) , but most of the time all it does is take away from the flick . And please , don't make a zombie be intelligent and talk , they're not supposed to .
Novel at first , but it got a bit stale .	This game has you as a main character going to a new town and setting up a home . You get to meet your various animal neighbors and do a few things such as fishing or bug collecting . You progress in real time so whatever day it is on your gamecube it is that time in animal crossing . For awhile this is somewhat fun , however , over time the game seemed more like a chore than a fun game to play . If I decorated my house wrong I was blasted , the animals kept expecting you to visit . What really got on my nerves is that at first new animals would move in and that was neat and then some would move away , but after awhile the only ones that would move out was the newest one that just came . I would have liked it to be more random . Also , the fishing and stuff got old and I would have liked a few more things to do . They had special days when there would be festivals in town and I thought maybe you could do some new things then , but all you can do is watch the other animals do stuff while you just do your stuff as normal . Also , I am a night person and I would have liked to see at least one habitant of the town not be in bed after a certain time leaving me to wander the town alone . Still , I am betting if you had a friend who had a town and you could visit this game would have been more fun . All in all it has its moments , but for me it wore thin , however it did have me hooked for a bit . So I will not say avoid it , I just think it is a case of it not being for me .
The fact that this movie was originally supposed to be another Creepshow sequel helps me understand .	Understand what you ask ? Why this movie to me just does not have the feel of the television series it is named from and does seem to have more of a Creepshow feel to it . None of the three stories seems like it would ever have played on the television show with the introduction story of the little boy being held by the crazy woman probably being the most like it came from the show . The first story seems straight out of the HBO series " Tales from the Crypt " with the second one having more of the " Creepshow feel and the final one almost having more of a Twilight Zone quality to it . The first story has one guy killing people with the help of a mummy , not really much to it , but it does have the most stars in it as you will recognize quite a few of the people featured in it . The second one is my favorite , but not really going to garner to much mention as a hit-man is requested by a rather eccentric old man to exterminate a rather strange target . The target in question is that of a cat . The final story is about a man who witnesses a strange killing and is told to keep it a secret , his life seems to be going well , but he is still haunted by what he saw that evening . This story is really to tame with the exception of the beginning and the end . Then of course the story of the boy and his captor is wrapped up . It has a few ups and is far from awful , it just is not that good either as the show had much better stories .
Another could have been really good horror movie .	This one started out promising , but it never really delivered on that promise . This movie has a group of seven tourists going to a castle . Each of them is supposed to represent one of the seven deadly sins . Unfortunately , I don't know them all so all I know for sure is that the fat guy was gluttony , the one older lady was greed . I don't know the others at all . I think lust is one , but that seemed to be everyone else's sin except the old man who was just a complainer . Not sure what he represented . This movie suffers from not much happening and then in a 10 or 15-minute stretch all the killings take place . Then it ends and let me tell you the ending is very weak to say the least . Then there is the lesbian scene . It is rather out of place here , but I am not complaining . . . it spices things up a bit . It is also very long too . All in all this one isn't the best movie , but it has its moments .
Well it does feature a pit and the dead so the title is accurate .	This is not going to be a surprise , but here we have yet another horror movie that had potential , but in the end just cannot deliver all the goods . It has a semi decent story , but there are to many plot holes and unanswered questions . There are zombies in the movie , however , for the most part they are confined to the end . The movie also feels longer than its hour and a half runtime . I mean I just watched the movie " Inferno " and according to its runtime it is over ten minutes longer , but it felt a lot shorter . To the story , it starts out with a confrontation between two doctors at the dead pit of the title . One of the doctors is a tad insane and seemingly doing random experiments with the patients at this insane asylum . Well the one doctor shoots this doctor and instead of reporting the happenings to the authorities he seals the now dead crazy doctor in the basement of this building and you are thinking " why didn't he go to the police " ? Because if he did there would not be much of a movie now would there silly . Flash years later and the place is running again and a new patient who is calling herself Jane Doe because of memory loss seems to spark a return of our good doctor from the basement . He is soon out beginning his experiments again with his sights set on revenge of the man who killed him . So that is how the movie progresses , for a bit there I was worried there would not be much time for the zombie attack at the end and that it would be just a small pointless scene , however , I just think the rest of the movie dragged to much because the zombie scene at the end is a bit good . On the whole if this movie was just paced better and they got to the zombies quicker it would have been better , but as it is it is a not all that bad , not all that good movie .
Great premise , but in the end it disappoints .	The story , a demon takes the form of Freddy Krueger and starts haunting the dreams of the actual cast of the Elm Street series . This Freddy doesn't joke around and looks far more threatening than in the previous installments . Everything about this movie should have been cool , but I just found it to be disappointing . It definitely has its moments though ; it is just too bad that for the most part it is rather slow . At one point in the movie I began to wonder if Freddy was even in the movie , and there are not a lot of deaths in this one either . All in all it is not the worst movie you will ever see and it has some good scenes , but in the end it just needed more .
Follows the basic structure of a haunted house movie .	Basically this movie is like a more gruesome haunted house tale than the original Amityville or a less gruesome haunted house tale than the Amityville remake . However , the movie most certainly follows the flow of those two movies . I would have actually given this movie a six , but they kept trying to make out like this story was pure fact and that rather ticked me off , I mean what do they take me for a moron . I know a bit about the story it is taken from and there are so many differences it is pathetic . I realize that you have to add some stuff or the movie is going to be kind of boring , heck I am even for embellishing the story to the degree this one did , but do not have the this serious voice over telling me how this is true and have the writing at the end tell an out right lie . So what is the story you ask ? Well a teenage boy has cancer and his mother is having to drive him a great distance quite often for a special treatment . Mother decides to find a place to rent closer to the place the son gets treatments so he does not have to endure the long drive in pain and vomiting . Of course , the family's financial situation is not to good so when the house with the history comes up for rent you know our family is going to make that their new stomping ground . So spooky reflections and such start to take place as well as strange visions and we even have a reverend enter the picture to give our youth guidance . So yes , the typical haunted house formula is here . Add in a pointless stretch of film where the father drinks and you have your movie , though I am betting that part of the film is actually true , but they changed so much around why not just omit that part all together as it really did not bring anything to the film . So I say add some more scares , perhaps a little gore , do not try to pass off the movie as being a reenactment or something and this film might have been really good . . . just like a lot of horror movies it is usually might have is it not ?
Starts promisingly ends weakly .	I can see how people like this movie , but it just did not work for me . Granted I saw it on the Sci-fi channel so maybe all the commercial breaks had a hand to play in how I feel about this movie . I thought it started out with a bang , person in a strange room checks out his surrounds goes into another room and instantly gets shredded . Suffice to say I was compelled to watch after that . Then a group of strangers gets together in one of the rooms and begin to work together to find a way out and to figure out just what this strange labyrinth is designed by or who made it . It is good for about the first thirty to forty minutes as we see a variety of traps take out a member and other traps our crew must avoid . At the end though there is just to much in fighting for my tastes as one of the party gets a tad to paranoid . So the rest of the movie the traps are virtually ignored and we are left with people who have the key to getting out spending all their time literally trying to kill each other . So there ya , the paranoia and such takes center stage and the cool traps which caught my attention in the first place are gone . Still I can see how you need something else to bring to the table as you need more plot than just trap room , death , and this and that . . . I think this would have been better served as a forty five minute short rather than full length movie . However , as a lot of people out there seem to like this movie I say give it a shot .
Bizarre film .	I caught this movie a while back , but I still remember it a bit . This one is kind of like the science fiction horror movie " Horror Planet " only this time it happens on earth . This one has a woman impregnated by something or another . Her baby has a special thirst for blood so the mother must kill in order to feed her baby , so you can tell the title for this one is quite accurate . This is nothing new as I have already mentioned a movie where this was done before , what makes this one freaky is that the baby actually communicates with the mother . It tells her what he is and what his intentions are . Quite frankly , there is nothing for the world to worry about . This one is okay in places , but it does move a bit slow at times as well . It is worth a look see , but I wouldn't buy it or anything . It is a bit interesting to see how the mother reacts to the baby as sometimes she loathes it and at other times she loves it . In the end it primarily shifts to a more basic horror movie .
This one was pretty good .	I usually like an Arnold flick and this one was pretty good . It amazes me how the last movie he made that made 100 million was the god awful Batman and Robin . . . meanwhile the three flicks he has put out since then are all better movies and didn't even get close ( I didn't see the 6th day but people say it is pretty good too ) . In this one he plays a fire fighter whose family is killed in a terrorist attack and he goes searching for said terrorist . Some twists along the way make this an interesting movie as well . Could have been better , but what the heck I enjoyed it . I really hope Terminator 3 is good enough to bring Arnold another super hit .
DREAM WARRIORS . . . DON'T WANT TO SLEEP NO MORE . . .	Yes , this was the first " Nightmare on Elm St " to have its own theme song if you do not count the one two Freddy's coming for you one . This was also the start of a trend of Freddy becoming more of a comedian rather than a really creepy and spooky killer . Despite that though , I still like it quite a bit . He still maintains a bit of spookiness here and his kills are still rather good before they would become kind of goofy in the next installment ( the roach motel ) . Here a bunch of kids are in a ward because they believe Freddy is coming for them and for that reason they are really quite sleep deprived . The girl from the first one returns too try and help them as she is one of the few who knows Freddy really exists and by golly he is going to kill them . She and the kids plan . . . learn to manipulate the dreams and fight Freddy at his own game . One guy turns into a wizard in the dream world , another gets super strong , and one gal turns into a punk rock girl . Of course , no of these powers are really all that helpful and in the end it takes some guys out of the dream world to stop Freddy , or is he stopped . Laurence Fisburne of " The Matrix " is apparently in this , but I don't remember him unless he was the strong guy , but I don't think he was . Also , I always wondered if the guy who wouldn't talk was supposed to be the guy from part two . Not a bad movie , but it was really kind of the beginning of the end .
Followed the first one too much .	This sequel to the successful movie Ghostbusters was itself , pretty successful . In the end though it did not do as well and just seemed a little flat . The story of the slime was pretty good and it was funny seeing them do kid's birthday parties ( though I doubt a kid at that time would have watched He-man cartoons ) . In the end this movie suffers from the fact that it follows the basic structure of the first movie so there is nothing really different about it . You have them investigating something , you have them dispatching a ghost , then you have the musical interval , then you have them locked up ( in a loony bin this time ) , then you have a building taken over by the head ghost , and finally you have a giant thing walking through New York . It just seems to me that with ghosts and other things , you could come up with a totally original and funny script without having to follow what worked in the previous chapter . It is a shame too , that another Ghostbusters will probably never be made . It would be interesting to see it , considering all the advancements in special effects .
Super in a lot of ways , not all of them good .	Wow , I was one of the first to see Superman Returns at a special ten o'clock show . . . the crowd was rowdy and ready , and so was I . It was rather confusing to follow at the beginning , I wasn't sure of the time frame , however , it all started playing out . Superman had been gone five years , I am thinking it continues off from part two , however , I can't be totally sure of that . There are many changes when Superman returns , including Louis with a kid and new guy , however , he gets his old job back at the Daily Planet as Clark . . . he soon must release Superman back into the world , however , as he must make a daring and very cool plane rescue . What to say about the movie ? The guy doing Superman is okay just as Reeves was , once again they could have gotten someone better , but then again they also could have gotten someone worse ( Cage would have been worse ) . The movie is super familiar too , and it isn't really all that exciting after the plane rescue which I thought was the highlight of the film . Lex Luther's plan in this one is eerily similar to his plot from the first movie only on a more grand scheme . Same sort of Kryptonite scene , same female sidekick for Lex , the music sounds exactly the same there is just a bit to much that seems recycled from the first Superman movie for me here . I know some will call it a tribute , but I say it is just some lazy writing . The ending is also super long , to long , I just wanted it to end at one point as you knew basically what was going to happen . . . also most of the action consisted of Superman catching stuff or the ending action scene of throwing something . Let me just say Superman's strength was a bit inconsistent as he labored with smaller objects in earlier scenes . Holes and bad writing in the storyline were aplenty and there were many cutable scenes . Still the effects were great , Spacey as Lex Luthor was great and it had some very good moments . . . that plane scene was very memorable . . . So if you are a Superman fan go see it you will probably enjoy it a lot more than me , I thought it was just okay , nothing super though .
A more dark , dark waters movie .	First , I have to say this is at least a more enjoyable film than the 2005 American " Dark Waters " because at least we have something going on . Still not as good as I was hoping in that the movie was flawed in some places . The picture quality was terrible , I don't know if this was done intentionally to make it look older , or maybe the DVD I bought was just a really bad transfer , but this movie looks like it was released in the 70's or something . I know many older movies that look more recent than this and I am not talking big budget ones either . Just watch Fulci's " The Beyond " and it looks a lot newer . Another problem , the movie is a bit to predictable . Not that this is supposed to be a movie with a shocker ending or something , but they should not telegraph the plot revelations to the point where they reveal nothing . Finally , why was this movie called " Dark Waters " and " Dead Waters " ? All through the movie I was expecting some sort of dark ancient demon arising from the water off the coast of the island they were on , but to no avail . . . this scene just never happens . The only water scene has a priest at the beginning of the movie being killed in the water and this death is never really touched on throughout the rest of the flick . Also , another annoying scene is when the one girl talks to the old blind woman who may or may not be revealing important plot points , but her accent is so thick you can not understand her . Still for the most part it was an okay movie , the music was done rather good and is creepy . The dream sequences are great and there are some good deaths here and there and there is good atmosphere for a horror movie . The plot is also kind of interesting , I just wish for an ending scene with a really evil looking monster coming out of the depths of the sea rather than what we get .
Not on par with " Jaws " , still an okay monster movie .	I know I will be lambasted by those who love this movie and those who hate it for saying it was just okay to me , but that is how it is at IMDb . The movie sort of worked , but then it didn't . A movie where there is a mysterious creature hanging on a bridge , that promptly turns to chaos as said monster attacks . A little girl is taken by the beastie , people are quarantined , and the family of the little girl convinced she is still alive escape the hospital and try to find her . The first bit of this film was great , and I thought the hype on the film would be justified . However , after awhile the focus of the movie shifts a bit much here and there , and the plot has some problems as well . I did not care much for the ending either , however it was a surprise so in a way it was an effective ending . The monster was rather good looking in some scenes , not all that great in others , always a step ahead of a Sci-Fi channel monster movie . The strange shifts in the tone of the movie kind of had me confused at times because we went from horror to comedy to drama and here and there and back again . This did keep the movie interesting , as did the virus plot , that also detracted from the movie in that it almost was pointless in a way . Like I said this movie probably suffers from going in way to many directions and it never feels like a complete movie , however it still entertained me enough that it was an okay movie and I would recommend it to others as there are many people who really consider it an excellent flick . . . just a matter of taste .
Of the Silent Hill games I have played . . . for me the weakest .	The only ones though I have not played are part one and the sixth one which has yet to be released at the time of this review . Still , it was for me an okay game , with a rather interesting story to it . I have heard though that this was initially not even going to be a Silent Hill game , but I find this hard to believe . If this is the case I am guessing it was decided it would be a Silent Hill game rather early in the development process . The game screams Silent Hill to often to be a switch mid-game development . The story starts off very promisingly as our hero is seemingly trapped in his own apartment room . You explore it first person , then discover a hole big enough for you to crawl through and before you lies the more traditional Silent Hill format type areas . You start off in a subway , then you are out in a forest area , next comes a prison , a building area , inside an apartment and finally a hospital . You meet different people in each of the areas and go to your apartment in between and learn things about your tenants and you receive diary entries from the former tenant of your department telling you about a serial killer named Walter Sullivan who was thought to have killed himself yet you witness murders that have his signature all over it . Killing people and carving numbers on their back . Sounds good , so why is it the weakest of the series you ask ? Well the fighting is a bit to tough even on easy . The regular enemies are not to bad , but they have these ghosts that are a real pain to kill . The areas are also a bit of a pain to traverse . You also have to go through every area except the hospital twice so it kind of gets stale near the end . The subway world is a bit tough both times , the forest world was only tough the second time around . The prison was a total pain the first time around , and the building world was easy both times . The apartment was also tough only the first time around and the hospital , which you only went through once was not to bad . The second time around though has one constant annoyance and that is your next door neighbor Eileen dragging slowly along behind you . As for the combat , standard Silent Hill . Basically , two and three type and not much improved fighting of Origins . So a game with a pretty good story that is a bit difficult for me and it repeats itself a bit to much too .
Grand scale movie . . . though a bit dull in many places .	This movie had to have had a huge budget behind it for the times . It plays like a big budget movie , but I feel there are quite a number of flaws as well . The number one being Christopher Reeve . I just don't think he was all that great in any of the movies . I am not saying he was awful , he just wasn't all that great . Another problem is the beginning . So much time is spent on Krypton and in Smallville that it just doesn't leave much room for Metropolis . In fact once he becomes Superman the movie seems to turn on the afterburners shoving plot points down our throat so fast you wonder just when Clark / Superman fell in love with Louise . Those who made the movie seemed also to want us to show that superman can fly that a great number of his other powers are completly ignored for the most part . Just how did Louise know Superman even had x-ray vision . Once again to much time was spent showing his early life so now they had to go full steam ahead ignoring to much . Spider-man also showed Parker before his powers and while he was learning what they could to , but they also developed the plot for the whole movie . This movie was like three different movies . So much so that Lex Luther isn't even in it till the last half and his evil plot doesn't seem like it is developed very well . Then there is the scene where Louise is flying around with Superman and these scenes will make you cringe . It sounds like I hated this movie , but I am just pointing out stuff I perceived as flaws . . . all in all it is an ok movie .
Why so stingy with the ammo ?	This is the first of the Resident Evil games ( or Biohazard games ) , and from the ones I have played it is my least favorite . It does not have the cool flow of part two , the tension of part three , or the fact you can aim your gun of part four . However , this is the first game , with movie sequels they tend to get worse , with video games they tend to get better . We start out in this one with an awful movie featuring real actors ( I use the term actors loosely ) investigating an area and running to a house in the most ridiculous fashion . This is thankfully the last of these type of scenes . The rest of the game features one of two characters going through said house in search of clues . They must face zombies , mutant dogs , and a lot of this and that . You don't get much ammo and this hurts the director's cut of this game as it becomes extremely hard at the point the jumping creatures that take off your head with one whack are introduced . I had to start over and just play the easy level I got so annoyed . The game play doesn't help as you walk slowly , and it is hard to shoot . The story is really the only thing that saves this one .
I found this one to be the weakest of the series .	I found this " Leathal Weapon " to be just an okay movie with some good action here and there and some good comedy here and there . It has problems though as it plays out more like an episode of a television show rather than a movie , there is not a very good bad guy in this one , and the whole Roger killing young kid scenes really bring the movie down . It also introduces yet another character in the super bad female who is just as tough as the guys and I have never liked those types . They clutter many movies these days and I don't mind them in some movies , but I just don't think she fits in this series as we already have our resident butt kicker in Riggs . The plot featuring cop killer bullets is a bit uninspired as well . Still there are the good points , very funny scenes of Roger and Riggs having to be uniformed police officers and Joe Pesci's character is great too . There is always good action in a " Leathal Weapon " movie as well and this one is no exception there either . Just needed more here in the form of better villains , and less here in areas of plot that just seemed unnecessary to the story or brought the movie down .
Started out interestingly enough , but the ending was just to bizarre .	I saw this movie on television a while back and only watched a bit of it because I had something to do . Suffice to say I found it very interesting as Depp's character was appraising these books and then went on to have an interesting conversation with another character interested in a book known as the " Ninth Gate " . Well I found this movie cheap years later so I bought it and it played out somewhat good , as all the book research was actually pretty interesting . Also , there was possible conspiracy afoot . A few twists and turns here and there as Depp's character does not know who to trust , as he is set on a mission to compare three books with each other , those who own the other books are being snuffed out . Then near the end it just got to weird as Depp's character seemed to do some stuff that did not seem to be his motivation for the majority of the flick . He seemed to develop an interest for what the book did on the spur of the moment and it kind of made the movie crash when there were some strange happenings . Still , it was enjoyable enough for what it was , just needed a better ending possibly more realistic . For the most part though this movie is sort of like the satanic version of Da Vinci Code . . . however , it still has some humorous moments as well and strange bits of music that makes it seem like it is a comedy .
Kind of predictable .	Trust me . . . you will know who the monster is well before it is over . The only reason to watch this one is to see Lee and Cushing in the same movie . Though this time Lee is a good guy and Cushing could be considered to be bad . The movie is basically about a creature turning people into stone in a small town . . . A guy comes after the death of some relative to investigate , after awhile Lee comes to assist him . The guy sees the reflection of the gorgon in a fountain and it knocks him out and his hair turns white . All this leads up to who the spirit of the Gorgon is possessing which isn't to hard to figure out .
I am surprised that its score is not higher .	Not that I gave it a high score , I gave it a six , just seems more people would have liked it . I thought it was okay , certainly better than the really lame sequel . This one shows us the creation of the beast known as Swamp Thing . Rather bloody for a pg rated movie and it has some rather good monsters in it , but the main problem I had with it is that it took itself too seriously ( while the sequel was too much of a joke ) . The whole atmosphere of the movie is rather depressing and it also has a rather light soundtrack through most of it . On the plus side , here we have a monster movie where we do not have to wait till the very end to see the main attraction , as Swamp Thing is in this one a lot . Louis Jordan is rather good as the villain , and Adrian is good as the love interest . All in all it is okay , but it does move a bit slow in places and there is very little humor in it too . There is , however , one heck of a good fight between Swamp Thing and the villain transformed at the end . Worth a look , as I said it is rather bloody and violent for a pg rated movie .
The fighting and the ending bring this one down a bit .	The story has a young man taking the mantle of " Devil Summoner " . He wields a sword and gun , but in a pinch what sets him apart is his ability to summon demons to fight along side him or help him solve mysteries . He works at a detective agency and one day a girl with a bizarre request calls them to a bridge where the ultimate challenge awaits our hero . The story is rather good , and for the most part the game was okay as you could use demons to read people's minds and do various other things . The combat though was a bit of a pain . Not like the other games of the Shin Megemi Tensei name this one relies real time combat . A combat that at times is hard to pinpoint where exactly the enemy is in relationship to you so you end up swinging at air . You also run into very hard battles near the end and you almost always need a healing demon summoned to help you and you only get one demon on screen at a time . The ending to it was not anything special either . I prefer the fights in the other Shin Megemi games as they took more strategy , to many of the fights here turn into slashing away frantically . Still the setting is great in 1900's Japan , it is sort of like the Shadow Heart games in the way it is set in the real world . The music is okay for the most part , but it does get repetitive . Also , I would have like the characters to actually speak lines rather than just word boxes . Still , thanks to the story it is a all right game .
Stallone does his version of Dirty Harry .	Basically , Stallone is Dirty Harry in this movie . Though this is weaker than any of Clint Eastwood's movies I thought it was an okay action flick . You just can not take it too seriously or over analyze it . I can't believe it is ranked so low here , granted it is not all that original or special , but hey it was not boring either . Cobra ( Stallone's character ) is on the search for a strange serial killer , who turns out to be some cult that believes only the strong should live and be in control . A woman witnesses a murder committed by one of its member and Cobra is assigned to protect her . Not much more to it than that . A lot of action scenes that consists of things you have seen before , but hey if you want to watch a mindless movie than this is the one to see . I like a mindless flick every once in a while , well a lot . . . I just don't want to see stuff that makes you think all the time . Sometimes you just want to turn off your brain and enjoy , and you can do that with this movie .
A bit different than the story it was based on .	Of course , considering it was a rather short story you have to expect the story to change somewhat . The short story was about a cleanup crew who was working an extra day for some extra pay . They find a sub-basement and the main character in it did have a problem with his boss . Though in the story you never find out why . In this extra place all this strange creatures are there and the only weapon the main character and the boss have is a super powered hose . The boss tries to run out and the main character hits him with a stream from the hose , the boss is dead and then the main character gets it . . . the end . A few similarities between the two , but they added actually more depth to the story . There is a reason why everyone hates the boss in this one and there is more to it than just a sub-basement . There is a whole cavern below the foundry where they work . There are no longer a bunch of mutant creatures , rather there is only one strange beast lurking beneath the place . Though they do keep the part about them working an extra day and that is when they find the underground . I thought this one was okay , it could have explained what the caves were better and the guy playing the boss goes over the top later in the movie , but I still enjoyed it a bit . A few surprises here and there , but some of the stuff you know is going to happen way before it does .
Two strong stories , and two rather weak ones .	This movie opens with a rather humorous opening featuring Dan Akroyd and Albert Brooks as it has them discussing various things when they finally come upon the " you want to see something scary " topic of discussion . This is a kind of pre credit introduction to the horrors and wonders of the twilight zone . It then proceeds to a story of a man who is rather racist so he is the first to enter the realm and of course he is put through a lot including being in a rather bad story that was not very twilight like that ended up being part of a tragic Hollywood story as a helicopter accident would take the lead actor Morrow and two child actors . The second story follows a group of elderly people in a nursing home who are about to get a visit from an older man who has a special kind of gift from them . This story was weak too , as it was just a bit to cutesy for my tastes . Finally , the movie gets good as we have the story of a boy with a special secret . He is hit by a woman and she proceeds to take him home to meet his very strange family . This story is good , but it ends rather weakly . Finally , the highlight of this movie a story featuring John Lithgow as a passenger on a plane that is in the middle of a rather violent storm . Add to that he has a dreaded fear of flying and add to that the fact he seems to see a person on the wing of the plane and this person or thing is doing harm to the engines . Add a better ending to story three and just get two different stories all together for the first film and maybe this movie would not have to rely on one story to save the day which the last one does .
Took awhile to really get going good .	One of the first role playing games that I remember playing that had a daytime and nighttime in it , this was an okay game to play . Kind of a final fantasy light . The fact it was night and sometimes day was one of its differences , that and the lead characters ability to turn into a dragon set this one apart a bit . However , at first , the story is very slow going with the only real good story bit coming in the town where zombies attacked at night . The story has an evil dragon empire trying to take over the world and of course your character is the only one who can challenge it . Once you get through a rather drab set of missions the story really kicks off and becomes more fun . Especially , when your character can become a super powered dragon , at this point the game becomes easier . It is a bit hard at first too , which is what really hinders the story as there are a bit to many random encounters . The fights get quicker though near the end as you learn more powerful transformations , in fact the last boss is not a problem if you use the most powerful technique .
Two hot gals battle for survival .	They don't make them like this anymore . Some would say that is good , but me I like this one . A comet goes over earth . . . anyone who directly watches it dies by totally drying up , anyone indoors becomes a lunatic who craves human blood , and anyone lucky enough to be in some sort of metal shelter survives . Two really attractive girls survive ( one is even a cheerleader , hehe ) and they have to fight some of the lunatics to survive . They run into a truck driver also lucky enough to survive in this one too . There is also an institution where there are apparent survivors to the comet , but looks are deceiving as they too are slowly becoming bloodthirsty . Best to turn off your brain for this one cause there are a few flaws . Like how do people in an underground facility get infected just cause they left air vents open , but someone in a metal movie projector hut not get infected cause that hut is not air tight . Like I said just turn off your brain for some mindless fun .
Good film that was missing something .	I enjoyed this film , which is about a cop on the trail of a super killer . Apparently this killer is a monster and Rutger is the only one to have seen it . . . and seeing it makes you eat chocolate and drink lots of coffee . Good humor and action , this movie would have gotten a higher score from me if it ended a bit better . Sure the monster looks pretty good , but all in all the ending was a bit anti-climatic and was kind of a letdown especially considering how good the rest of the film was . I like the fact they had London flooded though , it provided a really good atmosphere to the movie and Hauer did a great job in this as well . . . as he is a very underrated actor who I wish got more parts in big time movies .
Brain slugs from outer space .	The first scene of this movie had me worried a bit because it looked rather stupid . It had this short little alien running through a ship and he sends this thing out of the ship and then it lands on earth in a black and white scene . However , this movie was rather good . . . it has these two guys who end up releasing these creatures and they must find a way to put everything right . How do they release them , for some reason they have to get a dead body from the morgue , instead they get one in some research area who is apparently frozen . In him is a slug like creature that when given the chance will jump to another victim . Sooner or later the head will explode because these things lay eggs in your head . You don't stay dead though as these things make you walk around as zombies . Heck , you can tell this movie has it all . The guy playing the cop is really good as are the two friends who accidentally cause the whole mess . The movie also has some comedy in it as well . . . though I do have a couple of complaints . One , I didn't care for the guy on crutches being killed . . . totally unnecessary and it brought the movie down . Second , I wasn't wild about the end with the dog . Other than that a wild killer slug / zombie movie .
Okay game , but in the end it just increases my desire to see part seven remade on a more powerful system .	Yes , I want to see part seven remade and this one kind of shows you how that might look . Not only would the graphics be improved , but they could add voice overs too . Not that this one was not good , but it was not really all that great game play wise . An action rpg which is fine seeing as how Zack is the only character you control , the main problems stem from the various missions in the game . They total 300 and anyone who completes all of them could probably beat the final bosses blindfolded as I had no trouble with them and I had completed only half . I would have rather have had more game play in the main story . More locations would have been nice too . Also , pieces of this story don't really fit into what was established in part seven of Final Fantasy . One would probably be correct in assuming that none of this was thought of when they were making seven . Still they did an okay job with the story . What is the story , basically this one tells the story of Zack as he makes his way through the ranks of soldier doing various missions . He is tracking a rogue soldier operative named Genesis . Along the way you meet many of the characters from Final Fantasy VII including Seipheroth , Cloud , Tifa , Yuffie and others though the main one for Zack is Aerith . The fighting is a sort of encounter the enemy and then fighting them action rpg style . It is a bit annoying to try and use potions and such in this one , still it is a very fast paced combat . So for a nice little back story of FFVII play this one as it may have a lot of faults it still has a very memorable and sad ending .
Goofy science fiction movie , but that is what they were trying to make .	This movie clearly has a small budget , looks cheap , and isn't very serious . Fortunately , that is exactly what the film makers were going for . I enjoy this one , though it is apparent by its score that most people don't . I just find it funny and I love the cast which includes Ron Pearlman and even Angelica Houston . Heck , John Carradine even has a small role in it , though his scene is absolutely pointless and adds nothing to the flick . In fact it is a rather serious scene especially considering the rest of the movie . This one doesn't look great , kind of like Space Mutiny , but unlike Space Mutiny this one isn't trying to be serious so the effects can be forgiven . This one has a band of space pirates that go after , you guessed it , ice . They do this at the beginning and get immediately captured and this sets up the rest of the movie . No work of art , but it is entertaining to me .
Presenting the movie " Shining in the Corn " set to a civil war backdrop .	By no means do I mean to imply this movie is bad or anything , but it is sort of a combination of two Stephen King movies " The Shining " and " Children of the Corn " set in the civil war times . In fact , I found this movie rather good , a nice atmospheric horror movie that isn't geared to teens as the main cast are all adults . The story , a group of what appears to be confederate soldiers robs another group of confederate soldiers while they are attempting to place it in a bank for safe keeping . . . basically a bank robbery . They flee to a house one of the members of thieves has been told about and plan to wait out an incoming storm and stay the night and head for Mexico in the morning . To bad things don't go as planned as there seems to be something terribly wrong at the house they are staying at . Meanwhile , two of the robbers start plotting to take all the gold for themselves and another is getting rather sick from an infection of a gunshot wound he sustained during the robbery . There also seems to be someone or something else in the house with them as they see footprints of people and of some sort of beast . There is also the occasional chuckle of a sweet child's laughter . . . you know the type that evil kid laugh that just makes your skin crawl . Well before you know it our group begins to get killed by something and some of them begin to receive visions of terrible things that have happened at the house . Like I said it plays out rather well , I could have used a bit more scares and gore , but I won't complain to much . As for the title of the movie not being really descriptive of said movie it is not . There is really only one dead bird that sticks out and it really has nothing to do with the plot . Really only showing that the land the robbers have now walked on is a place of death . Then again if the title description did fit the movie would be about zombie birds on the attack and that would not be very good . . . well it might be a little fun to watch , but most likely it would be a rather bad movie .
Slow starting , but this werewolf picture finishes with a bang .	This classic werewolf movie is not as good as " An American Werewolf in London " , however it is a pretty good horror movie in its own right . It is also one of the first ( if not the first ) to do an on screen transformation scene not using the old frame by frame technique . The story has a female reporter traumatized after she helps the police track down a serial killer . A friend psychiatrist sends her to a retreat known as " the colony " to help her unwind and get to the root of her problem . Well lets just say her first impulse was right as she really seems to think her and her husband are out of place in this retreat . I would agree , I do believe I would have left after seeing the first little beach party where the guy about to throw himself in the fire seemed the most sane . For the most part this movie has a bit of a slow setup , but once it gets going near the last 20 or thirty minutes it really gets going . The werewolves look rather good , there are a couple of scenes where they appear to be nothing more than cartoons or something , but for the most part they look like working models . There is a bit at the end which puzzles me as it seems to add humor into what was otherwise a movie that wasn't trying to garner laughs . However , for the most part you get a rather nice horror movie with lots of stars , something of a rarity this day and age .
Creepy , but kind of vague .	This movie is different in that it plays out backwards . We start at chapter ten and work our way to a prologue . As you watch it , you begin to see how all the people are interconnected . However , I wasn't really impressed with chapter one or the prologue . This movie seems to be racing towards some sort of dark secret , I could not wait to find out what it was , but in the end it never really revealed anything . I am still not sure what the urban myth was , it was a bit vague , and I never understood why the wife at the end did what she did . I am also unclear where the wife and her daughter were killed . Still though it was creepy enough to overcome this flaws . If you watch this movie , however , keep in mind it is very low budget . The effects are not going to awe you and the film is not very high quality . Still worthy of a look see if you like Japanese horror .
A little bit of Grudge with a twist at the end .	I mainly say it is sort of like Grudge is the hotel setting , or rather the haunted house scenario . This is the first of the after dark horror movies I have seen , and it was okay . Certainly better than other Japanese horror movies , but then it was not super special either . This one starts out with random people encountering ghosts and switches focus on a movie being made about a mass slaying at a hotel . The director is casting the part and selects one girl who just seems to strike him as different . We also get introduced to a student who has reoccurring dreams of said hotel . Her scenes seem to make little sense until the end where everything comes together rather nicely . You should figure out what is about to occur a bit before it happens though as it is telegraphed . Still you get your creepy ghost encounters , your somewhat interesting back story , and a bit of blood thrown in for good measure . I was not entirely happy with the ending , however I did like the way the movie progressed . I was a tad confused with the introduction of the student , however , another movie Kairo was worse with switching scenarios as this one was much easier to roll with than that one . After the revelation at the end though I thought it could have wrapped up quicker , but the look on the girl's face as she was totally freaking out was priceless . A tad creepy and interesting , nothing totally new , but it works .
Has its moments , but like most Farrelly brother movies it has a lot boring scenes .	For my money , Dumb and Dumber was the best Farrelly brother movie . It was nonstop comedy all they way through and they maintained it with almost no scenes that didn't have any comedy . This movie has some really funny scenes , but it also has a lot of pointless scenes where no joke was made or if it was it fell flat . Carrey is great , but he is always good in comedy . Rene is okay as his love interest , but for the most part she isn't very funny . This is the story of a guy who suppresses his anger after his wife leaves him for another man . She also leaves him the kids who are obviously the children of the other man . His anger reaches an explosive level and finally comes out in the funniest scenes of the movie . After that he has to escort Irene ( Rene ) , and there are people after them . The jokes after the great coming out scene are hit and miss for the most part . Some of the jokes are great , others not so good . This movie is also a bit to long , another Farrelly brother flaw and this movie really runs ten or fifteen more minutes than it should have . For the most part though it is a rather good comedy to watch .
The first and definately not the best .	Not to say it is not a good movie , but I find this to be one of the weakest installments to the series . However , it is a rather good film that starts out great , but the ending isn't as good as the rest of the film . This film also has a villian that doesn't seem to have a very good plan . What I mean the viewer is not really sure what the heck Dr . No is trying to accomplish till near the end of the movie and then it is nothing really that special . As I have said it starts out great with a murder on some nice island I forget which , and Bond is sent to uncover the truth of this man's death . There are some chases and all that great spy stuff , and Bond first meets Felix . Then Bond goes to Dr . No's island where he meets the gorgeous Honey Ryder and they must avoid Dr . No's henchmen . Then with the appearance of the " dragon " the movie gets a bit weak for me after Bond and Honey are captured . The finale just isn't that great , but it isn't boring either . Not the best film , but still enjoyable .
From the way it starts it looked like it would be the goriest movie ever .	This movie starts off with a bang . A ship without a crew ends up in New York City . It has these mysterious pulsating eggs aboard . The eggs explode and anything the stuff inside the eggs touches explodes as well . This movie is a take on the movie " Alien " , though this one is set on earth . Like I said this one starts out with numerous deaths , but it tails off in the middle , sort of picks up in the end , but it never matches the gore level it had in the first half hour or so . Ian is good in this one as an ex-astronaut , but the rest of the cast could have been replaced . They needed a better female lead , as the one they had was too old . I listened to an interview with the director of this film and he wanted someone younger , but the producer thought they needed someone older and less attractive . He won and we have lines that were definitely made for a younger woman still left in lines like , " you are one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen " . All in all an enjoyable sci-fi flick , but it could have been a lot better if the energy of the beginning could have been used throughout .
This one was hastily put together .	You can tell this Bond movie was put together fast probably in response to the Star Wars craze . I don't think it was ever intended to be made in that at the end of " The Spy Who Loved Me " it says Bond will return in " For Your Eyes Only " not " Moonraker " . It kind of follows the same blueprint as Spy , and for the most part it works . It is a rather good Bond flick even if it isn't really anything new as once again it is an investigation into why a space shuttle is hijacked . Once again an eccentric millionare seems behind it and Jaws returns as well . Where this movie gets to goofy is when they go into outer space and the battle in the space station . Up to that point this Bond can hold its own against any of the Bond movies as far as action goes .
More of a plot this time .	This one has more of a plot than the first one , but I still like the first one a bit more . This time the Clint Eastwood character gets reunited with Sandra Locke . Why he takes her back and so quickly is anyone's guess . A mafia type group wants to set up a fight between Eastwood's character and this real tough guy . He accepts , but later declines when they learn that the guy he is going to fight once killed a guy . The mafia people don't like the fact he backs out and tries other ways to persuade him to fight . The biker gang returns as do many of the main characters . In the end , the fight takes to place , but man is it long . To long in fact , the ending fight just drags a bit too much . All in all though it is a pretty funny movie , but there is just something about the first I still like more .
You are not supposed to like the super smart kids , but these guys are rather cool .	This is a funny comedy movie from the 80's that just works thanks mainly to the spot on cast . Granted , Val Kilmer kind of steals the show . The movie has a simple enough plot to begin with and through the course of the movie gets bigger and bigger till it " pops " . A very intelligent kid is coming on board at a school for very smart guys , can not remember if it is a college or just an advanced high school . He is a bit out of place , however , he is going to get to meet this legend . Unfortunately , this legend is not at all what he expects clowning around and such and being a rather fun guy . Granted he has a very good reason for this later in the movie . The movie has great scenes where the smart kids make it so dry ice is formed in the halls of the dorm and at one point they have a pool party . They are all in the end working on this laser project which is the central plot point in the film and what makes the plot go from just your typical school type movie to something a bit more . It ends on a very funny note and great ending scene too . So all in all a funny movie with likable characters , I prefer this " nerds " to the ones in " Revenge of the Nerds " . Also , the first time I heard the very good Tears for Fears song " Everybody wants to rule the World " .
Watch as a warrior battles all sorts of monsters on his journey to the floating castle .	This game was a rather cool game for the original Nintendo video game system . It had a mix of play as you had your side scrolling levels and your overhead ones as well . There were role playing game elements as well as the more your character fought the stronger he got as he basically leveled up . It had a touch of Zelda too , as our hero had to collect words of wisdom from these big foreheaded old guys and items to help him progress through the game from even bigger foreheaded old guys . He took out boss villains as well . The weapon you used was a discus weapon that is best described as sort of like Simon Belmont's whip from the Castlevania series . It was basically a shield with spikes on a chain that hit the enemy then came back to the hero . The game took some time to win , which makes it all the more surprising that you had to win it in one sitting as if you turned off the Nintendo you had to start over from the beginning . You got potions in this one , as well as weapon power ups . The bosses were not all that challenging once you really leveled up though the final boss was somewhat challenging . Granted I just made a mad dash to him and hit the button repeatedly till he died . All in all a good game for its day .
Good . . . but my least favorite Bronson Bond movie .	I enjoy this movie like I said , but of Bronson's Bond flicks this is my least favorite . There are reasons for this of course . . . I don't care for Terri Hatcher at all and I am not that wild about Michelle Yeaoh either . The pointless plot point of Bond already having a relationship with Bond was just painful to watch cause Hatcher isn't the best actress in the world . . . she's good on tv , but not movies . Michelle's problem is she just seems to be trying to upstage Bond . Sorry but no one is supposed to be better than Bond . The little Jackie Chan fight scene she had was stupid too . I got the point she knew kung fu from previous scenes . . . her prolonged fight scene was not needed . Other than that this movie has good action . As one commenter said though some more spying could have been in order .
Not fantastic , but a pretty good movie nonetheless .	This movie was rather good and it was a bit light and not as serious as say " Batman Begins " . Hey these are the Fantastic Four though and not the Dark Knight , their name suggests they are going to be a bit less serious . Could have been more action , but it had its comic moments that made up for the lack of action . All the Fantastic Four actors were great so now it is time for my number one major gripe of the film . Doctor Doom was portrayed completely wrong , I did not let it ruin the film for me , but I really did not think the actor was right and I also don't think it would have been all that hard to get his origin correct . He never had any powers in the comic book , he was simply a brilliant scientist and dabbler in magic who blamed Reed for an accident that left him permanently scarred . He created a powerful armor to combat the Fantastic Four and is one of the best Marvel villains there is even fighting the likes of Spider-man . Here he also comes into contact with the cosmic rays and the armor he built in the comic just starts to form on him . They make mention of his homeland , but I am not sure if he is the leader . To tell ya the truth I feel Arnold Schwarzenegger would have been the perfect Doom , but then I am not a movie maker so what do I know . Other than that for the most part I liked the movie . People have been complaining about the effects , but I thought they were pretty good , not top notch , but then this movie was not given an unlimited budget . Probably had something to do with the fact the Hulk underachieved , I doubt they were going to give this movie over a 150 million budget when the slightly more known Hulk didn't pull in all that much . Five or six years ago though , had this movie come out the effects would have been considered top notch , just not by todays standards . The Thing was great , it did look like rock , and all the others had their powers working good too . The fight with Doom could have been a bit longer , but this is an origin tale so they have to establish characters first . So in the end do not expect to be blown out of the water , but do expect a more basic summer popcorn flick .
Roger Moore . . . simply the second best Bond .	Of course Connery is first , but unlike some I feel Moore was a very good Bond in his own right . His first adventure as Bond is good to , as it is a simpler story involving a drug kingpin . It is also still the only Bond to feature an African American as the main Bond villan played brilliantly here by Yaphat Kotto . Heck , all his evil henchmen or as well including one called Tee-Hee who has a mechanical arm , Whisper the big guy with virtually no voice , and Baron Saboda who is really tall . All the voodoo stuff gets a little absurd , but I still find it a really enjoyable Bond flick and for Moore's first he does an excellent job as well . Jane Seymour plays the Bond girl here and she does alright herself . Though sadly missing from this one is Q , as he is only briefly mentioned , and the real lack of gadgets aside from a wrist watch that does a couple of things . All in all though the action makes up for this and the high speed boat chase is great .
Bizarre , but rather entertaining funny flick . . .	Perhaps it is Tim Burton's influence , but there is something I really enjoy about this movie that I would not otherwise like . I am not a big Pee Wee fan , however , this movie for me still works . I found it a very funny movie , though it took a bit on first viewing to really get it for me . I really didn't start really laughing good until the strange night time road sign scene . . . on subsequent viewings , though , I laugh all the way through it . This movie has a bright side and dark side to it , and that is what makes it work the contrast . The story , guy goes about his everyday life and does a little shopping , guy gets done shopping only to find his beloved bike stolen . . . after futile attempts to round up help guy goes to gypsy who sends him on a trip to the Alamo to retrieve the back . So yes , it is a cross country type movie , however this one is far from being typical . Our hero must help a prison escapee , hitch a ride with a ghost , and do various other things in order to finish his quest . You will see the strange along the way as there are bikers , rich guys with really big bath tubs and even Godzilla along on the trip . Then you finally have a daring pet shop rescue and a reunion of Pee Wee and all the fellows who shared in his really big adventure . Very funny and well worth the time .
As funny as " Meet the Parents " , but not as realistic .	Or to put it another way , I found it as funny , but not as believable as the first movie . Still it was a good comedy . . . once again Ben Stiller and Robert DeNiro are the stars of the show , but Dustin Hoffman and Streisand are very nice additions to the cast . It isn't without its flaws however , but neither was the first one . Though in this movie DeNiro's character seems to have reverted back to the way he was during " Meet the Parents " and in some aspects he seems even worse this time . The RV seems a bit much too , I don't think they just give those out in the CIA . However , those minor faults aside it is well worth a look . I love the way the movie started out with everything going perfect for Focker and his bride to be , but you know the exact moment when the tides begin to turn with a simple bloody nose . Then comes the trip to meet Gaylord's family and they are a bit on the eccentric side to say the least . Jinx the cat returns as do a lot of the original cast including a cameo from Owen Wilson near the end .
Prepare to descend into the very depths of fear .	I enjoyed this movie about six gals mainly from England going caving . The movie was fast paced once they got to the caves and did not let up until the finish . The story has a woman who the previous year lost both a husband and daughter to a very gruesome car accident . She was apparently an extreme sports junkie , but for the past year has been in mourning for the loss of her loved ones . Now , however , she reunites with some old friends and they are going caving , girls only . They are supposed to go to a rather simple cave to explore with no real danger or thrills , however one of the members of the group has decided instead to take them to a cave she discovered . . . and what the girls discover there is sheer terror . This movie was very effective , even before there are any kind of creatures introduced the movie was tense . There is a great scene involving being stuck in a tight place , a really dangers climbing the wall scene and a scene involving a broken leg . I mean the poor girls have virtually no shot at survival at this point then if all this is not bad enough there is something lurking in the caves and it likes to feast on flesh . So there ya go , finally a horror movie that does seemingly indeed put our cast in a virtually inescapable situation with no apparent way out . It is not all good though , I did not care for some of the character's behavior towards the end as I would hope one would rather lean on someone for support . Instead there is a rather shocking scene that to me seems petty . Wait and try to get out then settle differences . Still this horror movie was really good and tense .
Though not quite as good as say " Young Frankenstein " this one is still sure to please .	Another Mel Brooks movie that hits the mark this one is a rift on science fiction movies most notably the Star Wars movies . With a joke every second it seems this movie is fast and furious making jokes about how sheer crazy the speeds are of ships in other science fiction movies . It turns a formidable enemy of Jabba the Hut and make him the really quite gross , but funny Pizza the Hut , and it takes the cast of Star Wars in a new direction with the great choice for Lord Helmet of Rick Moranis . All the cast is rather good , however I just think a couple more usual Brook's former cast would have made the movie even better . Not that Brook's was not good as President Skrupe , but just think how funny say Harvey Korman could have been in that role . It could have been essentially the same role as the one he did in Blazing Saddles and that in itself would have been a funny joke . Also , not to bad mouth Patten or say he was bad as Roland , but just think of Gene Wilder in that role . I could just see him doing that combination scene . However , the rest of the cast was spot on as Brooks was great as Yogurt , Bill Pullman as the Luke / Han hybrid and of course John Candy as Barf . So for a very funny movie spoofing everything under the sun , but still managing to have its own plot and not simply recreating a scene ala any of those horrible spoofs like " Meet the Spartans " try this Mel Brooks laugh riot on for size .
After a more recent viewing of this movie , I rather liked it .	My first review of this movie was made when I had not seen this movie in at least ten years . I recently purchased it with the original Japanese voice track and I did enjoy it . Nothing to take seriously , but it is a Godzilla movie . Here we have a couple of guys that were in a dance contest helping this one guy by showing him a boat . The guy never tells them why , but it is to find his brother who was lost at sea . They find a boat and a person who seems to be the owner , although he seems a bit shady . He says they can sleep on the boat , but they must leave in the morning . The guy searching for his brother though sets them out to sea and our story really begins . They find an island , controlled by a terrorist organization known as the " red bamboo " . They have been using natives of nearby infant island as slaves to produce a special liquid . You see , this island is protected by the sea monster Ebirah , a giant lobster . It attacks everything that comes into its vicinity including the smallest of boats . In fact , it wrecks the four men who were in search of the one guys brother . While on the island , they join up with a native girl that escapes the " red bamboo " . They do some investigating and shockingly find an amazing discovery in the caves of the island . . . Godzilla asleep . Through a series of incidents involving almost getting captured our heroes must wake the giant beast up as a little distraction . And when Godzilla wakes up he is in a fighting mood . Ebirah , fighter planes , and even a giant bird who may or may not be Rodan all are gunning for Godzilla , but he is more than able to handle the challenge .
Would have been better if they established Gidorah a bit more .	This was a rather good Godzilla film , one that introduces us to a new monster that would become a regular foe for Godzilla in many films to come King Gidorah . The plot has a princess of a small island nation coming to Japan , but her plane explodes . She later turns up saying she is from Venus and predicting doom for all mankind . We learn in a strange television show that one of the Mothra twins from the previous movie have died , but the other one is doing fine as the twin girls sing a song for some kids on said strange television show . A girl who is part of some sort of mystery type show is trying to get to the girl is talking about dangers at a volcano , and a cop recognizes her as the princess he was supposed to protect had she made it to Japan . Well I am guessing this is Rodan's second appearance in a movie as he emerges from the volcano that was his apparent doom and Godzilla soon arises out of the ocean once again terrorizing mankind . If this were not bad enough a new monster emerges from a meteorite , a monster the princess who claims she is from Venus says destroyed her planet and wiped out all civilization . To top it all off the princess has the most persistent assassins ever as they try to knock her off even as Godzilla , Rodan , and King Gidorah are destroying the countryside . The movie is rather good , it comes on the heels of Godzilla vs Mothra and I was happy to here about the death of the other Mothra in the Japanese version as I don't think they went over this in the American one . Of course , Godzilla survived being tossed in the ocean , why wouldn't he ? He is kind of an ocean and land monster . Rodan also makes his second appearance and for some reason he and Godzilla just want to fight . At the end you have a big monster battle royal featuring Godzilla , Rodan and Mothra against the new threat who I thought should have had a few more scenes of him destroying things to establish him a bit more as a super heavy hitter . The assassins are a bit over the top too , as I think most people would give up after the monsters were running rampant and heading their way . So there you go , a new monster that would be one of Godzilla's most powerful foes . Though this begs the question who is Godzilla's most powerful foe , I say it is between Gidorah and MechaGodzilla and I will give the edge to MechaGodzilla as that robot has quite a few wins against Godzilla while in later movies Godzilla literally blew Gidorah's heads off and once completely vaporized him .
Keanu Reeves on the highway to hell .	Pretty good movie , nothing super , but a fun two hours nonetheless . This movie is about a guy who sees demons and angels and sends demons who are naughty back to hell . The catch ( there is always a catch ) is that he is dying of cancer and he is not going to heaven when he dies . Why , because he attempted suicide as a young man and according to this movie that means a one way trip to hell no matter how good you are . Well Constantine is not exactly an angel either , even though he performs exorcisms and such . Well a spear has been uncovered and the demons are doing things differently . . . Constantine must pair with a cop whose twin sister has committed suicide in order to find out the deal . Action and special effects abound aplenty in this movie with some pretty good action and a few doses of horror in there just for safe measure . It is not all good , however , because other than Reeves and Weisz ( the gal from the Mummy movies ) there is not another soul I recognize in this movie . This movie is also in need of a better bad guy as well as there really is not a well defined one here . Still though you are in for a ride as how many other movies feature a crucifix shotgun ?
Action comedy with Arnold .	Arnold is a good actor when he has the right guy directing him . One guy that does a good job directing him is James Cameron . Unfortunately , ever since Titanic it seems James has been on a very long hiatus and Arnold hasn't had a director to help him be his best . In this one Arnold is at his best as a spy , whose wife doesn't know he is a spy . In fact , she is kind of bored of him for the most part , and she wants some excitement . Well she gets it , as Arnold suspects she is cheating on him with Bill Paxton's character . If this is not bad enough , terrorist are planning to detonate a nuclear device . . . suffice to say Arnold stays busy in this one . The cast is great and even Tom Arnold is rather good in this one . There are some parts that made me squirm though as I would be the type to want to get revenge and all , but the stuff he does to his wife gets a bit too sadistic . Other than that though , there is a good mixture of action and comedy . The opening scene is great , almost like if Arnold was 007 and there is a really great climax to this one as well involving a fighter plane . All in all a good movie to watch that is enjoyable for all .
Very fast paced with the kills , however the first part is the more interesting section of the film .	Yes , this is a remake done by Rob Zombie so expect lots of kills and nudity and such . However , what I did not expect was the opening showing Myers as a little boy . Granted the first and original movie showed his first kill , but this one goes a lot further showing the home environment and school more and his time in the institution under Dr . Loomis's care . So this was by far the more interesting part of the film and it was nice to see the makings of a killer as it did not solely blame outside factors , but also what was inside the mind of the boy himself . After that we have a rather lengthy scene of Myer's escape and then we basically get to the remake portion of the film which flies by a bit to fast with the plot seemingly rushed to get us to the kills . I am not saying this section is bad , just not as well developed as the first part . You do get to see a lot of nudity , and kills so we are in the basic slasher movie at this point and I do have to say that the girl playing the sheriff's daughter is extremely cute . You get your stars in this one , no one to big , but you know who they are . McDowell is rather good as Loomis , not quite as over the top as Pleasence was . There is a bit of a surprise at the end , well not really . . . I have seen to many horror movies to be surprised by what happened . As for a sequel , I think there could be one made , however if not that is fine . Actually , I would prefer there not be one , Rob Zombie should make more horror movies in maybe a different genre of horror , I am thinking a zombie movie might be interesting . So for a horror movie / slasher that is a bit different in the beginning and more basic in the end , this one is a real killer .
Oddly enough , my favorite Rocky movie .	This Rocky movie is a rather quick flowing film compared to the first movies and features a bit more comedy while still having drama and inspirational scenes that were pivotal in the first two movies . The fights are different here too , as in this film we do not have the 15 round beat downs of the first films , but rather three rounds of pure hard hitting . In this one we start out with a strange charity match as Rocky the heavyweight champion of boxing goes against the heavyweight champion of wrestling , Thunderlipps ( Hulk Hogan in his only decent appearance in a movie , then again it is not really a stretch ) . This match is rather entertaining and funny , but soon Rocky must face a new challenger to his belt , the very tough Clubber Lang played by a very tough Mr . T . Mickey does not want Rocky to fight this guy as Mickey has seen that Rocky has lost the fire in his eyes that got him the title and would most likely lose to this determined if a bit arrogant new fighter . Well they do end up fighting and Rocky loses and gets hit even worse by the passing of his mentor . Apollo having witnessed the fight and not liking Clubber Lang at all offers to help Rocky train and thus a new friendship is born . The training is nice to watch and I like how Rocky does different strategies against Clubber in the final fight . Sure this movie is a bit more over the top than the previous Rocky movies , it to me is still my favorite .
Good , but a bit overrated .	First , let me say that I enjoy this movie immensly and gave it an 8 , but I don't think it is the best in the series , or even Connery's best for that matter . For some reason though this one is always held in very high esteem . Some say it is where Connery really hit his stride as Bond , but I thought he was just as good in " From Russia With Love " . The problem I find with the movie is when Bond goes to Kentucky , it just isn't that exotic of a location for a Bond movie . I love the first half where he is simply driving after Goldfinger , but then he is captured and the movie kinda gets bogged down as he tries to escape or at least get word to Felix about Goldfinger's plan . All that said though it is still a thouroughly enjoyable pic . The conclusion more than makes up for my perceived dead spot and there are an assortment of enjoyable characters like Oddjob and Pussy Galore ( though that has to be the stupidest name , no parent would name their kid that ) .
Now that is how the Predator should be portrayed ! ! !	I enjoyed this film quite a bit . Though I see from the score here , it was not the opinion shared by the majority of people . However , the fact I liked it so much may have less to do with this movie itself , but rather the fact the last three horror movies I have watched have been so darn slow and really really bad in one instance . The story picks up right after the first movie , as there is an alien / predator hybrid and it causes a predator ship to crash land in a rural Colorado town . Before you know it , face huggers that the predators have on board are out finding people to attach themselves to . Meanwhile , a dying predator on board sends out a signal to the alien home world and here comes a predator to the rescue ! ! ! Not really , he is quite the killer , as you can tell he is a seasoned veteran among predators , unlike the rookies we got in the first film . Which is partly why I liked this one more , in the first one I really wanted to see the predator kick some butt , here he does in a big way . I have also wanted to see an alien invasion on earth and I got that too , just not in the big way I have always imagined , basically an all out alien attack . Still , lots of blood and lots of predator super weapons and alien tail and mouth action to make me happy . . . well not all about it was perfect . It suffers from one to many story lines as far as the people in the movie , boy in love , guy returns to town , woman returns from military duty , a sheriff not quite sure what to do . . . made me enjoy the pizza guy whose story was simply a warm body to kill . Also , the fight at the end with the predator and the predalien could have lasted a tad longer . Also , there was the fact it was a bit hard to see what in the world was going on at times as well . Still , I wasn't expecting a work of art , just lots of kills and a fun ride .
Its one hell of a trip ! ! !	I caught this movie a long time ago , late at night , and I really enjoyed it . It just worked for me and was a lot of fun . This movie has a guy's fiancé kidnapped by some weird cop . Turns out this cop is from hell and he has taken the girl to be Satan's new bride . The guy gets some help from an old gentleman who apparently had the same thing happen to him . The old man gives the guy a gun and the guy goes to hell to get back his girl . The movie does really well at presenting hell for an obviously low budget movie . You get the feeling you are in another world . There is plenty of action and comedy here too , though not much in the way of horror . The guy gets some help here and there and runs into various obstacles along his way and he gets to see the many sights and sounds that hell has to offer . My personal favorite was the road of good intentions . This movie goes at a good clip too , and it rarely slows down and there are a few twists along the way as well . The movie for me works on almost every level and if you ever have a chance to watch this little gem do so .
My favorite in the series . . . I think .	I liked this movie quite a lot and I think it is my favorite . Why do I say think ? Because the first two were fun to watch , but were not what you would call memorable movies . This one may not be either so I had better review it now lest I forget it and just say it was entertaining , but I don't remember much about it . This one has Ethan Hunt being tortured with his wife about to be killed before him right at the get go . It then shifts to an early time and this was a very nice plot device because I was actually curious to see how he got into that predicament and how he would get out of it . There is a rather cool rescue scene and another where our team must try to capture a weapons dealer . There is one good action scene after another quite frankly and this time Ethan Hunt has a good IMF team behind him and they actually seem to be helpful . This one also has a very good bad guy a few twists along the way ( though nothing to hard to figure out ) and it has a rather interesting part of the movie where Hunt is getting something for the bad guy but you never get to see any of it except before he enters the building and when he abruptly leaves said building . This movie is not without its flaws , however , to me it was the best one of the series and one heck of an action movie . . . at least I think I liked it more than the other two .
Nice to know even in the future the shotgun still does some damage .	This game was not quite what I was expecting and was for the most part a lot of fun . It is a role playing game through parts of it and a Gears of War shooter as well . The story has you as Shepard , who has a default look to him or you can make him or her to your tastes . He is trying to become the first human Spetre in a strange and vast intergalactic government system . However , you must go through a lot of trials as aliens called Geth are on the attack and another Spectre agent named Saren has gone rogue . The graphics are great , the story interesting , the fighting so so . It is like Gears of War , just not quite as tight . I also did not care for the driving around on planets much at all . However , I loved the role playing elements which sort of were like Knights of the Old Republic only a bit better . You can talk to various people at times and pick up missions that can be simple get an item missions or be more complicated to the point of going to multiple planets and eliminating an enemy threat . The main story has great points , I especially like the part where Shepard and the true enemy have their first meeting . So for a cool science fiction role playing action game I can not recommend anything better than this .
Very good story and atmosphere . . . just what you expect in Silent Hill .	This one I like a bit less than part two , but they are almost even in their enjoyment value . However , my favorite of the series now has to be Silent Hill Origins thanks to a vastly improved combat and movement system . This one has a good story of a girl who while at the mall starts to see weird things , then of course monsters show up and our gal named Heather must navigate the demented mall , which gets even more demented after a ride in an elevator . She also has to navigate the subways , sewers , and office buildings . . . all this before she even gets to Silent Hill ! And once you get to Silent Hill you will be amazed at how foggy it is ! The story is great as it seems to be a sequel to the first one , and of course Origins fits nicely in there too . I would elaborate on it more , but I don't want to give to much away . . . except I will say I hated that Claudia woman a lot . Those religious nuts always get my blood boiling . So there you have it , the atmosphere is also killer , I loved how you switched over to the more deformed and evil world and the puzzles were not to difficult to piece together . The problems come in the combat . . . a weakness for all Silent Hill games , you often get damaged and killed less because of your skill and more for the camera angles . Granted this makes it a bit more scary I guess , but I hate when the camera pans to the front of you when I need to see what is ahead . It is also sometimes to hard as I had a bit of difficulty with the final enemy even on easy . Still all in all this was a great survival horror game .
The second movie of Godzilla's island adventures .	This movie and " Godzilla vs the sea monster " makes up a double header of Godzilla movies where almost all the action takes place on an island . Both are pretty good , and I can't really say I have a preference for one or the other . This movie has Godzilla at the beginning of the movie seemingly going in the direction of some mysterious waves that cause interference with radars and such . The waves are coming from an island where a team of scientists are conducting weather control research . A reporter kind of invades their little clan , but quickly joins it . They begin the experiment , but as things are going smoothly the interference comes and causes the experiment to go bad . The island heats to to very high degrees and the giant mantis's on the island get super big . They find and egg that turns out to be a baby Godzilla whose screams for the bigger Godzilla are the cause for the interference . Godzilla makes his way to the island to protect and teach one of his own . I am not sure if it is really Godzilla's own offspring , or just the fact they are the same species that brings Godzilla . While on the island the scientists have their troubles such as the heat , a strange sickness , and some of the group going crazy and Godzilla has his such as keeping his son in line ( which is kind of hard ) , fighting the mantis , and a huge spider . All in all a nice little Godzilla flick to watch . On a side note , both footage from this movie and the sea monster movie would literally combine to form the atrocious Godzilla's Revenge .
Kind of a cross between Tomb Raider Legends and Gears of War .	I liked this game for the most part , but I was hoping for something a bit more original , however , if you have played the two games listed above then this is not going to be anything new game play wise . However , it makes up for it by having a rather good story , and I did enjoy the game play in said two games . Just to warn you though , I was cussing at certain parts of the game and I had it set to easy . The story , typical search for the treasure scenario as Nathan and his buddies are after a treasure sought by Sir Francis Drake . You have your typical bad guys and you have numerous shoot outs , which is one of the problems I had with this game . There are two many go here then to the next screen all basic shootouts . These shootouts get annoying , especially when the enemy is seemingly dead on all the time . I just wish with all the advances in gaming they could dumb down the enemy a bit . I can't stand it when you get locked on immediately , it would be nice if for once the enemy would lose sight of you at times as that would be more realistic . The exploring is straight out of Tomb Raider Legends and fun for the most part , and then there is the end which spiced things up with strange things to kill , things that would seem more in place in a horror survival game than in this setting . Still , it was fun , the ending was good and I could see playing another game featuring these characters again . Next time I hope they work on the hand to hand more as you just did not get a lot of opportunity to really use it much .
Great fun to be had as it goes from one story to another .	This movie follows a guy and gal through their adventures in a realm where good is constantly fighting evil and it seems to take the form of old horror movies for the most part . There is a lot of fun to be had as they go into this mirror world in search of the means to prove the girl's innocence from a bizarre murder . They first enter a sort of Frankenstien story and this one is pretty good , then they separate and the female goes into an Alien type movie , which I found to be sort of weak , but the guy goes into the highlight for me , an old haunted house tale with a very funny Bruce Campbell . The scene with the salt and lemon juice had me laughing good . Then it wraps up with the longest of the stories one in a medieval era with a crazed psycho trying to take power through strange means . This one runs a little long , but it has another great set of scenes as our hero battles the villain through several worlds . This movie has a great combo of horror , comedy and action and is a very good B movie .
Using the innovative wheel for combat this is a fun sort of horror rpg .	I enjoyed this rpg , I considered buying at one point until I read a really negative review , but I later bought it used and have since learned never read reviews about role playing games again . Typically , the reviewers like the ones I hate , and hate the ones I love with the exception of Final Fantasy . So , to this game , the most unique aspect of it is the judgment wheel used during battle and at other times during your quest . It makes battle a bit more interesting as you can cause more damage depending on if you hit in orange or red zones or miss all together if you miss . This keeps one interested in the battles , at least it did me . The story is rather interesting as well , as it is sort of horror based , but as it wears on it gets kind of a science fiction vibe to it instead . I would have preferred it stay more horror myself . . . there is also a bit of humor in it as well , but not as much as you are going to find in the two sequels . The plot follows a young man named Yuri as he helps a young girl named Alice escape from a powerful sorcerer . The game goes from Asia to Europe and you become allies with all sorts of interesting chaps along the way . I like the way the game happens in the real world instead of a fantasy world as this is a nice change of pace . So other than the fact of the change from horror to more light hearted game and the absolutely bizarre story telling modes which are poked fun at in the sequels this one is a very interesting and different type of role playing game .
The start of it all .	This was the first teaming of Mel Gibson and Danny Glover and still one of the best . I liked part two a bit more . This one though has it all : action , drama , comedy ( though I don't think comedy should be the first one listed like it is on imdb ) . The story . . . a hooker takes a plunge off a building and Glover is assigned to the case . He is also assigned a new partner Riggs ( Mel Gibson ) , who is a suicidal cop who gets quite berserk at times . The investigation leads to an old Special Forces unit dealing in drugs . Along the way Riggs helps a potential suicide jumper , Murtaugh ( Glover ) invites Riggs to dinner , and the Special Forces unit kidnap Murtaugh's daughter . Great action ensues here as it leads to one heck of a fight on a front lawn .
Cool fighting system . . . good story make this a good role playing game .	The fighting system here is turn based , however , instead of each side taking a turn you have a bar and whoever reaches the end first goes next . Could be your side , could be the enemies . Wait , there is more . . . using special attacks or hard hits your turn or the enemies turn can be pushed back giving you or them more turns . Sounds complicated , but not really . The magic system and how you learn magic and special attacks is more of a pain than the actual fighting . However , the story for me is what makes a really good rpg and this has that too . You are a young adventurer who yearns to discover new places and see new things . Unfortunately , there apparently is not anything to explore anymore . Still , Justin is persistent and through a series of events brought on by a strange figure at some old ruins , Justin sets sail to find out the mysteries of the dungeon and others like them . We are treated to a rather humorous boat ride where a friend of Justin's , Sue has stowed away and makes life a bit rougher on Justin . They both soon meet up with Feena , and they embark on many adventures together through various locales , even scaling a massive wall thought to be the end of the world itself . They meet and part with many other characters along the way and discover a strange and dangerous monster . The main problem I had with this one is the ending is a tad weak , however it is more than offset by the rest of the story which also involve cozy little dinners which become a staple of the Grandia series . So for a game that isn't quite as good graphically , but matches up rather well story wise to the final fantasy series , give this little gem a try .
My favorite Prince of Persia game . . . has the best flow .	Yes , this game is the final installment for this particular prince of Persia , a new one is waiting in the wings . However , as far as this prince is concerned this is the best game he is in . The reason , it does the best job incorporating the fighting and the acrobatics the best of the three . Basically , the fighting is fun and you have plenty of the wall running to really keep you entertained . Throw into that more boss fights than the previous two installments could muster and a nice little change in the prince as he becomes a dark self . It even has the addition of stealth kills that are easy to do and look very cool . The game is a bit short though , and the way it picked up with the sorceress of time alive as she died on the only play through I did in Warrior Within . Which means you should not make your game multiple ending and pick up only one of the possible endings in the next installment . So here we have an old villain emerge , an old ally emerge and a very dark side of the prince emerge . The dark prince side is rather cool and can slice and dice opponents very effectively . His main drawback is that water is a weakness of his and he slowly but surely runs out of health . Still he can replenish it by killing enemies and he does that quite well . The regular prince is still effective to at what he does and fighting and stealth kills are his thing too . You do not go over the same territory in this one like in Within so the game remains fresh . There is a chariot race like scene in this one , but not that great . It is okay , but it does not really add anything . So for my money all in all this is the best of the three prince of Persia games .
Could be Final Fantasy XIII if it wanted to be .	Yes , this more so than part twelve of Final Fantasy seems more like that series . However , it is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination as I almost gave this game an eight instead and it probably deserves an eight more . The story has an immortal named Kaim who has no memories of his past sent on a mission to explore an object called Grand Staff . He is joined by Seth another fellow immortal and Jansen who tags along at the request of the obvious villain Gongorra . During your many adventures Kaim regains his lost memories , his lost love , and his lost for good loved ones . The fighting is basically turned based using at times a ring system that when timed right can cause extra damage in battles , causes elemental damage , and can inflict status ailments . Sort of like Shadow Hearts , but not quite as involved or as good . I like Hearts better cause there you used the rings for everything . . . here you only use it for the standard attack . The music is okay , though kind of minimal as it does not exactly blow you away . However , the music was very good during the cut scenes called a thousand years of dreams , a series of stories telling of Kaim's past . Most of them are rather sad , but they add a lot to the game . The problems with the game though are many too . One , Cooke and Mack are a bit annoying at times and they are in the story a lot . I wish Sed was in the story more than these two kiddies . There is also the fact that Kaim is the main character for most of the game , but he does not stand out in any way at the end , really standing back as the pirate Seth takes center stage . Then there is the loading . Why on a next generation console is there so much loading ? Why is the game broken down on four disks and they can not do a better job of transitions than they did is beyond me . Look at Final Fantasy X . . . all on one disc , but it flowed very smoothly . It was also a Ps2 game . I just do not get this at all . However , for the most part you are in store for a really good game , the fighting is fun , the side quests easy enough to do , and the ending was rather good as well . So for the most part a fun role-playing game for the Xbox 360 .
Fast , fun , Science fiction flick .	This movie is remarkably well-paced and really fun to watch . It is full of color and the effects are rather good for this time as well . Good cast for the most part as well . . . Max Von Sydow is perfect as Ming . I don't think this one did super great at the box office though , and that may be in part to Sam Jones as Flash . I think he did a rather good job , but a bigger star may have helped its take at the theaters . The story has Flash as a quarterback flying with a gal . Ming has begun an attack on earth by making natural disasters pummel the earth with the finale being the moon crashing into the earth . The plane they are on crashes into this scientist's base . He has a rocket they use to go find out the cause of the disasters . Great scenes abound , as there is a great football scene , a cool swamp scene , and a great all out attack on a space cruiser . All in all this one is just a lot of fun to watch . On a side note there are also a lot of Bond connections . Timothy Dalton , of course played Bond , Max Von Sydow played the leader of spectar in " Never Say Never Again " , and Topal was a Bond ally in " For Your Eyes Only " .
The movie where Godzilla just about kicks everyone's booty .	This movie starts with Godzilla being trapped in ice by a group piloting a strange ship , it then flashes forward to the present where they use these ships to subdue all sorts of monsters . However , not all is perfect as all sorts of monsters seemingly strike at random from everywhere . . . but not to worry help arrives in the form of some very helpful aliens . Of course they have ulterior motives and thus an onslaught of earths toughest monsters commences . Good Godzilla movie as we get to see a lot of monsters , though I was disappointed in Hedorah's scene in the film as it did absolutely nothing in the movie . One of Godzilla's toughest foes ever reduced to a very short scene . Still for the most part I liked it . Because with most of the Earth's defenses wiped out and monsters running rampant they only have one place to turn . . . the south pole where Godzilla is trapped in ice and when released goes on a monster killing rampage which includes our stupid American version of Godzilla which is not much of a fight , but then who thought it would be ? There are problems with the movie , because at times you almost forget it is a Godzilla movie as the focus turns to the humans fighting the aliens and it seems kind of like the Matrix or something in these parts . Still , you get to see plenty of monsters , I like the way Gigan was kind of a focus in this one as he is one of my favorites . Some of the monster usage is puzzling though , why Ebirah instead of say Megalon ? Why have Hedorah in it at all if he isn't really going to do anything at all ? Why does Monster X at the end have to turn out being . . . wait I don't want to ruin it for you , the cover of the DVD will do that for you . Still it is a cool movie especially if you want to see Godzilla stomp a mud hole in everything he fights and you want to see the last Godzilla movie in a while end actually good . . . then this is for you .
Rather good as it is the first Final Fantasy true sequel .	I am a bit surprised to see this one ranked rather low here compared to other FF games , however , I thought it was great to revisit some of the characters I got to know from Final Fantasy X . An actual sequel this game features Yuna and Rikku along with a newcomer named Paine as sphere hunters . Granted Yuna is mainly doing this as a means to see if an old love is still alive . The format is different from X as it is more of a mission based and chapter based game . The story is still rather engaging , but combat is a bit tough this time around . Apparently , Rikku and Yuna have gotten vastly weaker since X . During the story you run into many old friends from ten and some new ones as there are different parties forming in the wake of the final destruction of Sin . So you have your intrigue plus quite a bit of comedy for your enjoyment as well . Still , this is not a true Final Fantasy game and it doesn't feel like one . . . the problem with going back to a world is you don't see all that much new stuff . There are not all that many new areas to explore much of it looks exactly the same so lets just say it does have a familiar ring to it . Still it is fun and the ending was good too . Though I have yet to see the 100 % completion ending .
The ending to a very good , but rather odd set of movies .	The first movie was Evil Dead then came Evil Dead II and finally this little gem , Army of Darkness . The first one was almost pure horror , while the second interjected some humor here and there , but was still mainly a horror while this one has very little horror at all and is more of an action comedy . Once again this movie sort of picks off where the previous movie leaves off , sort of as we have our hero Ash transported back to medieval times where he is mistaken for a member of an opposing army . The previous movie had him hailed as a hero right away , but here he is taken prisoner and forced to fight the evil dead in a very cool pit fighting scene . He quickly wins the respect of the ones who tried to kill him and he is sent on a quest to fetch a book that has the ability to send away the evil dead and help him get back to his own time . What ensues are some very funny scenes and a rather big battle at the end which is also rather funny , lets face it seeing a guy picking up obvious fake skeletons and acting like they are attacking is just humorous . Bruce Campbell is great in this movie , however no one else in the cast really sticks out all that much except for the main villain who also just happens to be Bruce Campbell . Still he carries this movie and he is enough for one funny action horror movie .
Very good and epic military video game .	Yes , this sequel to the 2006 game is explosive and very good , a bit better than the original game . The characters are back and just as wise cracking as ever and the story that unfolds is better than that of a lot of movies . The game play for the most part remains the same . You engage in a lot of fire fights where you duck and cover and shoot from the cover . A few differences in this one is that the chainsaw bayonet from the first game is used more here as I carved up a lot more enemies with it this time around . Another difference is the ability to use your downed enemies as shields . There are also more vehicles to use as you have your standard tank like vehicle and a couple of more unique ones . This game features a rather climatic ending too as well as a hint of a sequel in the future . The story has Marcus and Dom joined by some new characters and returning ones fighting the locust horde from beneath the earth once again . They have a plan to attack the locust and try to end the war with them once and for all . Along the way you have some humor as Carmine a new recruit to the Gears has some problems at first and one scene with the gang in the dark after a vehicle jump . At first I thought I did something wrong , but hearing them chat in the dark was rather funny . You also have a sad scene or two as well . So for one hell of an explosive game that is fun to play give Gears of War 2 a try . Though you really should play the first one so you know the whole story .
Fallout 3 a test of survival in the capital wasteland .	This type of role playing game is usually not my thing . I prefer the Final Fantasy type role playing games to the ones that are comparable to this such as Elderscrolls . However , once I left the vault I was completely hooked on this very fun game . You start out in said vault where you learn basic skills that will help you later when traversing the desolate wasteland . You also have the opportunity to build up your stats to your liking and what your character looks like . It took a bit to grasp how to level in this game , but it was rather easy once I figured it out and quite easy to make a warrior of the wasteland suited to your tastes . Your father escapes this vault and you are soon to follow and entering the wasteland for the first time is quite something . I was very impressed with the detail and layout of this land . So I headed for a town called Megaton and used this for my base of operations for the entire game . In the game you complete quests and such to gain experience and earn bottle caps which in this world is the source of money . You can also loot many abandoned places and nearly everything you find can be sold for some more bottle caps . The main quest is somewhat interesting as you follow the footsteps of your father and try to find out what he is trying to do , but quite frankly the other quests not relating to the main one are more fun for the most part . Though I did like the black and white world in the main quest the last quest in the main quest was a bit too easy . Some examples of the optional quests include helping a local write a book on how to survive the wasteland , helping this group who worship a tree , ridding a town of their ant problem and so on and so forth . So for the most part this game is great the fighting is not the best when you do not use this mod called v . a . t . s cause it is rather hard to aim out of it , but it is still rather fun with a very huge arsenal of weapons that you can find and armor too . I just say they needed to do more in the main quest portion of the game , work out some of the bugs as this game froze up a couple of times and a character would not move to where he was supposed to so I had to physically push him , and make the ending a bit more grand in keeping with the rest of the game . Still , for the most part this game was great with a variety of things to do and I was good on this play through next time I am planning on being ultra evil . . . so long Megaton .
Better than I expected .	I thought this movie would be pretty good , but from the trailers I thought there would be way to many characters . For the most part though they mainly focused on those who returned from the first movie , with only Nightcrawler and Pyro being the only new characters that showcased their powers . I was a bit disappointed not to see much of Colossus , and Iceman didn't really do much , but aside from that this one was really good . I also wished Cyclops was in it more , but that made for an interesting sidepiece as this movie takes place on three fronts . McKellan is great as Magneto and all the other cast is rather good as well . Though I loved watching Magneto escape from the prison . Lady Deathstrike really didn't have too much screen time and she had only one line , but she had one heck of a fight with Wolverine in this one . Though I wish their fight was a bit longer . The highlights of this one include of course the fight with Wolvie and Deathstrike , the cool opening scene with Nightcrawler , the scene where Pyro goes berserk , and the scene where the troops raid Xavier's school . There are other cool scenes in there , but these were my favorites . I don't think the movie ended as weak as some movie critics have said it did , but it wasn't the best feature of the film . I also didn't care for the introduction of the Phoenix character they gave flashes of throughout . I don't know if it will go with the movie formula all that well . All in all a good film , could have ended better , but I am just being picky .
A good flick .	This DBZ movie is very good . It is the only movie so far that I have seen where you get to see Master Roshi fight . Sure the fight doesn't last long , but he does good for a bit . This movie is about a crazy doctor who is now a brain in a jar . This guy wants the strongest person in the world so he can have his body . He hasn't been around lately so he mistakes Master Roshi for the strongest , but Bulma tells him that Goku is . Goku is on his way to rescue them and a bunch of cool fighting begins . Gohan , Krillin , and Picallo also are on hand for the fight .
The game that made me a Final Fantasy fan .	I was not a huge fan of the first Final Fantasy game , however , I loved this game when it was released as Final Fantasy II . It was just vastly different at the time to anything I was used to . I loved the scenes where the characters acted own their own to add to the story , the music seemed great , and the story was very well played out . The fighting was good too , but this game was mainly story based as the story was more important than the fighting . Here it is turned based , and even though today it looks a bit odd seeing basically a picture blink to indicate an attack it is still great in its simplicity . The story follows Cecil who is a dark knight on a quest for redemption and to discover the mystery's of the crystals . He finds many comrades to aid him along the way , and villains to try and obstruct it . You have your basic element villains and other villains who seem to have connections with our heroes . There is nothing like this game still as the story still sparks emotion as there is a lot of self sacrifice to occur . You travel many lands in this one , including the lands of the drawf and you even get to fly into space . You have your humorous characters and you have your super magic attacks and summons . In this one the characters are also all rather unique unlike other final fantasy where there are no real differences between characters . So all in all still one of the best .
