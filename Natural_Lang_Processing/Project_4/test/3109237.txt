Nothing to Recommend	- Let me start by saying that I understand that Invasion of the Star Creatures was meant to be a parody of the sci-fi films of the 50s . I understand that none of it is to be taken seriously . The problem I have is that none of it works . A parody should be funny and this one just isn't . Not once during the entire runtime did I so much as crack a smile . In general , I am easily entertained , but I couldn't find a sliver of entertainment anywhere in Invasion of the Star Creatures . - I knew I was in trouble right from the beginning . The two " stars " make their screen appearance with one of the lamest gags imaginable - a water hose they can't control that gets them both wet . These two come off as Bowery Boys wannabes . Why anyone would want to mime the act and persona of the Bowery Boys is beyond me . After the less than illustrious beginning , the movies goes on to feature comical chase sequences , dancing Indians , vegetable men , decoder rings , and other assorted unfunny bits . It's all just a complete waste of time . - I bought this on the double feature DVD with Invasion of the Bee Girls . That movie is Academy Award winning stuff in comparison with Invasion of the Star Creatures .
" Look at the beautiful , speening wheel . See how it speens ! "	Calling The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies " bad " doesn't begin to cover how wretched this movie really is . The word " bad " just doesn't seem strong enough . Everything about this movie reeks like a Diaper Genie left out in the sun on a hot summer day . I don't mind a bad movie every now and then , but this one is too much . The actual plot of the movie could have been told in about 15 minutes . A fortune-teller hypnotizes a young man and has him do her bidding . That's basically it . There are a few zombie-like creatures that pop up near the end , but by that point in the movie it's hard to care . The rest of the movie's 60 + minute runtime is filled with shots of carnival rides and bad nightclub acts . And the acts are just painful to watch . The carnival barker outside the tent promises exotic dancing women . In this case exotic means butt-ugly and dancing means something choreographed for a pre-school recital . I feel sorry for anyone who finds entertainment in these scenes . Ray Dennis Steckler has to be on of the most untalented directors to ever step behind a camera . In comparison , Ed Wood is Alfred Hitchcock and Andy Milligan is Akira Kurosawa . From what I've seen so far of his work , Steckler seems incapable of making a watchable movie . Acting , script , plot , and even sound seem to be completely foreign to him . He's terrible . For whatever reason , I've now seen The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies twice . On this , my second viewing , I was fortunate enough to see the MST3K version . If you are a fan of the show , this is one of the better episodes . The comedy and commentary are dead on and hilarious . I would strongly advice against watching this movie any other way .
" It's cool , we just killed somebody . No big deal . "	After writing back-to-back negative reviews for Werewolf ( 1996 ) and Track of the Moon Beast ( 1976 ) , I almost hate to make it three in a row with Zombie Nightmare . I've thought about raising one of the ratings because I really hate to seem so negative . But if you've seen this trifecta of cinematic crap , you'll understand that I really have no choice . Zombie Nightmare deserves the ? just like Werewolf and Track of the Moon Beast . It's pretty much bad in every way a movie can be . It's got it all ? bad acting , poor special effects , ridiculous plot , weak technical aspects , and unlikable characters . I've used this expression several times recently , but Gawd awful also applies to Zombie Nightmare . Actually , I do have one positive thing to write about the movie . Somehow , the makers of this garbage were able to secure the rights to ( or possibly just had the good sense to use ) Motörhead's " Ace of Spades " for the opening credits . Lemmy rocks !
Someone should have fed this movie to the shark	This is one really bad movie . I've racked my brain and I cannot come up with one positive comment to make . The acting is atrocious . I've seen more believable performances on cable access . The plot is ridiculous . Stolen diamonds , secret recordings of the President , and a shark that attacks anything that gets near it should have made for cheesy fun at the worst . Night of the Sharks isn't even so bad it's good . The dialogue sounds and is delivered as if it were written seconds before it's filmed . And to top it off , Night of the Sharks has the worst soundtrack I've ever heard . I'm surprised my ears didn't start bleeding from the 80s techno synthesized sounds that someone actually bothered to record . From everything I've read , the Italian film industry was dead by 1987 . Night of the Sharks is like a final nail in the coffin .
So wretched that I felt like retching	A junkyard owner is approached by two hoods to help them with an armored car heist they have planned . Although hesitant at first , he agrees after meeting and falling for a stripper trying to break into acting . He wants the money to help her get away from the seedier side of Hollywood . The robbery goes off as planned , but the would-be criminals turn on each other with disastrous consequences . I've seen a lot of bad movies over the years , but only a handful fall into the I-want-to-gouge-my-eyes-out category . Hollywood After Dark is one such movie . It's bottom of the barrel in every respect . The acting is horrendous ; the plot is a disaster ; the direction is Coleman Francis-ish ; the stripper scenes are mind-numbingly awful ; and on it goes . Hollywood After Dark is a tawdry , dirty , and depressing mess of a movie . I wasn't sure when the movie ended if I should take a shower or slit my wrists . It's that bad ! And if the movie wasn't already wretched enough , just wait until Rue McClanahan takes the stage for her burlesque number . That's right ? Golden Girl Rue McClanahan is a stripper ! It's one of those moments that I could have gone all my life without seeing . Now that I've got that visual back in my head , add retching to my list of things I thought about doing after watching the movie !
Unless you're a masochist , stay away from this one .	Is it possible to " rape " a movie ? That's how I would describe Roger Corman and Company's treatment of the Russian film Planeta Bur . Taking footage from that film and adding some terrible sequences he filmed , Peter Bogdanovich created one fine mess of a movie . Other than the nonsensical narration he recorded himself , Bogdanovich's creative contribution to Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women appears to have been the film he shot of Mamie Van Doren and a half-dozen other women lounging on the coast of California . It's so cheaply done that there is no actual dialogue as shooting sound would have been too costly ( not to mention these women probably couldn't act to save their lives ) . This footage was then sloppily edited with the Russian film to create this dull , pointless , plot less " thing " that has no entertainment value whatsoever . I don't know when I've been so bored and ready for a movie to end . It's excruciating . I like a lot of the low-budget , no-budget films of the 60s , but I would rather have a tooth pulled than sit through Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women again . Unless you're a masochist , stay away from this one .
Painfully BA	Revolt of the Zombies is BAD . There is nothing remotely entertaining about the movie . It is dull , lifeless , poorly acted , and poorly scripted . I've often complained that the original Dracula is a little slow for my taste , well this movie makes Dracula look like a roller coaster ride . The 65 minute running time seemed like 165 minutes . The story : An expedition is sent to Cambodia to find the secrets of mind control through " zombification " . One man finds the secret and uses it to make the woman he loves marry him . Once this happens , he releases the zombies under his control to horrific consequences . That's it . That's the whole story . For most of the movie , I was trying to figure out where I had seen the male lead . He looked so familiar . I had plenty of time to think this over . Nothing was happening in the movie . Just before the " zombies revolted " , it hit me . It was Dean Jagger . I had seen him recently as the General in White Christmas . This is how I " entertained " myself throughout most of the movie . I'm just glad I didn't buy the DVD for this movie . King of the Zombies is on the other side and it's a masterpiece of film making compared with this movie . For what it's worth , I'll give it a . ( I won't go to because , believe it or not , I've seen worse . )
A good example of an Ed Wood movie not made by Ed Wood	Where to begin ? The plot is so convoluted that I don't know if I can do it justice . I'll give it a brief try . Dr . Leland Masterson , intrigued by the work of Dr . Aranya , visits his secret underground lab to gain an insight on the work he is performing . He is shocked to learn that Dr . Aranya is injecting spider fluids into humans and human fluids into spiders . The result ? indestructible spider-women ( or dwarfs in the case of the men ) and giant , deadly spiders . Masterson is attacked and goes insane . He later escapes from the asylum and hijacks a plane carrying a couple on their way to be married , an Asian servant , Masterson's nurse , and the pilot . The plan crashes on a deserted mesa not far from Dr . Aranya's hideout . Can anyone escape alive from the Mesa of Lost Women ? I thought about doing one of those reviews I've done in the past where I list what worked in the movie and what didn't work . It would look something like this : What Works : - Nothing . What Doesn't Work : - Everything . Mesa of Lost Women is so inept that it would take pages to cover it all . Acting , plot , pacing , special effects , dialogue , and everything else you can think of are as bad as anything Ed Wood ever made . Here's a laundry list of just a few of the things that didn't work : 1 . The voice-over narration . The narrator tries to be clever but just comes off as ridiculous when none of his jokes hit their mark . 2 . The relationship between the pilot and the woman . This bride-to-be is way to quick to dump her frumpy husband-to-be once the hunky pilot shows up . Their kiss is nausea inducing . 3 . The spider-women . Are these things supposed to be menacing ? 4 . Dr . Aranya . The movie tries hard to let us know that Dr . Aranya is evil . Just take a look at the guy . He's got a bad eye , a wart , and seems more interested in his high school test tube rack than in human life . 5 . The Asian servant . His double cross of the others on the plane would make the team of Mission Impossible proud . The fact that he not only knew the plane would crash , but that he knew exactly where the plane would crash obviously took some incredible planning . 6 . Tarantella's dance . I suppose it's meant to be seductive , but to whom , I'm not sure . 7 . Do I really need to go any further ? None of this is meant to imply that there aren't moments in the movie to enjoy . This is one of those movies that I do not hesitate to call " so bad it's good " . For those in the right frame of mind , there's a laugh to be had around almost every corner of Mesa of Lost Women .
I never knew Miles O'Keeffe was from Tennessee ?	Another in the long line of Conan wannabes that tired to cash in on that movie's success , this Italian monstrosity is about as bad as they came . You know it's a bad sign when your heroes fight invisible enemies because the movie was made so cheaply there wasn't money for either adequate special effects or to hire real people . I won't even bother going into the plot as I defy anyone to follow it and make sense of the storyline . Maybe it's the television cut I watched , but I can't imagine any version being that much better . It all seems so random to me . Evil sorcerers , cavemen , giant snakes , medieval castles , grenades , and hang gliding ? none of it fits together . It's as if director Joe D'Amato had an epileptic fit while making Cave Dwellers ( or any of the other half-dozen names the movie goes by ) and threw everything he could think of onto the screen regardless of how unrelated it was or how it fit into the film's already puzzling plot . The acting is sufficiently bad . Miles O'Keeffe could never act his way out of a wet paper bag and he proves that once again in this movie . The rest of the cast is equally atrocious . Then there's the . . . well , you get the idea . It's late , I'm tired , and I've already wasted more than enough time writing about this piece of garbage . Take my word for it ? avoid Cave Dwellers ( or whatever you want to call it ) at all costs .
See the Original	Humanoids from the Deep ( 1996 ) is a remake of a 1980 film of the same name . The original was not the greatest , but the remake is horrible . The basic story : Through some crazy experimentation , death-row inmates have been mutated into killer ( for lack of a better word ) fishmen . They kidnap women with whom they mate . The father and boyfriend of one of the victims must save her before it's too late . The movie stars Robert Carradine and Emma Samms . For the most part , both act as if they would rather be anywhere than making this movie . Carradine actually sounds as if he's reading many of his lines . His lines are delivered with no emotion whatsoever . And what lines they are . Some of the silliest dialogue imaginable . The people populating this movie are especially dumb . Once it's established that fishmen are killing and abducting the citizens , do you think the townspeople cancel their water festival ? No ! They go right ahead . They seem genuinely surprised when the festival is invaded by the fishmen . What dolts ! The special effects are also weak . The fishmen are never seen in any one shot for very long . This is probably because their plastic heads are more unrealistic than the cheesiest of the 50s monster films . The birth sequence is a direct rip-off of Alien , but nowhere near as effective . If you really want to see a monster film , find another . This one is terrible .
" Gamera is the friend of all children ! "	When the Earth is threatened by an aquatic , shark-looking alien named Zigra ( and conveniently from the planet Zigra ) , it's up to Gamera ( and two very annoying Japanese children ) to save all of mankind . Gamera vs . Zigra is the bottom of the barrel when if comes to Japanese monster movies . Everything that makes Gamera so inferior to Godzilla is here : the annoying children , the ridiculous Gamera theme song , the ineffective defense force taking its lead from a 6 year-old , a woman in a mini-skirt chasing kids through Sea World , Kenny ( Is there always a kid named " Kenny " in one of these movies ? ) , and the worst looking monsters put on film . I realize these movies were aimed at a much younger audience ( remember , " Gamera is the friend of all children ! " ) , but do they have to be so stupid ? I'm afraid my head might explode if I think about it too much . I could go on and on , but I'll limit this to two surreal moments that are so silly they almost defy description . First , with the entire planet facing the threat of being conquered by Zigra and Tokyo preparing for a magnitude 18 ( whatever that means ) earthquake , an argument over fish takes center stage for better than 5 minutes of the movie's runtime . The man responsible for feeding the dolphins at the Tokyo Sea World and the manager of a swanky hotel get into a heated argument with a fishmonger over a crate of fish . Mankind is on the verge of extinction and all these people seem to be worried about is fish . As I indicated , I really can't do it justice . You'd have to see it to believe it . Second , having just defeated Zigra ( not really a spoiler ? did you think Gamera was going to lose ? ) , Gamera uses Zigra like a xylophone to pound out a tune . Yes , that's right ? Gamera uses a club on Zigra's dorsal fin to play the first few notes of his theme song . And if that weren't ridiculous enough , Gamera follows it up with a few dance steps . This is surely one of the proudest moments in Japanese film history . See what I mean ? My head hurts just thinking about it .
The Ridiculous She-Monster	- The Astounding She-Monster is a creature from outer space who has come to Earth to check things out . I'm not sure what makes her so astounding and she's about the least frightening monster I've seen . Let ' see , she has blond hair , wears a spandex bodysuit , and has some of the funkiest eyebrows I've ever seen . Oh , and there's that whole thing about how she can kill with her touch . But I'm not sure how anyone is stupid enough to let her get close enough . She does this walk like she's modeling and about as fast as a snail . - Ed Wood was an uncredited adviser on this movie - and it shows . Dialogue and special effects are straight from the Ed Wood school of movie making . Oh , and what dialogue it is . Characters with little or no scientific training babble on and on about theories involving space travel and radium poisoning . Once the She-Monster is dead , you would expect the remaining characters to seek help or just get out of there . But no , this couple stands around to trade scientific lectures . - A better name for the movie might be The Ridiculous She-Monster .
" You look like a pooped out pinwheel . "	Why do I do this to myself ? I know that there are those who have seen Robot Monster more times than I have , but when you loath a movie as much as I do this one , why would you watch it three times ? Yes , that's right ? I think Robot Monster is one of the absolute worst movies ever made with virtually no entertainment or other value , yet I've sat through it on three different occasions . I've tried watching it as a " serious " piece of sci-fi ? that obviously won't work . I've tried watching it through the eyes of a child ( as someone suggested ) ? sorry , that didn't work either . I've even tried watching it as a piece of unintentional comedy ? too boring for that . It makes for one of the worst MST3K episodes I've so far seen . I must have some sort of problem if I keep revisiting trash like this . I've noticed that many people go straight for the monster design when discussing Robot Monster . But Ro-Man , as he's known in the movie , is the least of the problems I have with the film . In fact , the image of the gorilla with the diving helmet is the only thing that keeps me from rating the movie lower . Whether intentional or some happy accident , the creature design is iconic . Many people who have never seen the movie or even know what movie it comes from have seen pictures of Ro-Man . Instead , my problems with the movie include every other factor you could think of . The acting is abysmal . Imagine my surprise when I noticed on IMDb that most of the cast actually had extensive acting backgrounds that just happened to include Robot Monster . Did they get on set and suddenly forget everything they knew about acting ? The music for Robot Monster was written early in his career by the famed composer Elmer Bernstein . I'm sure this is a proud entry on his resume . The opening music is mind-numbingly bad . Finally , the direction is terrible . The movie has no pace or flow . It's about as exciting as watching grass grow . As a cure for insomnia , Robot Monster might be a winner . But as a movie that provides entertainment on any level , Robot Monster is an unqualified disaster .
They should have let Shatner be Shatner	William Shatner is Rack Hansen , a small town veterinarian investigating the mysterious deaths of local farm animals . The State sends scientist Dian Ashley ( Tiffany Bolling ) to assist and the pair soon determine that thousands of aggressive tarantulas are invading the town . Kingdom of the Spiders has one of the best theme songs , Peaceful Verde Valley , I believe I've ever heard ( please note the sarcasm ) . With lyrics like this - " Will tomorrow bring the love we need - To last for evermore ? - Or could it bring the unknown - That we've never seen before ? " - how can you go wrong ? Actually , Kingdom of the Spiders could have been a lot of fun had the decision been made to let Shatner be Shatner . Instead of the over-acting Shatner we all know and have come to love , he's much more subdued here and it really hurts the movie . Kingdom of the Spiders might have been good for a laugh or two had Shatner been allowed to chew the scenery as he's so good at doing . As for the movie , it's pretty standard 70s Man Vs . Nature type stuff . No real surprises along the way and nothing to really stand out . A little more cheese would have really helped .
" You're much more attractive with your mouth shut ! "	I suppose I could go on and on about the many problems I have with this movie , but there's really no point . That dead horse has already been beaten . You can find page after page of comments on IMDb that describe in great detail the ridiculousness that is Space Mutiny . Instead , I want to focus on two areas that I feel deserve to be commented on . First , I've made it no secret that I've always enjoyed MST3K . For whatever reason , the show worked ( or works ) for me . Well , Space Mutiny joins the exalted company of something like Mitchell as one of the absolute best episodes of MST3K I've so far seen . Space Mutiny is such a mess that it's perfect for riffing . Whether it's the poor set design , the laughable continuity , Cameron Mitchell's ridiculous beard , the ludicrous dialogue , John Phillip Law's over-the-top maniacal ( but often misplaced ) laugh , the golf cart chase , or anything else in the movie , it's almost as if Space Mutiny was made with the concept of MST3K in mind . It just might be the perfect MST3K target . Second , as a huge fan of Cameron Mitchell , it pains me to see what he was reduced to appearing in at this stage of his career . The fake beard , the satin robes , and the painful dialogue are not the way I want to remember him . It's a long way from Blood and Black Lace , The House of Bamboo , How to Marry a Millionaire , or even The Toolbox Murders . I can't help but be reminded of something similar I wrote after watching the great Myrna Loy in It Happened at Lakewood Manner ? Cameron Mitchell certainly deserves better than this " monkey-turd of a movie " .
Morricone's score almost makes the movie worthwhile	In the past few weeks , I've watched a number of movies with Amazon-style man-hating tribes who only seek the company of men for the purposes of procreation . In this one , the Amazons are wiped out by a band of men . Wiped out , that is , except for a hunter / warrior named Hundra ( Laurene Landon ) who vows to get even for the slaughter of her sisters . It's also up to Hundra to repopulate her tribe if it is to survive . But to do so , Hundra will need the help of the very same men she seeks for revenge . Based on my rating , it should be obvious that I have some real problems with Hundra . Tops on that list would be the film's terribly mixed message . The movie tries to incorporate a lot of pseudo-feminist mumbo-jumbo into its plot with little success . It's all for show . You see the film is terribly hypocritical . On the one hand , the film seems to be trying to explore the empowerment of women - but at the same time the film exploits the very same women it purports to empower . The filmmakers seem to be trying to have their cake and eat it to ( Is that cliché enough for ya ? ) . Getting past the film's mixed message , Hundra is , for the most part , a poorly made , badly paced , and horribly acting movie . You would think that a plot involving this much bloodshed and sex would hold a little more interest . I , however , found myself nodding off several times throughout the movie . Dull and uninteresting doesn't begin to describe it . The version I saw clocked in at about 1 : 45 ? or about 30 minutes longer than it should have . As for the film's lead Laurene Landon , she's honestly one of the worst actresses I've seen in a while . Her delivery is so unnatural that it's distracting . Finally , the fight choreography is abysmal . Between Landon's unconvincing movements and the lack of any creativity in the fights , these scenes seem to drag on forever . And it doesn't help that the longest fight during Hundra's climax was shown in slow-motion . Before I end this , I feel I should mention one very obvious highlight of Hundra ? Ennio Morricone's score . It far exceeds anything else in the movie . It might not be Morricone's best , but it's certainly memorable . There's one particular piece of music played during the film's final fight scene that almost makes the movie worthwhile . It's that good .
" No rats , not allowed ! "	A space capsule is destroyed upon re-entry to the Earth's atmosphere sending a shower of wreckage across a Southern California beach . A teenager finds the astronaut's dismembered arm and ( inexplicably ) takes it home . How could he possibly know that the arm is possessed by a killer force or that he too will come under its influence ? I've watched a lot of really bad movies lately , but The Crawling Hand is far from the worst . In fact , it's almost " good " in comparison with dreck like Monster A Go-Go and The Starfighters ( yes , I've been on something of a MST3K binge lately ) . The movie has its share of problems ( hit and miss acting , obvious budgetary constraints , a ridiculous premise , etc . ) , but there are some nice moments mixed in here and there . Chief among them is the scene in the malt shop when the owner is attacked . The action , lighting , sound , and cinematography found in this scene far exceed anything you might expect to see in a movie with the reputation of The Crawling Hand . The two biggest problems I have with the movie seem to rarely get mentioned ? the shift from the hand of the movie's title to " teen angst " movie and the amount of padding used to extend the film's runtime . So while I may never think of The Crawling Hand as a masterpiece , I certainly see it in a better light than the majority of comments I've read . As The Crawling Hand is from the first season of MST3K , it suffers from the same lack of consistent riffing that plagues most of the early episodes . But in comparison with the other first season episodes I have seen , it's among the best . There is a bit involving a telephone that is very funny . Overall , I'll give this episode of MST3K a very generous ? a wishy-washy average rating .
Lifeless	To say that I was disappointed with Torino violenta ( I prefer that name to the American title ? Double Game ) would be an extreme understatement . To begin with , the movie is dull . It lacks the good action sequences , gunfights , and car chases that make so many of the other Italian cop / crime films entertaining . What action scenes the film does have pale in comparison with those from films like Almost Human , Revolver , or Syndicate Sadists . On top of that , the actors appear to be as bored with the film as I was . You can generally count on George Hilton to give an interesting performance regardless of the material . Here , he appears to be sleepwalking through the whole movie . He looks as if he expended as little energy as possible while making Torino violenta . Next , Torino violenta has no real plot . The first half of the film consists of a series of seemingly unrelated small-time crime scenes . It's not until the second half of the film that the plot finally reveals itself . But by then , it's too little , too late . Too little because the plot lacks any real substance and only serves to provide a stage for more of the same . Too late because by this point , I don't think I could have cared less . There's a whole subplot about George Hilton's character acting as a vigilante , working outside of the law . The problem is that this subplot goes nowhere and is only brought up when convenient . Finally , both the dubbing and subtitles are horrendous . I normally don't complain about this kind of thing , but this is the worst I've seen . The dubbing and subtitles match neither each other nor the action on screen . I had to watch the film with both so I could try to decipher what was going on . Looking over what I've written , I may need to revisit that I gave Torino violenta . A would seem to be more appropriate . NoShame's DVD is another example of a technically sound presentation and transfer . The problems I mentioned with the dubbing and subtitles have nothing to do with NoShame . These issues , no doubt , can be traced back to the source material that NoShame was give to work with . Even though I'm disappointed with the film , as usual , I'm impressed with NoShame .
Despite its many flaws , I found it oddly entertaining	Even though The Human Duplicators isn't a very good movie ( it registers far too high on the boredom scale ) there's something oddly entertaining about the whole thing that keep me from rating it a bomb as so many others . It's a crazy mix of 60s sci-fi and spy movies . The plot involves an alien named Kolos ( Richard Kiel ) who comes to earth to prepare the planet for a takeover . His plan involves kidnapping the Earth's most learned scientists and replacing them with duplicates under his control . Agent Glenn Martin ( George Nader ) is sent in to investigate the disappearance of the scientists and get to the bottom of things . Complicating matters is a blind girl ( Dolores Faith ) who Kolos finds himself strangely attracted to . Like I said , The Human Duplicators is not a good movie . It's actually quite bad . In all reality , the 2 . 3 IMDb rating is probably much more accurate than the I've rated it . But I was entertained despite the movie's many problems . It might have been a case of " so bad it's good " ( God , do I hate that expression ) . A secret agent with a blond floozy of an assistant , a giant alien in love with a petite blind girl , human replicants that shatter like terra cotta , a Medieval looking dungeon in Southern California , a roadside motel that doubles for a secret military establishment ? it's all so bizarre !
Can you have too much Sponge Bob ?	I've always enjoyed watching Sponge Bob when I get a chance . I wouldn't say that I've ever gone out of my way to catch an episode , but if it's on and I don't have anything else to do , I'll watch . But there is a limit to how much Sponge Bob I can endure at any one time . Trying to stretch Sponge Bob into a feature length movie just doesn't work all that well . Sure , there are a few gags here and there that are funny , but the underlying plot holding the thing together isn't involving . It goes on far too long . I realize that I'm probably not in Sponge Bob's target audience , but it didn't work for my son either . After 45 minutes or so , he was ready to turn it off as well . He left the room and I watched the final part of the movie alone , in silence , without caring much about what happened .
I expected a bit more from a movie with Brigitte Bardot and Anthony Perkins .	I expected a bit more from a movie with Brigitte Bardot and Anthony Perkins . They're both okay , but they just don't have much to do . The script lets them down at every opportunity . The Ravishing Idiot ( or Agent 38-24-36 ) is the story of a bumbling spy played by Perkins . He enlists the aid of a dipsy Bardot to help him steal some secret plans . The comedy is , for the most part , lame . There are moments I enjoyed , but these scenes were too few and too far between . Anytime you rely on speeding up the film so the actors will move fast as a basis for comedy , you're in trouble . And The Ravishing Idiot uses this type of trick far too often . The Ravishing Idiot isn't the total waste of time I've made it out to be . There are a few scenes that were quite funny . The bit where Bardot and Perkins lose the plans over and over at the party was actually quite good . Also , it's interesting to see Perkins doing a film in French . I'm no expert , but I thought he did a good job .
Stop the Madness	- Normally , I start with a brief ( sometimes very brief ) outline of the plot . With Friday the 13th Part VII , there's really no point in doing that . A group of young people is staying in a cabin on Crystal Lake . They have sex , smoke dope , and act incredibly stupid . Gee , I wonder what's going to happen to them ? Imagine my surprise when Jason shows up and starts butchering everyone in sight . - I'll give the movie credit for trying to throw a new wrinkle into the Friday the 13th story . One of the people staying on the lake is a young girl with telekinetic powers . Think of it as Carrie vs . Jason . She actually proves to be one of the more equally matched foes Jason has faced and the highlight of the movie for me . - While not the lowest point in the Friday the 13th series , Part VII comes close . The biggest problem with the movie is the total lack of suspense . By the time Part VII came out , anyone with a pulse was already familiar with the basic premise . And even though Telekenetic Girl is present , the movie doesn't stray from the tried and true formula . We know Jason is going to show up and kill people . What kind of suspense is that ? It doesn't help that we know absolutely nothing about most of the victims . I realize that the majority of Jason's victims are little more than cardboard cut-outs , but here they're even less than that . It's hard to have suspense when you don't really give a damn or know anything about the people in danger .
The presence of Bardot and Connery should have been enough to ensure a winner .	What a shame ! Shalako could have been so good . Two of the biggest stars in films at the time and a unique , fairly entertaining story should have made for a good movie . Instead , Shalako turns into a dull Western with too many traditional stereotypes , actors who give among the worst performances of their careers that I've seen , and an ending that will leave you scratching your head . The whole notion of a hunting party full of European aristocrats in the American Southwest is intriguing . Unfortunately , other than the odd dinner scene , nothing is made of this opportunity to present a different look at the West . Instead , Edward Dmytryk takes every opportunity possible to fill the plot with " good white people " and " bad Indians " . We've seen it before at least a million times . These are the same old stereotypes that had been around since the beginning of movies . The presence of Brigitte Bardot and Sean Connery should have been enough to ensure a winner . Both , however , appear terribly miscast and uninterested in what's going on . And then there's that ending . What a mess ! If a little fistfight was all it took to get the " bad Indians " off the trail of the " good white people " , why not have it out at the beginning of the movie and be done with it . Shalako features over an hour long build up to one of the more disappointing endings I've seen . It's not that the whole thing is a complete disaster . There are moments where Shalako really shines . The dinner scene I mentioned is a surreal moment that's very pleasing . Honor Blackman's death scene is another standout moment . And , watching the butler shine silver in the middle of the desert is something you don't ' see everyday . But these scenes are too few and far between to save Shalako .
A memorable cast , but that's about it	I recently finished watching " The Hardy Boys / Nancy Drew Mysteries " Season 1 DVD set and boy oh boy did it bring back memories . This particular episode may not have been the best , but it's one of the more memorable from the first season . The fact that it's memorable has nothing to do with the actual plot ( it happens to be one of the weakest of the bunch ) , but instead , it's memorable for the cast . A pre-Halloween Jamie Lee Curtis and a pre-Nightmare on Elm Street Robert Englund have supporting roles . From what I could tell , there's not much here to suggest the pair would go on and have the careers they've had . As for the episode itself , a wealthy couple hires a traveling carnival to help them put on a charity benefit . During the night , someone breaks into a safe and makes off with a fortune in jewelry . The carnival workers are immediately suspected . Nancy tags along to their next gig and , posing as a runaway , gets a job so she can investigate from the inside . As I said , it's one of the weakest episodes form Season 1 . It's far fetched and features some of the lamest motorcycle action sequences put on tape . The series generally works better when the plots deal with ghosts and other mysterious happenings .
Are you left-handed ?	- Younger people may find it hard to believe , but there was a time when horror fans actually looked forward to movies like Moon of the Wolf . Before cable / satellite television and home video libraries , fans were at the mercy of the three major networks to satisfy some of their craving for horror movies . The networks would occasionally oblige the horror fan with made-for-television movies . When one of these movies appeared in the TV lineup , I couldn't wait . Titles like Satan's School for Girls , The Night Stalker , Death at Love House , and Bad Ronald have become fond childhood memories . I somehow missed Moon of the Wolf when it was originally aired , but I didn't miss much . - The story begins with the discovery of a woman's body in a swamp . Because of the way her body was ravaged , the townsfolk immediately put the blame for her death on " wild dogs " . But the local doctor doesn't see it that way . He notes a human element present in the woman's death . As the sheriff begins his investigation , more people die brutal deaths . An old man in the swamp insists that the deaths are caused by a " loup-garou " . But that seems like nonsense to the sheriff . Surely there's not a werewolf loose in the swamp . - As far as 70s made-for-television horror goes , Moon of the Wolf is far from the best . Too much of the movie plays like a soap opera . You've got : the dead girl's mysterious pregnancy , the rich man in town who treats it and the people who live there like his personal fiefdom , the budding romance between the sheriff and the rich man's sister who has returned to town under a cloud of uncertainty , and the drugs the dead girl was stealing from the hospital . It's all too corny and does nothing to help the horror aspects of the film . By the time the werewolf shows up ( the final 10 minutes ) , it's too late . - The movie attempts to make a big mystery out of who the werewolf is . The sheriff quickly comes up with three possible suspects , but as a fan of horror , if you can't spot the real killer , you need to have your horror card taken from you . The answer to the mystery literally beats you over the head . The sheriff also has a very unique way of trying to uncover the truth . Instead of long , drawn-out interrogations , the sheriff's entire investigation consists of asking almost everybody in town , " Are you left-handed ? " because the doctor has told him that the killer may ( or may not ) be left-handed . What amazing police work ! I'm surprised CSI hasn't ' picked-up on this method of crime solving . - You may be asking yourself if the movie is as bad and silly as I've described , why haven't I rated it any lower ? Well , I can't help myself . It's a nostalgia thing with me . I grew up with these movies and still enjoy them no matter how bad they are . I'm a sucker for this stuff .
The Uber-Cool Telly Savalas	Scenes from a Murder is a fairly rare giallo that I felt fortunate to have found in a used video store . The movie stars the uber-cool Telly Savalas as a stalker . The woman he's after has amnesia and has trouble remembering simple things like where she lives or that her lover died five years previous . For whatever reason , her family and friends allow her to wander aimlessly around the city . For the first of the movie , that's pretty much all we get ? a woman with amnesia stumbling around the city with the every present Savalas close behind . It's not very exciting and not very entertaining . It's not until the final third that anything really happens . The scenes of Savalas close on the woman's heels through an abandoned sound stage are effective but account for far too little of the movie . These scenes and the final revelation keep this from being a completely wasted experience .
Even with Barbara Bouchet and Rosalba Neri , it's surprisingly average	Given that Amuck features two of my Euro-favorites , Barbara Bouchet and Rosalba Neri , it's a surprisingly average giallo . Bouchet is a young secretary working for a publishing house . She becomes concerned when her friend and fellow co-worker goes missing . She gets assigned to the same writer ( played by the dull Farley Granger ) to investigate her friend's disappearance . She immediately suspects the writer and his lover , Neri , and must endure their sexual advances if she is to find her friend . For a film of this type to be effective , I've found that it's important to believe the protagonist is in real danger . You have to believe that their investigations might lead to their death . Other than the duck hunting scene in Amuck , I never once felt that Bouchet's character was in any real sort of mortal peril . While there was a real chance she was going to be drugged and forced to have sex , I knew she wasn't going to die . Add to this the fact that the solution to the murder is laid out in the first 30 minutes and you've got no real tension or suspense .
And I had such high hopes for this one	A deranged serial killer wants to play a game of internet poker with the police . But the stakes are very high . If the police win , the woman he has kidnapped goes free . If the killer wins , the captive dies . It's up to an Italian policewoman and an Irish agent to stop this high-tech killer before anymore young women die . What Works : - Set pieces . I have seen even the most ardent Argento critics admit that the worst of his movies have some nice set pieces . Argento's problem has always been stringing these set pieces together into a coherent story . While I could cite several examples , one set piece in The Card Player that really stands out is the scene where the killer is hiding in the policewoman's house . It's suspenseful and very nicely done . - Nasty deaths . Although most of the actual scenes of murder take place off screen , we are treated to the nasty aftermath . The scenes of the police poking the murdered bodies in the morgue are as gruesome as you'll see . Especially when one of the bodies " fights " back . Eeeewwww . - Acting . The two leads ( Stefania Rocca and Liam Cunningham ) are excellent . Both came across as believable and sometimes that's all you need . Plus , the chemistry between the two was very good . I could actually see the two of them together as a couple . It wasn't forced as is so often the case . What Doesn't Work : - Contrived Plot . Too often , The Card Player relies on the most unrealistic coincidences to advance the plot . It's as if the planets line-up just right for the killer to do and get away with the things he does . For example , in one scene , the killer uses a woman to lure a poker expert into a trap . The problem is that the man must follow the woman over what seems like half of Italy until he arrives at just the right spot before the killer springs into action . How does the killer know the poker guy will follow the woman that far ? What if he tires of the chase and calls it quits ? What if he meets another woman and goes with her ? It felt too contrived to me to be believable . - Acting . As good as the two leads are , much of the rest of the cast is terrible . I don't know if it's more a function of poor dubbing than it is actual acting ability , but the supporting cast doesn't come across very well . Some of the police captain's top assistants are about as convincing as the Three Stooges ( not to mention they come across like the Three Stooges ) . - The Poker Expert . The police captain's daughter has been kidnapped and could very well be the next victim . The police desperately need a poker expert to increase their odds of winning the game of online poker . Do they turn to a well-known , renowned poker player ? Do they turn to a mathematician to assist in determining probabilities in poker ? Heck , do they even seek out an someone with half a brain ? The answer : No ! Instead , the police put the fate of the kidnapped women in the hands of a brainless punk who plays video poker for pocket change . Argento's The Card Player is a real hit or miss proposal . While Argento again shows his skill with set pieces and is blessed with some good acting , there are too many plot points that don't make much sense or are too far-fetched for me to rate The Card Player any higher .
" There is no more deadly or voracious creature than the Preying Mantis . "	The Deadly Mantis is another of the big bug sci-fi movies that the studios were putting out in the 1950s . While these movies have a lot in common , not all big bug movies were created equally . Even though The Deadly Mantis does have a point or two in its favor ( special effects , etc . ) , overall it's just not as good as similar movies . One problem is the lack of originality . The Deadly Mantis comes toward the end of big bug cycle . The better movies of this type had already been made . When you consider the number of other big animal movies that were made in the 1950s , it's little wonder why The Deadly Mantis doesn't feel very original . It's the same tired plot line that was pulled out and used over and over ? a giant mantis destroys a few buildings , kills a few helpless citizens , and generally terrorizes a populace . If you were to substitute the mantis for the tarantula and the Arctic for the desert , The Deadly Mantis and Tarantula become very similar movies . Another real problem is the first 15 or so minutes of the movie . It's pure , Grade-A , unadulterated U . S . government propaganda . I've read that the U . S . wanted to make sure that the Soviets knew that the country's northern border with Canada was more than adequately protected against a surprise attack across the North Pole . So for what seems to be a good portion of the movie , we're treated to maps of Canada's northern most territory , a voice droning on about the hard work of building and maintaining the radar stations , and a variety of stock footage . While it's reasonably interesting in that 50s Red Scare sort of way , it does nothing for the movie . So , if you really want to see a big bug movie from the 50s , check out either Them ! or Tarantula . While The Deadly Mantis certainly isn't the worst movie you'll ever see , there are much better examples of this genre available to be watched .
" Winter's coming in and the wolves coming with it . "	By no stretch of the imagination is this even close to Price's best film . In most of his films , Price can play the most evil , vile , hideous person alive , yet you can still find qualities to like because of his charismatic , sympathetic nature . This is not the case in Cry of the Banshee . Price's Lord Edward Whitman is a character without any likable qualities . I don't think the story ( very similar to The Conqueror Worm ) was very original for its time . There are far better " burn the witch " movies that preceded Cry of the Banshee . Price again plays a witch finder . But , he messes with the wrong witch and she places a curse on his family . One by one , family members die at the hands of the witch's Banshee . Two things I liked were the ending and the Banshee make-up . The end of the film had some mild surprises that I enjoyed . And the Banshee makeup was good , IMO , because it wasn't over-done . The minimalistic approach to the make-up worked for me .
It's got style to burn !	Moon Zero Two features two seemingly unrelated plot threads with Capt . William H . Kemp ( James Olson ) as their only connection . In the first , a distraught woman is looking for her brother , a miner on the far side of the moon . She enlists Capt . Kemp to help her by taking her to the brother's claim site . In the second , a very wealthy individual hires Capt . Kemp to help him catch an asteroid and bring it crashing to the moon's surface . The asteroid is actually a giant sapphire . It's near the end of the movie before Capt . Kemp is able to put the two pieces of the plot together , discover the brother's fate , and make a decision on helping with the sapphire plan . What Works : - Acting : Overall , the acting in Moon Zero Two is a step above what I expected . But then again most Hammer films , regardless of any other shortcomings , generally featured above average acting . I was especially impressed by Catherine Schell and Warren Mitchell . - Style : A lot of people knock it , but Moon Zero Two has more style going for it than a runway in Paris . If you liked the retro look of something like Austin Powers , you'll see the real thing in this movie . From the go-go dancers and their mod outfits to the far-out bar furnishing , the movie's got style to burn . I suppose the best example is the outfit worn by Catherine Schell when she makes her first screen appearance . Words cannot do it justice ? suffice it to say that it is the epitome of 60s style . - The narrative : As I've already indicated , Moon Zero Two features two seemingly unrelated plot threads that are brought together only near the film's end . While I watched the movie , I realized the plot would come together , but I never once guessed correctly how this was going to be pulled off . It's a clever bit of screen writing . What Didn't Work : - James Olson : It's not that Olson is particularly bad in Moon Zero Two , but he lacks the qualities normally associated with the lead in a movie . He's just not a very interesting actor ( a nice way to say " He's boring " ) . Someone with a little more pizazz would have been preferable . - Pacing : The biggest single problem I had with Moon Zero Two is the movie's tendency to bog down and go nowhere for extended periods of time . There are great stretches of the film where nothing interesting at all is going on . A little tighter editing might have been a judicious choice . - Music : I don't remember the last time I found a film score as annoying as the one in Moon Zero Two . I suppose it could be called freestyle jazz or something like that , but to me , it was just plain headache inducing . And it all seemed so inappropriate given the action on screen . For example , the two main characters might be riding across the moon's surface when out of nowhere the audience is treated to a random trumpet blast . Annoying ! Overall , while there's much I did enjoy about Moon Zero Two , there's an equal amount that bothered me . But in this case , the " fun " factor wins out and I'll give it a . The copy of Moon Zero Two I have was aired as part of Mystery Science Theater 3000 . This was a first season episode and it suffers like a lot of the early episodes from inconsistent riffing from the guys at MST3K . Some of the jokes are funny , but there's either not enough of them or they miss their mark . Either way , I found myself wanting to turn down the comedy track to pay attention to the movie . I'll rate Episode # 111 a on my MST3K rating scale .
Jonny goes to the North Pole	A rocket headed for space goes off-course and crashes in the Arctic . The rocket was armed with an auto-destruct mechanism , but it mysteriously failed to activate . Dr . Quest and family are sent in to investigate and retrieve the valuable scientific instruments on board the craft . But Quest and Company aren't alone . There's a foreign power prowling beneath the Arctic ice flow who will stop at nothing to get their hands on the rocket's many secrets . " Arctic Splashdown " proves that not all episodes of Jonny Quest were created equally . To the best of my memory , this has to be one of the weakest of the bunch . The problem is nothing much happens and there's no air of menace so often present in the show . The episode features one of the lamest baddies the Quest gang would run across . After firing a torpedo at Quest's ship and hitting an ice berg instead ( Am I supposed to believe he didn't see that giant floating block of ice ? ) , # 1 baddie decides not to fire again , but wait for later . Huh ? How stupid is that ? " Arctic Splashdown " isn't a total waste as it does feature some pretty cool gadgets like the ice skiffs ( I think that's what they're called ) , that groovy Jonny Quest music , and that overall sense of nostalgia that I always get when watching Jonny Quest . A seems about right for this episode .
I can't believe I'm saying this , but more Joan would have also been a plus for the film .	Maurizio Merli plays a small-time private detective hired to find a missing girl . His hunt leads him to Austria and the case of a dead girl that he's sure is connected to the girl he's looking for . He learns that the girls were involved with a gang dealing in child prostitution . Merli has to get act fast if he's to save the life of the girl he's looking for . The more I see of Maurizio Merli , the more I enjoy his performances . After my first experiences with him , I saw Merli as little more than a pretty-boy , Franco Nero wannabe . But recently , I've begun to see he's got a lot to offer of his own . He's as good in the action scenes as Nero and probably better at the more comedic moments . He shows both in Fatal Charm . Whether it's taking out the bad guys or pulling a scam on the local police , he's got real screen presence and a definite charm . Fatal Charm ( aka Fearless , aka Poliziotto senza paura , aka Magnum Cop ) could have been so much better had the plot not been so muddled and confusing . Part of it may be due to the dubbing , but the film definitely goes off in tangents that would have been best left alone . It seems to take forever for Merli to get to the bottom of things . For example , there's a whole series of scenes with Merli playing up his operations to an Austrian detective . It's pointless and doesn't really work . A tighter script would have served Fatal Charm well . My copy of Fatal Charm gives top billing to Joan Collins . And while her scenes are memorable ( she gets naked for God's sake ) , she only has about 15 minutes of screen time . I can't believe I'm saying this , but more Joan would have also been a plus for the film .
Calling it " Average " is about the best I can do	For whatever reason , I tend to be drawn to these backwoods , hillbilly horror films like a moth to a flame . I can't get enough of them . In this particular sub-genre , I would call Just Before Dawn average . It's not the best I've seen , but it's far from being as bad as something like Midnight ( 1982 ) . In general , I think these films appeal to me because of their realism . Monsters , ghosts , and other supernatural elements are fine , but even the most basic and mundane of these films ask the viewer to stretch their imagination to some degree . In contrast , we've all heard stories about the crazy inbred mountain people and their distrust of modern society . And while films like Just Before Dawn may take liberties with the extreme violence , there's no denying the real stories of actual murders as a result of this culture clash . In Just Before Dawn , a group of twenty-somethings makes there way to a remote mountain for a little fun and relaxation . They are warned twice , once by the Forest Ranger and again by a crazed man in the woods , to turn back . Ignoring the warnings , they set up camp and prepare to enjoy themselves . But these woods are home to more than the normal forest creatures . There's a killer on the loose and the group of young adults soon become the target . Sound familiar ? This plot description could be applied to about a dozen films I can think of off the top of my head . It's that original . I look at Just Before Dawn as a case of missed opportunities . There were places the movie could have gone to break away from the standard 80s backwoods , hillbilly horror mold and done something unique . For example , more information on the mountain family and what makes them tick would have been very interesting . Or , more explanation on the killers and how they lived and their motives would have been very interesting . Or , including the subplot involving mountain religions ( as suggested in the interview on the DVD ) would have been very interesting . But as it is , every opportunity to do something other than have a group of young people stalked through the woods by an unseen , silent assassin is missed . To be fair , I'll give the movie some credit in a couple of instances . First , I thought it was a nice touch to keep the characters " real " . What I mean is that too often in these movies , characters are little more than overdone stereotypes . The characters in Just Before Dawn aren't much different from people I've known . Second , there are a couple of very well done camera shots . For example , the scene of the killer walking through the waterfall in the background as two characters swim in the lake is very subtle and very effective . Third , a couple of the kill scenes rise above what I associate with low-budget 80s horror . The killing of the hunter at the beginning of the movie is very nice . In the end , it's a shame that the makers of Just Before Dawn didn't take more chances . Had they been willing to push the envelope a bit more , this movie might have been one of the better examples of this sub-genre instead of being merely average .
Can you say " sleaze " ?	- It will be difficult , but I'll try to keep the plot description as brief as possible . The movie opens with shots of a tiger shark . Next we see our main character , Steve , who meets and has sex with Patricia . Patricia leaves Steve for Miguel . Steve gets into a fight with Miguel that only serves to push Patricia and Miguel closer . After a night of sex with Miguel , a tiger shark kills Patricia . More scenes of a tiger shark . Miguel and Steve become friends and meet two girls , Kelly and Cynthia . They have sex with the girls . One night the girls decide to have a party on Steve's boat . Steve becomes furious and kicks them off the boat . Oh , I think I saw a tiger shark ! Next , Steve and Miguel meet Gabriella . Soon , Steve , Miguel , and Gabriella are living together , playing together , and having sex together . Gabriella buys three wedding rings and the group becomes unofficially married . A tiger shark kills Miguel and Gabriella leaves because their threesome has come to an end . Cue the scenes of the tiger shark . Steve now meets Girl from the Bar # 1 and # 2 . They go to a party where Steve trades them for his old lovers , Kelly and Cynthia . Everyone decides to get naked and swim to Steve's boat . Cynthia and Girl from the Bar # 2 don't make it . Can you say " tiger shark " ? Finally , Steve battles the tiger shark for 3 or 4 minutes . The End . ( Okay , so that wasn't very brief . ) - Tintorera is a nice example of trash cinema at its finest . It's one of the sleaziest movies I've seen . It's hard to watch Tintorera and not feel dirty . I don't care how it's listed on IMDb , Tintorera is really soft-core porn with a few scenes of a tiger shark thrown in so it could be marketed as horror movie and a Jaws rip-off . Throughout most of the movie we're treated to scene after scene of people in little or no clothing , both male and female , drinking , smoking , and having sex . When they aren't busy doing this , Miguel and Steve enjoy lounging around in their Speedos drinking , smoking , and discussing having sex . In fact , and I'm not exaggerating , Miguel's naked butt has more screen time than the tiger shark . These people are so busy porking one another that it takes them forever to realize that their friends are being killed . And , as the scenes of the tiger shark are so infrequent , I almost forgot about it too . - When we do see the tiger shark ripping people apart , it's surprisingly well done . I would go so far as to say that it surpasses even Jaws in the gory depiction of a shark attack . The sight of a tiger shark swimming with Miguel's head in it's mouth is as horrific as anything in most any other shark movie I've seen . And it's not just the sharks doing the killing . The animal killing in Tintorera is more plentiful than in a lot of the other , better known , exploitation movies of the 70s . In their spare time , Miguel and Steve enjoy shooting sharks in the head and spearing barracudas . The movie shows literally dozens of sharks , turtles , and assorted fish being killed . It's really nasty stuff . - Finally , a word about the rating I've given Tintorera . I'll admit that it's really not a very good movie . But , I couldn't bring myself to rate it any lower because it kept me interested and amused throughout . It's a lot like a car wreck ? it's difficult to look away . - Okay , I'm going to go take a bath .
Lee Marvin , Gene Hackman , and no plot	The best thing about Prime Cut is the chance to see both Lee Marvin and Gene Hackman . Marvin is the understated bad-ass we've seen before and Gene Hackman is the greasy bad guy we've seen before . If you like these two in familiar roles that don't require them to stretch their acting abilities , Prime Cut is for you . There are some good action sequences ( especially the scene in the wheat field ) , but it's the two stars that make this one worthwhile . The plot certainly isn't the attraction . In fact , the plot is the weakest part of the movie . Why ? Because there is no plot . Instead , Prime Cut is a series of action sequences strung together with a bare minimum of story . When the movie ended , I had more questions than when it began . What's the history between Marvin and Hackman ? What is the relationship between Marvin and Hackman's wife ? Does anyone in the movie have a backstory ? Are the Kansas City area police completely oblivious to everything going on around them ? Was that just some random fat guy on the combine trying to kill Marvin ? Do people in Kansas City really wear overalls with no shirt or shoes ? It's these burning questions that I wanted answers to .
An average way to begin an average series	" Escape from Tomorrow " is the first episode in the Planet of the Apes television series that aired in 1974 . As you might expect from a pilot episode , its main function is the quickly and effectively set-up the series and the episodes that follow . The basic plot of this episode - Alan Virdon ( Ron Harper ) and Pete Burke ( James Naughton ) are two astronauts who crash land on Earth some 1 , 000 years in the future . Centuries previous , man effectively destroyed his civilization allowing intelligent , talking apes to assume control . The pair of astronauts is imprisoned by apes for being a threat to their way of life and their system of beliefs . With the unintentional assistance of a sympathetic chimpanzee named Galen ( Roddy McDowell ) , the humans escape and begin running for their lives . Other than the initial series set-up and establishing who the characters are , there's really not much going on in this episode . Royal Dano is on hand in a small but thankless supporting role to provide Virdon and Burke some assistance and , more importantly , to provide exposition . Harper and Naughton actually play everything a little too constrained . I think if I discovered that I was marooned on a planet of talking apes , I would be a little more shocked and animated about the whole thing . Their reaction is a bit too laid-back . Fans of the movies will find several familiar scenes in this episode . There's the spaceship crash , the discovery by the humans of the talking apes , the meeting of the elders , the inevitable escape , and Roddy McDowell . Not a lot of creativity here , huh ? If you were to compress the movie into about 30 minutes , you've basically got the pilot episode .
Everything's great , except the plot	After her car breaks down , Jane Lindstrom ( Glynis Johns ) makes her way to the gated home of a man known as Caligari ( Dan O'Herlihy ) . She is invited into the house and , at first , feels comfortable . But when Jane is not allowed to leave the next day , she realizes that , like Caligari's other " guests " , she is trapped . Things get even worse when she witnesses Caligari and another man beating an old woman to death . She'll do anything to get out , but how does she ever hope to escape from Caligari's clutches ? This movie might have been a complete dude for me if it weren't for Glynis Johns . For lack of a better word , I'll call her portrayal of Jane Lindstrom " refreshing " . She's absolutely atypical of what you would normally expect to find in a movie like this . For the most part , she's meek , mild , mannered , and goes along with what she's told . But when push comes to shove , she's not above abandoning this persona and experimenting with a more brash , sexy personality if it will help her get what she desires . The contrast between the two personalities is fascinating . The rest of the cast is equally enjoyable with O'Herlihy playing the mysterious , cold Caligari perfectly . A group of recognizable character actors , whose names may not be very well known , rounds out the cast . Don't expect " in your face " horror with The Cabinet of Caligari . It's very subtle . In fact , my rating would be higher but the movie is often too subtle for its own good . There were more than a few instances where I wished something would happen . Too often the plot drags as we see scene after scene of Jane lying around bemoaning her situation . Do something , woman ! And while Caligari is a threatening presence , he spends most of his time sitting behind a desk asking seemingly pointless questions . But just when you think things have come to a grinding halt , a scene like the one where Caligari is caught by our heroine spying on her in the bathtub comes along and things pick up for a moment . Technically , The Cabinet of Caligari is superior to a lot of the other low budget horror of the period . Cinematography and lighting are quite nice . There are some interesting camera shots and lighting choices such as those during Jane's striptease for Caligari . The set design is a real highlight . I was reminded on more than one occasion of the post-modern / deco house in The Black Cat ( 1934 ) , a real favorite of mine . The house features fabulously designed staircases , corners , and spaces to make most scenes at least look interesting . Overall , it's too bad the plot couldn't be as interesting , entertaining , or well done as the technical aspects of the film and the acting . Had the plot been better , The Cabinet of Caligari could have been a real winner .
A little better than the first	- In this episode , Lara Croft is out for more than just another archaeological find . She's looking for The Cradle of Life - the place where all life on earth is rumored to have begun . It is also rumored that The Cradle of Life is the resting place of Pandora's Box . She's in a race with an evil genius who wants to use the box to destroy most of mankind . Can she find it first ? - It's amazing to me that someone was able to take the premise of a game that I spent hours enjoying and make two very mediocre movies . I've got the same problem with this movie that I did with the first . What happened to actually doing some tomb raiding ? I realize that these movies can't be exactly like the games ( PETA would have a fit if Lara was shown killing as many animals as she does in the games ) , but come on . The sense of adventure and the thrill of reaching the goal is completely lost in these movies . In its place , we have overblown special effects and stories that are utterly ridiculous . - The saving grace , as in the first film , is Angelina Jolie . I've never cared much for her , but she is the ultimate personification of Lara Croft . It's too bad the producers , directors , and writers couldn't fashion a good story for her .
An average Chan - and I'm being generous calling it that	I've been a Charlie Chan fan as long as I remember . Some of my earliest memories involve watching Chan late at night on television . But Charlie Chan in the Secret Service doesn't work for me the way most Chan films do . Sure , it has its moments ( like introducing Birmingham Brown ) , but there are too many problems I have with the movie for me to call it anything other than average . What are the problems with Charlie Chan in the Secret Service ? Glad you asked . Two areas where I have real issues with the movie are the means of murder and the padding . First , Charlie Chan in the Secret Service features a couple of fairly elaborate murder weapons that would have taken some time to set up . But the killer was just a guest in the house . So when did the murderer get inside and re-do the electrical wiring to be able to commit murder ? Second , Charlie Chan in the Secret Service has a runtime of only 63 minutes . But if you were to take out the numerous instances of padding , you might end up with a movie less than 45 minutes in length . The most egregious example is the scene where Chan leaves the Secret Service building . We see Chan walk down the hall , through the doorway , down the steps , wait for a cab , get in the cab , ride to his destination , exit the cab , and finally get inside the house . Alone , these scenes take a good two or more minutes and add absolutely nothing to the film other than stretching its runtime . I realize that most of the Monogram Chan films can't compare with what came before . But Charlie Chan in the Secret Service is weak even by Monogram standards .
What does it say about a movie when Joan Collins is one of the best things its got going for it .	Esther and the King may appear unusual if you take a look at the usual things I write about . But because Mario Bava was so heavily involved with the film , I just had to give it a go . While the visuals may not be as vivid and exaggerated as some of the films he had more control over , you can see his influences if you look closely . There are several scenes that demonstrate Bava's use of color . One very brief scene early in the film shows the palace guards turning a wheel to close the gates . This scene that lasts less than 10 seconds is lit in very dramatic style with a wash of green and red . It's trademark Bava . As for the film , I really didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did . Oh , it's not great by any stretch of the imagination . Esther and the King was part of the flood of Biblical epics that were made in the late 50s to early 60s . Actually , Esther and the King should be called a mini-epic . It's not as sprawling or grand as the big budgeted Hollywood epics . The sets look cheap in comparison and there are no great action sequences . The first half of the film drags by at a snails pace . The final thirty minutes do provide a little suspense and save Esther and the King from becoming a total waste of time . I'm not even going to discuss how well the film follows the Biblical story as that's a topic best covered elsewhere . I've never cared for Joan Collins , but here she's quite good . I found myself believing in her character and rooting her on . Another standout to me is Sergio Fantoni as the evil Haman . The man plays a bad guy to perfection . The rest of the cast is serviceable but not spectacular .
" Well , that's a novelty - - you're refusing anything with alcohol in it ! "	Dr . Paul Talbot is a scientist who learns of a drug that is supposed to not only retard the effects of aging , but reverse the process as well . With his wife , June , he sets out to make his fortune . In Africa , he finds the leathery old woman who told him about the drug and watches as she is turned into a beautiful young woman . The process requires the pollen of a specific orchid and the fluid from the human pineal gland . But extracting the fluid means death to the donor . When told she is to be the next beneficiary of the drug , Mrs . Talbot is allowed to choose the male who will give his life to make her young again . To get back at him for a life of torment , she selects her husband as the donor . June's youth is restored and her overbearing husband is dead . The problem , as Mrs . Talbot is about to discover , is that the effects of the procedure are only temporary . She'll have to go on killing if she is to remain young . It's not that The Leech Woman is a particularly bad movie ( in fact , there's a lot here I really enjoy ) , it's just that it's terribly predictable . I mean is anyone surprised that when on the verge of divorce , Paul insists that he and his wife reconcile and she go to Africa with him ? Quite naturally , he intends to use her as a human guinea pig and , if the process works , get a hot , young wife in return . His shallow intentions and desires are overly obvious . Or , was anyone surprised that June selected her husband as the donor who would die to give her back her youth ? It's an excellent moment , but I saw it coming from miles away . So even though I appreciate and enjoy much of the movie , The Leech Woman lacks any real surprises along the way . I realize that The Leech Woman was cranked out in a hurry and on a low budget to be used by Universal as B-picture , but a little more creativity and thought might have made it a real winner .
" If you ask me , we're just heading around in circles . "	One thing you'll notice if you watch only a handful of 1980s Italian genre films is the way they rip-off ? err ? I mean borrow from whatever the popular fad was at the time in American movies . Movies like Conan the Barbarian , Escape from New York , Dawn of the Dead , and The Road Warrior inspired countless Italian imitators . While few of these movies can be called " good " in a traditional sense , many are at least fun in their own weird and unique way . The Atlantis Interceptors is one such movie . Director Ruggero Deodato throws everything but the kitchen sink into The Atlantis Interceptors . Bits and pieces from movies as diverse as the previously mentioned Escape from New York to Raiders of the Lost Ark are used in the movie's nonsensical storyline . It's a mishmash of ideas with one set-piece after another strung together with the bare minimum of a plot thread . Some of it works and some of it fails miserably , yet it somehow comes out as an entertaining time waster at its worst . It's best to just turn your mind off and go with it . The plot ( at least what I could make out of it ) involves a group of scientists raising a derelict Russian nuclear submarine from the ocean floor . By doing so , however , they unwittingly bring Atlantis back to the surface as well . The Atlantians ( is that what you call them ) send forth an army of post-apocalyptic looking thugs to take over the surface world . A small group of survivors must band together , defeat the Atlantians , and save the world . That may be the plot , but The Atlantis Interceptors is really just one gun battle or car chase or explosion after another . I guess my biggest surprise came from the number of recognizable faces in the small cast . Ivan Rassimov , George Hilton , Christopher Connelly , and Gioia Scola will most certainly be familiar to fans of Italian genre films . I'm not sure how Deodato was able to assemble a cast like that , but it does add to the movie's appeal .
" You haven't heard Shakespeare until you've heard it in the original Klingon . "	In light of an upcoming peace conference between the Klingons and the Federation , Captain Kirk puts aside his personal feelings and welcomes a Klingon delegation to dine on the Enterprise . But soon after the Klingons return to their ship they are attacked and the Klingon Ambassador is assassinated by someone believed to be from the Enterprise . Kirk and McCoy are put on trial for the murder , found guilty , and sentenced to hard labor . Surely this can't be the end of Kirk and the rest of the Enterprise crew . I'm not even sure I can be fair to these Star Trek movies anymore . I'm finding it harder and harder to take them seriously . The situations , dialogue , and action are quite ridiculous . Add to that the incredible over-acting on the part of William Shatner and his hair-piece and you're left with something I find more comedic ( albeit unintentional ) than dramatic . For example , watching Kirk score with Iman or watching Kirk make goofy faces as he fights his double ? laugh out loud funny ! In reality , however , Star Trek VI : The Undiscovered Country is the best of the three Star Trek movies I've watched recently ( Generations and The Final Frontier being the other two ) . I actually had fun watching it . I attribute much of that to the direction . Is it a coincidence that without Shatner in the director's chair ( as he was in Star Trek V ) that much of the movie actually worked for me . Sure , the writing , etc . may have also been better , but I'll argue the direction was as well . The mystery elements of the story were nicely handled even though much of the solution was way too easy to guess . There's nothing quite like a good conspiracy to keep a movie interesting . Finally , it's difficult to watch Star Trek VI and not be impressed with the considerable talent of Christopher Plummer . He makes several of the Star Trek regulars look like chumps in comparison . His General Chang is one of the more interesting characters I've run into in a Star Trek movie .
Not quite the movie my son was hoping for	A family moves into the now empty house owned by an old , eccentric great aunt who has gone to live in a nearby sanitarium . While exploring the house , one of the boys finds a book that opens a world of magical creatures . Unfortunately for his family , though , an ogre named Mulgarath wants the book and the power it will give him . And he'll stop at nothing to get it . Let me say upfront that I've never read the books The Spiderwick Chronicles is based on . In fact , until recently , I had never even heard of The Spiderwick Chronicles . I say all this to show that I had no preconceived notions or expectations going into the movie . About the only thing I knew was that my 5 year-old son really wanted to go . Overall , while I enjoyed much of the movie , I did have a few problems that keep me from fully endorsing it . As for what worked , I'll start with the action . Much of the action in The Spiderwick Chronicles is the " edge of the seat " variety . The films finale with Mulgarath chasing the family around the house is exceptionally well done . In some of the other user comments I've written , I have slammed CG special effects . But here they are used marvelously . It's gotten so that it's difficult to tell where reality ends and the CG begins . The acting is another big highlight for me . Freddie Highmore , Mary-Louise Parker , and Sarah Bolger all give life and believability to their respective roles . Highmore , in particular , did an outstanding job of creating two distinct characters . Another bonus is that this is a family that actually looks like they could be related . It's a nice piece of casting . On to what didn't work . First , I'm not a big fan of the family dynamic presented in The Spiderwick Chronicles . When these people aren't being chased by monsters , they seem to spend their time yelling at each other . Why not have a family that gets along ? I believe that at least part of the reason I felt this way is that the movie feels incredibly rushed . I've read that five books were crammed into this one movie . It shows . There seemed to be little time for any character interaction that didn't move the plot along or set-up a scene later in the movie . Finally , the movie was much more frightening than I had expected it to be . It didn't bother me , but it scared my son to death . He won't even talk about the parts that didn't scare him ? and he's the reason we went . I'm no prude , but maybe this one should have been rated PG-13 . In the end , the good nudges out the bad and I'll rate The Spiderwick Chronicles a .
These guys are supposed to be Chinese ?	It'll never be on my " favorites " list , but Battle Beneath the Planet is not a half bad way to waste away an hour and a half or so . The movie is beyond silly , but that's what makes it fun and entertaining . The plot involves a Chinese General named Chan Lu ( Martin Benson ) who has a plan to destroy the United States from below . Using his boring machine , he and his renegade army have dug several large tunnels below the North American continent that they plan to use to launch a nuclear attack . Armed with his own borer , Cmdr . Jonathan Shaw ( Kerwin Mathews ) leads an American expeditionary force to investigate and stop General Lu in his tracks . Everything about this movie is utterly ridiculous . The plot , acting , and special effects are all ridiculous . The movie seems to have been made on a budget less than what a grande Starbucks might cost . I swear I saw our heroes go past the same stack of crates about a half a dozen times in their escape from the tunnels . And whose idea was it to use so many non-Asians in all the primary Chinese roles ? These people look about as Asian as I do ( which is not at all ) . Finally , the whole thing is shot in a style reminiscent of the 60s Batman television show with overly bright primary colors , poor and fake looking props , and weak staging in the action sequences . Still , it's all these factors that make the movie a blast . It might not work for everyone , but I enjoyed Battle Beneath the Earth . A seems about right .
If nothing else , it's interesting from a historical perspective	Mario Bava is generally credited with creating the Giallo with his 1963 movies The Girl Who Knew Too Much and Blood and Black Lace . While a few more examples were made in the 1960s , the Giallo really took-off after Dario Argento released The Bird with the Crystal Plumage in 1970 . I mention these two dates because I think they're important when discussing 1968's The Young , the Evil & the Savage because they point how early in the Giallo cycle it falls . Yet , strangely enough , the movie feels rater tired . It's difficult for me to explain why , but I'll give it a try . Part of the problem is that even though The Young , the Evil & the Savage is an early Giallo , it's actually rather unoriginal . There's very little new ground broken in the movie . It plays like a cross between the previously mentioned Blood and Black Lace and the 1962 film Werewolf in a Girls ' Dormitory . Replace the werewolf with a mad killer and copy some of Bava's murder scenes and you've got The Young , the Evil & the Savage . Another factor that makes The Young , the Evil & the Savage feel tired is its rather staid , conservative look especially when compared with other films of the same period . There's really no comparison between this film and Lucio Fulci's One on Top of the Other made just a year later . Fulci's film has that hip , colorful , groovy feel to it that is definitely a product of the swinging 60s . To this day , it maintains its fresh and interesting look . The Young , the Evil & the Savage , on the other hand , has a feel and look to it of something much older . Visually , it has more in common with the previously mentioned 1962 film Werewolf in a Girl's Dormitory than it does something from 1968 . There are , however , a couple of reasons to see this movie . First , if you're a Giallo fan , the novelty of seeing such an early example should not be bypassed . From a historical perspective , it's an interesting film . Second , the final twist where the killer is revealed is quite well done and is easily the highlight of the movie . I'm seen a number of Gialli with underwhelming finales , so it was nice to see one where the ending was not only a winner , but the best thing about the movie . Edit : I just watched Dark Sky's new transfer of The Young , the Evil , and the Savage ( or Naked You Die ) . Gotta say it was like watching a different movie . There's nothing like have a nice looking transfer with good sound and cuts restored to make you change your mind about a movie . It's still not the best Giallo I've ever seen , but my opinion has improved . Dark Sky's transfer gave the movie some of that funkiness I thought it so desperately needed . Things like the mod / matching clothes to the groovy title song really stood out . I'm definitely glad I gave it another chance .
A nice , early Spainish horror / thriller	A married man has a torrid affair with the previous owner of the house he has bought for his family . He tries to end the affair , but the woman will have none of that . She sets the house on fire killing his wife and child . Burned beyond recognition , the man vows revenge against his former lover . Overall , Pyro is a nice little horror / thriller . The plot , although predictable , is generally well paced and only gets bogged down by the love story on one or two brief occasions . It's the predictability that keeps me from rating Pyro much higher . There are a few chills to be had like the scene where the woman runs in fear down a deserted street at night , afraid that her disfigured lover is about the catch-up with her . The acting is a notch or two above what I have seen in other early Spanish horror films . Both Barry Sullivan and Martha Hyer give excellent performances in the lead roles . Hyer , in particular , is wonderful as the scheming , murderous ex-lover . Finally , the burn make-up is effectively creepy . It's the stuff of nightmares . A couple bits of trivia ? first , apparently Pyro was the first horror / thriller movie to be filmed in Spain . Whether it's true or not , I don't know . I just thought it was interesting . Second , cult fans may be interested in catching Pyro to see a young , pre-Franco Soledad Miranda in a small role . She doesn't do much , but she has a presence about her that's unmistakable .
I've never thought much of Robert Goulet , but he's good as David March	I Deal in Danger is not really a movie , but a couple episodes of a television show called " Blue Light " that were edited together . The show told the story of an Allied secret agent named David March who has defected to the German side . March has , for the most part , been accepted by the Nazi high command . In reality , March is a double agent still working with the Allies in their fight against Hitler and Nazi Germany . Because of its multi-episode television origin , I Deal in Danger features two distinct plot lines . The first , and probably my favorite , finds a skeptical SS officer ( Werner Peters ) looking to test March's loyalty to the Third Reich . Another British agent who wants to switch sides and work for Germany gives the SS officer his opportunity . What the SS officer doesn't know is that the Englishman is also a double agent . The second plot thread sees March get reassigned to a secret underground German weapons facility . March must convenience a female scientist to help him destroy the facility . Overall , I quite enjoyed I Deal in Danger . The film is well paced ( any boring bits from the television show were most likely edited out ) and reasonably entertaining throughout . There are a few surprises along the way such as the scientist who helps March being allowed to die in the explosion . It's not your standard happy ending . I've never thought much of Robert Goulet , but off the top of my head , this is probably one of the better things I've ever seen him in . Goulet is just rugged and cool enough to pull it off . And I really appreciate the fact that Goulet was allowed to play March completely straight without a hint of irony or comedy . The supporting cast is surprisingly strong with actors like Peters providing Goulet with an excellent nemesis . My biggest compliant is that Goulet's character is allowed to be something of a superman . There's one instance in the movie where March single handedly breaks into a Nazi prison to free a scientist . He seems to know exactly where the scientist is being held , he knows exactly where the guards are , and he knows exactly where to place his explosives . Such a mission would have been impossible . Finally , although there was obviously a decent budget involved , I Deal in Danger never overcomes its television roots . I'm not sure I know how to put this , but I Deal in Danger has a look and feel to it that just screams 60s American television . Until I watched I Deal in Danger , I had never even heard of " Blue Light " . It's not that odd considering I was only three years-old when it aired and there were only 17 episodes . Now , however , I would love to see someone bring the show to DVD . I know I'd buy it .
A case of voodoo	As in the previous episode , The Dreadful Doll begins with Dr . Quest doing some underwater research . His research is , however , put on hold when he is summoned to the bedside of a girl under a voodoo spell . Dr . Quest soon discovers that the girl has actually been poisoned . Meanwhile , Jonny and Hadji spot a mysterious submarine . Could the voodoo and the submarine be related ? In some ways , this episode of Jonny Quest reminds me of later Scooby Doo episodes in the way it's structured . You know , bad guys up to no good who use a local legend to scare off anyone who gets too close . The Dreadful Doll came first , so I'll give it a little credit on this front . And even though the main bad guy isn't all that memorable , Korbay , the voodoo practitioner , is a creepy enough foil for the Quest's . Weaknesses in the episode include too much time and focus spent on Bandit and the boys doing nothing remarkable ( I guess this is a problem I have with many of the Jonny Quest episodes ) . Another big problem I have with The Dreadful Doll is the quick announcement from Dr . Quest that it's not voodoo , but a drug that's affecting the little girl . Kind of took all the mystery out of things way too early .
Very nice $1 DV	- A group of American commandos , disguised as Italian solders , must infiltrate North Africa and take of an Italian outpost . In addition to the Axis forces in the area , the commandos face one other obstacle - a battle-hardened and battle-scarred sergeant who doesn't see eye-to-eye with his " green " commanding officer . This may prove to be the biggest hurdle that the American solders face . - Commandos has a lot to recommend - action , suspense , cast , and locations . The action sequences are first rate . The final battle scene is a thing of beauty and far exceeded my expectations given the films obviously limited budget . In between the moments of action , Crispino is able to inject the movie with some very suspenseful moments . For example , you can feel the tension in the air when the commandos have their first face-to-face meeting with some of the nearby German troops . Several Euro-movie regulars make-up an excellent supporting cast . Chief among them are Marino Mase ( the Italian officer who must work with the Americans to save his men ) and Joachim Fuchsberger ( the German officer who would rather be at home than fighting a war ) . The entire production takes place on what I felt were very authentic looking sets . If not for a couple of flaws , this could easily have become a personal favorite . - But there are flaws in Commandos . Chief among them is the usually solid Lee Van Cleef . You can look far and wide but I doubt you'll find anyone who overacts and chews the scenery quite like Van Cleef does in this movie . He plays Sgt . Sullivan , the grizzled solder who has seen more than his fair share of combat . He has issues taking commands from the new Captain and he doesn't mind showing it . The problem is that Sullivan shows his disdain for his new CO a little too often and a little too vocally . I just can't imagine a real solder questioning a superior officer quite like Sullivan does in Commandos . It would seem to be a sure fired way to get yourself court marshaled . To top it off , Sullivan's beef with the Captain is so superficial . He never gives the Captain a chance . He dislikes the man from the moment he hears his name . A more realistic disagreement between the two solders would have made the movie much better . - There are several budget companies that specialize in public domain films that have released Commandos . I paid all of $1 for my copy and couldn't be happier .
A big , heaping serving of cheese	I've only seen a handful of the Santo films , but Samson vs . the Vampire Women is so far my favorite . It's a cheese-filled extravaganza . The state of Wisconsin is jealous of the amount of cheese on display in this movie . What do you expect when you mix Santo , the masked Mexican wrestler , with a bevy of beautiful vampires ? I don't know about you , but I expect pure , delicious cheese . Going through a plot summary or analyzing the positives and negatives seems a bit silly with a movie like Samson vs . the Vampire Women . Instead , I'll try to hit on some of the more fun , but bizarre , moments from the movie : 1 . Even though he's called Samson by everyone in the movie and the title lists him as Samson , someone forgot to tell the crowd at the wrestling arena who seem overly exuberant in chanting " Santo ! " 2 . Apparently , Santo has a closed circuit television camera mounted to the front of his impossibly small sports car . 3 . You simply must watch the dubbed version . The dubbing is so bad that it adds a whole other dimension to the movie . 4 . Mexican vampire women are the hottest . 5 . Santo has an uncanny knack of showing up just after the person he's protecting has been kidnapped . Why not just stay put and be there when the bad guys make their move ? 6 . Why does Professor Orlof ask the police for their help throughout the movie ? They seem to be incapable of even the most routine of police activities . 7 . Don't feel bad about fast forwarding through the incredibly long and dull wrestling matches . It makes watching Santo that much more enjoyable . 8 . It's odd that Santo can do battle with three vampire goons and come out on top , yet when going one-on-one in a wrestling ring , he gets the snot beat out of him . There are more , but you get the idea . Watching Santo is best done with an open mind and the notion that nothing is to be taken seriously . If you do this , you're bound to have a good time with Samson vs . the Vampire Women .
" You dirty little dumb broad ! "	An undercover female police officer is sent to prison to infiltrate a gang of female convicts and help them escape . By gaining their trust , the police hope that the gang will lead them to a fortune in diamonds buried somewhere in the swamps of Louisiana . But things don't go quite as planned . Greed and lust take over as the women start fighting each other over the diamonds and their male hostage . Call me crazy , but I enjoyed Swamp Diamonds ( or Swamp Women if you prefer ) more than a lot of people seem to . Don't get me wrong , I can see all of the problems with this Roger Corman effort that others have pointed out ? dodgy acting , padding galore , plot holes , etc . And to find any entertainment in the movie , you've got to get past scenes that tend to drag and plod . But once you do , Swamp Diamonds is a joy of 50s exploitation . It's got it all : a crazy story , buried treasure , escaped female convicts , Beverly Garland , guns , over the top acting , short-shorts , alligators , and " Touch " Connors ( " Touch " ? What's up with that ? ) Together , these elements combine to make this one quite a bit of fun . It's not perfect , but I've got no problem rating Swamp Diamonds a . This is another movie that I might not have discovered if it weren't for Mystery Science Theater 3000 . Maybe I was just having fun with the movie , but I'll give this episode of MST3K a ? worth seeking out .
" How do you kill mud ? "	While doing exercises on the using a Geiger counter and locating radiation , a group of British soldiers runs across " something " that leaves two of their members severely burned as if they had been exposed to high levels of radiation . In no time at all , citizens nearby begin suffering the same fate . What's behind these " attacks " ? Based on the available evidence , Dr . Adam Royston ( Dean Jagger ) puts forth a theory that some kind of energy based creature from the depths of the earth has come to the surface in search of radiation that it uses as food . But how is he gong to stop something that seems so unstoppable ? Compared with some of the more cheesy sci-fi movies of the 50s or some of the big budget modern sci-fi spectacles , X : The Unknown seems like a very quaint little movie . It may not be quite as fun or exciting as those other movies , but it is an enjoyable , low-key experience . In the lead role , Dean Jagger gives what I would describe as a solid , but understated performance ( much like the rest of the movie ) . I appreciate that for a change he plays a scientist who admits he doesn't have all the answers . My biggest problem with Jagger ( and it really has nothing to do with him ) is that I've seen White Christmas so many times that he will forever be General Waverly in my mind . I joked with a friend that throughout X : The Unknown , I kept waiting for Rosemary Clooney to come out and sing " Sisters " . The rest of the cast gives similarly strong but mostly unmemorable performances . This being Hammer , Michael Ripper is quite naturally on board . There's something very comfortable about seeing Ripper in a movie . It's like knowing that for an hour and a half , you're in good hands . Technically , the movie is very strong . The direction is what I would call very deliberate ? nothing flashy , just telling a story . The cinematography is quite nice . Unlike some of Hammer's more famous films , X : The Unknown was filmed in beautiful black and white . And the B & W images look good to my untrained eye . James Bernard , who would go on to compose some wonderful scores for Hammer , created a very fitting musical track for the movie . Finally , the special effects are a real highlight for me . Sure , you could probably do more with CGI , but as I've said any number of times , there's something about the miniatures and other process shots like those in X : The Unknown that shows a real craftsmanship missing from today's movies .
I'm glad to have seen this again after 34 years	I think I was 8 years-old when I saw Gargoyles back in 1972 . It absolutely scared the pants off me . I'll never forget the sight of those clawed hands reaching over the foot of the bed . I had trouble sleeping for days and I checked and rechecked the foot of my own bed several times each night . . And while it no longer has that kind of effect on me , considering its television origins , Gargoyles still provides a few chills along the way . I admit that when I rewatched it tonight , those hands on the bed did make me jump . To a lot of modern audiences raised on more sophisticated special effects , Gargoyles may seem silly . Sure , there are flaws with the special effects ( for example , it's quite obvious that the creatures ' skins are body suits ) , but there's something about them that makes the whole thing a lot of fun . Maybe it's the wings or maybe it's the variety of looks or maybe they just remind me of Sleestaks , but whatever it is , they work for me . The mask Bernie Casey wears is especially frightening even though it obvious he has no real movement in his face . One thing that could have made the film better for me is if Grayson Hall had had more screen time . I always enjoy her campy , over-the-top performances . It's a shame she had so little to do and was killed off so early . Finally , as I watched the movie earlier tonight , it dawned on me that I was not hearing Bernie Casey's voice coming from the lead gargoyle . I was probably too young to know the difference 34 years ago , but something about that voice reminded me of my childhood . And then it suddenly hit me where I had heard that voice before . After the movie was over , I checked on IMDb and , sure enough , I was right . Dr . Zin ! ! ! That's right . The gargoyle's voice was done by the same man ( Vic Perrin ) who did Dr . Zin .
Another film that needs a good , legitimate Region 1 release .	I am a Dario Argento fan . Some of his films like Suspiria , Deep Red , and Tenebre are among my all-time favorites . Until just recently , however , there was one notable entry on Argento's filmography that I had not seen ? Four Flies on Grey Velvet . Maybe I had built it up to much in my mind or maybe it was the bad transfer or maybe it's just not that good , but to say I was disappointed would be an understatement . Before I get to the problems I have with Four Flies on Grey Velvet , I'll cover a few things that worked for me . First , the scenario the protagonist finds himself in the middle of is brilliant . In a scuffle over a knife , a man accidentally stabs and kills a stalker who has been following him for weeks . Unknown to our protagonist , there was a witness with a camera present who issues a series of threats against his life . He can't go to the police as his crime will be discovered . And the blackmailer doesn't seem to want money , just his life . It's a terrific set-up . Second , Argento is able to create some nice atmosphere and suspense , especially in the scenes where the blackmailer enters the man's house . Just imagine having someone who wants you dead seemingly able to come and go at will from your house . It's a chilling thought and Argento makes the most of these nighttime scenes . But there are problems with Four Flies on Grey Velvet that I cannot overlook . To begin with , the casting is horrible . Michael Brandon makes the most unappealing lead I've seen in an Argento film . Because he makes no emotional connection with the viewer ( at least with this viewer ) , it's hard to care about what happens to him . And Mimsy Farmer is just plain old bad . Then there's the comedy Argento decided to put in the movie . A little comic relief is one thing , but this is too much . For example , every scene with the mailman is so totally ridiculous that it takes away from any suspense Argento had been able to create . Finally , the clue that leads to the killer's revelation is preposterous . This is 1950s b-movie , sci-fi stuff ? not Argento . If the legal questions surrounding the rights of Four Flies on Grey Velvet are ever resolved and the movie gets a legitimate Region 1 release , I'll definitely give it another chance . As I said in my opening paragraph , the transfer on the DVD-R I watched was horrible and cut . Plus , I'll go into the film a second time without the overly lofty expectations . Until then , however , a is the best I can do .
The Magic is Gone	- Although I'm not in the target audience , I've read all of the Harry Potter books . I watched and enjoyed both of the first two Harry Potter movies . I have been waiting quit a while to finally get the chance to see Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban . I don't know when I've been more disappointed with a movie . - From the very start , the movie feels rushed . It's amazing that the longest of the Harry Potter books was turned into the shortest of the Harry Potter movies . There's just so much that's left out . Take Harry's crush on an older student , Cho Chang . This relationship is so important to the next book and she is not even mentioned in this installment . I realize that to include everything in the book would have meant a 6 hour movie , but to leave out plot points like this is unforgivable . - Unless your a fan of the books or have seen the first two movies , Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban must be a very difficult movie to follow . I mean I've read the book twice and still had trouble keeping up with what was going on . Take the line spoken by one of Harry's teachers with no explanation , " Five points from Gryffindor ! " I can just imagine someone asking themselves " Five Points ? What Five Points ? " or " Gryffindor ? What the hell is a Gryffindor ? " - I realize that my biggest complaint about the movie is something that is difficult to put into words , but ( and excuse the pun ) the magic is gone . I sat in wonderment of the magic power the first two movies had . Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban didn't come close to giving me that same feeling . For the most part , it just left me cold .
Cushing is good , but the plot isn't	The Crown , suspecting smuggling and tax evasion , sends Captain Collier to investigate the inhabitants of a seaside village . What he finds is a small community where things just don't seem right . The locals , even the Reverend , seem to be hiding something . But the only thing the Captain's investigation turns up for sure is a roving band of horrific marsh creatures . Are these horse-riding , living-dead things for real or are they just a ploy on the part of the smugglers to keep prying eyes at bay ? What Works : - Peter Cushing , of Course . I've said it before and I'll say it again ? I don't care how bad , boring , or pointless the material , Peter Cushing always seems to rise above what he's presented with and gives a fantastic performance . If you ignore the haircut ( just joking ) , Cushing's work in Night Creatures is among his best . - The Rest of the Cast . And the good acting in Night Creatures goes well beyond Cushing . The rest of the cast is just as good . Oliver Reed , Michael Ripper , Patrick Allen , and the incredibly beautiful Yvonne Romain are all excellent . - The Marsh Creatures . The first time the marsh creatures are shown , it's quite a sight . Although not as creepy as the dead horsemen from The Blind Dead series , they're very comparable . Add to that the scarecrow with the moving eyes and you've got a really nice horror moment . What Doesn't Work : - Not Enough of the Marsh Creatures . The marsh creatures are the real highlight of the movie for me . But , with only two brief appearances , there is not enough of them . More marsh creatures might have made this a real winner . - Too Predictable . The big twist ending was , at least for me , telegraphed from a mile away . Without giving anything away , I'll just say that the relationships between the characters are far too easy to predict . There's no subtlety as to what is coming next . The supposed surprise at the end of Night Creatures ( which wasn't much of a surprise ) really hurt a lot of what came before . While I may never look at Night Creatures as the best thing Hammer ever did , it's entertaining enough . Ultimately , had the movie provided more in the way of surprises , I'm sure I would have enjoyed it much more . As it is , it's a terrific opportunity to watch two of my favorite actors , Peter Cushing and Oliver Reed , at their best .
Massi and Merli team-up for a fun , action packed ride	If you're a fan of the Italian polizia thriller , the names Stelvio Massi and Maurizio Merli should be familiar . The pair , whether together or individually , are responsible for some of the best this genre has to offer . They teamed-up to make 1978's Convoy Busters and , for the most part , came up with a winner . The action is almost non-stop . It's a violent , sometimes bloody ride full of chase scenes and gun battles . And the pace rarely lets up . There are few directors who did action as well as Massi . He shows his mastery of action in several set-pieces in Convoy Busters with the chase scene involving the helicopter being among the best I've seen . The final slow-motion shoot out is a thing of beauty . As for Merli , when he's not busy posing for the camera ( which he has a tendency to do too often ) , he was a good action star . He's big and physical enough to effectively and believably pull of the role . And , unless I'm terribly mistaken , he did a lot of his own stunts . Watching Convoy Busters is like watching two movies in one . The plot is neatly split into halves with neither having much to do with the other . In the first half , Merli is a police officer stationed in Rome . He grows increasingly tired of the violence he faces on a daily basis . He's working on a case involving a well-connected smuggler . But because of bureaucracy and leaks within the police department , his quarry gets away . Frustrated with the experience , he asks for a transfer to a small sea side town where things are much quieter . Enter the second half of the movie . In his new environment , the most dangerous thing Merli faces is the boredom of a town where nothing seems to happen . That is until Merli uncovers a smuggling operation in his new quiet hometown . He's soon thrust back into the violence he sought to escape . But it's this plot structure that I found to be the weakest element in Convoy Busters . The first half of the movie ends with the bad guy boarding a plane and heading off to Geneva . Unfortunately , he's never mentioned again . This plot thread is never satisfactorily resolved . I would have liked it had Merli met up with him again at some point in the movie . After making an emotional investment of time , I expected a payoff .
Very enjoyable krimi	I'm still relatively new to these krimis , but I rate Creature with the Blue Hand as one of the best I've seen so far . It's the story of man named Dave Emerson ( Klaus Kinski ) who has been committed to an asylum for murdering his family's gardener . Dave escapes and makes his way home ( which is conveniently located a stones throw from the asylum ) and attempts to convince anyone who will listen that he's innocent . But it's difficult for his family and Scotland Yard to believe Dave as the bodies begin to pile-up ? There's certainly plenty to enjoy in Creature with the Blue Hand ? a crazy twin brother , a devilishly sinister medieval glove with retractable spikes , secret passageways , a mad doctor , and enough suspense to keep most fans happy . Creature with the Blue Hand is successful in creating that one ingredient necessary for a film of this type ? atmosphere . The film has a nice pace to it and never seems to drag . The acting is hit or miss at best . Kinski gives a nice , restrained performance . The sets are amazing and far exceed the film's obviously limited budget . Even though the film is set in modern times , the sets would have been perfect for a period piece . The DVD I watched also features an American cut of the film , re-titled The Bloody Dead . This version contains 15 or so minutes of added gore scenes filmed some 20 years after the original movie was made . I haven't watched it yet and , based on everything I've read , I probably never will .
Creepy Gothic Fun	The Creeping Flesh is good , old-fashioned fun . The Creeping Flesh has that one ingredient necessary for a successful Gothic horror ? atmosphere . From the minute that Peter Cushing opens that crate he's brought back with him from New Guinea , you just know nothing good is going to come from that bizarre looking skeleton . All it takes is having that " thing " laying there to create effective atmosphere . The slight sound that can be heard every time Freddie Francis gives us a close up of the thing only adds to the unease . And when you throw the shots of the " evil " blood ( regardless of how preposterous the idea is ) Cushing is able to draw form the creature , you've the foundation for a very nice Gothic horror film . The subplot involving Cushing's daughter going mad is also well done . In large part , I think the credit has to go to Lorna Helbron . She is believable as both the demure , obedient girl and the tantalizing , violent woman . I bought her genteel table manners as much as I did her wild gestations from behind bars . It's really a nice performance . The rest of the cast is more than up to the challenge . Any Gothic horror film is better when Peter Cushing and / or Christopher Lee are in the cast . By Lee's standards , his performance is what I would call average . Much of the blame for that has to be the attributed to the script as Lee is given very little to do . Cushing , on the other hand , is dynamite . He goes through a range of emotions and satisfactorily pulls them all off . I especially like the ending of The Creeping Flesh when you see that Cushing has been talking so sincerely and earnestly to ? ? well , never mind - that would spoil it .
A very familiar story	Carlos Monzon ( World Middleweight Boxing Champion for over 7 years ) is Marco Russo , a stranger in town looking for a job . He learns that the only real work is with one of the two competing crime families that run the city . Marco gets a job as a heavy for one of the groups and quickly proves to be very valuable . But it's not long before Marco is scheming to turn the two crime families against each other . Marco's actions result in a full-scale gang war . But what is Marco's motivation ? Is it purely financial or is there something more ? If any of my poorly written plot synopsis sounds familiar then you've probably seen Sergio Leone's A Fistful of Dollars ( or Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo , a movie that I shamefully haven't seen even though I've owned the Criterion disc for about two years ) . I wouldn't go so far as to call it a modern day remake , but the two movies do share some major similarities . And the similarities go beyond the obvious plot structure and include what I consider to be minor plot points . For example , Marco helps a woman and her daughter escape from one of the crime bosses , Rico Manzetti ( Luc Merenda ) , who has been using them for his sexual gratification . Clint Eastwood's character did the exact same thing in A Fistful of Dollars . The Last Round starts out fairly slowly as Marco gains a feel for how things operate . But once the bullets start flying , the movie rarely lets up . Merenda plays his role as the sadistic crime boss Manzetti to perfection . He's decidedly evil and , fortunately for those watching the movie , shows it at every opportunity . The movie eventually builds to the inevitable and very satisfying showdown between Marco and Rico . NoShame's new Region 1 DVD is another winner . Although the transfer does show some print damage in a couple of instances , it doesn't appear to be the fault or lack of interest on the part of NoShame . Most of the image is very good . Overall , this is a must for fans of Italian crime films .
Lon Chaney , Jr . - The Love God	While doing field research , Professor Norman Reed ( Lon Chaney , Jr . ) meets and falls in love with a beautiful , exotic woman . He marries her and brings her home . Things couldn't be any better for the Professor . That is , until he discovers his wife is still practicing the voodoo type ceremonies of her homeland . He forbids her from carrying on with the superstitious mumbo-jumbo . But at what price ? Professor Reed's life is suddenly turned upside-down and he faces the ultimate ? a charge of murder . Is it the voodoo or something more close to home but equally sinister that threatens Professor Reed's future ? Of the six Inner Sanctum mysteries , Weird Woman is one of my favorites ( Pillow of Death being the other ) . I suppose some who've seen the movie might think I've overrated it , but these kinds of movies work for me . Weird Woman is a quick-paced mystery that , at just over 60 minutes , never outstays its welcome . The " mystery " isn't really hard to figure out , but the all the back-stabbing and other trickery is a lot of fun . The cast is a blast . Besides Chaney , Weird Woman features some of the best females working in B-films of the 40s ? Anne Gwynne , Evelyn Ankers , Lois Collier , and Elizabeth Russell . Overall , I've go very few complaints . One thing that really puzzles me every time I've seen Weird Woman is the way the script has almost every female in the cast react to Chaney . Watching beautiful women like Gwynne , Ankers , and Collier swoon after Chaney is a hoot !
" Doomed . . . You're all doomed . "	Friday the 13th may not have been the first movie of its kind and the kill scenes may have been copied from other movies , but there's no denying the importance of the film . Friday the 13th is the film I see as most responsible for the slasher boom of the 80s . It and its sequels proved that horror fans were willing to pay money to see practically the same movie ( with slight modifications ) over and over . As I look back at it now , it seems a bit silly to me , but I was one of those who willing plopped down my money every few years for a chance to see another Friday the 13th movie . I don't see any point in going through the plot . Most horror fans know it by heart . Instead , I'll cover a few of the things I like about the movie . First , the kill scenes . Tom Savini's special effects are great . I especially like the scene where Kevin Bacon is speared from under the bed . Second , regardless of the number of times I've seen it , the film does have an atmosphere of fear about it . The repetitive music , the unseen killer , and the bodies dropping at every turn have always given me chills . Third , I enjoy the final showdown between the killer and the " final girl " . I've always thought the final fight scene was a highlight of the film . Finally , and this is a personal thing , but Friday the 13th was the first movie of its type I ever saw . I hadn't seen movies like Halloween or Black Christmas when I first saw this one . Therefore , it holds a special place with me . Unfortunately , even though I'm a fan , I see problems . The biggest is the predictability of the plot . Even though Friday the 13th was made early in the slasher cycle , how hard was it to predict the outcome ? Also , the characters in the movie are incredibly stupid . A lot of the murders could have been prevented if anyone at any point in the movie had demonstrated any brain power . But then it wouldn't have been so much fun . It may not be the kind of movie the more " sophisticated " horror fan admits to enjoying , but I'm not above admitting that Friday the 13th remains a favorite of mine . It's fun stuff !
Deliciously inept 70s trash	Fans of trashy , bad 1970s cinema gather ' round . I've found a real winner ? Death Machines . Calling Death Machines " so bad it's good " doesn't begin to explain how deliriously enjoyable this movie truly is . Sure , it's bad ? in fact you'd have a hard time finding anything quite so inept ? but it's also an incredibly fun experience . What little plot the movie has concerns three assassins for hire ? one white , one black , and one Asian ( Think of the Death Machines as the Rainbow Coalition of killers - how politically correct ! ) . These killers are all but indestructible ? they're even impervious to bullets ( the movie may have explained why or how , but I must have missed it ) . On a mission to take out a local karate studio , they inadvertently leave one man alive . They may have taken off one of his hands , but he's alive nonetheless . The police can't seem to find any leads into the karate studio killings , so it's up to our hero , Whining One Hand ( as I like to call him ) , to bring down the gang of killers . Oh where to start ? This is one of those instances where I could easily write paragraph after paragraph about the ineptitude on display in Death Machines . But I'm not sure I can do the thing the justice it deserves . So instead , I'll summarize some of the highlights : - The plot is little more than one set-piece after the next that only fit together because some of the characters are the same . The attack on the karate studio , the killing of the man in the phone booth , the bazooka shot at the airplane , the obligatory fight scene in the police station , and the bombing of the bank president ? the only connection is that a familiar character or two appears in each scene . Otherwise , you might get the wrong idea and start to think the Death Machines actually had no real , coherent plot ( wink , wink ) . - The killers receive their marching orders from one of screendoms most bizarre master criminals . Madame Lee ( and I only know her name by reading the credits on IMDb ) is one weird cookie . To begin with , she seems incapable of opening her mouth and speaking as a normal person might . Between that , her thick accent , and the boom operator's inability to get close to her , it makes it just about impossible to understand what she's saying . And then there's that wig ! Why in God's name did anyone think it would be a good look to have her wear a 12-inch high geisha wig ? She looks ridiculous . Add to that her strange way of walking , her unusual choice of wardrobe , and her totally out of place facial expressions and Madame Lee is a sight that must be seen to be believed . - The fight choreography is laughable . The opening fight scenes where Madame Lee is picking her three killers is beyond ridiculous . My 6 year-old son takes karate and I'm sure he and a few of his friends could have put together more believable fight set-pieces . And what's with the gun ? Who told the white guy to bring a gun to a karate fight ? And was it just me or were the opening fights rigged to ensure the racial diversity of Death Machines ? White guy fighting white guy , black guy fighting black guy , Asian guy fighting Asian guy ? It's too funny . - Has there ever been a more ineffective hero than Whining One Hand ? When not whining about his problems , getting beat-up by an old man in the bar he works at , or making love to the most unappealing nurse imaginable ( I think I might have just thrown up a little in my mouth thinking about it ) , one of his lone contributions to the movie is to follow the bad guys , crawl through the tall grass , and watch as they blow up a plane and the unknown passengers therein . Does he do anything at all to try to stop the baddies ? NO . He merely watches . By the time he shows up at the run-down house ( that's obviously a stand-in for an opulent mansion - just use your imagination ) the Death Machines have left , Madame Lee's right hand man is already dead , and yet he still manages to get attacked by the wobbly sword welding Madame Lee and her gigantic wig . What does our hero do ? Again ? nothing . Thank God the police were on hand to take out the dragon lady or Whining One Hand might have ended up being Whining No Hand . On and on it goes ( I haven't even gotten into the technical issues , the lack of any sort of ending , the inappropriate Casio keyboard music , or the old time gospel music played over the fight scene in the grocery store / bar ) . Death Machines is a real hoot of a movie that I implore all fans of bad 70s trash movies to seek out . You won't be disappointed . As for my rating , I'll be honest , rating movies like Death Machines is difficult . On one had , it's a stinker of epic proportions . But , on the other hand , I've always said that I rate movies based on my enjoyment . And with that in mind , I have to give Death Machines at least a even with its numerous and all too obvious problems . Be warned , if the notion of a bad , plot-less 70s movie with characters that have no motivation or acting ability and big bad wigs with speech impediments doesn't appeal to you , stay away . Otherwise , enjoy !
Despite all its shortcomings , forced patriotism , and light as air plot , I enjoyed it	To the Shores of Tripoli is the kind of movie that I generally don't care for . The title may conjure images of Marines fighting and dying on some foreign shore , but you won't find that here . Instead you'll find a flag-waving recruitment film that makes Marine basic training look like a trip to summer camp . The movie makes it seem that the entire eight week training is made up of little more than marching and doing drills in a parking lot . And when these guys aren't in the parking lot , they're pulling pranks and wooing nurses they've been told to leave alone . Abbott and Costello's Buck Privates has more in the way of military realism than To the Shores of Tripoli . Yet despite all its shortcomings , forced patriotism , and light as air plot , I enjoyed To the Shores of Tripoli . I was somehow able to put my brain on hold and go along for the ride . It's harmless , good-natured fun . Most of my enjoyment probably comes from the three main leads . John Payne , Maureen O'Hara , and Randolph Scott do a solid job with what they're given to work with . Much of the comedy works , particularly the hospital scene where Payne fakes an injury to be near O'Hara . And , To the Shores of Tripoli has an innocence to it that you don't find in movies anymore that I find appealing .
It may not be Fulci's best , but I like it	- Fulci's The Black Cat is " freely adapted " from Poe's story . I suppose that " freely adapted " means that the last 10 minutes might bear a vague resemblance . The Black Cat is the story of a man who uses his psychic abilities to force his cat to kill for him . But the tables soon turn when the man tries to kill the cat . The cat becomes master and uses the man . - The more Fulci I see , the more impressed I become . I started out with a couple that many people list among their favorites ( The House by the Cemetery and City of the Living Dead ) and neither did anything for me . But now that I've seen The Beyond , The Black Cat , A Lizard in Woman's Skin , and Don't Torture a Duckling , my opinion has changed . I now see the genius of Fulci that I've heard others rave about over the years . The Black Cat may not be his best , but it's an enjoyable Gothic thriller with loads of atmosphere . While the gore quotient may be turned down , there's still a few scenes that are undeniably Fulci . - Patrick Magee , in one of his final roles , gives a very solid performance as the mad psychic . He effectively displays a wide array of emotions and is generally believable in each . Magee really was in the same class with the likes of Karloff when it came to portraying menace . Mimsy Farmer co-stars as a photographer who is as dull as dishwater . - The cinematography is another area that stands out . Sergio Salvati presents some very noteworthy camera work . Chief among the scenes that stand out are the ones shot from the cat's point of view . The way the camera moves through the grass just as a cat would are very nicely done . - The weakest point of the movie , as is so often the case with Italian horror , is the plot . Much of it makes little sense . For example , why does Magee really want these people dead ? There's no clear motivation from what I could tell . Also , there are several plot threads that look interesting , but are not explored in any detail . The example I'll cite here is the exploration of the ruins . They look interesting , but we learn nothing about them and only see them in one ten minute stretch of the movie .
Funky 60s Killer	There's a lot going on in The College Girl Murders . A mad scientist creates an almost undetectable poisonous gas . Before he can reap the rewards of his discovery , the scientist is killed by a hooded , whip-welding monk . After a co-ed is killed in a church by the gas , Scotland Yard is called in to investigate , but the killing continues . Who can stop this mad killer who seems to be able to come and go as he pleases in and out of the college ? What Works : - The Killer . What's not to like about a killer who sneaks around wearing a vivid red KKK looking outfit , complete with red gloves . The white whip he carries and uses very effectively stands out nicely against the bright red gown . Although the idea of a killer in a flaming red , pointy-head outfit sneaking around a girl's school is fairly far-fetched , it's one of the more sinister looking costumes I've seen . - Groovy 60s Music . I really would like to track down the title music to The College Girl Murders . It's got a jazzy , hip , 60s feel to it that I just loved . - Bizarre Touches . Beyond the killer's red gown and hood , the movie features a sliding fireplace , a pit of alligators with a cage handing overhead , poison spraying bibles , a strategically placed mannequin , mini-skirts , go-go boots , and mile high hair . I would describe it as a cross between the 60s Batman TV show and an Italian giallo . The College Girl Murders is a real treat for the eye . - The End . Let's just say that there are more twists than a mountain road . Just when you think the killer has been uncovered , here comes a twist ? . . and another ? . and another ? and another . What Doesn't Work : - Chief Inspector Sir John . I know the guy was meant to be comic relief , but his buffoonish character has way too much screen time . - Why Have Alligators ? Previously , I mentioned the alligators in the pit . And while they are a nice touch , they serve very little purpose . Why go through all the trouble and not use them ? - Plodding Plot . Some of The College Girl Murders has no flow or rhythm to it . There are far too many moments throughout the movie when things come inexplicably to a screeching halt . Better pacing would have made this a much more enjoyable movie . I haven't seen many of these German krimis but of the few I have seen ( Phantom of Soho , Strangler of Blackmoor Castle , Dead Eyes of London ) this may be my favorite . This one has a real funky feel to it that I really go into . Had the plot flowed a little better , I could have easily given The College Girl Murders a .
Entertaining	- Surprise , surprise - a James Bond spoof that works . Richard Johnson ( of The Haunting fame ) is Bulldog Drummond , a insurance investigator trying to uncover what happened to one of the planes his company had written a policy on . It's not long before anyone with information for him turns up dead . And most of the deaths " appear " to be accidents . Before you can say " Shaken , Not Stirred " , Drummond is up to his neck in hired killers and a mad genius . - Deadlier Than the Male has a lot to enjoy . The 60s feel , Johnson's Drummond , Nigel Green , terrific locations , and the implausible yet wonderful gadgets and traps are all a delight . But my absolute favorite moments are those between the two hired henchmen ( or should that be henchwomen or maybe even henchpersons ) played by Elke Sommer and Sylva Koscina . There constant spats and barbed remarks are a riot . - There are a lot of bad Bond wannabes out there , this is one of the good ones .
More plot twists than a mountain road and boatload of red herrings .	A jewel thief is brutally murdered on a train by a masked assailant . But when the murderer is unable to locate any diamonds , the murderer immediately suspects that the thief's daughter , a Parisian stripper named Nicole ( Nieves Navarro aka Susan Scott ) , may have the diamonds . Nicole , however , claims to know nothing of the diamonds . After a series of threats , both verbal and physical , Nicole decides to flee France with a man she hardly knows . The pair begin a seemingly ideal relationship in a secluded seaside village . But Nicole is unaware that the killer has followed her to England and will stop at nothing to get his hands on the diamonds . What a fun Giallo ! Death Walks on High Heels has one of the most convoluted plots I've run into ? even by Giallo standards . While the movie may lack the quantity of murder scenes found in other Gialli ( although at least one murder scene is as violent as they come ) , Death Walks on High Heels makes up for this shortcoming with more plot twists than a mountain road and boatload of red herrings . It had me guessing ( incorrectly , I might add ) up to the very end . It's all about the mystery and director Luciano Ercoli skillfully casts the shadow of suspicion on just about everyone in the cast . Much of the movie is told quite nicely in flashbacks with bits and pieces of the story being revealed as each person confesses to what they may or may not have seen . There's even a pair of bumbling Scotland Yard detectives who are ( surprise , surprise ) actually funny . Overall , Death Walks on High Heels is very well done . The acting is a notch or two above what I've come to expect in a Giallo . The highlight , at least for me , is Nieves Navarro . She is amazing as Nicole . I didn't think I would ever say this , but I think she might have been capable of challenging Edwige Fenech in my mind as the Queen of the Giallo had she made a few more of these movies . I'm looking forward to checking out more of her work . As much as I enjoyed Death Walks on High Heels , it's not without its flaws . Chief among them , at least to me , is a " cheat " with respect to one of the murders . I don't want to give anything away , but there is one particularly nasty murder that the killer could not have committed given the circumstances immediately following the murder . Hopefully , with repeat viewings , I can reconcile this point in my mind and just enjoy the movie for what it is . Finally , and I'm really starting to sound like a shill , NoShame's new DVD is fantastic . I would have never dreamed that a movie like Death Walks on High Heels would look this good . Bravo NoShame !
" Do you like my new dress ? My new old dress ? "	Jessica ( Zohra Lampert ) is a troubled woman . Recently " cured " of a psychological disorder , she and her husband , along with a friend , move to a large house in the country . Upon arriving , they find a mysterious , but agreeable woman named Emily ( Mariclare Costello ) living in their house . They invite her to stay and things seem to be going smoothly . But Jessica has started having visions again . She sees people who aren't there , hears voices , and discovers dead bodies . No one else notices anything . Is Jessica going mad ? Or is there something more evil going on ? For the most part , Let's Scare Jessica to Death works as a slow-moving , atmospheric horror film . If you need chainsaws rumbling , masked killers , and blood spurting , steer clear of this one . But if you're a fan of slow-burn , subtle horror , you will find a lot to enjoy . There are moments in Let's Scare Jessica to Death that go beyond creepy and enter the realm of downright scary . The film has the feel to it of something just under the surface you can't see , but scares you nonetheless . Images like Emily coming out of the water in her wedding dress are classic . And , overall the film looks great ? and by great I mean suitably dark and foreboding . The acting is generally good with Costello giving a standout performance . A lot has been written about Lampert ? some going so far as to call her performance " Oscar Worthy " . To me , she seems to be trying a bit too hard . Yeah , we know she's a nutcase , but that doesn't excuse some of the over-the-top histrionics . Get over yourself ! Notice I wrote that Let's Scare Jessica to Death works " for the most part " . I have never cared for the ending . The finale takes the film in a completely different direction from anything that comes before . For lack of a better work , it's too obvious . It's as if someone demanded something more overt in the ending . A more subtle , mysterious ending would have fit better with the atmospheric feeling that the film had been building . Instead , we're given an ending that really harms what is otherwise a classic horror film .
Barbara Steele - What more could you ask for ?	Castle of Blood is a good example of the quality work in the horror genre being turned out in Italy in the 60s . The film has all of the right elements - old dark house , atmosphere , a decent story , and Barbara Steele . Steele makes most any film worth seeing . The story concerns a haunted castle . People have visited , but none have returned . Our hero makes a wager that he can spend the night in the castle and return to collect his winnings . But , the night he visits is a special night . It's the night each year when the dead return to relive their deaths . The only flaw I see in the movie is the running time . It almost feels padded . There is a large portion of the first act where literally nothing happens . Our hero stumbles around in the dark finding nothing of interest . But once he does find something , the movie picks up and become quite enjoyable . Castle of Blood is a definite must for Steele fans and fans of Italian Gothic horror in general .
" We can't claim to be the town virgins and can't afford to be the town tramps . "	Frank Sinatra does his best to bring the tough talking , hard drinking , womanizing detectives of the 1940s into the 1960s . Sinatra plays detective Tony Rome much like I would image Bogart would have had he been alive . Sinatra doesn't do much of anything that Bogart wasn't doing when he played either Philip Marlowe or Sam Spade . In fact , beyond the characters , there are other similarities . Much as Bogart had his falcon , Rome has his diamond stickpin . And just as Bogart was forever carrying Carmen Sternwood home after one too many , Rome seems to be always at hand to make sure the Kosterman daughter gets home safely . In a way , it's this familiarity that makes me enjoy Tony Rome more than I probably should . Realistically , I've probably overrated the movie . You're not going to find anything award worthy here and Sinatra is doing little more than playing Sinatra . But it is fun and I always have a good time watching it . The mystery surrounding the stickpin keeps my attention even after having seen the movie three times . And what more can you really ask of a movie . Other highlights for me beyond the plot include some really cool scenes of Miami in the 60s and Jill St . John in a bikini .
Interesting	Universal gave the classic horror fan a real treat with their series of short documentaries . While I don't necessarily thing that Mummy Dearest is the best of the bunch , it's informative and entertaining . My only complaint is that not enough time was spent on the sequels to The Mummy . I would have loved to see more on these lesser known films . Through interviews with films experts and surviving relatives , Mummy Dearest presents some fascinating insights into the making of The Mummy . One of my favorites was the story of the feud between star Zita Johann and director Karl Freund . Good stuff . Another highlight is the interview segments with special effects wizard Rick Baker . His insights into what Karloff went through to be made-up as the mummy are very interesting . Mummy Dearest , and the other documentaries in the series , are some of the best DVD extras I've seen . Good work Universal !
No phone ! No lights ! No motor cars !	While I admit that the Chan films of Warner Oland are , as a group , superior to those of Sidney Toler , that doesn't mean that some of the Toler films aren't rock solid and as good individually as anything Oland made . Three that immediately come to mind are Charlie Chan at Treasure Island , Charlie Chan at the Wax Museum , and this film , Castle in the Desert . ( By the way , why isn't the title Charlie Chan and the Castle in the Desert ? It would have made sense to me . ) In Castle in the Desert , Charlie is summoned to a strange , isolated castle in the middle of the Mojave Desert . But no one in the house will admit to having sent of Chan . His presence is , however , quickly needed when in no time at all Charlie finds himself up to his elbows in murder , poison , deadly arrows , red herrings , and suspects galore . What could be more fun ! I've seen someone use this phrase before to describe a Charlie Chan film and I think it fits Castle in the Desert ? " It's a crackling good mystery " . As I've indicated , all of the necessary ingredients for a fun outing with Chan are here . In fact , Castle in the Desert is really more like two mysteries in one . While the solution to the first is fairly obvious , it's still a lot of fun and just an appetizer for the more difficult and dangerous mystery to come . This was Toler's last Chan film for Fox and , by the time this one was made , Toler could have played the role in his sleep . He seems so at ease with the character . The rest of the cast is enjoyable with Henry Daniell and , one of my favorites , Douglass Dumbrille standing out in support . Another bonus for Castle in the Desert is that Victor Sen Yung as # 2 son Jimmy Chan isn't anywhere near as annoying as he is in some of the other Chan films . Overall , Castle in the Desert is a nice finale to the Chan films at Fox . Nothing that would come later at Monogram is anywhere close to matching it . I've got no problem rating this one a strong verging on an .
Old-school , slow-burn , atmospheric horror	The Witch's Mirror is a veritable cornucopia of horror themes . Over the years , I've seen a number of very promising films ruined by an overly ambitious screenplay that tries to throw everything but the kitchen sink into the plot . Fortunately , The Witch's Mirror defies the odds and most of varied plot elements work . The movie is sort of a mixture of an Italian Gothic ghost story ( like Riccardo Freda's The Ghost ) and a brilliant surgeon turned mad scientist film ( like Georges Franju's Eyes Without a Face ) with a dash of grave robbing and devil worshipping . The fact that director Chano Urueta was able to combine all of these elements into an entertaining movie and effectively keep distractive plot holes to a minimum is amazing . As my examples would seem to indicate , while The Witch's Mirror is a Mexican made film , it has a definite European feel to it . And like its European counterparts , Urueta was able to effectively fill The Witch's Mirror with atmosphere to burn . If you're looking for that old-school , slow-burn , atmospheric type of horror , you can't go wrong with The Witch's Mirror .
" Once the door is locked , there is no way out . "	Frederick Loren ( Vincent Price ) is a wealthy man with some strange ideas about throwing a party . He rents a supposed haunted house , invites five strangers , and offers them each $10 , 000 if they can make it through the night . But when Loren's wife ends up at the wrong end of a noose , the fun's over ( or is really just beginning ) . Is a killer loose in the house or is the House on Haunted Hill really haunted ? You know what I enjoy the most about older horror movies like House on Haunted Hill ? they were made at a time when horror movies could still be fun . Ridiculous looking heads could pop out of suitcases , unexplained hands could grope from behind walls , and skeletons ruled the cellar . Sure , it was all unrealistic , but was it ever a blast . And that's exactly what keeps me coming back to movies like House on Haunted Hill ? that sense of fun . Today's horror movies are too realistic , try too hard to be one big gross out , and have lost most of the enjoyable elements of old . One big plus for House on Haunted Hill is the cast . Well , not all the cast , but the movie does feature a couple of outstanding , memorable performances . Horror icon Vincent Price was just getting his feet wet in the genre in 1959 . He may not have been the scene-chewing , over-the-top actor that most of us remember so fondly , but he was still rock solid in the role of the wealthy Frederick Loren . Almost as good is Carol Ohmart . Whether playing the victim or the victimizer , she's equally adept . As for the rest of the cast , the less said the better . I know we're supposed to identify with and root for the characters played by Carolyn Craig and Richard Long , but they're both so annoying that I always want to see both take a swim in the acid bath . Finally , what comment about House on Haunted Hill would be complete without a mention of the scene with the old lady in the basement . The horror in most of House on Haunted Hill may have been played for laughs , but when the hag in the cellar pops up , it's one of the best jump scares in the history of horror . I've seen the movie a dozen or more times and I know when the scene is coming up , but it still works .
Trashy and fun	She's lost her boyfriend , she's failing her classes at school , and she has no money . What's Kim Bentley to do ? The answer is obvious ? become a hooker . But sex for money is just the first step for this high school student . In no time at all , she's a contract killer . Writing about Malibu High is difficult . On the one hand , the movie is incredibly trashy and has no real redeeming characteristics whatsoever . It's all so sleazy . A high school student turned prostitute turned killer ? it's almost repulsive . However , on the other hand , Malibu High is a blast . Some of what I found enjoyable may have been unintentional , but the movie is just too much fun . A high school student turned prostitute turned killer ? how awesome is that ? Malibu High is low-budget film-making at its best ( or worst as the case may be ) . The production values are bottom of the barrel . Lighting , sound , sets , etc . are laughably bad . Much of the music is so inappropriate that it's often hysterical . My favorite had to be the theme from The People's Court playing during the film's climatic chase scene . The acting . . . what's the point ? It's terrible too . Finally , one thing in Malibu High that cracked me up repeatedly was the reaction that almost every male character had to Kim Bentley . The guys in this movie must not get out much if they consider her a hottie . There's a scene with Kim going into school in all of her slump-shouldered , figure-less glory . The cat calls had me in stitches .
Brutal and Sadistic	Talk about an adrenaline rush ! High Tension is an adrenaline junkie's wet dream . After the first 15 minutes ( which are absolutely necessary to set-up what follows ) , the movie is a kick-to-the-balls thrill ride that rarely lets up . There's a reason the movie is called High Tension ? Director Alexandre Aja ratchets the tension and suspense to eleven . It's a sadistic , brutal , blood-spattered good time . It's the kind of horror movie that in recent years has been sadly missing from the local multiplexes with their offering of PG-13 family friendly horror . The death scenes are graphic and disturbing . The victims do not spout one-liners just before being butchered . Instead , we see real horror on their faces . The acting , especially Cecile De France as Marie , is far superior to what I see in a lot of modern horror . It's an amazing performance . In short , High Tension is horror made the way horror should be made . But then comes the twist ? ? I have changed my rating on High Tension three or four times . I can't decide how mad I am about the twist . I'm not upset that the movie had a twist , I just don't care for how it was handled . I don't know why people seem surprised that the makers of High Tension would resort to a twist ending . In today's horror / thriller climate , the twist seems to be " The Thing " . Every movie-maker seems to be trying to outdo M . Night Shamalamadingdong . Whether the decision to include a twist hurt the movie is open to interpretation . For me , the twist itself had little bearing on my enjoyment of the movie . But based on other comments I've read , it's clear that most people are in agreement ? High Tension would have been a great movie without the twist . It's going to be very difficult , but I will attempt to explain my problems with the twist without giving away too much . Because of that , some of what I'm about to write may not be as clear as I would have hoped . As I said , it's not that I mind the twist per se ; it's just the way it's handled . While I have rationalized many of the perceived plot holes in the movie , there are still a few that cannot make any sense given the twist . You simply cannot have a scene in a movie that is simultaneously told from the perspective of both on-screen participants . A perfect example is the scene with Marie and Alex in the back of the truck . That scene as presented only makes sense if it were being told from the POV of both characters . One person alone would not have had that perspective . It's ridiculous to assume it could . Aja is trying to have his cake and eat it too by using these multiple POVs within the same scene . It's cheating . Even with the twist , I was tempted to do something I rarely do after a first viewing ? rate the movie a . But as I sat and thought about the movie and tried to wrap my mind around the twist , I realized there were problems I wasn't willing to overlook . In the end , I've still rated High Tension a . That rating is subject to change given repeat viewings and my ever-changing feelings toward the twist . Regardless of the rating , it's one of the best , recently made horror films I've seen .
" Wicked men , you face The Tick . "	Somehow , I missed The Tick during its run on television . Thank goodness for DVD ! The Tick has to be one of the funniest , most original shows I've seen . It's a riot ! I can't believe there are only eight episodes . I can pinpoint two things that make The Tick so good to me . First , the writing . Some of the dialogue in The Tick is laugh out loud funny . In the pilot episode , the first time we see the Tick , he's guarding a bus stop . His main enemy appears to be the coffee machine that has a habit of taking money from customers . I'll never forget the sight of the Tick shaking the coffee machine while saying " Armless bandit . . . Empty your bladder of that bitter black urine men call coffee ! It has its price and its price has been payed ! Java devil , you are now my bitch . " Hysterical ! The second area where the show excels is in the casting . Going back to his days on the television show Dave's World , I've always thought that Patrick Warburton was one the funniest people I've ever seen . He's a big , tough , good-looking guy who can be as goofy as they come . He is simply perfect in the title role of this series . His delivery , mannerism , attitude , and look are dead on . I can't imagine anyone else playing the Tick . As for the rest of the cast , they're wonderful . As much as I can't imagine anyone else playing the Tick , I feel even stronger about David Burke in the role of Arthur . He IS Arthur . Liz Vassey and Nestor Carbonell are the two other regulars rounding out this superb cast . It's a shame The Tick didn't last longer . Eight episodes hardly seems like enough .
" To be right all the time might get a bit monotonous . "	Richard Abernethie , a very wealthy man , has died and his relatives have assembled for his funeral . Included in the funeral party is Abernathie's youngest sister Cora Galaccio . While none of the family has seen Cora in at least 20 years , they all agree that Cora was always a bit different . So when Cora says something about Abemethie having been murdered , most laugh it off as one of Cora's eccentricities . But someone is obviously taking Cora seriously . The next day , Cora is found dead in her bed having been beaten violently . Is there a connection between the two deaths ? It's up to Hercule Poirot to find a killer . After the Funeral is one of the most well put together episodes of the entire Poirot series . I've always been a fan of this particular Agatha Christie book and , from what I remember , the movie is as faithful to Christie's source material as any of the Poirot installments . The mystery is top notch with plenty of clues , suspects , and red herrings . And as I've written before , I always enjoy an Christie story where Hercule Poirot gathers everyone together in a drawing room for the final reveal . It might be old fashioned , but that's the way I like it . Getting beyond the plot , technically and artistically After the Funeral is a winner . Sets , editing , direction , and cinematography are as good as you'll find in one of these movies . The acting is equally impressive . I've come to expect an enjoyable performance from David Suchet as Poirot and he doesn't disappoint here . The rest of the cast is just as strong with Monica Dolan giving an especially noteworthy performance . Other than a minor quibble with the rapid fire way the characters are introduced , I've got no real complaints . It's a good show all the way around .
Very Nice	- Over the past few months , I've watched three non-traditional vampire movies - Martin , Daughters of Darkness , and , now , Vampyres . These aren't your black-cape-wearing , fanged , turn-into-bats type of vampires . Instead , these vampires rely on luring an unsuspecting victim with their charms and , when the time is right , cutting them open to drink their blood . The vampires in Vampyres display a real viciousness when faced with blood . In all other respects , they appear to be quite normal . - Vampyres features some wonderful atmosphere . The old castle is a perfect setting for this kind of movie . Although we only see a couple of the rooms ( due more than likely to budget restraints ) , both are ideal for a vampire's lair . While some of the acting is less than perfect , it's never a distraction . The music is wonderful . The theme that plays over the titles is haunting and vicious at the same time . And , while there is a considerable amount of sex and nudity , it never feels out of place . After all , it's the preferred method in Vampyres to trap a victim . - There are one or two plot points that make little sense . One that really bothers me is near the beginning of the movie when a future victim is checking-in to the local inn . The innkeeper goes on and on about knowing him and how he had stayed there before . The man claims that the innkeeper is mistaken . What's that all about ? Why go through this scene of mistaken identity and never bring it up again ? What's the point ? Oh well , it's a small scene and easily overlooked .
Solid Columbo	- One of the better Columbo movies I've seen thus far . The mystery is intelligent and the killer's actions are what you would expect from a doctor . The mystery will keep you guessing up to the last scene . Often , these Columbo movies have a less than satisfactory ending . It's as if the writers too often had no idea how to end the thing and resort to having the killer confess when faced with the flimsiest of evidence . That's not the case here . The evidence , when finally presented , is damning and leaves no doubt about the doctor's guilt . - Leonard Nimoy makes an excellent advisory for Peter Falk's Columbo . He is essentially playing Mr . Spock - calm , rational , and intelligent . Even with faced with Columbo's erratic behavior , he never loses his cool . In fact , this is one of the few episodes where I remember Columbo losing it . In one scene , he slams a clock to the desk and let's the unflappable Nimoy have it . It's a very uncharacteristic moment for Columbo , but only proves he's human like the rest of us . - The only real weakness I see in the movie is the decision to cast Will Geer as the head of an important research project . Maybe I saw the Waltons too many times while growing up , but Geer is too kindly and simple to be my ideal choice to play such an important doctor and researcher .
" If it bleeds , we can kill it . "	Watching Predator tonight , I was reminded of what an awesome decade the 1980s were for mindless , over-the-top , fun action . Predator is easily one of my favorites from the decade . Over the past few years , I've re-watched a number of my old 1980s favorites and none of them have withstood the test of time as well as Predator . The movie quite simply has it all ? the guns , the explosions , the biceps , the jungle setting , the quips ( used sparingly , thank goodness ) , the blood , and the unstoppable enemy . But most importantly , it's got Arnold . In my mind , Schwarzenegger IS 80s action . The plot isn't overly complicated or doesn't get in the way . It's there to set up the action . The movie begins with a band of mercenaries going into an undisclosed Latin American country to rescue a couple of hostages . But there are more than the enemy guerrillas in this jungle . A strange being from another world is using this particular jungle as a base for his hunting expedition . His prey ? humans . Predator has held up over the years because of the superb and unrelenting action . It's a testosterone overload . In addition to Schwarzenegger , guys like Jesse Ventura , Carl Weathers , and Bill Duke fit nicely into the jungle setting . Every imaginable hand-held type military weapon is used at some point in the movie . No scene illustrates this quite like the one where Arnold and crew fire indiscriminately into the jungle as limbs , brush , and entire trees are knocked down from the sheer volume of their fire . Awesome stuff ! Another big plus is the actual creature . The Predator design is fantastic . From his glowing eyes and blood to his use of camouflage to his array of weapons , he's one bad dude . I also appreciate the fact that a lot of time wasn't devoted to the alien's back-story . He is what he is . The only real weakness I can come up with in the entire movie is the acting . But really , who watches a movie like Predator expecting to see Oscar caliber performances ?
" Human nature has an infinite capacity to surprise . "	Finally ! I've now seen all of the feature length installments of the Poirot movies featuring David Suchet . And wouldn't you know it ? the last one I watch just happens to be one of the best of the entire series . Five Little Pigs , which happens to benefit from staying fairly true to Agatha Christie's original work ( at least as best as I can remember ) , is a poignant , gut-wrenching , and beautifully filmed movie . As Christie did in her novel , the mystery is told though a series of five interviews that flashback to that fateful day when a murder was committed . Director Paul Unwin handles this portion quite nicely . I was worried about all the hand-held shaky-cam , but it works well for the iffy memories of events of fourteen years previous . Even though I knew the outcome , I thought the mystery elements were well done . I think someone without knowledge of the plot would really enjoy this part of Five Little Pigs . The acting , other than the abysmal performance of Aimee Mullins as the adult Lucy , is more than acceptable . By now ( or by 2003 at least ) , Suchet has grown in the role of Poirot to the point that I cannot imagine anyone else even attempting to do the character . Two other real highlights for me were the music ( it's quite beautiful ) and the photography ( there are some gorgeous landscape shots throughout the movie ) . All together , an seems about right by me . Had the adult Lucy not been so distractingly poorly played , I could have easily rated Five Little Pigs higher .
My favorite Franco	- Jimmy Logan ( James Darren ) , a trumpet player in a jazz band , is secretly in love with Wanda Reed ( Maria Rohm ) . One night , he witnesses her being tortured and raped by three people . Some time later , Jimmy pulls Wanda's body from the surf . In a distraught state , Jimmy heads to Rio and starts playing music again . Jimmy is surprised one night to see Wanda walk into the party where he is playing . Soon , those responsible for Wanda's death end up dying mysteriously . Is it really Wanda ? Jimmy is certain that Wanda is dead . - I am by no means a Franco expert - I've only seen six or seven of his films . But , Venus in Furs is by far the best I've seen . The other Franco films I've seen have very confusing plots and characters whose motivation is questionable at best . Some of those films were also hampered by less than stellar cinematography and editing . This is not the case here . Venus in Furs has a very compelling , thought provoking story . Most everything makes sense within the framework of the movie . And the ending will leave an impression in your mind for days after you've watched the movie . There are no problems with the editing . And the cinematography is simply beautiful . Everything from the stage the band plays on with the red background to the inviting shots of Istanbul are a real treat to the eye . - Other than his appearance in The Guns of Navarone , I had only seen James Darren in fairly lightweight fluff like Gidget . When I saw he was in the film , I was at first a little apprehensive . But after watching Venus in Furs , I can't imagine anyone else in the lead role . And , Maria Rohm is simply mesmerizing as Wanda . She has an otherworld quality that's perfect for the role . - While Venus in Furs may be classified as a horror movie , don't expect a lot of in your face gore or any other such mayhem . The horror is very subtle , but effective . There is any uneasy sense of morbidity just under the surface . While each of the deaths feature relatively little actual violence , the tension and atmosphere leading up to each is undeniable . - While I may have been leery at first of buying Venus in Furs , it's now a very welcome addition to my DVD collection .
" We're sisters under the mink . "	A policeman commits suicide and everyone in the department seems content to let it go . Everyone , that is , except Det . Sgt . Dave Bannion ( Glenn Ford ) . Bannion starts asking some tough questions and sticks his nose where it doesn't belong . Bannion knows he's on the right trail when one of the people he spoke with turns up dead . But when the violence gets a little closer to home , things change for Bannion . It gets personal . Just about everything works in this movie as I'm sure director Fritz Lang intended . Interesting plot , gorgeous cinematography , terrific acting , fantastic writing , great atmosphere , believable character motivation , etc . etc . etc . All highlights of The Big Heat for me . There's really nothing significant to complain about . But I suppose I was most impressed with Gloria Grahame . I cannot imagine anyone doing more with or being better in the role of Debby Marsh as Grahame is . Innocent , tough , frightened , street-smart ? you name , she played it . And usually to perfection . She literally steals every scene in which she appears . And in the end , well , I don't want to give anything away , but Grahame's final scenes are amazing .
Pam Grier is Amazing	- Foxy Brown is a great example of the Blaxplotation films made in the 1970s . It's a product of its time and ( even though a remake is in the works ) could not be made today . The PC crowd would go nuts if such a movie were released in 2005 . - Foxy Brown is the story of a woman looking for revenge after her boyfriend is gunned down in front of her house . She's not going to let anyone , not even her brother , stand in the way of her mission . - Foxy Brown works primarily because of two key ingredients - Pam Grier and Jack Hill . After watching just a few minutes , it's easy to forget that your watching Grier and , instead , think you are really watching Foxy . Grier is perfect as Foxy . I honestly can't imagine anyone else in the role . She's one of those smart , tough , caring , and honest characters that you don't often , unfortunately , see being played by a black woman . She is the ultimate in her own butt-kicking , outfit-changing , pulling-a gun-from-her-afro kind of way . - As for Jack Hill , he was able to make a movie on a very tight , limited budget that looks much larger than it really is . There are a few instances where you would have liked to see Hill do a re-shoot , but for the most part , the movie's flaws are not obvious .
" I've had this brain for thirty years . It hasn't done me any good ! "	Abbott and Costello get mixed up with a mad doctor , Count Dracula , Frankenstein's monster , and the Wolf Man . It seems that Dracula , with the assistance of the doctor , wants to cure the monster by finding him a new brain . Larry Talbot , the Wolf Man's alter ego , intends to put a stop to these monstrous experiments . And just where does Dracula think he'll find a new brain ? That's where Abbott and Costello come in . There was a time when I thought this was the best film that Abbott and Costello ever made . Back in the 70s , I can remember this movie playing in the afternoons and I couldn't wait to get home from school to watch it . As I've seen more and more of their films , I realize that while it may no longer be my favorite , it's still a very good example of their work . If you're so inclined , you can read positive , glowing reviews for Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein all over the internet . I doubt I could add very much to what's already been written , so I'm not really going to try . I'll just mention a couple of my favorite scenes - the boys ' argument with the museum owner and Costello strapped to the gurney . Both are comedy gold and never fail to bring a smile to my face . But as I said , the movie is not longer my favorite Abbott and Costello film . The reason I no longer think as highly of Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein as I once did is my problem with the way Dracula is presented . Frankenstein's monster is still the hulking nightmare of Universal's earlier films . Larry Talbot is still the same brooding " woe is me " character he always was . But Dracula is presented more as a parody of himself than a figure to be frightened of . He comes across more like the actor , Bela Lugosi , than the undead bloodsucker he really is . Many of Dracula's lines and scenes are just plain ridiculous given the character's history . Even with my growing distaste for the handling of Dracula , Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein is still a film that I enjoy revisiting whenever I get the opportunity .
" Before I kill you , I'm going to throw your baby out the window . "	Almost 40 years ago , the San Francisco area was terrorized by a crazed killer known only as Zodiac . He committed what seems to have been a series of cold-blooded , but random murders . He would follow-up the killings with letters sent to the police and newspapers that taunted them with clues and cryptograms that promised to reveal his identity . He claims to have killed a dozen or so people . But after years of activity , the Zodiac disappeared . Though some feel they know Zodiac's true identity , the case has never been officially solved . David Fincher's movie Zodiac is the story of this famous but dark period of American history and presents on possible solution to the mystery of the Zodiac . Having recently done some reading on the Zodiac killer , I decided it was high time I checked out Fincher's movie . I was well aware of some of Fincher's other work but I hadn't read much about Zodiac , so I wasn't sure exactly what to expect . Also , given the quality of some of the other movies made about real life serial killers , I tried not to get my hopes up too high . Overall , I'm very impressed . Zodiac is an intelligent , thrilling , well-written piece of cinema with some very good performances . If you're looking for a thrill-a-minute ride , you'll be disappointed . While some of the Zodiac's murders are shown in detail , they are not the focus of the movie . Instead , the investigation by the police and the reporters is central to Zodiac's plot . In a comment on IMDb , I read the comparison between Zodiac and All the President's Men and couldn't agree more . The obsession of Woodward and Bernstein to get to the bottom of Watergate is very similar to that of Robert Graysmith as he hunts for the elusive killer . Some may call it slow or even dull , but having an attention span longer than 30 seconds , I found it very exciting . While I've done a little research on the Zodiac case , I'm far from an expert . But from what little I do know , I appreciate how well the movie sticks with the facts of the case . I'm sure those more well versed in the subject would be more qualified to respond to this , but I noted very few instances of creative liberties being taken with the material . And most of those instances seem to come from Graysmith's novel and were not made by those responsible for the movie . And I'm impressed with the way Fincher was able to take these known facts and create such an entertaining movie . Even though I knew the outcome and what was going to happen next , Fincher puts so much style and atmosphere into the movie that it's predictability with me hardly mattered . I was literally on the edge of my seat . It's a well directed movie . Finally , I cannot end this without singling out some the acting as a real bright spot of Zodiac . Jake Gyllenhaal , Robert Downey , Jr . , Anthony Edwards , and everyone else involved did a wonderful job . In fact , I cannot think of a single actor that I didn't enjoy . But as good as every performer was , I was most impressed with Mark Ruffalo as Inspector David Toschi . I bought his character completely . It's quite simply a brilliant performance .
Anubis goes for a walk	In this episode of Jonny Quest , Dr . Quest is summoned to Egypt by a supposed old friend , Dr . Ali Kareem , to take a look at his latest archaeological find . But Dr . Kareem has other plans in mind for Dr . Quest and family - and they don't include sightseeing . Dr . Kareem is behind the recent theft of the mask of Anubis . He hopes to pin the theft on Dr . Quest so that his plans might be fulfilled . Unknown to Dr . Kareem ( or Dr . Quest for that matter ) , however , the mummy Anubis has come to life and is searching the countryside for his lost possession . I can just imagine that someone smarter than me might take a look at " The Curse of Anubis " and write an essay about the unflattering portrayal of Middle Easterners by Westerners . Or they might write about the significance Dr . Ali Kareem's ramblings calling for a unified Arab state . But you won't get that from me . I've never watched an episode of Jonny Quest and come away with the un-PC notions some other viewers seem to . For me , it's all about the mummy Anubis as he makes his slow march across the desert . " The Curse of Anubis " features one of my absolute favorite moments from Jonny Quest . It might not sound like much , but the sight of Anubis standing on the dune with the moon in the background as his tattered bandages flap in the breeze ? Wow ! I loved it as a kid and still think it's a great sight . The biggest weakness I see in this episode is with the ambiguity of Dr . Kareem's plans . Don't ask me what those plans are because Dr . Kareem's thinking makes very little sense to me .
Compelling	The Most Beautiful Wife is the kind of movie I usually avoid . I usually don't go for these overly depressing tales . But The Most Beautiful Wife is oddly compelling and drew me in from the start . The film is based on a true story and deals with the barbaric treatment of women ( who am I kidding , these are girls ) at the hands of their future husbands . Rape was an acceptable means of forcing a marriage . No other man would want the woman as she was no longer a virgin . But as depressing as the subject matter may be , director Damiano Damiani and cinematographer Franco Di Giacomo created an incredibly lovely film with The Most Beautiful Wife . The contrast between the green , lush farm lands and the crumbling city scenes is pleasing . And Ennio Morricone's score is what I've come to expect ? a work of genius . It suits the film perfectly . Ornella Muti gives a terrific performance in the title role . And when you consider that this was her first film and that she was only 14 years old , it makes all the more amazing . As the whole film is centered around her and as she is the focal point of almost every scene , it's imperative that her performance be believable if The Most Beautiful Wife has a chance at all to work . She pulls it off flawlessly . I doubt an actress twice her age with years of experience could have done any better . It's an impressive piece of work .
" As a villain , you were awesome . As a hero , you're a sentimental fool . "	When a blond warrior claiming to be Xena begins killing innocent people , the real Xena and sidekick Gabrielle decide they must do something to put a stop to it . The mysterious killer turns out to be Callisto , a woman who has known nothing but hatred for Xena all of her life . Callisto blames Xena for the death of her family and has vowed to destroy Xena and everything she holds dear . The introduction of Xena's nemesis Callisto is easily one of the highlights of the series ' entire run . Xena is the Ying to Callisto's Yang ? they're oil and water ? they're sweet and sour ? they're any tired old cliché you can think of . But when they're together , it's fantastic ! Their fight scenes are wonderfully entertaining . The ladder battle in the episode titled " Callisto " is one of the best the show ever presented ( and that's a lot of fight scenes ) . Fortunately for fans of the show , the producers saw fit to bring Callisto back season after season ? even after she had been killed several times over . But it's this meeting , their first , that I find extra-special . I think much of credit for the success of the Xena / Callisto relationship has to go to Hudson Leick . The hatred she expresses with her eyes , the contempt conveyed through her body , and the snarl of her voice ? it's all so real . You can all but feel the venom she spews forth . It's almost palatable . Answering Xena's question about what she would do if she were set free , Callisto answers , " You let me go , and I'll dedicate my life to killing everything you love . Your friends , your family , your reputation - even your horse . " Now that's hatred !
" I was born ready ! "	White Lightning is a terrific action / drama that tells the story of a hard-driving moonshiner named Gator McKlusky ( Burt Reynolds ) who is released from prison early in exchange for any help he can give the government with its case against his fellow moonshiners . Gator , however , has his own agenda and it has nothing to do with his altruistic nature . It seems that Sheriff J . C . Connors ( Ned Beatty ) of Bogen County is not only one of the biggest moonshiners in Arkansas , he's also responsible for killing Gator's brother . And Gator wants revenge . One of the coolest things about White Lightning is that it presents Burt Reynolds as an actor at the top of his game . This was a Burt Reynolds who seemed to actually care about the final product and not just yucking it up with his buddies on screen . White Lightning was made before Burt became a clown , mugging for the camera . That's not to say there isn't any humor in White Lightning ? it's just used judiciously . Burt is joined by phenomenal cast . In addition to Ned Beatty ( who's perfect as the Sheriff ) , R . G . Armstrong , Bo Hopkins , Diane Lane , and Dabbs Greer give solid , memorable performances . In fact , I can't think of a single actor that bothered me . The movie was helped tremendously by the decision to film in rural Arkansas . I grew-up in the South and everything from the locations to the sweat dripping off Burt's chin had a feeling of authenticity . I've been to places like the old Kroger I spotted in the background and I sweat just like Burt in the oppressively hot Southern summers . It all felt real to me . Finally , the plot is just terrific , mixing in just the right amount of high speed car chases , brutal looking fight scenes , and dramatic conversations . It drew me in right from the start and held my attention throughout . Overall , it's a well-made , entertaining movie .
Shockingly Good	I had heard good things about The Sadist , but to be honest , I was skeptical . I haven't seen everything listed on Arch Hall , Jr . ' s filmography , but I've been less than impressed with what I have seen . Like a lot of other people , I am shocked by just how good The Sadist truly is . It's a wonderfully sick and twisted tale with tons of suspense and tension . There's an undeniable atmosphere of menace in almost every scene . I might not think much of Arch Hall , Jr . , but he's perfect in the role of the crazed Charlie Tibbs . Think of him and his girlfriend as a 60's version of Mickey and Mallory from Natural Born Killers . It's the same kind of ruthless , almost gleeful , lack of respect for human life . It's good stuff and definitely one of the better public domain type films I've run across . Finally , I'm amazed that this is the only film credit listed for Helen Hovey ( Arch's cousin ) . I thought she played the vulnerable , frightened character quite well . I would have liked to see her in some other movies .
My Favorite Fulci	Lucio Fulci may be best known for his zombie splatter-fests and that's a shame because he's really so much more than that . If you see the name Fulci and expect a gore-fest , you'll be disappointed . This one is even more bloodless than his other Gialli . But if you want a solid Italian thriller , you've discovered a real winner . I have no reservations about placing One on Top of the Other near the top of the list of the 60-odd Gialli I've seen . One on Top of the Other actually features very few , if any , horror elements . Instead , the movie focuses on two of the other Giallo trademarks ? sleaze and mystery . And Fulci does a fantastic job with both . As for the sleaze , there's probably more nudity and sex in this movie than in Fulci's A Lizard in a Woman's Skin and Don't Torture a Duckling combined . As for the mystery elements , Fulci fills the film with enough red herrings and other mystery tricks for two or three movies . I was completely engrossed and entertained form the opening credits . Solid cinematography , nice San Francisco locations , an outstanding Riz Ortolani score , above average acting , and Marisa Mell make One on Top of the Other a new favorite of mine . My only complaint ( and it is admittedly a small one ) is the amount of screen time showing the film's protagonist sitting on death row waiting to die . A little tighter editing during this 10 or so minute segment might have helped make One on Top of the Other the best Giallo I've ever seen . I mentioned Marisa Mell in the opening paragraph and if you're a fan , you owe it to yourself to track down a copy of One on Top of the Other . She never looked better and I've never seen so much of her . Her motorcycle striptease scene is worth the price of admission . Check it out ! Come on , Anchor Bay ? give us that Region 1 release !
I can't believe it took me 41 years to see this movie	- Considering all of the movies I've watched in my life , it's amazing I had never seen Laura . The film mixes an interesting story , excellent cinematography , solid acting , and characters you're not likely to forget to create a bona fide classic . I'm not an expert , but Laura is certainly one of the best examples of the film noir that I've thus far seen . Most every character in the movie has some tragic flaw . As for the story , I found the mystery of who killed Laura to be secondary to the interaction between the characters . They speak to each other in that wonderful way that only characters in a film noir speak . This is a definite must see that I look forward to revisiting time and time again . - While I previously praised the characters in Laura , they also represent the only real weakness I see in the film that keeps me from rating it a . The characters are a little too exaggerated . Det . Lt . Mark McPherson ( Dana Andrews ) is a little to solemn and non-feeling . The gold-digging , but penniless , playboy Shelby Carpenter ( Vincent Price ) is a little too conniving . And , although certainly one of the most memorable characters I've ever seen , Waldo Lydecker ( Clifton Webb ) is a little too flamboyant ( for lack of a better word ) . I don't know , but it's possible that these exaggerated characters were part of Preminger's plan . Regardless , the over-the-top characterizations can be a bit distracting .
" You can clean up the mess , but don't touch my coffin . "	Django is the film that turned me on to Spaghetti Westerns beyond those made by Sergio Leone . From the moment I saw Franco Nero dragging that coffin through the mud , I was a fan . And it's lost nothing regardless of how many times I see it . Django is ultra-cool , ultra-violent , and way over-the-top . What the film lacks in originality , it more than makes up for with some of the sweetest set-pieces the genre has to offer . Take the scene where Django finally opens that ever present coffin . The sight of Django mowing down dozens of red-masked baddies is one of those moments I watch movies for . The direction , acting , music , locations , and just about everything else you can name are dead-on perfect as far as I'm concerned . My only real complaint , and this really has nothing to do with Sergio Corbucci or Nero , is the dubbing . The voice used for Django is about as lifeless as they come . Even in the most exciting of moments , that monotone voice never waivers . Django is one of the examples I use when discussing the genius of Corbucci and his place in the history of the genre . I've often argued that if it weren't for Leone , Corbucci would be known as the Father of the Spaghetti Western . His films like Django , The Great Silence , Companeros , and The Hellbenders are required viewing for fans of Spaghetti Westerns .
" It's a mad house . A mad house . "	I have always found it easier to write about the junky , cheesy movies I watch than it is to write about why a certain movie works flawlessly with me . I find that I enjoy my favorite movies for personal reasons that are difficult to put into words . For me , Planet of the Apes is one of those flawless movies . Everything works perfectly ? the plot , the acting , the special effects , the locations , and the action . Charlton Heston is an actor who could chew the scenery with the best of Hollywood . But in Planet of the Apes , it works for me because for long stretches of the movie , he's the only human with a line of dialogue . The movie might have become dull with an actor with less of a screen presence . The ape makeup is fantastic . Like a lot of fans of the movie , I went to see Tim Burton's re-imaging . And while the apes may have looked more ape-like , I'll take Roddy McDowell in a latex mask any day . The music is otherworldly brilliant and fits every scene . Oh , I could go on and on for pages , but I'll stop here . As I said , it's difficult for me to explain why I enjoy Planet of the Apes so much , I just know that I wouldn't change a thing . There are certain images and moments in Planet of the Apes that will always stick with me . I look forward to revisiting them each time I get the chance to re-watch the movie . The final scene is iconic and needs no further explanation . Other favorite bits from the movie include : the " hear no evil , see no evil , speak no evil " courtroom scene , Heston trapped in the net , and Heston's goodbye kiss with Zira . But one of my favorite moments is the first images of the gorillas on horseback . Heston and a few other humans are in the cornfields crotched low . A horse and rider gallop past and make a quick turn . The rider's face comes into frame and we see not a man , but an ape . It's an amazing moment in cinema !
One of the coolest Jonny Quest episodes	The Quests pay a visit to Dr . Ashida , an old friend of Dr . Benton Quest's . Dr . Ashida has been doing research with the Tobura lizard . As a result of his research , he has been able to grow the lizards into 14 ' man-eating dragons . And if Dr . Ashida and his dragons weren't enough , the Quest Team will have to deal with a mountain of a man known as Sumi . Thinking back to my childhood , there are three episodes of Jonny Quest that really standout . The Robot Spy , The House of Seven Gargoyles , and this one , The Dragons of Ashida , are a big part of the reason that Jonny Quest has such a special place in my memories . It's just so cool ! The Dragons of Ashida has a lot going for it . Dr . Ashida is a madman of the first order . He's quite capable of doing anything ( which results in his ultimate downfall ) . And the way he's drawn ? he even looks evil . The dragons themselves scared me at one time . Today I look at them and marvel at their detail , especially in the final chase scene . Last , there's Sumi . Just he sight of an overpowering , one-eyed , bald Sumo wrestler was ( and still is ) amazing . With danger around every corner , two of the most vicious baddies the Quests ever faced , and the threat of ending up dragon food makes The Dragons of Ashida a winner .
