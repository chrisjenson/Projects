They Got The Bias In Quickly Here	It didn't take long before the typical Christian-bashing began in this cheap sleazy horror film . Right off the bat , a man is desperately pleading with his neighbor to answer the door and let him in , that his life is in danger . He's begging the neighbor . The guy inside is a Christian . The man outside shouts , " What kind of Christian are you ? " He isn't let in , and minutes later is killed . Here we go - one more example of a needless religious cheap shot by filmmakers , as a Christian is shown in a negative , hypercritical light . Take that , and ridiculous profanity which includes 10 usage's of the Lord's name in vain in the first hour , and this pumpkin VHS was hurled in the garbage can .
Laugh Tracks Are An Insult To The Viewer	An annoying narrator and - worse - a laugh track begins this cartoon on a sour note . The narrator is chastising the Pink Panther for lying around , not doing anything . He suggests going to the basement , getting some tools and making something . There is some unfunny gag with the light switch and then the Panther saws part of his house off as a buzz saw goes out of control . The Panther pouts lies down on is bed , but once again is chastised . This time , the aggravating narrator suggest fixing leaky shower facet rather than spending big bucks hiring a plumber . Of course , that doesn't go right , either . Having a laugh track on a cartoon , for cryin ' out loud , is ridiculous and an insult to every viewer . . . . as if telling us when we should laugh . Worse , this cartoon wasn't funny in the first place . This might be the worst Pink Panther animated short I've ever seen .
' Clueless ' Is Correct	This was " cute " for a while and then became too teener-bopper oriented for me . I guess if you are a 13-16-year-old female , you'd relate and like this film . Sad to say , it's another film which gives poor messages to teens . Hey , kids . . . . want to have casual sex ? No problem . . . . go for it ! Nice . Leave it the ultra - - Liberal and moral bankrupt world of film making . Clueless is a good title for people who make films like this , not just the lead character in the movie . According to Hollywood , being a teen - as shown in this movie - - revolves only around your social life , plastic surgery , cellphones , drugs and sex . It's all made nice and surgery by having the pretty and sweet-looking Alice Silverstone in the lead . She plays the not-so - - sweet " Cher , " an apt name for materialistic , spoiled brat . When the messages are , for example , virginity is bad , but drugs are okay , even fun to experiment . This tale of teen matchmaking and other topics that will make an adult want to puke , does have a decent cast with always-interesting guys like Dan Hedeya and Wallace Shawn and another young " hottie " in Brittany Murphy . However , you wouldn't want your kids to watch this garbage , believe me . Overall , the title says is all .
Little To Like From Spike	For the longest time , it has been - or was - politically-incorrect to criticize director Spike Lee , so he gets away with murder in a number of his overrated films . Lee , in his obnoxiousness because of this fawning , doesn't care or doesn't get it that most of America doesn't want to go to a film that has over 300 profanities in it and tons of drugs and violence . If he only cares about appeasing his crowd , okay , but that doesn't mean I have to like or praise everything he does , like Roger Ebert and the rest of them . For the uniformed - and we're better off , in this case - " clockers " is a ghetto term for " drug runners or dealers . " In this story , it's drug dealers and cops , innocent people and thugs and an investigation ( is Mekhi Phifer's " Strike " guilty or innocent ? ) to get it all sorted out . Unfortunately , it takes too long for all of this to happen . In between the million f-words , and more preaching by the racist director , you have to put up with music that was so loud it drowned out the dialog a number of times . Maybe that wasn't so bad .
This'Short ' About Sleep Will Do Just That	Robert Benchley discusses the subject of sleep in four parts : 1 - the causes of sleep ; 2 - the methods of inducing sleep ; 3 - methods of avoiding sleep and , finally , 4 - how to wake up ( " which is the most important , " he notes . ) Early on this showed promise to a funny " short , " but it really wasn't . After five or six minutes , it got simply boring . The third segment comprised most of the overall time and went on way too long . Yes , some of it was mildly amusing , mainly the names he put to various sleepng positions , but that's about it . Actually , as someone who has a lot of trouble sleeping , it was amazing : this short film almost put me to sleep !
Another Loser For Lithgow	What a disappointment ! With a title like that , I expected something really good , or at least fun to watch . It was neither . It was just another grimy flick with no values to it and no clarity or intelligence to the story . It was stupid and it was boring , which is about the worst thing a film can be . Come to think of it , I have never seen a good movie yet in which John Lithgow is the star , which may explain part of the reason just is so bad . Too bad , because the rest of the cast features some interesting names : Ellen Barkin , Jeff Goldblum , Christopher Lloyd and Peter Weller , but this was hardly a film these actors want in their resumes . A vastly overrated " cult " movie .
Simply Boring , Not Much Else	The only things worth watching and hearing in this French film are Emmanuelle Beart's face and some of Ravel's violin music , respectively . Otherwise , this is an incredibly boring movie ; a very long , drawn out soap opera . It's nothing but people yakking away . The fact national critics rave about this movie is mind-boggling . The film has little offer , even sleaze , which critics love . For those looking at the cover of the DVD box or VHS tape and thinking this might be some kind of erotic French film , forget it . There is no sex nor certainly anything erotic Unfortunately , this is very little worthy of anyone's attention .
In A Word : Boring	The cast was intriguing to me but the story didn't turn out to be something that kept my interest . That means it was simply too boring . Most of the movie involves people who want to get out of the draft for the Korean War , or they are a parent and they want their son out of it . Hey , this sounds like Viet Nam 15-20 years later . Anyway , between that stuff and an annoying romance between Farley Granger and Peggy Dow , this wasn't a film that entertained me . Dow's character acted as if she was too good for Granger . Overall , nothing special . There are too many other good movies to waste time watching this one .
Greedy People Not Funny	I have some Irish heritage but I'm not from Ireland . I love Irish music , like the people , like the accent . think the country is beautiful , etc . I say all this because this movie sucked , and to me made the Irish people look like idiots . Let's hope they aren't like the annoying characters in this film . In here , most of the people are money-hungry , shallow people who will do and say anything to get the riches of the Lotto . Someone in the town has just won the big lottery and they want to get in good with whomever it is . Sure , some parts are funny and it's only an exaggerated movie to get some laughs but I found the people irritating . I also don't appreciate hearing the Lord's name in vain seven times in first 20 minutes . I guess I'm an unusual Irishman in that regard . I say , stick that blasphemy in a crime movie , not a comedy .
Cute , But Just For The Tiny Tots	This was quite informative , at least first two minutes , as we are given facts about the armadillo It was pretty interesting , too . The setting is Belem , Brazil , where we next see another species , " tourista Americano , " deplane for a quick stopover . Actually we see two : Micky and Pluto . The dog sees a ball nearby ( the armadillo forms that shape while protecting itself ) and begins playing with it . Soon , the ball is the nearby jungle and it begins to cause Pluto all kinds of problems . That's basically , the gag in here : Pluto trying to deal with this strange creature who looks like a hard rubber ball , but is alive . The armadillo spends much of the cartoon batting her little eyes at Pluto , winning him over . It gets a little too repetitive . What you usually get with these old Disney cartoons is something to please the little kids , is mildly amusing for adults and looks good with bright , clean colors . This one was strictly for the little ones .
Battling Butler A Buster Bomb	The first 30 minutes of this Buster Keaton film are some of the stupidest he ever made , at least from what I've seen . I don't blame him ; this is the film world where even since this period - around 1920 - marriage is always trivialized and people are always lying . Why was that so frequent in classic movies , in particular ? It's disgusting . Here Alfred " Battling " Butler , a spoiled rich young man - in order to keep his girl - lies about being the lightweight boxing champion of the world , because that guy , who has the same name as him , is a hero and he wants to impress her and her big brother and big father . He wants to marry her right away because she's pretty and she consents as soon as she hears he's a big shot . Boy , those are great reasons for marriage ! After the quickie marriage , Buster heads off for training camp for his supposed title defense against the " Alabama Murderer . " Later , the real " Battling Butler , " to do the impostor a favor and save his marriage , lets him be the real thing and fight while he retires . The training - and the first real laugh of the film - isn't until 47-minute mark when Buster begins training and can't get over the ropes . He is helpless outside and inside the ring as it turns out . The training escalates as Buster begins roadwork the next day . . . . . but he isn't up to training or fighting or any of this . Fortunately , a big twist occurs late in the movie which saves Buster from going into the ring , although the little man does save his honor after he fights the real " Battling Butler . " I would agree with the critics on this one : it's far from Buster's best work .
Not Fun To Watch	Despite the great cast which also afforded me another opportunity to admire Ingrid Bergman's beauty , this movie wasn't nearly as appealing as I had hoped . That was because of the downer of a story . I did not find it fun to watch an innocent woman being mentally tortured for an hour , being accused of things she didn't do and slowly being driven insane . Charles Boyer is effective as the vile husband . Bergman looks best in the beginning of he film with her hair down and smiling a lot . After that , it's the opposite . The last part of the movie , when Cotten starts to investigate , is very good and saves the film somewhat . My only question - concerning the story - is why the maids aren't found guilty of conspiring with Boyer since it appears they do so , especially in Angela Lansbury's case . Overall , too depressing to watch more than once . Too many viewings of this and you'll want to take the gas pipe , not the gaslight .
Dousing Racial Fires With Gasoline	This is four short movies-in-one : four " tales , " ' so to speak . I liked the first three when I first watched this back in the mid 1990s . I did not like the fourth story . The " good " is that the stories are basically interesting and feature good sound and neat visuals . The " bad " is that they are racially-motivated and very slanted . If the roles were reserved in here - blacks and whites - people would have screamed " racism . " It's the typical double standard we have seen for awhile . Imagine if all the black people were villains and all the white people the good guys ? That's what you have here in reverse . Even on the IMDb plot line , it says the stories are " with an African American focus . " Excuse me ? ? What if it said , " made with a Caucasion American focus ? Come on , folks - stop the double-speak . Another negative is the extreme profanity , including blasphemy . Why I am not surprised that Spike Lee had a hand in this movie ? ? Those negatives sound like a typical film made by him . I really liked Clarence Williams III as the funeral parlor director spinning these stories . I thought he was consistently the best character . The punks listening to him were the worst . All four stores are horror ones and have different casts in them . All the villains were white racists . Do you think these stories help race relations , or inflame them ?
Wanted To Like It , But Couldn't ; Too Dated	I really wanted to like this film . It had personal sentiment for me as my mother's day was " Adeline " and I had high regard for Irene Dunne ever since I saw her star in " I Remember Maman . " Yet , despite that positive attitude going in , this wasn't something I'd watch again . It wasn't bad ; just too dated and I didn't care for Irene's soprano voice . Yikes , that women hit high notes that rattled my fillings ! At least she looked good : the most attractive I've seen her in her younger years . The film , though , as a whole , had a very dated appearance . Billed as a musical romance , I was impressed with how much humor was in this movie . As for leading men , I knew Donald Woods from " A Tale Of Two Cities " but he never struck me as forceful enough to be a leading man . Louis Calhern , however , always was credible at the detestable villain , as he was here once again . Reviewers here knock the script , but it was the songs that did nothing for me , not the screenplay . Had these songs been more appealing to me , I probably would have kept the VHS , if only for sentimental reasons .
The Good & Bad Of Judge Dredd	This was a loud , wild , silly , sophomoric science-fiction action film that had a number of good and bad points . THE GOOD - If you have a surround system , and particularly with a sub-woofer , the sound in here is excellent . For the most part , the film entertains and stays away from profanity until the last 15 minutes . Armand Assante plays a convincing villain . THE BAD - There is some stupid dialog , especially by Rob Schneider's character " Fergie . " He isn't funny ; he's just plain annoying . There's another cheap shot at Christians as the villain out in the desert is shown to be a " Believer . " None of the good guys are , of course . This also has a script that isn't easy to follow and it gets too loud with too many explosions . That stuff wears thin after the first hour . OVERALL - The negatives outweigh the positives . There are so many other good action movies that I wouldn't waste your time with this .
Humor Too Dated To Work Now	The story here was just a little too boring and the humor just not funny enough . It added up to a film that was too boring to watch . That was further surprising because the cast was good : Cary Grant , Lariaine Day , Charles Bickford and Henry Stephenson . Grant may be the only big " star " in that group but I've always found Bickford and Stephenson to play interesting guys and Day had to have about the prettiest eyes I've ever seen . They just sparkle and it makes her face mesmerizing at times . Unfortunately , that wasn't enough to make me impressed over this film . It's simply too dated , humor-wise . I don't know how it was received in 1943 , whether audiences laughed a lot at this but , unlike dramas , westerns , crime movies , etc . , comedies can look very dated very quickly and today's audiences would not laugh at this .
For Depp Fans Only	This was a generally " pleasant " film , or even " cute , " as some women might put it . . . . but not more much . It's definitely a " chick flick . " It was another early vehicle for Johnny Depp to play an oddball , something he's done ever since ( and done well ) . He's fun to watch here , too . A highlight is his impersonation of some Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin routines . Frankly , I didn't care for the rest of the lead characters , those played by Aiden Quinn ( too blasphemous ) and Mary Stuart Masterson ( nice at first , but then pouts all the time which gets tiresome ) . Quinn's girlfriend is also a brat . If you like Depp , then this is worth a look .
You'd Think A Polanski-Ford Combination Could Do Better	This is the kind of film in which one wonders if many people give it great reviews SIMPLY because Roman Polanski directed it . I've found this to be the case in many Alfred Hitchcock movies that were boring and overrated . The same things applies here , especially since Polanski seems to be trying to copy Hitchcock's ideas . The same holds true for actor Harrison Ford . He's usually in very good movies , but no one is perfect . It's hard to find a Harrison Ford movie that disappoints , at least during the last 20 years but , like any actor , he's had a few stinkers - like this is one . Actually , the story is interesting to a degree but the problem is that is goes on way too long without any sense being made . By then , the viewer is so frustrated it becomes difficult to get excited about the story . Chopping 20 minutes off this movie would have made it far better . It starts off so well but just plain peters out . Emmanuel Seigner , Polanski's wife , is interesting to watch and hear , but that's about it . The movie is simply too drawn out ; it needs a tighter script . Normally I like stories with " paranoid " themes , as this does , but Polanski only imitates Hitchcock here in the sense that he bored people to death with this effort . Don't buy all the rave reviews for this and don't say you weren't warned by me and a few others here .
Okay , But Just Too Hard , Too Nasty For Most People	This is not the 1947 film but a 1995 re-make of the famous gangster flick of the same name . While the classic film had one brutally nasty guy , this one has a whole cast full of them . . . . too nasty , frankly . I watched this once and was fairly interested in it . A couple of years later , took a second look and found it so sleazy and I couldn't finish it . David Caruso , who obtained a lot more fame in television shows than movies , still was interesting for me to watch as he played Victor Mature's old role . Caruso is one of the better actors I've seen when it comes to expressing his emotions just by his facial looks . It seems fashionable to knock him , but I've always been a fan of his work . Nicholas Cage plays Richard Widmark's psycho character " Tommy Udo " but is called " Little Junior Brown " in this film . Personally , I liked Widmark's performance and character much more . A lot of people , especially 20-somethings , like these modern tough films with brutal characters and tons of profanity , but the characters in this movie were so nasty that the film never really caught on with anybody . It certainly had one thing going for it : a very good cast that also included Samuel L . Jackson , Michael Rapaport , Ving Rhames , Stanley Tuccki , Helen Hunt and Kathryn Erbe . To summarize : it's not that bad : it just has too hard an edge to it .
Possibly The Only Weak Entry In the Rathbone-Holmes Series	Nothing that special in this Holmes story , except a few nice comments at the very end by our detective hero about America and Washington , D . C . Otherwise , it's just a so-so espionage story about a clip of microfilm that is hidden in some matchbook , with nobody but Holmes aware of that . The man who put it there was killed . The good guys want to make sure the bad guys don't get a hold of it . We follow the matchbook as it goes from one person to the next . Most of the suspects are those who were on the train carrying the man who had the microfilm in the first place . The problem with the film is there isn't enough suspense and the ending scenes are so hokey it's almost embarrassing to watch . And - by the way - what was with that hairdo on Basil Rathbone ( Holmes ) . That was really strange-looking , so much so it was distracting . Thankfully , he found a new barber for his other films .
Beautiful Colors But The Story A Bit Too Slow Story	This film is as slow as it is pretty , or you can reverse that . Either way : it's gorgeous with brilliant colors that are eye-popping . It's also one of the more boring stories I've ever seen and I defy most people to sit down and watch this all the way through and not be bored out of their minds despite the wonderful visuals . This turned out to be a soap opera , with a little bit of swordplay here and there . . . . . mostly there , meaning the second half of the film . By then , most people - - at least us Westerners - were sound asleep or had taken the DVD out of their player . Gee , they are even starting to show us dysfunctional families in Chinese films . I like Chow Yun Fat and Gong Li . Most people who like Asian films , which include me , like them , too , but that didn't make this film any more interesting . One other thing : whoever was responsible for the English subtitles ought to be shot . I played this in Chinese with English subtitles and in dubbed English with the subtitles also on . The latter is what stunned me in that I have never seen so many sentences different from what was being said on screen . Sometimes it was educational . I got two translations of the same sentence , but it got ridiculous and added to already confusing storyline . This is wonderful stuff on the surface : real eye candy , but the story sucks . I am starting to lose my faith in film director Yimou Zhang .
Aww , Aren't They Cute ?	This wasn't much of a story and Martin Sheen did probably the worst job of acting I've ever seen him do , but it doesn't really matter because the essence of the movie is the wildlife photography . John Varty , a British conservationist living in Africa , plays himself in this story of him raising two baby leopards and finding a home for them . Brooke Shields is an American writer looking to write about a story about it . She's just in the movie to show her pretty face and say , " Aww , aren't they cute ? " That's about all she does , which gets a little annoying after awhile . Some of the photography is spectacular , with beautiful scenery and a disturbing scene or two ( i . e . a crocodile trying to eat a water buffalo . ) The language is very mild , with only three swear words , probably put in to get a " PG " rating .
Colorful , But Not Too Humorous	Bugs , hiding inside a crate of carrots , winds up on the streets of Paris when the crate falls off the truck . He then meanders down the street and is spotted by competing chefs . They both think the rabbit is what they need to complete their menus . The colors in here are magnificent as they make Paris look really colorful . Our bunny hero , as he usually does , makes fools of his opponents in a variety of ways that makes them look really stupid . In this case , one of the chefs is a little too stupid for humor . Although there were a handful of funny lines at the expense of the French stereotypes at the time , this really wasn't one of the better Bugs Bunny efforts .
Okay . . . . But It Seemed A Lot Better When I Was A Kid	When I started collecting videos in earnest ( by the thousands ) , I was excited to get this film . I had such fond remembrances of seeing it on the big screen when I was young teen . I remember being terrified when Cary Grant was being chased by the crop duster and then awed at the end with the climactic scene on Mount Rushmore . I saw it maybe a decade or so later on television and enjoyed it again . Well , seeing the film again five years ago on DVD as a 50-something-year-old turned out to be a major disappointment , mainly because the first hour was so boring . The beginning had scenes that looked too dated and worse , were drawn out too long , such as Grant's drunk scene and the romance between he and Eva Marie Saint . Once Grant goes on the run , the story improves noticeably and mixing in some comedy with the drama was a good move . From that point , it's still the fun film I had remembered but , overall , didn't have the suspense anymore and , to this day , I believe is an overrated Alfred Hitchcock film . The more I see of Hitch's old films , the more disappointed I am , with the exception of Psycho and Rear Window .
Quite Memorable , But Gut-Wrenching At Times	Memorable . . . . . but bad memories outweigh good , at least for me , with this movie . That's my recollection of this film which , frankly , I haven't seen in over a decade . However , this movie left some indelible impressions in my sensitive memory , and perhaps I'll re-visit it again one day . Tom Hanks was mesmerizing as the haunted comedian , a man with a lot of talent to make people laugh but a guy tormented by the lack of support from his father . There is a scene or two in here with this dad that is so uncomfortable to watch that it has prevented me from seeing this another time . Too bad , because I do remember some wonderful , funny scenes such as Hanks in the hospital entertaining the patients . Sally Field also gives a touching performance as a housewife trying to break into the business , and John Goodman is likable as her husband . An interesting film with very emotional scenes you won't forget . It's almost too much for me , for some reason .
The Jokes Are On ' Jump '	Poor Charley Chase ; he can't win in this movie . He plays a reporter , " Jimmy Jump , " who goes to work on April 1 and is the butt of a number of April Fools jokes . The little kid who cleans the newsroom is the first to play several stunts on Jimmy . Then a few other reporters and secretaries also make him the butt of their jokes . " Jump " gets in trouble on two fronts : when he thinks something is a gag and it isn't , and when he tries pulling stuff on the boss that doesn't work . Actually , almost everything backfires on our hero . The way Jimmy is treat makes this story almost appear kind of sadistic , but it is entertaining and Jimmy gets a few licks in here and there .
Lightweight Bond Spoof	This James Bond spoof , headed by British comedian Rowan Atkinson , was okay . . . . a fair amount of laughs but not enough to add this film to my collection . Atkinson reminded me a bit of Benny Hill , a more famous English comedian who also doesn't speak much but lets his actions and facial expressions garner his laughs . Both are likable guys . John Malkovich plays a Frechman here and his accent is pretty good . He seems to be always playing strange roles . There really isn't a whole lot to say about this film . Except for a very funny toilet scenes , much of it isn't that memorable . Just a lightweight hour-and-a-half of entertainment .
Seagal Unfairly Criticized As Actor	This was Steven Seagal's first movie and pretty much summed up the way his films were going to go : marital arts-crime stories with overly despicable villains and our hero saving the women by out-fighting everyone . Jean Van Damme and others followed with the same recipe which , by and large , has been pretty successful . Before I saw this , I had read national critics blasting Seagal's acting talents but that was unfair ; he's not a bad actor . It was also a surprise to see Sharon Stone playing a nice role and without makeup ! That certainly changed quickly with her Basic Instinct-type persona . It was fun to see Henry Silva again . As a kid growing up in the ' 50s and ' 60s , I used to see Silva on television a lot . He always played a bad guy , and played the part well . . . . as he still does . Overall , a decent action flick but not one of Segal's more memorable films . He make a big upgrade with his next film , " Hard To Kill . "
A Singing Popeye Cartoon	This is an unusual Popeye cartoon in that 98 percent of the dialog is sung - and all of it one song : " The Daring Young Man On The Flying Trepeze . " It gets to be a little much after awhile and I'm glad this sort of thing wasn't the normal fare . In fact , I don't if it ever was done again in a Popeye animated short . You can't use any verbal jokes or add to the story when all you are doing is repeating verses of the same song over and over . However , the sight gags are very good in the beginning before the " trapeze song " took over , as Popeye sails an ocean liner through the dock and down the main street of a big city , right to Olive's house . We also see something else unique ( at least , I've never seen her ) : what looks to be Olive Oyl's mom . It's a shorter , fatter and older version of Olive . She sings to Popeye that Olive has run off with the " man in the flying . . . . " Fortunately , the circus is right across the street so Popeye takes a bunch of nearby street kids to the tent , watches the big musclebound guy on the trapeze swing a terrified Oliver around like a wet towel , and then goes to get his girl . The ending is funny and unexpected . Olive really took her lumps in this episode !
A Very Short , Early ' Oz '	This is a shock , at first , to view . It looks so primitive that you can hardly believe what you're seeing . It makes the 1939 version look like today's advanced technology , in comparison . The sky , for instance , looks like a cheaply painted paper mache that just moves right to left . That is supposed to indicate a windy day and looks so hokey you watch this in amazement . But , it's 1910 , and the very early years of motion pictures , so I am not ridiculing it . In fact , it makes you marvel how much they advanced in just several decades of film-making after this was made . It is interesting to note some of the differences in the story , too , such as Nebraska being mentioned instead of Kansas , but this was adapted from a stage play , not the novel ( as the ' 39 film was ) . Differences aside , it was still fascinating to watch because it's almost like going to school and watching your kids in some Middle School production ! Once again , I am not slamming it because I realize when it was made and appreciate the effort . . . . and historical value of this film . Also , it's hard to get much of a story in when the film's running time is only 13 minutes . Note : a young Bebe Daniels plays " Dorothy . " You can see this movie on DVD as part of the " More Treasures From the American Film Archives , which was released in 2004 .
2 Out Of 3 Ain't Bad	A bit of a soap opera , this film was divided into three segments as people recalled their experiences with " Jonathan Shields , " played well by Kirk Douglas . " Shields " was a guy interested in making movies and he used people to get to the top . Three of these people tell of their dealings with him , and none of them have too many good things to say . I liked the first and third segments but didn't care for the middle one with Lana Turner simply because Turner became so melodramatic , too hysterical for me . Barry Sullivan was excellent in the first part and helped get me into the story . He was the director who got " screwed " by Douglas . Turner was the unknown actress whom Douglas turned into a star while the last part dealt with the key screenwriter for Douglas , played by Dick Powell . I thought Powell was the best of the four main characters of the film but his segment was the shortest , unfortunately . As good as he was , his wife was equally as annoying . She was played by the normally entertaining and alluring Gloria Grahame , who was anything but that in this role . She sounded ludicrous with her fake southern accent . How she won an Academy Award for this role is mind - boggling . Some classify this movie as film noir , but I dispute that . It's simply a straight drama with soapish overtones . It's well-written , however , and keeps one's interest all the way , so I am not knocking this movie . It has a good things going for it .
A Strange Romance In ' Pussyville '	This story takes place in " Pussyville . " I am not making that up , nor am I touching that line . Similar to Felix The Cat in looks , we have " Master Tom " as the main figure in this story , which has literally no sound nor sound-effects , just title cards , courtesy of " Paramount Magazine " and a few comic-strip balloonsBasically , the story is Master Tom wooing a female . Their " trysting place , " as the card puts it , is a garbage can . We also see what happens when " the cat's away , " as five mice trash the house . They're funny to watch . Without saying more , the ending of this cartoon is really unexpected . It literally made my jaw drop . Overall , this is extremely primitive and dated but so bizarre that you can't take your eyes off it . It was part of the Popeye The Sailor 1933-1938 DVD set . Look for it under the bonus feature , " From The Vault . "
Different Story & Artwork	This is really different , an animated that you would think has to be really funny with the people that made it , guys like Chuck Jones and Frank Tashin , Paul Frees and Maurice Noble . . . . but it isn't . It simply is a comment on being who you are , and perhaps a dig or two on our industrialized , impersonal society . Whatever the intent , there is one thing for sure : this is different . One could made the same analogy with an alligator and the state of Florida . One day it's a swamp ; the next thing you know it's nothing but concrete and condominiums . Huh ? That's the scene here as the bear hibernates , wakes up and now he's in the middle of a big city and then , inside a factory where nobody believes he's a bear . Why would they ? Why would a bear be in a factor ? What happened to the open land where he lived ? Everyone has questions in here . However one interprets this story , I enjoyed the artwork and the modern style of it in this cartoon . Like the story , the artwork is very different from the Looney Tunes we are used to seeing from the 1930s through the 1950s . In some respects , it is very ' 60-ish looking , a la The Pink Panther cartoons . Whatever it is , if you own the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume Three , don't overlook this extra cartoon that is listed under " From The Vault . "
Reversing The Attitude On Cats	Felix wanders near a fish market , but the owner comes out and beats him up ( this is brutal ) and kicks him across the street to another eating establishment . There , Felix walks in and observes a guy pigging out on his spaghetti . Felix pleads for some food , like a dog , but the man only throws him a gob of hot mustard . ( Man , there are mean people in this cartoon . ) Poor Felix's mouth is on fire and he races out of the diner , hopping up and down in pain . He runs away , finds a pond and drinks it dry ! He continues his walk and overhears a bunch of anti-cat speech coming from City Hall . He peeks in the window , sees the mayor making a proclamation " Therefore be it resolved that we starve these feline pests out of our town . " Wow , I told you the people here are nasty ! Felix shakes his fist and says , " I'll get the gang and we'll see about this . " The rest is Felix and his thousands of feline allies vowing to make life miserable for those people and to restore cats to their rightful status , which they do in a humorous way . This is a pretty solid Felix cartoon , enjoyable all the way .
A Frightening Start	Well , this was the beginning of " Freddy Kreuger , " who certainly became famous in the horror movie genre . Of those horror films that spawned numerous sequels ( this one , Halloween , etc . ) this was the best of the " opening " shows . It definitely is frightening . It has the usual crude teenagers , some gratuitous sex and wild Krueger scenes and is probably best-noted for showing Johnny Depp's film debut . Boy , does he look young ! He looks about 16 years old , as does Heather Langenkamp , who went on to play in several more of these Nightmare stories . This was the only movie in which she was foul-mouthed . Nice to see Rony Blackley , too . Wes Craven certainly started this series off with a bang .
The Green River Killer	Most murder cases , it is said here in the beginning of this program , have about 200 pieces of evidence . The " Green River Killer " has over 10 , 000 . It is the longest-running and most prolific case of a serial killer in the history of the United States . The program , however , didn't out to be as dramatic or interesting as that opening statement was , although it wasn't boring , either . It just detailed the first few murders of this man who raped , strangled and then killed women in the Seattle area beginning in 1982 . Imagine that poor guy who saw the first victims . He thought they mannequins placed at the edge of a bank on the Green River . He went over to get a closer look . Soon there were five dead bodies with the same MO . That included all of them being prostitutes . The police went to the area where these women hung out but couldn't get anyone to talk . They either didn't trust police enough or were too drugged out to remember seeing anyone suspicious . The following month , The Green River started dumping bodies in waste grounds , instead . His eight victim was not a prostitute . He was trying to throw off the police . By the end of 1983 , the body count was up to 15 and the next year , the task force to catch him had been increased to 40 detectives . Still , there was no evidence linking police to any one guy and , despite everyone in the Seattle area looking for him , the death toll kept climbing . By 1987 , police finally had a prime suspect , a guy named Melvyn Foster , but he turned out to be innocent , making the police really look stupid , and also making them more cautious by not wanting to make that kind of mistake again . All of this worked toward the killer's advantage . . . . . although , finally , thanks to advances in DNA detection by the mid 1990s , the cops looked like they might have their man . Each serial killer leaves his " signature , " something he or she does that no one else does . In this case , the killer left a small stone in each dead woman's vagina . Thanks to that DNA work , and semen samples and minute speckles of spray paint on the victims , police finally arrested Gary Ridgway for the murder of four people . ( I'm condensing the story , reporting the highlights of this TV program . ) It is a shock to many people when they see what this prolific killer looks like , who later admitted he killed many more , even showing people were some of the graves were located . Of course , that was to aid his plea bargain to escape the death penalty . It is estimated , however , he might have killed up to 70 people . This case went on for slightly over two decades until this guy was sent to jail for life . After watching this , I just shook my head in amazement wondering how this Ridgway could kill so many people without police catching him . He has more " confirmed " murders than anyone on record in the USA . Some people in Washington State don't understand why a mass murderer like this hasn't been executed , in a state that allows it . Ridgway resides in Washington State Penitentiary in Walla Walla .
Fighting For The Right To Relax	Tom and Jerry " ham " it up in this one , fighting for the right to take a snooze in the nice hammock outside . Tom is all set for a catnap when he hears Jerry already on the hammock snoring away . He gets rid of the mouse , but that's the start of trouble . You know who gets the worst of this battle . Tom gets sliced and diced , let's just put it that way . I didn't find any laugh-out-loud sight gags but it kept my interest and I did enjoy each character dealing with a parade of ants . That probably was the the most innovative joke in here . You wonder : does Tom ever win any of these " battles ? "
Mixed Emotions Message-Wise , But Extremely Entertaining	This may be the only film that is blatantly anti-Christian that I still give a high rating , simply because it was so entertaining . Hopefully , some of the religious digs were tongue-in-cheek and not meant in a mean-spirited way , but I'm not sure , especially considering who made it . I DO know this was fun to watch and hear , except for the excessive usage of the Lord's name in vain with George Clooney as the main culprit . The music in here is super , led by the catchy " Man Of Constant Sorrow , " performed by Gary Tyminski . I also loved " Soggy Mountain Boys " humorously sang and presented by the three main characters : Clooney , John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson . Those three guys were hilarious , particularly Nelson with his rubber-faced looks . Audibly , the entire soundtrack is outstanding , under the direction of T-Bone Burnett . I wound up buying the CD as millions of other people did . Fantastic music . The way this was filmed makes it visually fascinating , with scenery enhanced by computer graphics and all-time great Roger Deakins in charge of the photography . All the people in this movie are wacky , as are the people who made it : the unfortunately clever-but-biased Coen brothers . The parade of wild characters , wild scenes one after the other and the three likable leads ( yeah , even the profane Clooney ) make this an extremely fast-moving 103-minute movie .
Last-Minute Fortunes Change For Lincoln , Union	In this episode , we learn ( at least I did , not being familiar with the man ) about Bedford Forest , " the most feared calvary commander of the war " and the man who raised himself in rank more than anyone in the Civil War . . Not being much of an expert on the civil war , any factors or opinions of this man were new to me and pretty fascinating . All the historians seem almost in awe of him . It was said he was almost impossible to defeat , no matter what the odds . The summer of ' 64 was the low point for the Union Army Grant's losses had been " appalling . " The army's progress was stalling and his grand strategy had apparently come to nothing . Nobody else was succeeding . even Sherman was stalled outside of Atlanta . No nation had ever held an election in the middle of a civil war - nobody in history . Horace Greely said there should be another ticket because Lincoln has no chance to win . Politicians in his own party preferred someone else . " We can't have a free government without an election , " said Lincoln , who felt he would lose , too , but the country's well-being was more important to him than his own personal gain . By the end of the summer , though , things looked better - a lot better - for both Lincoln and the Union . Sherman had taken Atlanta and some areas of the South had been totally devastated by the ruthless Philip Sheridan . At this point , though , it was tough to feel sorry for South after people learned about Andersonville , a prison camp of 33 , 000 inmates who were starved . It looked the Holocaust . Shown are some pictures of men , still living , who are literally skin and bones and as bad off as anything I've ever seen . Lincoln then gets elected easily . Robert E . Lee's former house is turned into Arlington National Cemetery . Overall , a very grim segment in this long , grim war . This is still an interesting series but this particular episode was tough to watch in spots . It got depressing .
Very Silly , But Fun & Fast-Moving	If you enjoyed Jim Carrey's " The Mask , " you might enjoy this Jackie Chan film . It has a similar storyline but instead of a mask , it's a suit someone puts on and receives some supernatural powers . It's all extremely silly but with a lot of slapstick and outrageous scenes , you are going to get some great laugh-out-loud scenes and some really stupid not-funny stuff . . . . especially in a Chan movie . Jackie is an amazing man , with the stunts he can do at his age . Meanwhile , Jennifer Love Hewitt is easy on the eyes , especially showing us her body , but her character in here is pretty lame . The whole movie is pretty brainless but if you don't care and just want some laughs and be entertained , this serves its purpose . It's certainly a fast-moving 99 minutes and there's nothing wrong with that .
Good War Flick , But A Little Too Much To Take	If you like war action films , this one is for you ! After a slow start - about 40 minutes to set things up - it's almost non-stop action the rest of the way as American soldiers fight in the streets of Somalia . Frankly , it was too much action for me , but I'm not a kid anymore so non-stop action gets a bit tiring after 20 minutes . This thing goes almost non-stop for 100 straight minutes . After awhile you want to just say , " Enough already ! Let's take a break ! I don't know how much of this story is true . When they say , " based on a true story " that could mean as much as 90 percent of it is fictionalized for dramatic purposes . However , reports are that it is pretty accurate . Regardless , the film has some good things going for it . First of all there is the military credo : : " Never leave anyone behind . " That message certainly is demonstrated here even at the cost of about 20 American lives and who knows who many Somalis as soldiers go back into action to rescue men after a helicopter ( named Black Hawk ) goes " down . " With today's filmmakers and special effects capabilities , you get Saving Private Ryan-type realistic action scenes . That also means you get some gruesome scenes , too . This film is very bloody . It's intense and visually unique , I think , for a war film . Speaking of that , with director Ridley Scott , you get stylish visuals : lots of them . In this film , you see bunch of interesting orange-ish colors , great lighting and great facial closeups . The sound also is excellent with bullets " flying out " of all the surround speakers . In the end , a little too much but still a good military movie that does justice to the unselfishness and heroism of the men in the military .
Amateurs Present Good , Simple Story	There isn't much to this story , I but I still liked it . The lead character , played by Wei Minzhi , is supposed to be playing a 13-year-old girl and was really interesting to watch , as were the young students and some of the other people in this film . Oddly , all these actors were amateurs , real-life students and people of varied professions . It's nicely filmed , too , despite the bleak background many times . I find the dialog of many Chinese films to be very pleasing . Yes , there is a lot of receptiveness , at least in the translations , but it's tolerable . There is very little profanity and plenty of good old-fashioned values and feelings of people , simply told . You don't find much of this is in modern-day movies of the Western World . The colors in here - the reds , yellows and oranges - are always a treat for the eyes and the Asian kids ' faces are intriguing . This film is very different from anything Western audiences are used to , but I recommend it for those who realize that fact and are okay with it .
Root Shines In Normal Jane Austen-Fare	Being a Jane Austen novel ( this edition brought to the screen courtesy the BBC ) , you know it's primarily a chick flick , a romance novel with old English spoken , very nicely photographed with nice period sets and scenery and some interesting women to view . This seems to be the case in most of the films , a la the famous combination of Merchant-Ivory . While this isn't that duo , it's still a decent version of this famous story . What's different about this is the leading actress : Amanda Root , who plays " Anne Elliot . " In America , this is not a lady whom we are familiar with , so she was a new " face " for me , as well . I liked her . I've heard criticism of her looks . You don't have to be glamorous to be accepted as a fine female actor . She was excellent in her role and just the looks on her face , particularly the sad looks , spoke more " volumes " than any dialog could manage .
Movie Went From Bad To Good	This wasn't bad , when you compare it to the average World War II film made back in the 1940s . In the first half , it had too many of the same negative aspects that many of its contemporary war movies had at the time . The narration was corny and the dialog by the GIs here is so dated and so racist it's embarrassing . Hey , I am the first to acknowledge how political correctness has run amok in recent years and , in fact , is out of control , but , still , hearing " Jap " yelled out every third sentence , and guys making slant-eyed " jokes " all the time is offensive , even for me . In that 40 minutes , we had the normal William Bendix-role of playing - - a-clown-from - Brooklyn , the priest who is a good guy but too often indistinguishable from the soldiers , the young kid who looks and acts about 15 , and most of the other cliché characters you see in this old movies . However , part of this was for a purpose : to show how these guys went from cocky , almost - ignorant soldiers who underestimated their foes , to veterans who calmed down and had their arrogant attitude kicked out of them . In fact , Bendix wound up making some very profound statements about 20 minutes from the end when things really looked bad . There's a lot of honesty in this movie , as it turned out . But , despite that first 40 minutes of mostly-inane chatter which took away from the sense of the guys being in a brutal situation , which these GIs were in - the second half made up for it . It had tons of drama , suspense and action , plus a plea or two to the folks back home in the USA watching this film . I have no problem with that . Why not ? Our soldiers should always be given whatever they need since they're putting their lives on the line for us back here . Some people didn't like those , nor the prayers or the religious angle in here , but that's today's secular-progressives who have no tolerance . I read one big-city critic who objected to the scene showing the soldier disappointed he didn't get any mail ! Give me a break . Sorry , but sometimes it's good to see a war movie with some old fashioned patriotism , " religion " and sentimentality . Overall , however , these 60-some-year-old movies just can't stack up to the realistic ones made today , and that's understandable . But , credit this film with having easily more actual war action than the average movie of its day and totally switched from dumb to pretty intelligent the last half of the movie . These guys got pummeled from the land , the sea and the air . It would be interesting to see this movie re-made today . It might be tough to watch with all the carnage , but I'd like to see it with a appropriate tribute to these brave men . The DVD sports a good transfer . " Fox War Classics " always look pretty sharp .
Entertaining , But Did Daffy Steal Wile E . Coyote's Act ?	Just seeing Daffy dressed up in Robin Hood's green-and-red outfit and playing the mandolin while singing is pretty funny in itself Porky Pig plays Friar Tuck . Well , he has the build . This Robin Hood is so unimpressive that the Friar is convinced it is " he . " Daffy , er Robin , finally says , " Look - I'll prove I'm Robin Hood . See this guy passing by ? I'll rob him of his gold and give it to some poor unworthy slob . " Ahh , finally a Robin Hood who tells it like it is ! From that point , this cartoon was a ripoff of the Road Runner . Daffy trying to rob the guy was exactly like Wile E . Coyote attempting to get the Road Runner . Every thing that happened to him , I've seen in RR cartoons . Did Daffy steal his act here from Wile ? Since this came out in 1958 , apparently so . The only thing original was the ending when Daffy says " Shake hands with Friar Duck . " That was a great closing line . The best thing about this animated short was the color . This is another case in which the restoration job is fully appreciated because the forest colors are magnificent . It can be seen on the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume Three .
What Happened To Vance & Sciorra ?	Since I watch this show in chronological order , I was shocked to see two more regulars missing , especially " Ron Carver , " the district attorney . Did I miss something ? I remember " Capt . Deakins " ( Jamey Sheridan ) commenting about leaving at the end of the fifth season , but there was nothing on Carver ( Courtney Vance Jr . . ) exiting the show . The other person who has disappeared is " Det . Barek , " played by Annabella Sciorra . Now , I know her character was bland ( not Sciorra's fault if they gave her a dull roll ) but , as in Vance's case - don't they owe us viewers an explanation ? This is ridiculous . She's just gone and we are introduced to " Det . Logan's ( Chris Noth ) new partner , " Megan Wheeler " ( Julianne Nicholson ) . Nicholson looks like a good edition . The writers have given her a lot better dialog than they gave Sciorra , and she's young and pretty , so most male viewers will like the change . Still , it would have been courteous to mention what happened to these other characters , especially Carver since he was with the show since its inception . Replacing Vance is Theresa Randall as " A . D . A . Patricia Kent . " Here role was so small in here I can't make a judgment about her . All I know is I really enjoyed Vance in this show and I'm not happy about him leaving . The same goes for Sheridan , who is more likable than Bogosian . As for this episode's story , it is right out of the front pages of the newspapers the last few years : a female teacher having sex and a relationship with a younger student . I believe Mary Kay LaTourneau might have been the " inspiration " here but there have been more - several in Florida - that have followed in her footsteps . This is a sordid story about two extremely people and sleazebag plastic surgeon , who is the father of the young boy involved with his teacher . Yeah , it's a pretty sleazy story . The episode is titled " Tru Love , " and , boy , it's a strange kind of love , that's for sure !
George , The Faithful Servant	In this story , Negro servant " George " is asked to look after his master's wife and child when he ( " Colonel Frazier " ) goes off to war . Soon , the master is killed in the Civil War . It's bad enough the man died , but then the heartless Yankees came and looted the house and burned it down . George goes into the fire and retrieves the small child and the Frazier's sword - a sentimental piece offered to his wife after her husband's death . George , the woman and child - all homeless - then find a shack and poor George has to sleep outside . End of story . Wilfred Lucas played " George ; " Dell Henderson , " Col . Frazier " and Claire McDonald played Frazier's wife . She had a very square face that reminded me a bit of Demi Moore . For a film made in 1911 , I thought the battle scenes were pretty good and were probably considered " big production " at that time . I know the obvious flaw of having all white actors play the black people will turn off a lot of viewers but that's the way it was for the first three decades or so in film-making , and you just accept it as a " product of its time . " Otherwise , this was a decent little drama for when it was made and that ending , with George curling up on the front steps to sleep , was very powerful , I thought .
Austin's Anatomy	While the first two Austin Powers films in this comedic series concentrated on spoofing the late ' 60s / early ' 70s , James Bond movies and concentrated on female anatomy in the process , this one was centered on penises . I did you not . ( Hence , the title , a play-on-words from " Goldfinger . " ) I watched this film twice , within two weeks of each as I showed a friend the second time . The first time I thought it wasn't as funny overall as the other two Powers films and was a bit too raunchy , especially for the PG-13 rating which is ridiculous . After the second viewing , I changed my mind about the comedy ( not the rating ) : it is just as funny if not more than the other two . A couple of the scenes were hilarious , although very crude in spots but some of the crudeness is what makes it funny . However , most of time I laughed more at the many subtle double entendres and all the double takes by Mike Myers , who plays at least four characters in here . . . all of them very well . It's goofy , stupid and nothing spectacular but definitely fast-moving and entertaining . If you've seen the other Austin Powers films , you know what this basically is going to be , humor-wise . Beyonce Knowles , who played the female lead , didn't have the beauty or body of Heather Graham or Elizabeth Hurley , stars of the other two films , but she isn't bad . There are numerous cameo appearances in here , starting right off the bat with Tom Cruise . Overall : sick ( again ) but funny ( again . )
Leopold-Loeb Re-Telling Has Interesting Characters	This was pretty interesting , thanks to Bradford Dillman who was excellent as one of the murderers , and to Orson Welles , as defense attorney " Jonathan Wilk . " Wells could be such an imposing presence on screen ! Interesting , too , that his character was an atheist but in the end admitted he may have been wrong about that . E . G . Marshall also was fun to watch as the prosecutor , " Dist . Att . Harold Horn , " but , of course , the screen writers had him silent in the end only showing Welles state his liberal impassioned anti-death penalty speech at the end . Dillman and Dean Stockwell were the wise-guys , young arrogant punks who thought they were smarter than anyone else . Dillman held up under pressure but Stockwell was an annoying wimpy wuss who cracked . Diani Varsi playing the lukewarm love interest , adds very little to the film . Overall , this re-telling of the famous Leopold-Loeb case of the 1920s was worth the watch and recommended . If this kind of story fascinates you , I recommend a similar film : " Rope " ( 1949 ) .
Great For Its Day	For a long , long time this was a memorable film and one of my favorites . It was one of the first VHS tapes I bought . After a long hiatus , I bought the DVD , watched it again and - wow , it wasn't so hot anymore . Oh , Warren Beatty , Faye Dunaway and Michael J . Pollard are still very good in their respective roles as Clyde , Bonnie and C . J . What annoyed me were the characters played by Gene Hackman and Estelle Parsons . Hackman has gone on to have a very distinguished career but he is just a stupid moron in here he's no fun to watch . However , it's a picnic watching him compared to listening to Parsons shrieking and screaming through her abrasive role . Those two ruin the film for me now . I'll still have fond memories and I'll always remember the time I first saw this in the theaters when it came out . The violent ending caused quite a stir at that time . Nobody had seen blood and bullets on screen like that before . Now , it's commonplace . . . . even tame compared to many of today's scenes ! This was another of those films that began in the ' 60s in which the bad guys were portrayed as the good guys and vice-versa . It's still highly-recommended for those who have never viewed it .
Not A Fan Of Soaps , But I Like This !	This was surprisingly good . I say " surprising " because I am not a man who likes soap operas and that's what I expected here from everything I had read about this film . The only reason I obtained it was that it was part of a 3-pack Bette Davis collection and I wanted a DVD of " The Letter . " Well , this turned out to be a very interesting and gratifying story . No , I still didn't like the corny - and adulterous ( which Hollywood loves to glamorize ) - love affair between Davis and married man Paul Henreid . However , I did enjoy the ugly duckling-turned-beauty story that featured Davis tolerating her nasty mother and then using her experiences to help another young lady who was suffering from a similar inferiority complex . Gladys Cooper was outstanding as the irritating , brutal mother . Janis Wilson was the young girl helped in the end by Davis . Wilson overacts something fierce but the message is so nice and the sentimentality so caring that you put up with the kid's performance . Claude Raines also was likable as the psychologist . He had a number of good lines in this film . The movie was nicely filmed and looks particularly good on the DVD transfer with attractive grays completing the black-and-white .
Early CGI , But Still Very Good	In the early ' 90s computer animation was beginning to take hold and one-hour films like this would feature this new technology . There is supposed to be a story here , but good luck finding it . The fun is in the visuals which range from good to outstanding . My favorite segment is the music one with the jazz players and Washington-Lincoln . Speaking of music , not all of it is the standard instrumentals . There are a couple of vocals . There also is some short narration . The whole thing is about 45 minutes with 10 minutes of ending credits tacked on . This may be over a decade old in a technology that has grown leaps and bounds , but it's still good stuff and worth checking out .
Only In Cartoons Can These Crazy Things Happen !	Felix is watching an actor rehearse his lines : " A ham , A ham ! My kingdom for a ham sandwich ! ! ! " The dramatic guy that tells Felix he'll " have to sacrifice my art and go into the movies . " He's in tears . Felix just looks at him like he's nuts , and shrugs his shoulders . The old guy tells Felix to " go ye forth " and find money to finance a trip to Hollywood . Felix thinks , " How does he expect me to get the money ? " In minutes , of course ( this is a cartoon ) , he spots a shoe business owner putting up a " bankrupt " sale on his store . Felix comes up with a plan to bail him out and the man promises the cat $500 if it works . Well , it does but the man wants to go alone and leave Felix at home . In an outrageous scene , Felix transforms himself into a briefcase and that's how he gets to Hollywood , transforming himself back to cat when they get there . We then witness Felix's attempts at getting into show business . His audition scenes are very funny , especially with his imitation of Charlie Chaplin . In addition there are caricatures of some famous silent film stars and executives . In all , quite a bit of material is in this 9 . 5 - minute cartoon . It's amazing how much more you can get in an extra 2 . 5 minutes , assuming most animated shorts are seven minutes in length . At any rate , there were a number of laughs in here and more zany things you could only see in a cartoon , like Felix have a sword duel with giant mosquitoes ! Crazy stuff .
Popeye The Serial Killer !	Popeye begins this with his familiar song but an unfamiliar role : rocking a baby to sleep in its carriage on a sidewalk outside . When nearby Harpo Marx's harp playing wakes up the baby , Popeye kills him with one sock , and poor Harpo is now playing his harp with a halo over his head . More crazy scenes occur , like Popeye singing and playing a banjo ; the baby taking his pipe , smoking it and blowing smoke rings . From that point , the whole story is Popeye doing whatever he can to stop noise , so the baby will go back to sleep and stay that way . Outrageous scenes follow . Popeye's solution to everything , at least in these first-year cartoons , is to sock it - whether it's people or an inanimate object . You cannot believe the damage - and the number of people he killed - our " sailor man " does in this story . In real life , he would spent his entire life in jail , if the jail could hold him !
A Film Recommended For All , Especially Kids With Cancer	If you know of any kids who are suffering with cancer , and especially those who diagnosed as terminally ill , this would be an inspiring film for them . Meanwhile , who doesn't like looking at butterflies ? Well , this story is a lot more than that , but you might as well enjoy the fantastic insects and nature scenery of Costa Rica while going along for this ride . This is another based-on-a-true story film , about boy dying of brain cancer getting his wish to go track down the mysterious " Blue Morpho " butterfly which supposedly brings magical powers . The film stars William Hurt and a couple of unknown actors : Marc Donato , who plays the boy , " Pete Carlton , " and Pascale Bussieres as his mom , " Teresa . " All three do a fine job . I really enjoyed the wildlife photography . Some of the insects , reptiles , birds and animals in that part of the world are just amazing . The story tries hard not to be sentimental , sometimes too hard and also infers near the end that the young boy was magically healed by some spirits of the jungle . Filmmakers love promoting mystical New Age-type stuff . Nonetheless , unlike what I expected , there was a happy ending to this story . Most importantly it was happy conclusion for the real person . Obviously , that is what is really important . This is the real-life story of David Marenger , who is a grateful , now-healthy young man who spends his time wisely helping other kids with illnesses . You can see him in an interview that accompanies the DVD .
The Good & The Bad Of ' Ace In The Hole '	This hard-to-see film finally came to TCM recently so I was anxious to check it out . ( To my knowledge it has never been issued on VHS or DVD ) . I found the fist hour to be riveting with crisp dialog , interesting characters , and some nice camera shots by director Billy Wilder and photographer Charles Lang . Kirk Douglas was intense as " Chuck Tatum " and Jan Sterling ( " Lorraine Minosa " ) was pure film-noir platinum blonde with attitude . Then , the next 40-45 minutes disappointed me , to be frank . Tatum slowly softens to the point where the film loses its edge , going from an adventure story-film noir to more of a melodrama . Sterling's character almost disappears from the screen , which doesn't help . However , with 10 minutes left in the film , a shocking scene with her jolted me back to full attention . Going back to Sterling for a minute , if you are a film noir fan and rank Marie Windsor high on your list of actresses , you'll love Jan in here . It just wish she had a bigger part . My other " wish " was that this script would have been a little tighter . I drags too much in the second half . About 10-15 minutes cut out of here would have made this easier to watch and keep the suspense tighter . The story is not an unusual one . I've seen it on film a number of times , the from the classic era to now : an overzealous newspaperman going past the bounds of good taste and ethics to get ( or " keep " in this case ) a good story going , just for the welfare of himself or his paper . Yet , this " yellow journalism " or " tabloid mentality " story has some different twists to it , such as being set in a mountainous desert , not in a big city . The acting is superb , not just with the two leads but with all the supporting actors , led by Porter Hall , who played the newspaper editor " Jacob Boot . " I also appreciated the sarcastic comedy in here as Wilder and the screenwriters parody the " carnival " atmosphere which develops when a tragedy occurs and people make a financial profit out of it . As the days linger on and the man in this story clings to his life trapped deep in a mine , the circus atmosphere grows . Hence , the second title of this film : " The Big Carnival . " That latter title was used when the film bombed at the box office in America the first time it was shown . Later , it was reissued under that second title . It still bombed . However , today it seems to be getting cult status , I would believe a DVD of this will be forthcoming because my guess is that it would sell .
DVD Did Not Do Justice To These Stunning Visuals	After I first saw this , I thought , " Wow , this is the most spectacular movie , visually-speaking , I've ever seen . " Since that time , I've seen some that topped it but it still ranks as one of the best in that department . I'm just disgusted the long-awaited DVD was so poorly done , the quality of this transfer hardly better than the VHS tape . The jungle scenes are filmed in Cameroon , and " lush " is the best adjective to describe what you see . Except for jungle sounds , " seeing " is certainly almost everything in the beginning as there is almost no " hearing , " no dialog until Tarzan ( Christopher Lambert ) befriends Ian Holm and vice-versa . . . . so be ready for that , if you haven't watched this film . Story-wise , all I'll say is this is not the Tarzan many of us came to know in Johnny Weismuller films . . . . . but that's not a complaint . For those craving action , and don't care about cinematography as I do , you just have to get past that silent introduction period In this Tarzan version , our hero goes back to Scotland ( his roots ) , adapts to that environment ( for the most part . . . . and a little too quickly for credibility , frankly ) and then returns to the jungle without Jane . This is supposedly more true to the Tarzan books , written by Edgar Rice Burroughs . The special effects in here were done by Rick Baker , one of the best in the business . Sharp DVD or not , this is still a stunning film to view and very interesting throughout its 2 hours and 15 minutes .
The Ultimate Smear Campaigners ?	Yosemite Sam is running for mayor . One of his campaign promises is " to rid this country of every last rabbit . " Bugs chokes on his carrot when he hears this . " Hey , this calls for strategy . I'll fight fire with fire , " he proclaims . He decides to run against " Honest Sam . " Talk about smear campaigns ! Mainly , what these two guys try to do is the blow the other guy up , with dynamite stuck in everything from watermelons to pianos . It's the usual fare , but that means some clever gags and Bugs usually outwitting the loud and obnoxious Sam . In the ending , well , let's just saw a " dark horse " surprises both candidates .
Lots Of Info To Start This Series Off	This first segment in this 9-part television series looks at the beginnings of the American Civil War : how the South felt and why it seceded from the Union ; President Abraham Lincoln's election , and the beginning battles of this famous war . This , being the longest episode of the series at 100 minutes , had a lot of facts presented . To those not well-versed on the war ( such as I ) , this was like taking a course in American history . There are so many facts to learn and names to remember - if I want to keep up with this series - it gets taxing on one's brain . However , the program is presented in such a format that it is usually interesting . Filmmaker Ken Burns went on to use this format in his other projects , such as the series on baseball . He shows a lot of black-and-white pictures of the era , throws in some modern day color shots ( which are beautiful ) and adds narration to everything . The latter is in the form of letters written by witnesses of the war , or in biographies or in comments by modern-day historians . The voices are provided by a host of people , from history writers and commentators to Hollywood actors . Those quoted most often in this opening show are two of the most eloquent men in U . S . history : Lincoln and Frederick Douglass , the black leader of his day . Also , at the end of this segment , we hear quite a bit about George McClellan , a man who got the Union armies in shape to fight . Overall , there were too many bits of information to recall them all here .
A Very Good , Unknown Film Noir	This was a bit of a sleeper , better than I thought and not a well-known film to begin with , since it never came out on VHS . William Holden and Nancy Olson both worked on Sunset Boulevard this same year this was released and here are together again . Actually , I like the two a lot better in this film than the much better - known ' Boulevard . ' Yes , some of the scenes are a bit dumb but the story moves well and keeps your interest which is what a good crime story-drama should do . For some reason , I really enjoyed the train station , too . It looked awesome . Hopefully , some day this movie will be part of a film-noir package on DVD .
Getting To Know The Family Better	This documentary was interesting to me because I saw it right after reading both of Frank McCourt's books : Angela's Ashes and Tis . So , I was interested to see what the documentary offered . What it offers is a brief summary of what happened to Frank and is three brothers after they had all arrived in the United States as young adults from Ireland . Frank's story I knew , but nonetheless he's always interesting to hear , not just read about . His brothers , which look similar to me with their pudginess and white hair , all have some interesting tales to tell . The Irish make good storytellers , that's for sure . Near the end of this 70-minute program is a very dramatic scene when the brothers get together to find the grave site of their sister who had died shortly after birth . All in all , if you are fan of the brothers ' work , this a nice documentary of a very interesting family . I would watch it more than once , just on its own merit .
A Shock For First-Time Viewers	Wile E . Coyote versus Bugs Bunny ? Wow , this was a new one on me , when I first saw it , but it occurred a couple of times in Loony Tunes cartoons . . . . and we , the viewer , are the winners for it . Also different for first-time viewers of this collaboration between two LT stars , is hearing Wile speak . . " Allow me to introduce myself , " he says right off the bat to Bugs . He gives Bugs his card which reads " Wile E Coyote - Genius . " He then proceeds to tell Bugs , in a muted British accent , no less , that he intends to eat him . He's gonna give Bugs " the customary two minutes to say your prayers . " Bugs slams the portable door on him , says no thanks , and disappears back into his rabbit hole while Wile goes back to his cave muttering " Why do they always want to do it the hard way ? " After that , it's standard " Roadrunner " material with Wile pulling out every plan he has under " Operation : Rabbit " in his arsenal . . . . and the predictable result . The " smart " guys goes through a half dozen plans while the " dumb " thwarts him every time . I loved the ending to this cartoon as Wile humbly calls himself something else . This was a lot of fun to watch and a good lesson for those elitists who think they are smarter than most others . Surprise ! ! !
Seal-ing The Deal	This is more of a " cute " story than a comedy , although it has both charm and laughs , along with some nice artwork . In essence , a baby seal escapes from the zoo . The animal is tired of blowing horns ; his job is boring . He tells this to Jerry Mouse after winding up in the swimming pool where Jerry and Tom live . After Tom , Jerry and the seal all hear that there is a $10 , 000 reward for the return of the seal , Tom goes after him . The normal chase scene is a bit different because Tom is chasing a seal , not Jerry , and Tom has to perform circus acts ( high wire and such ) to catch the seal . Funny sight gags included Jerry helping to produce a " dancing fish " and Tom doing his high - dive into a glass of water . The show features an odd ending : one , of course , that could never happen and one that you wonder , " Why would Tom be content doing this ? "
Wacky Characters Make For Fun Movie	It's funny how it was decades since viewing this movie again but I always remembered Dom DeLuise experimenting and lighting up a joint , and then laughing hysterically . That laugh put me in tears laughing so hard at him laughing and wheezing ! DeLuise , who I was sorry to see abuse the Lord's name in vain so much in this film , at least early on , is still fun to watch as are his partners in crime in this story : Suzanne Pleshette , Jerry Reed and Ossie Davis . Actually , DeLuise , Reed and Pleshette play undercover cops in a sting operation , if you can believe that ! If you enjoy seeing oddball characters , you'll like this movie . It certainly has it's share of wackos .
As Time Goes By	I found this to be an interesting film ; certainly not boring as I had heard from a few people who saw it in the theater . To me , it was simply good storytelling . Yes , it's slow , especially by today's movie standards , but it's certainly a unique story and it's nicely filmed , acted and directed . Story-wise , it's one of those films I understand if people love it or hate it . I'm somewhat in the middle and leaning toward the positive . For a movie that runs for over 2 hours and 40 minutes and is not some suspense or action film , it has to be pretty good to hold one's interest . I can only speak for myself ; it held my interest for 95 percent of it . I think the first two-thirds of the movie is the best . Brad Pitt as " Benjamin Button " is pretty fascinating , as is the story of him growing up from a wrinkled , old man-baby to a mid-40s guy . When he re-unites with childhood friend " Daisy " ( Cate Blanchett ) and becomes her lover , the film bogs down in a few spots but few people are going to stop watching after investing two hours . It picks up again , especially in the last minutes when " Benjamin " begins to finally become younger than an adult . There's a sadness to this story , especially near the end but overall , even though it's central theme seems to be " death , " I don't think it's a depressing film . It does remind us , in a big way , that the longer we're around , the more death of friends and loved ones we witness . That's just a sad fact of life . I hear about it all time with my father , who is 91 years old and has seen almost all of his friends die . It's especially true in this story when Benjamin starts off and has a lot of old friends to begin with ! " Benjamin " was an odd person to me ; you could root for him , yet not admire him . He often treated people only to satisfy his desires and could have been so much more . Yet , being " a fly on the wall " and observing his interesting life , was memorable , making this a film worthy of the time invested to watch it . In the end , the movie made me appreciate the friends I do have , and not to take any of them for granted as life passes us by so fast , no matter what direction we're headed !
Especially Hard To Take When A Victim Is Totally Innocent	Both of these cases take place in Miami , Fla , with two different lead detectives . One is a series regular : Det . Fernando Bosch while the other is Det . Emilano Tamayo . In Tamayo's case , police get a frantic 911 call stating , " The bullets are flying everywhere ! It turns out two men were in a shootout right in front of a small convenience story . The sad story is that a customer inside , Jessica Dixon , 23 , was struck with one of the bullets and died . Here is a totally innocent victim ; just someone out buying groceries . The police officers in this case are bothered a great deal by this , as they hate to see innocent people senselessly killed . Most people would agree with them . People knew that two people were shooting because a video camera caught one of them on tape . He had fled the scene , as well as the killer who had come by in his car . They quickly scour the hospitals and find their man . At first , he won't talk but when detectives show him a picture of the innocent victim , he breaks down . The man has a heart . After shedding some real tears , he gives them a first name : Corey . Police find out his full name through a marriage database at the station ( computer lists ) . " Wow , it's just one more reason why not to get married , " cracks one wise-guy cop after the database reveals their man . The postscript to this case was a shock : after all that work , the witness gets cold feet and refuses to cooperative and the killer , Corey D . Harris , is let free ! Bosch heads up a force that has to go to the " Little Haiti " section of Miami to find witnesses . A man had been gunned down , but his girlfriend had been face-to-face with the killer . His gun was out of bullets or she would have been murdered , too . The woman , Clara , knows him as a former classmate named " Steve . " The cops get a yearbook and she spots his picture . Steve Stirlin has been identified . However , he proves hard to find , especially with neighborhoods which won't cooperate . " It's a miracle that murders sometimes get solved around here , " cracks one cop . It took four months but they got him .
Starting To Become More Clever	They have some pretty decent sight gags in here , especially the beginning when Popeye and Olive are in their ocean raft sailing toward an island . How he makes the raft go , and provide sardines , is pretty goodOnce the two get to the island , it's " Wild Kingdom " as all kinds of animals appear and none of them friendly . Can Popeye fight off an elephant ( and numerous other beasts ) and at the same time rescue Olive from a King Kong-type ape ? That's the storyline . Overall , this was very good and you can see the gags are getting a little more clever as this cartoon evolves . One thing that was different in this one was Olive feeding Popeye his spinach at the end . This was the sixth theatrical release .
A Shockingly-Straight Story From David Lynch	" A truly nice story with a moral about brotherly love " describes this odd David Lynch film . This was especially " odd " because it wasn't the kind of film Lynch had been putting out in the last 15 - 20 years . Those were dark and shocking films ( Blue Velvet , Wild At Heart , Mulholland Drive ) and this is the opposite . I know it disappointed a lot of his fans . Others were delighted by it . Count me as one of the latter , and I own all three of those " dark " films , too . This was another supposed-true life story , here detailing an elderly man's trip in a seated lawnmower from western Iowa all the way to Wisconsin to see his ailing brother who he hasn't talked to in years but wants to see before the latter dies . Well , I guess that premise - an old man driving a lawn mower 400 miles - still makes this an " odd " film of sorts , so Lynch stays in character with that ! Richard Farnsworth plays the title role . He is the type of guy , face-wise , voice-wise , low-key personality-wise , that just about everyone likes . The wrinkles on his face tell many a story . It was so sad to hear what happened to him in real life a year after this film was released . The first 25 minutes of this film isn't much , and not always pleasant as it shows the main character's adult and mentally-challenged child ( Sissy Spacek ) and her tragic past , but once Alvin Straight ( Farnsworth ) begins his trip , the story picks up . I played this for several friends and they thought the film NEVER picked up , but I am more generous with it . I think it's a hidden gem . To them , it was a sleeping pill . I found his trip pretty fascinating but you have to realize in advance this is NOT going to be a suspenseful Lynch crime story . It IS slow and if that's okay with you , you might like this . Charm enters the picture in some of people Alvin meets along the way , such as a wayward young girl running away and some nice town folks who help the old man out when he gets in trouble . ( Henry Cada as " Daniel Riordan , is a standout in that regard . ) Harry Dean Stanton gets third billing , but that's a joke : he's only in the final few minutes of the movie ! The Iowa scenery is pleasant . I lived there for several years and can attest to the rolling hills and the rich soil . It's a nice state with nice people . . . . like this movie .
Harry Meets The Worst Woman Since Ann Savage	The fourth in the " Dirty Harry " series , this film features one of the most despicable , ugliest , unlikable , profane , disgusting females I have ever seen on film : " Ray Perkins , " played by Audrie Neenan . She is the modern nasty low-life version of the 1945 " Detour " character , " Ann Savage . " Her foul mouth and gutter attitude turned me off so much I never watched this film again until I acquired a profanity filter which shut her up . . . . and least some of her ! Then I could enjoy the rest of the movie . Everywhere " Harry Callahan " ( Clint Eastwood ) goes , violence immediately follows . . . . . within minutes ! It happens so often it's almost laughable but it makes for a fast-moving , entertaining film with a satisfying ending as all the scumbag villains are eliminated one-by-one . This is a very sophomoric film that appeals to our base instincts . . . . . and connects , sad to say . Most of us like to see these dirtballs get it in the end , and who does it better than Dirty Harry ?
' Well , The Least You Can Do Is Get Me Liquored Up '	With a title this corny , I was expecting a lot of laughs , a fun B-movie with Ed Wood-style film-making . Well , I got them , but that mostly in the beginning . The bulk of the film is quite serious and holds up pretty well , even today . The best lines , in the opening segments , come from " Marge " ( Gloria Talbott ) , the one I quoted for the subject head . She said that on her wedding night at the restaurant , since her new husband seemed to be ignoring her . You see , her hubby had already been taken over by an extra-terrestrial being the night before . He just wasn't himself after that . . . . . but who knew ? Unfortunately , nobody for quite awhile in this story , which made life rough for poor " Marge Ferrell . " The lines in this film weren't just corny . Some of them were downright funny . At the guy's bachelor party , which began the show , the men had some humorous lines about marriage and freedom , and later in the show there are a couple of funny scenes . Later one of Marge friends acts goofy and remarks , " I just love to rehearse for weddings , especially when they are my own ! " However , the story begins to get serious after the first 10-15 minutes and gets more and more so after Marge follows her husband one night and sees her odd-acting husband is not the man she thought she married . Laser beams and a spaceship will do that to you ! From that point , it becomes a very familiar story for fans of sci-fi : something we've seen in a lot of films the past 50 years - aliens transform into humans and one that hasn't gets burned by family and friends she trusts because she doesn't realize they , too , have also turned into aliens . In other words , this has a lot of " Invasion Of The Body Snatchers " type of paranoia story , just without the pods . " Invasion " was released two years earlier than this in 1956 . Hollywood , lacking imaginative writers the past few decades , continues to make films with the same storyline as you see here . , but this one can be excused because it was still fairly early in the genre . Thanks to the actors here , and a few different twists , the movie keeps your attention . The only frustration is to see a person telling the truth and not being believed . Talbott , to me , was a familiar face because she acted in many television shows in the 1960s while Tyron , who got some hype for starring in " The Cardinal , " a big-name film that bombed at the box office , wound up being a better writer than an actor . But when it comes to ' 50s sci-fi films , great acting isn't a requirement anyway , and most of us don't watch it for that . Overall , this is pretty good , nothing super but certainly worth a look now that there is a good DVD transfer of it available . Yes , it is far better than the stupid title but still : don't take it too seriously - just have fun with it . Note : the police captain was played by John Eldredge , a regular guest on " The Adventures Of Superman , " in which he almost always played a villain . Also ex-boxer Maxie Rosenbloom is his normal entertaining self in here , playing , as usual , a bartender .
Being A Gangster - It's Not All Glamor !	I found this to be an interesting character study of a Cuban who comes to Miami and becomes a big drug dealer , rising from little to become a big-shot and wealthy . . . . and then destroy himself . The movie got panned at the time of its release for its excesses in profanity and violence . . . . but now since we've all become desensitized with decades of this stuff , the film is now almost reaching " cult status . " Amazing . The critics , meanwhile , loved " Casino , " which - profanity - wise , made " Scarface " sound like " Mary Poppins . " Go figure . Nonetheless , at the time , Al Pacino ( " Tony Montana " ) probably set a new Hollywood record for using the f-word in a mainline film , now topped by anyone who performs in a Martin Scorcese film . Pacino's wife , " Elvira " played by the beautiful Michelle Peiffer , wasn't a lot more wholesome than her husband . She got really brutal as the film wore on . If that language is no problem , you'll find the story quite interesting and a good study of how paranoia must wind up haunting most gangsters . It's a real down side to living the live of crime . Near the end , Pacino is going to bed each night with a gun his pillow . That's not how you want to get a good night's sleep . Anyone who thinks being a big-time crook is " the life , " should watch this film and pay attention . It may look like " crime pays , " but it doesn't , no matter how wealthy those gangsters are . I mention all this because this movie is perfect portrayal of how the paranoia of being in the drug business can do you in , as well as other problems that can do you in . It isn't all glamor . Even Pfeiffer's great face can mask the ugliness inside .
Serpico : A Name That Became Famous	There have so many crooked-cops-themed films in the past 30 years that this film has lost a lot of its shock-and-awe . The long hair , wild clothes , beads , etc . really date this film , too , it being so early ' 70s in looks . It's almost become a " period piece " as if it were the Roaring Twenties except its the Sleazy Seventies . All you have to do is look at the party scene in here and you'll get a glimpse at the early ' 70s , and most of it is not good . What IS good is Al Pacino's acting , of course . There have been very few films in which he starred that didn't displaying his acting talents to the fullest . This one , along with Dog Day Afternoon and few others , put him " on the map , " making him a big star . He's been a " star " ever since . This is a fairly long film but , like Pacino , it's rarely boring . The name of Pacino's character , " Serpico , " has become synonymous with " honest cop . " It demonstrates what a strong impact this movie had on millions of people . Gritty ? Yes . Profane ? Yes ; Memorable ? Most definitely . When you speak of modern-day " classics , " this film is one of them .
Retirement For A Good Cop	The neatest part about this show might have been the ending on the " Stolen Life " story , which takes place in Dallas . It was neat because it was different . The crime story had wrapped up and a veteran officer , a very cool guy named P . E . Jones , had just retired and they gave him a party . It was very touching . I forget the exact number , but I think he had served for about 35 years in the police force and had been a very good detective . The young guys all admired him . Jones and his peers got called out at 1 a . m . after a 911 call about a man shot next to a truck . " I won't miss being called out in the middle of the night anymore , " says a sleepy Jones , as he races to the scene . The man next to the pickup truck was dead . Soon , they find a witness who had seen the shooting and had run away . She told police she had gone with this 63-year-old man in his truck when someone approached them , demanded the victim's money , and then shot him . She fled in panic , she said . Police wonder if she didn't set up this homicide . Three things help solve this case : a palm print off the truck , a tip involving two suspects and finding the victim's wallet in a sewer drain . Police wind up sending the S . W . A . T . team out to get one of the suspects . This is a pretty interesting story . The first case originates from Cincinnati , Ohio . This is the first time I've seen a case from that city . Sad to say , a bunch of neighborhood volunteers , trying to help keep order in a violent neighborhood , organize a day of youth football and call it " The Peace Bowl . " After a few games had been played , shots are heard nearby and a 19-year-old is killed . Despite a street full of onlookers , because of the football games , no one is talking . Finally , someone does and it leads them to a man who is caught , then denies any involvement , but then breaks down and admits it . That's not unusual in this show , and it's always dramatic , because it's real and the shooter , usually in tears , knows his life is over , as he knows it . Of course , so is the person he shot .
Totally Implausible But A Fun ' Ride '	The crime is the secondary story in this episode . The main story is Monk seeing his father for the first time in 39 years and how the two slowly re-establish ties Dan Hedaya , one of the better characters of our era , plays " Jack Monk , " a long-haired sleazy-looking 68-year-old truck driver . The murder case , which is shown primarily in the introduction , is one where a guy doesn't actually commit homicide but stands by and watches his nemesis accidentally kill himself and does nothing to prevent it , when he could have helped . In this case , he helps the accident finish off the guy by making sure the victim doesn't have a foothold when the man is choking as his tie is caught in the engine . The tie-in , pun intended , is that the elder Monk also drives truck for this company and his boss-murderer . Monk , believe-it-or-not , reluctantly takes a long trip in his dad's big truck to Phoenix because Capt . Stottlemeyer convinces him this may be his only shot to ever connect with his dad . By the way , I've watched every episode up to this one and Monk would never go anywhere without all his necessities . . . . but , that's the story here . This one then blends humor , sentimentality , and suspense at the end as the two men's lives are in danger in the truck when it speeds down a mountain with no breaks ! In all , a very flawed because of so many things that are out of character here , but a very entertaining episode , and that's why we watch isn't it ? I give it high marks , simply for the entertainment . Hedaya was riveting and weird but then again , what male isn't strange in the Monk family ? Speaking of that , I wish we'd see Adrian's brother " Ambrose " again . JohnTurturro was hilarious in that role .
A Second Look , With Subtitles In Parts , Made This Much Better	I didn't really appreciate this second installment of the LOTR trilogy until I watched this for the second time . The key was how I looked at the key character of this film : " Gollum " ( Andy Serkis . ) . Once I began to appreciate and marvel at this weasel-like character , my opinion of the film went from bad to good . That doesn't mean I like that slimy creature : I don't , but I am more fascinated by him rather than totally annoyed as I was with the first viewing . A big reason was that I put on the English subtitles , so I was able to understand everything he said . I recommend doing that you has a similar problem deciphering his dialog . Now I more fully understood what a tortured soul that pathetic creature was . Anyway , this second installment , as in the first , offers a lot of fascinating sights and sounds and a nice varied platter of action scenes and wild characters . For younger kids , I am to happy to say there is absolutely nothing , language-wise , that would offend anyone but the violence is heavy and brutal at times . This is a solid , highly-recommended second installment in the trilogy . It's epic film-making . No , it may not be equal to the first - The Fellowship Of The Ring - but what adventure story is ?
Unique Mouths Still Make Me Laugh	This was the third in a series of three short BBC programs featuring Wallace and his pet dog Gromit . I thought the three films got better and better as went along , this being the best of the three . There are some very clever and entertaining scenes in the 30-miunte movie . the color also was good - nice animation . Of course , it's only gotten better and better since these were made , capped off recently by a full-length Wallace & Gromit film . I don't think I ever stop laughing looking at the mouths on Wallace and the woman he likes in this story . Wallace is a window cleaner and " Wendolene " is the object of his affections . Unfortunately , both the woman and her pet dog are not good " people . " In fact , her pet dog , " Preston " frames poor Gromit for sheep-rustling and winds up in jail . Wallace must rescue him . A subplot involves Wallace and his love of cheese . It's all silly , of course , but very entertaining and the best of the three short Wallace & Gromit animated films of the period ( 1989-1993 ) , in my opinion .
Lot Of Fun & Imaginative	This ancient Felix cartoon just about skips the opening credits . Obviously those couldn't be salvaged . Anyway , we first see Felix in the cemetery where he soon meets up with some ghosts . Felix and the ghosts throw stones at each other , and then Felix follows one to a barn . We see the ghost terrorize a donkey . He then goes back in and does the same to a bunch of pigs . All of them race out of the barn in terror , too . This is a very bizarre looking , primitive in the drawings but that's what you expect for a 1923 cartoon . Things really get weird when the ghost suddenly appears in the upstairs bedroom of the farmer . The poor man is shaking in his boots . The ghost first tickles but then makes threatening gestures . Felix is outside the window taking in all of this . Finally , the man gets on the telephone and says , " Help ! Send in the reserves . There's a ghost in the house . " What happens after that isn't exactly " Ghostbusters , " but it is funny and this is a wild cartoon , start to finish . I liked how the " ghost " ( and you'll know why I put that in quotes if you see this cartoon ) suddenly appears - in a flash ! Felix , by the way , calls himself " a ghost - breaker . " Considering the year this was done , this is pretty inventive animation . This was very enjoyable to watch . This cartoon was part of a collection of in the " Presenting Felix The Cat - The Otto Messmer Classics - 1919-1924 " DVD , with original organ scores by Dave Wickersham .
Jerry Is Definitely The Hero In This One	Many times I question who the real good guy is in these Tom and Jerry cartoons because sometimes Jerry is violent to the point of being sadistic . . . . but there's no doubt that he's the " good guy " in this story . Jerry is trying to save a little goldfish from being part of a meal for Tom . Tom had been listening to the radio ( remember , this was pre-television days when everyone sat by their big radios ) and hearing a French chef describe a fantastic fish dinner . It had Tom salivating . The chef says , " and finally the most important ingredient : one small , fresh fish . " In seconds Tom realizes there is a goldfish in the house . His demeanor turns from sweet , lovable pussycat to Jeffrey Dahmer . The rest of the story has Jerry trying the rescue the little fish from being boiled , filleted , barbecued and toasted . There are some excellent sight gags in here , like Jerry walking through Tom's head to get to his mouse hole , using Tom's teeth like a pair of window shades and other far-out scenes . Tom gets literally " bent out of shape " a number of times , but he deserved each one of them in this episode . Overall , a lot of laughs and one of the better Tom and Jerry cartoons .
" Funny , Cute , Touching and Overall Very Entertaining Disney Effort	For much of this film , even though I was being entertained by it , I thought it was geared mostly for kids . . . . . and that's fine . That's what I always thought the target audience was in animated films . I just got spoiled with so many good ones in the last few years that also had a lot of funny material that adults enjoyed , too . Films like " Cars , " " Madagascar , " " Barnyard . " " Chicken Little , " " The Polar Express , " and so forth . Well , in the end , I have nothing but praise for this film , too , because it had some touching qualities to it that would emotionally involve a person of any age . This simply turned out to be - at least for me as an adult - a really nice film with a heartfelt message of friendship , family and a sense of belonging . At the same time , it still had enough jokes , charm and colorful animation to make it interesting all the way . The film goes from so-so kid stuff to very good as soon as our hero " Lewis " and his new friend " Wilbur " go into the latter's world : the future . The most amusing segments of the film revolve around the Robinson family , an eccentric but extremely loving group . That family makes this film tick and , hopefully , we'll see more of them in some future feature-length film . These guys - The Robinsons - are just too entertaining to have their movie " careers " end with only this one film . The story brings out a very thought-provoking theme to ponder . How would you react if , as a 12-year-old boy , you could meet yourself as an adult perhaps 25 years later . . . . and vice-versa ? How incredibly strange that would be ? Or to see yourself face-to-face as a small baby ? This movie really digs into deep territory in the last third , which is why , as an adult , I found it getting better and better right to the end .
How Do They Do It ? Only God Knows	In this program , which is more like a nature one than the usual " Modern Marvels , " we see how some amazing homes built by beavers , bees , birds , termites , ants and spiders . How these creatures know how to do everything they do by instinct baffles the writers of the show . I guess they don't believe in the powers of the One who created all of them . It's the only explanation , but , whatever , it's all fascinating . For instance , seeing how much goes into a beaver creating his " lodge " or a big " dam " is incredible in itself . I never realized how huge these things were . In fact , it's mentioned here that " they are the largest structures created by any animal . " In Montana , someone found a beaver-made dam that stretched 2 , 100 feet ! The key to the bees ' ( and wasps ' ) hives are the hexagonal shape which , apparently , is ideal ( " most efficient , " it's said here ) for structures . We even use it in space ships . Bees , with the was in their bodies , form millions and millions of these little hexagons in their hives . Wasps do similar but don't have wax . They have to use a mixture of saliva and plant fibers they gather . We've all seen bird's nest , and they show some unusual ones in this program . I found it interesting to hear that birds aren't too good at this on their first attempt , but by the second and third years , their homes are much better . Ants , of course , build entire cities and do incredible work with super strength but termites are really interesting : at least the ones in African grasslands and the Australian outback . These structures go up in the air , sometimes 10 to 20 feet . They may take 10 years to build . That was the most amazing sight I saw on this program , which finished with the incredible work spiders do in spinning their silk webs . What I didn't know was that many times the spider will destroy what he / she worked on all day , eat the web , recycle it in their bodies and weave another one the next day !
Entertaining ' Anthology ' Of Clapton	These are videos of the hits of both Eric Clapton and some of the early bands he was in such as " The Yardbirds " and " Cream . " It guess you could call this an " anthology " as it shows the famous guitarist-singer from the early ' 60s through the ' 80s when this tape was made . Whatever the era , it's simply good rock ' n roll music . Most tunes , even the very early stuff in which I didn't recognize the ultra-young , thin and beardless Clapton , are still good to hear and his guitar work has always been a pleasure . With each video , Clapton's appearance really changes . When the video switches to color and to stereo , it really picks up steam . " Layla , " " Cocaine , " " Forever Man , " and a " Tearing Us Apart " were the highlights for me . The latter was a duet with Tina Turner . " Layla " is uniquely done in that they mix several concert tapings into the song , but keep it cohesive . The last two songs aren't much so I end it with that duet with Turner . It makes the video end on a high note .
Nothing Like Some Good ' Italian Food ! '	I've always found this a " guilty pleasure , " an extremely entertaining profane-gross-funny film about a female vampire who likes " Italian food , " meaning she likes to kill members of the Mafia ! ! I am a bit partial in favor of this movie , anyway , because I am fan of Anne Parillaud . She starred in two of my favorite films : Map Of The Human Heart and Frankie Starlight . To me , she's always great to look at listen to , especially with a comedy here . This is about as good as she's ever looked . I also enjoyed her narration . Also , with director John Landis , you almost always get a very entertaining movie . The special effects in here are fun to watch and the general off-the-wall humor is great . If you appreciate dark humor , you'll like this movie . The filmmakers also did not go overlong on the action scenes . The film is almost a put-on about vampire movies . The negatives are too much profanity , too much for a comedy . It sometimes gets ridiculous . Robert Loggia plays most of the profane characters I've ever heard on film , yet is very funny at times . The gore is overdone in parts , too , but nowadays - even watching television ( i . e . CSI ) - we're used to that now . My other complaint is why this DVD is not on widescreen . Why is it only offered in pan-and-scan ? If you don't mind blood , guts and foul language , this is a hilarious film .
Fredericksburg , Grant , Proclamation , Stonewall & More	The North puts on a valiant , courageous effort in storming Fredericksburg but loses over 10 , 000 men in what really amounted to a suicide mission . The South continues to win key battles mainly because the North has such inept generals , according to this Ken Burns TV documentary . Finally , after numerous strategic mistakes by Northern military leaders , Lincoln turns to Ulysses S . Grant to lead the Union . Conditions continue to be brutal , not just for the undermanned but for the North . Food and supplies are scarce and costly . Men are going AWOL by the thousands The Emancipation Proclamation has made Lincoln very unpopular , both with the South and North . Thousands of blacks are shipped off to Texas , so they don't wind up fighting against the South . ( Reportedly , there are many northern sympathizers in the South and they fight for the Union . ) Thomas " Stonewall " Jackson dies midway through the year , a huge loss for the Confederates . Next to General Robert E . Lee , Jackson is the most beloved soldier the South had , I believe . ( See the motion picture , " Gods and Generals , " by the way , for a thorough look at Jackson . )
Couldn't Fill His Father's Shoes So He Kills His Mom ?	One of the most interesting facts brought out in this City Confidential episode was that Tyler , Texas , never suffered through the Great Depression . While the rest of the USA went through that horrible period in the 1930s , Tyler flourished and did quite nicely , thank you . This city never had any hard financial times until the late ' 80s when this particular crime story featured on this show took place . Tyler , known for growing millions and millions of roses , hit the jackpot with " black gold " ( oil ) in the ' 30s . Soon , 3 , 600 wells were up-and-gushing in this East Texas area . After that , there was a big Army training base at Tyler and many , many soldiers were so impressed with the friendliness of the area ( including a lot of new girlfriends ) that they came back and settled here after World War II . Tyler just kept on booming . Few people made a bigger success out of their business than Baker Lucas II , who built houses and provided real estate for these WWII vets and the Baby Boomers . A very likable guy , Lucas quickly rose to the top , had a wonderful home , a new baby boy , joined the richest country club and ran for mayor . He was elected , and re-elected . Nobody enjoyed his success more than his wife Bette , who spent her days on the Tyler social scene while taking a lot of time for shopping , getting her nails and hair done all the time and looking and acting as glamorous as she could . While good at social climbing , she wasn't good as a mother . Being a mother hindered her social activities . She once told her young son Steve that she wished she'd had an abortion and never had the kid . That's nice to hear when you're young ! Steve left town when he was adult , trying to see if could make it on his own . His daddy's shadow was too big and his mom - well , no love lost there . Disaster struck the Lucas family ( the date was never mentioned ) when the elder Lucas was in a car crash and died suddenly . His wife was lost without her husband's business sense , money , moral support and standing in the community . In 1986 , her son Steve came back , with his family , to Tyler to see if you could revive his father's real estate business . He couldn't , being a poor worker and one with poor business sense . He couldn't fill his old man's shoes and soon was sponging thousands of dollars off his mother . When the mom got tired of giving Steve money and decided to cut him out of her will , another tragedy struck . He says it was an accident , that the mom was carrying a VCR up the stairs at home , tumbled down them and was killed . Most other people think it was no accident , that this woman was so spoiled that she never carried anything in her life , much less a VCR up a lot of stairs . Cause of death was " blunt force trauma " and prosecutors think a brass candlestick was used to beat the woman to death . In November of 1988 , Steve was charged with murder . The trial , in 1991 , wound up as a hung jury , eight voting to convict . . The re-trial was moved to Dallas , thinking Tyler was too involved to hold another trial there . Lucas made out poorly in the second trial , convicted of murder and sentenced to 35 years in prison . Meanwhile , on a more pleasant note , people who live in Tyler , Texas , sure love it . . . . at least all the ones interviewed on this program . They think this " self-proclaimed rose capital of the world " ( as narrator Paul Winfield puts it with is normal sarcasm ) is about as good as it gets . They love the town , the annual Rose Festival - which has always been a very big deal and the nice-looking town " which is more whispering willow than Old West . " One wishes Mrs . Lucas could whisper back from the grave and confirm whether her death was an accident or murder .
All You Want - Or Need - To Know About This Bizarre Movie	This 76-minute behind-the-scenes documentary is broken into five sections : Development , Production , Special-Makeup Effects , Music and Reaction . They all run anywhere from 13 to 21 minutes apiece to give a comprehensive look at this controversial film dealing with the infamous fictional serial killer " Hannibal Lecter . " PRODUCTION - For Dino DeLaurentis and his daughter Martha , things didn't look too good at the start . They were dying to make the movie but their direction Jonathan Demme , who did " Silence Of the Lambs " didn't want any part of this and neither did the star actor , Anthony Hopkins . Mr . Hopkins during this time , you may recall , announced in 1998 he was through with acting . He also read Tom Harris's ' book " Hannibal " and thought it was " too bizarre . " Yet , things worked out as Ridley Scott was talked into reading the book and loved it and agreed to director , and Hopkins changed his mind when he knew they had another great director and a tremendous screenwriter in Steve Z , whom DeLaurentis said " is the best writer in the industry . " They weren't able to retain the services of the other costar of " Silence , " Jodie Foster , but were pleased to get Julianne Moore for the role . Hopkins favored her among five leading candidates because he had prior filming experience with her , and liked her . In another interesting note , Hopkins was shown signing autographs as the Italian crowd all swarmed him . " I fee like Mick Jagger or Sting , " Hopkins joked . PRODUCTION - This dealt with the city of Florence is just magnificent , with its centuries-old architecture , Tuscan hills in the background , just a beautiful place . Actress Francesca Neri said it " is really the heart of Italy . " Filming there was made difficult because of all the tourists . " There are more tourists there , literally , than residents , " someone observed . They also showed some interesting shots of the infamous scene in which Ray Liotta's character is having his brains eaten . Liotta had to make a body cast of himself , so there was a perfect duplicate of him also sitting at the table which we viewers never saw . It was dummy's brains that were taken , not Ray's , thankfully ! Liotta said it was the eeriest feeling ever to sit there and look at himself across the table . It really freaked him out . MAKEUP - They all had nothing but highest praise for working with Ridley Scott . The biggest challenge , of course , was the character of Mason Verger . " It was tough ; everything wee did looked like a zombie until we finally could get something realistic looking . " commented Greg Cannom , of special makeup effectsPoor Gary Oldman , who had to endure five hours of makeup each time and another one for clothing - six hours of preparation to look like Verger . Also discussed are some of the other big effects scenes , some of them too disgusting to even talk about , like the pigs eating a human . This film was not for the squeamish , as you know , if you've seen it . MUSIC - Hans Zimmer , the composer , is the main man interviewed in this segment . He , too , laughs and jokes and remarks how he enjoys working with Scott . Both men explain how they go about their work and how it affects the film . By the way , check out Zimmer's resume . I can't believe how many " name " films he's scored . REACTION - This a fun , stargazing segment as we saw all the film participants except Scott ( who's mom had just died ) at a premier screening in Hollywood and then another in New York City . There were tons of recognizable faces and the comments by some of actors , like Hopkins , were interesting .
The Endless Search For Water	It's understandable if you get thirsty watching this episode . All the creatures in the desert , it seems , spend most or all spend their time looking for water , to survive . When water does arrive , in the form of a shower , or a flash flood from miles away , the animals and birds get busy and drink as much of it as they can . Some places rarely see moisture . There are some incredible things , though , in deserts around the world . In one place , fog provides the only moisture , and that's for about one hour before the sun bakes it off . However , it is noted by narrator David Attenborough , that " it is not the heat or lack of water which kills most life in the desert : it is lack of food . " Some of the best sights , for those of viewing this series on DVD , include fantastic aerial shots of long sand dunes . The smoothness and shapes , I think , are some of the prettiest sights on this planet .
Memorable Modern Noir	This was the Coen Brothers first movie and I think it might rank second-best to more-famous " Fargo . " This is suspenseful neo-noir ( modern-day film noir ) filled with fun direction by the Coens : low camera angles , closeups , concentration of sounds such as the whirring of an overhead fan , some dramatic pauses , strange characters and even stranger events taking place . The only thing missing I'd like to have is 5 . 1 surround sound . Warning : some bloody scenes in here are downright gross , but they sure produce some memorable scenes . Character-wise , Dan Hedeya proves to be the toughest man to kill I've ever seen in a movie ! Frances McDormand is young and looks pretty , the best I've ever seen her look . John Getz's character is strange and sometimes to frustrating to watch and Emmet Walsh is outstanding at playing the sleazy private detective . Those four , along with Samm-Art Williams , comprise almost all the speaking parts in this film . This is an involving movie . Once started , you're hooked on this strange story . I wish the Coens would have made more movies like this .
How They Let This ' Low-Life ' Go Is Mind-Boggling	This is the worst verdict I've seen yet , in the 30-or-so episodes I've watched of this program . It makes me totally lose faith in the jury system . You wonder : " what are these people thinking ? " ere , a man with 16 charges against him including eyewitnesses who saw him shoot and kill a man , and then drive off in a stolen police car . . . . . got off , on all counts ! Unbelievably , Daniel Martinez , beat the rap , thanks to a high-profiled and slick lawyer who obviously fooled a stupid jury . Martinez , everyone agreed , was the town " low-life , " a guy with a rap sheet " longer than the Rio Grande , " as narrator Paul Winfield puts it . Martinez wound up playing both sides of the fence : a full-time criminal and a snitch for the police . The combination didn't work out , and a " Good Samaritan , " wound up losing his life because of it . The details of the story I'll leave for you to discover by watching this episode . I didn't understand another thing : why the victim in the case just simply didn't call the police instead of slipping out of his house in the middle of the night to investigate a woman's screams and other suspicious noises . Well , his heart was in the right place . The history of this criminal , the Sante Fe police department , which didn't come off looking good , either , and a fascinating look at " The City Different , " comprise this hour-long show . Sante Fe , one of the art capitals of the U . S . , looks fascinating but it's not just one long art festival . It has crime , just like everywhere and by the early ' 90s , the rapes and murders came were highlighted by this bizarre case . Oddly , justice did prevail a year later . . . . but not concerning this case .
An Entertaining Political Thriller . . . . . Period !	I enjoyed this film . I thought it was an excellent political thriller about something that's never happened before - a Secret Service agent going bad and involved in an assassination plot . Unfortunately , for Michael Douglas ' character , " Pete Garrison , " they think HE's the mole but he isn't . He's just a morally-flawed agent having an affair with the First Lady ! Since he's doing that , he's unable to give an acceptable polygraph exam and that makes him suspect number one when it's revealed there is a plot to kill the President . " Garrison " is forced to go on the lam but at the same time he's still trying to do the right thing by protecting the President . Douglas does a fine job in this role . I don't always care the people he plays but he's an excellent actor . Keifer Sutherland ( " David Breckinridge " ) is equally as good ( at least in here ) as the fellow SS boss who hunts down Douglas until convinced he has been telling the truth . When he does the two of them work together in the finale to discover and then stop , if they can , the plot . The crooks are interesting , too , by the way . Also , I have never - and never will , unfortunately - see a First Lady who looks as good as Kim BasingerThis is simply a slick action flick that entertains start-to-finish . Are there holes in it ? Of course ; probably a number of them , and a reason you see so many critical comments . However , it is unfairly bashed here . It just isn't intelligent enough for the geniuses here on this website . My advice : chill , just go along for the ride and enjoy all the action and intrigue . Yes , it gets a little Rambo-ish at the end but otherwise it gets high marks for entertainment . . . . . which is what movies are all about .
The Film That Made Brooks A Star	Mel Brooks made several very popular and memorable films in the ' 70s but I doubt any was more popular than this one . Made just several years after the morals ' code had been lifted in Hollywood , it was able to provide humor in a new and shocking way . People could fart , swear , have old ladies use the n - word , men could punch horses in the face , make fun of any religion , creed , race or whatever was there to make fun of . . . in other words , no holds barred when it came to trying to get a laugh . Nothing was sacred at this time in Hollywood history and few capitalized on this as well as Brooks , especially with this film . The film doesn't have much shock value anymore but it's still fun to watch and probably always will be , thanks to the outrageous characterizations in here . On the negative side , especially if don't know Brooks does whatever he can to get a laugh and isn't all that political , this film might be too politically-correct with its reverse racism , bias against religion and overly crude situations . But - a big but - there are so many funny lines in here , so many funny scenes you never forget and never fail to laugh no matter how many times you see it ( the campfire scene alone has made men cry in laughter for 30 years ) that you can overlook about anything in here . In summary , a true " classic " guaranteed to entertain for many more years to come .
A Bit Confusing But Always Fascinating	No sense going into a detailed review describing what this film is about because there are enough reviews already . I'll just say it took me several viewings to finally figure out what was going on . It's not an easy to story to follow . It's also unusual : a crime story dealing with rights to water . To many people , that's odd but water has always been a precious commodity in southern California . There is nothing confusing about how this film looks . It's a treat for one's eyes , especially if you love that 1940s look , which I do . This movie just drips with Los Angeles film noir atmosphere : a rich-looking piece of cinema with great period detail . What stands out in most people's memory of this film is another odd thing : a man's nose getting sliced . Here , it's Jack Nicholson getting a " nose job " courtesy of some thugs . Jack , playing " Jake Gittes , " will forever be known ( among wild roles ) as the guy with a bandage on his nose , thanks to this movie . As interesting as he is , along with Faye Dunaway and the rest of the cast , I always get a kick out of seeing John Huston in here . I love the way he sounds and acts , and I'm sorry he had such a short role . Overall , an always-fascinating film no matter how many times you watch it or how well you understand it .
Emma Can Break Your Heart	Wow , here's an emotional story that gets you involved and wears you out by the end . I wears you out not from action , but from watching two good ladies suffer heartbreaks one after the other . This is not my normal viewing fare but I am big fan of two things this movie has to offer : ( 1 ) Emma Thompson and ( 2 ) incredible visuals . Few people were better in the 1990s at playing the sensible-sweet-wholesome and pretty and-always unfairly ignored woman than Thompson ( see The Remains Of The Day and Howards End ) . Your heart aches for this woman whose characters always deserve better than what they receive . . Her facial expressions alone convey pain better than anyone I've ever seen on film . This is perhaps her best work and it was justice she was honored for it . It was refreshing to see Alan Rickman actually place a nice guy and Kate Winslet was appealing , too - a far cry from spoiled brat role in the film that gave her stardom , Titantic . One tip that I found useful in watching this movie . If you are not British , you might switch on the English subtitles to better understand the dialog and the phraseology of early 19th century England , in which this story takes place . The only problem with using the subtitles is that it detracts from marveling at these visuals . This is one of the prettiest films I have ever seen , on both the inside and outside scenes . It's just gorgeous cinematography frame after frame with beautiful colors . Nice music score , too . This kind of story is a bit too soap opera-like for my normal tastes but to watch Thompson and to ogle the colors , sets and scenery makes it all a rewarding experience . For women who like these kind of Jane Austen stories , this must really be a special film . For the rest of us , it's still very much worth seeing , and adding to one's DVD collection . It''s great film-making .
Powerful , Involving Story	This is one powerful film . The first time I saw it , the Scottish accents made it tough for me to understand a lot and that ruined the viewing experience . I gave up on it but then acquired the DVD , used the English subtitles when I needed them , and really got into this movie , discovering just how good it is . It is excellent . The widescreen picture makes it spectacular in parts , with some wonderful rugged scenery and the story reminded me of Braveheart , an involving tale of good versus evil . Here , it's Liam Neeson ( good ) vs . Tim Roth ( evil ) . Both do their jobs well . Few actors come across as despicable as Roth . Man , you really want to smack this guy in his arrogant , irritating puss . ( He is so nasty and vile the sick critics love his character more than anyone else's here ) . Neeson is a man's man and a solid hero figure as Gibson was in Braveheart . Jessica Lange is strong in here as the female lead . The movie draws you in and gets you totally involved , so prepared to have an emotional experience viewing this .
One Of The Best In The Series	Up until the sixth and last episode of the Star Wars saga , which finally ended in 2005 , I had always looked at this 1983 entry as my favorite film of the long-running series . The varied action scenes and really different characters ( Jabba The Hut , furry woodland creatures , etc . ) made this a particularly appealing movie . None of the action ever focused too long in one spot , either . The last half hour exemplifies this the most as the scene switches every few minutes from the woods to the battle among space ships to the individual laser-duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader . Another nice characteristic this film had that the two previous did not was the absence of in-fighting between two of the stars . Gone was the incessant bickering between Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford . Finally , everyone was on the same page ! It was nice to see . In the end , this was simply a wonderful adventure tale , more than anything else .
Great Start To A Classic TV Series	Not having seen this show in over 40 years and having loved it as a young teen , I couldn't wait for the DVD to finally come out with Season One . I am sorry it's only half of the opening season , but at least it's a start . This was great to watch , right from the beginning , because , for those like me who have forgotten or for new viewers , it gives us the background of all the major players . We get quick profiles of the men who were called " The Untouchables , " beginning with the leader " Elliot Ness , " a role that brought a lot of fame to actor Robert Stack . Stack had already starred in several melodramas in the mid ' 50s but this TV series really made him a star . His right-hand man on the show , " Enrico Rossi , " wasn't on the team right away , as I re-discovered watching this . Rossi ( Nicholas Georgiade ) was an assistant barber , who witnessed a brutal massacre in his shop and then had " the moxie , " as Ness put it , to confront one of the thugs and be willing to testify against Frank Nitti . Ness is so impressed he hires Rossi shortly afterward on a conditional basis . The opening episode re-unites us with Bruce Gordon as Nitti , " The Enforcer " as he was labeled . He's the chief villain since Al Capone has just been put in jail . We see Nitti try to take charge over the other three major hoods , but is stopped by the much smarter bookkeeper " Jake Guzik " ( Nehemiah Persoff ) , who persuades Nitti and the two others - " Phil D'Andrea and Fur Sammons " - not to make the mistakes Capone made . They'll keep Capone's chair empty ( hence the title of this episode ) and run things smarter as a group . Meanwhile , Ness and his boys try to figure out how to get Nitti charged in the murder . That's difficult because the other witness , the head barber , won't testify he saw anything . How can they get Nitti ? If not this crime , maybe on tax evasion , or maybe they can start the crooks to mistrust each other . That's the theme for the rest of the program : how to send Nitti and his boys to jail . It also was fun to see guest star Barbara Nichols who plays " Brandy LaFrance . " If that name doesn't suit the roles Barbara played here and in many other TV programs and movies , nothing does .
So Far , The Most Interesting Episode Of The Season	Most of the CSI shows try to grab you with some sensational opening shot , and this one certainly does as a man's parachute fails and he crashes to his death in the middle of Manhattan . The thing is , he was a professional and someone caused this death to happen . It's especially puzzling when a bunch of dead racing pigeons are found on the ground with the victim ! Soon , we find a racing pigeon owner dead in his rooftop coop , with a wound that looks like someone put a buzz-saw to his neck . " Mac " and the crew finds out the guy was in the FBI's witness protection outfit . The secondary story involves a super-rich family that had a lavish birthday party for their 16 - year-old girl where daddy's big present was a new $60 , 000 car . Unfortunately , at the unveiling daddy was in the driver's seat and dead . When the CSI team comes to investigate , they open the car door and a cobra inside strikes and bites Lyndsay ! An ambulance comes for her but we discover quickly that she will be fine . Soon , we find out the girl's brother put the snake in the car as a prank . This episode , as you can tell reading all of this , is full of odd occurrences , one weird finding after another and very , very interesting . No sense going into all the facets of these crimes but this is a highly-recommended , maybe the best one of the season so far .
Fantastic - Really Good Sight Gags	After the first few minutes it looked like this was going to be a fairly weak Popeye cartoon but - wow - it got terrific and stayed that way until the end . The attraction : a lot of legitimately funny and clever sight gags . There is no Bluto in this one , which is a nice change-of-pace but we have a villain , a mustachioed-guy who looks like the old silent-era villain " Oil Can Harry " who would tie up women and leave them on the railroad tracks . Here , this villain is handcuffed early on by Wimpy , who is a cop , believe it or not . However , predictably , Wimpy is inept and quickly he loses the criminal he has handcuffed to him when he gets distracted by - you guessed it - hamburgers . The crook just happens to have a coat full of skeleton keys and other escape mechanisms so he splits and heads for the nearby Popeye's Pawn Shop That's where the real fun starts and I wouldn't want to spoil it . Suffice to say you see a lot of wild scenes between the criminal , Popeye and Olive and some duels you can't believe . The name of this cartoon refers to all the various weapons these guys use in their duels . To this day , this is a very original material which I haven't seen on any other cartoons .
Series Gets Off To An interesting Start	In the opening segment of this first-of - 10 episode set , a bunch of recording artists describe rock ' n roll . I like best what guitarist Rick Osasek of " The Cars " said : " Juvenile delinquents played rock ' n roll in the ' 50s and wore leather jackets ; in the ' 60s hippies played it ; in the ' 70s there was juvenile delinquents but that was an old word so they called it ' punk ; ' then they cleaned it up with New Wave and they put on a tie . . . . . . but it's all about music and songs , ya know ? Whatever songs are popular at the time . " For the remainder of the hour , we see and hear presentations by a number of singers , some extremely famous like Michael Jackson , Bruce Springsteen , The Rolling Stones ( ' 64 - wow does Mick Jagger look young ! ) , Jimi Hendrix and more . Personally , the ones I enjoyed the most were Elvis Presley singing " Money Honey ; " Muddy Waters doing " Got My Mojo Working ; " Buddy Holly on " That'll Be The Day ; " Little Richard doing a gospel number and later " Ready Teddy ; " Ruth Brown's " Mama , He Treats Your Daughter Mean ; " Louis Jordan's " Caledonia ; " Joe Turner's " Shake , Rattle and Roll ; " Ray Charles on " I Got A Woman ; " Chuck Berry's " Mabelline ; ' Pat Boone doing " Tutti Fruitti , " and Billy Haley and The Comets , " Rock Around The Clock . " I thought I knew R & R history but had forgotten that Jordan was the real " father of rock ' n roll " in the 1940s . I was surprised to hear Jagger say he and Kieth Richards liked country music as much as blues . Speaking of the British , it was a bit shocking to see how Bill Haley was so big in England , provoking riots and everything ! The longest and nicest tribute in here was for Ray Charles , who could sing anything and make it sound special .
You Wouldn't Want To Meet Either Of These Two Creatures !	This was my first look at this series the Animal Planet Network's new " Mutual Of Omaha's Wild Kingdom " has in which they pit two animals against each other . It's not literal - there is no " match " in which the two animals actually fight each other , but they make it a contest with 10 categories . They grade each animal on which is better in each category and then total up the scores to see who is the winner . This contest had two big and scary contestants : the hippopotamus verses the Nile Alligator . The place : Zambia , Africa . The following 10 categories comprised this " Rumble In The River : " 1 - Weapons ; 2 - Feeding ; 3 - Locomotion ; 4 - Climate ; 5 - Size ; 6 - Parent Power ; 7 - Teamwork ; 8 - Natural Born Killers ; 9 - Enemies ; 10 - Final Showdown . Some of these categories may not sound like much , but they were very interesting . Some of the memorable scenes or statements : The hippo can open his huge mouth with jaws almost 180 degrees apart and a few of his teeth are two feet long . . . . . If his breath doesn't kill you , his teeth will ! . . . . . . The hippo can run 30 miles per hour if it needs to sprint . Not bad for a 7 , 000-pound animal . . . . . Climate greatly affects the alligator . It needs heat , which is why you see them bathing in the sun for hours . If cold , the reptile almost loses its eyesight . . . . Alligators are much better team players . . . . . Hippos are very aggressive and kill at least 200 people each year . Gators kill at least 100 . . . . . The Nile Alligator can hold its breath up to one hour underwater . . . . . the greatest threats to each or members of their own species . These involve almost all the fights ( i . e . hippos vs . hippos ) but the biggest threat to their existence are humans , of course . There are about 150 , 000 hippos left in the wilds and about a half million of these alligators . . . . . Only one in 50 baby alligators survives . Many times other gators eat all the young . Who wins ? Watch the program ; it's an absolutely fascinating one . You will never forget some of the images you see of these two scary beasts . Just hope that you never run into either one of them !

A re-construction of the face reveals the stunning discovering that the victim is " Aiden Burn , " the CSI member from last year's show . Who killed her and why ?
