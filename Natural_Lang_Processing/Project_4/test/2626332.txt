This Is HORRID !	Salma Hayek is quirky and delightful in this work , but let me ask you a question : With a title like Breaking Up , did you really expect them to work it out ? WHO in their right mind would want to be with a man like Crowe ! ? ! All too often , his characters are rude , crude , abusive , and psychotic . It leads me to believe he plays these roles so often because there is something inside him , which identifies with this type of man . Indeed . News reports would tend to corroborate this opinion . The story is dull and uneventful , and the execution is pretty lame . Again , Hayek was great , but she can't do a " couples " movie alone and have it work . Crowe just plain sucks as an actor . This is a crapfest , and as such , rates a NOTHING from . . . the Fiend : .
Lost Opportunity	It Could Have Been A Marvelous Story Based On The Ancient Races Of Cat People , but it wasn't . This work could have been just that ; marvelous and replete with mythological references which kept my fascination fueled . The lead characters ( Charles Brady played by Brian Krause ; and his mother Mary , played by Alice Krige ) were shallowly done , had no depth of personality and were hardly likable or drawing . Not even MÃ¤dchen Amick ( who played Tanya Robertson ) ' s character fit into that description . However , as I've said many times before , when you adapt a Stephen King novel for TV , you simply must take into account the fact that his books aren't written for TV , and his screenplay talent sadly lacks the fire and depth he exhibits as a novelist . This is another botched attempt to take the magick of Stephen King writing , whether that is of his novels or an original screenplay . To simply cut and paste his work onto the small screen . His novels get completely bastardized in the process and all you end up creating is a nice movie ; nothing less but certainly nothing more . His screenplays are hit and miss . Unfortunately , this screenplay translation was a miss . Sorry , Sorry , Sorry movie . This movie gets a from . . . the Fiend : .
Mournfully bad !	This movie was about the worst of the Disney sequels . I've come to expect the next to crayon-drawing graphics , the total absence of background scenery , the complete loss of depth to the characters and the inane story lines from Disney sequels , but this one wins the old " Fickle Finger of Fate " award from Rowan & Martin's " Laugh-In . " It was worse than all that . It was a major disappointment . It lost every inch of the charm the original had , and really was a monumental waste of my time and money in purchasing this lamoid piece of garbage . Stitch was as badly drawn as anything on a 5 year old's mother's refrigerator ; worse even , as were the other characters , scenery , architecture and backdrops in this " animation . " ( when they bothered to ADD backdrops ) This was such a disappointment , I was too mad at it to rate it until this late hour . ( got it at 12 : 01 midnight last nite at WalMart ) This movie seriously hurt my feelings . I loved Lilo and Stitch . Just loved it . I was SO disappointed .

Painful To Watch	I'm in the minority on this , but I really disliked this film . I generally like to watch Harland Williams . Typically , he's a fine straight man , but sometimes , his dry wit shows through . In Rocketman , however , he has allowed himself to be reduced to sophomoric antics worthy of any SNL reject ( and I say that with all due respect ) and appears to belong in a Rob Schneider movie . Quite frankly , this was too painful to watch . The character wasn't funny . He was pathetically moronic . . . sad . . . not funny . This has been heralded as awesome , and hilarious , but neither is this funny , nor is it awe inspiring . It's just stupid , with no redeeming qualities whatsoever . I was not entertained , nor was I amused with this film . It rates a a from . . . the Fiend : .
Not part of the series ; not a good movie .	As with many other pop-culture franchise series , this line just didn't know when to quit . Instead of leaving things as they were perfectly ended , they went on to generate this ; the first installment of this franchise to fall sorely short of the mark . This movie should never have happened . It was not intended for there to have been a fourth movie in this line , and it sure shows . The premise is idiotic and the portrayals were the same . After the wonderful experience which was The Omen , this was a major disappointment which stank of 70's cheese and horrible acting . It was reminiscent of the Amityville Horror in those aspects , and left a terrible , lingering stench long after it was over . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
Trash	I hate to say it , but this was about as bad as Big Momma's House 2 . If the comparison isn't apt , then I'll have to say that it's worse . The blending of a contemporary moron with a medieval setting isn't fun , or clever , or even amusing . It was just plain awful . This tried to be the average man's A Knight's Tale , and fell flat on its face . In all honesty , the 4 . 0 rating this work currently enjoys here at IMDb is very generous . I don't know WHAT people were thinking to rate it that high , but there's honestly no accounting for taste . Do something else . Pull your own teeth with a fishing line and a heavy wooden door , rather than see this , it's just that bad . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
My Gods ! What a sck-fest !	Okay horror fans . The purists say to check out those dark obscure ponds rather than relying on mainstream to find the real " gems " of horror . Well if this is their idea of a gem , I'm not interested in fishing those dark obscure ponds anymore . This was worse than that Argento crap ! This was about the worst pile of putrid sludge to hit the industry since Killer Klowns from Outer Space . That's right boys and girls . KKfOS was BETTER than this .

I wanted to love it , but I can't even like it .	One of the main reasons this installment tanked is that it depends entirely on the second installment to bear it up . The problem with that is that the second installment was horrendous , so anything at all that depends upon it can not possibly be great . It could be better , but it can't be great . This isn't even better . I don't know if it's because the movie feels and runs like they spent a grand total of twelve minutes in development , or if each and every individual element is inferior ( if that's even possible ) to the second installment . Either way , it's not worth my time to figure it out , it's just that bad , but if you happened to be among the two or three people who liked the second installment , the third is necessary to fill in the numerous plot holes .

Completely Twisted and Disgusting	This is one of those films that makes me fear for the outcome of the human race , at large . I cannot see a reason for making a film such as this . It is the epitome of human exploitation , raping of the criminal justice system , and puts in question the humanity of society at large . The acting is superb , and the direction and execution of this film are beautiful , but the story itself is completely twisted and disgusting . Customarily , I like twisted , but this film is twisted in a totally wrong way . This film is not suitable for Friday / Saturday night viewing , as the subject matter is not appropriate for most movie goers . This film is not suitable for anyone with a tender heart . In fact , only the most desensitized of our numbers would even WANT to watch this . I know this will serve as a recommendation for some , but I found it completely repulsive and utterly devoid of humanity . It rates a 2 . 0 from . . . . . . the Fiend : .
Not Brilliant , Not Inspired , Not Creative , Just Nauseating	I would respect this show much more if they got rid of Mike Galanos . Mike Galanos is what's wrong with CNN and HLN with is alarmist reporting . He needs his prissy little sense of antiquated morality updated and upgraded with a strong dose of reality . Where was this guy raised ? In Victorian era England ? I rather doubt his views would have been accepted even then . This guy is a PRUDE with no apparent common sense whatsoever . His presence , just the sight of his face , ruins the show in my opinion , and remember legal department , this entire review IS OPINION . He says , " Let's hear what YOU think , " but he does not want to hear what we think , he wants other Metatrons who will espouse his opinions , embrace his views , and tell him how wonderful he is . Otherwise , he scoffs at the caller's viewpoints , challenges their opinions , and attempts to belittle his audience . . . you know . . . the people who actually WATCH his drivel ? Otherwise , this show is done in talk show style with a decent moral center . . . until Galanos's face looms onto the screen . Sorry folks . I have respect for CNN and what it does , but Galanos is entirely superficial and inflammatory . In my opinion , he has no business whatsoever pretending to have anything to do with the " news . " He is , at BEST , an editorialist and nothing better . He opines , he does NOT report . Because of that , when he DOES report , I cannot trust him . A journalist is only as good as his word , and to me his word is nothing but spew . Change the name of his segment , or SOMEthing . I hate it . It's not news . It's an hour long alarmist editorial .

Never underestimate the power of stupid people in large crowds .	That was the sentiment I experienced while waiting in line for this movie . It isn't clever or witty . There is nothing intelligent to be found within . It parodies practically every horror movie ever made , and those left out will undoubtedly be picked up with the subsequent sequels . I won't bother naming them , as it really doesn't matter . This was a fun , but inane endeavor . It entertains , but only on the most base level . I'm not surprised it wow-ed at the box office , as there are many herds of the mindless flocking about . I say mindless , as this does nothing to pique your imagination , creativity , or cognitive abilities . Now , I realize not all theatrical attempts can be an intellectual exercise . But this is intellectually in the negative . It was mildly amusing , but nothing more . This work exhibited the lowest form of juvenile humor and grossed some $200M in box offices around the world .

I Don't Understand the Point . . . MAJOR SPOILERS	This movie was WAY too heavy and sad for little children , and yet , there was little in the way of adult entertainment to be found here , so I don't " get " who their target audience . . . was ? Disney should have known better than to allow the dark storyline . The lead character is killed ? ! I'm sure most parents had NO idea their child ( ren ) would be subjected to a darkling storyline such as this . Don't get me wrong , the visuals were awesome , but they follow a horribly slow beginning that feels like sand in the bathing suit as you're drug along to the " fun parts , " but then you're kicked in the stomach just as you're enjoying yourself . As I said , I don't understand the point . It's really too gritty for children , and there's nothing there for adults other than the visuals . If Disney wanted to experiment with their animation , they could have done it in a different way . I'm not amused . But I WAS entertained . A bit . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
Too Much Fluff , Too Many Distractions , and Little Else .	Gary Oldman is about the most enjoyable thing associated with this work , but the performance of Jack Johnson . They are both quite wonderful in this film . The story was decent , but the execution of the story was convoluted . In spite of that , the main problem is casting . I mean . . . Heather Graham ? She's good for some things , but her presence in this production is NOT a plus . And Lacey Chabert ? Not only did she make the character aggravating , but her performance was horrid . I normally would not trash a child's performance , but like Courtland Mead in Stephen King's authorized version of The Shining , Lacey Chabert is whiny , superfluous , and inept . The effects of Spider / Smith are cheesy and obvious CGI . I don't mind even a heavy use of CGI , but it MUST be done with skill , or it destroys much of the work . But here , it barely even mattered . The casting , the story , and the execution were pretty awful . So what was good here ? Believe it or not , Matt LaBlanc . He was a surprising wild card who contributed something actually noticeable . . . in a good way . Gary Oldman did the best he could with the dismal elements surrounding him , and again , Jack Johnson stole the show . He was a sheer delight . The sappy ending will no doubt touch you , but it feels more like a molestation than the warm fuzzy hug it is intended to be . This was set up so that it could have been great , but in the end it is a total failure in the way of execution ; the insane casting choices , and pointless meandering story line killed it .

Seems to be folded . . . great movie making , but there isn't much for the average movie goer . . . at least if they care that there is no meat beneath the grafixtravaganza	While any connoisseur of film will undoubtedly enjoy this eye candy smÃ¶rgÃ¥sbord , the story telling ( while creative and fresh ) is lost amidst the vacant , spoon-fed , slack-jawed , no-brainery perpetrated upon the audience . The production style and camera work , digital effects , and . . . well , eye candy is something to be beheld , however , there is something missing in the overall quality of the combined elements of the work . I can't say what that something is at the moment , but if it occurs to me , I'll be sure to edit this " comment .

But as a fan of cinema on the whole , I cannot say that I subscribe to the actual worth of these techniques , much less their necessity in the business . Oh yes , sure , the performances were A-list and the screenplay was A-quality , but this film is not about those elements of the process , as much as it is about the process itself .

Disappointing , inferior sequel .	It had promise , but all you really see is what it could have been in comparison to what it was . This is far inferior to the original . But don't give up on the franchise yet ! The Third installment is much , much better . I have to say this was a serious let-down after the first . Freddy's Revenge just lacks too much in the way of story in comparison to the original . Jesse Walsh has moved into the Thompson house with his family , they find Nancy's old diary and it's just terribly predictable from that point on . There are a few cool effects and some decent one-liners , but this movie is so far beneath the original that I can't praise it very well here . It is not possible to miss the fact that Wes Craven neither wrote nor directed this little stinker . His trademark signature is absent , and so is his creativity . SPOILERS AHEAD ! This is the installment in which Freddy attempts possession of a victim , rather than the oblivious destruction of him . And through his possession , he attempts the cross-over between the Realm of Dreams and this one . It works for him , but unfortunately , not the movie . One of the major flaws with this chapter is in the prolific use of special effects which in no way begin to hide the obvious and notable lack of story , dialog and / or anything else of worth . To make it better would have been to explain things more ; any things . Oh , it's not that the movie was difficult to follow . A child could have followed THIS story line . It's more that the story had potential which , due to lack of care and nurturing , was left to die on the vine . Actually , a film inspector , David Chaskin , wrote this Nightmare , due to a lack of funding and access to more creative people , according to the Nightmare on Elm Street Encyclopedia . New Line was still a fledgling company and they had no resources . Wes Craven had nothing to do with this one , and indeed , passed on it because of the low quality of script and overuse of special effects . " I think the point of Nightmare 2 was let's get a film going quickly . " Rachael Talalay , Production Assistant . This is the second red flag for this movie . Aside from not having real talent to do the film , it was rushed into production without a female lead . Instead , they brought in a feminine male lead , causing this film to be billed as a homo-erotic horror , which did little to boost ticket sales in the US . Flaw # 3 is that they broke the mold Wes Craven established and they produced a vastly inferior finished product . They tried to drag Freddy out of the Realm of Dreams and into this reality , thereby taking Craven's Freddy Bible , if you will , and tossing it out the window . Even Robert Englund , the STAR of these movies , clearly states that the whole idea was ludicrous . Now , to its credit , without Craven , they still managed to hold onto the franchise . It wasn't totally obliterated with this installment , and indeed , if you're not a die-hard Freddy fan , you may still enjoy watching this one for its campier moments . The First NOES was relentlessly suspenseful . This second NOES was nothing more than a mediocre popcorn movie . I , however , am a Freddy fan , and still can't give it more than a and feel right about it . the Fiend : .
Candy-Coated Realism	Having survived the 1970's , the Disco Era , and the age of wanton drug use and unprotected sexual encounters , I must say that this was not as " true " or as " gritty " as the producers of this work would have you believe . Danny Bonaduce's childhood was far worse , David Cassidy's ability to handle the fame was much less , and Shirley Jones's love of those kids was vastly greater than portrayed here in this cotton candy version of the Partridge Family's behind-the-scenes episodic lives . While the individual components are touched upon , the exponential elements of this hit-and-miss attempt are more miss than hit ; not only because of the writing ( which was lame as all heck ) , but also because of the horribly flaccid performances by the child " talent " in this candy-coated reenactment . There was one exception : Shawn Pyfrom . He demonstrated more than a small amount of talent . All in all ? I found this lacked the realism to stand as an actual documentary , but rather came off as a lame , candy-coated , made for TV version of reality , and as such , it lessened the effectiveness it otherwise could have demonstrated .

Interesting But Superfluous and Unimaginative .	I realize I am in the minority here at IMDb ( on many occasions ) , but it behooves me to say that . . . While this film was adventurous and gritty , I had several problems with it . . . there is little chance Knightly's character would have been given the opportunity to demonstrate her fighting skills by all accounts , Merlin ( Merwyn , M . . . there are too many variations for me to list them ) was a force to be reckoned with when it comes to the Arthur of legend ( not to be confused with the Arthur of historical significance ) , he was the Constantine of his little corner of the world in that he had to decide whether or not his people , for all time , would be Christian or Pagan they left out every trace of Magick and ShamanismNow , I personally want a little magick in my myth , as that is the way they were written . What does it matter whether it is historically accurate to say that Mherline ( just another spelling of , " Merlin " ) was a Magick User of great global significance , or not ? ! Why tamper with the story so severely that it completely changes the very essence of that myth / legend ? Because it was NOT done with a loving care to the legend , this movie utterly fails to capture the imagination and lift the viewer out of the daily routine . I found myself going over the grocery list in my head during this movie ! Some have touted this work to be " historically accurate . " Feh ! There is not enough history to support ANY version of the King Arthur legend . We know he existed , but beyond that , there is not enough substantiating evidence to go one way or the other .

A bit better , but still missing the mark	Fans eagerly awaited the third chapter in the Leprechaun saga , hoping beyond hope that this would be the good one . Fans were disappointed .

Fun the first time , but not worth a second viewing .	Rick Moranis has done some interesting roles during the path of his career , and this was another of those , but unfortunately , it's one of those feel-good kid's movies that fail to make you feel good after the first viewing . It was fine at first , and actually entertaining , but once the story has played itself through to the end , there is really no need to watch it again . This is unusual for me to say , as I watch movies over and over , but for me , this one loses its charm after the initial viewing . Otherwise , the child stars were competent ; not talented , but competent , in their roles . This is not an example of talented child actors , beautiful sets , great story , etc . Basically , this is a modernized remake of the absent-minded professor , without Flubber , enigmatic characters , great writing , ingenious story , compelling dialog , or even benefit of talented thespians . The one great thing about this work was Rick Moranis , but you got too little of him and too much of the stiff , cardboard-cut-out kids . I was disappointed . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
Not as bad as the critics say .	The movie opens with a caravan of gypsies ( complete with campers , station wagons filled with belongings and small trailers ) driving into a small town . Your lead character Billy Halleck , played by Robert John Burke , is obviously wearing what the movie industry terms as a " fat-boy " or fat suit . The witticisms exchanged between the family members is shallow , hollow and plastic . There is no feel of " family " there at all . I won't detail the movie , scene by scene , but the courtroom scene which follows is convincing and believable , as is the " bonding " scene which comes after between Billy and the Italian " business man . " That's where the movie takes a turn for the worst . Again , if you do not read Stephen King's books , then these points won't bother you at all . There are way too many holes in the story . There are entire scenes from the book , omitted from the theatrical work . It has a definite " Hunchback of Notre Damme " feel to it in its " gypsies are evil , sexually promiscuous , caucasian-hating parasites " way of treating those of Romanian / Carpathian descent , as did the book , but it was the effects that kept me amazed . When things start to go wrong in the storyline , so do they go wrong in the effects department . Nothing looked as it should . As the lead character begins to lose weight , so does the script and the effects . His " fat suits " look better as he begins to return to his real weight , but then as he begins to grow " thinner , " the baaaaaad effects are back ; and with a vengeance . I won't even talk about the lizard-like judge . His effects were even worse . Good story , bad direction , horrible effects .

I like this , but cannot love it .	Okay , so this has been done and done , but quite delightfully done was this attempt . I did not , however , enjoy the fact that Cary Grant's character lies throughout this film . It was very off putting to see Cary Grant just boldly and clearly lying to his wives scene after scene . That having been said , getting past that off-putting element , the performances are witty and clever , delivering a natural human feeling , even when in tongue-in-cheek mode . The twists are eye brow-raising and cleverly written , incorporated in an otherwise enchanting story . All in all ? I wish they had written these characters more forthright .

Clark Wilhelm Grizwald ; the epitome of Murphy's Law .	The Grizwold Family Vacation just isn't going to be the same this year . If you know Clark , you know he never under-does anything . Clark is a spineless worm of a man who deary loves his family . He is a gullible idiot who lacks the backbone to stand up for himself , until he absolutely cracks . He takes and takes until he little mind just can't take it anymore and then he goes completely nuts . This , the first in a small series of " Vacation " movies , is the most successful endeavor . While the sequels are each enjoyable , they lack the care that went into the making of this first installment . There are quite a few moments which have you rolling your eyes and cringing inwardly , but the campy humor never ceases to entertain . Driving across the country with two children in the back seat is an arduous enough task without having Clark W . Grizwold at the helm . He is almost flagitious in his determination to have fun . On their way to " Wally World , " to see " Marty Moose , " anything that can go wrong , does . Stopping for obvious tourist attractions such as the " House of Mud , " surely does nothing to help this trip . And neither does the little blonde in the red sports car , who distracts Clark so badly that he can barely keep himself contained . Equal to the bad choices and horrible distractions , is their visit with Cousin Eddie ( Randy Quaid ) . From country losers who are obviously the white trash of the family , we get quotes like , " I'm going steady and I french kiss . " " So ? Everybody does that . " " Yeah , but Daddy says I'm the best at it . " and " Dad taught me something really neat last year . Ever bop your bologna ? " and " I don't know why they call this ' Hamburger Helper , ' it does just fine all by itself . " Don't eat sandwiches during the scene just after they leave Cousin Eddie's house . You'll regret it . Just a heads-up . Although I must admit that Clark's solution to Aunt Edna's horrid little mutt was rather creative .

This Is Actually Pretty Good	$30M US Budget , $12 . 5M US Worldwide Gross . Not good . Unless whomever took the chance on this film needed a tax write-off for the year , they may be regretting it , but I have to say I was surprised a bit by this one . There have been so many of this type of films released since the new millennium became a consideration , and after a time , they all start sounding , looking , and feeling alike . This one felt like Escape From New York meets Resident Evil with a little smattering of Mad Max thrown in here and there . That's not a bad mix , if you ask me , and Malcolm McDowell's involvement does not hurt one bit . So many here have detailed the story ad nauseum , so I won't do that , nor will I spoil the story . I will suffice it to say that I enjoyed this far more than I expected . The acting quality was a pleasant surprise . The villains were villainous without the usual restraint . The heroic moments were heroic without monologuing or speech giving . The dramatic moments were limited and without fluff . I liked it . It rates a 6 . 4 on the Movie Scale .

The Stepford Wives Remix .	This review contains spoilers for both this movie , and the original , " The Stepford Wives . " Even a horror comedy can have a cohesive story line . This story is more than convoluted . It's bastardized . It's completely lost . Don't get me wrong , I LOVE this movie . It's fun and it's funny , and there are some strong moments between Kidman and Broderick . Everyone put in good performances . But the direction was non-existent . I mean , come on . They didn't transplant the brains into robotic bodies . They simply couldn't make up their minds as to what they wanted to DO . So we ended up with a horrible mess . A fun mess , but still a mess . I totally believe that whole transplant device was invented after the fact and was never a part of the original storyline . I read the reviews and movie news and this movie was plagued with problems . Script problems , personality problems , emotional problems , set problems ; you name it . And it definitely shows . In the original movie ( don't know , don't care who saw it ) , the wives were murdered in pure cold blood , and replaced by robots . In the remake , they wanted a lighter theme than the cold-blooded murder of these women , so after filming the women like they were going to be robots , they began shooting them like they were altered , rather than replaced . In the remake , they wanted desperately for the women to be able to be " changed back , " to be given their minds again . They wanted to redeem the male species of these atrocities of the original work , and thereby , they ruined their whole effort . The story got more than lost between all the arguing between producers and staff , etc . and this hodge-podge is what we got stuck with . They cut the Bette Middler / lawnmower scene because they changed their story line half way through the movie and no longer wanted to portray her as THAT robotic , but more " altered " instead . It didn't work . Once they gave us a human ATM machine who was controlled with her own personal remote , it was too late to turn around and sell the audience on the whole watered-down chips-in-the-brain premise ( which was lame as all H3LL anyway ) , and expect us to buy it . So basically , they just said screw it , slapped it together and handed it to the fans . The movie made no sense because the movie was the first half of one movie , and the second half of a totally different movie . They should have sacrificed some of the low-brow humor for a more intelligent pass on this film , IMO . Had they had the cajones to actually " ring the bell " ( by killing off the wives as in the original ) with this attempt , the Bette Middler / Lawnmower scene could have been left in and this movie would have made a lot more fans happy . The one thing I did find refreshing was the inclusion of the first gay Stepford couple . It's about time Hollywood moved in to include everyone and not just the purely redneck , white bread , mainstream , over-christianized Americans . Nice touch . Too bad the rest of the movie wasn't as progressive . Although I highly recommend watching the original over this one , it's still a fun endeavor , however , and rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
Born of a hundred maniacs . . .	Well , at least this one kept the lead from the last , and the boyfriend . Good start . Unfortunately , Lisa Wilcox's performances are mediocre at best . The story had promise . . . and then along came Skipp . I don't know . It seems to me that no matter how they disguise the story , the back story and the plot twists , there is no way everyone sitting in that theater , in front of their TV or what have you , doesn't know that everyone but the lead will die . However the MO has been to let the lead return in the next sequel and THEN kill them off ! Is it possible that Freddy's losing his grip on the psyche of the young ? I will say the Gothic architecture of the Dream Realm leading into the monastery was excellent , but that was all CGI , and had nothing really to do with the story . This story line does become a bit clearer after a while , but it's after a long while of slow muddled progress to nowhere . This story did have promise . The effects would have been good ones , but I think they tried a little too hard to make up for the fact that the screenplay was so poorly written . What was so bad about it ? Well , they obviously did not feel the need to utilize their star , Robert Englund , or perhaps he was earning too much money this time around for them to use him in more than the very few scenes in which he was featured . Whichever the case , this was a serious let down . The effects were a bit better here , but it was the prolific use of CGI rather than the excellent make up effects of those before it , and effects do not mask a flaccid performance like that of Wilcox . It also does not correct the weak script . This was an attempt to make Freddy more mainstream , and in my opinion , that was the last thing this franchise needed . This isn't the death of the franchise , but it's far from a revival . I can't give it more than a , and that's a generous rating from . . . the Fiend : .
Dated but darkly delightful	Cat's Eye is filmed in the same style as " Creepshow " in that it has obvious chapters . But unlike " Creepshow , " they are related . This is a rather good work . The work is severely dated , but the stories are still as darkly twisted , malevolent , and amazing as they were when this was made . I won't detail the plots of these stories , save to say the last is my favorite . The " General " story has been paid homage to in SO many other horrors , and it's nice to touch base with the original inspiration from time to time . This was filmed in 1984 and released in 1985 , so that would put Drew Barrymore at about 9 years old when this was done . This was filmed approximately 3 years after E . T . and one year after Firestarter . She was much better in those works , but 9 is an awkward age for girls , so we'll forgive the slip , as she was not bad in this , just not as good as the aforementioned attempts .

Witty AND Clever	Although it is aged around the edges , History of the World is one of my favorite comedies . Admittedly , I have a good 100 in my " favorites " list , but HotW is definitely in the top 25 . It is pure enjoyment and while sometimes raucous , it is never raunchy . Tactless , but never dumbed down , and that makes for the best kind of comedy . In true Brooks fashion , this work takes you from a parody of life to a satirical pop-culture vehicle . Unfortunately , the many late 1970's pop-culture references throughout the dialog is what dates this work . Otherwise , it would still be fresh , today . Led by Mel Brooks's polished stylized direction , this work is not only hilarious , but is clever in its irony . It never takes itself too seriously , and delivers with every scene . If you liked Wholly Moses , you will LOVE this ! It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
Funny For A While	This is one of those films you can watch , and actually laugh at for a time or two , but after that , it's just not funny anymore . For a first viewing , this flick will deliver some genuine belly laughs , although you will feel your intelligence slip , as you enjoy it . Watch this one only for the chuckles . If you watch it for any other reason , you're watching the wrong movie . One of Carrey's better performances . His earlier works are far better , comedically , than are his later works . I like the genre change he seems to be experimenting with of late , and I hope it does something to rejuvenate the quality of his performances . Either way , this is quite entertaining , if only for a few run-throughs . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
This was much better than the first .	There was more action , more revelations ( pun intended ) , more story . It is still nothing more than a two hour sermon , but at least this one was a bit more entertaining . Damien is now old enough to attend to his own affairs and after he is shown who and what he is , he takes them well in hand . Now living with his uncle and his family , Damien is somewhat eager for things to proceed in the usual , chaotic fashion . There's not really much to say about this installment except that if you are going to watch the franchise , this is a must see in order to understand the progression of events . The nicest element was the use of ravens . Very nicely done . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
By far , the BEST Austin Powers Movie ! !	When I first saw the reviews of this movie , the trailers and the previews in the theater , I thought , " Oh wow , has Austin Powers lost its edge . " But I was misled by the " teaser " trailers . I did not , as a result , see this movie in the theater , but instead waited for it to come out on video . My loss . This is by FAR , the best Austin Powers movie yet . This is supposed to be the last installment , the concluding chapter of the trilogy , as it were , but I hope that is not the case . Beonce was wonderful as Foxy . She's no Heather Graham , but that could be a good thing .

Chucky's back .	Well , the possessed doll is back , and this time , he's got a new face and it's much better animated . This installment has a little bit better feel to it than the first . Perhaps it's because we , as an audience , are more comfortable with the concept of a killer doll with foul language , and a little boy who is a gutsy unwilling victim . Also , while the first one was campy , the second has some seriously funny moments . However , the camp is still quite prevalent . But , as the human soul is indestructible , so is Chucky . It's the soul of Charles Lee Ray , which animates him , after all , and until they figure out how to destroy a soul , we're going to be " blessed " with Chucky movies . from . . . the Fiend : .
A guilty pleasure	This movie was replete with anachronisms , contrivances , and cheese , but was ultimately a - lot - of fun to watch . There are too many of the elements listed above to begin to list them , but I will start with the " minis . " The over-weight bad guy , rat burgers , the government determining anything " bad for you " is illegal , the AfricanAmerican as the violent bad guy , and 60-second segways of 1970's and 1980's television and radio commercial jingles chopped and played on the air waves as forms of " art , " was all just too much . Stallone played this part as a serious part with a wry humor . He is almost as wry as Norm Macdonald without sounding stupid . Sandra Bullock played her part as a purely serious part . Very well done . Everything and everyone else in and about this movie was contrived cheese which was out of its time . As I said . It IS fun to watch , but only in small doses . I won't even bother detailing the plot . Once you realize what you've walked into , the plot almost won't matter , anyway . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
Sweet , Intelligent , and Endearing Family Fun	Well , between elves with attitude and a job offer he can't refuse , Scott seems to be suffering a little identity crisis . Let's face it , he's a bit uncomfortable within his own skin , and nothing he can do will alleviate his discomfort . This is great fun , a bit dramatic , but exhibits that beautiful Spirit of Yule many of us experience once the weather turns frosty and the fireplaces are lit . Suitable for all ages , this is a new tradition for holiday viewing once the Yule tree is lit the weekend after Thanksgiving , along with Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and the Boris Karloff version of How The Grinch Stole Christmas . All in all ? We thoroughly enjoyed it and highly recommend it for anyone who loves the season of Yule . This rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
This Is NOT As Bad As Critics Say !	As usual , I find myself on the opposing side of the critics . This movie has NO BUSINESS in the bottom 100 here at IMDb ! It's FAR from a masterpiece , but it's also just as far from deserving that low a rating . As is often the case , whenever you have a good monster / creature feature , lurking somewhere in the shadows is a mad scientist . Such is the case in this film . In fact , I found the mad scientist a tad too mad . I think that is the main contributor to the low ratings this movie receives here at IMDb . The " doctor's " performance went WAY over the top . Well , he's supposed to be insane , but he plays it like pure camp , and that's horribly out of place in this otherwise serious work concerning a lab experiment gone awry . . . or has it ? The animated / CGI bats are well done , and all performances besides the doctor are enjoyable and on target . Unfortunately , he was bad enough to have brought down the whole film . This is fun , generates some good suspense , and isn't afraid to show you the nemesis . The story itself is quite competent to hold up , and does , IF you can ignore the wretched performance given by Bob Gunton . I must say that I do not believe it to be wholly his fault , as he has given some great performances in the past , and since . The fault must lie with the director , Louis Morneau , who has never done much of note . I like this film and can enjoy it , in spite of the doctor , and do find myself watching it from time to time . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
Edge of Your Seat Action , But A Suspense Overload	This film features a decent story , generates great suspense , and exhibits an ability to combine action with levity in a well proportioned delivery , but the suspense it generates is so intense and goes on for so long that you practically become bored with the premise . It pushes the envelope in generating appropriate suspense , but it pushes it too far , as it takes itself far too seriously , while trying to mix levity into the picture . While it does so rather well , there are moments of inconsistency wherein the suspense overplays its hand and fails to deliver a payoff , and the levity has you laughing , but sometimes in the wrong places . Aside from that , the action was great and the cast contributed professional performances . Dialog delivery is phenomenal , maintaining the timing , even when the surrounding elements are out of step . This was entertaining , and a sure hit with the Friday Night Is Guy's Night crowd .

This is a highly under-rated and ill-appreciated freaky little thriller .	Okay , before I start , I will be the first to admit that there are a couple of plot holes , an unforgivable contrivance , and that belief does have to be suspended here and there for Jessie the wonder-kid's feats . Okay . There . I've said it . All in all , this film is a wonderfully entertaining darkling freak of a movie . This is not your typical slasher / serial killer fare . I found this attempt to be downright disturbing and unsettling . This remains one of my favorites for the socially responsible message , the beautiful relationship between Glenn's character and that of his son , and the wonderful element of suspense found here . Great low budget thriller with a solid , fluid story and some decent performances by Scot Glenn and Jesse Cameron-Glickenhaus . Definitely worth a watch . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
Enjoyable But Distracted	This was the first time I really paid attention to Angelina Jolie and her performance . Don't get me wrong , I enjoyed her in Girl , Interrupted as much as possible considering the subject matter , and I really liked her character in the Bone Collector , but I never paid her much attention . She was just the latest bit of fluff to sit on Billy Bob Thornton's lap , and nothing much more . Cage contributes an adequate performance herein , but I have to say Jolie's work tops his in quality , this time around . Cage appears distracted , unable to concentrate , and maintain a viable believable emotional state , be it edge , excitement or grief . I'm more than a casual Cage fan , so I find this a difficult review . The story is a great story if you are a fan of actioners , and the direction was adequate , what brought this down , really , is a deteriorating state of social conscience ( as reflected in this script ) and Cage's seeming inability to hold a coherent dialog in his head . Otherwise , this is quite enjoyable and rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
All In All , This Was Heartwarming , If Only Mildly So .	Let me start off by saying I like this movie , and I own it . But to break it down , I like it more because it features Mel Brooks's voice than any other reason . The work itself is enjoyable , does teach a moral lesson , and entertains via Robin Williams , but Robin was only the comedic relief , and Mel Brooks's character was nothing but a strong supporting character . The moral lesson is to follow your dream ; a lesson I like to see going out to our children . It is an often used message , but I still don't think they hear it enough . The star voice belongs to Michael J . Fox , who seemed to be the only one besides Brooks to get into their characters and really give them some sense of life . Otherwise , the voices are a bit lackluster , probably due to the lack of real material into which they could actually sink their teeth ( or emotional investment ) . However , the finished product is still enjoyable . All in all , this was heartwarming , if only mildly so , and is still worth the time to view it . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
A Great Adventure !	Jackie Chan has finally made it to the genre of James Bond quality movies ! Congratulations , Jackie ! This film was MORE than worth the price of the ticket . The direction was quality as were the performances of Chan and Hewitt . The storyline was interesting and twisty , if a bit predictable complete with classic spy-type innovations . The idea of the Tuxedo itself was creatively cute and quirky . I love it ! However . The talents of Mr . Chan as a martial artist were not as prevalent in this film as in his past ones . I felt he should have put a LOT more of himself into this movie in terms of action sequences . I've become accustomed to Jackie's great presence in his films and was a little disappointed with his lack thereof . But that in no way takes away from the quality of this film . I merely mean that more of his martial artist skills would have made it top row . It gets a from . . . the Fiend .
One of Sci-Fi's Best Epics	Reviewing this is , for me , like reviewing the original Star Wars . Where does one begin ? A compilation of ingeniously created worlds , endearing characters , superb creativity , and a most intriguing story , Dune is the epitome of classic sci-fi . The darkling twists , the intrigue , the plots and sub-plots , all come together to deliver a rousing saga of treachery , nobility , and redemption . This is probably one of the best science fiction works out there , and as far as I'm concerned , is one of the very best . The Director's Cut ( or Extended Edition , whatever ) contains all the pre-story material a Dune fan could dream of . This is a classic , and is a definite must see by any budding sci-fi fan , although it lacks lightyears from the Herbert source materials . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
Great Father / Son Movie , but Not Much Else .	As the Summary indicates , this work is a fantastic bonding work for fathers and sons , and some may find it uplifting or inspiring . For those people , I'm glad . I found it more or less depressingly disquieting . It left me , and those with me , wondering what was the point of the movie ? The point , I'm sure , was to tell the story of the lead character . However , I didn't find it uplifting , inspiring , or entertaining . I felt like I'd wasted my time and money .

Under-rated Made4TV fare .	The things which were right included the wonderful performance by John Rhys-Davies , the inclusion of the jester-dressed martial arts dragon slayer , wonderful vistas and views , wonderful ( if not excellent ) " alien " dragons , and great dialog . The problems with it included the horrible delivery of said great dialog ; the casting was extremely uneven which made for low charisma between thecharacters and the timing of the whole production was a bit off . The armor and costuming were too new and stole from the finished product the opportunity to lend some air of authenticity to the era . The crown worn by Wednesbury wasobviously modern designed , manufactured and the jewels were of obviousplastic and appeared to have been molded onto the " paper / foil " crown . It was sickening . The structures and sets suffered the same anachronistic sickness as did the costumes and props . Also , the dragon in the beginning could have received a much better treatment . I know people who do graphics for themselves , for their own home-run website , who do better graphics than the CGI we were presented in the beginning of this flick . When you slow it down and watch it frame by frame , they lack definition and character as they do when just watching it normally . Half way through the movie , however , these dragons take on a whole new dimension and are given the treatment they deserved . This went a long way into redeeming this film , although the chunky direction and badly timed delivery still manages to drag down what ( when given proper attention ) is a really well written , creative , and " A " movie worthy screenplay / teleplay . Someone should actually do this for the Big screen , using the same script . This could have been SO much more than this crappy little television movie . How sad that they couldn't have acquired better talent to portray this work . It's a real shame to have to repeat the dialog to yourself in your mind to get the inflections and wit behind it . And the voices ? Were those dubbed or what ? They didn't seem to match up to the moving lips . It was like watching a bad 1970's Kung Fu Theater feature . Of course , that came and went as the movie progressed . The score was actually quite good and many times was the only things carrying the movie through the horrible dry deliveries and really bad acting . Alas ! It wasn't enough . But let's work with what we do have . We have " The Lament . " John , oh JOHN ! What are you DOING ? Jackson cast actors who needed a big break or a fresh start , and as soon as LotR is over , THIS is what you go back to ? ! You're wasting yourself and your talents on crap like this ! We have " The Jester-Dressed Far Eastern Dragon Slayer . " He chops . He kicks ; he gives you true Chinese philosophical wisdoms , and all the while , he never gets a wrinkle in his acetate jester shirt . Not even when wearing his hard leather armor at the dinner table . We have " Lil Miss You Could Have Knocked " who rubs herself over the heated water barrel and hides her already hidden breasts instead of her nether-regions which AREN'T covered . Way to be coy and discreet , girl . 4 Real . I mean , she's leaning into that barrel , giving it a look that definitely says , " I hate these medieval movies ! Where is the SPIN cycle on this thing ? ! " We have " Mr . I've Never Heard of a Hairbrush or a BONE to Brush My Hair " Huntsman who looks as if he is wearing a very bad wig , and if he's not , he should watch out for that family of spiders who have obviously nested in his hair . And we have some good-looking dragon's fire , dragon sequences and after the first few minutes ' hesitation , dragons that they weren't afraid to let you see in nice , stunning detail . Kudos to the effects people ( those who gave you Python ) for the stunning work . Why all this for some Made For TV ( which means " Not Fit For The Big Screen " ) Crap-Fest ? Because of what it COULD have been . This screen play and the dialog found therein , is witty and wonderful . It was just very poorly demonstrated by the severe lack of talent in the direction and in the portrayals . It rates a on the " B " scale from . . . the Fiend : .
Fun and Sweet , but Generally Common	I can't say I love or hate this film . Between Humphrey Bogart ( African Queen ) and John Wayne's previous films ( Hatari ! l , et al ) , this story has been done and done . The backdrop and the characters change , but the basic story seems prevalent throughout a series of these films . STORY : Bothersome female tags along against the willful would-be alpha male's will , and love ensues . / STORY Sometimes , it's an ambiguous love with no specified intent . At other times , it's a direct love , with serious intentions for the matrimonial altar . Either way , love ensues . I can't say that I hate these old lovelies , as they are pure entertainment , and hold a sense of what it was like in a more innocent age ( the age of my mother and her friends ) , back when Hollywood still had the ability to make us believe in the innate sweetness that accompanies innocence . Portrayed herein is a level of naivetÃ© at which most would scoff , and some would exploit , today . Even if you're not a fan of the Duke , watch this for Hepburn's awesome irascible performance .

Romero Romances YouTube Generation	I'm going to start this review by saying point blank and period that I liked this . It lacked a certain finesse , but had its own style and form . It felt more like Romero went back to the original Night of the Living Dead , and attempted ( successfully in my humble opinion ) to capture the suspense of that brilliance . He may not have completely succeeded , but the suspense is tangible , nonetheless . The acting has been hit pretty hard in other reviews , but aside from the usual stereotyping to which this type of film almost always subscribes , the performances were pretty believable . . . IF one can suspend belief long enough to enjoy a feature length film , that is . As far as zombie films go , this wasn't bad . It was entertaining , visceral , and made me squeal ( yes , the Fiend squealed ) at least twice , to my chagrin . There are a few " scare you " moments , and a lot of " things jumping out at you " moments , with some " gotcha ! " s and a couple of red herrings . As far as Romero goes , this was bread and butter . It rates a on the movie scale . It registers a on the Romero scale . It rates an on the splatter scale from . . . the Fiend : .
Highly Interesting Courtroom / Mob Biopic	Vin Diesel . When an ambitious prosecutor drags him back into court , imprisoned mobster Jack DiNoscio decides to defend himself instead of ratting on his associates in a New Jersey crime family . Vin Diesel is an unlikely casting choice in this film , but his casting really pays off . His performance is phenomenal ! I say that wish such surprise , as I am typically not a great fan of his work , although I did enjoy the Riddick works . This plot is a bit twisted , creating some intrigues one might not expect , while the story flows well , without breaks and bumps in the line . The believability is a bit in jeopardy , but overall , this is amusingly witty , and quite entertaining .

Fun comedic action sequel	I thoroughly enjoyed this movie ! The direction was par excellence , the acting and sets , the story and props . . . everything was wonderful , exciting and exhilarating executed . You get to see Jackie , as only he can , pick up just any old thing and kick someone's butt with it . His choreography of these scenes was ( as always ) most excellent . While this installment was a bit subpar to the original , it was not the failure nor the flop other reviewers would have you think . It is great fun to see Chan and Wilson together again , this time in England . They are on an utmost mission : to save Chan's sister , who is attempting to locate their father's murderer , on her own . Having a penchant for attracting trouble , much like her brother in that aspect , of course she is the damsel in distress by the time they find her , but she soon shows she IS his sister , but demonstrating some very good foot and hand work .

Better ? Not Quite , But Still Enjoyable .	Episode II is rated by other critics as superior to Episode I , but frankly I feel it is rather over-rated , as this is not quite the masterpiece for which I had hoped , upon reading those reviews . They've touted it as , " . . . a return to the old formula . . . " for which the Star Wars Money Machine is known . That seems rather ignorant to me , as this is the second prequel installment , so of course more familiar elements will be demonstrated here than were in the first , as there will be even more in Episode III . That is a given . For them to proclaim that this is somehow superior to the Introduction that was Episode I because of those more familiar elements , is just asinine . Episode I , as an introduction , was perfectly presented . This work , however , was more focused on Luca$'s obsession with teen love and an homagic tribute to his " America Graffiti , " than any attempt at the actual meat of the Star Wars Saga . While there was lots of action and some brilliant effects , this chapter of the Star Wars saga ran more like your typical teenage angst-filled romance , than what I would expect from the Luca$ Star Wars money machine . Episode II is a literal sea of cameos by other well-known to fairly-known actors . Everyone wanted in on these movies - Check out Marton Csokas as Geonosian Archduke Poggle the Lesser ( uncredited ) . You may remember him from Lord of the Rings trilogy as Celeborn ! ! . As most of you now know , the star is Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker . Now , I've nothing against the lad , but Hayden Christensen ? ! The Star Wars money machine is a far cry from playing the Paper Boy in John Carpenter's " In the Mouth of Madness , " and it shows . He plays the part unprofessionally . I was not impressed with this young man's talents in the least . His portrayal is stiff , as though he's been taped to a long pole which has been run up his back . He delivers his dialog as though he were reading cue cards while merely parroting the words . Anakin is full of the usual teenage angst ; rebellion , outbursts of pious whining , given to fits of sulky anger and more whining . But his execution of this performance never quite rings the bell . He appears angry , but doesn't quite demonstrate it . He appears full of pain , but is not quite convincing . The story helps to convince , but Christensen falls short each and every time . Scene by scene , his actions are designed to demonstrate his leaning towards the dark side , but he's too normal a teen aged boy for this tool to be the least bit effective . He does not demonstrate the appropriate darkness necessary for him to pull it off the role of a would-be Vader . His unimpressive performance makes it completely unbelievable that he will ever BE Darth Vader . He's too . . . " average . " Some critics have declared that his murder of the entire village of sand people who captured and subsequently killed his mother , to be a sure indication that he is headed down the wrong path , but I daresay that were that any of OUR mothers , we might have behaved in much the same way without ever being classified at the level of evil one expects from he who will be Darth Vader . I guess this is just another one of those " wait and see " judgments I will have to make after the release of Episode III . Don't get me wrong ; you get a great movie . This work is filled with exhilarating battles , good story development ( as long as you don't think about it ) , great visual effects , and otherwise stellar performances . It's just replete with plot holes , Christensen stinking up the screen , and devotes more time to PadmÃ© and Anakin than it does the saga , itself . Featured within are several great battles , including a rousing battle between Yoda and Dooku . It was rather endearing watching Yoda jump around in that battle like a little spider monkey on crack . It looked impossible that he didn't cut himself clean in half . I kept expecting to see his two , separate pieces fall individually ; green blood spraying the Count . The story which takes a back seat , but is evident , surrounds the Clone Wars . A long-deceased Jedi Master has ordered an enormous clone army to be constructed on behalf of the Republic . The " cloners " have secured the DNA of the very capable bounty hunter Jango Fett and have used his DNA to build the army . You later get to see Yoda take command of this army , though in a small way , to rescue the captured Jedi Knights and Masters from the clutches of evil . There is also a large sweeping epic story line which is somehow lost in what becomes nothing more than a trumped-up teen love story . For some reason , Luca$ seems unable to stay on the main plot , and keeps going back to PadmÃ© and Anakin . We all know they both violated their vows and positions . We all know they are Luke and Leia's biological parents . We didn't need for half the screen time to go to their angst-filled teenage love story . This single factor , excluding all the questions and plot holes and / or continuity problems , weighed this movie down so far from The Phantom Menace , that I can scarcely work up any enthusiasm for Episode III . What enthusiasm I do have is surrounding the possibility of Luca$ actually filling in some of these gaping holes , seeing Wookies in battle , and uplifting the prequel trilogy back up to the level where we , as Star Wars fans , need it to be . I suppose something like a is fair , but that will change after we see how well it introduces and sets up the story contained in Episode III , just as Episode III's rating will be determined with how well it was allowed to tie into Episode IV , so hopes are not high . the Fiend : .
A sly and atmospherically powerful who-dun-it .	Agnes Moorhead ( Endora of " Bewitched " fame ) is a sheer delight as a cagey old bird of a mystery writer , and Price is wonderful in his seemingly dual role . As has been lamented here before , the brevity of Price's screen time is somewhat disappointing but that is the only factor which disappoints . I found this to be an inventive and disingenuous endeavor full of red-herrings and wrong turns . Figure this one out for yourself . Puzzle the clues , weed out the characters set here as distractions , look past the deliberate contrivances and solve the mystery on your own .

Another Spielberg Classic	While the movie's pages are dogeared and frayed , and there is a sure sign of wear about the edges , this film still maintains the ability to satisfy . Released the same year as Star Wars 1 ( later to be known as Star Wars 4 ) , Close Encounters had its work cut out for it in competition for the box office buck . The result in this skirmish was Star Wars = $11M budget / $798M Worldwide , and Close Encounters = $20M / $300M Worldwide . Not a bad return for either production , if you ask me , but Star Wars is the clear winner . Why ? Well , first off , there was the over-Christianized element of a priest ( Why was he even IN this movie ? ! ) telling everyone the aliens were " angels , " and then , as the aliens begin emerging out of their ship , some stupid woman begins PRAYING to them , on her knees ! That's always upset me . Are humans really this ignorant ? Of course , this isn't Spielberg's fault . These were the days of Eric von Dankien's wildly popular book , " Chariots of the Gods , " and it must have been considered " trendy " to chuck this kind of smarm into the movie , but it lessened its worth greatly , in my estimations . And secondly because Close Encounters failed to capture the imagination as firmly as Star Wars did . Star Wars surrendered effects such as would make you believe you were watching something real , where CE dwelled more on the human psyche rather than the effects . It would have done three times as well , had it not had the fierce competition of SW . While it was a wonderful movie then , and is still a wonderful movie now , I'd say it's time for a ( definite ) make-over for this old girl . She still rates an from . . . the Fiend : .
More clever than the Butterfly Effect	First , I want to know how a Drew Barrymore movie got past me . This is a very deep , intellectual demonstration of the inner workings of the human mind and imagination . This is a very good rendition of what happens to the gifted young who are not taught to keep their light hidden from the ' straights . ' From time to time , one like Donnie Darko emerges from the primordial cesspool that is our genetic makeup ; one who can see , hear and know of when's and where's which are not this reality . Children like him are invariably medicated and caged . . . or worse . While this is not the only movie to speak of children of this kind ( Powder , Warlock 2 , Firestarter , The Sixth Sense , and yes , even Harry Potter on some level ) , this has to be one of the most creative twists to this vein I've ever seen . This story is simply astounding . This movie shows the human condition within our society . Why people sometimes make the really bad choices . How sometimes that " thing " in your head doesn't go off and scream " BAD FREAKING IDEA ! " Why suicide sometimes occurs . Why sometimes a person would stop fighting for a better life and just . . . surrender to the one that is . It also shows that by going back to undo the bad things in our lives , we will also undo the good , leave those who loved us feeling empty and alone , and somehow miss out on this reality and hopes of something better in the face of insurmountable odds . I won't spoil this by telling the end . But wow . . . if this does not leave you feeling " disturbed , " nothing will . This is every bit as quirky and darkly startling as " May .

Some critics have given this movie low marks due to the " Pinhead in Space " factor , claiming that it was unnecessary and that it lent nothing but cheese to the story . Others have labeled the vehicle as a " franchise contrivance . " I must say that I agree with neither statement . Space was the ideal place for this sequence to have occurred . The plot would have suffered greatly had they tried this particular ideology on the Earth's surface . Also , this was a hard movie to make and I found nothing whatsoever contrived about it . It flowed smoothly and told the story beautifully ; albeit darkly . This movie also faced some real editing problems while in production . It seems the director had his name removed from this movie ( or changed ) after scenes depicting a deeper story line and stronger ideologies , were deleted . I give this wonderful installment high marks ! Rarely do the sequels even begin to measure up to the original , much less surpass it . It rates an from . . . the Fiend : .

Superb comedy ! Bill Murray's best .	This is a beautiful , quirky , bittersweet comedic venture , directed by Frank Oz and starring Richard Dreyfus as the anal retentive , controlling but successful psychiatrist and Bill Murray as the " almost paralyzed multi-phobic personality with a strong need for family connections . " I prefer Murray as the comedian . As the straight-guy , I can't seem to buy into his performances . Bob Wiley ( Bill Murray ) has problems . Life in general is almost impossible and social interaction is all but impractical for him . He fears . . . everything . A divorced basket case who claims his wife left him for Neil Diamond , he has no prospects for work , love , friendships , or any of the human comfort we all need . . . except the attention of his diverse assortment and long string of psychiatrists . Dr . Leo Marvin ( Dreyfus ) is the unlucky psychiatrist who is next in line in the treatment of Bob's many severe phobias . But just as Bob begins to reach out , he discovers that his new " friend " is going on vacation . In a fit of depression and mania , he tricks Dr . Marvin's answering service into giving the location of his whereabouts and shows up in the center of town , screaming desperately for Dr . Marvin . Dr . Marvin arranges to contact Bob at the restaurant in town under the agreement that Bob will return to the city . The Marvin family is surprised by Bob's knock at the door , and they immediately fall in love with his quirky , lovable character . Dr . Marvin , who is none too happy about this development , starts driving a wedge between Bob and his family . Unfortunately for Leo , the family fails to understand his concern and dotes on Bob , creating an even stronger bond than the one Bob has already developed in his mind . In a last-ditch effort to rid himself of Bob for good , ( and because Leo feels betrayed by his family in favor of a mental patient ) Leo betrays Bob's trust in an attempt to have him committed . By this time , Leo is a definite candidate for Dr . Buddy Rydell's unorthodox intervention . ( See " Anger Management " for the low-down on Dr . Buddy Rydell . ) This effort backfires and the results are hilarious and snow-balls down hill for Leo from there . The wonderful , classic Bill Murray style colors this gently jaded comedic endeavor . I thoroughly enjoyed this work . Some have said that it mocks those experiencing mental problems , but if anything , it endears them to our hearts . Watch the movie and you , too , will love Bob . It gets an from . . . the Fiend : .
Coming of Age in the 1980's	Filmed as a retrospective , this production entertains , while also teaching its audience the lessons of friendship , manhood , love , family , parenting , money management , and how to win when the chips are down . Okay , that may be a weighty summation of this light-hearted love-fest devoted to KISS , but it is also apt , if heavy-handed . The quest can be substituted by anything other than KISS tickets , and the meaning and message are still there . Otherwise , if you're not into learning anything from your entertainment , it is still entertaining . I found it quite endearing , in fact . Proof you don't have to be a teenage boy to appreciate it . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
Spin on myth brings sheer delight	This is only the second dragon to have been realistically put on the big screen , during my lifetime and by my memory . The first was the Dragon World dragon . Even with the star-studded cast , the Dragon was the star ( and rightfully so , it's not called " Insert - Actor's - Name - Here - Heart " ) . This story , which has been gone over ad nauseum , will be skipped in detail . I will suffice it to say that the story , while dark and a bit plodding , is also creatively twisted . Professional performances and fantastic creativity bolster this attempt through the ( very few ) slow spots , and Sean Connery's voice as " Draco " was priceless . The effects were above average , and the overall execution was excellent . If you're a fan of the old Celtic Dragon Clans lore , or Celtic mythology , you may find a few hidden " treasures " within . We did . ; ) It rates an from . . . the Fiend : .
I know I'm in the Minority When I Say That . . .	I found this film much more fun and fulfilling than the first because of the addition of Jon Lovitz to the base cast . I realize this goes against common opinion , but I believe this installment was much better executed . The first movie , when compared to this sequel , feels like the main characters had something to prove to one another and not just to themselves where this chapter feels more self-motivated and " real , " primarily to the addition of Jon LovitzOne thing is for sure , without the City Slickers ' version of the Criterion Brothers as ranch hands , it was definitely more enjoyable for me . The " danger " sequences were slim and short while maintaining a tall adventure . Instead of using the first third of the movie to develop all the characters , they catch you up on Phil and Mitch and then lovingly introduce you to Glen . It left more time for the actual movie and less time for the " you must grow up to be a warrior " speeches and diatribes . I loved it ! Jon Lovitz is awesome ! It rates an from . . . the Fiend : .
Absolutely hilarious .	This movie is great fun . Especially when viewed within a gathering of 20-something's . Just sit back and watch'em squirm ! The narrator has a dead-pan voice which actually makes this mocumentary all the more amusing . The sequences of sperm running full tilt and SPLAT ! - ting into the wall are hilarious ! While this is not necessarily just for mature audiences , the extraterrestrial anthropologist gives you an outside peep into the human dating scene . So use your own discretion . This attempt is wonderfully entertaining , and delivers a witty , wry sense of humor in higher than MST3K style . We completely enjoyed this production , and watch it often .

Based on Actual Events . . . Yet Still Fun	I own this mainly because of Jeff Goldblum , so I wasn't expecting much in the way of real entertainment , but was more or less watching this for Mr . Goldblum's performance . I think he's one of the best actors in the business . I did not discover until after the fact that this film was based on actual events , and I had to go watch it again . Aside from beautiful performances by all three principals , the story itself has a wonderful flow , which works brilliantly with the material and weaves a highly enjoyable experience . This is an entertaining experience , but it also shows how desperate the Russians were to do something better for themselves , in spite of communist influences still in place . It also allows us a small peek into the corrupt offices of our own politicians . . . we already know they will do anything to get elected . This just proves those suspicions and marks them as " well known " and " public knowledge . " On a side note , I found this information here at IMDb and paraphrased it for those of you who are interested . " While the film portrays all three of the men in Russia during the whole campaign , our three consultants ( Gorton-Goldlum , Dresner-LaPaglia , and Shumate-Shreiber ) were in truth flying in and out over those five months , or so . They left one person in the US as a security precaution to ensure that the other two could leave when desired , and one younger member was left in Russia the whole time . Oddly enough , he was omitted from the movie . It was his notes they used to draft a screenplay , by the way . The hotel portrayed in the movie was the " President Hotel , " known as the " Oktiabraskaya " during Soviet Times . Each room in this hotel was equipped with gas masks , and the hotel compound was rumored to be secretly linked to the Moscow metro system for occupants to escape or guards and extra security to arrive . After the Yeltsin campaign , Gorton went on to be Arnold Schwarzenegger's political consultant , running Arnold's first campaign . The furniture-stacking scene is something that really happened , and happened more than once . The consultants ' paranoia is well founded . During the 1996 election cycle in Russia , the campaign manager for the mayor of St . Petersburg had acid thrown in his face , and the running mate for the mayor of Moscow was critically injured in a car bomb . " As I said , those words were paraphrased , but they may allow you a little behind the scenes knowledge as to the origins of this movie . Insider info like that tends to help me embrace the work more . Hope it does the same for you . All in all ? It's not Friday / Saturday night viewing material by any means , but it IS better than a rainy Sunday's tedium relief . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
Quite Well Done , Open Minded , and Open Ended	This documentary was very well presented . It does not attempt to convince you one way , or the other , but rather gives you the facts , the government explanations for these occurrences , and then gives you those sightings which were never explained in any form by any government , and allows you to make an informed opinion , based on the facts of the evidence itself , rather than simple belief or disbelief . This whole series , in fact , has proved itself to be largely unbiased one way or the other . They seem to wish to teach you , rather than lead you one way or the other . As someone who is a free-thinker , I like that approach . This was extremely educational , and rates an on the Documentary Scale from . . . the Fiend : .
Fills in the Blanks , Answers the Questions , And Delivers A Satisfactory Ending to the Franchise	This installment is far superior to Psycho 3 , but not quite as good as Psycho 2 , this final chapter answers all the questions , fills in all the blanks , and gives franchise fans a satisfactory ending to the Psycho run . Norman is back , and this time he's married . . . with children . He works through his Mother issues via a radio psychologist , and displaces some of his usual angst on his now pregnant wife , who is completely unaware that he's still suffering delusions , visions , and auditory hallucinations . Once the radio crew and staff figure out this is Norman Bates on the line , they begin to run a psychological con on him , in the attempts to reap a great radio show off of his twisted and sick mind . In the end , he decides that killing his pregnant wife is the only way to prevent another MONSTER being born . Will his mother finally win out ? or will love save the day ? Well , considering it's Norman Bates . . . what do YOU think ? This is good , but was made mainly for fans of the franchise . If you have not seen the previous three films , this will really make no sense , and serve no purpose . If you're a fan of Norm , this is must see but if not , it's really kind of pointless . I AM a fan , and as such , this installment rates an 8 . 0 from . . . the Fiend : .
Effective cat and mouse .	Very effective cat and mouse psychological thriller . Nice suspense even WITH Pacino . I'm not a fan of Al Pacino's work . I haven't really liked but 6 or so films he's ever done , so I didn't have high expectations of this movie . That , combined with my fore-knowledge that the copy I had skipped and fluttered , didn't have me on the edge of my seat to watch it . I watched this movie as a test study , actually . I watched this movie as a test study concerning the possible worth and watchability of the upcoming new release of Batman ( Batman 5 ) . Since Chris Nolan is listed as the director of this new undertaking , I thought I would check him out . I must say that I was delightfully surprised . This is a wonderful cat and mouse " time is running out " suspense with twists and turns you never expect . I found it unpredictable and edgy . Williams always struck me as the type who would do this genre quite well . I'm happy to see him spreading his wings beyond comedic / character acting . This could be the beginning of a whole new career for him . Quite honestly , I hope so . I have felt for some time that his style of comedy had just about run its course . Way to go , Robin Williams ! It must have taken great courage to try a movie like this , after all these years of comedy / dramas . Hats off . I will not outline the plot here . Everyone else does that and I find it tedious after a while . But I will say that if you like a good suspense , a dark quirky cat and mouse , this is the movie for you . Excellent remake , as well . That is indeed a rarity . And in conclusion , I feel that if Chris Nolan devotes the same level of darkness and atmosphere to Batman 5 that he did to this movie , he just may save the series and kick-start a whole new run of ( hopefully ) good Batman movies . Here's hoping . It rates a solid from . . . the Fiend : .
An excellent sequel to a most wonderful adventure !	I loved the Mummy , and I love the Mummy Returns ! I adore the CGI-created Army of Annubis , the wonderful recreations of ancient Egypt and the various creative devices used in this movie . What I did NOT adore / love was the horridly thrown together awful , Awful AWFUL CGI monster , the Scorpion King . You know , an audience can TELL when the movie was nothing more than a 2-hour long advertisement for the video game ! This wasn't , but it was oh so VERY close . The Scorpion King's character was so badly done , it nearly ruined the whole movie for me . . . kind of like the " monster " at the end of " Dreamcatcher . " This was HORRIBLE , and reminiscent of Atari's beginning video days , or claymation . Remember claymation ? coughs lame coughsNow that I've said that , the story line was FUN , the characters were endearing , well presented and developed , and the direction was wonderful . I loved the cinematography quality of this production . As sequels go , this one picks up a few years from the end of the first , and while we , the viewers have missed a lot , there is not so much that we feel left out or completely out of the loop . Evie and Rick are now married and have an eight year old son . The Bamebridge Scholars are no longer turning Evie away , but are after her to work with them now , though she prefers the field . In the field , they discover the Bracelet of Annubis , and their precocious child slips it on . MISTAKE ! I won't detail what happens after that . I LOVE this movie , the imagery scenes and sets . Absolutely wonderful production reminiscent of the Indiana Jones days . Everything was wonderful except for the horrible CGI treatment given to the Scorpion King . That really was awful !

An odd but satisfying blend	I was doubtful as to the quality of this endeavor , when it first hit the rags . Rock Music featured along with a medieval tale . Hmm . . . Frankly , it didn't sound like a good idea , but I attempted to keep an open mind . The first scene where this phenomenon was displayed , I was still doubtful . We Will Rock You is a great song , and one of my favorites from my youth , but it just did not feel right , considering the setting . But still , I attempted to keep an open mind . The cast was found to be above average in way of performance and the quality of energy they gave to the movie . I will have to stop here to add that Paul Bettany's performance alone ( even had he been the sole actor in this work ) was enough to salvage a botched attempt . He stole the show with a near brilliant performance . The story was a bit over that line of believability , but it was well written and executed well , so I won't fault it for that . There was this small ( but fitting ) quality of suspense where Ledger and his " foxy lady " were concerned , and it added a nice atmosphere to this love story which blended very well with the " Run " scene , later . All in all , it was very enjoyable . Some were disappointed , as they expected an action flick , rather than a love story with action elements . But it wasn't good . Not until the " show us a dance from Gelderland " scene . When David Bowie starts playing , it sealed the moment and framed it forever in my mind . I was thoroughly sold on this device . Now , true enough , it will fail with other scripts . The work has to be written for the music ; centered around the music , without allowing the music itself to interrupt the atmosphere and / or pace of the film . All this , they accomplished . The finished product was a great deal more than the mere sum of its parts , and shows itself to be an enjoyable and entertaining endeavor which played out to a satisfying end .

A deserving cult classic .	There are few fence-riders where this movie is concerned . Most fans of the genre of Horror and of the sub-genre of WereWolf movies either love this movie . . . or hate it . Let me begin by saying that I admire this movie very much . I enjoy watching it , and the two subsequent sequels . In my opinion , after the third Howling , they got stupid , hokey , campy , and just plain bad . Also , let me warn you that this movie is dated , slow , and has large blocks of uneventful moments where even the most base character development is not being utilized . But , with that having been said , the story is a good story . It is poorly executed due to the large slow spots I mentioned before , but the story was a sound and well-written one . Everything does not just magically come together . The reporting team there as moral and emotional support for ace reporter , Karen White ( Dee Wallace ) , is working very hard to put it together . Their discoveries do not come easy , but rather as a result of hard work , open-mindedness , and diligence . Not luck . The cinematography is mostly unremarkable , except for the scene in which Bill is attacked . The filmography is beautiful there , with the moonlight streaming out from behind two great trees , and the scene between is clear and lit by a beautifully brilliant silvery moonlight . Very good stuff . I also loved the use of The Wolf Man , 1941 with Lon Chaney , Jr . as a source for information in their research . This is an instance in which a movie used a real movie to quote , rather than some made-up movie . Wes Craven's use of this element was highly praised in the Scream Trilogy , and yet , here it is , twenty years earlier . This production also features a cameo by Forrest J . Ackerman , movie actor with credits in over 20 B-grade horror flicks , and a very good ( if somewhat over the top ) supporting performance by John Carradine . Naturally , most fans of the horror genre want to compare this movie to An American Werewolf in London . That is , of course , like comparing apples to submarines in that the former is a B production , with a small budget and the latter is a much larger funded project at exactly TEN times the budget . The Howling had a 17M return from a 1M investment , while AWiL had a 30 . 5M return from a 10M budget . Let's see . . . 17X the investment / 3 . 5X the investment . I'd have to say " The Howling " is the big winner , here , as far as profit goes . I use profit as a measuring stick , because it seems that profit is all Hollywood cares about anymore . Art and artistic expression no longer seems to be the point of film making these days . But for the sake of art , I loved both movies , this one and its competitor . The make up artistry used here was excellent , and actually worthy of the story . That , along with truly professional performances by Dee Wallace and Christopher Stone , make this an enjoyable and memorable film , which I have recently added to my DVD collection . All in all , I consider " The Howling " to be a benchmark film in the sub-genre of werewolf movies . It rates a hard-won from . . . the Fiend : .
New Life for the Child's Play Line ! !	First off , let me say that this movie is a horror COMEDY , as were the first four installments . Chucky is a wise-cracking villain ( don't f - - c-k with the Chuck ) to the point of almost soliciting a painful wince from time to time , but never going so far as to knock him into the same rung as the Leprechaun franchise , which is more splatter comedy than horror . This installment was the Child's Play version of " A New Nightmare " in that it has breathed some LIFE into the line , thereby salvaging it from the annals of has-been franchises . It is true to the original line , carries the same feeling as Bride of Chucky , introduces a gender-confused progeny , a few clever twists , and some excellent execution . SPOILERSJennifer Tilly is great as Jennifer Tilly AND as Tiffany Ray . The way she cracked on herself ( God ! She's so FAT ! And she's not even pregnant yet ! Tiffany Ray ) was priceless . At least . . . WE laughed . That was another thing . No one in the theater ( granted , there were only 16 people including us ) seemed to GET this attempt . We were laughing our butts off and everyone was looking at us like , " What are YOU laughing at ? " They were expecting a horror , perhaps ? LOL WE got it , and we loved it ! Chucky was Chucky . There was no change in his character ; a welcome element . Tiffany was much the same as she was in Bride of Chucky ; intelligent , deceitful , power hungry , and loving her man ( doll , whatever ) . The character of Glen / Glenda was a well developed , sensitive , confused little thing . It was great fun watching his / her character just . . . CRACK ! I found this venture to be creatively written and highly enjoyable . We were thoroughly entertained . The only thing missing , IMO , was the killing . The Child's Play line was built on blood , mayhem , and a wise-cracking possessed doll . While there was plenty of mayhem , there are precious few murder scenes . Although this attempt carries the " R " rating , let's hope the DVD release goes a bit farther in satisfying the blood-lust most Chucky fans experience . Otherwise , I'm afraid this installment will not be the golden road to rejuvenating the franchise that Don Mancini needs . END SPOILERSWhile Chucky is a " B " character , this was an " A " treatment , as was " Bride of Chucky . " It rates a solid on the " A " scale from . . . the Fiend : .
Charming cult classic	This is one of the few cult classics which deserves its status . It is a fun popcorn movie which does not take itself too seriously . A teenager-oriented flick , as was the norm of the 1980's , which holds fond memories for many of that era . It's become trendy to point out all the discrepancies in the science of this sci-fi / comedy , but they do not matter one bit to the casual movie goer , who will plug in this flick with a bowl of popcorn and lean back in that recliner for an hour and a half of good , wholesome family fun . And , frankly , they don't matter to me , either . This is not one of those sci-fi movies which demands that the science be put into the story in order for it to work . This works beautifully for the - lack - of the science . There is nothing to muddle the pace , mess with the timing of the comedic delivery , nor throw off the dramatic sequences . It is a very satisfying " coming of age " movie . All in all this is a very enjoyable and entertaining film which rates an from . . . the Fiend : .
Delightful Who-dunnit .	Silver Streak ; an homage to the 1934 original , Hitchcock and the " Road " team of Hope and Martin . Wonderful parody / satire action / comedy starring Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor . This is the first in a wonderful lovely run of Wilder / Pryor movies . In true Hitchcock style ( North by Northwest ) , Colin Higgins's ( Harold and Maude , Foul Play , Nine to Five and the Best Little Whorehouse in Texas ) brilliantly written screenplay lends largely to this very successful finished product . This , the first vehicle co-starring Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor , is the best of their joint endeavors . Also featuring Richard Kiel , " Jaws " of James Bond movies " Moonraker " and " The Spy Who Loved Me ; " Jill Clayburgh , Patrick McGoohan , Scatman Crothers , Ray Walston , Clifton James , Ned Beatty and a plethora of other cameos . After ( almost ) witnessing the murder of Hilly's ( Clayburgh , his love interest ) boss , Prof . Schreiner , George ( Wilder ) finds himself in a very precarious situation . He visits Prof . Schreiner's cabin aboard the silver streak , to see what he can uncover and is man-handled off the train by the beloved " Jaws . " ( Reace in this production . ) George manages to get himself back on the Silver Streak and tries to convince Hilly of the reality of her boss's death . But there seems to be a misunderstanding , as Prof . Schreiner is there in his cabin , seemingly fine and dandy . This is a really nice " who-dunnit " with a delightful romance , intrigue , and lively comedic action with scenery and lovely cinematography . For me , this movie is a bit reminiscent of " Murder on the Orient Express . " While Wilder's character is no Hercule Poirot , there are some similar factors . It also contains the same serious but comedic effect found in " Foul Play , " Chevy Chase / Goldie Hawn vehicle also written by Colin Higgins in which a man is murdered , his body subsequently disappears and it is up to Goldie Hawn's character to puzzle out who the man was , what happened , and why . It also reminds one a bit of " Seems Like Old Times , " another Hawn / Chase collaboration . Gene Wilder is absolutely wonderful in this role . I honestly love each and every one of the productions in which he has starred from " Death of a Salesman , " 1966 to " The Lady in Question , " 1999 . It is my opinion ; however , that this is one of his best , although " Haunted Honeymoon " is its superior . Wilder is a serious comic , with no pratt-falls , and no stupid one-liners , just intelligent , witty and lovable dialog , much of which is ad-libbed and classic Wilder . His portrayals are genuine , honest and forthright . You get the sense of knowing his characters , which is a key element for any successful film . His honest portrayals make all of his characters believable , familiar , and lovable , even when his character is a hapless schmuck . The introduction of Grover ( Pryor ) happens in a creatively unorthodox manner , and once again , George manages to get back on the Silver Streak , this time , with Grover in tow . Now , with all remnants of the evil facade aside , George begins to extract the answers he needs , in order to fit the pieces together . This is an absolutely enjoyable production with a great cast turning in professional performances ; good , strong dialog ; a coherent plot ; cohesive story line ; imaginative direction ; excellent scenery ; and brilliant casting .

Sweet and Offbeat	This is a quirky and sometimes serious romantic comedy , which caught me by surprise . I wasn't prepared to view the quality performances with which I was presented in this film . I like GÃ©rard Depardieu's work , and I've always loved Andie McDowell , but for some reason , I couldn't see this work turning in anything beyond fluff . I'm happy to report that I was surprised by the " cuteness " factor exhibited herein .

Inferior but fun in spite of itself	I enjoy sequels in that it is always fun to watch people's reactions to them . What do they expect ? They expect a good continuation of the original story . What do they get ? They get a mindless monkey-making vehicle with little or no consideration given to the consumer . This was no different . However , it is a decent continuation of the original . Not good , but decent . I did enjoy the story , but the premise was over-used and a bit dog-eared ( pun intended for those of you who have seen it ) . What I do enjoy about this movie is that when you play MIB 1 & 2 , back-to-back , it plays like one long movie . The science in this installment is a bit better than in the original , but the comedic element gets a bit tired after a time . As I've said , in my opinion , Will Smith is highly over-rated , and should be replaced , if Barry Sonnenfeld decides to do another one of these . Other critics have declared their disdain for Frank the Pug having too much screen time , but compared to Smith , I think I preferred the little fur ball . When we left the MIB at the end of the first installment , K had resumed his normal , mundane life . But now , because K was the only agent with knowledge of a mysterious alien artifact , J has to recover K , restore his memory , and get him back in black . With the help of Frank the Pug ( the scene in the car with " Who Let the Dogs Out " and Frank is the most endearing scene IN the movie ) , J sets out on his mission , but he has very little time . If the artifact is not returned , Earth could be vaporized . We discover a few things about K's past of which we had no prior clues and it leads to a nice ending elemental twist .

Great Fun , Wonderful Innovatives for an Animation , and a Great Cast .	Okay , I like this . I mean I really like this . Yes , this IS another " coming of age " family tale told via penguins . Yes , this IS another animated kid's movie with a " message " told via penguins . Yes , this IS one movie's attempt to defeat a similar movie with its " awesomeness " at the box office . Sony could have actually pulled that one off , had it extended the budget to include some kind of ad promo that would have worked , but as it is , Warner Brothers is the clear winner with a near $400MUS take a solid year after the release of Happy Feet . But Warner Brother's budget was four times that of Sony's , and while Warner Brother's movie is fun , it does not quite have the heart of " Surf's Up . " Cody Maverick wants to learn how to surf . He learns , and finds himself along the way . That is the synopsis in a nutshell . The work seems a little full of itself , but only on the surface . The message is that being the center of things is not what's important . Family , friends , and spending quality time with those you love , is what's important . I think with Paris Hilton out there plaguing the world , this lesson is not insignificant . A beautifully stylized presentation is backed up by some awesome talent for the voice parts , a unique story vehicle whereby the message is delivered , and some great innovative ideas for actual delivery of the movie itself . The style is smooth , if not slick , and the finished product is more than a fun movie . The total sum of its parts is heightened by the blending , rendering this as one of my new favorites ( with Cars , Ratatouille , and Open Season ) . It rates an from . . . the Fiend : .
Again , I'm in the Minority : I Liked It !	While this work is a far cry from the original , it is such merely due to a preponderance of Samara's story , thereby negating the stylish mystique generated by the predecessor . Therefore , this work is more typical than a-typical of American horror movies , and as such , it plays more or less like what one might expect of an American horror sequel in that it breaks its own rules , omits information given the audience in the previous installment , and thus bears less credibility than The Ring . However , in spite of the story variations , and other moderate problems , this sequel is still quite enjoyable . The performances contributed by David Dorfman and Naomi Watts were exemplary , and the story itself still bears a wonderful , darkling atmosphere . True , the atmosphere is not as serious or thick as the first , but it is still quite enjoyable . If you like horror movies in general , and enjoyed the original , I would suggest a viewing , in spite of the naysayers . I , at least , liked it . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
Folded , but in a different way .	Folded , but in a different way . A father / son drama is the central story , although surrounding that , we are given the gut-wrenching story of conflict diamonds , their mining , a few of the purposes they serve , the marketing of them , and how dramatically they change lives . This is story driven , with a little action ( all of it violent ) , some gripping drama , and a compelling plot . The dialog is gritty and heartbreaking . I both loved and hated it . It is a tremendously well done movie , but it is on a short list of movies I love but never want to see again . This is depressingly poignant and real . All in all ?

Edgy , suspenseful , dramatic . For what more could you ask ?	Edgy , suspenseful , dramatic . For what more could you ask ? This has to be one of Bogey's best performances , but how can you tell ? All his performances were darned good , but this time he seems almost relaxed even as his character goes through some major changes . His apparent relaxed state does not in any way translate to a dialed-in performance or a seeming calm where he should be anything but , but comes off more as a comfort within his own skin ; a confidence and self assured quality he seemed just shy of , in past performances . Although I'm no fan of war movies , I've never seen a Bogey performance I didn't like . But Key Largo carries with it a large amount of suspense that starts from the early scenes , and survives all the way through to the very end , with no release or break . This must have had theater patrons literally on the edge of their seats way back when . We were more innocent as a nation then . . . as a society . All in all ? I cannot recommend this for younger viewers , as there is a base roughness in it most modern movies , even with all the cursing and gore , never seem to achieve . I suppose that , in our innocence , it wasn't just our naivetÃ© as a society that was heightened , but our darkness , as well . This is very well written with believable dialog and tremendously enigmatic characters . I love it . It rates a solid on the B & W scale from . . . the Fiend : .
Not Your Average Ghost Movie , And DEFINITELY NOT For Younger Movie-Goers !	While this work is appropriately dated these days , it is still one of the most compelling ghost flicks on the shelves . Barbara Hershey is awesome in the lead , and really delivers her all in this work . I found it quite disturbing , and downright spooky , considering this work is based on a true story ; one which bears some documentation . This is one of my favorites , due to the quality performance contributed by Hershey , but also due to the " true life " factor . It cuts right through any pretense and goes straight to the meat of the matter . This is a worthy addition to any horror / ghost movie collection . It rates an from . . . the Fiend : .
What Batman Was Supposed To Be !	Quite possibly the movie of the year , but I have yet to see War of the Worlds . I went into this thinking , " They've DONE the whole Batman thing . Why put us through it AGAIN ? ! The first Burton / Keaton Batman was da bomb . " Returns " was decent , " Forever " was entertaining but sadly lacking . Seriously , with a cast like Drew Barrymore , Jim Carrey , Tommy Lee Jones , Nicole Kidman , Val Kilmer , and Kevin Grevioux ( Raze of Underworld fame ) , how could Schumacher screw that up ? Well , he found a way , and with the release of " Batman & Robin , " it became painfully obvious that the end of Batman was more than just " in sight , " it was here . I grieved the death of what could have been a terrific franchise , and I moved on . Then along comes Goyer . He wrote " Blade : Trinity , " and while I am NO fan of that movie , we'll blame the studio's cut and Parker Posey's horrible acting . . . for now . I will give him the benefit of the doubt because he has also written some great screenplays and stories . Blade , Blade 2 , and Dark City are all his , but his writing abilities seem to be more hit-and-miss than substantially consistent talent . Christopher Nolan directs and kicks in his two cents ' worth in the screenplay department . . . I'm not impressed with his body of work . I liked Insomnia , but let's face it : Nothing I'd seen so far said to me that Batman Begins would even be watchable , much less entertaining . To be honest , I didn't even WANT to like this movie for several reasons . . . Michael Keaton did so well with Batman Schumacher was so total in his obliteration of the franchise , I could not see any reason to beat the dead horse A fan of the " Dark Knight " I was tired of being disappointed at the cinema by the direction in which the franchise had goneI must say that I'm very glad I saw this in the theater ( on the " big screen " ) . Just think ; I almost missed witnessing a true rebirth of this franchise ! The casting was work of art in itself . Some unlikely choices really REALLY pay off . Two character actors were cast against type , but it seems to have been a brilliant choice ! Also , Bale was excellent in his performance . His performance was so reminiscent of Michael Keaton's that you can not help but believe that his entire performance was an homage . It didn't come off leaving you feeling like he was attempting to " copy " his performance , but rather it further cements in your mind that Keaton IS Batman , and Bale knows it . The effects were dynamic , and the sets and backgrounds were more than realistic . The stunts seemed to be more wire work than CGI ( thankfully ) , lending a more believable and realistic feel to this endeavor . And gone ( again , thankfully ) are the hideous nipples from the Bat-Suit ! ( Curses Joel Schumacher for ever adding them in ! ! ) The thing which most impressed me about this film was the story . It was fantastic ! I've read reviews by the " professional " reviewers , and one in particular claimed that the movie got lost in the beginning to find itself again only at the end . I'm learning NOT to listen to the " professional " reviewers and to judge for myself . I have to say that by going through the changes in the beginning , you fully understand the motivations and abilities demonstrated by the Dark Knight . Because quite frankly , this isn't just Batman anymore . If the new franchise follows this first installment , it will literally BE the Dark Knight vein of the comic book series ! THIS is the Batman I grew up with , not the campy , weak - @ ss byotch who cracks off one-liners while feebly dealing justice to ineptly stupid criminal miscreants . Adam West was " A " Batman . Michael Keaton was " THE " Batman . Bale is the Dark Knight ; it's a totally different animal . The nemeses in this one are Ra's Al Ghul and the Scarecrow , with a promise of meeting the Dark Knight's " Joker " in the next installment ! This movie exhibits perfect direction from start to finish , never loses itself , never loses the audience , and with great relish fights its way through to a superb and satisfying ending . I can't WAIT for the next one ! It gets an and yes , that's a big leap from the rating I gave Burton's Batman cuz let's face it : Bale isn't a better Batman , but the movie itself is LIGHTYEARS better ! . . . from . . . the Fiend : .
Dark , atmospheric chiller	I must admit that I loved this movie , mainly for the mere presence of Karloff and Chaney . Their performance , to Me , was excellent fare . I was not very impressed with Frankenstein's monster here , but that in no way took away from the final product . This was an excellent addition to the Universal line with John Carradine as Dracula , Chaney reprising his role as the Wolf Man , and Glenn Strange as the monster . Karloff was on the other side of the controls in this venture , and he was just as good here in the role of the doctor as he was in previous attempts as the monster . This is a most deserving sequel in the Universal Frankentein line , and definitely one for the collection . This was purchased as part of Universal's Frankenstein Legacy Collection box set ; a wonderful way to own all 5 of the Universal Frankenstein installments . Simply excellent . It rates an from . . . the Fiend : .
It seems that most people either love this work , or hate it .	This is , further into the movie , a strong sequel . Karloff is more comfortable in his role as the misunderstood creation of a mad man . Some might think this would make an actor sloppy with the representation , but it did no such thing . Karloff was astounding ! This is also the second chapter of the Frankenstein saga parodied by Mel Brooks in " Young Frankenstein . " If you are of the generation who venerates Brooks , there are doubtless countless scenes in which you will find familiarity . The movie begins on an odd note . Mary Shelley insists that her work was unappreciated as a " tale of morality " and considered a work of fantasy alone . She then regales us with part two of the tale . Doctor Henry Frankenstein has been convinced by all around him that his genius was a sickness of both the mind and the spirit , and therefore , he must be " cured " of his intellect . Tormented in his current state of confusion and conflicted desires , Henry is ripe for the coercion of an even more troubled scientist who has grown his race of man from seed only to discover they are four inches tall . He needs Henry's insights and knowledge in order to make his race a reality by resurrecting a mate for his earlier creation . The monster , meanwhile , has survived the burning windmill and is in search of his own humanity . Karloff's performance is nothing short of brilliance and even Clive seems more involved in his portrayal . In some ways , this production surpasses the original In others , it is inferior . As surprising as that is , these inconsistencies in no way make for an uneven work . This production feels almost schizophrenic in its quiet urgency one moment and its in your face delivery the next . It is quite compelling work . The performances are not nearly as cryptic or over the top as one might expect from a 1935 production . The few bits which were over the top were required for the moment . I actually enjoy this installment quite a bit . It picks up where the last chapter left off , and it continues with a quality which is comparable to the first . That was quite a feat . The finished product presented by the Universal Legacy Collection features a fully restored soundtrack and digital transfer from the best source Universal could locate . Unfortunately , these are only available in Full Screen format . All in all , even with the " I Love Lucy - " era music peppered here and there , this is a wonderful installment and still a classic , no matter how dated this work becomes .

Entertaining horror spoof of a more innocent time .	As the spunky , witty typesetter of the local newspaper who is sometimes afraid of his own shadow , Don Knotts goes up against the local legendary haunted house , a garden-shears-carrying nemesis , and a real true to life bad guy in this funny , quirky , endearing mystery from Universal's 1966 archives .

Some of Martin's best work !	First , this review is for Father of the Bride 1 AND 2 . If run back to back , they run like one beautiful story . This production is great from start to finish . Everything about it is wonderful , including the story , the acting performances and the direction . This is the best example of Martin's versatility as an actor . His comedic style is rather straight with zany insertions to highlight the otherwise serious atmosphere of his performances . He plays a wonderful straight man-turned-comic-turned straight man . This movie is no exception . His performance is comedic , yet startlingly genuine . Martin Short is hilarious and Diane Keaton is just as genuine in her portrayal of Steve Martin's wife as is Martin's . I love this movie . I love its ability to make you commiserate with Martin's character ; with how he feels , and what he's going through . This one brings up every emotion in the spectrum , and I love it . It's less about family , and more about life's curves ; the every-day things that make us crazy , happy , sad , and ultimately stronger . It's entertaining and at the same time makes you think , consider , ponder the events which have led us to where we are now . Combined , they rate from . . . the Fiend : .
Finally ! Jamie Lee Curtis is BACK !	Jamie Lee Curtis is now 40 ( that's 32 in movie years , as she was 20 playing a 17 year old in the original , so it works out ) , it's twenty years after the original " Halloween " movie and she is no longer Laurie Strode , but Keri Tate , the headmistress of a posh private academy in California . She is divorced , and has a son , John , who is now . . . you guessed it . 17 . The acting is poignant ; much more than you've come to expect from this series . The plot is creatively executed . . . Laurie has finally just had . . . enough , and insists on her " Sigourney Weaver moment . " I love it . It's the best of the sequels ! The ending of this movie is dead on , and I mean . . . dead . . . on . I won't detail the plot , but it was wonderfully dark , brooding , and atmospheric . Even though this is another teenager slasher flick , it is vastly superior in its content and execution of this sub-genre and this franchise . This was a most excellent and deserving sequel to what had become a tired franchise , and is my favorite of the line . It gets a from . . . the Fiend : .
Highly Enjoyable , In Spite of Its Flaws	Complete with a " Marlow and Me " hound , our hero is thoroughly American in spite of the claim that he belongs to the world . Frank Langella's Perry White asks , " Does he still stand for truth . . . justice ? " without completing the question by adding , " . . . the American Way . " I found it offensive that this was left as it is . Superman is an American hero . Where is " the American Way ? " I was NOT amused . Also , there is NO American Flag anywhere in this movie . What is UP with this ? Again , I was NOT amused . However . . . Kevin Spacey is probably the best Lex Luthor ever ! As the Ralph Finnes of this series , his presence is subsequently dark and fiendishly clever . Spacey is awesome as the arch-nemesis of Superman . Simply awesome . This movie features several original tracks from Superman with Christopher Reeve , of Marlon Brando's voice and image . That is the most fitting homage which could have been paid . Nice touch , Singer . What did disappoint slightly is seeing Brian Singer's name approximately 8 times in the opening credits . Singer is a faithless lover . He has " done it again " with Superman Returns , but can we trust him to remain true this time ? Will he ditch this franchise for the next one like he did X-Men , when the mood ( and the paycheck ) strikes him ? He is listed as being in negotiations to write and direct the next installment , but he was also listed with X-Men 3 before he bailed , so the jury's still out on that one . Thankfully , this is a sequel and NOT a remake , as was first announced . I am personally very happy that this work uplifts Reeve's prior work , rather than negates it . Also present were dedications to Reeve and his now deceased wife . Without it , we fans of the Reeve movies would have risen up in rebellion . Also , there is a nice cameo mention of Gotham City ! Again , nice touches . Well , that is not entirely accurate . It IS a remake , but it is a remake of Superman 3 . The studios decided to ignore the 3rd ( boo ! ! ! ) and 4th ( good move ! ) installments of Superman's 70's-80's run , and begin again , but not all the way back to the beginning . I have mixed feelings about this , as I LOVE the 3rd installment with Rich , but they didn't take that away from the Ultimate Superman Collection , so I won't fuss too much . When watching Superman 2 , the Donner Cut and then Superman Returns , this movie flows seamlessly . Parker Posey . I can only say I did not hate her performance this time around . This is the first time , by the way , that her voice did not create the " fingernails on the chalkboard " phenomena for me . I have to admit that this was also the first time I drew some enjoyment from a Parker Posey character . I hope this portends her future performances . Kate Bosworth is a huge disappointment for this reviewer . Of course , I never expected much , as her work has never appealed to me , but here , she is simply lifeless . She dialed in her weak performance which was so barely adequate , that it left Routh and Huntington to take up her slack . Sam Huntington , on the other hand , is a convincing Jimmy Olsen . His bright , fresh face and " golly , gee-whiz " persona is fresh and pure , and straight from the 1950's . He is most excellent as Olsen . Which leads us to Brandon Routh . I had doubts . He is not Christopher Reeve , and frankly , I was not interested in a Superman movie without Christopher Reeve . I am happy to report that I was misgiven in my disdain of such a proposition . It is downright eerie how much Routh resembles Christopher Reeve . It is just spooky . He is every bit as good as Superman , as Bale is as Batman . No doubts . There are nice twists , clever story , and awesome effects , which are nearly overridden by a complete lack of color and life . Even Superman's newly redesigned costume is almost totally lacking in color . Other than that , the costume rethinking is extremely clever , with only tasteful changes , which do not alter his appearance or our perceptions of him beyond a glaring lack of an American Flag anywhere in sight . Fortunately , there were no extreme costume changes to put off the average movie-goer ; much unlike Schumacher's addition of nipples to the Bat-Suit . Oy Vey . As previously mentioned , the principal photography and color scheme is too dark for my tastes . Not in mood or atmosphere , but in contrast , depth , and color . It takes something of the " life " which would have otherwise been adherent to this work , away . Because of this over-thinking ( or just bad choices on Singer's part ) , I found the visuals to be unremarkable . It is clearly a shame , as the work itself is beautifully executed . The color choices were obvious , glaring , and detracting . I do have to state that this work is much too violent for younger children , unless you do not consider a realistic and graphic portrayal of the bad guys beating the living daylights out of Superman and ultimately stabbing him to death with a Kryptonite shard , too violent . In that event , do not bother with listening to my admonitions . Otherwise , I would view the movie before allowing small children to . My favorite part ? The cannibalistic canine scene . " Weren't there two of those ? " What a HOOT ! In summation , this work features great action , clever story with nice twists , and stellar performances ( for the most part ) . It just needed some freaking color and a better , more enthusiastic score . It was highly enjoyable , in spite of its flaws . It rates an from . . . the Fiend : .
Fun and entertaining modern rethinking of an old classic .	What a wonderful adventure ! This is one of my ( many ) favorite movies ! ! Let me start this by saying that badly done CGI , like bad acting , should be avoided at all costs and should NEVER be allowed to be included in the finished product of any production . Case and point : the Scorpion King from Mummy Returns . It was horrible ; deplorable ; and just downright nasty-looking . He was no better than the worst video game character ever drawn by an 8 year old in green crayon . Okay , that having been said , the argument in the industry is that CGI is taking jobs away from LIVE actors and giving them to computer nerds . That is simply NOT the case . Case and point : again , Mummy Returns . Do you honestly believe the producers would have paid two million extras the standard SAG fees and make up artists for these two million extras , or wardrobe for these two million extras to comprise the Army of Annubis ? The answer is a resounding HLL NO ! My point is that before the diversity of CGI became known , movies lacked SO MUCH in detail . You either had the omission of the army all together , or about 20 shots of the same fifteen guys , all in different costumes , trying in vain to make it SEEM as though there was an army . Either way , what you got was deplorable . CGI definitely has its place in cinema . Another prime example of excellent CGI in use is in this production , " The Mummy . " The opening sequence of the WORKING ancient Egyptian city of Thebes is one of the most awe-inspiring film sequences I've ever experienced , but Ancient History is a hobby of mine . The only time I have any problem at all with CGI is when it's badly done , as in the example I mentioned earlier . It greatly enhances our ability to enjoy the story when the eye-candy is well done and in place . Those shots of the Army of Annubis are simply staggering . They look realistic and they are so well done as to make you believe , if only for a moment , that they ARE real . The love story between Imhotep and Anck Su Namun is a classic , and is as historically correct as that of Isis and Osiris , and while this is classified as a " remake , " I simply do not care to compare this epic to the original hit . How can you compare a true masterpiece of horror from 1932 ; a time when there were NO believable effects , no mastered technology of CGI , and the standard SAG fees for extras was around $6 a day . ( It WAS the depression era , after all ) Since the development of the technology used in " Star Wars , Episode 4 , A New Hope , " computer effects have evolved into a true state of art . I have absolutely no beef with CGI , its use , nor the use of it over live actors . As I have already stated above , my only problem with CGI is when it is badly done . In this movie , it was NOT badly done . I loved the " Indiana Jones " adventure feel of this movie . I loved the fact that they took a dark and dreary ( badly done , in my opinion ) original campy old horror flick and turned it into an absolute feast for those of us who love the eye candy . I am also an Ancient History hobbyist , and this movie really sparked my imagination . As I've already stated , the opening scenes of Thebes were so inspiring , I was hooked from the very first moment this movie began to play on the big screen . Brendan Fraser , to me , demonstrates his acting abilities in this production , showing his agents and all those around him that he is SO much above frivolous drivel like " Monkey Bone " and " Encino Man . " I hope he never EVER has to resort to such a waste of his talents , again . Rachael Weisz is a sheer delight . Her character is totally believable , romantic , soft and lady-like while maintaining a tough interior personality . Not easily done . Bravo , Ms . Weisz ! What an excellent performance ! I will not detail the plot here , as there are hundreds of reviews already posted to this site about this movie , alone .

It scared me then , it scares me now .	I was much too young to read this William Blatty novel . At the ripe old age of nine , I found it lying around and read it . I had to hide it . I instinctively knew that if my mom had found me with it , she would have been quite disturbed . But I had read more advanced works already , and understood most of what I read . What I did not understand , the dictionary was readily available to assist me in my quest . I didn't sleep for about ten days . I would go to sleep , but I would not stay there long . I finally had to confess my trespass to my mother , who countered the book's nightmare-like qualities with a " good , healthy dose of Disney . " I honestly understood Joel , Wednesday , and Pugsly's horror in " Addams Family Values " at receiving the same treatment . Somehow , my dreams went from Exorcist-like nightmares , to beloved Disney characters doing horrible , unthinkable things to me , and one another . But I digress . This is still one of the scariest movies I've ever seen . I recently purchased the Director's Cut on DVD and THIS is the movie I remember from the book . . . if that makes sense . The movie , until they re-added the lost footage , was NOT as scary as the book . This version very much IS . This movie also shows you where Dee Snyder got the idea for the name of his character in his movie " Strangeland , " another very disturbing , if not scary , movie . Captain Howdy is the name of the entity with which Reagan speaks through the Ouija board . The Ouija board is the device which opened her to the possession in the first place , by the way .

Horror Maven , Wes Craven , Does it Again ! !	The best , most realistic movie featuring zombies and the darker aspects of the Haitian way of life ever made ! While this movie was billed as a " true story , " one must remember it was " BASED ON " a true story . The story surrounding the actual facts , well , that is up to the viewer to decide . That not withstanding , this was a purely entertaining endeavor with some of the best elements of voodoo mysticism I've ever seen . This movie was extremely disturbing for me on many levels . The story was compelling , the acting was exceptional , the dialog was believable to those who are enlightened , the sets and scenery was breathtakingly realistic , and this production was even greater than the sum of its marvelous parts . It was frightening , suspenseful , intriguing , and thrilling . We were horrified , dismayed and thoroughly entertained by this endeavor .

Darkly atmospheric , if not downright terrifying	I'll start this off by saying that this review is not for the theatrical version , but the extended Director's Cut from the Quadrilogy Collection . While this movie is some 25 years old , it hardly feels dated at all , aside from the actors appearing so young in comparison to now . Also , aside from " Gorillas In The Mist , " this is some of the best work of Sigourney Weaver's career . Ridley Scott , although relatively new to the cinematic scene at this time with only two theatrical directions under his belt , was prolific in direction through the media of television . While these are two totally different animals , he demonstrated a thorough understanding of the way things should be done . He introduces his characters and builds their development in a nice , easy flow without boring his audience with what can sometimes be a tedious demonstration of humanity . He introduces his story , gives you a sketchy outline through dialog clever in that it does provide that outline and backdrop of the situation at hand while eluding to what will be coming up , without giving it to you on a silver platter . Obscurity ( hiding things in the shadows ) is a virtue when building suspense , and he proves with Alien that , even at this early stage of development in his career , he has mastered that phenomenon . As the tension builds , so the story deepens , providing you with highly suspenseful , edge-of-your-seat moments , and some really good scares , as the story itself is strong enough to draw you in . The " monster " this time is , as the title would indicate , an Alien , but one the likes of which you've never seen . It is intelligent , bestial , brutal , and yet beautiful . The Alien is born of a pod lovingly laid by its Queen Mother , then reborn by way of a warm-blooded host . Reborn pregnant , it immediately seeks to impregnate another warm-blooded host with its spawn , thereby insuring the proliferation of the Alien species . Very clever writing , dramatic and carefully controlled performances , some excellent effects , and amazing camera work combine to make this a sure sci-fi / horror classic . We knew it would be , as soon as we saw it . It rates an from . . . the Fiend : .
Wow ! What A Surprise ! AKA Renegade	Vincent Cassel , Michael Madsen , Juliette Lewis . A Cajun lawman faces an enemy from the past . Based on the comics by Moebius . I have to begin this review by stating that I have NOT read these particular comics . But I AM a great fan of good westerns . They are , for me , far between , and few in number . I have certain requirements of a Western , which I do not hold for other movies . Call me a " western elitist . " Renegade is one of the very few movies , which possesses the entire repertoire of quintessential elements necessary to make a good western . It devotes adequate character development to your lead . It shows the supporting woman as a strong empowered goddess , not a shrew , a tramp , or a hair-brained ninny . It features a villainous villain , rather than a mere shade of villainy ; and it is respectful of itself , without taking itself too seriously and thereby going over the top in the fight scenes . What I love about this work is that it is respectful of the Native American traditions , in spirit AND tone , without losing the edge of the American Western . This has to be the best Western I have ever seen , and I've seen plenty in my time . All in all , this work is suspenseful , action-filled , with a good flow and some awesome supernatural elements which weren't just tossed in , but were as well written as was the execution . It also rates exactly the same as Tombstone , in my book , but for different reasons . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
Superior To " Modern " Remakes , And Comparable To Universal's Horror Classics !	You know ? Both remakes over the last seventy years have earned ( rightfully , in my opinion ) terrible reviews , this original work is at least as atmospheric and genuinely eerie as most of the 30's Universal horrors , and far more so than the remakes . This is a genuinely superior work , which goes vastly under-rated due to the failure of the better-known remakes . Featuring a then-unknown Charles Laughton , and some pro-active pacing and dialog , argument can be successfully made for slotting this film as the greatest of the 1930's horrors . My favorite is Frankenstein , Universal Pictures , but argument could be made and won . If you like the old classic horrors , mad scientist flicks , or creature features , this is definitely worth your time . Honestly , it deserves a place in your collection !

Beautiful Love Story , Gene Wilder Stylized Perfection	This production was built around the search for the next Rudolph Valentino . While this work has become dated , it was filmed as a pseudo-retrospective at the time , so it was already " dated " the day it was filmed . This is a total Gene Wilder vehicle . He wrote the screenplay , directed the movie , and was the movie's sole credited producer . He is also THE star of the movie . He does share the limelight with Carol Kane ( a pure delight , as usual ) , but this was one of Wilder's brightest moments . By this time , the world realized they had a comedic genius on their hands and after this work Wilder pretty much had the Midas Touch for a while . Kane plays Annie Hickman , the world's greatest Valentino fan . Wilder portrays a Milwaukean baker who is at the end of his rope . His idiosyncrasies are so severe , he finds it impossible to maintain employment . Upon learning of a contest held by Rainbow Studios ( NOT the # 1 studio ) to find the next Rudolph Valentino , Rudy Hickman just " knows " this is his ticket to a better life . His wife leaves him to go find Mr . Valentino . But once Hickman is in the middle of it all , he realizes his wife is what is most important to him and he sets the works in motion to woo her away from Rudolph Valentino . The formula makes for some of the best heart-warming entertainment that's hit the big screen . It's endearing and funny in its bittersweet malaise . It also goes a long way towards showing what CAN be done with no effects and no locations beyond the Studio Backlot and a few , cheap but decent sets . While it is frayed about the edges , this classic favorite is one ripe for a DVD restoration . . . perhaps even a 2-disk director's cut for those of us fans who have BEEN fans since the beginning .

Perfect Capture of Characters	I'm a comic book fan . Ghost Rider is one which many collectors and readers found obscure in comparison to many , but it was always one of my personal favorites . As such , I expected an effects-extravaganza , a good performance from Cage , and a barely palatable story line . You know . . . the usual . Well , I'm happy to say that I got more than I bargained for with Ghost Rider . The effects were beautiful-lovingly done , and the performances by all involved were exemplary . . . that was no surprise ; with a cast like Sam Elliott and Nicolas Cage , I would never expect anything less . But the STORY . THAT was what caught me by surprise . You know , a comic book series-any comic book series-is constructed of a chronologically progressive story . Sure , there are prequels and spin-offs , flash-backs , flash-forwards , and even a few that flash sideways , but the base story line goes from beginning to end . Therefore , it has been difficult for many screenwriters , studio executives , directors , and producers to commit comic book lines to film . A few have done it successfully . Batman Begins , X-Men the Franchise , and Spiderman are about the best , in my opinion . I had serious issues with the new " Super - " man , but that's for another review . In Ghost Rider , the story doesn't attempt to do too much , and thereby , does not contain the huge holes , missing chronological chunks , base characters , and / or supporting cast members . This story is about Johnny Blaze , what he was , and what he becomes . It is also a beautiful homage to the idea of " Passing on the Torch , " in its inclusion of the Sam Elliott character . This movie was probably THE best comic book movie I've ever seen . It wasn't the flashiest . It didn't have the most KABOOM effects . It didn't give you the most kills , or the best splatter . This movie was a story-driven , graphically supported vehicle , which superbly entertains . Beyond that , however , is the fact that the writers here have epitomized Ghost Rider's principal characters ; Blackheart and Blaze . This demonstrates more than the embodiment of the heart and fire of these characters-it captured their essence . My one gripe ?

Breathing new life into a masterful creation	I was expecting very little in the way of this sequel . The others grew tired and lifeless , with on again , off again , decent performances turned in by Robert Englund as Freddy , and some decent , not so decent script writing . Frankly , you just never know what TO expect with long-running franchises such as this . But what I got was NOT what I expected . Nothing close . I had to view this three times . At my first viewing , I was so surprised , I immediately said , " I need to watch this again . " Upon my third viewing , I realized that what I was watching was the resurrection of one of my favorite franchises ! I was ( if only momentarily ) struck speechless . I'm trying not to " gush " here , or exaggerate , so do not take it lightly when I say that I believe this is possibly the most creative work Craven has ever directed . Don't get me wrong , aside from " Last House on the Left , " I've enjoyed everything Craven's put out , including those annoyingly clichÃ©d " Scream " movies . ( Just for your info though , I only didn't like Last House on the Left because I do not find entertainment in exploitation , it IS a fine low budget , independent exploitation film , just not my cup of tea . ) But " New Nightmare " is just not a recycling of the same tired old story with a new kick . It's a new take on a long-standing favorite BY the creator . For what more could you ask ? It rates an easy from . . . the Fiend : .
Timeless Muppet Classic .	Fozzie and the two banana brothers have to stop jewel thieves in England . This isn't the best Muppet flick , but it is the next best . Filmed as a Muppet-noir , this work is not only fun , but also interesting , with great characters to work alongside our favorite Muppets . Again , filled with cameos of some of the greatest stars of the age , this is a sure classic and belongs in any Muppet collection . Watch the mystery unfold within the comforts of your favorite Muppet Characters . This rates an from . . . the Fiend : .
Rousing !	One of the very best of this series , Star Trek 2 : The Wrath of Khan gives you the battles and action for which you were so hungry . A veritable feast for Trekkies , and all other sci-fi fans , alike . Ricardo Montalban reprises his role as Khan ; a genetically mutated humanoid who has powers and strengths beyond that of mankind . Longevity , apparently is one of those powers . Exiled on Seti Alpha 5 , Khan and his crew were to have a chance at life in a place where they could no longer interfere with Star Fleet and the affairs of man . But Chekov inadvertently stumbles up on the shell of the Botany Bay , Khan's ship , and realizes immediately what a mistake he has made . He attempts to flee , but it is too late . Khan wants to avenge the death of his wife ; an event for which he blames Admiral James Tiberius Kirk , and he will not rest until he can extract his revenge . It seems Kirk never checked on Khan and his crew , and sometime after they were deposited there , Seti Alpha 5 became a desolate wasteland with murderous creatures which burrow and move beneath the sands . Meanwhile , Kirk is going through what seems to be a mid-life crisis which is interrupted to deal with the travesties of space , and one of Kirk's many love interests , Dr . Carol Marcus , has developed the " Genesis Project ; " a device which can create new planets from dead ones , asteroids , and the like . But were this device to be used where life already existed , it would destroy the present life in favor of the new matrix , thereby making it a very devastating and dangerous weapon in the wrong hands . Khan has learned of Genesis , and seeks to lay his hands on it , thus tying the plot to the sub-plot , and making for a very entertaining endeavor . The space battles are extremely well done . The effects are startlingly good , even by today's standards , and the effects of Genesis inside the Genesis Cave , are absolutely brilliant . The new characters ; IE : Savik , a Vulcan addition to the crew of the Enterprise creatively and beautifully portrayed by Kirstie Alley ; Dr . Carol Marcus and her son ; are very well developed without creating long , slow scenes in which to accomplish the task . There is one slow scene in the entire movie , and that comes just before we get to see the Genesis Effect inside the Cave . This is the infamous movie in which Spock gives up his life to save the ship and his friends . I remember picket lines outside Paramount Studios for weeks after this movie was released , protesting Leonard Nimoy's retirement from the series in such a manner . All in all , of the movies in which the original cast stars , I would have to say it is a toss up between 2 , 4 , & 6 for the title of " Best " of these movies . I do not believe I could choose a favorite among those three . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
Almost as good as the original !	While this movie was not quite the same brilliant combination of effects , cast , characters and magic Spielberg delivered in the first production , I still found this sequel just as enjoyable as the first . The cast members are just as professional , and while they did not have the same original cast ( a mistake most sequels make ) , Dr . Ian Malcolm ( Jeff Goldblum ) does return . That was fine by me . He as my favorite character from the first movie , anyway . Joined byJulianne Moore as Dr . Sarah Harding and Vanessa Lee Chester who brilliantly portrayed Malcolm's daughter , Kelly , they attempt to recreate the magic of " Jurassic Park . " While they did not quite succeed in accomplishing the totality of the first , they did present the world with an excellent finished product which I found extremely fun to watch and highly entertaining . Plot : John Hammond is at it again , but this time , he is on the side of the environmentalist . InGen has been taken out of his control and he must stop his nephew from exploiting the dinosaurs kept as breeding stock for a possible second attempt at Jurassic Park's opening . Hammond already has a team on the island to observe and ensure that his nephew does not interfere with the island's inhabitants ; ie : the dinosaurs created by Hammond and the InGen team of genetic scientists . During the course of his conversation with Dr . Malcolm , whose reputation is now ruined because of the controversy behind his tales of the disastrous trek to Isla Nebular , Hammond discloses that the new team is not on Isla Nebular , but on a secret island developed as " Site B , " called Isla Sorna which is 87 miles south of the original site . Naturally , Malcolm refuses to go ( who wouldn't ! ) and is on his way out when Hammond reveals that Malcolm's girlfriend , Dr . Sarah Harding , is already on the island as part of the research team . " This is no longer a research mission . It's a rescue mission , and it's leaving right NOW ! " Dr . Ian Malcolm . The dinosaurs were done just as wonderfully in this fine sequel , as in the original ; the dialogue was just as witty and clever ; the characters were just as believable and well developed ; and you honestly did not have to be witness to the first movie to fully enjoy this one . The only things that were lacking , for me , were ( 1 ) the wonderful cinematography ; those excellent landscapes which were prevalent in the first . This one felt more deliberate ; less spontaneous , than its predecessor . That was due to ( 2 ) one badly-developed , poorly portrayed character , and unfortunately , he was one of the leading characters in the script . Arliss Howard as Peter Ludlow , John Hammond's egocentric nephew . I am unsure as to whether his acting quality was trite and stiff , or his character was written that way , but whatever it was , it did disrupt the quality of the movie , in my opinion . These two things combined , lowers my opinion of the movie , but only in comparison to the original , and only a little bit . This is still a very good sequel which stands alone without depending on the first plot to carry it . It earns an from . . . the Fiend : .
Existential Commentary On Life Is Beautiful All Around	This work is less about Steve Martin's character Davis , than it is about Kline ( Mack ) and Glover ( Simon ) , and Kline and McDonnell ( Claire ) , but the dialog inserted via Davis is pondering , contemplative , near-poetic existentialism at its best . He is witty , intelligent , and thoughtful in both dialog delivery and content . The writers deserved an Oscar . The performances are easy , relaxed , and natural ; just what you would expect from " A List " actors . Martin contributes the performance which leads into his more recent Shopgirl , guiding you through life , love , and the pursuit of wisdom if not happiness . Kline is the straight - the suit - the conformist of the film , and as such his performance is crisp and refreshing . This work deals with life in all aspects . It engenders a true emotional investment in its characters , and leaves you feeling hopeful that Mankind is not doomed , after all , no matter WHAT you believe , deep down . All in all ? This is delightful , with a gritty moment or two , and easy natural dialog which draws you in , assisting its audience in gaining a high enjoyment from this work . It's definitely worth your time , though it may not be every one's top choice as Friday / Saturday night entertainment . I really enjoyed the intelligence this exhibited . It's not typical , and was an unexpected surprise . Another wonderful surprise was the honesty exhibited herein . The couples and friends hold detailed conversations , which feel and sound fully honest and ( again ) natural . I was very impressed with this work , and will be adding it to the DVD collection soon . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
Sweet , Timess Classic	This Disney animated classic sure does live up to the term , " classic . " The characters here are well conceived , presented , and executed , as is the storyline , the premise , the tale , and the animation . This is among the oldest of Disney's animated feature-length films , and in my opinion , the older ones are the better ones . The animation quality is superior to the techniques used today , as are the scores . Cinderella is a personal favorite of mine , as it teaches you to hold onto your dreams , to ACT on them , and to have faith in yourself . This is beautiful , and definitely belongs in your Disney collection . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
Clearly the Best . . . and Hopefully the End	When it comes to Spider-man , Raimi clearly knows his business ! I was a bit apprehensive when I saw the black suit . I already knew that the Green Goblin 2 would be involved , there was the back story and sub-plotted love triangle romance between Parker , MJ , and Osborne , Sandman was cast , and the black Spidey-suit clearly indicated the Venom storyline ( a fact highly debated here on the IMDb boards , but I KNEW ; ) ) Subsequently , I was afraid Sam was going to try to do too much with this film . My worry was for naught . This movie skillfully meshes the complete , intricately woven web of intrigue , suspense , action , drama , and romance into one beautiful gossamer masterpiece , with the exception of the dysfunctional relationship element . I know much of the lure to Spiderman is that he is a regular guy who makes mistakes in the relationship department , can't hold a job , has an awkward relationship with his only living relative , and makes other mistakes too many to mention , but the dysfunctional aspects were too heightened here to garner appreciation and sympathy towards the lead character . In fact , they were a put off to this work . There IS one other aspect I can't say I loved : The CGI treatment was discernible . I think when CGI is prolifically used , it should be used well , and not be blatantly obvious to the untrained eye . In several places in this film , it was just that . . . not used well , and blatantly obvious to anyone looking . . . but again , it was only in places . It wasn't enough to bring down the whole movie . It DID serve to distract , however . I won't detail the plot as so many have done . Suffice it to say that this was the perfect ending to this franchise . End it now , before it can suffer franchise sickness and bad installments . This was pure perfection . Let's leave it to graze majestically . There has been some buzz around Hollywood concerning Spider-man 4 . Frankly , this movie closes all the necessary gaps and winds things up in a satisfactory conclusion . I see no reason to continue this franchise . End it on a high note , and let it go in glory . Please . But , Raimi seems to have moved on to other projects . He has recently sold a M4TV movie idea to Terry Goodkind , concerning his widely popular series , " The Sword of Truth Novels , " namely " Wizard's First Rule . " And , if the rumors are true , Raimi has been approached by New Line's Bob Shaye concerning direction of the impending Peter Jacksonless Hobbit endeavor . Let's hope Raimi has the sense to pass on that one ! Half the world would hate him ! At least , Jackson fans would , and that equates many , many movie-goers to boycott that work .

Bad timing for an otherwise worthy endeavor .	The timing was all wrong for a movie of this kind ; otherwise , it would have been a good endeavor . I really don't know how anyone else feels , but in the days of trials and tribulations , when hundreds of thousands of Americans have no idea from month to month if their children , husbands and wives , mothers and fathers on middle eastern soil are dead or alive , this was the wrong time to release an Iranian-sympathetic movie with an American police officer and a displaced homemaker as the " bad guys . " It struck a nerve with me , and I'm sure the same can be said by other millions who were not flocking to see this movie . With an estimated $16M-US budget and a $45 . 6K-US opening weekend , this movie has just barely come below its estimated budget at a $13M-US total return . That is not a fair estimation of this movie's power , as those who HAVE seen it have it rated at a decent 7 . 6 here at IMDb and , in fact , it IS well done . This work is powerful and compelling . It certainly isn't the fault of the movie itself that the subject matter is a poor choice for this time in American lives . I would be willing to bet that Sadowsky will more closely screen her projects from this attempt , on . As executive producer , it was her job to see that this movie was released in a more middle-eastern sympathetic time than tumultuous 2003 . It is a real tragedy , as this was a highly provocative endeavor which passes all the tests . You have characters with which you can sympathize ( on both sides of the equation ) , you have good direction , a rousing and eerily delivered score , good dialog , and a good story . Just horrible timing of its release . As I said , this should have waited several years for a more well received release . This is possibly some of Jennifer Connelly's best work . She delivers a very strong performance ; unfortunately , practically no one has seen it . And I have to say that Shohreh Aghdashloo gave a solid performance as the wife of the man you wanted to hate , but couldn't . Very nice ! I am curious as to where her career leads her . All in all this one rates an from . . . the Fiend : .
Melancholy tale of life , love and fantasy .	I highly recommend the " Ultimate " edition of this movie on DVD . The director's cut is par excellence ! The re-added scenes , the restored footage , the creative soundtrack was WAY worth the money spent . This is a tale of balance : darkness / light , love / hate , good / evil . What is also is ; however , is a marvelously Ridley Scott-ian directed dark fantasy . This movie is almost 20 years old , so I won't bother with the storyline / plot here , but if you like fantasy ; ie : unicorns , elves , goblins , and the like , you will LOVE this movie . The direction is beautiful , the cinematography and filmography are wonderful , the acting is convincing and the portrayals are rich . The character development is deep and well done and the extended DVD version is absolutely the BEST . I couldn't believe my eyes when we first plugged it in . Amazing . Simply amazing . A most excellent movie ! ! I also wanted to add that this is by far one of the best Tim Curry movies . He plays the Prince of Darkness in a most convincing portrayal . The effects just KICK in this movie . From the unicorns to the goblins , everything looks dead ON . I have always loved this movie , but the DVD Ultimate edition is just that ; ULTIMATE . You get all that is promised ( for once ) in this edition . As a fan of the movie , I am more than satisfied with this version . I literally could not believe what all had been left out of the original ! ! In this edition , there are no slow spots , no wasted film whatsoever . It's simply a marvelous fantasy , through and through . If you liked " The Dark Crystal , " " Willow , " " The Last Unicorn , " " Leprechauns , " " Addams Family , " or " Labyrinth , " check out " Legend : the Ultimate Edition .

Withstands the tests of time .	I recently purchased Blazing Saddles on DVD , to replace my well used and abused VHS copy . I was amazed at how funny this movie still IS . Although I've never found humor in flatulence , that scene is a classic ; the bad guys all sitting around the campfire , eating beans and ripping loud ones while Taggart ( Slim Pickens ) attempts to contrive a new scheme for ridding them of the new Sheriff of Rock Ridge . " Well , what about Mongo ? " I always felt uncomfortable with the use of racial slurs , and this movie made me uncomfortable in that way , but it was Mel Brooks's intent to make us uncomfortable with racism . You can't correct a problem until you drag it out and lay it on the table , which is precisely what he did . He left no stone unturned , and even took a few pot shots at himself in the process . This movie should have won about a hundred awards for its edge , wit , boldness , and the wonderful performances brought to the mix by these veteran actors . While Madeline Kahn did win a nomination for her portrayal as Lily von Shtupp , she should have won . . and won . . and won . That is my favorite scene in the entire movie . Gene Wilder is brilliant as the " Deputy Spade . " While he was a bit young to be cast as a washed-up gunslinger , he molds himself into the role very quickly and lends a strong endearing presence to his character . Endearing is a good word . It fits Clevon Little's character , as well . He was honorable , clever , and completely smooth as the Sheriff of Rock Ridge . I highly admired his performance , and still do . The dark humor in this movie is astounding . Brooks leaves no ethnic group unscathed by his cutting wit . There is no wonder this is the top grossing western attempt to be put on film . In the 1970's , when this was first released , America needed this form of release . There were serious racial tensions throughout the country , Watergate was still ringing in our ears , and the drama that was Patty Hurst's life for a time was still very much front page news . We , as a nation , needed a diversion which was not afraid of controversy and harsh reviews . The box office gross demonstrated just how much we DID need this movie , at the time it came out . For that ; being there for us when we needed it most , many thousands , if not millions , are loyal to Brooks and his productions , regardless of the subject matter . The laughter and lightheartedness he gave to us lives on . I was so pleased to see this movie redistributed on DVD . Now , another generation can see and enjoy it as much as we did . Though they may not understand how we could laugh at a bunch of idiotic rednecks singing slave songs , using the " N " word every other line , and comparing anyone with any level of culture to " a bunch of Kansas City fagots , " hopefully , the humor will not be lost to the misunderstanding that these slurs were meant to be taken seriously . The intent was to LAUGH AT those ignorant rednecks for BEING ignorant rednecks . Long live Mel Brooks , the Crowned Prince of Parody ! ! It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
Wonderfully " dark " sci-fi / horror .	While this was based on Metropolis , this attempt is - much - more entertaining . This is also probably Jennifer Connely's best attempts to date ( this is being written after the Hulk and House of Sand and Fog , by the way ) , and William Hurt's most interesting role . This story is a beautiful , mysterious , darkling tale of deceit , intrigue , and murder . Even after the secrets are discovered , the whole story is not told until the very end . This movie is an ultimate ride on the mind twister train . Just sit back , and remember to employ your thinking cap as you enjoy the ride . I will not spoil this movie , as many others have . I will let my rating of this movie speak for itself . If you are a fan of dark tales , science-fiction , or psychological horror / thrillers , this is a definite must-see . It highlights stellar performances by Keifer Sutherland , William Hurt , Jennifer Connely , and Rufus Sewell ( Lord Adamar from A Knight's Tale ) . I highly recommend the Platinum Series Collection edition which includes the Widescreen and Fullscreen versions , commentaries by film critic Roger Ebert , another by the Director , writers , DoP and production designer , the Find Shell Beach interactive Game , Cast and crew biographies , filmographies and Star Highlights , Comparisons to Fritz Lang's Metropolis , Theatrical Trailer , Set Designs and fully animated menus .
