Easily one of the years worst	First off is this a horror film or dark comedy ? I don't know . Its neither scary nor funny , although it seems to be trying to be both . Second not a whole hell of a lot happens . They drive and talk ; stand and talk ; drive and talk ; talk to a woman with her baby ; talk and talk and talk and talk and talk . None of it is very good , and its only made worse by bad direction . Its awful . Nothing happens . Its a giant cheap mess , with the same driving footage used over and over and over again . Its people talking saying really dumb stuff but not doing anything . Well , in actually stuff does happen , but nothing interesting and nothing that makes sense even with the sting in the tail ending . ( SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER - Worse the sting doesn't take into account that one of the characters could not have seen a good chunk of the events . END SPOILER ) While I commend the lack of big splash effects , the direction and writing make their lack of use seem more like ineptness and penny pinching . . Avoid this unless you really need to see every horror movie ever made .
Home movie	Early Joe Sarno film is little more than a home movie . I think even fans of his later films are going to be hard pressed to sit through this mess of a movie concerning strippers , voodoo and god know what else . To be honest I watched about twenty minutes of this before it became too much and I ended up watching the rest on fast forward , I can sit through most anything but this was an endurance test . Many scenes have little or no dialog , action is often crammed into the corner of a room with some sort of attempt at a set jammed with the cast ( as if they were trying to make a living room look like a malt shop ) . There are longing looks and sense that there is a meaning floating just off the edge of the screen which neither we nor the cast can find . Truth be told this is a movie that you should not attempt to find just let remain lost .
Jaw droppingly bad . . . and weird . . . and strange . . . and just bad . . . in a funny sort of way	There is a point where one sees things that one can't watch because its so hysterically funny one will die from laughter from continued viewing . There is a point where on realizes that those who have deemed Ed Wood and his films the worst ever made never looked hard enough . ( anyone who starts down the road of bad movies is aware of this almost instantly - but I digress ) There are times when you watch a movie you can feel your brain being cut up as it claws in desperation to get out of your head . Occasionally people can actually release their home movies to theaters and have people pay to see them . Psyched by the 4d Witch is a prime example of all of the above and more . . . you'll pray it isn't true but it is . . . This is a movie that is rated R , it even says so in the credits , because of nudity and sex . I think its because the film makers were desperate to have a reason for people to see this movie . This is a movie about Cindy who's a virgin and through the use of sexual witchcraft and the help of a dead ancestor who was a witch is able to have sex and remain a virgin . Oh yea baby . There is no dialog only voice over as Cindy and two other people relate the story to you over footage that is a combination someones vacation film and the sort of stuff that is worse than what I used to shoot in 8 mm , with the exception that my stuff never had a naked blonde in it . ( She's a babe ) Adding to it all is a whacked out sense of odd lights and bad Halloween decorations that make a first graders haunted house seem scary . Words fail me . The film opens with a woman dancing to the theme song in a style similar to the James Bond films , only worse . Its a moment that makes you say " WTF ? " even if you don't use profanity you will as you see this . After the opening credits we get film of someones trip to a college inter-cut with a naked girl practicing witchcraft . I know this is what she's doing because of the voice over . Then we get weird lights and masks and you end up on the floor convulsed from laughter wondering how in the hell this ever got released . The Something Weird website said its from a rare 35mm print , my guess is its the only one in existence . I would hate to think that this was actually inflicted on enough paying customers that they needed more than one print or that it actually had a run in several theaters ( hey , I bought this disc used ) This is a movie to be enshrined in infamy . This is bad film making as high art . This is get drunk and MST3K this sucker to death . ( The only reason it wasn't on the show was that its too easy to make fun of , besides its the movie that probably would have broken the boys ) DO NOT TAKE DRUGS WHILE WATCHING THIS FILM . Consumption of mind altering drugs will only result in the movie making sense , and where's the fun in that . This is beyond bad and twice as jaw dropping . Ed Wood could only aspire to be this awful . Gay necrophilia vampirism with bad teeth are the words of the day . If you like to see bad . mind altering movies see this . . . If you want to laugh at a truly ( and I mean that ) awful film see this . This is below the bottom of the barrel at its worst .
One of the worst	Woman who may or may not be crazy has dreams about a demon called the nightmare man . It takes its form from a fertility mask and when she's left alone by her husband when they run out of gas the demon comes after her and chases her to a house in the woods . Awful just really awful . This was part of the after dark horror festival for this year and I'm shocked . Somewhere a while back I thought I saw on TV or in a horror fest or something ( months and months and months ago ) and I started it and hated it or at least disliked it enough to shut it off early on or walk out , this time unfortunately , as part of the After Dark festival , I suffered almost to the end . How this ended up in After Dark after that is beyond me . Its terrible . No one seems to be able to act which isn't entirely the casts fault since the direction is pretty poor . This reminded me of some really dreadful horror films from the early 1980's and late 1970's as the drive in films were dying . I'm talking films where Lawanda Paige was comic relief and big breasted " stars " took off their tops . You know a movie is bad when all I can say nice about it is that the women look good and some of them disrobe . I hope I never sit through this a third time .
Mad mess of a movie that shoots itself in the foot by badly blending comedy and horror . Only notable as Lionel Atwill's last leading role	Lionel Atwill plays Br Benson a scientist experimenting with suspended animation . Atwill has found a way of putting animals in to suspended animation , then curing their disease and then bringing them back to life . Unfortunately when he tries to move to people the good doctor finds that he can not revive his subjects thus provoking the police to look for the murderer . Fleeing he boards a ship and heads for the south seas . When the ship catches fire , Atwill and several other survivors end up on an island where Atwill uses his medical tricks to enslave the natives . B movie or not this is a mess of a movie . The film starts okay , with Atwill trying his experiment on a man trying to get money for his family . The police burst in and he's forced to flee . After that comedy sets in and the film doesn't know what it wants to be . Once the ship sinks and the survivors end up on the island things become a mixed bag . Its it suppose to be serious or a comedy ? First billed Una Merkel makes me think it was a comedy . Merkel as a crazy woman going to New Zealand for the fifth time to find love would usually be in the background to Atwill's craziness , but here she's often front and center . The problem is that the comedy is very heavy handed and not very funny . As a drama it isn't much better . Its natives in sarongs bowing before the mad Atwill , who looks bored and distracted . It reminded me of some of the dreadful jungle monster pictures from the 1950's where the mad scientist goes to the jungle and sets some creature loose like in From Hell it Came , except those movies were fun . I don't think that it helps that this film has something resembling a budget . Certainly the use of stock footage helped , but the fact that Universal spent probably twice what something like Republic , Monogram or a Poverty Row studio made me think that this would be something more than a really cheesy film . I know the reasonable look of the film made it hard to forgive the dopey script . To be honest this is a hard film to really discuss . Its a light weight B movie that is not bad enough to make one want to spend time commenting on it . Its a bad movie that makes you want to forget it after you've seen it , with a " well that was a waste of an hour " before moving on to something else . Its a misfire and not worth saying anything bad about simply because the movie inflicts enough damage on itself . Not worth bothering with except as a footnote in Lionel Atwill's career , his last starring role , and possibly his worst performance .
Bad	Owner of a failing jewelry store , who also happens to be an ex thief decides to give it ago one more time to save himself . A cut or two above the amateur ranks this film isn't very good with our hero seeming to sit brooding in every other scene and the people around him often playing to the camera . Its as if no one had been on camera before , or worse no one had any idea how to really convey emotions . You never believe any of it for an instant . There is no sense of anything other than lets play dress up . I have no idea how this film got released to DVD , except that there is no underestimating the ability for people to try bad movies , I mean even I picked it up .
I'm seemingly in the minority , I really don't like this movie	Sasha Cohen pretends to be a reporter visiting America and makes fun of people in the process . I understand the humor . I get the jokes . I just don't find them funny . Yes I'm in that seemingly small group of people who don't find Borat funny , or even particularly clever . No , I'm not a fan of Ali G , one of Cohen's other characters and who's show was the source of the Borat character . Forgive me the jokes aren't all that clever , it seems his jokes are low rent Monty Python malapropisms or jokes so stupid I doubt most cut rate vaudevillians wouldn't have touched them . Am I bothered by Cohen using these seemingly innocent as foils ? partly because they were set up to look stupid and didn't fall into their own trap , then again my feelings are mitigated by the fact I can't believe that no one caught on ( of course if they did we wouldn't see that ) . I am bothered by his " I'm so much cleverer than you attitude that pervades the film . Clearly he's amused by the joke he's telling which is all that matters . I sat there stone faced for 80 minutes .
Another Steve Reeves Clunker	Reeves plays Haji Murad , a hero in 1850's Russia . This is a badly dubbed movie , with June Foray doing some of the voices . Unfortunately who ever was suppose to sync the voices to the lips was blind since the words never match the lip flaps . Anyone who says that Japanese films are bad have never watched this film . The film's plot is instantly forgettable and so I've forgotten it in the time its taken the movie to end and for me to sit and write this down . Perhaps it has more to do with the fact that the film is one of the many that Reeves made in hopes of moving away from action to more plot driven sort of films . It may have been a good thing for Reeves , but its deadly for the audience who have to slug through nooze fests such as this , where its all court intrigue with very little action . In Reeves defense , he was a good actor , he just had no real luck in picking films that were any good . They all looked great , but very few of them didn't put the those watching them into a coma for the film's running time . This film will put you in a coma . Watch it only if you have the need for sleep and all other gentler means have failed .
Wasted talent	This is what happens when creative people think they can do anything and it will work . Its also what happens when " hot " celebrities are allowed to make a joke thats nothing but a self serving in joke . This is a bunch of stories , by different directors none of which is very good . Trying to figure out which segment is better is sort of like trying to figure out which pile of garbage is the best . If you've never heard of this film , I'm not surprised since the film was barely released to theaters . It almost never plays on TV , so unless you've sought it out , something I can't recommend , you've never seen it . Ultimately , other than for money the only reason I can think this was made was so that the directors would know that they never could make a worse film .
No , I didn't like this nor do I think you should see it	I really don't like this movie . I had been warned away from it by numerous friends who despised it and hailed it as one of the worst films in years , and yet I still went to see it , stupid me . While I don't think its one of the worst films ever made I do think its a really big mess . The plot has Orlando Bloom designing a shoe which looses his company something close to a billion dollars . ( This is so ludicrous that I was lost to the film at this point . I can't conceive of anything happening on this scale with out market testing and research . It , like most of the plot doesn't work ) Bloom decides to go home and kill himself , but before he can do so he gets a call that his father has died and that he has to rush home and handle the arrangements . Putting off his pain he rushes off to help his family meeting Kirsten Dunst in the process . Well acted and with some very good turns of phrase , this film is a complete disaster plot-wise . Things are so bizarre as to be neither quirky , nor believable . As I said the whole shoe thing is stupid , as is his means of suicide , and the motivations of a good number of the characters . What planet are these people from ? I don't know . I couldn't connect with any of them , although I do wish I could come up with some of their pithy lines . Frankly this is another of the recent run of films by big name film makers that make you wonder if their entire out put should be reviewed and re-evaluated in light of their current " film " . Not worth seeing . Or if you must see it wait for cable .
The music is great , the rest less so	Spoof of every music biography you can think of with John C Reilly in the lead a Dewey Cox , a Johnny Cash style singer . Amusing , but only to a point , this is movie that sets up a joke and unleashes it then sets up another joke and unleashes it and then another and another one at a time in succession as it hits every movie music bio cliché there is . As game as the cast is I could find no reason to keep watching this film , except that the songs are excellent . Frankly if it wasn't for the songs I'd say pass on this film until cable since the jokes are too few and often too obvious to bother with besides buying the cd of music would be cheaper and jump you right to the good stuff .
20 minute story stretched to 90 minutes for no real reason	Noisy and very busy story about the shooting of the president in Spain as seen by numerous vantage points . There has to be a better way to tell this story . . . A grand misdirection of a not particularly good sort this film is so frenetic as to make one almost ill . Its the same events done over in rapid succession and it gets tiring and boring very fast . Part of the problem is that once the events play through they take things to a certain point and then fade out on a cliff hanger then rewind from a new point of view . this would be okay except that the events aren't all that interesting . Lets face it they've stretched a twenty minute short to 90 minutes by replaying it again and again . Its also not the sort of tale that needs to be told like this , there is no Rashomon like tale here , its an assassination and thats all . We get very little character development because we're in a tiny time frame so you don't really care . And whats worse the film cheats in a couple of places-things are never quite the same and some people see things they really shouldn't have . I suppose if you don't think and are undemanding its a fun ride , however for me I was bored silly by the middle of the second go round . 3 .
The obnoxiousness of the lead character makes this tough to get through	Obnoxious Eva Longoria dies on her wedding day when an ice sculpture of an angel ( without wings ) falls on her off the back of a truck and kills her . She is then tries to ruin the relationship of her ex-boyfriend with his new girlfriend , a psychic who can see her . Obvious unoriginal movie wouldn't be bad in a clichéd sort of way , except that Longoria's character is hateful and obnoxious that she drains all of the fun out of the film . Its like having your ears cleaned with sandpaper . To be fair Longoria , nor anyone else in the cast or crew , isn't the problem , its the god awful script that sinks the proceedings . Its just really really stupid .
See it in big screen 3D or not at all	Wildly uneven on every level retelling of the " classic " poem . I saw this first in 2D and the following week in 3D . I really hated it in 2D I liked it more in 3D If you must see this see it in 3D . The action set pieces , 3 battles with Grendel , the sea monsters and the dragon castle attack are spectacular ( though the Grendel attacks are kind of dull ) . The 3D viewing will explain why you have a constant moving of the camera-endless tracking shots that serve no real purpose except make you go " ooo and ah " in 3D . It will also explain why you have these really bad perspective shots like a sentry's lance in your face . The 50's and 80's 3D craze had some odd shots but nothing as awkward ( in 2D ) as those in this film . The script is uneven . There are lots of moments of hysterical satire and hysterically bad lines of dialog ( this is a movie you can laugh at and with ) . When the film isn't in motion the film often stalls in long long winded scenes of dialog that are just plain awful . ( And yes it is possible to know what Neil Gaiman wrote , especially if you've read his paycheck comics and watched his earlier film adventures ) . Clearly the script was suppose to be a joke , but Zemekis didn't seem to notice and filmed it straight removing much of the humor along the way . And thats the problem . Zemekis insistence on doing this as motion capture because " it would cost too much as a live action film " is what ruins the subtleties the script might have had ( and is pure horse hockey since all monster and action stuff would have been CGI anyway ) . First off the most of the character animation sucks . The characters are pasty faced non-emotive automatons that go threw the motions . I felt I was watching the road company of the background characters from Shrek 3 . The technique pretty much prevents any sort of real performance with the exception of Ray Winstone and Anthony Hopkins . ( John Malkovich gives a performance but its so bizarre as to classified as a knowing joke ) . Robin Wright Penn's character-vital to the story - is so stiff ( in every sense of the word ) that it looks embalmed . The animation is often worse than any big budget computer game , and worse than whats coming out of Japan or out of many film studios effect houses . Another major problem ( especially in 2D where the visuals don't distract you from the many flaws ) is the damned choral score which is repetitive to the point of making you want to commit suicide . Its ten times worse than any video game ear worm you've ever heard and been scared by . There are some great sequences as I said . the action scenes are spectacular with Beowulf's sea battle and dragon battle being the very very bloody highlights . They are the reasons the film might have a life on DVD and cable , since flat or 3D they are way cool . Two other points I think I should mention . First clearly there is something wrong when this film is PG13 and Tekkonkinkreet is R . Grendel is far more bloody and sexually ( both straight and gay ) in your face that the animated film from Japan . If you want to see the effect of a big studio on the ratings board this is it . Honestly many " bloody " horror films don't have this much blood . The fights in this film are bloody and disgusting and make you wonder about the ratings board . ( This is a really really bloody movie ) Secondly anyone else but me feel that Grendel is throw back to the old days where mentally or physically handicapped people were to be locked up in the attic and feared because they were different ? Come on strip away the monstrous size and fact that by the time we meet him , Grendel has gone insane from being locked in a cave , he is a " special needs " child gone bad . Its sad . When I saw this is 3D I was less critical because of the visual effects but it still didn't make it really a batter film , just one where the flash hides the flaws . So as a 3D film the effects will make the action scenes enough of a thrill ride to get past the deadly slow talky bits-so it 6 out 10 as 3D As a 2D film where nothing is in your face and it all looks odd 3 to , with a couple of great action scenes that are great regardless of flat or multi dimensional . Unfortunately the talky bits make it very tough going with out the gee whiz of the 3D . Lastly , this and the 3D process are being hailed by some as the future of movies ; If this is the future of movies we all deserve to go blind .
Film made in a blender is a real mess	Quest For Fire Meets Apocolypto meets Stargate meets the Lost World Cliché ridden blender created tale of an ancient hunter tribe being over run by a more advanced society and dragged off to make " the pyramids " . Give ' em points for having a dark skinned cast in an African setting , take points away for silliness and historical inaccuracy . Let me just say the problems with the film begin with every creature being several times than it was in real life continue on with wildly uneven visual effects and moves from there . Forget the illogic of the plotting-why would the bad guys travel so far ? - This movie is a total mess so much so that its neither fun nor interesting . And I have to ask-did they really think that the Sid Haig-esquire villain was actually not going to push this film into the trash bin ?
Atmospheric horror story is too talky for the first hour before heating up for the final thirty minutes	This film made me nod off to sleep . Despite decent film making , some good atmosphere this film just put me out . The problem is that for the better part of an hour nothing really happens . A diverse group of people keep crossing and recrossing each others paths before they end up in a weird mansion in the fog . At that point there is a great deal of talk before the bodies start to pile up and ghosts begin to appear . What exactly is going on I'll leave for you to discover since once things get moving the movie isn't that bad . ( Actually it isn't bad its just badly paced ) Is this worth seeing ? Its worth a shot , especially if you can get it as part of a multi movie pack or on cable , I wouldn't pay money to rent or purchase just this movie since its not that good .
Aliens invade a small bayou town in a not very good film that has only the monsters and some sick humor to recommend it	Loser stuntman shows up at a Beef Pie Festival to jump 40 oil cans and falls in love with the organizers daughter . When the stunt goes wrong he's sent away for 130 years . Breaking out of prison he heads back to his lady love , just in time for the next Festival and an alien invasion . Quirky and one of a kind , this riff on the sort of films that started Peter Jackson on his road to the Oscars is a love it or hate it proposition . I damn near hate the film . No where near as good as anything Jackson ever turned out , its a game attempt at something different but falls as flat as road kill . Its odd and off beat for no real reason other than to be odd and off beat ( all of the characters are " characters " and have little connection to reality ) . At times fitfully funny , often in a cruel way , this film just seems to just want to break taboos and be strange . There are numerous musical sequences , which while fine seem to go on too long . Worse I really didn't like anyone . The real reason to see the film is the aliens . Mostly seen as floating blips with tentacles , these are lean mean killing machines . Heads fly , blood splatters and bad jokes are cracked ( I liked the conversation about how one victims face was sucked off ) . These are wild and wanton beasties and are almost worth the price of a rental . Unfortunately they really don't show up until the last half hour , by which point you may have turned off the movie and put on a Golden Girls rerun . I can't recommend this film to anyone except tolerant gore hounds and monster lovers who are advised to keep the remote handy for frequent fast forwarding . Everyone else is advised to rent a Peter Jackson film instead . for the monsters and a few cruel jokes that work
Weakest of the Val Lewton " classics "	Richard Dix is the mad captain in one of the series of horror films that Val Lewton produced . Difficult , if not impossible to see ( I purchased several other films over the years trying to get this ) it was recently released on DVD as part of a box set of the Lewton horror films ( soon to be released with a new documentary ) . The plot has a junior officer realizing that the Captain is mad and then having to do something about it . As one of my Holy Grail films over the years I've always wanted to see it . I picked up the box set and then sat down to watch it on a number of occasions and I was always called away . A warning ? I hope not , but I do know that now having finally see the film I find it absolutely terrible . There is no atmosphere and no sense of terror . Its a movie and a pretty bad one at that . I'm partly blaming the director Mark Robson , who worked with Lewton on other films in the series ( 7th victim , Isle of the Dead and Bedlam ) which were quite good . I'm also Blaming Russell Wade as Tom our hero . He looks the part but is so wishy washy and ineffectual that its no wonder that he made over 50 movies prior to this most of which he was not credited for . He's so bad that you can't imagine him standing up to anyone for anything . He wrecks what could have at least been an okay movie . A bust .
Cruel and nasty " kids " film may induce nightmare	Stephen ( Shoalin Soccer , Kung Fu Hustle ) Chow's cruel edged children's film . Stephen Chow is a coolie who works on construction jobs to puts his son into a posh school in order to give him opportunities . Chow's son is still despised because they are so poor they have to make due with thrown away things like sneakers and dirty clothes . One day while out trying to scavenge a pair of sneakers Chow stumbles upon what he thinks is a bouncy ball but which is really an alien that looks like a chia pet crossed with day glow slime . The alien is named CJ7 and he complicates everyones lives-though not in the way you think . Stephen Chow's films often have a cruel edge , however there tends to be a cartoony nature to the story that softens it . The edge is in full force as Chow torments his lead characters as they endure the brick bats of the haves and of life . The abuse is not only verbal but decidedly physical as the boy is beaten up by bullies and has to suffer other indignities . Let me put it this way Chow even has his son's character covered in poop . Yea the poop joke is funny at first but Chow pushes it too far and it just becomes uncomfortable , which is how many of the jokes end . I think humor works better if the characters deserve to be abused , these characters don't . What did Chow and his son do to deserve the abuse ? nothing but be too poor for words . ( And even in the end what ever they overcome and win is not matched by what they had to get there , its ugly ) Its as if all Chow knew was cruelty jokes and he started there and let everything else slip away . I'm all for not coddling kids with " safe " jokes , but there is a nastiness here that I wouldn't want my kids to see . . . . . . actually I don't think anyone should see it , not just because it ugly , but because this movie isn't very good . The jokes and the gags more often then not fall flat . ( most of ) The punchlines are obvious and the jokes are often tired ( kids special pet gives him super abilities is tired , even if there is a twist ) . The direction seems weak and where there was a snap to Chow's earlier film things are just too flaccid . Perhaps the cast of kids wasn't up to it , or perhaps director / writer Chow wasn't sure what he was doing . To be certain the adults in the story are almost nonentities , which is odd since you would have thought that Chow the writer director would have given himself some sort of a character to play , he's just a stoic dad trying to do what he can for his kid . There is nothing . To be honest Chow has badly constructed a plot which doesn't flow , it lurches from thing to thing . Its as if he had a series of set pieces but nothing but thin threads to connect them . There are a few things that work mostly to do with CJ7 . There are several times when the little special effect steals the show like when it shows the emotions the various kids shout out ( You're family is killed , you get 100 on a test ) or how it rolls down a car window , when it constructs super items . Its pure silliness . And as much as I'm bitching I also like that Chow doesn't play down to the kids and sweeten the lives of our main characters , but I just wish he didn't make its so cruel and bleak , I mean there is a moment when things seem to turn around for our leads when something truly nasty happens . Its all " okay " in the end , but even that has a price ( not to mention it will probably instill nightmares in many children ) . Its not a horrible movie , but its close to a horrifying one , especially if you want to protect you kids from unpleasantness . I'd rather show my kids Shaolin Soccer or Kung Fu Hustle . I could be over reacting and the film just sort of caught me in an odd way , but I suggest to watch this alone before you let your kids see it . Though if I was given a choice I'd watch Disney's Secret of the Magic Gord - which is similar to this film and deserving of a release outside of Asia .
Just okay film probably would play best at a drive-in with a second car chase feature	A man on parole , in love with his bosses married daughter , robs a bank and then runs off to Mexico with the daughter in tow . If you've ever wondered what Southern drive-in fare was like in the early 1970's , look no farther . This is the sort of low budget movie that played all along the South during the boom days of the drive-in movie theater . My guess this would have been the second or third feature of a multi feature program . While this is not the best movie in the world ( an understatement ) it does have a certain nostalgic charm , at least for me . I like the fact that Dub Taylor , a character actor who's work goes all the way back to the Frank Capra movies of the 1930's is allowed to play something close to a lead . The movie itself is just okay , but its clearly a film that never could stand on its own except as a filler on a multi feature program . Is it worth seeing ? As a stand alone feature probably not , but if you're going to have a night of movies you might want to throw this one into the mix , especially if you're doing an evening of country themed drive-in movies .
A rigidly stiff cast make this tough going .	Michael Rennie stars as a block of wood . . . er as a stoic member of the Polish Resistance who along with a compatriot get themselves captured with the hopes of getting sent to a German labor camp where they can spy on the new wonder weapon the V-1 . Based on a true story and supposedly close to what actually happened , which usually keeps things lively , this was a tough go through for me . The problem was that the performances are very stiff . Michael Rennie's performance seemed to consist of standing rigidly and looking something like concerned . Most of his fellow actors were similar in what I can only describe as statue like performances . I'm forced to wonder if the stiffness was due to a limited wardrobe budget since no one seems to get dirty or change their clothes . Its all very serious in life or death way , but at the same time some of the deep pronouncements sound very silly in a " we must soldier on " sort of way . Christopher Lee , despite having a relatively high billing , is in a couple of scenes as a Nazi camp officer . His performance is as animated as Rennie's is rigid making me wonder if he either thought this was a comedy , or was angry with the director and gave a bizarre reading of the role . ( Of course it could be simply that he had some life while the rest of the cast was blocks of wood . ) The story is a good one , but as told here its a long 80 minutes that makes you wonder why they bothered . Recommended for those times when you are in a forgiving mood and want a WW2 drama you haven't seen before .
Good Lemmy Caution entry is too knowing to fully enjoy	Eddie Constantine is Lemmy Caution in his second or third go round at the character . Here caution is on the trail of a women who may or may not be mixed up in a blackmail scheme . Its a semi-complicated affair that Lemmy solves more with his fists then his brains . Its an okay Euro Noir that is a bit too knowing for my tastes-Eddie and some of the other cast members pretty much look in the camera and wink . Constantine is a great actor and I could never understand why he never why he was never big here in the US . He was a fine tough guy that looked like he could do pretty much anything . To be certain he made films up to his death , but at the same time he should have been huge here in the US . Worth a look if you're in the mood-its perfect late night fare .
Frustrating sequel to a classic film - It should have been a radio play ( or had a better director )	( This is not an objective review but a personal rant about what might have been ) The plot of this movie follows the early days of Carlito , as he rises to power and prestige in the drug world . ( his later exploits were told in Brian DePalma's Carlito's Way ) This film disappointed me a great deal . Here's a reasonably well written movie that completely falls apart because the director can't make this film look like anything more than a mediocre direct to home video movie . He has decent actors and a decent script based on a good novel , but he is rudimentary in how he handles the shots . There is no feeling that the actors are doing any more than pretending because we are never drawn in to what was happening on screen . It looks fake . You never believe any of it . If you want to see how dumb the choices are you need look no further than the opening monologue where the tenuous position of the Porto Ricans is explained . We have a well read bit of dialog inter-cut , badly , with black and white footage and stills . When the script calls for some one to die we hear a gunshot with a clichéd close up of a gun firing that doesn't match the surrounding footage . Its so clichéd your mouth drops open because you can't believe some one would do something that dumb . But it shouldn't be like this . The script is actually quite good . . . Growing tired about a third of the way into the movie I began to close my eyes . As I listened to the film I suddenly began to like what I was hearing . I opened my eyes because I figured that the movie had gotten better , but I was instantly struck by how the script and the performances were being wounded by the visuals and directorial choices . He's a perfect case of a bad director turning fillet Mignon in to sloppy joes . If you liked the first movie you may want to try this , but I'd either do something else while watching , or turn off the TV and just listen to the sound through the sound system since it plays better as a radio play . for a good script and cast .
Meandering and unfocused	Based on a radio show this short ( an hour ) film is a bit of a meandering mess . the plot of the film has two gangs going to war and somehow in the middle of it all the daughter of an oil man is kidnapped . As the police try to solve the crime ( s ) , Cosmo Jones , a genius and amateur criminologist forces himself into the case . This is a weird film where the title character doesn't show up for a quarter of the running time . When he does show up he sort of seems as if he were added into the mix for no good reason , with a young police Sargent taking the lead . Its not until into the second half of the film that he takes center stage . Another weird twist is Mantan Moreland who is listed fourth in the credits as a " star " and he only shows up close to the half way mark in a role that requires him to do little more than stand around for most of his screen time ( I guess a pay check is a pay check ) . The problem is that the film wanders to and fro with out any real direction . Its starts off as a gangster story , shifts to the cops , shifts again to gang war film , turns again into a murder tale then swerves into the kidnap tale . Characters take center stage then fall to the background over and over again , not like in an ensemble film where there is ebb and flow , instead its like seeing a series of almost unconnected photographs . The result is a rather bland and un-involving movie , which is a shame since the film does have some genuinely good moments ( the near torture of Moreland is horrifying in a very real way ) and there are more than its share of funny lines . Not really worth seeking out , I'd pretty much let this one slide unless I ran across it on TV , in which case it would be worth taking a peak .
Great acting and great film making make for a creepy first half but a lack of direction ruins the second	Eco horror film about the advance team from an oil company finding that the Alaskan wilderness is turning against it . Ten years earlier a test well had been drilled and what it found was kept secret . Now after years of negotiations and behind the scenes dealing the advance group from Northern Industries is preparing the way for full scale drilling . Arriving back from headquarters big wig Ron Perlman finds things are beginning to go amiss . The temperature is climbing despite it being February , its raining and more than one of the people in his crew is acting strange . Well made and well acted this film works for about 45 minutes until one of the crew , who had gone mysteriously missing , begins to go on about strange forces and " don't you see it " . No we don't . And thats the problem . much of this film we don't see anything . To be certain we do see the guy wander into the waste and freeze to death and we see his lifeless corpse moved around , and we see the ominous animals , we see the deaths and we hear the scary words about the planet in revolt , but we don't see anything that makes sense . For whatever reason none of it makes a whole hell of a lot of sense . Its formless dread that never takes form , and while our lives are often controlled by it , you can't make a movie about it . To be honest I started not to pay attention in the last 35 or 40 minutes . The mood was good , but it just wasn't scary because the reason for the fear , other than clever film-making , was missing . I'll try it again down the road , but for now I consider it a misfire . ( Also in fairness a friend at work really really liked it )
Funny , but ugly Christmas comedy	I will admit that much of this film is funny . There genuine laughs in this film of a man renting a family for Christmas , but there is such a mean nasty edge to much of it that I wanted to take a bath after seeing it . I have no idea why this well made film is so ugly but it it is . The opening montage of Christmas scenes sets the tone with the joyous Christmas Season standbys counterpointed with shots of greed , anger and suicidal thoughts . Feel good its not . Ben Affleck's is a horrible person and gets no sympathy even as he tries to be good and be touchy feelly , he's still a horse's ass . And yet I laughed , and it bothered me . Its terrible to say that for probably the first time in my life I felt bad laughing at a comedy . I can't recommend this , but it is funny . because it is funny .
Suffering from lack of music which deadens the pace , this train based drama gains points for putting you in the cab . A must if you love trains	Young boy , named Jimmy , who idealizes Casey Jones is devastated when Jones is killed in a train wreck . On the eve of World War One Jimmy has grown up to be an engineer like his hero . However once war is declared Jimmy is forced to stay home since his mother is too sick to be left at home alone , leading many to think he was a coward . The feeling is increased when a train Jones is on looses pressure to the breaks . The fireman jumps from the train , Jimmy stays behind to fix the problem , but is thrown when the train crashes leading many to believe he jumped without giving warning . Worse Jimmy's girl leaves him . Will he be able to clear his name and gain the respect of everyone once more ? Mascot train based drama is a decent little film . Not the best nor the worst , the film gains a good many points from being filmed on location on the train yards and around the locomotives that are key to the story . Sure there are models , but they are only use fleetingly in the crash scenes . If there is any flaw its that the film is paced very slow . Like most Mascot films there is no music so things seem to unfold at a slower pace . The film also takes a good long time getting where its going , which is good for building characters but makes you want to move things along . Worth a look if you run across it ( especially if you like trains ) , but not something to search out or feel bad about missing .
Great action action sequences make the long travel footage worth enduring	When Ghostly Face ( a good guy who wears a monster mask ) kills a woman's father and steals his sword , she sets off for revenge . She is unaware that Ghostly Face isn't the killer , but has been set up a a band of pirates . Along the way the woman rescues a girl who was taken by the pirates and the pair set off together to find out whats really going on . Forgive me for being vague , but this is a hard film to rate ( and get through ) . There are incredibly long periods where nothing happens . For example a half an hour in we get a flash back that tells us the story of the rescued girl . It consists of a long sequence of Indonesian Theater and cock fighting . After about 15 minutes of beautiful travelogue footage the pirates break in and we get some action . Much of the film is like this , long sequences of travel footage that ends in a fight sequence . It completely kills the film , and prevents any real plot development . On the other hand , and its a a big other hand , the fight sequences are fantastic . They are bloody and spectacular and wonderfully comic book like as the lone woman warrior takes on thirty piratical bad guys . Much of the first half hour doesn't make a great deal of sense but its fun to watch . I loved half of this film - anything that involves the fights . I disliked the travel film footage that stops this movie dead in the water . If you like martial arts film this is certainly worth a rental . I'm not too sure that you'd want to buy this , but if you can forgive the slow parts this is worth seeing ( fast forward anyone ? ) .
Great looking film is just another trip to the charnel house that really wasn't necessary	If a movie could exist on imagery alone this movie would be Tops of the Pops . But most films must have some semblance of a narrative thread and this is where the film falls down . Literally beginning with the birth of Leatherface this movie tries to explain what happened that lead up to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre . In reality its a retread of the earlier film ( s ) but spruced up with the additional material of how it all started , and giving a bit more background on the latest group of victims . As a story it comes across as been there and done that . Anyone who's seen either Tobe Hooper's original or the more recent remake has been down this road before and so interest wanes rather quickly . It also doesn't help that what we've seen before does not jibe with what we see here . Dropped clues in the first films and the sense of time of when things would have had to happened don't make sense , this takes only a couple of years before the first film ? Somehow I don't buy it , the ages of Leatherface and his family seem all out of whack if nothing else . ( Yes , I know I'm over thinking ) Where the film scores , and scores big is in the imagery it generates . Few films I have ever seen have have had such grotesque imagery . These are grotesqueries that you'd want to hang on your wall ( assuming you like the work of people like Joel Peter Witkin ) . The images along are mini masterpieces of the macabre . I'd could argue for an Oscar nom but people would probably want to cart me away . Regrettably thats all that this film has is its bleak look which grows tiresome after fifteen or twenty minutes , especially when we have to deal with its redo plot . I'd wait for cable for this one , unless you are a fan of disturbing images that have no content behind them .
Better than you think it should be	A nudie western , sort of . Yes the Indians are all topless women but they are barely , no pun intended , in it . Its about a group of people who go off to find gold in Indian territory and being picked off one by one . Its pretty much a straight forward western for much of its running time . Actually its a good , but by no means great , b western that would be totally forgotten had it not had the naked Indians . Frankly its better than many program westerns that had been cranked out over the years . I'm guessing that the topless girls were added simply to be able to get some sort of ticket sale . Its 53 minutes and isn't a bad way to spend a rainy hour .
Important , but dated look at the end of the world .	This is a story about the end of the world . It takes two hours to get there but when it comes its quite spectacular . This is the story of two superpowers speeding toward war . In the middle are the Japanese and the people who live in Japan . We watch as the impending doom affects the lives of several regular Japanese , and we watch as the troops in the bunkers prepare to send their missiles . Its sad its maudlin and its very dated . Special effects aside the film when dealing with the military looks all wrong , the fake superpowers are distracting . The fact that both superpowers speak in often oddly accented English distracts from the film , as does the fact that what they say is basically stilted discussion of the wisdom of war . I can imagine that this film once rocked peoples world , in particular in the full 110 minute version , but now it remains as a talky , dated film about the end of the world . I'm not certain its worth seeing because it is so soapy and stilted , whoever it is important in that this film very graphically shows what will be left after the bombs drop , nothing , nothing but black ruins and dead bodies . As a film , as a warning . PS - If you want to see the bombs drop its about 100 minutes in
Triumph of the filmmakers art left me cold	Deep brooding melding of numerous ideas and themes including riffs from Hitchcock , Beauty and the Beast , Val Lewton , Lewis Carrol , and on and on . Its the very Gothic tale of a woman who meets a man who may have loved her in the past . A triumph of the filmmakers art the story left me cold . I suspect that watching the film well after midnight was a bad idea where its lush visual pleasures helped me to nod off . I know that the films insistence about being about something didn't help , I wanted a 1940's mystery , what I got was psychological drama . I'm going to have to watch this again down the road when its much earlier in the evening . ( It is great to look at though )
Better then the usual slavery exploitation film	Period set tale of the slave trade in Africa and how the nominal hero , Ron Ely goes from supporting it to instead helping to end it . Good melodramatic story is full of all of the exploitation hallmarks you'd expect - nudity , violence , general bad behavior - , but done less garishly and over the top in films like Mandingo and The Drum or any of the other films from the 70's that exploited the slave trade in the name of teaching us all a lesson . There aren't many of these films and for the most part they are a poor lot with most of the films so bad that they are funny . This one however is better then the rest even if it does get a bit melodramatic . The best thing I can say is its a watchable potboiler .
Good action make this worth seeing on cable	Russell Mulcahy's sequel to the spin off of the Mummy Returns is the early days of the Rock's character involving the quest for vengeance for the death of his father and other the freeing of a repressed kingdom . Looking like a good TV movie this could have been interesting if the cast could actually have turned in better than adequate performances . The slow diction of the bad guy alone is responsible for an additional ten minutes in screen time . The idea that we should enunciate is all well and good but there should be some emotion and a normal rate to the speech . The action is fine and the fantastical elements are okay and under the right conditions this could be an okay time passer . Worth a look when it hits cable . . . on a slow night .
For women only	Two women , friends since childhood and both wanting to be married at the Plaza , become enemies of a sort when both get engaged at the same time and angle for the same wedding at the same place . I'm clearly not the audience for this . I really can't say if its worth seeing as a result . I'm sure if I was a woman I probably would have liked this better , but I'm not so I didn't . I thought some of it was funny but I found it too artificial and superficial ( It didn't help I didn't like the women ) . If you're a woman I'd give it a shot . If you're not I'd probably give it a pass . ( And when did Kate Hudson start to look so old and artificial ? )
If you like zombies and cute girls and nothing else this movie is for you	Shot on video film about a girls swim team that is forced to battle flesh eating zombies when a new " popular " virus that is spread by people who don't wash their hands begins running rampant in the school . This is nothing but zombies and cute Japanese girls in and out of swimsuits . There is a great deal of blood , violence and gratuitous nudity and very little in the way of plot . I dare you to try to come up with anything to say about it other than it is exactly what it is , there is no attempt to be deep and meaningful just chicks and chomps . I think I've found one of the few films that defies criticism except if you're offended by this sort of thing . I don't know if its good or if its bad , but it as niche as you can go .
Proof is proof that Gwyneth was wrong for the part	This is the story of a young woman who's genius father has passed away . As she deals with the aftermath of his death she also has to come to terms with the possibility that she may have inherited not only his genius but his madness . The film is not the play . The play is a simple four character piece that takes place on the porch of the house that Catherine and her father lived in . Here its been opened up and expanded . New scenes and new characters have been added . There are additional twists and turns that have been . I don't know if all of the additions really work . The story worked on stage because of the limitations of the stage prevented the story from wandering too far a field . Unfortunately when they opened up the piece it wanders all over the place and seems less focused . For me the biggest problem is the central casting of Catherine . I saw Proof several times when it played on Broadway . I saw the original star and Tony winner Mary Louise Parker who was very good , and I saw Anne Heche who was excellent . Gwyneth Paltrow did the show and London and was met with mixed reviews . When movie talk happened I was hopeful that Paltrow was not going to be in the film , but since she bought the film rights she was a lock . Paltrow looks good but her performance is all over the place , one minute frumpy , one minute edgy , one minute beauty queen . It never gels for me so I have trouble accepting it as anything other than a shameless attempt at getting a second Oscar . ( Granted what I think is the disjointed nature of the film doesn't help . ) I really don't care for this film . Its not horrible , but its not good . They took a good but over rated ( the play won the Tony and Pulitzer ) and turned it into something considerably less . I don't know if its bias from having seen the play or just having to deal with a movie that isn't very good . If you like the cast give it a try , but I'm not sure you're going to be singing its praises .
a first film	Werner Herzog's first film . Its ten minutes of muscle men pumping iron and flexing while Jazz music plays . Every now and then a title asks if this Hercules will perform one of the labors and we then cut to what that might mean in the modern day . A curious beginning to Herzog's career . Considering the other films that the director has produced it seems very much out of place , although his use of music is very much in evidence . Its not much of anything mostly because it doesn't have time to be much of anything . I don't know if its really worth bothering with unless you're a fan of the directors work or manage to see it in conjunction to other early Herzog films ( his website is selling his shorts collected )
Good set pieces are hurt by the weaker bits that connect them	When a terrorist group sets off an series of bombs in Saudi Arabia , the FBI's crack investigators are forbidden to go investigate . When one of their number pulls some strings and resorts to blackmail to get his team on site they suddenly find themselves in an alien world and have now become targets for various groups who don't want them there . After a bang up beginning ( the attacks are really scary ) the film slowly fades out as the team begins to investigate and the the forces opposing them begin to circle . It isn't until the maybe the final twenty minutes that the film picks up the pace again and matches the opening minutes . Don't get me wrong there is tension and such between the opening and closing killer bits of action , but at the same time its nowhere near the level it should be , partly because of a combination of not much " happening " but also because some of what does almost seems like cliché . Do we already have extremist terrorist clichés ? ( and it doesn't help that the trailers made this look like an explosion a minute action film , which it isn't ) . A bit better than I'm giving it credit for , this is worth a look at some point down the road .
A look at those who obsess about movies and must see their films projected	Cinemania is a documentary about a bunch of crazy people in NYC who spend their lives watching films ( in theaters ) . Either on disability or independently wealthy or working dead end jobs , they exist to just go to the movies . . . several times a day ( and its go to the movies not watch videos ) . Yea I know they are like me . . . or not I don't need the projected image , I am happy with video and I do try to actually do things with people other than films or theater . . . Even by my standards these people are nuts-and I know buffs like them , who are more obsessive then sane ( one of which was in a mental hospital - my friends-not in the movie ) . These are people who for the most part must see good films ( one guy who is like me and will watch anything is derided ) in good conditions or else they get nuts , complaining to the manager or even getting violent ( The sole woman in the bunch was banned from The Museum of Modern Art's screening room for her bad behavior . ) I admire their drive and ability to do nothing but sit but these people are too much . I would love to have a screen on 24 7 but I'd do other things while I watched . The film itself is good , if a tad long ( Apparently it was originally intended for Finish TV and ran a half hour shorter ) . We get to know the people pretty well and we see their mania and we even like them . The thing is that running some 85 minutes the film runs out of steam because for the most part these are limited people and watching them talk about movies is different then talking to them about films ( Having been around people like this I know its better to be involved then on the sideline ) . I liked it and recommend it , but I'm not sure I'll watch it again . ( I am frightened that I could recognize the inside of most of the theaters shown . . . . )
Good but nothing special	In name only sequel to the film Sherlock Holmes movie Sherlock Holmes and the Spider Woman . The plot here has a young woman staying at a house with a strange woman named Zenobia ( played by Gale Sondergaard from the Holmes film ) as a house keeper / companion . Unknown to the young woman is the fact that Zenobia is draining her of some blood every night to feed to her plants . Standard but somewhat awkward thriller isn't bad , but isn't anything special . The film feels like a program horror film where they just sort of threw elements together and hoped that they stuck . Is it a horror film or a pseudo-Holmes film ? Its never really clear and the film suffers for it . The producers even went so far as to put another connection to the Holmes series by having Rondo Hatton as a mute Handyman , but he isn't given much to do other then look menacing . . Its good but nothing special .
Brother Against Brother	Two brothers battle it out for the love of a slave girl in ancient Babylon . Its got Hammurabi and Zoroaster thrown into the mix of a familial relationship gone sour . It ends with one hell of a flood and a raging fire . ( Look for the burning candle that falls on a drowning woman's face . ) A perfectly forgettable time killer .
Editing by the Blender in the Corner	While I really like the work of Robert Rodriguez I really must wonder why this movie was made . I'm still not completely certain of what happens or why despite seeing this two times . The lack of coherent plotting make this a tough film to fully enjoy . Characters come and go with little reason and there is often the sense that this would make sense in a 9 hour version . The individual sequences that make up the film are wonderfully staged and very funny ( I love Johnny Depp and the candy selling kid ) , but nothing hangs together . Rodriguez has made a film of mind blowing action but completely failed to stitch the sequences together into a plot that makes anything but fleeting sense . The acting is very good but Depp's cameo as a priest adds a layer of confusion that I don't think was ever suppose to be there . Rent this or watch it on cable before you make any decisions on buying it since odds are good you'll love the parts much more than the whole .
unremarkable remake	Freddy Francis directs another retelling of Donovan's Brain . This is the story of a rich SOB industrialist who is killed , however his brain is saved . As scientists try to study the still living organ the personality of the " dead " man begins to exert itself on those around the brain tank . Good , with expressive black and white photography , this too is a bit unremarkable and slightly dull , which is odd considering Francis ' films tend to have a bit more life in them , even when they are poor . Interesting to see Bernard Lee ( M from the early Bonds ) in a different sort of role . Not bad but not really the gripping drama I wanted at 2am to keep me awake . . . it put me out .
While good in pieces this is not a movie by any stretch of the imagination , its just some episodes from the TV show	First a couple of things : 1 . Despite what the box says the movie is only one hour long , a scant number of seconds over 60 minutes . 2 . Only two of experiments actually show up prior to the last two minutes of the movie . 3 . This is a rip off if you BUY the film since its nothing more than what should have been the pilot for the show . This should have been shown on TV as part of the show and not as a " movie " . That said its not bad . Its a " movie " that does not work as a whole but in moments and in throw away lines and actions . It also had a great villain in what is the French Taunter from Holy Grail in hamster form . The plot , which is more like a hope than a real plot has Gantu being hired by the hamster to get the previous experiments and what happens as a result . There's a bit more to it then that but since its not much more I feel I have to leave something for you to find out on your own . As I said this is a movie of moments which is what you'll take away from this attack on your wallet by Disney . The moments , and there are many , will have you smiling , or laughing at there cleverness , a cleverness who's level is so high you'll wonder what the hell happened to the rest of the movie . . . Is this worth seeing ? Yes , but rent it or borrow it , do not buy this . Will I see it again ? On cable or TV . Frankly this is one of those things that should have worked but doesn't . Its annoying since its as if they had ideas but no idea how to string them into a viable plot . . . ( then again its TV episodes ) Allowing that the animation is by turns good , garbage or passable , one wonders if they had three levels of animators working on this each doing a different shot in turn . This is , on the whole , nowhere near as good as the real movie , who's ending it wipes away completely with talk that the sister and her boyfriend haven't dated , or that some of the events alluded to couldn't have happened in the stills simply because there are now the new creatures . Its as if a few weeks have passed since the end of the theatrical movie , not the year or so that is implied by the end stills . In pieces and on a level for unstained silliness this is the equal of the first film , but only in the quick moments that never gel . ( This is not a ringing endorsement of the movie only that it should be seen in what ever way puts as little money in the coffers of the Disney company ) and
A culture clash drama with a couple of action scenes in it , this is worth a look for those who want something thats not run of the mill .	1902 in the Philippines , a group of American Calvary soldiers are dispatched to a small town to make friends and to put down the local uprising . Slowly they begin to win over the people in the town , however one of the rebels refuses to give up even though he sees the changes being made in the town . More drama than action film , there are two maybe three action sequences in the film , this is a film more about bridging cultures . Will the people see the soldiers are only their for their own good ? Will the rebel give up his fight ? You'll have to watch the film and see . Unevenly acted thanks to the hit or miss acting ability of the Filipino actors and actresses this still manages to covey sense of being real people trying to come to terms with an occupation . While seeming to drift into exploitation territory with its run of the mill plot points , it still has some powerful moments such as the soldier going to meet the family of a woman who was nursing him , and to whom he's lost his heart . There is something about his not being able to deal with the poverty in which they live that breaks the heart . I liked this movie . It probably deserves more than the I've given it simply because it was a nice change of pace . I think that I've rated it a bit lower than I should have simply because I put the film on because I was in the mood for an action film . Despite my disappointment I managed to hang in to the end which says a great deal about the enjoyment factor . Worth a look for those wanting a change of pace .
What an annoying bunch of jerks .	Cranky family learns to love and have a good time . Dennis Quaid is a super intelligent but miserable professor with a son who doesn't care for him , a daughter-Ellen Page playing a Juno variation - who is equally smart and miserable as her dad , an adopted brother , Thomas Haden Church who is a loafer , and a doctor he's trying to woo , Sarah Jessica Parker . Give it points for allowing everyone to turn in really good performances , but take some away because the film feels so constructed as to be completely unreal . Say what you will about Ellen Page in Juno spouting charming remarks , here she does the same thing and it comes off forced . Its an independent film trying to be quirky and you can feel it . If it wasn't for the name stars this film would not have gotten any sort of notice . ( And yes I who don't particularly like Jessica Parker and Haden Church really do like them in this film . ) . Unremarkableness aside , its still worth a look on cable .
A dull central character hurts a film filled with great asides and one liners	Beautiful pieces never hang together in this tale of a family pet who ends up in the sewer when a rat from the street turns the tables on him and flushes him down the toilet . This is the first Aardman piece that I really don't care for . Certainly I will watch it again to see if I'm wrong , but for the most part this film didn't work for me . Its not that the film is bad , as such , its not , its just that Hugh Jackman's lead is rather a dull fellow . From the moment his owners left him home alone and he began to occupy himself in the big house all alone I was lost . There was no reason for me to care about him or his world . That changes to some degree once he gets into the sewer which holds a vast number of visual an aural wonders to behold . From a mini version of London to slugs that sing to spoofs and one liners this film is all about the throwaways ( many of which are real gems ) . As a group of loosely connect bits its more than fine , unfortunately there is nothing to hold the bits together and as a result the film falls apart . Worth a look for Aardman fans and for those are undemanding in their cartoons .
Good version of Shakespeare's tale is hurt by the limits of live 1950's TV	Peter Brook directs an abbreviated version ( 75 of the shows 90 minutes ) of Lear for the 1950's TV show Omnibus with Orson Welles as Lear in a live performance that removed all of the subplots and just focused on Lear . Welles makes for a formidable Lear and I would have loved to have seen a version with him on the stage . He is the proper force of nature required by the role while also being quite touching . The production itself is a rather run of the mill , owing in part to the conventions of TV , which works against the production because we're left with a bit too much posturing and limited movement on the screen . The film in away actually reminds me of a Welles film from the period with a good many closeups and Welles wearing too much make-up ( During the Blow Wind Speech Lear loses his mustache which end up flapping in the wind ) . Its a good production , one of the better filmed Lears I've seen , that ends up confined and hurt by the needs for the television camera . Worth seeing for Welles performance and a promise of what might have been great on the stage ( instead of good on the screen )
Interchangeable With its English Remake	Even for a Japanese film this film is slow . The pacing of the film drains off much of the fear that should be there in a story that could happen to anyone of us who watches video . In some ways this film is slightly better than the remake if only in the fact that its lack of fancy special effects makes it seem like its happening right there in front of you . ( SPOILER : certainly the out of the TV scene is better here . END SPOILER ) Ultimately this is an over rated film who's power comes not from the images and storytelling but rather from the fact that we are all potential victims of a tape that kills after viewing . I suppose that years ago the story would have been of a book that kills . This isn't to say that its a bad film , its not . Its just not the genre changing one that many of us who love horror films had been led to believe it was .
Amusing comedy is unremarkable but clever and interesting enough to make it worth watching	Hollywood publicity agent comes up with the idea to cast a real gangster in the lead of the studio's new gangster movie . The agent , his girl and the director go to a restaurant to find a real gangster and spot the perfect one when he slugs another mobster and then runs into the night . They follow him and convince him to take the role . He's not a gangster in real life , but everyone thinks he is , especially the real gang lord he punched in the face in the restaurant . This is an amusing but unremarkable little film . Showing signs of the meager budget it still gives a nice sense of being more than just a sound stage bound tale with some nice exteriors , a chase through the streets of Hollywood and enough variation in the sets that you don't feel its just the same place redressed . The cast is game with Frank Albertson being very amusing as the fast talking PR man who seems really to be running everything going on around him . Also a joy is John Davidson as the director . I'm a big fan of Davidson from his numerous movie serial appearances so it was nice to see him take a role where he was really vital to the plot and where he could do more than just be a sinister henchman . The print I saw was one of the retitled Hollywood Mystery , which is more than a misnomer since there really is no mystery to speak of , the film being more a comedy about Hollywood . Worth a bag of popcorn and a soda , especially if you can watch it as part of a double feature .
I like it not love it-I'm just pecked to death by little flaws . . . which I'll tell you about . . . ( SPOILERS )	( Contains lots of spoilers ) Too long ago I read the source novel by Neil Gaiman , or rather half , stopping not because the story was bad but rather because I disliked the way the story is told . I'm of a similar mind concerning the film adaptation . First and foremost I have to say I like the film . Its an okay time killer . Its not the be all and end all that some people have claimed-most recently a person in my office who basically accosted me with her " best film " talk . Its an okay film thats wounded by some deep flaws . Keep in mind I do like the film ( even as I break it into pieces ) Do I need to tell the plot or can we just assume that most people reading this already know the story is that a young man promises to get a falling star for his lady love never imagining that the star would be a young woman . As a fantasy film it looks pretty good , though to be perfectly honest in the bootleg copy I've looked at actually looks better since its less " flashy Hollywood dress up " . The effects mostly work and I don't think I can really fault the film on a technical level . The problems for the most part are two fold , namely some of the casting and the script or perhaps the work of Matthew Vaughn ( and sometimes both at the same time ) . Sienna Miller is wasted and her part so badly written that there is no sense why Charlie Cox has any interest in her - other than she looks beautiful . She is bland . The same can be said for Claire Danes who looks good but is so incredibly dull . She radiates nothing as the love interest at all . Robert DeNiro looks good but his fay reading of Shakespeare is often amusing but more often than not really belongs in another movie . Its a choice , which like several other " knowing " choices that make me want to slap director Matthew Vaughn around . Let me get into the script and Vaughn's choices . First off the knowing nods that pervade the film wobble it . If the film had been a knowing homage like the Princess Bride ( damn I didn't want to mention that ) where most of it is tongue in cheek things would be fine , but Vaughn wants to have to it both ways , he wants a serious fantasy with a hero and villains but he also wants to be silly and send it up . Examples ? The way Michelle Pfeiffer looks in the mirror seems much too out of date . We have Captain Shakespeare being overly swishy , which doesn't quite work , we have some of Ricky Gervais ' schtick being anachronistic and we have the ghosts of the dead which serve no purpose except to act as redundant Greek chorus and to take an edge off the blood letting . They made me think that they had some left overs make up designs from Pirates of the Caribbean and since Vaughn was such a fan of the Frighteners he decided to use them . Is the movie silly or serious , I don't think the film knows and it cuts down the suspense since neither the witches nor the princes ( especially the princes ) are ever truly frightening . The other thing that really bothers me is that it makes no sense internally . Never mind that its top heavy with foreshadowed contrivances ( oh please I knew how it was going to go from the start ) and cheats ( candle ) , this movie makes no real sense whats so ever . Want examples ? How long was the trip on the sky boat ? There's a long sequence of Shakespeare teaching Tristan and yet the time that passes for the witch and the princess seems so much less . Even if its not how fast did Tristan learn ? The unicorn would never have brought Danes to the inn . Why ? because if it would know about the other dangers it would know that the whole place was bad . How can the magic ( candle ) work in Wall when there is some inference that once you cross the wall the magic is gone . The climax in the witches castle doesn't play right from the cutting of the strap onward . There are more instances but those are the ones immediately stand out ( The Unicorn one got me shhhhhed when I said that the unicorn would never have taken her to the inn out loud . ) I could go on and I could dismantle the film ( pieces that serve no purpose , The out of place music , the over done riding shots , the goats-which sound good on paper but make no practical sense ) but I don't see the point . Its the type of film you're either going to love for what it is flaws and all or you're going to find annoying because it pecks you to death with little details . Personally I've been pecked . A good but not great movie . Certainly not something I need to see again , but which is worth seeing with a bag of popcorn and soda in the right sort of mind-frame . Strangely I'm very disappointed . I know some thought I would hate the film and dismiss it out of hand , but I don't , and I'm not . Actually its good enough that I'm really angry that its not better . I'm annoyed because what I think are glaring errors could have and should have been fixed . This is one of those movies than almost works and falls in the cracks . I mean this is taking the line about reaching for the stars and having what we want exceed our grasp a bit too literally .
Good action film	The Big Screen version of the small screen cult favorite is a pretty good thriller . No , its not the best movie in the world but a good way to spend two hours . The plot concerns a wanted international criminal who offers 100 million to anyone who will spring him . The action is mostly realistic as are the characters . The real complaint is that the captain is too much of an ass and there are one or two bumps that don't ring true , especially at the end but its not anything that will spoil the fun . Best of all there are a couple of really good action sequences . Recommended , especially on cable
Holmes meets Jack the Ripper in a Technicolor thriller	I have no idea how many times Sherlock Holmes has battled Jack the Ripper over the years but here he is at it again , and in brilliant color to boot . I mention the color since the film , coming as films were rapidly being only made in color , takes great pleasure in showing us the colorful world of Victorian London and White Chapel in particular . Its a very 1960's sort of thing to do , as is the use of bongos on the soundtrack . Neither of these things really hurt the films plotting , but they do place it in a reality that could only be an English film studio in the 1960's . There's a feeling attached to many non-Hammer English films of the period that the producers were trying to give you something you couldn't get at home on a black and white TV , namely color . This need to show off detracts from what is a good thriller . The plotting of Holmes attempt to solve the Ripper killings is reasonably well done . The hows and whys of the killings are interesting , however I have to say that I find that they are not as well done as in Murder by Decree , which is one of my favorite films ( Holmes or otherwise . ) For this reason I have some reservations , which are purely personal and should not stop you from at least watching this good movie . John Neville as Holmes gives a very human portrait of a man of both mind and action , doing what ever it is to get the case solved . His relationship with Watson is pretty much as equals , something that is missing from most Holmes films which present the Holmes / Watson relationship in such away as to make you wonder why they are friends . I like that you can understand why they are together . Over all , a good little movie , though as I said it suffers by comparison .
Some great action sequences are lost in a film who's script tries to do too much and be all things to all people	Add my voice to those underwhelmed by the latest edition of the Spiderman franchise . While it does contain some of the best action sequences I've ever seen , it is far from the best film ever made . The problem with the film is that there is simply too much going on . First off you have the Peter / MJ relationship bumping along , add to that the Peter / Harry story line still playing out , plus we have the addition of the Sandman story and coming in in the final half hour is the addition of Venom . Its too much for the movie to handle , the result of which it all feels half baked . Very few of the characters get the proper amount of time to develop with the worst offender is Eddie Brock and Venom who get zero and so seem to belong in another movie ( Venom looks great which makes his under use seem even worse ) . The real proof the film has too much going on was that there are a couple of times where the plot is moved along by sudden out of left field revelations . The only one I " ll reveal , because its in the trailer , is that Sandman killed Uncle Ben in the first film . Had the film been better plotted the revelation wouldn't have been necessary , nor would any of the others . There are some bright spots , the majority of the Sandman material is sterling , with the first appearance of Sandman in the sand pit almost perfect , and the sequence that makes up his first battle with Spidey one of the greatest things I've ever seen put on film . The Sandman sequences alone make it worth slogging through the ups and downs of the rest of the movie . Is it a bad movie ? No , just a disappointing one . Its clear that this could have and should have been the best in the series ( and maybe the best film of the year ) had all of the right pieces been put in place , indeed the final sequences in the film probably would have reduced most audiences to tears had they gotten the rest of the film right . As I said the film is worth seeing at some point , just don't feel the need to run out with everyone else . Was it worth fighting the crowds the first weekend to see ? Not really , but it is worth seeing . Hopefully they'll take a break before they make the next one , maybe they'll make the one that this movie should have been
The cliché ending ruins an otherwise good film	Hot Shot button pushing filmmaker is touring an abandoned prison when he finds he's not alone . Soon his jailer has turned the tables on the director who loves to film people unaware . Good short film stumbles in the final minutes as it becomes clear that the film is going exactly where so many other films have gone . I really liked the film up to the point where it clearly slipped into the clichéd rut , I mean how could you not it has really good acting and some really good dialog . I just wish it had a real original ending . Worth a look when it hits cable .
And I screamed at the screen in frustration . . . .	. . . and continued to scream in this review . . . . This is a good movie that should have been better . This is actually a great film that was tinkered with to the point of becoming middling . This film , inspired rather than based on Asimov's book , is a film of ideas that is corrupted by the need to be a big Hollywood movie . Time and time again this film lingers on the spectacle when it hits every small moment . What were they thinking ? No , this is not vintage Will Smith , and yes the female lead is pretty bad , but the film still works . Despite a completely unreal world this film still works . Despite the fact that the film was wounded by Smith battling Proyas for the shape of the film , it still works whenever the small personal moment , or the moments of ideas , for example Smith's first meeting with James Cromwell floored me in its simplicity and perfection . . . and left me to wonder what this film might have been . See this on TV where I'm certain the small moments will play better than on the big screen . Then again it will leave you sobbing for what might have been .
One of the best Mascot serials	One of the best Mascot serials concerns a couple of marines taking on the Tiger Shark a masked criminal who is trying to steal a gyro compass and prevent his hide out island from being turned into a military base . This is an action packed serial that is better in the chapters then it is in the cliffhangers . The cast is good ( with great chemistry between the two leads ) , the action better . This is as good as Mascot gets , and in its way it might have rivaled some of Republics best work had it had a music track . Its a minor thing but the lack of music ( something Mascot didn't really splurge for at any point ) makes a little slow at times . That flaw aside this is one to watch . Its actually very good .
Better than I remembered it	Giant Behemoth surprised me . Catching the film really from the first frame for the first time in years I was shocked by just how damn good the movie is . Owing more to the British thrillers such as the Quatermass films and the stark black and white horror films of Hammer ( X The Unknown ) or things like the Day the Earth Caught Fire ( which while released 2 years later has similar feel ) or Corridors of Blood , this is for a good chunk of the film a dark detective story of sorts as the monster remains hidden and the scientists try to figure out whats going on . There is complexity of the story , fish kills , radiation and a sense that this is a larger problem , that is lacking from most American films of the time period and the genre . Strangely , the monster , which always bothered me , actually looked pretty good . If you look at the monster itself I think you'll see that compared to the Beast from 20000 fathoms , this is the better monster . if you look at the design and the skin texture the monster actually looks realer than Beast which seems to be more a block of clay . the problem here is that O'Brien's animation isn't very good at times . A throw back to his 1920's work on the Lost World ( watch the way the neck and head move ) , its clear that O'Brien was regressing from his peak on King Kong ( Mighty Joe Young doesn't count , Harryhausen actually animated most of that ) . To be certain part of the problem is that speed was required , Behemoth had a limited budget so it had to be done fast as possible , but ultimately O'Brien wasn't that creative an animator ( he may have been the father of the technique but his children made it into something ) . Luckily the monster is shown in shadow and darkness frequently so we can't always see whats going on , which is good since it adds a sense of mystery to the proceedings that Beast is lacking . By no means a " great film " behemoth is actually a better film than I think its given credit for . I think had the monster been changed or better handled this would have had a reputation beyond the earlier Beast . For a great double feature watch Beast from 20 , 000 Fathoms after this for a nice follow up ( Events in Beast are kind of mentioned in the final fade out )
Costner and Hurt Sshine in this tale of a serial killer	Kevin Costner is a great guy and man of the year sort of fellow who has a dark side-he's a serial killer . On one of the biggest nights of his life Brooks gives in to the voice in his head ( played by William Hurt ) and begins to kill again . Unfortunately he's spotted by Dane Cook who wants to go out with him on the next kill . Costner hopes there's no next time however circumstance reawakens the old urge and . . . well thats the movie . Good little thriller is given a great shot in the arm by the interplay of Costner and Hurt . They are the whole movie and are the reason ( a really good reason ) to watch this movie . Worth a look but you may end up like me and wish that Costner and Hurt would link up again in a movie better suited to let them let go .
Excellent action film thats a bit too tied to Japanese history for Western eyes	This is the story of a Christian martyr who is killed when the uprising he is leading is put down . Vowing vengeance he returns from the dead and with the help of other unhappy souls he tries to destroy the shogun responsible for his death . Opposing him is swordsman Jubei , who has to fight his way through the undead minions in order to stop the plot to bring chaos to the world . ( The Jubei character was a real person and shows up in other Japanese tales ) This is the second version of a historically based supernatural novel . The earlier film starred Sonny Chiba and was an action packed film that made very little sense but was fun to watch . Here we have a nice blend of action and plot , then again maybe its too much plot . While this is an excellent action film , though the larger implications of who some of the characters really are was lost on me since I'm not as well versed in Japanese history . This is a film that assumes you know the period that the film takes place since it brings many real people and places into play . Who ever put the DVD I saw together must have been aware of the need to be informed on Japanese history and customs so they included , as part of the subtitled track , helpful tidbits about terms and people and places . It helps in the short term but by half way into the film I was feeling a bit lost . Still this is a very good movie . The action is spectacular , the opening castle assault is amazing , and the horror is scary , how the dead come back will probably creep you out . This is a well thought out and well made supernatural action film . I recommend it , with the understanding that you may feel a bit lost ( Though that's not a reason to pass this by since it is a good film )
So much better than you think it is	The advantage to having seen every episode of the original Star Trek series is that when some one lifts the plot of three or four of the episodes and turns them into a Turkish comedy it becomes very easy to follow . For those without a running knowledge of episode titles this mainly the salt monster episode redone as a feature with the inclusion of a few other episodes thrown in for good measure . However this is not just a straight Star Trek movie , rather its part of a series of comedies staring a character named Omer . This makes for a strange mix of wild comedy and straight science fiction drama . Amazingly its nowhere near as bad as you might think . Actually its quite good . The Star Trek lifts come off more as a well done fan film than any sort of bad movie . Personally I wish this was translated into English so that I could have some idea what was being said during the comedic verbal exchanges between Omer and Spock . I get and can laugh at the physical humor but since I can't speak the language the verbal sparring is lost . It you're a Trek fan see this movie . If you're a science fiction fan give it a shot . I think you'll be pleasantly surprised . Note to those who say this is a bad movie with bad acting and bad special effects - you have to admit that the original series , as charming and as nostalgic as we feel towards it , is about the same quality as this film on every level . You can't honestly think that the original episodes are more than marginally superior to this film , especially in the acting .
Good Late Late Show movie about pilots in the Great White North is the type of thing you'd stumble across and stay up all night watching	Red is a freight pilot somewhere in the North of Canada . He makes his living hauling freight by air all over the wilderness . He's a stand up guy in love with the local school teacher named Hillary . When Red's no good brother Paul comes North he starts up a competing business and tries moving in on Red's girl . Things get worse when Red's mechanic , and Hillary's brother , is killed in a plane crash . Hillary thinks its Red's fault . Will Red be able to win back his girl and put his brother in his place ? I guess you'll have to watch the movie and find out . This is a soapy melodrama about tough guys with a past fighting over business and a woman , but its a compelling movie that runs as long as it has to tell its story . Its small scale and efficient with some great scenery , some good performances and a plot that keeps you interested . Its the sort of thing that played in the wee hours of the Late Late Show after the main movies played but before the news or the farm report came on . The best thing that I can say is its the type of movie you'd stumble across on your way to bed and end up watching to the end ( and then have stuck in your head as you tried to figure out what the movie you just saw was because you missed the opening credits ) If you want a good , but not great , movie that will keep you interested for an hours entertainment , this is the film to get . Definitely worth a bag of popcorn .
Some of the best dialog ever written	This story of an ex-drug smuggler who's life is turned upside down by the police and the return of his partner , both of whom are looking for his stash of money would be a pretty run of the mill and unremarkable movie if it wasn't for some of the best written dialog I've ever heard . The words breath life in to what is nothing more than a film noir updated and turn it into a bouncy smart ass thriller that is genuinely comic at times . This is a movie that I will often put on in the background while doing other things because as far as I'm concerned the visuals are pointless . See this movie - or better yet , listen to it and hear how movies should sound .
Not the best serial ever made but entertaining and compulsively watchable	Group of young men at a private flying school are angling toward a career in the army as fliers ( Its during WW2 ) . Into the mix comes the Black Hangman a Nazi agent who is killing industrialists and looking for the map to Ankaban a lost city in Africa . Moving from the airfield to the jungle this is a neat little movie that sucks you in and carries you along . Clearly Universal actually cared about this serial , something not always evident in some of their wartime chapter plays . To be certain it doesn't stand out as as one of the great serials of all time , it is however compulsively watchable as I found out when I put this on to watch a chapter or two and found myself five or six chapters in with out a thought . I really liked it . Plot wise I'm not sure if its a good thing that we know who the Black Hangman is in the second chapter ( or first if you recognize the voice ) , I would have thought they could have used the masked villain to grater effect , but at the same time it is interesting that his Nazi masters clearly hold him in contempt and are planning on using him to their own ends . One doesn't usually get this many layers of good and bad guys . Definitely worth a look
A good little thriller	This is a good little thriller from the beginnings of sound . The only real problems it has are due to the era it was made , one when music wasn't a standard part of talkies , so the pace can seem a bit slow . The plot concerns a murder during an elaborate game of charades . The bullets fired aren't blanks and as a result no one is playing dead . Of course since the game was taking place during a very fancy party everyone is a suspect . A neat twist is that any of the stereotypical scenes of the detective bringing everyone together are at the beginning of the movie , well before the denouncement . The dialog is witty and the mystery keeps your interest , which is a big plus . I'm reasonably certain that the mystery is played pretty fairly which is nice since many times in movies the murderer comes out of left field . Despite this not listing as available on video , Alpha Video does have it as a double feature with the very short Moonstone , and the pair makes a nice evenings viewing .
Decent , but goofy tale of murder in a small town that you'll forget soon after viewing	There is a liberal dose of humor in this movie where Edgar Kennedy , master of the slow burn , plays a sheriff investigating a murder in a small town . The point of the plot is the Black Doll of the title and a harbinger of death which appears and disappears through out the proceedings . Kennedy is " aided " by a newspaper reporter who manages to put the whole thing together . Its a breezy 65 minutes that fly by almost as an after thought . The mystery is clever but it seems stretched out to fill the required running time . The cast is quite good and the whole thing has the feel of something from a lazy Sunday . Its so breezy as to be utterly forgettable . I recently found this on one of my video tapes and was totally baffled by what it was . I know that I had watched this previously since I removed the commercials at some earlier time , but I can't for the life of me remember ever seeing it other than when I just popped it into the VCR last night . Now some twelve hours later I find the film rapidly disappearing from my mind . If you want to see a film you'll enjoy for its running time but which will leave no trace on you consciousness , this is the movie for you .
Witty dialog lifts a run of the mill sea yarn	Buster Crabbe is Captain Silver master of the ship the Sea Hound sailing in the waters of the South Seas . Based on a comic this Columbia serial is good but very workman like . The plot concerning the battle to out smart the Commodore and get a hidden treasure moves along at a leisurely pace and could have used the removal of several chapters . As with many Columbia serials the requirement to have them run for 15 chapters produces some dead spots , though this has less then is normal for the company . It helps that the dialog is witty as Silver's aides crack wise with each other so that the physical acts are supplemented by verbal sparring . I liked this serial but found that trying to watch it for a second time in one sitting was rather tough , more so since I watched the similar nautical serial also starring Crabbe Piratesof the High Seas ( which lifts material from this ) not that long ago . Recommended but in bits and pieces at a time when you haven't been watching a good number of Columbia serials .
Great Dialog and a great cast is the reason to watch this truly enjoyable ( if not really mysterious ) mystery	Lee Tracy plays Brad McKay a smart mouthed reporter loved , or at least respected by both the police and the criminals . When a reforming special prosecutor , who's work he had been covering , is killed McKay is thrust in to the thick of things since its assumed that he may have a clue as to who might have killed the man . Tracy , an expert at playing fast talking wisenheimers , is in great form here delivering a steady stream of pontifications and wise cracks that not only amuse but also bamboozle the people around him giving him room to solve the case . I really liked this film a great deal since its a rare that a B-movie of this type had so many witty lines and comedic comebacks , it's almost like being hit by a machine gun of jokes . Tracy is aided by a great cast of character actors who manage to make their roles into something more than pieces to be moved around the chess board . If there is real weakness in the movie its that it becomes pretty clear who the bad guy is much too early in the film ( the problem is simply that there really isn't anyone else it could be ) . It's not fatal but it sort makes what happens a foregone conclusion . Despite its short comings this is a movie that you're going to watch for , especially if you like great dialog and witty exchanges .
Really good but unnecessary remake is one of the best of the recent glut of retread horror films and a fine horror film on its own	Remake of the Wes Craven horror classic ( considered by some ) that was based on Ingmar Bergman's Virgin Spring . The basic plot is simple . A band of villains brutalize a couple of girls out in the woods . When they need to take shelter they do so at the home of a nice family . All is going well until the family discovers that the visitors tortured their daughter and they decide to see that justice is done . Well made revenge flick with amped up violence and nastiness was an odd viewing experience for me . yes its well done and tense , with villains that really need killing , but now 35 years down the road the original has been riffed on so many times that there is little thats new here except the level of violence . I don't see why , other than for money ( despite no prospect for a sequel ) , why the original had to be remade . Then again I'm thrilled that here was a remake that doesn't stink . I mean how many horror films from the 1970's and 80's have been remade badly recently ? Yes its good . Yes its exactly what you think its going to be . No its not required viewing . If you like this sort of thing and know what you're getting into give it a shot .
Typical Tyler Perry drama is helped by two sterling leads in Bates and Woodard	The friendship between " rich " white Kathy Bates and " poor " black Alfre Woodard and the turmoil that occurs in their families is the fodder for the latest film from Tyler Perry . Pure potboiler its the sort of movie that hits every note you expect , especially if you've seen any number of Tyler Perry's earlier films . Its a solidly good film with some magical moments , Woodard and Bates make a wonderful on screen duo and I would love to see another pairing of them . If there is a flaw its that the script is pure potboiler . There is nothing wrong with that but I bit more reality could have made this into Perry's best film . Note to Tyler Perry : You are easily one of the best directors working today . Get away from the potboiler feel good chick flicks and do something else . Oscar is calling .
Influential western is actually quite good	Franco Nero stars as Django a drifter who pulls a coffin behind him in a western that spawn well over 50 pseudo-sequels and influenced film makers around the world . What a strange film . Barely released in the US this film is a good spaghetti western that isn't as wild as I'm sure it was in the day it was new . The plot has Django rescuing a woman from two different groups of men to get and then heading off to settle a score with a Major in an all but deserted town . Its a wild trip that for the first two thirds is a twisty western that makes you wonder what in the hell is really going on . The last half hour is a bit of a disappointment in that the twists seem unmotivated and just strange to be strange , although to be honest some of the twists are pretty cool . This is a gritty dirty western with a wicked sense of humor and a good way to spend 90 minutes . You'll for give me for not really critiquing it more than that but its hard to talk about some of what happens with out it either sounding unexciting or without giving too much away . If you get the chance do give it a shot .
A good , but atypical film from a master director	Herzog's short film about the doctors that fly all over central Africa to bring medical help to the people living in the bush . We fly with the doctors and they tell us about the history of their service and how they treat their patients . Its a very good , and considering the director almost too straight forward documentary . It has none of the earmarks of what you would think of as a Herzog film and if I had missed the opening credits I would never have guessed who directed it . To be honest the film is very reminiscent of a Mondo movie . Not because its sensational , rather because its African setting in the late 1960's coupled the narration makes it seem ( slightly ) more exploitive then it is ( I wonder if the English narrator did Mondo work ) . What I found interesting was the stories of the culture clashes that occur for the doctors , as say some of the tribesmen refused to climb stairs or a poster designed to warn the people about a fly that causes blindness are not understood by the people its suppose to help . Worth a look for the subject matter if nothing else .
A good start that wanders off .	Jupiter sends Heracles ( yes thats right , its not Hercules ) to get Ulysses and bring him to the cyclops for his little blinding trick . Its an odd film as what should be the adventures or two heroes are enemies for most of it . Somewhere along the lines they get captured by bird people and find their lady loves . The first 45 minutes constitute a pretty good , if cheaply made , adventure film . Unfortunately the second half spirals and then plummets into Mystery Science Theater 3000 territory as all sense is lost and technical errors , for example rock walls that ripple like cloth or hands appearing in empty holes , begin to over take any hope that the makers knew what they were doing . If you like off beat adventure films try the first half of this . . . I can't promise anything about the second .
Creepy thriller	Although hampered by a budget that doesn't allow for sterling effects this is a creepy little thriller that works best when showing the least . The story has echoes of any one of a dozen other films from Spirited Away to Wicker Man , but there is something about the underlying tension and feeling that something thats not right thats makes the film watchable for me . Its the trip thats the joy here , not the destination simply because you'll probably know what that is way in advance of our heroine . As long as they keep the scarecrows in the distance this is a creepy little gem that should be seen by those who are willing to go with a good but flawed film .
Really good espionage film	French telegram delivery girl is kidnapped and ends up in South America , . There she works her way to the Panama Canal zone where she hopes to find some one to help her get back to France . She finds work in a saloon singing . She also begins to make the acquaintance of various parties from around the world , all of whom seem to have hidden motives for everything they are doing . And some one's motive includes blowing up the canal with the American fleet in it . Very good espionage thriller will probably keep you guessing for a chunk of its running time as to who is good and who is bad . Its a compact little film that spins out its tale in nicely constructed bits . It took me a little bit to get hooked , but once Marie got to Panama I was hooked and allowed it to lead me around where ever it wanted to go . Surprisingly good , it made me regret not having pulled it from my pile sooner . Grab some popcorn and soda and make a night of it .
Really neat story of surviving for a year at the bottom of the world	Oscar winning documentary on Byrd at the Antarctic and his attempt to be the first to fly over it . This beautifully shot record of what Byrd had to do to be the first man to fly over the South Pole is the type of film that sucks you in and hold you for its entire running time . If you want to know what it was like to be one of the first people to explore the bottom of the world this is for you . To be certain others were there first Roald Amundsen , Scott and Shackleton were all there first , but Byrd was still there when there were no permanent facilities and a trip to the ice was a years long adventure . This is amazing stuff ( even if some of it seems staged ) . If there is any real flaw its that the flight to the Pole is almost anti-climatic when compared with just trying to survive . It should noted that the film is mostly silent . Sound film was really just taking off when the expedition was taking off , and even so the sound equipment would never have passed the weight restrictions . What sound there is comes from an introduction by Byrd , sound effects , and some narration during the actual flight . Recommended . ( More so if you've seen the footage of Ernest Shackleton and his ill fated trip since this adds to your knowledge of what it must have been like for them as well )
Atypical horror film is nicely creepy when it has to be .	( Spoilers head ) First of the David Goyer directed films that I've really liked ( He ruined Blade Trinity and The Invisible kind of was just there ) . The plot of the film has a young woman haunted by the visions of a boy and the statement that he wants to be born now . It transpires that she was a twin with a brother who died in the womb , and that her brother wants to be born . The reality is something much darker . Good , almost great horror film with Jane Alexander as a doctor who know much more than she's saying and Gary Oldman as a Rabbi who figure into the later portions of the film . Decidedly creepy with a low gore level this is a film that works because it slowly builds tension by not revealing too much . Plot wise it keeps you guessing until it has to reveal things . Weird images abound and they are used in such away that they make you wonder what you are seeing but at the same time go before the magic is dispelled . I really liked how the film goes and does and gets off . If there are any real flaws to the film its the that the film kind of becomes a tad less scary once we know whats going on . The problem is that we kind of get a handle on things about half way in and the film becomes a race to the end , which is fine but not knowing is half the fun . The other flaw is the very end of the film which begs the question why must everyone not have a definite ending in their horror tales any more ? I really liked it and look forward to picking it up on DVD when it comes out . Worth a look for those wanting to see a good horror film . Between 6 and 7
Good Natured Comedy Mystery	Guy Kibbee plays the titled detective in a meandering good natured romp that turns deadly . The plot of the film has an insurance company coming to call on Hanvey , a unique detective who has retired to the sticks . It seems a priceless jeweled necklace as gone missing and they want Hanvey to find it so they don't have to pay out the hundred grand . Hanvey finds out almost instantly that the jewels were taken as part of a bet and now they have to be put back with out anyone finding out . Unfortunately things turn deadly as the butler is killed and the wrong man is on the run with only Hanvey standing between him and the chair . Much of what happens is funny . Much of what happens seems to meander out of left field , but that's okay since its the loopiness of the proceedings that make this so watchable . This isn't the greatest film ever made but it is a good one that is far from run of the mill . I recommend this , especially if you've become tired of all of the other detective programmers of the 30's and 40's . ( though try to find the full version since some discount releases are well under an hour )
Better than the First	Able to do away with with character introductions the second Harry Potter film can move straight on with action . Although the film still suffers from being a bit too long the film has nowhere near as many draggy parts as the first one . If anything its the rabbit to the first one's turtle . Set pieces involving Ron's magic flying car are wonderful , and the spiders in this film would give the spider in Return of the King a run for their money . If you liked the first film , or even if you didn't , give this film a try since its a large step in the right direction of fantasy films . ( Although a large cash reward for the remains of that annoying house elf will be paid if it can be promised that I will never have to set eyes on him again . )
A Beautiful Looking Love Story	This movie is one of the most technically perfect films ever made . Its sense of time and place oozes off the screen . We are there watching the lives of two neighbors . The performances by everyone are dead nuts perfect and in an age of over or under acting by most of the acting community the two leads stand out as shining examples of how to be real on screen . The trouble with this movie is that its oblique . Its the tale of two people who meet and learn that their spouses are having an affair . The story is told mostly through short screens that highlight a moment and slowly build into something , the question is what . I reached the end of the film and was left wondering if I had missed something , it was very good but I wasn't certain what it was about . Looking at the Criterion DVD things became even more confused when I looked at the deleted scenes which alter the nature of the movie . Don't get me wrong . I like the movie , but I'm not certain it amounts to much in the end . . . then again I could be wrong , I need to see this again . If you want to see perfect acting with two performances that arc electricity then by all means see this movie . Just be warned that it may leave you wondering what it was all about in the end .
The Natives are Restless and a Lot of Fun	Stranded at a jungle outpost a singer tries to make her way home . Through circumstances beyond her control she ends up in the jungle on the run from Nazi's and the police who think she maybe connected to a murder . Reluctantly coming to her aid is a scientist with Mantan Moreland as an aide de camp . Back lot bound with some twists that must have been put in let the audience know that none of this was to be taken seriously , Law of the Jungle is an imperfect but very funny jungle adventure / comedy . Our heroine for once seems to be what she claims , a tough broad from Brooklyn way over her head . Her whiskey barrel voice is a nice change from the typical female shriek . Mantan Moreland is , as always , a joy to watch and how he shoots dice has to go down as one of the worst , and funniest scams in B movies . Is this the greatest movie ever made ? No , but its one you will be sorry to see end , especially when you see Moreland and the King interact . . This is one to look for , especially since its out on cheaply priced DVD .
A much better than average sword and sandal film	Brennus of Gaul moves on Rome in 391 BC . Unfortunately the one man who can save the empire has been dismissed and wants nothing to do with the empire . Three brothers are dispatched to try to make peace and then . . . Brennus , a stone faced golem of a man was a real individual . Here , played by Gordon Mitchell he is a frightening monster of a villain . Here at last is a bad guy who is the worthy equal to the type of hero that walks through movies like this . Amazingly this film is wonderfully plot heavy . More goes on in the first half hour than most two films of this kind combined . You watch the movie because what is happening is interesting , not because you're waiting for the next silly bit . If this should come on some late night , watch it , it'll hold your interest enough to keep you up until dawn .
Stay away from English dubs	Another case of where the dubbing destroys a decent little movie . The subtitled version I saw under the title of Hero of Babylon is much better than the Beast of Babylon with English dubbing . For what ever reason it plays less silly . The plot is the typical muscle bound hero fights and wins the freedom of an oppressed people but its done with just enough conviction of the leads that you do care what happens . The film is a really good action film for most of its run , falling into a bit of silliness as the tries to tie up all the plot threads .
Who's in charge here anyway ?	Two hit men go to Spain and pick up a fellow crook who went into hiding years before . They are suppose to drive him back to Paris , however as they hit the road , it quickly becomes clear that things are not what they seem and that the hit men are in for more than they ever bargained for . Tightly plotted and neat little thriller that works thanks to its three stars . Terrence Stamp kicked his career into high gear once more with his turn as the man hauled off for execution . So calm in the face of death its almost unnerving and its not hard to see how he can begin to play his captors like a violin . John Hurt and Tim Roth are his equal as the two hit men who never saw what they were walking into . This is ensemble acting at its finest . This is a great little film . Its worth seeking out .
Spliced together PRC gem about an annoying American running around in Libya . Either you by its low rent silly charm and love it or you don't and hate it .	This gloriously silly " rah rah " America film was made right after the American entry in World War 2 . Its a wild romp with a jerk for a lead but enough jokes action and mismatched stock footage to be a great deal of fun in the right frame of mind . This is the story of Mike Malone an American reporter in Libya . He comes upon a plot of the Nazi's to arm the Arabs and fight the British . He steals a rifle and high tails it back to the nearest city . He crashes into the room of a nice " British " girl , leaves her the gun and then heads out the window , telling her to hide the gun from pursuing Arabs . Malone goes to the British consulate where he's thought balmy , doubly so after a visit to the girl turns up no gun . Malone then struggles to prove his story , while the British try to prevent the Arab uprising and keep an eye on the German in their midst . This movie is very funny , often for the wrong reasons . Malone , played by Walter Woolf King , is the worst an American be : cocksure , boorish , a jerk and insufferable . He's horribly unlikeable and comes close to sinking the movie , but he doesn't mostly because he's so over inflated as to be a joke . He is nicely counter balanced by the rest of the cast who are damn near spot in their portrayals of what should be cardboard characters . Clearly they are going to go for it even if the buffoon in the middle isn't . I have to single out Harry Parke aka Parkyarkarkus , as a guy from Brooklyn posing as an Arab razor blade salesman . Parke is a joy to be hold as a calm cool man of action and witty remarks . Clearly he knows whats going on even when everyone else doesn't . The character of Parkyarkarkus was Parke's patented character from radio and he's basically doing the same shtick here to great effect . ( A side note : Parke , real last name Einstein , is not only known for fathering Super Dave Osbourne and Albert Brooks , but also dropping dead in Milton Berle's lap during a Friar's roast of Lucille Ball ) . Technically this movie is a mess . Clearly shot on stages and back lots , it also makes a great deal of stock footage , none of which matches any of the other footage in the film . It makes for a " bigger " movie but often surreal effect as in the case of a bar room brawl that suddenly is in a room three times the size it started in and involves ten times more people . Its funny for all the wrong reasons . And I really liked this movie . There is something so loopy about it that made me like it infinitely more than I should have . Its not a great movie but some how the plot is involving and the knowing humor takes enough of the edge off the crappy parts that you really don't mind its low rent birth . Worth a bucket of popcorn and a soda . if you're in the right frame of mind . if you're not .
very good	The story of a French family and what they did during the war . The story of love , lust , and being Jewish in the wake of the Nazis and the years that followed . This film I thought might give me a little trouble , I did not expect to have the ending have me weeping , especially when the early part of the film seemed to be going in clichéd fashion . Told in color flashback with modern day black and white intrusions this is the story of a son trying to find out what happened with his parents in the war . I want very much to discuss what actually happens , actually I'm dying to discuss the film with someone who's seen it , but the power in the film is watching how the people act and react and then finding out what the title is really all about . If I had known what the deal was going in I doubt very much it would have affected me the way it did . As I said the early part of the film seems to be laying out a typical story of life during war time for those on the Nazi hit list . I was pretty sure which way it was going to go so I was kind of half paying attention . And then some things began to happen , and a very loud " oh no " came from my lips . And then I suddenly realized that what I was seeing was not what I thought I was seeing . Suddenly I was paying close attention to what I was watching . . . and then the final bit of sound and film said so much I found myself crying , not uncontrolled sobs but flowing tears as I was moved by what had just happened . Its not a great film , but it is a very good one . Its a story of the sort that has not really been told before . Its a story that puts real people back into the tale of the holocaust , something that hasn't happened in a long time . ( frankly we've gotten lost in the ideas when we tell the story and we've forgotten the people which I think is one of the reasons more and more people doubt this really happened ) . Worth a look at some point .
Nifty mystery thriller is almost like watching a novel	During a masked party Stephen Kester is found dead in the closet of his room , three stab wounds in his back . Suspicion falls on everyone at the party , especially Kester's granddaughter and her fiancée who fled the house after disabling all of the other cars and cutting the phone lines . As the police investigate they are shadowed and helped along by a mystery writer . Good Long Island based murder mystery novel keeps you guessing until almost the end of the film . Its not until a few knots about motive are untangled that you'll know who did it and why . Its a neatly plotted mystery that I think works better for lifting some of the dialog from the novel since it seems to move the film along at a good clip , even if most of the actions are simply in wide circles around the mansion . The cast is full of B-movie stalwarts who all fill their roles with a good amount doubt as to their possible guilt or innocence . Even nominal lead Charles Starrett as Michael Tracy , the mystery writer , manages to keep you guessing as to whether he did it or not . A solid and very enjoyable mystery . It maybe light and fluffy but it will entertain you .
Lots of fun-more so if you know all the Disney fairy tale cartoons	Disney pokes fun at itself and makes a glossy fairytale in the process . Animated princess is banished to the real world by a wicked queen , where its hoped she will stay forever . However the not too bright price follows suit as does a wicked henchmen . As the characters try to find each other and their way back romance blooms and the wicked queen fumes . I liked this movie . It helps that I've seen most if not all of the Disney fairy tales that are being sent up so the jokes played a little funnier . For example I loved the princess calling for help from her furry friends to clean the apartment and having rats , cockroaches and pigeons show up . The cast is mostly good , with only Idina Menzel , Tony winner for Wicked , being not really up to the material . She plays Patrick Dempsey's fiancé and seems off ( as she often does on film and TV ) . Definitely worth a look , especially if you've seen all the Disney fairy tales , mores o if you've seen them more than once .
Very good look at Welles the man , his relationship with Hollywood and unfinished projects	This is a loving film essay on Orson Welles and his unfinished films . Its an interesting look at the man who was just trying to make the films he wanted to on his own terms . Made with the assistance of Welles ' longtime companion Oja Kodar this film lets us see a number of his unrealized projects for the first time . Its a treat for anyone who has been interested in Orson Welles and heard stories of these lost treasures ; or for any one curious to what end he was putting the money got from his numerous film and television roles . While I'm not sure what I would have thought of some of the films ( The Dreamers for example ) I find that I'm very interested in where he was going with other ( his Moby Dick , which consisted of him simply reciting passages from the book is an interesting idea ) . I especially loved some of the short humorous bits that Welles put together , his Churchill film is very funny , as his is bit with two English tailors . As a person who has been very critical of Welles of late , due in large part to extreme disillusionment with his Don Quixote ( which I found to be a crashing bore ) I find that this film re-awakened my respect for the man . Its not a perfect film , most of the pieces we see only awaken a desire to see more of the unfinished films and at times it seems to go on too long . Still this is a must see if you're interested in Welles or cinema , especially its lost treasures .
Don't let the fact that the people behind Howard the Duck made this movie scare you away , this is one creepy little movie that will haunt you	This is a creepy creepy film . Its part HP Lovecraft , part Night of the Living Dead , part Cabinet of Dr Caligari . The plot has a woman recounting the tale of why she is in an asylum . The story begins with the woman going to find out what happened to her estranged father . They had communicated with letters , however as time went on they got stranger and stranger before stopping . Even before she arrives in the town she runs into some decidedly odd behavior , once there things get completely crazy with the dead coming back to life and all hell breaking loose . I was hesitant to try this movie because because the people behind Howard the Duck made it , but I was pleasantly surprised , this is a scary film . Essentially the ravings of a " mad " woman this movie manages to walk the fine line between real and unreal in such away that you get sucked into her story and are left wondering at the end if its real or not . Either way I was let creeped out and had to put on a light comedy in the hopes of making it so I could go to bed . In someways I'd have to put this on the list of great forgotten horror movies of the 1970's . It isn't perfect . The opening song is very odd choice , effective in some ways , but odd . Its suffers from a certain cheap almost amateur feel that many b-films from the period had . They take away , ever so slightly from the sense of dread especially when you've seen as many of these things as I have . Flaws or no this is really worth seeing , preferably not when you're all alone late at night since it will leave you with a creeping sense of unease that will make bed a scary place to be .
Classic Sex and Gore Fest	First off this film is pure exploitation . This is sex and violence and really gross , even by todays standards . Its not the best film ever made , but if you want gore and worms and gross things with your beautiful naked women this is for you . This film belongs in the exploitation hall of fame . A very bare bones explanation of the plot has a beautiful woman having an affair because she is bored with her husband of a couple of months . She wants to run off with her lover , who is also married , but he won't go . Getting out of her car on a lonely stretch of road she finds a phone and calls her husband who's cab driver . While she is waiting she is raped and killed by two guys . The husband uses the services of a black magician he once saved to get revenge on the killers and the lover . Its gross fun from that point on . The sex is early on as we see the very beautiful wife naked in the shower and having sex with her lover . Proving that this is exploitation at its finest we have a slow motion topless jog along the beach . This film has a reputation for being gross out royalty and its nice to report that this certainly is the case . This is a film that will have you going " yuck " quite often . Done before CGI this film is helped by knowing that what you see is what you get , people really are spiting up insects and such . The problem for me was that it seems oddly paced . Don't get me wrong the plot moves , but at times it seems a bit talky , which is odd since what you see is what you need to see and hear . See this film . I rated it as a , but thats for most people who want to see a gross out horror film from overseas . For hardcore exploitation film fans or those who love gross effects this is a classic and should be .
I liked this odd little film adventure	Story of a cursed jeweled snake that when has the potential to make the possessor invincible . The snake is hidden in a burial crypt in a pagoda in Hong Kong . When thieves try to steal it , killing someone in the process , the owner knows that a great evil is in the land . Sending his son to London to marry , despite his protest of wanting to stay and find the men behind the attack , the battle for the snake heats up . In London the son meets his half brother , a rich man who is half Chinese , who has designs on the snake . The battle between the brothers becomes a struggle for control of the world . This is a yellow peril story that is more akin to a Fu Manchu story then the mysteries that are the norm in the Edgar Wallace series . Actually it isn't surprising since Wallace was the man who came up with the story for King Kong , so a tale of high adventure is right up his alley . This is a very good little film , not just because it breaks with the conventions of the rest of series , nor just because it's a ripping yarn , but the film is unique in that while all of the characters are likable , most of them are not wholly nice . Our hero is roguish and almost rakish , his father is willful and clearly possessing a past of darkness , his brother is charming as well as villainous , the heroine is at times almost mousy , her sister a bit too self centered , and the girls ' father is a shady business man who will do anything to keep himself afloat including offering up the girls . No one is spotless , except perhaps for the hero's antique loving friend . It's an interesting group of people and it makes the film have a great sense that anything can happen at any time . More than worth a bowl of popcorn and a soda .
Hey , This is Pretty Good	Up until the commercials that ran a couple of days before the opening everything I was seeing of or on this version of the Punisher made me think this was going to be horrible . Still not wanting to waste my cash I waited and then when two key opinions said it was a good film I decided to try it . And despite all my misgivings I have to say that this is a very good film . Is it the Punisher ? Occasionally . There are times when it has the gritty sense of violence that the comic had . Unfortunately at others it has a humor that doesn't quite work with the explosions of violence . Its not bad , it just comes across as the film not knowing if its real or not . A case in point the battle with the Russian that leads into the torture of David . There are also key problems with the adaptation in that too much of the back-story is removed ( Castle , at least early on , was suppose to be dead to the world , here everyone knows he's still alive - - - and easy to find ) I freely admit I was wrong about this film and while I think its a good film ( ) I will withhold saying that its a real version of the Punisher .
One of the greatest war films ever made	I needed to have two hours and twenty odd minutes to watch this with out interruption . I didn't want to break it for any real reason or for any real length of time other than to change the disc ( more on that later ) . I had the time so I watched the movie . I could argue that with two small flaws this is one of the greatest anti-war films ever made . This is the SUBJECTIVE story of a boy who joins the partisans during the German invasion of Russian and his decent into hell . This is a tough movie . its in your face and everyone else's , literally as we see everyone and everything that our hero does even to the point that if he's talking to someone the camera will hold on them as they speak with no cut aways . We learn everything about people by their faces since we have the time to study them . This is simply one of the few times where even if the film had had a different aspect ratio other than 1 . 33 ( tv shape ) I would rally to have it full screen rather than letterbox simply because for this movie you MUST lose yourself in what you see and hear . Having someone facing you , looking at you is more powerful when all you can see is their face . Faces are a landscape in this film . This is especially true of Floyra , our hero who's stunned expression at all that happens around him is a constant source of wonderment . As we as shocked and rattled by what we see we know that he is even more rattled because he is there and he is expressing it on his face . Its said he was hypnotized to be able to get the right expressions , and seeing the pain on his face I believe it since you could only express what he is by living through it . . . Wide eyed numbness his mouth sometimes agape we watch as he tries to just get on . . . The film as I said is subjective and we see and hear , literally , what Floyra does . When his hearing is thrown askew by shelling what we hear becomes less distinct . Sound will drift in and out and we get a sense of being there . The camera also holds on some scenes at times Not cutting away for better angles simply because Floyra doesn't have them . This film will rock your world and then some . I want to tell you everything about the film but at the same time fear that doing so will set up expectations as to what happens . Reading the material on the film and seeing the trailer set up some expectations in my mind , some of which was right and some was wrong . I would like to have you see the film knowing as little about what actually happens as possible so you experience the film straight . I lost my expectations the minute the film began and I was wondering what was going on . . . I was hooked as the long strange trip took over . I'm certain that once the film stats you will be free of expectations too but , at the same time I think if I told you too much it would ruin the what happens next . This is GREAT film making . That said there are two small flaws . First , as some reviews have said the Germans , when they finally show up on screen are just a tad cartoony . menacing but slightly cartoonish . . . I could be wrong . . . but regardless through it all Floyra's pained expression cuts the cartoon away and reminds us this is bad stuff going down . The second flaw is a montage of actual footage used near the very end . I know why it was done , or can guess , but its too long . It breaks the spell in some ways . . . I think it would have been more apt had the film had the original desired title of " Kill Hitler " . The last point I want to make is the fact the film is on two DVDs . Released two years ago there is no logical reason for the film to be broken into two parts , the tape is a single cassette release , except that like many films from the Russian Film Council its loaded with subtitles , 13 languages and three audio options . There is also other extras like an introduction by the film maker that runs 20 minutes , documentary footage and an interview with the lead actor . But I digress . . . . I'm certain that the film doesn't really need to be in two parts for any reason other than a technical one . . . except that in a strange way the break sort of works for the film if you watch it straight through taking only a break to switch discs . Call me crazy but the break is perfectly placed at the mid point to the story . Not only that the film changes from first half to second half . The tone , even though continuous in action , is different as the second disc begins . Its almost as if we are back at the beginning of the film at a peak that slowly slides downward . Time wise the two halves are different with the action taking place over a couple of jumbled days while the second is one continuous series of events over two days . In the end all that matters is the film . And here the film is absolutely great . See it and be moved . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - random thoughts In its way its comparable to grave of fireflies The film that many people compare it to , Destiny of a Man , is a relation but not direct ancestor of it simply because the films are very different , Destiny taking place over years in Flashback , Come and See is happening here and now over weeks . They share themes and elements but the thrust and points are different , especially in the end . . .
Simply the words that sent the US to war and made everyone think it was the right thing to do .	Documentary consisting of nothing but statements from speeches and interviews from members of the Bush White House and its allies showing the march toward war in Iraq from just after / 00 to the start of the war . Its a damning collection of film that illustrates what many people always suspected , the war in Iraq was a long time in planning and they were going to manipulate everyone and everything to get us in there . What is so powerful is that its just the words that were used to manipulate th populace into backing a war that really should never have happened . There is no commentary only the ever changing words and stories that were told and believed . The effect is chilling . I'm sure its a film that will be studied for years to come . A must see because we need to know how we got here and so we're armed so it never happens again .
One of the best Disney films in years	Trying to figure out when the last time a movie from Disney proper charmed me like this , not sure . I love the Hefalump movie and I'm a fan of Treasure Planet - though once Martin Short shows up I think it goes off the rails . Hefalump aside ( Thats a TV movie on the big screen - so I'm dismissing for purposes of comparison on that technicality - though its easily one of my favorite Disney films ) I think this probably the one film from the Mouse House I'm happiest with since Lilo and Stitch . Is it the equal of Lilo ? no it doesn't have the " This is my family , its broken but still good " moment that makes me cry every time - nor , and most importantly it does not have the bra wearing caped crusader ( though there are moments and lines . . . ) What the film has , that most other Disney films don't , and which is the reason that Lilo , and Treasure Planet and the other really good films work , is the characters . Lets face it this movie is about characters - and how they interact . The plot - the time travel to the future and stop the baddie plot , isn't all that great , but the pieces are - all of the jokes , and emotion and everything else comes out of the people in the film . yes they are people , even the frogs and the t-rex and the hat . They created personalities for everyone and everything in this film . Thats why the film works . You're in a place with real people , there are no cookie cutter characters , there are different people , not ones a dog , and ones a chicken and ones a fish or a pig like in Chicken Little . ( which has moments - and two or three real characters ) . No one is a stereotype or if they are they bend the rules - the bowler hat man is typical Snidely Whiplash characterization , but its turned on its head - things are not what you think they are with him . I loved that they dressed up what you expect with things you don't - the twist of who the Robinsons are-what you can't guess ? - twist Rules that you would expect from old time travel movies to make a new sort of sense . Frankly the plot is disposable - but the people are not . the lines of dialog are not . I would love to know what was cut out of this film-65 % of it was apparently removed and re-shot-I'd love to know what was there ( Hello DVD ) - what gems might it contain . I'm guessing the film was more rambling - probably like Robots . I loved this movie , I've been thinking about it since I saw it , which is unheard of on a Disney film-more importantly I'm not remembering the jokes , but the people and the sets and the gee whiz feeling I had . I really want to see it again .
Classic simplicity	Wonderful short film from Bill Plympton . The plot is simple a fan and a flower fall in love . To say more than that would spoil one of the most charming animated films ever made . Told with simple black and white lines this is a film that will move you . Its a simple tale told perfectly . I know when the film ended I was upset that it didn't continue on . The wishing of that was pure greed on my part since the film is exactly as long as it needs to be . there are no grand flourishes or showy pieces . Its simple economy . See this film . More importantly see this film with some one you love since in its way it will say more about how you feel then words can express
Low Key Thriller of the Highest Order	The President's daughter goes missing and a very quiet manhunt is set in motion . Dragged into it is Val Kilmer a very good agent , who is like pit bull that won't let go of a task and is willing to do anything to complete an order . This thriller is going to either thrill you or make you crazy . The whole film is from Kilmer's point of view , we never see anything he doesn't see , we never go anywhere he doesn't go which makes for a very stripped down thriller . I think it works in spades and then some , never knowing more than our hero assures that we will never be ahead of him in any real sense . Of course we can suppose whats going on off the screen simply because this is a movie and we know things must be going on elsewhere , but what we suppose may not be right or important to what is happening before us . This is a hard movie to write about briefly simply because its focus doesn't leave much room to do so with out spoiling the mystery . Despite the fact that I think this is one of the best films so far in 2004 , I have to be honest and say that its not without its flaws . I can't talk about them either with out ruining something . To me the flaws are meaningless since the film is such a great ride it doesn't matter . See this movie . It deserves to be seen and find the audience that its theatrical run failed to generate . Its one of the best and most unique thrillers in years .
Wonderfully Depressing	This is one of the best movies I've ever seen . . . . I never want to see it again . Why don't I want to see it ? Its simply depressing . I can't watch it with out becoming suicidal . This is the story of two ill fated lovers over the early and mid part of the 20th century . Its told in flashback in a fishing village in Canada . What can I say ? This is a film of great performances and moments , the firestorm in Dresden gives me nightmares . I would love to recommend the film , but its ultimately so bleak I don't know many people who would want to see it . Still I give it simply because it provokes such a deep reaction in me .
