Badly in need of film restoration is this grainy print . . .	Perhaps the low rating is due to the atrocious print shown on TCM of this ten minute short produced by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and narrated by Cecil B . DeMille , who took no credit for his services . The murky print barely has time to dwell on any of the film footage it uses from various films . The screen actually turns white during a segment from Laurence Olivier's HAMLET , the blotchiest of all the film clips used . Equally murky footage from famous films like MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY and other historical epics makes the short almost unwatchable . DeMille's commentary is obvious , not enlightening , and the whole short subject looks like it hasn't been restored since it was made more than half a century ago . It's hard to believe the Academy hasn't bothered to restore it by now or that a better print wasn't available to TCM . Not worth commenting on , really .
Stunning Korngold score but disappointing in every other respect . . .	Having heard for years that THE CONSTANT NYMPH was one of Joan Fontaine's favorite performances and knowing that Erich Wolfgang Korngold wrote the score for it , I looked forward to the film with much anticipation when I finally had a chance to see it . Unfortunately , aside from good performances from Charles Boyer and Alexis Smith , I found Miss Fontaine's Tessa just too cloying and simpering to be realistic . I thought she played the awkwardness of youth much better in LETTER FROM AN UNKNOWN WOMAN , a really much more solid and forceful role . Tessa just seems to be a girl inordinately fond of a musician who doesn't realize , until too late , what the girl means to him . Oddly enough , the scenes between Boyer and Alexis Smith are more developed than any of the quieter scenes between Boyer and Fontaine . Smith makes the wife a sympathetic creature because her jealousy is easy to comprehend . An altogether disappointing film aside from a glorious score by Korngold that leads to the final concerto where he fully develops the love theme for Boyer and Fontaine . Unfortunately , most of the sets for the country scenes early in the story look like painted backdrops so that one never gets the feeling that Tessa's environment is a real one . Nor does the story give Joan Fontaine ample opportunity to fully flesh out her character since she is missing from much of the middle portion of the film . For a great Fontaine performance , I suggest viewing LETTER FROM AN UNKNOWN WOMAN with Joan at her best .
So bad , you have to see it to believe it . . . makes Ed Wood look like the master of suspense . . .	The only distinction here is seeing BELA LUGOSI in a color horror film - - or , I should say , in a horrific B-film photographed in a process called " Natural Color " that makes anything Ed Wood did in the realm of horror look like Masterpiece Theater . The silly script has a woman in a morgue recalling how she got there and therein lies the only novel idea in the script . How actors like GEORGE ZUCCO , DOUGLAS FOWLEY , NAT PENDLETON and JOYCE COMPTON got talked into putting this one on their resume is anybody's guess . The script is a complete misfire from beginning to end , nothing is ever explained and there are loopholes galore in what one can make of the convoluted plot . A green mask keeps appearing in a window for no discernible reason until a weak explanation comes late in the story involving a blindfold and a man's vengeance when betrayed by his wife . Sorry , can't recommend this to anyone except " bad movie buffs " who have to see any horror film ever made , no matter how bad . Appalling dialogue is never for a moment believable and neither NAT PENDLETON nor JOYCE COMPTON are given comic material that offers any relief .
Rival newspaper reporters have stormy romance . . .	There isn't anything in THERE GOES MY GIRL that hasn't been done before in screwball comedies of the ' 30s and ' 40s . This has the feisty ANN SOTHERN playing a game of oneupmanship with would be hubby GENE RAYMOND , both of them cheated out of getting married by their scheming boss RICHARD LANE . The story is absurd , the plot contrivances are everywhere , and it's just a matter of time before Sothern and Raymond are able to tie the knot by using physical restraint on Lane to keep him from interfering with their nuptial ceremony . It's old hat stuff given a little too much zest from pert ANN SOTHERN , at her feistiest , and GENE RAYMOND , trying hard to be a comedian but not exactly a master of disguises . His French accent is a disgrace . Newspaper stories were quite the fad in the ' 30s and this is just another one of those fast paced comedies that makes absolutely no sense when you stop to think about it . Other stars , like Rosalind Russell , Jean Arthur , Claudette Colbert , Irene Dunne and even Bette Davis , did similar screwball newspaper stories but with much better scripts .
Horrid little British B-film is a waste of time . . .	This is about on par with the lowest of the Monogram films that the U . S . produced during the ' 40s - - however , it's a British B-film with little to recommend it . Holmes is played by sharp-featured Arthur Wontner ( who bears somewhat of a resemblance to Basil Rathbone ) and Ian Fleming is a suave version of Dr . Watson . Unfortunately , Lyn Harding is a very unimpressive figure as Professor Moriarty . The story taken from " Silver Blaze , " left me uninvolved with its racetrack background . The TCM presentation begins with an announcement that the film has been restored , but you'd never know it . The soundtrack is poor with much of the British dialog unintelligible and the scenes themselves are murky and poorly photographed . I lost count of how many times Wontner says , " Elementary , my dear Watson , " but let's just say this will never rank as one of my favorite Sherlock Holmes stories . Summing up : A feeble exercise in mystery that seems longer than its one hour and six minutes .
Time has blunted the shock appeal this had originally . . .	Time has dulled the sensational aspects of a story daring to mention " panties " in a courtroom trial about a man accused of murder because a man attempted to rape his wife . LEE REMICK is the woman about whom we never really learn the truth , JAMES STEWART is defending the man on trial for murder , and GEORGE C . SCOTT is the relentless prosecuting attorney whose cat-and-mouse game with Stewart forms the heart of the film . Indeed it's the inside look at the strategies of a defense and prosecuting attorney that gives the film its real strength , because we are never quite sure about the outcome of the trial . ANATOMY OF A MURDER is directed in stark , cold , clinical fashion by Otto Preminger with a jazz score background punctuating the sleazier aspects of the story . Frankly , it's not a film I ever warmed up to - - not then , and not now . It does have compensations in its excellent , crisp B & W photography and in watching pros like JAMES STEWART and GEORGE C . SCOTT hold the screen with dramatic courtroom confrontations , but the story seems slick and contrived , based as it is on a pulp novel by John D . Voelker that had built-in mass marketing appeal because of the sensational ( by ' 50s standards ) aspects of the unsavory story . It seems a dull thing today , not helped by a running time well over two hours .
Bland performance by Frances Gifford in key role ruins the impact . . .	FRANCES GIFFORD had one of the best roles of her career as the troubled wife of lawyer GEORGE MURPHY in THE ARNELO AFFAIR , but the director fails to get more than worried looks and a coma-like expression that she wears most of the time - - while looking very beautiful . Facially , she bears a strong resemblance here to Donna Reed . She's a woman who feels neglected by her busy husband and falls prey to the flattery of a womanizing man ( JOHN HODIAK ) who later kills a woman and sets up Gifford as the murderess . Only through the keen detective work of a doggedly determined officer ( WARNER ANDERSON ) and the gradual realization of her husband that she's been seeing Hodiak , do the deceptive Hodiak's schemes fall apart as clues are unraveled . EVE ARDEN , as a dress designer friend of the heroine , has her usual quips but none of them are particularly inventive . It's strictly a B-film that has all the MGM gloss but falters because of a weak script and a poorly directed actress in the leading role . Miss Gifford gives a bland performance in a role that calls for more than close-ups of a fixed expression . Hodiak is fine as the cunning predator and nine year old DEAN STOCKWELL is lively as Gifford's loving son . GEORGE MURPHY is unable to do much with the role of the neglectful husband , a thankless role that he plays in stolid style .
( POSSIBLE SPOILER ) . . . An interesting failure . . . unsolved murder mystery remains a riddle . . .	The question that hangs over the opening scenes of THE WEIGHT OF WATER raises a puzzle in the viewer's mind : What has the past murder of two women got to do with the present occupants of a boating party who are revisiting the scene of the crime ? Events keep shifting back and forth between past and present , as a photojournalist tells her husband that she wants to do further investigating on a murder that took place in 1873 . The other guests on the boat include a poet ( SEAN PENN ) and his wife , his brother and his girlfriend ELIZABETH HURLEY . Penn seems to have his eye on his brother's flirtatious girl . The handsome , more carefree brother is played by JOSH LUCAS . Each time the events switch back to the 1870s , we learn more and more about the inhabitants of the small cottage where the murders took place . SARAH POLLEY is a hard-working housewife whose husband takes in a boarder ( CIARIN HINDS ) who immediately lusts after her , telling her that his rheumatism needs massaging from her . But as the plot thickens , the link between past and present never becomes clear . After a savage murder has taken place in the cottage , she blames him for the crime and is responsible for his hanging when she testifies against him . A storm at sea threatens to take the lives of those aboard the boating party - - but even though the surf is rough , they manage to survive the storm after a brave attempt to save the life of ELIZABETH HURLEY results in the death of SEAN PENN , whose wife has been jealous of the attention he pays to his brother's girlfriend . But still , the weak link with the past events of murder fails to connect to the present except that jealousy is somehow implied . It's a curious film - - with perhaps some deep meaning lurking beneath the story's surface , but the characters in the present aren't really fleshed out as well as those inhabiting the past . In the past , we learn what really is supposed to have happened that night in the small cottage by the sea . But then a disclaimer at the end of the film tells us that the murders were never actually solved and there is still doubt remaining as to what did really happen . Impressive performances by SARAH POLLEY , CIARIN HINDS and SEAN PENN stand out in the memory when the film is over . But it's a curious piece of film-making , disjointed in its use of flashbacks to cover the past and failing , ultimately , to make sense of what happens in the present . Summing up : An interesting failure without plausible explanations .
Moderately amusing MGM short built around Jackie Cooper . . .	MGM may have called itself the studio with " more stars than there are in heaven , " but this little short with JACKIE COOPER as the centerpiece of attention as a child star , surrounded by the studio's impressive list of contract players , features a lot of " stars " that today's fans are totally unfamiliar with . That studio slogan was only appropriate when we talk of MGM during the ' 40s and ' 50s . Sure , people will recognize the lovely Norma Shearer , Clark Gable , Wallace Beery and Jimmy Durante , but are unlikely to know who's who when Anita Page , Reginald Denny , Marion Davies , Charlotte Greenwood and Polly Moran arrive for Cooper's studio birthday bash . Nevertheless , it's an amusing slice of film history and guaranteed to satisfy the nostalgic feeling a lot of us have for the pre-Golden Years at Metro .
Grim melodrama is badly dated , grim look at the downside of human nature . . .	Time changes everything , even the way we look at movies that were once so esteemed . Nothing about THE INFORMER is subtle . It's all told in the broadest way possible - - even Max Steiner's score only punctuates the dismal feel of the whole maudlin story . Victor McLaglen is " the informer " in Dublin during " the troubles " ( when weren't they in trouble ? ? ? ) , and it's quite a melodramatic turn he does here as the brute of an Irishman who drowns his paranoid feelings of guilt with any drop of whiskey available , in what was to become a typical Victor McLaglen hard-drinking trait in many a John Ford film . Wallace Ford is the friend he squeals on ; Una O'Connor is the mournful mother of the dead man who does a complete turn at the end of the film and forgives her son's killer in the film's most implausible and contrived moment ; Preston Foster is the Commandant in charge of finding out the name of the informer ; and Heather Angel is the girl whose brother has been killed . J . M . Kerrigan does a good job as the little hanger-on of a man who praises McLaglen as long as he has money to throw around after the foul deed - - a sad commentary on human nature . But for a film that has been acclaimed for years as a John Ford masterpiece , it is no such thing . It's a trial to watch with some of the dialog so over the top into cornball territory that you won't know whether to laugh or cry . The script has a simplistic view of the Irish Rebellion of 1922 and their troubles and the film's ending is more laughable than poignant . McGlaglen is either tipsy or staggeringly drunk through the entire performance , much as he is in many a John Ford film - - except that here he was an awarded an Oscar for his performance . I suppose it's an Irish trait that can't be denied - - but Ford's insistence on magnifying the drinking habits of his traitorous protagonist gets a bit wearisome before the story is half told . By today's standards , not the classic it once was . The soundtrack makes scant use of Max Steiner's score which won an Oscar as did John Ford's direction .
Claudette on a chicken farm with Ma and Pa Kettle as neighbors . . .	How often have you heard the term , " The book was better than the movie " ? Well , you'll hear it again from me , since Betty MacDonald's book was much more than the conventional slapstick comedy it has been turned into , using only the cleanest episodes from the racy novel to appear in this sanitized screen version where even the studio stage mud looks sparkling clean . It's been turned into a typical CLAUDETTE COLBERT / FRED MacMUARRAY vehicle , given another angle on " the other woman " down the road , and the troublesome neighbors with their earthy ways have been turned into Percy Kilbride and Marjorie Main , given the only true comic episodes that have any merit . Whatever , the film was pleasant enough for some because it did become a popular success at a time when " city couple trying to live the country life " was not a theme that had worn out its welcome . Here it's more like a one joke theme , with Claudette falling into the mud when dealing with pesky pigs or confronting a troublesome stove that does everything but work . A few funny , episodic bits with the Kettles is about all you can reasonably expect to enjoy . In fact , they became so popular that a whole series developed around the Kilbride and Main caricatures . Mildly entertaining and good for a few laughs but no great shakes as a comedy .
Dates badly . . . preachy and artificial . . . should not have won the 1947 Oscar . . .	Hollywood loves to give Oscars to films of social significance or British imports that have intellectual appeal . They had a chance in 1947 to award an Oscar to the British-made masterpiece , " Great Expectations " , from the Charles Dickens novel . Instead , they opted to give their gold award to a preachy , artificial film about anti-Semitism that has me wincing when I watch it today . Some films improve with age , like good wine , but " Gentleman's Agreement " now seems bland and obvious , not the effective , earnest and gripping film it was meant to be . Gregory Peck gives an earnest performance but Dorothy McGuire's character seems naive and poorly defined . Celeste Holm gives an ingratiating , witty performance but hardly one that seems Oscar-caliber . ( Martita Hunt , who played Miss Havisham in ' Great Expectations ' wasn't even nominated ! ) Seen from the distance of time , it's a film that dates badly in its attitudes and its attempt at giving us a strong viewpoint about the ills of anti-Semitism . The only vital character is June Havoc , as Peck's Jewish secretary . John Garfield is surprisingly bland in a supporting role . The whole film has a preachy attitude that never develops any real dramatic conflict . In addition to the bland script and leisurely pace of the film , there is not even praise one can give to the ordinary black and white photography or set decoration . Production-wise , it looks as if Zanuck was watching the budget , not expecting the " controversial " film to be the hit it was at the time . Just shows you what time can do to a story of social significance . The award should definitely have gone to the more distinctive " Great Expectations " , David Lean's British masterpiece . Hollywood gave many of its awards in the coming years ( and still does ) to great British films but , surprisingly , they shunned the David Lean film . Trivia note : To give it a documentary feel , there is almost no background music at all . Alfred Newman must have been busy that year working on his very dramatic score for " The Snake Pit " and opted to use almost no music for this one .
A few musical highlights but this is the pits for plot and acting . . .	THE FABULOUS DORSEYS is , as Maltin says , " a limp musical " , largely because neither JIMMY or TOMMY DORSEY can act their way out of a paper bag and the screenplay is hardly an inspired piece of writing . The most ingratiating performers are JANET BLAIR and WILLIAM LUNDIGAN , supplying the love interest as members of the band , and at least add some necessary glamor to the proceedings . SARAH ALLGOOD and ARTHUR SHIELDS are the Irish parents of the boys , who had a fighting relationship since childhood . The film depicts how this temperamental nonsense continued into their adult life as band leaders who argued about everything , especially music . Only after their father dies and Blair schemes a way to get the band leaders together again for a concert , does the story reach a reasonably happy ending . We get snatches of some of their song hits , including the memorable " Green Eyes " and " Marie " , and Bob Eberle and Helen O'Connell get to do their thing with a song , but the swing music isn't enough to compensate for a thin , contrived plot line . Furthermore , the print shown on TCM was pretty rough around the edges , no better than a third rate Public Domain print . Summing up : The Dorseys deserved better than this .
Sugar-coated trifle with sweet ( rather than sexy ) Taylor . . .	ELIZABETH TAYLOR's fans are really the only ones who will find any reason to watch CYNTHIA , a sugar-coated confection about a sickly girl churned out by MGM for the fast developing teen who was turning into a woman almost overnight . Here , at fifteen , she's still got a lot of her girlish charm , exhibits a modest singing voice ( is that her ? ? ? ) , and portrays a girl who's so fragile that her parents hold her back from doing anything more strenuous than going to the corner store . Ironically , it foretells Liz's own lifelong struggle with illness . GEORGE MURPHY and MARY ASTOR are her rather stern but loving parents and JIMMY LYDON is the boyfriend who gives Taylor her first screen kiss . S . Z . SAKALL is her encouraging music teacher . It's all very downbeat without a sense of humor , too straightforward in the telling for its own good . Unimaginative and more of a B-film than anything else .
Disastrously bad movie is dull and depressing . . .	It's too bad THE LONG NIGHT couldn't have been a short one . This is a disastrously dull movie with HENRY FONDA and BARBARA BEL GEDDES both playing implausibly motivated people who fall in love at first sight . Fonda plays another one of his " everyman " roles but is more of a lost puppy than usual in this depressingly dark noir directed without his usual style by Anatole Litvak . The first twenty-five minutes had me wanting to switch the movie off , it was so poorly constructed . I found it impossible to watch the whole thing . If any kind of film noir is your thing , you may stick around to see the whole movie . I found it a frustrating waste of time and certainly not a film that Fonda or Bel Geddes should be proud to have on their resume .
Poor Kay Francis suffers and suffers in another potboiler . . .	This is one of those KAY FRANCIS weepies that was so popular with audiences in the ' 30s ( don't ask me why ) . She suffers because she falls in love with an unethical Spaniard ( RICARDO CORTEZ ) who falls madly in love with her while her husband is away in India . Her foolish husband didn't want his wife to join him at his post in India because there would be too many hardships for her . The silly guy sends her off to Paris where she falls in love in " the city of love . " Attired in gowns that must have seemed luxurious and fashionable in the ' 30s , Francis has a hard time stirring much sympathy in a poorly written role . The first half-hour of the story is hard to get through but things pick up somewhat once she joins Cortez at his lavish and remote hideaway in Spain - - where he is ultimately murdered by a man seeking vengeance for Cortez's dalliance with his daughter . Kay Francis , in the meantime , has written a confession to her husband that she is in love with Cortez , but must now attempt to retrieve the letter before hubby reads it . The last twenty minutes contain a surprise or two that saves the whole story from sheer banality . The final twist is the only saving grace of a hackneyed storyline . Summing up : For Kay Francis fans only . Others beware .
An overstuffed turkey , opulent but induces drowsiness after first 45 minutes . . .	If it hadn't been the tabloid headlines screaming about the love affair between ELIZABETH TAYLOR and RICHARD BURTON on the set of CLEOPATRA in Rome , it's unlikely Fox would have released this epic without trimming even more than they did . It still doesn't work . The trims were not enough and the film is a boring mess by the time it reaches the end of its first forty-five minutes . Let's face it , Elizabeth Taylor sounds like a shrill fish wife whenever her emotions show any temperament - - in other words , her vocal abilities are not good enough to carry the role of a woman who commanded all of Egypt with her willpower and determination and cunning . She's much better in other contemporary roles , but ill suited to play the Queen of Egypt . REX HARRISON gives the only full-bodied performance in the film and unfortunately he's killed midway and is missing from the rest of this gargantuan bore . Technical brilliance in costumes and sets cannot atone for a bad script and some lifeless performances from a large cast . Only RODDY McDOWALL emerges triumphant as Octavius ( probably one of his best adult roles ) , but RICHARD BURTON is another casualty as a supposedly impassioned Marc Antony . Cleopatra's eye-filling entrance makes a stunning cinematic treat , but Taylor in later years confessed that she was sick upon seeing the film at a premiere and has since confided that she hates it . I can understand why , even if legions of her fans still think it's one of the best things she ever did . Sorry , I just can't see it that way , much as I love Liz in her best work .
Vintage crime drama . . . give me " Public Enemy " any time . . .	Strictly a curiosity piece from Warner Bros . , this early crime drama with a sermonizing WALTER HUSTON as a D . A . , is so full of annoying and clichéd moments that it seems far longer than its 68 minutes running time . Everything about it is so dated , it's hard to recommend it as anything but a museum piece . ( Trivia note : DICKIE MOORE was one cute kid as the littlest brother ) . I never heard of CHARLES " CHIC " SALE before , but he makes an insufferable grandpa , the dad of GRANT WITHERS . " Blood's thicker than government pea coup " is one of his most clichéd statements . The opening scene has the family gathered for a dinner interrupted by gunfire . Seems that a man on his way to see the D . A . was gunned down by underworld gangsters . With the family witnessing the whole thing , the story turns on just when and whether the star witnesses will testify . Unfortunately , the bare plot outline sounds better than it plays . The sentiment is so thick involving gramps and the little kids and there are so many inconsequential moments with weak attempts at humor , that the whole story falls apart long before the predictable ending . Hard to see how William A . Wellman came to direct this weak early effort at crime drama , except for the brutal moment when NAT PENDLETON teaches GRANT WITHERS a lesson in gangster brutality . WALTER HUSTON is given to lots of sermonizing . " This is the fight of every decent man ! " so that the drama has all the subtlety of a sledgehammer . Summing up : Just a curiosity piece of vintage film-making but hardly worth a peek . It's the sort of tale given a much more dynamic , grown up treatment years later by William Wyler for THE DESPERATE HOURS .
Classic screwball comedy but not my cup of tea . . .	I'll admit that Hepburn and Grant give their all to this screwball comedy about a paleontologist ( CARY GRANT ) seeking a bone for his museum , who runs into an eccentric young woman ( KATHARINE HEPBURN ) and can't seem to do anything right from then on . It's rightly famous for the scene where her ripped dress causes confusion in a nightclub . But it's mostly a battle of the sexes between two equally stubborn people and I can only say that Hepburn's Susan drives me up the wall - - probably one of the most annoying characters she's ever played with all of her Hepburn mannerisms in full gear . Grant wears horn-rimmed glasses most of the time in effort to look like a handsomer version of Harold Lloyd . He certainly has comic abilities with screwball material . There's nothing subtle about the humor - - especially when the two are involved with keeping a baby leopard under wraps . CHARLIE RUGGLES and MAY ROBSON and BARRY FITZGERALD do their best to add some merriment to the proceedings , but the endless sight gags are standard for this kind of fluff and become a little tiresome when everything Hepburn does continues to backfire with disastrous results . Howard Hawks deserves credit for keeping things moving along briskly , but it's never been one of my favorite screwball comedies because none of the characters have a grain of common sense - - especially Miss Hepburn's madcap heiress .
Threadbare tale needs help from Guy de Maupassant . . .	Uneven is the key word to describe the overall effect of this anthology about the effect a dress tail coat has on the fate of its various owners . The film is overloaded with well-known film personalities but lacking in the sort of wit and sophistication that would have turned it into the sort of clever short story anthology that writers like Somerset Maugham , Guy de Maupassant or Edgar Allen Poe churned out . A standout among the stories is the one featuring EDWARD G . ROBINSON who needs the tail coat to attend the 25th Class Reunion with poignant and ironic results ; and almost equally effective is a sequence involving CHARLES BOYER , RITA HAYWORTH and THOMAS MITCHELL . But most of the stories ( there are five ) are of little consequence in the scheme of things and the film has a finale with the Hall Johnson Choir that is just short of ridiculous . Interesting that GINGER ROGERS and HENRY FONDA share an episode , the first and only time these two major stars appeared together on screen . But beware - - it's a shame more attention wasn't given to creating some really good stories for all these talented stars and character actors . Julien Duvivier's direction lacks the pace to sustain interest throughout . Trivia note : A section with W . C . FIELDS and MARGARET DUMONT has been restored and helps considerably in stirring up the flagging interest .
Slapstick showcase for Larry Semon bears little resemblance to the " Oz " story . . .	This WIZARD OF OZ is merely a frantic slapstick showcase for LARRY SEMON , apparently a silent comedian who is unknown to today's audiences and who died at a young age ( 39 ) . He had a hand in the production and even designed his own Scarecrow costume , but the film is a curio that starts with a toymaker ( again , LARRY SEMON ) who tells a little girl the story of Dorothy ( DOROTHY DWAN ) from Kansas who , it turns out , is heir to be ruler of The Land of Oz . But the story he tells has nothing whatsoever to do with L . Frank Baum's story as we know it from the ' 39 version starring Judy Garland . And this Dorothy is a grown-up young lady of 18 who bats her eyelashes and puts a finger to her lips in a coy manner as though signifying youthful uncertainty . The only connection to the Oz story Baum gave us is the tornado , the effects for which are very good for 1925 , and the combination of the Tin Man , The Scarecrow and The Cowardly Lion . OLIVER HARDY is the Tin Man ( before his screen partnership with Stan Laurel ) , SPENCER BELL , a black man , is the Cowardly Lion and LARRY SEMON hogs the whole show as The Scarecrow . The best I can say for Lemon is that his costume and make-up for the role is laudable . But the fragments of story used here are all over the map , the key to everything being the chance to have all of the performers involved in slapstick stunts . Only MARY CARR as Aunt Em is spared this indignity . There are a few well staged moments that one can appreciate but all in all it's a bit too much for any adult to watch and I have no idea what children thought of this bizarre exercise in slapstick comedy .
Good plot , bad script , dull characters . . .	GENE HACKMAN gives a virtuoso performance as a loner , a weird one at that whose character is never fleshed out because he can't bare to reveal himself to anyone - - not even the viewer . At least that's the limitation imposed upon him by the dull script . What could have been an extraordinarily fine suspenser , is turned into a slow-paced character study that only skims the surface of its protagonist who is an expert in surveillance but unable to connect with any of the rather boring individuals around him . The script fails to inject any of the other characters with life , so that we never get to know what makes anyone tick . Annoying ? Yes . Frustrating ? Yes . Enigmatic ? Too enigmatic for comfort . After nearly two hours of watching Hackman spy on a young couple and teasing us with the one sentence he is sure means they are afraid of being murdered , the script takes a different turn at the last moment and the audience at least gets a bit of a twist if it is still awake to face the denouement . Maddeningly slow with scenes that aren't even needed to fill in some awkward gaps in the screenplay , this could have been a tremendously suspenseful film under a director like Alfred Hitchcock with a writer like Ernest Lehman ( who did " North by Northwest " ) . But Scorcese has skipped all of the conventional ways of building suspense in favor of a semi-documentary approach that falls flat and fails to register in a gripping enough way to keep the story taut and interesting . Instead , his departure from the usual way of filming , is an exercise in tedium . This is the sort of film-making that became common in the ' 70s , a sort of audio version of Brian De Palma's BLOW UP , but not nearly as effective . What might have made an interesting story never reaches its full potential .
Primitive by today's standards . . . inferior to Hitch's ' 56 remake . . .	Hitchcock believed , with good reason , that his first version of THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH was " amateurish " ( his own words ) and felt he could do more justice to the story by giving it a modern remake with Bernard Herrmann's magnificent music adding dimension to the suspense . He even used Herrmann as a conductor for the Albert Hall concert sequence - - which is much more complex in execution than it is in this version and changed the setting for the story . In this version , however , that sequence is probably the most Hitchcockian of all the scenes in the movie with some clever editing touches . LESLIE BANKS and EDNA BEST are nowhere as charismatic as James Stewart and Doris Day in the ' 56 version . The opening scenes are crude enough to be laughable and Peter Lorre's villainy was much more refined once he understood the English language , instead of learning his part phonetically , as he did here . Furthermore , the shootout at the end is not only awkwardly staged but is undercut by the unrealistic sound effects of dummy bullets . Edna Best is less than convincing as a sharpshooter for that final scene . The whole rooftop scene is excruciatingly amateurish as a wrap-up for the story . Clumsy ending . And it must be said that all of the events leading up to the scene in the church tabernacle , are more than a little absurd . Hitchcock tried to get comic effect out of some of these scenes , to little effect . The strain shows . It's a story that cried for a remake - - and Hitchcock did a marvelous job of visualizing it as a highly successful vehicle for James Stewart and Doris Day years later in exotic settings and more realistic touches to the story with the villains not appearing like stock caricatures , but humanized . Summing up : Hitchcock was right to remake it as a much better film .
Early Ann Sothern film is good indication of her promise . . .	But the film itself is a dated trifle that passes the time pleasantly at a little more than an hour . ANN SOTHERN shows why her breezy charm worked magic on audiences and top-billed EDMUND LOWE , largely unknown today , is her leading man as a Hollywood director . The title tune gets a nice workout in the opening scene inside a movie studio while the plot is launched about a temperamental Swedish diva on the warpath about nobody leaving her alone ( a la Garbo ) . When she storms off the lot in a huff , guess who waltzes in - - ANN SOTHERN of course . " As long as she's Swedish , " says producer GREGORY RATOFF . So Lowe meets Sothern at a carnival and is convinced she'd make a good replacement for his Swedish diva . Sothern reluctantly agrees but says , " We'll never get away with it . " And , of course , the rest of the breezy romantic comedy ( predictable as it is ) is concerned with the transformation of Sothern into a Swedish actress and her romantic alliance with Edmund Lowe . It's a well-written , fast-moving comedy of Hollywood manners and morals and Lowe , Sothern and Ratoff manage to make it work . The youthful Miss Sothern is at her prettiest and has fun with her key role , Swedish accent and all . Summing up : Better than average comedy from Columbia , well worth watching if you're an Ann Sothern fan .
Where is John Ford when you need him ? . . .	Director William Witney is no John Ford . But it's doubtful that even the great Ford could have done anything with this lame western which has possibly one of the dullest screenplays ever written . Saddled with bad material , it's no wonder that AUDIE MURPHY finds himself floundering about in a role that's so poorly written , he never has a chance . The actor himself admitted to being a " no talent " when it came to screen acting , and here he really gets his chance to prove it . The only other respectable performance in the film is given by KENNETH TOBEY , usually Mr . Nice , here cast as the bad guy who wants to sell rifles to the Indians and ends up in a heap of trouble when Audie decides to single-handedly take care of the situation and put Tobey and his cronies out of business . It takes more than an hour to get to this situation and by that time it's doubtful whether anyone was left watching . Filmed in muddy color with some interesting background scenery the only thing to dwell on during long stretches of dull dialog , it's no wonder Murphy's career was in decline by the time he did this film away from his home studio , Universal . Unfortunately , a tragic plane accident took his life only a few years later .
Based on true-life story of killers Martha Beck and Ray Fernandez . . .	What should have been an expertly crafted thriller based on a true crime story , THE HONEYMOON KILLERS is hurt by bad direction ( LEONARD KASTLE ) , sub-par performances from the entire cast with the exception of TONY LoBIANCO as gigolo Fernandez , and totally unable to disguise its low-budget sets and what sounds like stock usage of background music by Mahler . The script itself is not that bad . It's an episodic look at the overweight Martha's connection to a Lonely Hearts Club , wherein she meets Ray , whom she soon finds is interested in all the wealth he can accumulate from the untimely deaths of his marriage-minded lonely ladies . She is soon helping him , disguised as his sister , but her jealousy of the other women in his life soon leads to murder and mayhem . It's a chilling tale , all the more so because it's based on truth , but the director has clearly been unable to make it more than an exploitation film that for some reason has developed a cult following . Even the well-known DORIS ROBERTS , as a flighty friend of Martha ( SHIRLEY STOLER ) , gives a performance that can only be described as overacted and more suited to a situation comedy . Stoler is expressionless and remote as Martha , but it's a pretty one-note performance . Only LoBianco gives an authentic touch to his performance . Summing up : Misses the mark by a mile .
The best of the worst . . . so bad you have to see it to believe it . . .	PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE is strictly amateur night at the movies . Taken as that , you can sit back and enjoy the inept acting , direction and staging of every scene - - a film obviously filmed on a shoestring budget and directed by the infamously untalented Ed Wood , Jr . If you saw ED WOOD with Johnny Depp , you'll have a special fondness for this atrociously put together film . You'll probably enjoy every minute of it ! Worst performers of all are VAMPIRA and THOR , although they have competition in that department from most of the cast . Only LYLE TALBOT as General Roberts and GREOGRY WALCOTT ( the male lead , as Jeff ) give what can be called professional performances . The rest of the cast sounds like they're reading their lines for the first and last time . The outlandish plot has aliens devising their ninth plan to control the earth by raising the dead and controlling them to destroy the evil earth people by some sort of advanced computerized system . BELA LUGOSI's footage consists of a few glimpses of him walking around in a graveyard while most of the other shots have an actor wearing a black cape subbing for Lugosi who died during production . There's a certain creepy atmosphere to all of the graveyard scenes enveloped by mist and dark lighting and amusement in watching VAMPIRA and THOR go through their paces with hands and arms outstretched , but the film is actually not as much fun as I anticipated . Too many of the scenes are played in a manner that takes itself too seriously and none of it is the least bit convincing . The acting , for the most part , is as cardboard as the sets . Summing up : Worth a look at least once , but hardly the camp classic that it has become . But by all means , watch Johnny Depp in ED WOOD . Trivia note : Some scenes will remind you of the " Flash Gordon " serial of the 1930s - - especially the dialog .
Possible Spoiler AheadRichard Dix and Fay Wray as film players in amusing Hollywood story . . .	RICHARD DIX plays a has-been western movie star who's romantically involved with FAY WRAY , whose stardom is on the rise , another variation on the " A Star Is Born " sort of theme . What makes this one interesting are all the behind-the-scenes looks at movies in the making with directors and script girls and lighting men doing their thing . When Dix gets a break to return to pictures in a gangster role , he walks off the set when the director decides to make him a cop killer . From then on , the fortunes of Dix and his sweetheart are on the downside and there's a sentimental sub-plot involving an avid fan , a young boy who idolizes Dix . However , all ends happily when Dix happens upon a bank robbery and becomes a hero by drawing a gun he intended to use to rob the bank himself . It's a bit of a stretch for the ending , but then nothing in the film bears much relation to reality . Low-budget film passes the time , nothing more .
Stilted acting , nothing original about the plot in this B-film western . . .	Columbia seemed intent on making B-films about westerns being shot in Hollywood and the behind-the-scenes glimpses throughout the story that are supposed to be a point of interest . Trouble is the script offers nothing in the way of real entertainment . BUCK JONES is a cowboy doubling for big western star GRANT WITHERS , a conceited hunk of muscle in love with HELEN TWELVETREES . Despite a name that makes you blink , Twelvetrees is quite forgettable as an actress and the rest of the cast is sub-par in that department too . Little DICKIE JONES ( he was the voice for " Pinocchio " in the Disney classic ) , plays a wannabee cowboy who helps get Buck Jones out of a jam when he's mistakenly thought to be part of a bank robbery . Everything is straightened out for the last reel , but by this time most viewers will find the whole tale mighty predictable . The bit with the airplane and the dramatic attempt to get the gangsters from flying off in their plane is about as far-fetched as anything else in the story . I reckon you can skip this one without missing anything .
Anita Ekberg out of her depth as a femme fatale . . .	ANITA EKBERG almost sleepwalks through her role of a disturbed woman who somehow finds herself in the midst of murder and mayhem in SCREAMING MIMI ( ' 58 ) , the title referring to a statue that is some sort of fetish that turns up at every killing . Miss Ekberg is also a statue here , towering above most of the cast except for PHILIP CAREY , the handsome male lead who shares one thing in common with Anita - - he's a lifeless presence . It's hard to get involved with these characters , especially since the story itself is a murky enough affair with some psycho-babble underpinnings in the convoluted storyline . On the plus side , the B & W photography of rainswept streets and dark shadows is impressive and the production aspects aren't too shabby . GYPSY ROSE LEE manages to be lively enough as a nightclub proprietress , but her shimmy to " Put the Blame On Mame " is a pretty sorry attempt at the song made famous by Rita Hayworth . The story starts out on a promising note , but quickly becomes an inept psychological thriller under Gerd Oswald's routine direction and moves toward a conclusion that lacks whatever punch it might have had because much of the disclosed information was already revealed . This is an easily forgotten item that capitalizes solely on ANITA EKBERG's physical charms which are an eyeful for male fans but her acting is sub-par for a story that requires much more from an actress than mere physical presence and an overly generous bosom . She was much more fortunate a few years later to find herself in " La Dolce Vita " . As for PHILIP CAREY , his stone-faced approach to acting doesn't help matters here . Summing up : Hopelessly confusing and dull , when it should have been tight and suspenseful .
A sugary confection . . . too sweet for words . . .	Sorry , but HOUSEBOAT has all the charm of a sugary half-hour sit-com stretched out to feature length . Wholesome and sexy-looking SOPHIA LOREN in real life was a total turn-on for CARY GRANT ( he wanted to marry her ) who probably insisted that she be his co-star in this little romp . But the result is a predictable romantic comedy with an annoying song ( sung by Sophia ) that is just as cliché-ridden as the script . Too bad these two co-starred in another little disaster called THE PRIDE AND THE PASSION - - sounds like a description of their on again / off again stormy love affair in real life . Once the scene shifts to the houseboat , the atmosphere is claustrophobic rather than cheery and you keep wondering how long it's going to take for Grant and Loren to realize they'd be happy together . Grant was maturing nicely by the late ' 50s , but I wish he'd been paired with more mature actresses beyond their twenties , since Audrey Hepburn and Sophia Loren seem much too young for him . It would have been nice to see him make a film with someone like Olivia de Havilland - - who , like Ingrid Bergman and Deborah Kerr , would have made a more suitable romantic partner on screen during the ' 50s . The kids remain non-entities , the humor is forced , the situations are just silly - - and yet , there are some who find this harmless fluff to be highly enjoyable . I didn't . Summing up : Passes the time but only Grant's most loyal fans will want to see it more than once .
Quirky and original . . . effective sci-fi mix of comedy and horror . . .	At least KATHARINE ROSS is more effective here than she was in the dreadful THE SWARM ( performance-wise ) , but once again she reminds me of the robot-like performances Jeanne Crain used to give in earlier days with the same kind of model perfect beauty . The same kind of detachment too , although here at least she suggests an inquisitive mind at work . And no wonder she's inquisitive . She never saw women more dedicated to housework than THE STEPFORD WIVES who seem fixated about using the right detergents and being " perfect wives " for their hubbies . Being an independent sort of liberated woman , she resents all this conformity . The film is really a spoof on women's lib , with strong feminist leanings thrown into the screenplay and can't decide whether it's a sci-fi horror film or a downright comedy , but manages to be both . Certain lines and situations had audiences giggling at the goings on . As two of her best friends who also show some degree of independence until they become Stepfordized , PAULA PRENTISS and TINA LOUISE are effectively cast , especially Prentiss who has some of the film's most caustic comments and observations to make . She easily takes the focus off Ross ' more conventional , low-key role . Whether you enjoy this on the level of a comedy or a sci-fi horror film , it's another clever tale from the pen of Ira Levin ( ROSEMARY'S BABY ) , not quite as chilling but certainly more fun to watch . PATRICK O'NEAL does a nice job as the head of an evil institution who plays a big part in the stories ' strange outcome .
Her charm was still there but the stories were wearing thin . . .	REBECCA OF SUNNYBROOK FARM owes whatever charm it has to its leading lady ( SHIRLEY TEMPLE was still the number one box-office attraction in America ) and a modest but pleasing supporting cast . However , it's obvious that nobody paid much attention to the original story and what we're left with is a rather threadbare story mixing Shirley with her show biz talent background . And along the way , Bill Robinson gets lost in the shuffle of background characters , with only William Demarest enlivening the proceedings with his pratfalls and Helen Westley with her grumpy old maid . Edna May Oliver must have been busy . Aside from the star , GLORIA STUART does nicely as a leading lady for RANDOLPH SCOTT - - the two make a handsome pair . Stuart never got her big break in these sort of films but was certainly a stunning blonde in her day with very fine features . Scott seems a little standoffish , not cast in his regular western mode , perhaps even a little uncomfortable in his scenes with Shirley . Shirley has a change of hairdo ( away with all those curls ) but just to make sure her audience won't pine for the good old days , she delivers some of her old song numbers with customary ease . It has to be noted , though , that her singing voice ( although on key ) was always very slight indeed . She fares much better in the few tap routines she does , always with that big smile and cheery presence . Not one of the best Temple films , but OK . Franklin Pangborn is fun as a nervous stand-in who gets his big chance and blows it .
Combat in the sky . . . on Air Force One no less . . .	As action thrillers , go , AIR FORCE ONE has enough of a plot to keep you watching closely as terrorists take over the presidential plane , a sleek beauty of a craft that makes a gleaming set piece for this kind of adventure in the sky . And who is better qualified to take care of things than HARRISON FORD , somewhat less impressive without that hat and familiar stubble as Indiana Jones . ( Well , maybe KEVIN COSTNER who was originally slated for the role ) . GLENN CLOSE makes a very commanding presence as the Vice President , seemingly never at a loss in moments of distress , and GARY OLDMAN handles his Russian accent and menacing villainy with his usual aplomb . It's just that if you stop long enough to take a breath while all the action is going on , you might see that underneath all the fancy pinnings this is regulation stuff that's been time countless times before - - and sometimes with better results . The cast is impressive with WILLIAM H . MACY and DEAN STOCKWELL on the prez's team and Jerry Goldsmith providing another one of his dependable , if unmemorable , action scores . And although Wolfgang Petersen does a nifty job of directing , turning the president of the U . S . into an action hero performing stunts that seasoned stuntmen must have been hired for , does stretch credibility a good deal for the climactic moments when airborne peril is at the max for a cliffhanger ending . Not bad as an action thriller , but just don't expect it to be any more substantial than a sleek new video game .
Vignettes in search of a plot . . . typical Allen fluff . . .	HANNAH AND HER SISTERS is a series of vignettes about family relationships - - successful in some ways , overly familiar when Woody Allen gets into his hypochondriac spin . Handsome photography of New York City , fashionable interiors and exteriors and a cast of pros , makes it all easy enough to take - - although I was never a fan of his interior and overlapping dialog which gets to be distracting enough without the undertone of music blasting away on the soundtrack . The MICHAEL CAINE / BARBARA HERSHEY romance is nicely sketched and played in a natural manner by both stars who share common interests although she's happily married to MAX VON SYDOW . MIA FARROW is an actress who loves to surround herself with family and friends at the dinner table rather than concentrate solely on an acting career as a stage actress . Not a big stretch for her - - with art imitating life . It's the kind of Allen film that has Woody and his technique written all over it . If that's your kind of thing , you'll like it , regardless of the fact that it's , at heart , very light stuff and rather insignificant . The flaws are well hidden by lots of good music on the soundtrack and occasional flashes of humor in Woody's doctor visits resulting in his interior dialogs wrestling with his latest X-rays . " Don't panic . Don't panic , " he tells himself before resorting to - - you guessed it - - panic . His quest for religious faith is also good for a few chuckles . It goes on and on in a rather disjointed manner - - again , typical Allen style - - but fans of his films should find this one a bit more likable than most of those he did in the ' 80s - - and the cast is pleasant enough to watch despite the familiarity of it all , with MIA FARROW essentially playing herself . DIANNE WIEST is the daffy sister struggling to express her talent either in the theater or in her writing and has some amusing scenes with Woody as he comes to appreciate her . But , in the end , none of it really makes much of an impression so it's hard to justify the awards and nominations . Must have been a bad year .
Devilishly funny take on one of man's worst fears . . .	GEORGE O'HANLON plays " everyman " Joe McDoakes , alarmed by the fact that when he showers he notices he's losing his hair . Right then and there , he decides he has to do something about his predicament and he seeks the help of professionals to correct what he thinks is a fate worse than death . Naturally , nothing really works . And , of course , no mention is made of the fact that genetics has a lot to do with this particular defect . But the comedy goes from one funny incident to another without taking a breath , so it's breezy fun all the way and you have to wonder how it's all going to turn out . Just one of many episodes in the series directed by Richard L . Bare about Joe McDoakes coping with everyday problems ( and usually losing in comic fashion ) , an amusing series that accompanied the double bills of the ' 40s and generally provoked a few chuckles or downright laughter with varying degrees of success .
Amusing . . . but sugar-coated and only skims the surface . . .	Fans of Bette Davis will surely appreciate watching her talk about the subject dearest to Bette - - herself . As with most actresses , like Katharine Hepburn , for instance , it's a subject that truly fascinates her . But somehow , I get the impression she was less than benevolent toward her co-workers . She's entertaining to listen to as she recounts the stories behind the films she made - - well , some of them - - but there's lots of material that she never dares touches . The bitter feuds with Miriam Hopkins and Joan Crawford , in particular , are never detailed , nor are all the nervous breakdowns she gave her directors . The most interesting of her co-stars is Olivia de Havilland , who admits to being frightened of Bette during their first two films , with Bette " only warming up to her " by the time they did IN THIS OUR LIFE . Bette retorts with , " Oh , you were always so damned pretty . " De Havilland also reveals how Bette's flare-ups could be frightening , as when she lit into a technician fussing with the lighting . William Wyler adds an amusing anecdote and Anne Baxter seems to have relished playing opposite her in ALL ABOUT EVE . But it's what isn't revealed here that could have made the whole thing a little less sugar-coated than it is . I read recently that when Ruth Roman was asked whether she would ever do another film with Davis ( after BEYOND THE FOREST ) , she simply said , " I'll pass on that . " There are many actresses who swear they would never do another film with her - - and even sweethearts like Helen Hayes and Lillian Gish couldn't find a kind word to say about her behavior on the set of films she made late in her career . Presumably , she was less than benevolent during the last decade of her life . She also found fault with de Havilland for " upstaging " her at an award ceremony in Paris . Still , fans will get a sense of her independent spirit and strong will from watching this recap of her career .
Horror classic has to be judged by today's standards . . .	Time changes everything . Once upon a time Dracula , the stage play , was a sensation that starred BELA LUGOSI as the blood-thirsty man in the cape who thrilled theater audiences with his chilling portrayal . He's still chilling in the screen version Tod Browning directed and there's plenty of creepy atmosphere to keep you riveted to the story . But there are also plenty of faults . The opening scenes are a lot more cinematic than what follows once we leave the castle and the story starts dealing with Mina ( HELEN CHANDLER ) and Jonathan Harker ( DAVID MANNERS ) at their residence . It then becomes almost completely stagebound , with static movement of story and characters so that you know you're watching a museum piece from the ' 30s . The horror is so diluted by the stagey slow-talking dialog ( sound was new and actors were told to keep their speeches slow so every word could be heard ) . It's an almost silent acting approach to the whole thing . BELA LUGOSI is very menacing in his huge close-ups but is guilty of stage acting all the way through . DWIGHT FRYE makes a very intense and enjoyable Renfield , although he too is guilty of extravagant overacting by today's standards . The cobweb atmosphere is dark and appropriately scary and the B & W lensing of the story is very impressive . But , as stated above , you have to take it for what it is - - a primitive telling of the great story handicapped by its faithfulness to the stage version . It ends rather abruptly as Harker and Mina ascend the stairs and Van Helsing tells them he'll be along soon . Fadeout . The End . Much too abrupt . Modern audiences are bound to feel cheated by the less than thrilling ending . Summing up : Flaws and all , still an interesting experience mainly because Lugosi and Frye keep it watchable .
Typical " good for a rainy day " sort of Neil Simon comedy . . .	Fresh-faced JANE FONDA in another one of her ditzy ingenue roles ( before politics did her in ) and ROBERT REDFORD reprising his stage role as the overwhelmed lawyer coping with a hyperactive wife and a five story walk-up in Greenwich Village , are the stars of this Neil Simon comedy that remains bright and cheerful despite an inclination to get a bit tedious about the walk-up jokes . The amorous young honeymooners soon find themselves battling over all the things that can go wrong when cooped up in an apartment where nothing really works and the windows need fixing and - - well , you get the drift . The girl has a mother ( MILDRED NATWICK , repeating her stage role ) , who is just as ditzy as her daughter but a little more timid about relationships . And then we have the attic neighbor ( CHARLES BOYER ) who charms the mother and flirts with the daughter . It all begins to wear a little thin before the resolution in time for a happy ending , but there are a few delightful moments ( such as Redford actually running barefoot in the park ) , and all in all it's a satisfying comedy if you can put up with all the exaggerated humor .
Worth seeing for Garbo alone . . . but not without tedium . . .	I watched this for the first time on TCM with an original musical score by Michael Picton and was fascinated by the score and Garbo's stunning appearance . I'm not a Garbo fan and some of her films are really hard to enjoy by today's standards of film-making ( and acting ) , but this one is watchable enough even though it drags occasionally . It's gorgeously photographed and Garbo is given the royal camera treatment . In fact , she's treated royally by everyone except the man she loves who discovers too soon that in matters of love , she has a strange code of conduct . Well worth viewing if you're a fan of Garbo's films . Otherwise , you may not make it to the finale since it's rather overlong for such a simple story . Handsomely produced . Antoneo Moreno is interesting in the male lead .
Sweetly sentimental as a Hallmark card . . . but well done . . .	This is a handsomely produced tear-jerker , nicely played by MAUREEN O'HARA , RICHARD THOMAS and ANNETTE O'TOOLE and obviously aimed toward the Christmas market with a sweet tale about a mysterious Christmas BOX residing in the attic of an old lady's mansion . Maureen O'Hara is still a pleasure to look at and listen to in the role of a rather crotchety , firm-minded elderly lady who is in need of household help and accepts Thomas and O'Toole , along with their young daughter , when they apply for the job . Thomas needs the extra money to run a ski shop but is not exactly fond of O'Hara and her ways . It's his daughter , Jenna , who eventually does establish a bond with the woman and more revelations soon come about with respect to the mysterious Christmas box in the attic and O'Hara's past . It's strictly sentimental stuff , so be advised that the pace is on the slow side as the character revelations are gradually made clear . But if you like warm-hearted tales of Christmas ( or any of the holidays for that matter ) , you can't go wrong with this one . Summing up : Handsomely produced with fine performances , well worth viewing .
Lily Pons hits some nice high notes . . . that's about it . . .	The very concept of HENRY FONDA ( the " aw shucks " guy from the sticks ) as the husband of an opera singer ( LILY PONS ) is a weak idea that must have posed quite a problem for the scriptwriters . You have to wonder how audiences accepted this idea way back then because Fonda's youthful image was strictly the unsophisticated farm boy type . But that's not the only improbable thing about I DREAM TOO MUCH . The slight story is silly ( as most musicals of the ' 30s were ) , and enjoyment of the film will depend entirely on whether or not you like to hear Miss Pons give out with her flute-like operatic voice on several well chosen arias . She certainly had an amazing vocal range and her rendition of " The Bell Song " from L'Akme is a highlight of this otherwise rather ordinary film . ERIC BLORE is there for a few standard comic routines and you can even catch a glimpse of LUCILLE BALL as a tourist in one of her early roles at RKO . But there's nothing much one can say about the film itself except that it gave audiences a chance to hear why Pons was such a favorite at the Met for a period amounting to something like thirty years . Otherwise , it's strictly routine stuff as romantic comedy , coming to life only when Pons sings .
Children scarred by war have morbid fascination with death . . .	My title comment sums up what one is left with after viewing FORBIDDEN GAMES . No more , no less . A sad commentary , of course , on war and what it does to people - - or as is the case here - - to children . BRIGITTE FOSSEY and GEORGES POUJOULY give two of the least self-conscious children's performances I've ever seen , their faces in close-up resembling all the innocence and guilt of childhood in a world where grown-ups go about their business without imparting any knowledge or real communication with children . Their morbid fascination with games involving putting crosses on the graves of dead animals is what their whole existence has come to in war-torn France of 1940 . Most of the story takes place on a peasant farmhouse swarming with flies and decay as life and death situations come to the forefront of the plot . At a time when the neo-realism of certain filmmakers was very much " the thing " among the movie-going public of the ' 40s and ' 50s , it's easy to see why FORBIDDEN GAMES won a Best Foreign Picture Oscar . But it really deals with the sad situation children were in during the war , no more , no less , without making any profound statements or giving us more to ponder than what happens within the confines of a very slim story . All of the peasant characters ( some rather eccentric ) are well played and the children are magnificent . But on the whole , it's a rather downbeat treatment of a depressing theme and the kind of film you really have to be in the mood for . The abrupt and very downbeat ending is not very satisfying .
An early mixture of " Ben-Hur " , " The Robe " and other biblical epics . . .	Although never entirely flawless , THE LAST DAYS OF POMPEII ( ' 35 ) was an ambitious undertaking for RKO to take at that time . The storyline , about a bitter blacksmith who turns gladiator , is really a morality tale wrapped up in biblical settings and given the usual " cast of thousands " publicity by the studio that spent a lot of money in recreating Ancient times . PRESTON FOSTER was never a particularly charismatic actor , often accused of being " wooden " , but there's a sincere element about his performance here that allows the film to work . So too does BASIL RATHBONE , giving some extra dimension to his take on Pontius Pilate . Interesting to catch a glimpse of WARD BOND as a gladiator - - an actor who has appeared in so many classic films it's almost amazing to realize he was kept as busy as he was . With Max Steiner supplying the score , it's a lesser known gem that makes for enjoyable viewing even if it comes off as a cross between BEN-HUR and THE ROBE and lots of other stories dealing with the effect of the crucifixion on men's lives and their search for the truth .
As a Halloween slasher , it delivers the goods . . .	The Michael Meyers figure in the mask is more sinister than ever in this better than average remake of the original HALLOWEEN movie . It's a slasher that has enough real thrills for anyone who wants to see the gore and many plot twists and turns . DONALD PLEASANCE is still Dr . Loomis , alerting the police that Meyers has escaped and is back in Haddonfield looking to murder his niece , DANIELLE HARRIS . Harris is a wonderful child actress who looks genuinely frightened throughout the story and convincingly goes through the paces , as do all the other members of an excellent cast . ELLIE CORNELL and SASHA JENSON do well as the conventional teen-aged leads . If slasher films of this genre are your thing , this is a better script than you might expect from this franchise . On the other hand , if you've seen the original film with Jamie Lee Curtis , there's an awful lot of familiarity in the plot line . But as a Halloween slasher , it delivers the goods . Summing up : Probably one of the best sequels in this series .
Primitive western film was a trail blazer . . .	It's almost impossible to review a twelve minute western made in 1903 from a modern standpoint and a knowledge of all the western classics that would follow . But since director Porter had to work with primitive technology , his little film still impresses today . A touch that seems inspired is having the gunsmoke and occasional spurts of dust tinted red , as well as the final shot aimed at the screen ( something Alfred Hitchcock may have borrowed for one of his films ) . Briefly told , it's the simple story of a train robbery that is almost successful until the four men are hunted by a posse . A stationmaster is shot and tied up , while outside his window we see a train moving into the station - - a wobbly special effect ahead of its time . The little girl who eventually removes his binds is amusing in the way she uses silent screen technique to indicate panic by looking upward with outstretched arms . Considering when it was made , it's astonishing that the director / cameraman / writer was able to do what he did here .
Keaton goes to college . . . just like Rodney Dangerfield would later on . . .	BUSTER KEATON , in his silent film comedies , was a forerunner of the type of comedian later embodied by the clumsy antics of WOODY ALLEN or RODNEY DANGERFIELD . This is especially true of COLLEGE , in which our hero is a man who wants to impress his sweetheart with his athletic abilities - - and seems to fail miserably . It's a theme that was handled with a bit more finesse years later when Dangerfield went BACK TO SCHOOL ( ' 86 ) and tried making his own distinct impression . But Keaton , of course , has his moments even if they aren't the most inspired bits of nonsense in his repertoire . The plot is simple enough - - he has a girlfriend who prefers brawn over brains and is insulted when he blasts athletics in his graduation speech as the school's brightest bookworm . He follows her to college and intends to prove he can handle athletics as well as books . Most of the gags that follow are not as screamingly funny as they're meant to be - - mildly amusing is what I made of most of the film . And the politically correct will not be wild about his impersonation of " a colored waiter " . Sorry , but there was too little plot to really engage my interest and I was bored long before the rowing crew ending . I definitely enjoyed Buster more in some of his other outings . Nonetheless , we do have Keaton and Chaplin today , as Robert Osborne pointed out - - and both of them have their following and cult status among a lot of the younger viewers . It's just that COLLEGE is not among Keaton's best work , in my opinion .
Another tall revenge tale from Harold Robbins - - western style . . .	NEVADA SMITH is a long-winded revenge tale encompassing chapters in a man's quest for revenge . The first chapter is the most interesting - - with BRIAN KEITH showing " the kid " ( STEVE McQUEEN ) something about handling a gun as a gunslinger should who's looking to avenge the killers of his parents . As the killers - - MARTIN LANDAU , ARTHUR KENNEDY and KARL MALDEN - - give tough , gritty performances and each is slated to be avenged for the killing of Nevada Smith's parents . But the last half of the film sags under the tacked on spiritual saga with RAF VALLONE preaching the Bible to " the kid " , who promises to " keep it in mind " before he goes off to find the third man , KARL MALDEN . It's all directed in typical Henry Hathaway fashion - - ruggedly staged action against gorgeous scenic backgrounds . It's a role that suits STEVE McQUEEN as perfectly as any of his best parts . He's especially good in the early segment as the uneducated kid who comes under the tutoring of BRIAN KEITH as Jonas Cord . The swamp scenes , where McQueen gets himself sent to prison so he can locate Arthur Kennedy , almost seem like segments from another movie he made with Dustin Hoffman - - PAPILLON . HOWARD DaSILVA and PAT HINGLE play the brutal warden and his helpmate in brutal fashion . SUZANNE PLESHETTE is rather unlikely as a doomed native girl in an underwritten role . Summing up : A revenge tale that could have been trimmed by at least 30 minutes to make a tighter western .
Darkly amusing coming of age , Czech style . . .	I'd heard about this film for years and knew it won the Academy Award in the U . S . A . in 1967 as Best Foreign Film of that year , but only recently did I catch up with it . I won't say it's great - - it's a good comedy of the absurd , done in grand style with a wonderful cast of actors doing justice to the sly comedy inherent in every scene . VACLAV NECKAR is the novice station attendant and JOSEF SOMR is the randy supervisor with his mind on anything but trains , even CLOSELY WATCHED TRAINS which might be carrying German ammunition . The humor is a constant factor in the slowly developed story and you get a sense of how the Czech countrymen felt about the Germans during the early days of WWII . The coming of age aspect is concerned mainly with Neckar's " premature ejaculation " problem - - one that he almost commits suicide over - - which is a rather strange aspect of a tale meant to be taken as absurdly hilarious . I'd have to say the film has been over-hyped as " great " , although I found it sufficiently entertaining but dull in spots . Photographed in crisp B & W , it's one of the better foreign films of this period but I think the praise has been too extensive for what is essentially a one-note comedy about a boy's obsession with what the doctor calls " a normal occurrence " that is cured - - predictably - - by a mature woman who understands his problem . The final explosive scene with the German ammunition train being blown up - - and the wind machines blasting away at the station - - is a satisfying but odd conclusion to the story for reasons undisclosed lest I spoil your enjoyment of the finale .
Cynical western with an ironic ending . . . nothing is what it seems . . .	Poor RALPH BELLAMY . During the Golden Age in Hollywood movies of the ' 30s , he was always the man who loses the girl in the final reel . Here he is in his seventies , still at the losing end of his " unlucky in love " predicament , sending a bunch of mercenaries on a mission to rescue his " kidnapped " wife ( CLAUDIA CARDINALE ) . Cardinale is also a loser here . She comes into the film past midway and then indifferently performs her role of a Mexican woman ( with an Italian accent ) . But BURT LANCASTER is in crackling good form here , dispensing some witty lines with his usual finesse . ROBERT RYAN , usually so good in western roles , looks weak here - - and physically ill , in the least demanding of the male roles . JACK PALANCE is excellent , his Mexican accent never sounding forced , and WOODY STRODE leaves a quietly strong impression as a man good with the bow and arrows . LEE MARVIN is a commanding presence too - - in fact , he and Lancaster are what hold the cast together from beginning to end . But there's no new territory explored here . It's a well photographed western with some occasionally interesting music from Maurice Jarre , who opts for silence most of the time even when some strong background music would be appropriate . What does set the film apart from the usual western is the ironic ending , the kind that has you wondering how it will all turn out because we find out toward the end that the mission is not quite what we thought originally . I'll leave the details out so you can enjoy the movie on its own terms . Summing up : Not bad , but it gets a bit too philosophical in some of the quieter moments and somewhat too talky leading to dull stretches . Richard Brooks should have trimmed the running time since he wrote , produced and directed the whole thing .
A landmark among horror films ? ? ? . . . I don't think so . . .	THE EXORCIST was a novel I read years ago and never saw the film , disliking the novel too much . Not even all the hype about the movie could make me interested in going to see it and stories I heard about people getting sick from the shocking reality of the fright scenes . Now I've seen it on AMC ( with all those annoying commercial interruptions ) , and I see that I wasn't missing anything . It starts out painfully slow ( for a film regarded as a landmark among horror films ) , and only vaguely begins to suggest what is about to take place in the girl's bedroom . ( It's based on the true story of a boy's possession , not a girl's ) . I guess they figured it would be racier if a girl was involved . ELLEN BURSTYN is the worried mother who is told her daughter has a chemical imbalance in her brain after the girl appears to be deeply disturbed by something . Of course , none of the doctors can explain why her bed was moving convulsively up and down - - the first tip-off that this is indeed going to be a horror film . It's almost an hour into the movie before the girl's first big attack comes on and she has to be sedated . By that time , I felt like I had already had a tranquilizer myself . But from this point on , as medicine fails to pinpoint the girl's illness , the mother turns to the local church for guidance and the story begins to exploit the theme of possession . LINDA BLAIR is highly effective in her manic attacks and those around her seem to be in real danger of the demon possessing her . It's only until the middle of the movie that the word " exorcism " is even used by a doctor who suggests that the mother consider using it to rid her daughter of the spirit . The main shock appeal of the story ( which made the book such a best-seller ) begins as soon as Father Damien ( JASON MILLER ) begins the rituals - - which , unfortunately , takes until midpoint in the film . By that time the viewer has mainly been treated to various glimpses of Georgetown and some pretty autumnal photography and a couple of cozy scenes with LEE J . COBB as a detective interested in a murder that took place near the girl's home . MAX VON SYDOW's entrance into the film is an impressive one , cinematically , as fog drifts around the Georgian brownstone and he shows up to assist Father Damien . While it's the snail pace of the story that defeats the film from the very beginning , it's this very fact that makes the actual exorcism scenes more shocking by contrast . And they do have shock appeal . ELLEN BURSTYN's drab looking mother is hardly the vision of a movie star who could stir LEE J . COBB into asking for an autograph . She looks about as downtrodden and upset as LINDA BLAIR in all of her garish green-paste make-up . Sure , THE EXORCIST is a shocking story but it now seems obviously contrived to upset anyone who hasn't heard of the practice of " exorcism " as practiced by the Catholic Church . Here , director Blatty exploits his theme with professional polish and theatrical effect - - but it's still far from a landmark horror film , in my opinion . Why it became such a box-office smash , I've never been sure .
Deja vu is deadly in this " Groundhog Day " of repeats . . .	Not a bad little thriller with an interesting concept that doesn't always work , but still manages to hold the interest throughout . MIKE VOGEL is , for some strange reason , caught in a time warp of the kind seen before in " Groundhog Day . " But his time warp has him murdered - - over and over again - - in some very brutal style by some vengeful souls out to destroy him . Before midway we get some explanations - - something about " harvesters " feeding on his energy to restore themselves , like vampires needing new blood . The story has him involved with two young women - - JAIME MURRAY is Medea , a predatory female with a hidden agenda , and Christina COLE is his blonde girlfriend who turns up after each of his murders in a new setting , who gradually comes to realize the danger he's running from . There are plenty of loopholes in the confusing story but you won't have much time to think about them . There's plenty of action going on and enough plot twists to keep you guessing until the rather weak fade-out . Summing up : Better than average thriller filmed in Great Britain on the cheap . Vogel bears watching - - he's a good actor and deserves better material than this .
Notable only for all the local Hawaian scenery . . . a disappointment otherwise . . .	Perhaps the kind of role JOHN WAYNE should have taken a bit earlier in his career . The age difference between him and ELIZABETH ALLEN is really noticeably distracting here , but their constant squabbling and ribbing each other is pleasing enough to make the slight story entertaining - - at least for John Ford's staunchest fans . Otherwise , it's a case of scenery taking center stage over the actors for a picture postcard view of Hawaii . Aside from Wayne and Allen , none of the other principals have too much to do - - particularly DOROTHY LAMOUR who merely makes a few fleeting appearances wearing a sarong-like garment as in days of yore . Nor does LEE MARVIN get a real chance to play a substantial enough role . Ford lets his cast brawl with realistic fistfights and lots of physical stunts that must have kept an army of stuntmen on hand for some of the dirty work . CEASAR ROMERO is pleasant in a supporting role and JACK WARDEN , as Allen's father , injects humor into his character . Miss Allen is a surprise as the leading lady - - the aristocratic Boston society lady in stiff opposition to Mr . Wayne's brusque manners and brawling ways . She , of course , eventually melts and sees thing differently after she's been around awhile . Although her performance is fine , it's interesting to note that right after this film , she went back to a career consisting mostly of TV roles . Very lightweight entertainment that depends on its gorgeous scenery to keep you awake and interested . Certainly not the best of Ford .
Good western with big brawl for the climax . . .	Formula stuff , but entertaining story of bad man RANDOLPH SCOTT and good guy JOHN WAYNE brawling in lusty western style over Yukon saloon queen MARLENE DIETRICH in the 1800s , with Dietrich looking like a glamorized queen of the 1940s era . It's a tidy western directed by Ray Enright in good Warner Bros . style . MARGARET LINDSAY is pretty but merely decorative as Dietrich's rival for Wayne and RICHARD BARTHELMESS is shockingly aged looking as Dietrich's admirer . He's the one with the boyish good looks who began films in the silent period . You have to wonder what happened to him at 47 . It's a pretty thin story with a very predictable finish . As the bad guy , RANDOLPH SCOTT is stuck with a badly written role which has him assuming a wicked gleam in his eye and a sly grin - - but that's about the extent of his characterization . JOHN WAYNE has much more to work with and he fills the role to a T . Both men appear to be in their physical prime , as does Miss Dietrich . At any moment , I expected saloon queen Dietrich to do either a dance hall number or belt out a song in her own inimitable style , but no such thing . She has a straight dramatic role and never looks anything less than ultra glamorous or stunning throughout with never a hair out of place . The men have the tough roles and the big brawl at the conclusion must have kept the two stunt men busy earning their pay .
Laurel and Hardy and some pleasant musical interludes . . .	The basic premise of WAY OUT WEST is having the two boys ( Ollie and Stan ) attempt to deliver the deed to a goldmine to the rightful owner whose guardians are scheming to get it for themselves . Getting it into the hands of the proper person turns out to be the raison d'etre for the whole hilarious saga with the sort of sight gags the duo are famous for . The musical interludes , aside from the soft shoe number , includes a nice rendition of " Trail of the Lonesome Pine " - - but the interludes are widely separated by the slapstick routines that are as inventive as they are funny . Particularly amusing is the sequence using a donkey to hoist Ollie to a balcony - - with astonishing results . Stan Laurel does a ticklish scene with his laughter seeming like the real thing for an extensive bout with the lady trying to get the deed away from him . This sort of thing is sometimes carried to lengthy extremes but it still manages to be funny . Not my favorite of the team's work - - it seems more like an extended short than a full-length feature but it does provide some solid laughs .
Larger than life historical drama is more timely than ever today . . .	What makes KHARTOUM so relevant to today's world , is the characterization of The Mahdi ( LAURENCE OLIVIER ) as a religious zealot , a Muslim fanatic who wants to wage a Holy War against the infidels and keeps proclaiming himself with the words : " I am the Expected One . " Although this depiction of a true story is based on events that happened in the 1880s in the Sudan , it's timelier than ever when one connects the dots to Osama Bin Laden . And who doesn't ? It's another story in the grand tradition of all those Hollywood epics that dealt with the British Empire and its expansion of colonies with British soldiers engaged in desert warfare against fanatic enemies . CHARLTON HESTON sometimes lets his British accent slip , but gives a persuasive performance in the kind of role he was born to play , even if his motivations are never completely clear . As to why he even assumes such an impossible mission , one can only wonder when the odds were so stacked against him in what seemed like a hopeless assignment . However , he's always in full command of his role . So is LAURENCE OLIVIER in dark-skinned make-up and using a convincing accent that makes his character seem true to life , seeing himself as the chosen one to lead his tribe against British rule . The confrontations between him and Heston are well staged and both actors appear at their best in these highly literate scenes that reveal the depth of their beliefs . Frank Cordell's score is fascinating and Yakima Canutt's staging of the battle scenes adds a great deal to the authenticity of the desert battles . RALPH RICHARDSON is fine as Prime Minister William Gladstone , anxious to save the reputation of his country after a humiliating defeat , and RICHARD JOHNSON is excellent as Col . Stewart , the man assigned to accompany Heston to the Sudan . The screenplay is an intelligent examination of the events and deservedly won an Oscar nomination for Best Screenplay written directly for the screen . Tighter editing might have improved the lengthy film that runs two hours and fourteen minutes .
Amusing comedy has the Lubitsch touch . . .	JACK BENNY and CAROLE LOMBARD are ideally cast as a ham actor and his zany actress wife in TO BE OR NOT TO BE , a story of Poland facing the Nazi invasion and how a theater troupe gets to do some real acting by fooling the Nazi authorities . The real comedy highlight of the film is SIG RUMAN as Col . Ehrhardt , foolishly thinking that Benny is a loyal German involved in spying activities for the Fuhrer and afraid of showing any disloyalty to Hitler by telling Earhardt a joke poking fun at the Fuhrer . His scenes with Benny and Lombard are a joy to watch . ROBERT STACK plays the young pilot who always walks out on Benny's " to be or not to be " oration as soon as it begins , for reasons unclear to Benny . STANLEY RIDGES does a nice job as the real professor doing the spying for Hitler , the man Benny must impersonate with some hilarious results . Must have seemed way ahead of its time in ' 42 . Sadly , it was Lombard's last film . Shortly after filming ended , she went on a bond selling tour and was killed in a plane crash on her return to Hollywood and Clark Gable , her husband . Throughout , the direction is well paced and assured under Ernst Lubitsch's clever and light-hearted touch . Well worth watching .
Strange historical event during Civil War re " The Tennessee Plan " . . .	Seems that authorship of " The Tennessee Plan , " a strategy for cutting the Confederacy in half during the American Civil War , was conceived by a woman , Anna Ella Carroll , who claims that she delivered the plan to President Abraham Lincoln in confidence . Since Lincoln never credited anyone with the plan , it's unknown to this day whether her story is truthful or not . She goes before various committees over a period of twenty years or more and no conclusion is ever reached to verify her story . Lincoln was supposed to tell the nation when the war was over but it never happened . Interesting little short from MGM , it deserves to be seen , well acted and presented by MGM and narrated by Carey Wilson .
Puritan America's sexual awakening through Kinsey . . .	It never occurred to me that watching a film about Dr . Kinsey would be like watching a dry documentary about a fascinating subject . That's the impression one can get from the opening scenes - - but fortunately , the film improves as it goes on . The film is structured as a series of vignettes based on the sort of questions that were posed in the Kinsey Report which was widely read and published in the ' 50s - - and to some degree it works . We see how Kinsey himself came to regard sex and the study of it . JOHN LITHGOW is his puritan , uptight father ( " The decline of the Roman Empire was due to too frequent use of bathing " ) , revealed through questions posed by CHRIS O'DONNELL and TIMOTHY HUTTON as Kinsey workers being trained to ask the probing questions . LIAM NEESON has the title role as the professor with the bold teaching methods unafraid to talk about sex . LAURA LINNEY is the forthright student who encounters Kinsey at college and forms a relationship with him . She's a brilliant scholar , a free thinker with a profound love of nature . Unfortunately , watching some of the scenes unfold are like watching paint dry despite sincere performances by Neeson and Linney who hold the story together . The first awkward sexual experience between Neeson and Linney in marriage is almost painfully awkward and unsettling to watch . We realize while watching the early portions of the film that we were really in the dark about sexuality until Kinsey boldly brought forth talk about masturbation , homosexuality , oral sex , etc . , which all were taboo subjects that kept everyone in the dark until his study was released . Despite all the graphic sex talk , the film itself manages to be rather more dry than might be expected - - and preachy , at that , when dealing with the regulations that governed sexual conduct in the 1950s and long before we treated sex as candidly as we do today in the media . But it has to be commended for making a strong point about raising a significant question : What is normal ? Until " The Kinsey Report " came out , nobody had the foggiest idea , so enormous was his contribution . Everybody read the report to find out if they were normal ! We've come a long way since then . There's a lot to be said for the kind of enlightenment that came with " the report " that took most Americans out of the dark ages . But oddly enough , with all the sex talk , the film is largely non-stimulating . Too bad there weren't more scenes like the one between JOHN LITHGOW and LIAM NEESON when Neeson convinces his father to be a subject for his report . OLIVIER PLATT gives a good performance as a fellow scientist and all of the supporting roles are well played by a fine cast . Nice work by LYNN REDGRAVE as a woman who , thanks to Kinsey , realizes she's not the only woman in the world to experience Lesbian tendencies and find fulfillment with a woman . And PETER SARSGAARD is wonderful as the bisexual who shares a torrid kissing scene with Neeson . Summing up : Uneven film has many moments of truth leading up to publication of " Sexual Behavior in the Human Male " - - and later , an equally well read study of the female - - which became huge best-sellers and delivered a lot of folks from a life of ignorance about a topic dearest to their hearts .
Harmless little musical to watch on a rainy day . . .	Jack Carson and Ann Sothern are such capable professionals that even when they are cast in something like APRIL SHOWERS they are worth watching . Carson rarely got leading roles , except in the " B " film or programmer such as this one and Ann Sotheran was just winding up all of her " Maisie " roles at MGM to do this unpretentious little musical at Warner Bros . Together they're fun to watch as a married couple , a pair of show biz hoofers who give out with a song and dance patter when they're not having domestic troubles over the legitimacy of using an underage boy ( their son ) in their vaudeville act . It's all done in a formula way with no big surprises , no characters that are more than conventional and without the kind of production numbers that studios like Fox and MGM gave their musicals . And yet , with a nice balance between some serious drama and mostly lightweight singing and dancing , it's the kind of musical that's easy to take . The usual supporting players under contract at Warner Bros . are used to fill out the supporting roles , including Robert Alda and S . Z . Sakall . Carson and Sothern are both capable enough to make us believe this sort of thing could easily have happened and both of them have a nice way with a song and dance . Little Robert Ellis is very adept as their talented youngster . Summing up : A nice , unpretentious little film to watch on a rainy day .
Nice work by Sinatra and Fitzgerald . . .	FRANK SINATRA should dispense with the banter between him and guest stars like ELLA FITZGERALD and just concentrate on the music . When he does , the show is a pure pleasure to watch and listen to . His pure enjoyment of being a performer is reflected here , at his best when just doing his thing on standards like WHAT NOW MY LOVE and Kern's OLD MAN RIVER , or simply doing slow ballads to a Bossa Nova beat , like QUIET NIGHTS , CHANGE PARTNERS , I CONCENTRATE ON YOU and THE GIRL FROM IPANEMA accompanied by ANTONIO CARLOS JOBIM on the guitar . ELLA FITZGERALD gets a lot of time to do her special brand of singing and is especially good on BODY AND SOUL , DON'T BE THAT WAY and STOMPIN ' AT THE SAVOY . The finale is a rousing duet by Sinatra and Fitzgerald on THE LADY IS A TRAMP backed by the wonderful Nelson Riddle Orchestra . Pure gold for Sinatra fans . Only drawback is the rather awkward staging , which has a partial audience visible throughout on platform seats behind the singers .
Simplified version of events is sincere attempt to tell the story . . .	Missing the mark is this MIRACLE OF OUR LADY OF FATIMA , although a sincere attempt has been made to tell the story without too many additions or over-dramatizing of actual events . Even Max Steiner's busy background score is not enough to overcome the many flaws evident in the telling . The simple truth is that none of it comes to life as vividly as THE SONG OF BERNADETTE managed to do during the previous decade , with its nuanced understanding of the various political events that shaped the period . Here the political elements are seen simply as a repression of all things pertaining to religion and oppression of The Catholic Church by the authorities in Portugal in a sort of paranoia about Communism . To be fair , this tale of children seeing The Virgin Mary and stirring up the wrath of unbelievers is told in a straightforward manner without any name stars or over-dramatizing of the actual events . And the only marquee name is GILBERT ROLAND whose role is that of a fictional rogue who helps the children when they need some aid . But the children are not quite up to the task demanded of them by the screenplay ( nor are they as appealing as they ought to be ) and the script never matches the soaring religiosity of Steiner's musical themes . The climactic spinning of the sun for the miracle sequence is well done even though this was long before CGI effects were available . On the technical side , the Warnercolor badly needs restoration . It has a muddy look that surely is not intentional nor the way it looked when the film was originally released . Overall , a fairly accurate re-telling of events but not as inspirational as it should have been . Hopefully , it will prompt those who don't know the Fatima story to do some research of their own .
Margaret O'Brien tear-jerker is better than most of her early films . . .	JAMES CRAIG and MARSHA HUNT have the adult leads in LOST ANGEL but it's obvious that MGM was hoping the vehicle , specially written for child star MARGARET O'BRIEN , would prove to boost her box-office popularity at a time when she was being groomed for big time stardom . It did . At six , she was quite a little actress , able to turn on the tears on cue and spoke in that quivering little voice that most viewers found enormously appealing . She plays a child prodigy who's been raised by a psychological clinical institute but robbed of a normal childhood . When reporter Craig is sent to do a story on her , he gets stuck with the kid because the clinic is quarantined for measles . The rest of the plot has to deal with Craig's handling of a difficult situation , including the child's jealousy over his relationship with Hunt . Margaret still had all of her childish appeal at this stage and she does well with her character , except for an unnecessary crying scene at a nightclub . Craig and Hunt exhibit some good chemistry in their byplay and are always a pleasure to watch . And , of course , there's a predictable happy ending for all . Trivia note : Sharp-eyed fans will note AVA GARDNER in a bit role as the girl behind the checkroom counter in the nightclub scene and BOBBY BLAKE as a little boy who confronts Margaret . Another future child star , little BOBBY DRISCOLL , makes a brief appearance as the boy on the train playing with his toy train . Summing up : O'Brien fans will like this one .
Bugs is a reluctant astronaut until he sees the carrots . . .	This is a highly amusing Bugs Bunny romp from Chuck Jones . This time the bunny is a reluctant astronaut who wants nothing to do with the spaceship to Mars , only changing his mind at the last minute when he spots the carrots being loaded . Turns out he's not alone when he lands there . Seems that Marvin the Martian has also landed and is intent on blowing up the earth . When Bug realizes the Martian's sinister intentions - - and has some amusing conversations with Marvin and his henchman - - a silly looking dog - - he goes into action to prevent the catastrophe . Crisply drawn , with Bugs Bunny benefiting from Mel Blanc's colorful vocal assistance , it's a very amusing spin on all the Buck Rogers type of stuff audiences were lapping up in the late ' 40s and well into the ' 50s . Timely and terrific .
Fascinating but definitely the sort of musical that is an acquired taste . . .	Tim Burton gives us the dark side of Old London with cinematography that might just as well have used glorious B & W rather than drab color . Perhaps only the blood ( of which there's plenty ) could have been filmed in vivid tones of red and the rest in B & W , since this basically falls into the horror film category - - with music . Some of Stephen Sondheim's lyrics are enormously clever and at the same time simple , except for certain songs sung by HELENA BONHAM CARTER as Mrs . Lovett , the infamous woman with a bakery shop on Fleet Street . She has some of the most difficult material to handle and she does it extremely well . JOHNNY DEPP manages to sing the part of Sweeney Todd without actually being a professional singer - - so he's effective enough but one can sense how much more powerful this would have been with a real singer . Performance wise , he's fine . SACHA BARON CONEN is a surprise as Pirelli , demonstrating a good voice and an Italian manner that makes him sound like Stromboli from Disney's " Pinocchio " . ALAN RICKMAN is as slick as ever as a cruel villain who gets his comeuppance from the devilish pair of Mrs . Lovett and Mr . Todd , as do most of the other members of the large cast . ED SANDERS as Toby has a nice boy soprano voice and does an excellent job of emoting , and JAYNE WISENER has a lyrical voice that suits the song she sings while gazing out the window at the film's start . All of the orchestrations sound strong and full-bodied but I can't say that any of the songs are the kind that stayed with me on a first viewing . Perhaps after a few more looks at the film , some of them will begin to stick . It's definitely worth watching for any fan of musicals , although you have to be prepared to expect all the blood letting - - even if the gushes look a bit fake . Burton loves to depict horror with a wicked gleam in his eyes , or so it seems , and he runs the full gamut of horror right up until the final scene that has a rather shocking conclusion . Haven't seen the play but have heard Angela Lansbury do some of the songs from the Broadway show . The film's biggest drawback is the fact that all of the photography is deliberately dark and moody , with rarely a glimpse of sunshine , and after awhile this becomes a strain on the eyes . We get the dark nature of the story from the beginning , no need to hammer the point home with an Old London atmosphere that is drearier than anything Dickens could have imagined . Summing up : Sondheim's score doesn't rank with his best , nor is this Tim Burton's best film - - but it's well worth a watch thanks to the very energetic work of Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter in difficult , very demanding roles .
Handsome , little heralded historical romance has its virtues . . .	DIANE is probably the least well-known of all LANA TURNER's " big " pictures at MGM - - the studio which ironically was on the verge of bankruptcy at the time of this film , but you'd never know it from the opulence of the finished work in gorgeous Technicolor and featuring one of Miklos Rozsa's more subtle scores . It's interesting for a couple of reasons : mainly , because it appears to be a faithful recreation of that period in costumes and settings , features ROGER MOORE ( youthful and handsome before his James Bond adventures ) , and gives LANA TURNER and MARISA PAVAN some very interesting moments as they oppose each other in a number of well played scenes . Other than that , it's a stilted costume romance that never quite comes to life despite all the efforts to give it handsome production values . That explains its obscurity among Lana's films . The lady herself is very fetching here , beautifully costumed ( mostly in black ) , thanks to Walter Plunkett's designs , and attractively photographed for maximum glamor effect . But part of the unreality comes from the excessive glamor given to Turner . Despite this flaw , she does turn in a good performance as Diane de Poitiers , courtesan who stirs envy in the king's wife and is the subject of much court intrigue in medieval France . Neglected by today's viewers who probably have never had a chance to see it , it deserves a wider audience .
Film's only distinction is the John Dillinger background story . . .	This was the film John Dillinger was watching in Chicago , the last one he saw before being shot to death as he left the theater . That film history fact is about the only real distinction this well named " melodrama " has . Once again , it's a buddy story for Gable , this time the childhood pal of WILLIAM POWELL . Seems he and CLARK GABLE were boyhood buddies when they were kids , with one guy taking the straight and narrow path ( guess which one ? ) and the other becoming a gangster with a heart of gold . Both of them love the same woman ( MYRNA LOY ) . Where have you heard that one before ? Surprisingly , it won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay by Arthur Caesar in ' 35 , at a time when these story elements may have seemed new . The cast surrounding the stars is an excellent one and Woody Van Dyke II directed with his usual skill , but there's no doubt of the film's dated attitudes and style as an old-fashioned melodrama . Trivia note : Hardest to accept is the fact that Mickey Rooney grows up to be Clark Gable ! The mawkish melodrama starts with Mickey and his boyhood chum losing their parents in a shipboard fire and being adopted by a kind old man . The calendar moves on and before we know it the kids are a grown-up CLARK GABLE ( who has become a gambler called " Blackie " ) and the studious friend , WILLIAM POWELL , who has studied to be a lawyer while Gable is at a roulette table most of the time . If the story sounds familiar , you might be thinking of " San Francisco " which had Gable and Tracy taking different paths and in love with the same woman - - this time it's MYRNA LOY . Loy plays her role as though it's an extension of her Nora role in " The Thin Man " , so nothing seems fresh and original about the characters . Gable's not at his best with a short haircut and no sideburns that make his ears so prominent and a pencil thin mustache . Powell is his usual debonair self but the love triangle has a rather predictable outcome with Loy wavering between the two men but preferring Powell's gallant behavior to the brusque Gable . The saving grace of the screenplay is the unpredictable ending which has Powell forced to make a moral choice and reviewing his own sense of ethics . It's a well done examination of self , brought on by his great friendship with Gable and the final scenes are effectively played . Too slow for modern audiences , the film is notable only for the good chemistry between the stars but is overly melodramatic at every turn . NAT PENDLETON and ISABEL JEWELL offer some weak comic relief .
Pleasant entry in the Falcon series . . .	TOM CONWAY seemed to be settling comfortably into his Falcon role ( inherited from brother George Sanders ) by the time he made THE FALCON AND THE CO-EDS . The setting is the quaint Blue Cliff School for Young Ladies and The Falcon is there to solve the murder of a professor . The cast is an attractive one - - and once again the cast includes AMELITA WARD and JEAN BROOKS . RITA CORDAY and ISABEL JEWELL are further additions to the charming female cast and all are among the suspects when the school's headmistress is also murdered . The usual comic relief from bumbling detectives and some silly schoolgirls in love with The Falcon , it's diverting entertainment as well as an intriguing mystery . Worthwhile watch for Falcon fans .
Who're you gonna call when you need ghostbusters ? . . .	Decades ahead of " Ghostbusters " , this Mickey Mouse cartoon was an extra feature on the ICHABOD AND MR . TOAD feature from Disney , about a quartet of ghosts in a spooky old house bored out of their wits with nobody to scare . A newspaper ad advertising the services of ghostbusters Mickey , Donald and Goofy , catches their attention and lo and behold , they've got the trio arriving at the mansion ready to go to work . The fun begins as soon as they enter the house and from then on it's strictly a series of sight gags as the ghost hunters are scared out of their wits at the pranks dreamed up by the lively quartet . Funniest segment has Goofy doing a mirror routine with a ghost likeness who follows his every move and gesture . The payoff is the finale where an accidental mishap scares the ghosts away and turns the whole thing into a mission accomplished for the naive ghostbusters . Nice animation , good background art and some clever plotting make this one a sure fire delight for young and old Disney fans .
Another DePalma thriller that owes a lot to Hitchcock . . .	BLOW OUT deserves more attention than a lot of other thrillers from the ' 80s , partly because it's taut with suspense most of the time and owes a lot of its chill to JOHN LITHGOW's performance as a cold-blooded psychotic killer . It's also one of JOHN TRAVOLTA's best early roles as a soundman looking for " the perfect scream " for one of his horror movies who accidentally shoots some film of a car careening off a bridge . He dives into the water to try saving the victims but is only able to rescue the woman ( NANCY ALLEN ) . It turns out that the driver was a senator who was a presidential candidate ( shades of Chappaquiddick ) . From then on , the mystery deepens as he comes to suspect there's some kind of conspiracy involved . DENNIS FRANZ is Allen's boss , a sleazy photographer , who offers to help Travolta . The whole story is filmed with all the DePalma camera tricks and touches that keep the suspense boiling until the climactic shoot-out at the climax . But it's JOHN LITHGOW who steals the film as the merciless killer with undisclosed political reasons for his murderous mission . A forgotten gem among the stylish DePalma films that deserves more recognition today . I'm not much of a Travolta fan , but this is one of his better roles .
Dietrich looks great throughout Russian revolution . . .	No matter that the world is crumbling around her , MARLENE DIETRICH is always ready for her close-up . She gets plenty of them in KNIGHT WITHOUT ARMOR , a sort of poor man's " Dr . Zhivago " with overtones of " The 39 Steps " and other such thrillers thrown in . ROBERT DONAT is the dashing hero and he looks fine , although it is said that he was already suffering badly from the asthma that would eventually kill him years later . It helps to have some background on this subject before watching because the film gets off to a murky start about opposing forces in Russia and Donat being asked to become a British spy and assuming the identity of a Russian . The first big action scene is just one of many explosions along the way , as Donat decides to help Dietrich escape from the revolutionaries around them who are brutally bent on killing each other . I was too tired to watch the whole movie and will have to wait to see how it all turns out the next time it airs on TCM . Marlene Dietrich's fans will see her looking her glorious best throughout all the strife and turmoil of the Russian Revolution . Interesting to note that this was Miklos Rozsa's first assignment as a composer . He makes use of lively Russian folk tunes throughout .
Simple , warm , cosy and sentimental without being cloying . . .	There's a breath of spring feeling about ENCHANTED APRIL - - nothing deep , just a story of four women who want to escape from it all , share a villa in Italy , and find that the enchanted environment brings about small changes in each one of them in a positive manner . MIRANDA RICHARDSON is the quiet housewife who seems to think her husband is bored with her ; POLLY WALKER is a pretty socialite who wants to be admired for more than her beauty ; JOAN PLOWBRIGHT is a crotchety older woman who learns to appreciate friendship when it's offered ; and JOSIE LAWRENCE is the rather scatterbrained , almost eccentric woman who is unsure about her marriage until she invites her husband ( JIM BROADBENT ) to the charming place in the country where she feels nothing but good vibes . MICHAEL KITCHEN is the owner of the villa who falls for Richardson , thinking she's a widow , but then finds consolation with the pretty socialite who appreciates that he didn't warm up to her on the basis of her looks alone ( he's nearsighted ) . Most humorous aspect of the story is the relationship between Walker and her hubby , ALFRED MOLINA , whose relaxing bath turns into one of the films only " explosive " moments when he fails to understand Italian and the meaning of the word for dangerous . It's a simple tale , woven tightly together by the four strands of storytelling , and passes the time pleasantly enough even though there are times when nothing seems to be happening . The pace is very slow , even for a film with a running time of little more than an hour and thirty minutes , so it's not a tale for every taste . It's a quietly reflective character study of perfect strangers learning about each other . Nicely photographed in Italian locations , it's visually pleasing and easy to take , but really nothing special happens here .
Monogram and Toler join for enjoyable low-budget entry in the series . . .	I'll say one thing for these Charlie Chan films . There's never a shortage of murder suspects and the clues are always readily apparent to the master sleuth but not to the audience . At least , that's the usual pattern , even when Sidney Toler joined forces with Monogram for several B-picture entries in the series . CHARLIE CHAN IN THE SECRET SERVICE follows the pattern precisely , even giving us a final gathering of suspects from which to venture our own guess as to the identity of the murderer . As usual , it's at your own risk for it seldom turns out to be the most obvious . Once again , Toler plays it close to the vest without giving the audience much of a hint as to which suspect he's onto . The story gets off to a fast start with the murder of an inventor of a torpedo plan murdered in his own home being guarded by secret service bodyguards . Chan gets the call to solve the case and discovers that the inventor's plans are missing . " No one leaves until case ends satisfactorily , " he tells the police . Chan is soon joined by two of his eldest children , who are no help at all in solving the crime . Nor is MANTAN MORELAND as Birmingham Brown , wild-eyed with fear as still another murder occurs . The explanations are strictly a wild concoction by the screenwriter who has left no stone unturned to make sure that the old cliché about " the least obvious suspect " is once again a truism . Summing up : Good for a few chuckles , but it doesn't play fair with the clues .
Spielberg talks enthusiastically about his films . . .	I'm not quite sure why the credits state that this was " written by Richard Schickel " because STEVEN SPIELBERG does all of the talking without notes , seemingly from the top of his head , and they seem to be his own words , not the words of a writer . He begins telling how he made home movies as a boy , and as a young man took one of those bus tours to the Universal studio where he hid out in the men's restroom and waited until the tour left before he began his own walking tour of the various buildings . After meeting one of the department heads , he was lucky enough to get a three day pass that enabled him to return day after day for further inspection of the premises and to get familiar with the various aspects of film-making . He even returned on the fourth day , hoping the studio guard would recognize him and let him in . He did , and Spielberg spent the rest of his summer vacation on the Universal studio lot . He dropped out of college in his sophomore year to direct and thereby began his career behind the camera , first in films for television ( his first TV film starred Joan Crawford and Barry Sullivan ) , and then for the major studios . He has some fascinating tidbits to tell about his reasons for making all the films on his resume - - everything from early films like DUEL and SUGARLAND EXPRESS , to his triumph with JAWS and CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND . He even had to learn from his failure with 1941 ( Pauline Kael had warned him what a difficult time critics would give him once he had a failure ) . But then came RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK , E . T . and JURASSIC PARK , all of which benefited from his unbridled imagination and enthusiasm . He discusses his darker films too , declaring that THE COLOR PURPLE was his first adult drama ; that EMPIRE OF THE SUN was told from a boy's point of view , always looking upward at the freedom of flying ; SCHINDLER'S LIST was the portrait of a very ambiguous man and a very difficult period for the Jewish people . He talks too about SAVING PRIVATE RYAN , A . I . , MINORITY REPORT , WAR OF THE WORLDS , MUNICH and AMISTAD , and why these projects captured his imagination and were important projects for him to do . Any film buff would be interested in this documentary on a great filmmaker .
Dangerfield romps through college for his kid's sake . . .	He may be brash , bombastic , crude and uneducated and doesn't get much respect - - but RODNEY DANGERFIELD gets just about all the laughs in this travesty of college life in the ' 80s . He's seen to it that it's full of memorable one-liners that are just as sassy as any he uses in his stand-up nightclub act . And he's surrounded himself with a cast that really gets into the spirit of things . SALLY KELLERMAN is the vivacious English professor that soon becomes the love of his life ; ADRIENNE BARBEAU is his shrewish ex-wife ; KEITH GORDON is the son who is not exactly Big Man on the Campus ; and ROBERT DOWNEY , JR . is the kind of left-wing activist you can find on any college campus , making the most of a role that he could play in his sleep . For subtlety , if there is any , there's a Dean Martin ( NED BEATTY ) who allows the uneducated Dangerfield to enter the halls of ivy merely because he's got a pocket full of cash and wants to splurge it on the school's administration , good philanthropist that he is . It's strictly a funfest for RODNEY DANGERFIELD fans - - of which there are many , judging from the comments here - - but it's an enjoyable romp that has some telling truths to say about a variety of college subjects , all the while injecting its own brand of wild humor on every situation . Clever writing makes it all very enjoyable .
A " great escape " French style . . . intriguing but not completely satisfying . . .	For a film that has been hailed over the years as a masterpiece , GRAND ILLUSION is showing its age . I'm speaking now from a technical standpoint . The version shown on TCM has a series of scenes linked together by choppy editing , abrupt changes of scene that lack smooth narrative style . But overall , the B & W photography is sharp and glistens with the life brought to the story by an excellent cast . It seems a bit more profound in tackling the subject of prisoners of war , but there are many moments when you might think you're watching the French version of " The Great Escape " or " Stalag 17 " . The somber mood that prevails is broken intermittently by scenes of male bonding amid camaraderie and clowning around , especially the scene where the men decide to put on a show for the German officers . Needless to say , the drag show is good for a few laughs before the plot has them all struggling to hatch an escape plan , one that hasn't been used before . But it soon becomes apparent that Capt . Von Rauffenstein ( ERICH VON STROHEIM ) , an aristocratic German in command , has taken an instant dislike to two prisoners especially , a Frenchman ( JEAN GABIN ) and a Jew ( MARCEL DALIO ) , both from the lower class . The class distinction also includes Von Rauffenstein's tolerance for an aristocratic French officer ( PIERRE FRESNAY ) , who later becomes the pivotal character in helping the two most despised prisoners escape . The World War I story is poorly paced for a film that runs almost two hours and , as noted before , the editing leaves a lot to be desired . The story's final section takes place in a farmhouse after the two have escaped , supposedly to show the mutual trust and comradeship that develops between the Jew , the Frenchman and a German farm woman who gives them shelter during the Christmas season . Presumably , the intent is to show that the horrors of war are best forgotten when it's time for humans to treat each other with compassion . Worth watching if you don't mind reading the sub-titles ( which are plentiful throughout ) , except for a short exchange between Erich Von Stoheim and Pierre Fresnay that is spoken in English . Perhaps it was the only part of the negative available when scenes were put together from various pieces for continuity . Not really the masterpiece that others have called it , with pacifist overtones that are non too subtle in those final scenes . It's an interesting glimpse into the past via the French cinema , nothing more , nothing less , but well worth viewing . As an " escape " film , it falls far short of the adventurous spirit we're used to in more recent outings of American cinema , and certainly it lacks the rugged style and pace of " The Great Escape " or " Stalag 17 " .
" Don't meddle with the dark forces	Handsomely photographed , nicely atmospheric thriller gets off to a good start with NICK ADAMS arriving at a creepy mansion . . . a nice Gothic atmosphere with plenty of fog rolling in . A gruff greeting from reclusive BORIS KARLOFF ( who wants Adams to leave immediately ) gives rise to the suspicion that all is not well in the handsome mansion - - that someone is hiding a dreadful secret . It seems that Karloff has discovered a glowing meteor which gives him strange powers . The invalid mother of the woman Adams has come to see warns him to get away from the house as soon as he can . " You must think this house is obsessed with mystery , " she tells him . And for awhile , she's right . So is the viewer , even though she tries to unravel some of the mystery to Adams before mutation overcomes her . It's a strange mixture of science fiction and horror - - of Adams ' strictly American accent and the British accents of the rest of the cast . Karloff may be in a wheelchair , but he's still capable of giving a very strong performance as keeper of the secrets who is not careful enough in evoking the dark powers . Something seems to be smothering everyone in the mansion - - so much so that the message seems to be " Don't meddle with the dark forces . . . He who tampers there will be destroyed . " Intriguing tale is slow to unravel , but nicely handled and given first class treatment of handsome interiors . There's a definite Roger Corman influence in all the horror and mutation aspects . In the end , the greenhouse holds the key to the mystery with a heavy dose of science fiction regarding radiation and the green glow . Summing up : An interesting Gothic treat for fans of horror and / or science fiction , given good production values but a story that's often a strain on credibility .
Philo Vance solves a rather exotic mystery . . .	Not bad at all . This is an interesting tale , although the characters are strictly stereotypes and all of them used as red herrings to leave the solution nowhere in sight until you start thinking about how the story started . Then - - a glimmer of light - - and you've guessed it . WARREN WILLIAM makes an affable , bright , know-it-all Philo Vance , who seems to have a background in everything , including exotic fish from the orient . But how he reaches his scientific answer to the crime is a bit implausible - - as is the whole plot involving the legend of a deadly dragon living in the dragon pool . MARGARET LINDSAY looks lovelier than ever in the film's leading femme role , LYLE TALBOT is well cast as her love interest , and EUGENE Palette gets to do some comedy relief that's a welcome contrast to Vance's superior attitude . GEORGE E . STONE does his usual schtick as one of the wealthy guests at the mansion where all the action takes place and ROBERT BARRAT is interesting as one of the suspects . Summing up : Pleasant programmer passes the time in an entertaining way . Trivia note : The IMDb processor refuses to let me spell Eugene Palette's name correctly . There should be two " ll " s in his last name .
All the ingredients for a good mystery during the first hour . . .	This is a review of the first installment in a two-part version of THE SITTAFORD MYSTERY on TV . Once again , although there is no Miss Marple in the original story , the writers have planted her in the midst of all the characters staying at an old inn . That's not the objection most of the comments here have to make . What IS resented is the fact that story elements have been drastically changed by the writers of the teleplay , even changing the identify of the murderer in the original story . This is the kind of thing bound to upset purists who want their Agatha Christie stories told without all the unnecessary changes . What upsets me is that , first of all , GERALDINE McEWAN does not make a plausible Miss Marple . She's much too mild-mannered and lacks the intelligent inquisitiveness that Joan Hickson displayed so well in her interpretation of the role on the former British series . But secondly , not having read the original recently , I was totally unaware of all the changes when viewing the first hour and I found it an engrossing kind of story , if a bit confusing in the way the narrative unfolded , especially with regard to the opening scenes at the Egyptian tomb . But TIMOTHY DALTON gave a compelling performance , using his personality to put some life into the role of Captain Trevelyan ( whom I later found out dies in the first chapter of the Christie story ) . It took a whole hour for his death to take place here . But that was a minor change , according to all these other comments , and at this point I have no idea what awaits in the second installment . I can only say that despite all these " flaws " in the presentation , I thoroughly enjoyed the story with its ingredients of a fierce blizzard , an old country inn , a seance where a death is predicted , an assortment of strange guests , and a bevy of competent British players , some of whom ( Rita Tushingham in particular ) I never would have recognized without reading the cast list . It was nice to recognize JAMES WILBY as Mr . Kirkwood , proprietor of the hotel . So , while I confess I did enjoy the first segment , I can understand why many were disappointed in the drastic changes to the story . The writers did the same thing with several other Christie " adaptations , " including one of my favorites , EASY TO KILL ( even the title was changed to " Murder Is Easy " and it ruined a perfectly good Christie story by changing the emphasis to the romantic leads and practically leaving the murderer out of the story ) . Personally , I enjoy all of these Christie stories but do not think Miss Marple or Poirot should be injected for the sake of whatever following these kind of things have on TV .
Enchanting Depression-era comedy . . .	True , TATUM O'NEIL won an Oscar for her role as Addie Pray in PAPER MOON and fully deserved it . Her dad , RYAN O'NEIL must have been proud of her but his only reward was a Golden Globe nomination . The con artist and little girl theme had been used before in Damon Runyon's famous comedy " Little Miss Marker " with Shirley Temple and Adolphe Menjou . But here the twist is that the girl is just as much a con artist as the man - - and that's the key that makes the film so much more palatable for 1970s audiences without getting too sentimental about it . There's a real Depression-era feeling to the whole story , with some richly detailed panoramas of rural America and its citizens at that time in history . Peter Bogdanovich has done a commendable job in making sure that his authentic backgrounds illuminate an enchanting tale about two drifters who share an unusual partnership when it becomes clear to the man that the girl would be a valuable aid in his con work . There's a bright supporting role by MADELINE KAHN as Trixie Delight , a stripper who tosses off some good one-liners , but it's the chemistry between Tatum and Ryan that turns this into the most satisfying " buddy " movie of the ' 70s . Summing up : A treat not to be missed .
James Whales ' creation is still a spine-tingler . . .	The moment COLIN CLIVE speaks that immortal line : " It's alive ! It's alive ! " you get the kind of chill that makes watching FRANKENSTEIN such fun . Atmospherically , it ranks with the best of the old B & W Universal horror films , although today , watching it produces rather distracting visions of what Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks did with YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN , adhering to all the traditions of this early version of the tale . And , of course , with a lot of humor that is missing in this grim take on the story . It's Clive and DWIGHT FRYE as his helper , Fritz , that really give two of the film's most memorable performances . The secondary roles played by JOHN BOLES and MAE CLARKE make no particular impression and are merely standard stock parts . EDWARD VAN SLOAN as Dr . Waldman is effective in a lesser role . And , of course , BORIS KARLOFF is truly magnificent as the creature who , indeed , looks as though he's made from dead body parts . Even the haunted expression on his face is enough to chill . He uses his whole body to express anguish and emotion - - including his arms , his hands , and his walk . All of his mad rages are extremely well handled by the consummate actor . Karloff manages to bring sympathy and pity for the creature , despite his many manic moments . The suspense builds when he escapes from his confines and all of these climactic scenes still have the power to enthrall , as he strolls through the countryside and terrifies the villagers . The scene by the water with the little girl who befriends him is particularly touching . Summing up : Still chilling after all these years thanks to masterful direction by James Whale , great sets and fine cinematography . Well worth treasuring for preserving BORIS KARLOFF's memorable role .
Quality sequel is visually even more stunning than " Frankenstein " . . .	Even better than the original . Add to the quality of FRANKENSTEIN some even better visuals ( German expressionism again in the sets ) , the grander look and concept of the whole story with the monster humanized in a believable way , and the music of Franz Waxman which highlights all of the most dramatic moments , especially the creation of The Bride - - and you have a film even more satisfying than the original . COLIN CLIVE is implored by ERNEST THESIGER to help him make a mate for the monster . Eventually , a memorable scene with the Bride being unveiled ( it turns out to be ELSA LANCHESTER who can scream with the best of them ) , has her seeing her mate for the first time and gazing at him with wide-eyed fright as she lets out a piercing scream . It's just one of many comical and whimsical moments in the whole film . VALERIE HOBSON is Clive's frightened sweetheart , and UNA O'CONNOR ( another screamer ) , DWIGHT FRYE and JOHN CARRADINE round out the supporting cast with style . BORIS KARLOFF repeats his famous role , even more engaging this time as he seems significantly brighter in the range of things he's given to do , such as the famous woodland scene interacting with a blind man in a cottage , both of them enjoying a new friendship . This scene , especially , will remind you of Mel Brooks ' YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN , but it's played here more as a tender interlude rather than comedy . Totally absorbing with great looking sets and atmosphere , heightened by a Franz Waxman score worth listening to . Fans of the original should love this one .
Interesting , if improbable , tale in typical Chaney mode . . .	LON CHANEY delivers an interesting performance ( especially when posing as a kindly old woman ) , but not even the great Chaney can overcome all the defects in this remake of the 1925 silent . For starters , the performances around him include two extremely bad examples of early screen acting - - from awkward Lila Lee and a young man who would later turn his talent to directing rather than acting - - Elliot Nugent . Nugent has the hapless role of an innocent , naive young man and plays it in hopelessly nerd style - - a foretaste , perhaps , of his Broadway role as the timid professor in THE MALE ANIMAL . Anyway , his is the weakest performance in the film with Lila not far behind . The tale itself is interesting enough to hold the attention - - and especially chilling is the malice ( pure evil ) displayed by Harry Earle as the malevolent midget . Unfortunately , most of his dialogue is unintelligible due to his German accent , something director Jack Conway should have noted . Only real satisfaction is watching Lon Chaney in one of his last roles . He is excellent and makes it painful to realize he was fighting throat cancer while filming was underway . A better script , production values , and tighter direction by Conway would have worked wonders to make this tale more chilling and believable . Summing up : At best , it is an interesting example of Chaney's considerable talent despite the primitive acting technique displayed by Lila Lee and Elliot Nugent . Nugent's performance makes one grateful he switched to directing later in his career , with more satisfying results .
Kirk Douglas in another strong performance . . .	KIRK DOUGLAS deserved at least an Oscar nomination for his role as the high-strung detective who sees things in terms of black and white - - no grays in between - - while co-star ELEANOR PARKER did receive a Best Actress nomination for her role as his wife with a secret in her past . William Wyler has taken the stage play and turned it into a gripping story about events unfolding in a New York Police Precinct dealing with all the everyday petty thieves and criminals who keep the police busy trying to sort out their stories . On the debit side , by today's standards , all of the most intense performances seem more than a little melodramatic . And that includes Douglas and Parker . Yet , the film remains fascinating . Kirk's character , a man of rigid principles with a strict moral code , is unable to forgive his wife for her past indiscretions , and his wife realizes that she can't live with a man who's unable to let go of his accusing nature . LEE GRANT does a brilliant job as a nerdy shoplifter , although her New York accent seems a bit forced at times . All the precinct characters , including WILLIAM BENDIX and FRANK FAYLEN , are marvelously well cast , as is CATHY O'DONNELL as the sweet young thing who wants to do the right thing for a good guy nabbed for embezzling . It all works beautifully , as directed by William Wyler , with the melodrama reaching a fever pitch once certain disclosures are made involving Kirk's marital problems . Summing up : Outstanding performances and riveting story make this a must see .
One of the more successful attempts to film a Hemingway story . . .	THE MACOMBER AFFAIR has to be rated a success for the mere fact that it finally brings a Hemingway story to the screen pretty much intact and the way he wrote it . GREGORY PECK may not be the perfect choice to play the guide escorting a quarrelsome JOAN BENNETT and ROBERT PRESTON on a safari , but he acquits himself well enough in the role . I found it a lot more satisfying than the later SNOWS OF KILIMINJARO in which Peck again was cast in the lead as a Hemingway white hunter in Africa . Although that film had the advantage of Technicolor and more expensive trappings , THE MACOMBER AFFAIR achieves more of an edge by being photographed in somber B & W , even though some of the stock footage and backgrounds are obviously studio shots . Bennett is fascinating as the woman full of scorn for her husband and gradually showing her interest in Peck while Preston's resentment begins to turn paranoid . Miklos Rozsa's score gives it a film noir feeling despite the jungle setting - - and it becomes a war of nerves before the satisfying conclusion . Well worth watching for some interesting performances .
Stirring , well-acted , realistic tribute to the U . S . Merchant Marines . . .	Despite plenty of wartime propaganda and the usual amount of clichés and other staples of WWII action melodramas , ACTION IN THE NORTH Atlantic is given a boost by some of the best staged action scenes ever featured in a Warner Bros . movie of that era . The realism is startling considering that special effects then included no computer engineering . The script is basically the story of U . S . Merchant Marine survivors of a battle determined to sink the ship that ruthlessly cut into their lifeboat . The climax has them getting their revenge on the Germans after a fierce battle that concludes with the Americans and their farewell ceremonies to shipmates killed during battle . Bogart is given some flag-waving lines to read and the film concludes with a commentary using FDR's voice to salute the Merchant Marines and their contribution to the war effort . Lloyd Bacon directs with a firm , vigorous treatment of all the battle scenes and only occasionally does the film slow down when dealing with the domestic front . Julie Bishop does a nice job as Bogart's girlfriend and later wife , while Raymond Massey shares his domestic homecoming with Ruth Gordon as his wife . But the film's merits are chiefly due to the action sequences , which are by far among the best ever featured in a Bogart film . Action is what you get here . . . but don't expect anything deep . Bogart fans won't be disappointed . Dane Clark plays his usual hothead role with gusto and Alan Hale is a welcome addition to the supporting cast .
John Gilbert in an offbeat and interesting Tod Browning film . . .	JOHN GILBERT was toward the end of his career as a romantic leading man at the age of 27 in THE SHOW , co-starring once again with his leading lady from THE BIG PARADE , RENEE ADOREE . POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEADThe story has moments of interest when it deals with Gilbert's role as a circus barker for side shows that attract curious crowds with their freakish overtones . He himself is involved in an act that involves the deft use of trickery when Salome ( danced by Adoree ) requests his head on a silver platter . The act requires a fake sword to be substituted for the real thing and a trap door that lets him escape the executioner's ax . Meanwhile , Gilbert has arranged to take care of the money entrusted to him by a love-struck girl whose father has been murdered by scheming LIONEL BARRYMORE . For bad guy Gilbert , guarding the money is like taking candy from a baby and doesn't fool his sweetheart , RENEE ADOREE who questions his motives . LIONEL BARRYMORE is the stage colleague intent on stealing the money for his own selfish goals . His scheme eventually backfires and , for the love of an honest woman , Gilbert returns the stolen money to the police in time for a happy ending . It's all done in the usual melodramatic style associated with silent films of this period , but the story maintains interest throughout and builds to a satisfying conclusion with Gilbert and Adoree in a final clinch . Summing up : Not quite as bold and startling in nature as some of Browning's other works , but very watchable . Gilbert is intense as the morally bankrupt anti-hero who is reformed by the love of a good woman . It's not his usual romantic role and he was reportedly not too happy with the assignment . At this point in his career , he and MGM head Louis B . Mayer were not on good terms personally . Trivia note : Interesting to see an ambulatory Barrymore before arthritis crippled him . The story is not quite strong enough if it's shock appeal you're looking for .
Dustin Hoffman in seriocomic western on events surrounding Custer . . .	Highly entertaining saga has Dustin Hoffman as the lone elderly survivor of the attack at Little Big Horn , recounting his life history to a skeptical historian - - and it's quite a story , beginning with the massacre of his family in an Indian attack as a ten year-old boy and his growing up among the Cheyennes who adopt him and call him " Little Big Man " when he proves he's a worthy " human being " among them . The handsomely produced tale , filmed in gorgeous color on what appear to be actual locales , follows him throughout episodes always spiced by wicked humor . Especially funny is the sequence where he's delivered to the doorstep of a minister and his wife ( FAYE DUNAWAY ) , a woman who quotes the Bible but has more earthy matters on her mind when she sets eyes on Dustin and assumes the duty of bathing him while promising to avert her eyes at the proper moment . The humor is beneath even the most serious scenes , so that we know the tall tale is being offered as a tongue-in-cheek treatment of Indian / white relationships , as well as a re-evaluation by Hoffman of what General George Armstrong Custer was really like . Custer is shown as a vainglorious type of man who dislikes having his decisions reversed , as what happens when he decides to spare the life of Hoffman at their first meeting - - and later , lives to regret it . Although the running time is well over two hours , the story never lacks interest , with nice use being made of the " Garry Owen " tune that Custer loved . It's used most effectively in the final battle sequence at Little Big Horn which is really something to see . No expense has been spared to give the film realistic looking settings and a fine cast of players . JEFF COREY is amusing as Wild Bill Hickcock , looking very much like Victor Jory behind his beard and mustache and RICHARD MULLIGAN makes a believable Custer . CHIEF DAN GEORGE is excellent as a wise old Indian who turns out to be something of a prophet with his eerie dreams , and KELLY JEAN PETERS is a spirited Olga , Dustin's first wife . Summing up : Highly entertaining treatment and a different , less Hollywood view of the American Indian with a brilliant performance by Dustin Hoffman - - and the age make-up is terrific .
Excellent featurette documentary on the ' Phantom of the Opera ' ( ' 43 ) DVD . . .	This is an impressive , detailed behind-the-scenes story on the various screen versions of PHANTOM OF THE OPERA , described by narrator Scott MacQueen as " a darkly romantic icon of the gaslight era . " The documentary is a look at the earlier versions of the Gaston Leroux story written in 1910 and made even more famous by the 1925 version starring Lon Chaney and Mary Philbin . MacQueen's commentary guides the viewer through the other projects - - the 1930 sound version with which Universal hoped to make another big profit after the success of the silent film . Bits of the sound version can be heard here for the first time . SUSANNA FOSTER and TURHAN BEY both talk about their roles in the 1943 film in which they appeared with NELSON EDDY and CLAUDE RAINS . Jessica Rains , the actor's daughter , recounts some amusing bits of trivia about her father . Film historian RUDY BEHLMER adds some other interesting tidbits about the making of the various versions . Although other actors were considered first for the role of The Phantom , CLAUDE RAINS was between contracts at Warner Bros . and was thus available to take the role , only insisting that the make-up for the disfigured genius not be too severe . Interesting to note that the 1925 set was refurbished for the 1943 version and used regularly since then , a set that Universal has recycled many times over the years and is still standing . Well researched and very interesting , it's a valuable addition to the DVD of 1943's PHANTOM OF THE OPERA , covering a wealth of material and a short history of the Universal studio as the maker of horror films featuring stars like Bela Lugosi , Lon Chaney , Jr . , Basil Rathbone and others .
Eccentric comedy still has fresh appeal . . .	For sheer audacity , you have to congratulate the makers of HAROLD AND MAUDE for taking such a chance on this black comedy material and making it work , largely due to the title roles played so perfectly by RUTH GORDON and BUD CORT . The highly improbable story is entertaining enough to let anyone dismiss the flaws of logic - - a suspension of disbelief that must be had in order to enjoy the wacky tale of how two people from opposite viewpoints ( not to mention different ends of the generation gap ) , meet and fall in love . Funniest sequences are Cort's various attempts at suicide in front of his pragmatic mother , who then decides she must match him with a suitable girl so he can get married . She fills out a questionnaire for him , reciting all the questions posed by the survey and then answering them as she herself believes , rather than waiting for Harold's answer . VIVIAN PICKLE does a rib-tickling job as the mother . RUTH GORDON and BUD CORT play their roles straight , he with an expression of angelic innocence and a rather blank stare , and she with her customary skill at portraying zaniness with an air of eccentricity that is engaging . It all moves very swiftly and tells its tale in an hour-and-a-half , well within the limits of its slight story . The Cat Stevens songs on the soundtrack add a piquancy to the tale , but the ending is just a tad bit disappointing . On a cheery note , we note that Harold has now taken up a musical instrument and intends to live a little as he walks jauntily away from the camera on a hilltop . Summing up : You won't know whether to laugh or cry in some places , but it's a rather sweet little story beautifully executed .
Edward G . Robinson in another powerhouse performance . . .	ALL MY SONS may have been slightly diluted for the screen as compared to the stage play which implicated corruption and wartime profiteering on a higher level than just one or two business men , but it's still powerful stuff and extremely well directed by Irving Reis . Individual scenes have a strength that is impressive , largely due to the excellent central performances of BURT LANCASTER , EDWARD G . ROBINSON and MADY CHRISTIANS . Robinson , in particular , makes the most of a meaty role that has him cocky and confident one moment , then bruised and bitter the next as his past crimes catch up with him - - and his conscience . Seems that during WWII , he and his partner ( FRANK CONROY ) were pressured to finish making cylinder parts for airplanes on the government's tight schedule and knowingly sent defective parts which caused the death of twenty-one pilots when their planes went down . Robinson has been hiding the truth from himself and his neighbors ever since , concerned only with making a decent living for himself and his family in suburban America . Conflicts arise when others around him begin to question his role in the crime that sent his partner to jail . The son of the jailed partner , played in rather stiff fashion by HOWARD DUFF , is unforgiving when he realizes Robinson shared the guilt with his father and yet let his father take the blame for the incident . Lancaster , too , and his girlfriend ( LOUISA HORTON ) who happens to be Duff's sister , also bring the conflicts into the open when they start asking for answers and probing for the truth . Horton is rather colorless in what is meant to be a sympathetic role and spent her remaining years in TV roles . But it's EDWARD G . ROBINSON who makes the biggest impression as the father , proud of his achievements and obviously in denial until his son , Lancaster , makes him realize why his other son never returned from the war - - which leads to a tragic ending . Summing up : Somber drama never quite overcomes its stage origins but it's still powerful stuff . Trivia note : The only implausible factor in the casting - - the physical impossibility of BURT LANCASTER as Robinson's son , when he bears no physical resemblance whatsoever to Eddie - - nor Mady Christians for that matter !
Dave O'Brien - - my favorite " fall guy " . . .	This is one of the best of the Pete Smith specialties starring former stuntman DAVE O'BRIEN as " Mr . Everyman . " In this one , he first copes with parking a car and manages to smash cars in the fore and aft position . Next , he decides to build a patio in his backyard . All he has to do is lay the cement . Not so simple - - especially when a kid's ball lands in the newly laid cement or when a neighbor tries to help and makes more of a mess . So , it's up to Dave to solve the situation . Naturally , he's the worst participant in the solution . By the film's end , he's landed flat on his back in his own cement job . Good for laughs - - and O'Brien's physical prowess is as good as his skill with getting laughs out of slapstick comedy .
Handsome , tastefully produced romance with a warm glow . . .	The 1940s seemed to be the decade of the romantic " women's films " featuring stars like Bette Davis , Merle Oberon , Olivia de Havilland and others . And Samuel Goldwyn had the good taste to hire the best script writers , the best cinematographers , the best musicians , and the best available actors to play in all of his films . None was more romantic than ENCHANTMENT and it has a warm glow about it , despite being a tale of unrequited love whereby an elderly man ( DAVID NIVEN in convincing age make-up ) recalls his younger days and his sweetheart ( TERESA WRIGHT ) who leaves him because of a misunderstanding caused by his neurotic sister ( JAYNE MEADOWS ) . When a young woman ambulance driver ( EVELYN KEYES ) , who happens to be his niece , comes to stay in the grand old house during the London blitz of World War II , he advises her not to make the same mistake he did in following his true love . Result : a happy ending for Keyes and her pilot lover FARLEY GRANGER when she goes rushing after him during an air raid . The tale is told in a clever use of flashbacks from one generation to the other , and all of it is photographed in crisp B & W splendor by Gregg Toland with a quietly effective musical score by Hugo Friedhofer . It's a handsomely mounted production , tastefully done without overdoing the sentimentality of the tale . LEO G . CARROLL is excellent as Niven's servant , realistically aged for the part of the tale that takes place in the present . Highly recommended as a quality picture of its kind . It's also a sad reminder of the fact that after leaving Samuel Goldwyn under the contract system , TERESA WRIGHT's screen career floundered and she soon found that she had to work for lesser salaries in films not worthy of her presence . She became a free agent but admitted that it turned out to be a huge mistake .
Two out of three , not bad . . . for ENCORE . . .	Another Somerset Maugham short story anthology , getting off to a bad start with the first story THE ANT AND THE GRASSHOPPER not exactly first rate but amusing , due to the performances of n'er-do-well NIGEL PATRICK as the philandering brother who ends up marrying the third richest girl in the world much to the annoyance of his stuffy but reliable brother ROLAND CULVER ; a cruise ship story about a woman who never stops talking and driving everyone in sight ( including the audience ) a bit crazy , well played by KAY WALSH ; and finally , a story about a young couple who are part of a diving act from an 80 ft . platform but facing fears about the life and death feat designed to entertain some jaded tourist trade at a fancy hotel . The third and longest segment is the most interesting , with GLYNIS JOHNS as the diver losing her nerve and TERENCE MORGAN as her worried husband . There's no telling which way the ending will go until the last moment and it keeps you glued to the story's finish . Summing up : With introductions by the famous author himself , it's a fun way to spend an hour and a half .
Sprawling epic needed a tighter focus but still has some great moments . . .	Baz Luhrmann has done with Australia what David O . Selznick managed to do with DUEL IN THE SUN - - he's created a sprawling epic of a canvas for a narrow storyline about a woman who needs a man to keep the villains from double-crossing her in a land deal . It's the kind of story every B-western had in the old days , usually with someone like Roy Rogers or Gene Autry playing the cowboy who helps a girl keep her ranch from the outlaws who want it . Here the tale has been expanded to include racial overtones ( which DUEL also had ) and some good cattle drive scenes that teeter into cliff hanging territory . Of course , he's added bits of Australian history to the background of the story - - such as the treatment of Aborigines whom the villain of the piece calls " creamies " and a World War II sequence of Japanese bombing an island off Australia and heading for Darwin . No expense has been spared to make these scenes look very realistic . For production values alone , it deserves a 7 . A sensitive looking boy named BRANDON WALTERS is effective as the boy Nullah whom Kidman comes to love as her own son . Unfortunately , the scenes between Kidman and Walters are clumsily handled by the actress who seems to be forcing herself on the characterization of a woman uncertain of herself when relating to children . Her " Over the Rainbow " moment seems unauthentic . HUGH JACKMAN is great as the cowboy called Drover who is assigned to escort the British born Lady Ashley ( NICOLE KIDMAN ) on a cattle drive where she intends to get a handsome sum for her cattle . David WENHAM makes an excellent villain as the man who opposes Kidman and Jackman all through the story , getting his comeuppance as all good villains eventually do . The sheer predictability of the tale is what hurts it most . We all know that Jackman and Kidman will be locking lips long before the fadeout and that Wenham will make a nasty exit . What we can't foresee is that the story will drift in all sorts of directions about racial inequalities and weird rituals with a bit of World War II bombings thrown in . The casting of the leads hurts the story . Jackman is fine and has obviously buffed up for the role but Kidman is the wrong actress for the part , unable to summon the sort of temperamental display that someone like Kate Winslet was able to do with the role of Rose in TITANIC . A stronger actress would have been a better choice . However , having said all this , there are plenty of gripping moments in Australia that make you wonder why the film isn't doing as well as it should at the box-office . For all of its faults , it's still more engrossing than many films that bring in larger crowds .
In the groove . . .	As an example of the jitterbug craze that swept America during the early ' 40s , GROOVIE MOVIE is about as good a movie short as possible . The various dances are filmed from odd angles ( including beneath a glass floor to show all the intricate steps and patterns ) . The dancers are nimble youngsters who obviously know how to strut their energetic stuff before the cameras , mugging for the close-ups and having a high time while swinging their partners not only to and fro but up and over . A great example of the sort of movie short that played with a feature film in the old days . I'm surprised to read that one of the comments here states : " Not really a movie . It may have been produced to appear in a ' soundie ' but I'm not sure about that . " Obviously , this person never heard of a movie short , the sort that were a featured part of every double feature program in the ' 30s and ' 40s .
Early Bogdanovich thriller really hits the mark . . .	Tight , suspenseful , full of cross-cutting scenes to follow the unfolding of two stories that are about to merge into one , TARGETS is the last major feature film that BORIS KARLOFF made , and it's one of his best during the latter part of his career . He's a man about to retire from the picture business , a horror film star called Byron Orlock , feeling he's too much of an anachronism in the changing world of the late ' 60s and that his kind of horror is passé . The part , in other words , is tailor-made to fit Karloff's real-life persona . The other strand of the story has to do with a deeply disturbed young man ( TIM O'KELLY ) who appears normal on the surface but is harboring ideas of using his arsenal of guns to become a killer . After slaughtering his family , he climbs a tower near a crowded highway and proceeds to target various cars at random , going for the kill with a sharpshooter's precision . He then turns his attention to a drive-in theater , where Byron Orlock is about to make a personal appearance along with his latest film . It's here that the two stories blend into one , as Orlock arrives to make his personal appearance and must confront the killer . It's here that the ending is a little hard to buy , as the script has Orlock becoming heroic enough to stand up to a mad killer . Tense , disturbing , extremely well edited so that the stories blend together smoothly , the only other members of the cast that I recognized were JAMES BROWN , who plays the boy's father - - a hunter who likes to take his son on father / son hunting trips - - and PETER BOGDANOVICH , who plays the director trying to get Orlock to read his script . Let's just say , he's better off behind the camera . A minor gem , it's well worth watching and Karloff's fans get to see him in some vintage footage from his old films .
Early British noir is a visual masterpiece . . . James Mason at his best . . .	ODD MAN OUT is the kind of film that stays within your film memory long after you've seen it - - as in my case , writing this from a memory seared by the experience of watching JAMES MASON in one of his greatest roles as Johnny McQueen , on the lam from the law after a botched robbery ends in the death of a man and he becomes a hunted animal . Visually , the film is the dark and shadowy kind of film noir that has him stumbling into the cold and snowy landscape , wounded and intent on protecting himself from the elements and the mob of people who want to see him dead . Mason's predicament is much like Victor McLaglen's in THE INFORMER , where he finds himself an outsider with little chance of survival in a world where danger lurks everywhere for anyone caught in a web of intrigue and espionage . While the IRA is never mentioned , we understand that this is the criminal organization Johnny led and his fate is more or less sealed once he is on the lam . Brilliant direction by Carol Reed , an anguished performance by the wounded fugitive , JAMES MASON , and wonderful support from Kathleen Ryan and Robert Newton , makes this a superior character study of the good and evil in mankind . Well worth seeing and probably one of Mason's most memorable roles .
Magical moments . . . beautifully photographed . . . excellent score . . .	THE BLACK STALLION is a champion among horse movies . I'm not exactly fond of the genre ( although as a kid I did enjoy the MY FRIEND FLICKA , THUNDERHEAD , SON OF FLICKA and NATIONAL VELVET movies ) , but this film is unsurpassingly beautiful in the way it documents the budding friendship between a boy and a wild Arabian desert horse . After a shipwreck , the boy ( KELLY RENO ) finds himself on a small island with nothing but sand and sun and his only companion - - a horse that keeps its distance from him until the boy wins it over with some very tentative attempts to offer it something to eat . These scenes , comprising 28 minutes of the film , are among the most magical , most beautifully shot and composed scenes ever recorded for an animal story that has an almost fairy-tale quality in mood . The lyrical scenes are underscored by some wonderful background music as the boy eventually is able to ride bareback along the surf , chasing the wind as he clings to the horse that occasionally throws him off . It's that first section of the film that really grabs the viewer's interest and won't let go . The second half is a little more plodding in style but still interesting - - as TERI GARR , the boy's mother , becomes sensitive to her son's connection to the wild animal - - and MICKEY ROONEY shows up as a man who knows all about race horses and is eventually persuaded to train " The Black " to become the mystery horse who enters a big race and emerges the winner . Summing up : A lyrical , one of a kind film for animal lovers and anyone interested in enjoying the craftsmanship that went into the making of a great film . Exquisite film is noteworthy for Mickey Rooney's Oscar-nominated supporting role .
Classic World War II spy drama well worth watching . . .	When I hear the title THE COUNTERFEIT TRAITOR , I immediately think of my father because he often said it was his favorite spy film . Seeing it , years later , I understand why . WILLIAM HOLDEN was in the middle of a winning streak of films at this time and establishing a secure foothold on his reputation as one of Hollywood's finest actors . Since his role requires him to start as a cynical character , before he becomes convinced of the justness of his cause , it's a role that might well have gone to someone like HUMPHREY BOGART . But Holden , fortunately , got the part of the Swedish oil merchant who , through extortion and blackmail , is chosen by HUGH GRIFFITH to act as a spy against the Nazis in Denmark . He does so , unwillingly at first , but gradually , through his meeting with another spy , LILI PALMER ( in one of her best roles ) , comes to see things the way she does . The moment Palmer comes into the film , the plot thickens and interest mounts . The final result is a spy film that is truly mesmerizing , able to get a powerful grip on your heart and emotions , full of colorful action and intrigue . Stunning location photography in and around Copenhagen is a plus factor , as is the rousing score by Alfred Newman . Holden has never been more persuasive in a role that fits him like a glove . Taken from a true-life story , espionage tales don't come any better than this .
