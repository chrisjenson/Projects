Whoa !	Maybe a bit naive to think but I thought that amateur movies like this weren't made anymore in this era - and most certainly didn't received a global release . The movie really surprised me how incredible amateur looking this movie was . Not only with its acting and visual style but also with its technical aspect , such as the editing , camera-positioning . Especially the editing is extremely lacking at times . It makes some sequences come across as disjointed and confusing . Also the weak camera-positioning most certainly doesn't help all of the sequences . At times the movie really looks and feels as if it was being made by a couple of high school students who decided to pick up a camera and start shooting an horror movie . The movie just isn't ever tense , scary or mysterious , were also lies a big problem of the movie obviously . For a genre movie it just does basically everything wrong to reach a good enough and effective end result . The musical score is also quite horrendous . It's a very simple typical kind of movie score , that is too prominently present at times when nothing is happening in the movie and not present at all - or not good enough at the tense or scary moments of the movie . The music has some huge misses in the movie , it could had truly enhanced some of the scare moments and tension of the movie at times . Of course the story also doesn't help much . The movie doesn't have the most incredible pace and story-flow . The movie also tries to be more clever than it really is , by putting in many plot twists and making things seem different than they truly are . Without doubt they also did this to make the movie original . The result however isn't much good , since it makes the movie unnecessarily difficult to follow , especially toward the end , when twists and false twists follow each other rapidly . Through the many twists the movie also starts to make less and less sense . The movie is filled with some gaping holes and the more you actually start thinking about the story , the less sense it starts to make . Not only are there many improbabilities but also many things that just plain good old fashioned plot holes , mistakes and other things that don't make much sense . Judging by looking at this movie Mr . Woelfel ( is that even a real name ? ) watched a bit too many Japanese horror and John Carpenter movies . In its style it mostly tries to impersonate Japanses movies and in its story , storytelling and characters it mostly tries to impersonate John Carpenter horror movies . Nothing wrong with impersonate different styles and applying them to your own style film-making but the style just doesn't work out , mainly due to its poor budget , weak editing and story-flow . It's perhaps even a bit sad to see at times how hard they tried , without a good result . I had no idea who Jay Woelfel was before this but looking at his filmography he seems like a regular B-horror movie maker , who just isn't the most talented or visionary person around , no matter how hard he ever tries . He is one of those typical persons who thinks he can write , direct , produce , edit and compose all of his own movies . And does he think he is Brian De Palma , with using all those redundant and completely pointless split-screen shots that don't add anything at all ? Yep , I think I'm going to watch more Woelfel movies alright . Yes , it's true that the movie is so bad at times that it becomes good . It's unintentionally funny at times , due to how clumsy it is made and how bad the acting and dialog are . Who ever told those persons in this movie that they could act in movies ? Granted that the script with its many weak and often pointless dialog also doesn't help them much but honestly , it's obvious as well that the actors just don't have the talent for the job . On a positive note , the make-up effects are quite good looking . Same goes for the simplistic but effective special-effects . With the same story material but more money and real professionals involved this movie possibly could had been a perfectly good genre movie to watch . But not now .
Woohoo ! Hippies meet Dracula , the Frankenstein monster and Lon Chaney Jr . with an axe !	This movie really reminded me of an Z-movie from the ' 50's . Only difference is that this movie doesn't even have a camp value . In other words , this movie is just plain bad ! It's extremely odd to see how this movie tries to mix the ' 70's hippie culture with classic horror movie characters . I still don't understand why Dracula and the Frankenstein monster were even in this movie . On top of that , the two of them never looked worse in a movie . Their characters add nothing to the story and it seems like they were only used to get good advertisement for the movie but I seriously doubt that it worked though . Real ' monster ' of the movie is Groton played by Lon Chaney Jr . It's sad that this role had to be his last . Not a worthy ending for a wonderful career in horror-movies . The movie looks like it had a $100 budget and the computer effects looked like the ' Super Mario ' games . Regina Carrol is absolutely horrible as an actress and I'm sure that they cast her only because of her two , more talented screen fillers . Jim Davis isn't a bad actor but what was exactly the point of his character ? The movie is filled with some other more needless characters and the movie is filled with some pointless moments that adds very little to the story . Basically the movie is just very poorly made . Poorly directed and poorly edited at times and most certainly poorly acted . I kind of liked the ' James Bond ' like opening credits and music though !
What a mess from the early days of Eugene Levy's and Ivan Reitman's career .	It's amazing how many trash Eugene Levy starred in during his early career . He is now a well known comedy actors , mostly thanks to his role in the American Pie movies but it's quite amazing that he ever became a big actor once you see the stuff he starred in at the beginning of his career . It's also even more amazing to think that this movie is directed by Ivan Reitman , the man who later brought us the movies " Stripes " , " Ghostbusters " , " Dave " and the more recent comedy " My Super Ex-Girlfriend " . Only his trademark comedy style can be seen back in this movie . Furthermore this movie doesn't show much of Reitman's talent , which is also do of course to the movie its really bad script ( also partly written by Ivan Reitman himself ) and its obvious very limited money and resources . The movie lacks some good editing cuts and camera position among many other things . The movie looks like a bad ' 70's porn , without all of the sex ( but with the nudity ) . It's a real amateur like looking movie . Despite having comedy elements in it , this movie above all is a serious horror attempt from Ivan Reitman . Luckily he soon discovered his talent more lays at the comedy genre , or else we wouldn't had ever had the fine and classic comedies he made later in his career . But how can you even really regard this movie as an horror film , when it has so little gore ( well , at least for a cannibal flick ) in it and no scares at all . The movie basically has a non-existent story that is hard to follow because it just doesn't make an awful lot of sense all . You'll have a hard time understanding when the movie is in flashback mode and when it's set in real time and what's real and what's not . It's the sort of script that makes you wonder why they even decided to shoot it in the first place . It's a confusingly bad made movie , that often makes you go ; ' What's going on here ? ! ' . This movie is not at all what you could and should expect from a cannibal flick . It's just not an awfully interesting movie to watch , since too little interesting is ever happening in it . It's not even interesting as a study of an early Ivan Reitman movie . There is really no reason why you should ever watch this bad ' 70's flick .
Horrible tasteless movie .	I wonder how much this movie actually has got to do with the 1984 movie " Bachelor Party " , starring Tom Hanks . Is this movie even an official sequel ? This movie is lacking in every department and you're obviously better off not watching it . For a comedy this movie simply isn't good or funny enough . It relies mostly on the character's their stereotypical assessments , rather then the movie actually features some good , original and funny moments . Of course there also is very little story present and the movie nude breast than script pages . You just keep waiting for things to finally start off . There is a main plot line in it somewhere but that one is so terribly unoriginal and gets executed so poorly in the movie that it feels more as if it's something non-existent . I guess there even is a message and moral story in it somewhere but this again is so terribly unoriginal and poorly done in the movie that it simply does not work out . It's basically a typical teenage comedy , with lots of sex jokes and nudity , only without the teenage main characters , which makes the story all the more sad and tasteless . The movie makes some really wrong jokes , that are misplaced for any type of movie . I regret ever watching this .
Sophie Marceau has dropped down to this now days ?	The movie is apparently based on a popular French horror novel , by Arthur Bernède , from 1927 . Not that I had ever heard about it before but Belphégor has been a popular subject before for movies and mini-series . The first movie got released way back in 1927 , simultaneously with the novel . Arthur Bernède was a part of a group of writers who wrote and produced films and novels simultaneously . The character Belphégor is one of his best known creations . Once upon a time Sophie Marceau was a promising new European actress who would conquer Hollywood . She has now however dropped back again to movies like this one . Nothing wrong with playing in French quality movies , since it's the country she originates from but this movie is just ridicules . Problem is mostly that the movie relies on its special effects , to make the movie good and scary . Well , horror and special effects never really have been a good combination though , with some exceptions here and there . It's not like the special effects are bad in this one . Especially for an European movie it is simply good but it ; s just misplaced , since the movie gave the feeling it could had easily done without its effect . It would had actually made the movie a better and scarier one to watch , no doubt about that really . The movie is just not ever tense or engaging to watch , also since the movie seems to have difficulties picking the right approach . At times the movie picks a light and just less serious approach , while at others it clearly attempts to be a good scary horror movie . This is mostly the reason why the movie just doesn't work out on any level . You can say that the movie is even a bit boring . It all also definitely gets worse toward the ending . After a while you just stop caring about this movie and its story and you start wishing you had decided to watch something else instead . The editing seems totally off . It uses too fast cuts , without much style , while the fast editing was obviously intended to give the movie a good , modern style . Also the time-line is just plain messed up at times , as if some sequences got edited in the wrong order . The musical score is also really annoying and at times doesn't even sounds to fit the movie , as if it all long got scored before the movie finished shooting . I can't believe composer Bruno Coulais is an Oscar nominated composer . The musical score is almost just as annoying as the movie its sound effects . The movie is filled with many characters , which you however just couldn't care less about . It also just seems very unlikely that a woman like Sophie Marceau would ever fall for a man such as Frédéric Diefenthal . The movie also features Julie Christie , which is nice but just doesn't add much to the movie . A horrible watch .
Who comes up with this sort of stuff ?	The movie isn't afraid to steal from many other movies such as ; " Se7en " , " Hollow Man " and maybe perhaps even a bit of " Fallen " . A movie that steals a lot from other movies isn't by definition a bad one , I mean as long as its done to strengthens the movie and its story and characters , I tend to forgive them for that . To be honest , the movie also begin well but went downhill pretty fast about halve way through , when the movie was starting to hang together from its coincidences . There just happens to be a professor who is researching on how bringing the death back to life . That researcher just happens to work out the same school our ' main hero ' gets stationed as a guard . That professor just happens to pick the death body of the killer of our ' main hero's ' wife . In the end they desperately try to connect it all and make sense to all those too obvious coincidences but by then the movie has already lost all of its credibility . The movie is definitely a better looking one than just an average made for TV movie . It's style is what saved the movie until it was about halve way through . It's a thriller that at times even uses horror elements in it . A thriller with horror elements in it is most of the time an unlikely and daring combination that also not too often works out greatly . For most part the combination works out in this movie until , again , it reaches about the halve way point . Thought it was a watchable enough movie , until it just got sillier and sillier and worse and worse .
Awfully simple comedy .	This movie is rather unknown ( only 85 vote on IMDb at the moment ) and it should stay unknown . The movie is very simple . It's very predictable and for a comedy it has very few laughs . Also the style itself is simple and about as average as it can be . The story is not really good and doesn't always flow or makes sense and is filled with some rather big plot-holes . Jeff Goldblum on the other hand is good and comically talented and so is Burt Kwouk's ( Cato from the " Pink Panther " series ) in his small but fun role . But quite frankly all of it is not good enough to save this movie . It is no disaster but it's not recommendable either .
Is it a comedy or a drama ?	The filmmakers really didn't seemed to be able to make up their minds . At times the movie feels like a drama but at times and especially in the last 30 minutes the movie suddenly turns into a ( lame ) comedy . This movie is truly a waste of talent . There are a lot of good actors in this movie such as Demi Moore , Burt Reynolds , Armand Assante , Robert Patrick and Ving Rhames . Also the music by Howard Shore really isn't bad and deserved a better movie . The movie makes a really pointless impression . The story felt highly unlikely and the movie was filled with many implausible moments . Also it may sound weird but also all of those striptease sequence got really boring after a while and they felt like they were put in the movie to put some life in it . Unsuccessfully though . " Striptease " is a failed movie that doesn't take itself serious enough at times with as a result that the already flawed story becomes even more ridiculous at times . Still a tiny bit better than " Showgirls " though .
Haven't I seen this all somewhere else before ?	This is your pretty standard average run of the mill thriller , involving a plot to assassinate the president of the United States . Sounds familiar ? Of course it does . This movie doesn't handle anything that hasn't been handled before in any other similar genre movie . It's of course not like this movie is horribly bad or anything but it just isn't anything new and therefore this is a pretty redundant and forgettable movie to watch . Also because the movie just isn't very original , it also doesn't exactly make this movie an exciting one to watch . The movie even is a bit boring to watch to be honest and even though it's fast moving it still is a slow going movie because it often takes too long between sequences that any action or anything else good is happening . And then to think that people actually thought this was a serious Oscar contender before its release . All because Kiefer Sutherland was in it and this movie featured an " 24 " type of main plot . It's a typical modern , fast going , slick looking movie , with stupid high tech gadgets . The way they all get used are far from realistic , which is typical for a political modern Hollywood thriller . It's also the sort of movie that tries to make us believe that the secret service has all knowing and all seeing agents and all oh so well magically blend in with the crowed , despite big sunglasses and tough way of walking and looking around . Just a couple of things which always annoy me in movies and unfortunately this movie is also filled with . Problem is that the movie features a really far fetched and unnecessary made complicated plot . It's pretty stupid . At times you'll have difficulties understanding what is going on exactly . It takes away a lot of fun of the movie , which now takes itself far too serious instead . The fact that the story and approach of the movie is so far fetched makes this also a very unbelievable movie to watch . The movie focuses mainly on Michael Douglas and his view point , which means that the Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria get pushed to the background . A shame cause they in essence showed more potential and seemed more interesting . A very unoriginal , unexciting movie , that also takes itself too serious .
Bad as a kung fu movie , bad as a crime movie , bad as a whatever more movie .	After " The Matrix " there were a lot of movies who suddenly ignored the fact that there is actually a thing such as gravity . " Romeo Must Die " was one of the first mainstream movies to feature this , after " The Matrix " . To me it gives the movie more of a fake look rather than a spectacular one though . It's definitely a movie made for the MTV-generation . It's a noisy , fast movie with different songs like every 1 minute , that often don't even blend in with what's happening on the screen . It's like they had a quota of a certain amount of songs they had to put in the movie . Most of the songs are already sounding outdated by now , so just imaging how this movie would be like to watch in 10 years from now . Seems to me that all this Aaliyah gushing comes from the fact that she died in a plane crash one year after this movie . But lets be fair and objective for one moment , she just wasn't a very great actress . It's of course always a horrible thing when a person dies so young and under such horrible circumstances but it ain't exactly like James Dean has died here or anything like that . This movie was her acting debut and it was the only movie that got released during her lifetime . Let's not even get started on Jet Li . . . I already knew he just isn't a great actor and the only thing that gets him movie roles are of course his fighting skills , which certainly aren't lacking as much as his acting abilities . I'm getting kind of fed up with this great black actors appearing in these sort of productions , just because it's a ' black ' production and they are helping their brothers out . I mean come on Delroy Lindo can get and certainly also deserves better roles in better movies than this . He's potentially an Oscar winner but he obviously won't ever win one if he decided to go on and play roles in movies such as this one . Same thing to a lesser extend somewhat also goes for Isaiah Washington . None of the characters really work out because of the messy storytelling , in which a main plot only gets vaguely visible not until halve way through . Lots of characters seem to be redundant and the movie seems to have a hard time keeping its main focus on one thing and one main character . But oh well when you have an actor such as Jet Li playing the main role , you of course also can't really trust on it to let him carry the entire movie on his own . But also just the story on its own is hardly anything interesting and seems to be very typical for an action movie such as this one . Perhaps its also due to the fact that Andrzej Bartkowiak was still an inexperienced director that the movie did not worked out so well , especially story-wise . This was actually the first movie he did as a director . Bartkowiak mostly got his fame for working as a director of photography on mostly well known action movies such as " Speed " , " Lethal Weapon 4 " and other fine movies such as " The Devil's Advocate " , " Terms of Endearment " and " Species " . Seems like the Polish born Bartkowiak has completely retired from camera-work now to completely focus on his directing career . With movies such as " Exit Wounds " , " Cradle 2 the Grave " , " Doom " and this one behind his name he hasn't had much success with it yet though . I was also expecting some more action from this movie , also not in the least since it had Jet Li in the main role . But because the movie has a hard time keeping its focus and let things evolve around the Jet Li character , he actually gets far too little to do action wise . I was just expecting some more good fight sequences from the movie , although the movie of course obviously still features action moments like this . The movie was just not like I was expecting it to be and it also had actually very little romance in it . I was sort of expecting more of a modern Romeo and Juliet type of story ( like the movie its title also would suggest ) but instead the movie is more about some rivaling gangs and the NFL . . . do I need to say more ? Bad story flow , bad character handling , disappointing action and below par acting performances from most of the cast . Just an overall bad movie !
Poorly done sequel .	This first movie " Mimic " already wasn't a brilliant movie but it was about as good as its concept allowed it to be . Plus it had Guillermo del Toro at the helm directing , which injected some quality into the movie . It also had a nice horror setting ; the underground subway system . This movie has one major problem ; it doesn't know how to create any tension . It's build up is totally wrong . Things just happen in this movie and they happen way too quickly after each other . The movie always cuts right to the chase , which is also the reason why the movie itself is only 82 minutes short . The build up also certainly isn't helped by its at time weak editing and stupid camera positioning . It's not like the concept of this movie is any less silly than that of the first movie but at least the first movie still somewhat worked out , since it was a fine , formulaic though fine , crafted simple piece of horror . And no , of course having the movie set inside of a school at night is something totally different than a dark subway system . It's not the same horror atmosphere . Otherwise , the atmosphere within this movie is quite good . At least it does a decent job at re-creating the same dark atmosphere as within the first movie . The acting is unfortunately also below par . Alix Koromzay is fine and she is also definitely helped by her looks but Bruno Campos is horrible as an extreme stereotyped New York cop . The movie also makes some odd choices with its characters . Having 2 kids walk around at the school , trying to escape the mutated cockroaches just wasn't a great idea because you just know that they are not going to get killed off for the obvious reasons . The special effects and make-up effects on the other hand are real good . Especially when you consider that this is a straight-to-video flick . I remember that the first " Mimic " movie was quite fake looking in parts but I believe that also has to do with Guillermo del Toro's own unique style . All in all I just can't believe that they actually made a third movie after this . Oh well , at least that one apparently has Lance Henriksen still in it .
Poor Sean Connery , Poor Karl Malden , poor Natalie Wood and poor me for watching this .	In the ' 70's the disaster movie was a very popular genre . Just think about movies such as " Airport " , " The Poseidon Adventure " , " Earthquake " and " The Towering Inferno " . The ' 70's were already close to their end at the time of the release of this movie and the genre also already had its best moments clearly behind them . This movie just doesn't seem to realize this and lets all of the typical ' 70's genre moments feature in this movie . Like basically every ' 70's disaster movie , the movie features an all star cast , with in this case actors such as Sean Connery Karl Malden , Natalie Wood , Martin Landau , Trevor Howard and Henry Fonda involved . Not that it matters much though , since none of the actors exactly have their finest moment in this movie and they can't really make the movie it's silly story more credible . To be honest the story and its events often don't make much sense and it isn't exactly made more plausible by its special effects , which are just laughable bad . Yes I know it's an 1979 movie but surely better things as featured in this movie were possible , when you look at for instance at movies such as " Star Wars " , " Close Encounters of the Third Kind " and " 2001 : A Space Odyssey " , which all got made prior to this movie . The fact that this movie is done in such an horrible way makes the movie seem the more painfully ridicules and laughable actually . Strangely enough the movie doesn't focus much on any personal drama , something that normally was featured very prominently in ' 70's disaster flicks . It makes this movie also a very shallow and uninteresting experience . Why should you care about any of the characters ? Why should you care about the fact that the world is about to get destroyed by a meteor in this movie ? The movie now just mainly drags on instead all the time . I liked the musical score from Laurence Rosenthal though . It was a John Williams kind of sounding score . Williams composed for a lot of ' 70's disaster flicks such as the earlier mentioned " The Poseidon Adventure " , " Earthquake " and " The Towering Inferno " . Williams was also actually first set to compose the score for this movie . I do know now were Michael Bay got some of his inspiration from . A lot of trademark buildings and famous big cities gets hit by meteors and other natural disasters that go with it . But another laughable thing is that the movie is actually using archive footage of buildings getting demolished and it actually uses some footage from another disaster movie which got released only 1 year prior to this movie , called " Avalanche " , which by the way also seems like a real horrible movie . Yes , I'm definitely planning on seeing that movie ! Perhaps not as totally horrible as its reputation would suggest but nevertheless still a bad late ' 70's disaster flick .
What a mess .	What a cast . . . and what a waste of it . Seriously , when a movie has Gabriel Byrne , Jamie Foxx , Thandie Newton , Stuart Townsend , Hal Holbrook , Melanie Griffith and Sylvester Stallone in it you would expect some quality . The movie is however one big mess with a unlikely story that can't seem to stop putting twist and turns in it . Yeah , I think that they thought they were really being clever with all of it . The story is not only messy and unlikely , it also isn't exactly terribly original . It uses elements from earlier and much better poker game based movies . But to me it were really the many pointless twist and turns in the movie that did it . It made the story such an unlikely one to watch . On top of that the script remains filled with a lot of holes silly poker game errors and things that just don't make an awful lot of sense . Why would any one above all things want to play against a card player that is known as the best cheater in the game . This is what the movie is about and builds up to but just didn't ever made a lot of sense to me . Despite that the movie has a great cast , it still feels as if most actors were miscast in their roles . I don't know what it is about Stuart Townsend . He is a good actor but in most roles he plays he always feels out of place . Perhaps it are his looks , I don't known . This basically also was the reason why he got replaced in " The Lord of the Rings : The Fellowship of the Ring " . Also Thandie Newton isn't much good and actually quite annoying in her ' strong ' female role . And what was the point of having Melanie Griffith in this ? Oh , I guess I could go on about the movie its casting and could complaining even some more about the way too limited screen time the Jamie Foxx character gets but I guess you get my point by now . Damian Nieman just isn't much of an original writer / director and on top of that he also doesn't handle his own material very well . Scenes often feel disjointed , it tries to put in way too many characters and everything about the movie is shallow and in a way predictable . On top of that the movie features some bad editing at times , which also doesn't help to make this movie look like one seamless whole . The movie was also one major box office bomb and no wonder that Damian Nieman hasn't made a movie ever since . A too big mess to make you enjoy this movie .
Peter Cushing and vampire lesbians , what an odd combination .	" The Vampire Lovers " is an original Hammer movie because it has a very much present lesbian undertone and storyline . But is the movie itself much good ? Not always . It's a pretty uneven movie with some nice elements in it but overall it leaves too many loose ends and its story drags too much at some points , which all doesn't make this movie the most pleasant of the Hammer movies to watch . The movie is fairly slow and never really finds the right pace . Even though the movie is just 91 minutes short , it feels much longer . There simply happens to little exciting or interesting enough in the story . But main problem I had with this movie was that it lacked a real main character . There isn't really a ' hero ' present in the movie and the movie keeps switching between different characters , which makes it uneasy for us the viewer to really feel for any of the characters . It also doesn't make the movie exactly a terribly exciting one to watch . It was pretty nice to see Peter Cushing going Van Helsing-style again toward the ending of the movie but still his presence in the movie makes a pointless impression . Also a totally pointless impression made John Forbes-Robertson as the ' Man in Black ' . The presence of his character and his purpose is never explained in the movie . I suppose that his character was supposed to be Count Dracula ? We shall perhaps never know . . . The movie does have some nice elements in it and some good movie-tricks and little story-twists at times , so the movie is not a complete bore or disaster to watch . The way of storytelling might perhaps be not the best but still the story is one of the things which makes this movie good and original enough to still watch it .
Too much jumping around and too little substance .	I won't deny it that " Madagascar " is a fun movie to watch , which is mainly thanks to the characters that are in it but it isn't exactly a very memorable movie with some genius comical moments in it . It is mainly because of the story that this movie isn't one of the best animated movie , of the last couple of years . The story is very flat and it lacks a good clear main plot line . The movie is basically heading nowhere and I can imaging that most children will be bored at times while watching this movie . Most of the ( good ) jokes in the movie are the kind of jokes only adults will understand . The four main characters are really good and they all have some good chemistry on screen . They are all perfectly voiced by actors who really fitted the characters . But especially fun are the characters who play small parts in the movie such as the 2 monkeys , the penguins and the lemurs . The movie is fast paced and is mostly filled with the characters jumping and running quick on the screen . Is that fun and good enough to fill a whole movie with ? I don't think so . The movie is fast but nothing ever is really happening . That's why the movie itself is also quite short in running time . The animations are also a disappointment . There are very little details in it and it's hard to believe that this movie comes from the same studio as " Shrek 2 " and " Shark Tale " who were even made before this movie . I'll probably still watch " Madagascar 2 " but I wont be camping in line for it .
Singing Mounties . . . oh dear !	Aren't singing Mounties the first sign of the Apocalypse ? This is a below average standard MGM musical , from the period when the genre was already dying . Problem is that the movie really lacks a good story . It's not until the second halve that the movie is finally starting to show some progress and some plot lines but it's then already too late to still really make something good of the movie . The love story , which is always essential in this type of movies , isn't much interesting which is due to the characters and actors that portray them . Ann Blyth is mostly irritating with her thick overdone French-Canadian accent , that by the way seems to come and go randomly . She also doesn't look convincing enough as a woman who feels at home in the wilderness . She looks far too timid and pretty for that . Also hard to imaging that she would really fall and really become happy with such a ' criminal ' as Duval . The character treatment is also quite poor . Seemingly important characters just suddenly disappear out of the movie for too long and basically all characters are extreme stereotypes . You know it's one of those musicals in which the characters just suddenly burst into singing , in the middle of some dialog , to express their thoughts and feelings . This always have been quite ridicules in my book . The movie does get extra points for its environment . The Canadian natures serves as a beautiful backdrop for this movie ! Not a complete waste of time but still a below average late MGM attempt .
Not enough happening in this movie .	I remember when this movie first trailers came around . It looked like a fun movie but above all also a fast paced one with lots of action and thriller elements . However very little of this can be seen back into this movie . A really wasted opportunity , for it's premise was a good one and a rather interestingly original one as well . Maybe I expected too much , since Kevin Williamson , the man behind the Scream movies was at the helm of this movie . The movie turned out to be not quite good or tense enough for a thriller and too serious and weak for a fun comedy . Therefor I can't help regarding " Teaching Mrs . Tingle " as a failed movie , that misses its target . They could had done so much interesting with this movie its story but basically rarely anything tense or remarkable occurs . Mrs . Tingle spends about three quarters of the movie lying tied on bed . They could have let here character manipulate all of the students in a slick and bitchy way , to set them up against each other . The movie does this but it really doesn't go far enough in this . The movie remains pretty shallow because of this and it lacks some good tension and creativity . Not that it's boring but it isn't terrible interesting either . It's also a waste of Helen Mirren's talent . This is not a role we see her often in . She does provide the movie with some really excellent moments but the script offers her little really interesting to do . Nothing wrong with the rest of the cast either really . Katie Holmes really isn't bad in it and so isn't Barry Watson , who I think they tried to launch as the new Johnny Depp , who also started his career in a movie with a similar style as this one ; " A Nightmare on Elm Street " but he never made it and he already is a forgotten actor . Jeffrey Tambor plays a fun role and so does Molly Ringwald , who's role is obviously referring to her image of queen of high-school movies . The movie could had really used some more pace , action and tension . It now instead is a rather shallow movie in which too little ( interesting ) is happening . It still is a somewhat fun movie to watch and obviously not one to take very serious but it all isn't quite enough to make this movie stand out .
Only watchable to true fans of the genre .	This take on the famous Frankenstein story is certainly an odd one . The acting is for most of the time absolutely horrible . All of the actors are terribly overacting , especially Arno Juerging , which makes it hard to take this movie seriously . I wouldn't exactly call this movie a campy one but the acting abilities certainly reminds me of some of the worst campy movies from the ' 50's of the previous century . The movie is a real rare gore-fest . Tons of blood are used and the movie features lots of dismembered body parts and insides hanging out of bodies . It's all quite fake looking but that's also one of the reasons why this movie should be appealing to fans of good old fashioned gory movies . Like you could expect from a movie with Andy Warhol's name attached to it , there is also lots of nudity of provocative sequences , such as when Baron Frankenstein makes love to one of his zombie creations . ( Yes , the Frankenstein monsters are referred to as zombies in this one . ) The story is told slowly , a bit too slow perhaps . Most of the time there isn't really happening anything interesting on screen and the movie seems to take forever without heading really somewhere . It does make this movie a boring one to watch for most of the time and that's why this movie is only watchable to true fans of the genre . The movie features some certainly unique sequences and a not so bad ending . It most certainly isn't a movie for just everyone . It's odd , gory and provocative . The acting is horrible and the dialog is laughable bad at times . Clearly a movie for fans of the genre only , even though also they will have to come to the conclusion that " Flesh for Frankenstein " is far from the best movie of all time . Oh well , it at least still has Udo Kier in it !
Great kids movie .	Entertaining movie that especially the kids will like . The story is simple and easy to follow without any logic . In other words a appealing nonsense movie for kids that want to have a good time . Luckily there also are some jokes for the adults . Especially the " Patton " scene in which composer Jerry Goldsmith spoofs himself is priceless . Director Joe Dante goes " Gremlins " style again , although he uses the same elements the movie is not near as good but it certainly has the same amount of fun , maybe even more . What makes the movie are the wonderful toys . The Commando Elite is certainly a great piece of toy that kids will find very appealing . The Gorgonites are pretty lame and a bit too childish at times but luckily the movie focuses more on The Commando Elite . What makes the toys really cool is the wonderful voice cast , Tommy Lee Jones is really awesome as Maj . Chip Hazard , the leader of the gang . The " human " cast is also great . It has a great kid cast and the parents are portrayed very entertaining especially Phil Hartman ( RIP ) and Wendy Schaal as Phil and Marion Fimple . Jay Mohr and David Cross are also good for some comical situations . The special effects are also wonderful . The toys really come alive in a way you couldn't possibly imaging . Stereotype kids movie with an easy to follow story that maybe at some points is a bit too childish but very appealing to kids nevertheless .
Has the quality of the Shrek movies but the story is too simple and sappy .	It was sort of surprising to see that this movie fairly much had the same visual quality as all of the other ' normal ' Shrek movies . Quite surprising for a 30 minutes made for TV Christmas special . In that regard the fans of the Shrek movies will most likely also not be disappointed with this movie . The movie of course also features lots of the typical Shrek-humor and comical moments . Also of course great that all of the actors from the Shrek movies lend their voices to this special . Mike Myers , Eddie Murphy , Cameron Diaz , Antonio Banderas , they are all here . But it are mostly the secondary characters that make this movie fun to watch . Characters such as the Gingerbread Man and Pinocchio provide the movie with its most fun moments . Just too bad about the simple and cheesy story . The Shrek movies were all obviously aimed toward the sort of ' older kids ' and more mature audience while this story is obviously aimed toward much younger children . It's just too simplistic and candy sweet all . The story mostly doesn't work out due to the fact that you'll find yourself mostly on Shrek's side rather than Fiona's , which was not what the makers intended . I can only say that the movie gets amusing when some of the character sort of give their own interpretation of their Christmas story and experiences but other than that the story doesn't really deserve much credit . It's just too obvious all . The movie tries to shove down the Christmas message trough our throats . It feels forced and not like the sweet little fun charming movie that it really could had been . Now instead the movie has basically little to offer or at least no more than any other Christmas TV / movie special , which doesn't take anything away from the quality or the fact that this still remains a perfectly watchable short movie .
Having a twist at the end does't automatically mean the movie as a whole is clever or well written .	All that praise for this movie . . . while it in my opinion is nothing more than a simple written but very well directed heist movie which cast and style still make this an entertaining enough and certainly watchable movie . It however is a movie with a tad more misses than hits really . Main problem for me was the story . Over and over again it is told in the movie that this is the perfect bank robbery . Quite frankly I really don't see back in the movie why exactly the plan is such a brilliant one . Also the twist at the end left me cold and it was far from satisfying for me . I found the story to be simple and formulaic written . The movie tried to make itself seem more complex and clever but putting some non-linear story lines in the movie but its all not enough to make the story seem more interesting or any more clever . Spike Lee's directing however certainly spiced things up and manged to give the movie still some flair and an excellent ' cool ' atmosphere . Nevertheless the movie and its story just didn't hit me as clever , surprising or perfectly solidly written , which made the movie as a whole to me a bit simple although it certainly still was perfectly entertaining to watch . " Inside Man " isn't really a movie that allows itself to be put in a corner . It's hard to classify this movie as to what genre it is . As a thriller it isn't tense enough and as a crime movie it isn't clever and tough enough . For most part the movie is mostly entertaining to watch but than again at the same time the movie tries to handle some more serious and delicate matters . Best example of this are of course the racial and discriminating issues , a returning element in Spike Lee movies . The moments felt forced , out of place and totally unneeded . Because this movie doesn't really fit in a genre its hard to known how and with what approach or distance to watch this movie . The cast is impressive , perhaps a bit too . Denzel Washington is perfectly in his element , as yet again a police detective . He seems to be getting with every movie I see him in . Clive Owen isn't as impressive but he is a good actor and he plays his role convincing and ' cool ' enough . The movie also has Jodie Foster and Christopher Plummer in it but it makes you wonder why . Their roles are small and don't seem significant enough , even though they play an important part in the story . This is mainly because their screen time is too limited and it feels like a huge waste of talent . Jodie Foster normally picks her roles very carefully and it makes me wonder why she ever agreed to be in this movie . Willem Dafoe on the other hand again is a perfect , pleasant and most welcome addition to the star-filled cast . This movie still shows that Spike Lee is a great talented director with a nose for the business . This unfortunately in this case only shows in its style . The movie has some great executed - and almost artistically style-full sequences . It to me was the only reason why this movie still was a good - and entertaining enough movie to watch , for the story and its character left me cold mostly . Simple entertainment . Style-full but not solid .
Not a bad movie . . . too bad the story is too weak at times .	This actually is a worthy sequel to " Dragonheart " . OK it misses the magical atmosphere , good special effects and cast but it still is a movie worth seeing . Good things about the movie are the nicely choreographed fight sequence's and the pretty solid and satisfying end fight . Also the movie provides some successful comical moments . Still there are some major flaws in the movie . The story itself about the prophecy is quite weak and silly and it's hard to tell at times who are exactly the bad guys , due to some poor casting and bad story telling . Some of the scene's were also edited poorly together . The special effects are far from the best ever but also far from the worst . They look acceptable enough . Robby Benson ( best know for voicing the beast in Disney's " Beauty and the Beast " . ) wasn't exactly the best choice to voice Drake , he's boring and makes some of the dialog sound silly . Overall the acting is pretty solid by the rest of the cast , of unknown actors . With some more work on the script , this movie could have been really great . I certainly wouldn't mind seeing a third " Dragonheart " movie being made .
Good looking but far too boring all .	To be perfectly honest , this was one of the most tiresome movies I have seen in a long while . It's a long and slow movie , that doesn't feature enough humor , drama or action . Instead it mixes all of these genre together but it's just not using enough of any of it . I'm sure I would had adored this movie if it only had some more comedy in it . It had all of the right type of characters for it but yet somehow the movie doesn't decide to push it through . Instead now the comedy works out often more as annoying than anything else really . The movie is completely character driven but the movie reaches a point that I just don't care about the character anymore . I don't care much about his love life , his military career . In that regard this movie in my eyes already is a failure . It just couldn't hold my interest . The movie too often drivels around too much and the movie feels quite bloated . It's made to look bigger than it in fact truly all is . Some sequences go on for far too long , without making an impression , or leave a significant enough purpose . And the movie doesn't get any better as it heads toward its ending . On the contrary , I would say . The movie tells basically the entire lifespan of a military man , from a young ambitious officer to a more realistic gray , fat , retired army colonel . We see him not only grow as a military man but also as a person , as he meets new people throughout his life and re-encounters a German officer and later friend , at various points throughout his career . This could had all provided a movie with an intriguing story and characters but because its so tiresome all , it just doesn't ever really work out as it was supposed to . Having said all of that ; it's a quite good looking movie . It's a movie that got made back in 1943 but yet it got shot in full color . This certainly gives the movie something extra . It has a great look , which not in the least is also due to some fine cinematography , from Oscar-winner Georges Périnal . He was a person who was already doing color movies in the late ' 30's . I just didn't liked this movie as much as everyone else seems to do .
Some good film-making , too bad about the main story .	No doubt Paddy Breathnach watched some Guy Ritchie . The style and storytelling is obviously the same . I don't mind this , since it's an excellent and above all very entertaining style of film-making . Obviously it's not as good as a Guy Ritchie movie of the same style but it's surely entertaining enough . It's not as good since the comedy in the movie feels more forced and planned out , rather than that it's cleverly and subtle written throughout the story . The events happen as comical moments rather than just moments that happen to the main characters . But of course you should perhaps not compare this too much to a Guy Ritchie and more regard it as a movie on its own . After all , it's Irish and therefor has a totally different atmosphere and lingo as well . In that regard this movie is just simply a well made and definitely entertaining one . But was dog racing the best backdrop and choice for the main story ? I don't think so . Some sports are not really sports in my opinion and therefor couldn't care any less about the movie its plot . I also couldn't care too much for the movie it's main characters . The actors portraying them are obviously not amongst the most talented , though they do a fair enough job playing average , regular ' normal ' persons . So it's definitely a movie with some pluses and minuses . The style and fun in this movie is definitely good and makes this an enjoyable watch . I only wished the movie had picked another main-plot , to also make the movie more compelling and interesting and perhaps even a bit more exciting to watch . After all , with these kinds of movies involving ' sports ' featuring an underdog , you already exactly know in advance how it's going to end . A pleasant watch but unfortunately no more than that .
An improvement over the first .	I had seen the first movie and didn't liked it at all . Still I decided to go and give this movie a chance , to see if they had improvement anything . I was pleasantly surprised to find out that they actually did . The story is better and more interesting and the monsters and CGI-effects in general are more convincing looking . The humor has also been improved and this movie actually does have some entertaining and funny moments in it . Not only the story itself has been improved but also the storytelling . The pace is good and the characters work better for this movie . Also the actors seemed more at ease in their roles . Freddie Prinze Jr . and Sarah Michelle Gellar certainly improved their acting compared to the first movie . Still best parts are played by Matthew Lillard and the perfectly cast Linda Cardellini . Plus of the movie is that it also has actors Alicia Silverstone , Tim Blake Nelson and Seth Green in it . The monsters are enjoyable and are good looking . There still are some ' fake ' moments but on the other hand there also are some truly spectacular looking sequences involving monsters . The character of Scooby-Doo himself is also looking more convincingly this time . It's not really a memorable or great movie but it is simple good entertainment to watch .
Good and watchable but the movie gives you the feeling it all could had been done better .	The movie is directed by Richard Quine , who simply isn't among one of the most talented directors who ever worked on a Columbo movie . Despite this he directed a total of 3 Columbo movies , so he must have done something right in the mind of the creators and studio bosses or he must have had friends in right places . To me it seemed that he didn't really understood the Columbo character right and often overdid things involving the famous character , mostly with his intelligence and perception of things . He also in some ways differ from the usual Columbo formula , which just isn't always for the good . It isn't among the fastest going or best flowing Columbo movies but this is mostly being compensated by the acting and scenes with Anne Baxter and Kevin McCarthy . Both of them are a bit of forgotten stars , who also never reached true stardom but did their share of good movies and played some fine roles . It's mostly their movie , which also sort of means that Peter Falk is playing third violin in this one . This especially shows in the sequences when the three of them are together on screen . Another indication of that Richard Quine didn't really knew how to handle the character right ( His car also looks dirtier than ever before by the way ) . It features a good and quite non-formulaic Columbo murder-mystery story that however due to its treatment and pace just never really gets of the ground . Some minor script changes and a different director at the helm could had made this a true great and original Columbo movie entry ! It features a story that is set in the world of Hollywood and movie-making and therefor also features some good egocentric characters who think they own the world and can get away with anything , even murder . No it's really not one of the worst Columbo movies out there and it simply is just a bit below the usual Columbo movie standard in the long run and it's also definitely a big step up from Richard Quine's other Columbo movie " Columbo : Dagger of the Mind " but it still leaves you with the feeling that it all could had been done better , which makes this movie perhaps still somewhat disappointing to watch .
Would had been nice if it had an actual story in it .	This is a rather good genre attempt , that is good looking and for the fans of the genre is still a good watch , but overall it's lacking too much with its story-telling to consider this a truly successful and great genre attempt . I think one of the problems with this movie is that it can't seem to decide for itself whether it wants to take on a serious and realistic approach or a more entertaining one . Result of this is that the movie features both of these very different approaches in it . Needless to say it doesn't blend in very well with each other . The one moment the movie is tense and unpredictable , the other its over-the-top and not really very credible . But perhaps the foremost problem is simply the movie its story and how it flows . Things are just happening within this movie . Nothing is really ever being explained and it's not the type of movie that has a clear main plot line in it . It's about a very small town in Alaska being under the sudden attack of a group of vampires , during 30 days of night . This is the story . Nothing more , nothing less . It may sound good and simple enough for the lovers of the genre but the movie and its characters are all over the place . It's as if some sequences are missing at times within the movie and the movie often makes too big jumps . The one moment they are hiding in the police station , the other they are at an attic and then again at a totally different place . The movie often doesn't bother showing how things happened . You'll also never feel attached to any of the characters really , since most of them remain very shallow and unknown ones . I mean , I surely don't know all the characters names within this movie , even those who have quite an amount of running time in this movie . I'm of course not talking about Josh Hartnett and Melissa George characters , etcetera , but about the rest of the townsfolk , who are hiding and trying to survive along with them . It makes this movie a somewhat shallow experience at times . But no , none of this really takes away the fun of the movie . This is why the movie is still perfectly watchable for the fans of the genre . It's a good looking movie , that obviously wasn't cheap to made . The movie has some good make-up effects in it as well as some other nice effective gory special effects . Yes , the movie does feature some nice gore but this is not what the movie is all about . It's being somewhat pushed to the background and the movie is more about the survival of a group of people under some very unusual circumstances . The movie constantly sticks to its main characters , which is also the reason why nothing is ever rarely being explained in the movie . Things are just simply happening within this movie , just as they are happening to the movie its main characters . The movie is based on a comic by Steve Niles & Ben Templesmith and the movie must have obviously sticked to its original source material . This approach taken by the story might work out fine and effective within a comic book but for a motion picture it's simply too lacking and not effective enough . Probably the reason why a lot of studios didn't really picked up this movie when being offered the change to produce it by the comic book authors . It's nice to see how much Josh Hartnett as an actor has matured over the years . I don't think I've ever seen him in a movie ever since 2001 ( with the expectation of his 2 minutes role in the 2005 hit movie " Sin City " ) and to me in my mind , Hartnett was still that very young actor who made teenage-girls drool with his role in " Pearl Harbor " . It's nice to see that by now he has really become a man and is more serious and matured in his acting performances as well . He positively surprised me in this movie . Could had been a great genre movie with a different approach and an actual clear main plot-line in it .
A bit of an overdone Columbo entry .	Out of all Columbo movie this one perhaps is the one with the most B-movie like feeling over it , at least in the movie its opening minutes in which the actual murder , like always , occurs . It makes the movie feel kind of lame and overdone with all of its usual Columbo movie ingredients . Everything , from its emotions to its humor feels completely overdone , making this one of the less great Columbo movies to watch . For some reason this movie reminded me more of a " The A-Team " episode , or anything other episode from a typical ' 80's series . Not that the story is that bad . It's a story that is consistent with all other Columbo movies and it follows he usual successful formula , which made the series last for all together 5 decades . The movie actually a quite ingenious murdering plot . No big wonder , since the murder this time is being committed by a defense lawyer who has never lost a murder case in his entire career , so he should know a trick or two when it comes down to committing ' the perfect murder ' . The story also has some nice twists to it , which also makes this movie to be a bit more different and original than the usual Columbo movie entry . But there of course is no such thing as a ' perfect murder ' with Lt . Columbo around . Peter Falk is great as always as the scruffy-looking homicide detective . Basically it doesn't matter if you're watching a ' 70's , ' 80's or ' 90's Columbo entry , Peter Falk is simply Columbo and his character hasn't changed a bit since Falk's first appearance as the most famous LAPD Lieutenant , in 1968 . Luckily the movie also gets better as it progresses and it slowly but steadily is finding back its good old form . It saves this movie from being truly among the most horrible Columbo movie entries and it actually in all honesty is still a perfectly watchable one , despite some of its weaknesses and flaws . It then however unfortunately starts to become worse an overdone again after about an hour into the movie . The movie also starts to make some odd choices with its story and it decides to throw in some more plot-lines and twists but then again decides to do nothing with it later on in the movie . For instance the movie its title is " Columbo : Columbo and the Murder of a Rock Star " and indeed the murder victim within this movie is a rock star but the movie decides to do absolutely nothing with this fact , which makes the title and whole fact that the victim is a rock star seems totally pointless . It also doesn't explain everything . Normally we as the viewers always get to see how the murderer is trying to cover up his action but not in this movie . In this movie things are just happening without explaining it , or showing how it got done . Also the movie its murderer , played by Dabney Coleman often suddenly disappears in the movie for far too long because the movie decides to take on some different angles . A Columbo movie is often driven by the interaction between the murderer and the Columbo character . In this movie this theme just doesn't get handled well enough . Dabney Coleman plays a good role opposite Peter Falk and he is perfectly cast in the role of middle ages lawyer , that like so many successful man of ' old age ' , is having an affair with a much younger woman than is good for him . Unfortunately the rest of the cast doesn't really know to impress and is the reason why the movie at times is feeling a bit more B-movie like . Shera Danese , who is married to Peter Falk , also appears in this movie again . She appeared in a total of 6 different Columbo movies , in totally different roles . She unfortunately just isn't as talented as her husband is though . Little Richard also makes a small appearance in this movie as himself , which works out quite annoying and distracting for the movie though . A watchable Columbo movie entry but not overall consistent enough to consider this movie really among the best out of the series .
Fair enough little WW I production .	When looking at this movie , it becomes obvious that it didn't had a very high budget . Not only its settings are kept cheap and simple but also the overall style and atmosphere of the movie . Nevertheless the movie is good enough and also serves its purpose well enough . In my opinion it's always interesting to watch a movie about WW I , since it's a subject that doesn't get much lighted in movies too often . It usually are small European productions like this one that handle the subject . It in my opinion makes WW I an underused part of history in the movie making business . It's a slowly told movie , set purely in British trench during WW I , in France , in the days before the battle of the Somme . One of the bloodiest battles in human history , with over one million casualties . Because the story is slow and set mainly at one location , it allows the movie to deepen its characters out and allow the actors to do their job and carry the movie . It's however definitely true that the movie is filled with far too many characters to put in a 100 minutes short movie . I'm sure the story and all of its characters would had worked out fine in a mini-series but it's a bit too much to put in a movie . It has as a result that none of the characters ever get really interesting - or fleshed out good enough to care about them . It makes the movie emotionally flat and even also quite boring at certain points , also since not really that much interesting is happening in the movie . The dialog and situations are also far too cliché to consider them good or original . The movie offers very little surprises and it makes " The Trench " perhaps a bit of an obsolete movie to watch . The actors still do their very best to carry the movie to an higher level . Daniel Craig is really superb in his role and he provides the movie still with some much needed emotions . It was also fun to see Cillian Murphy in a small and early role . Obviously too small to really make a lasting impression though . And than about the end battle . Well , when looking at this movie you should know better than to expect a big spectacular ending . If you already watched the first 90 minutes of this movie , you just know you're plain wrong to expect suddenly something big and spectacular . So in my opinion the ending just felt right and it was suiting with the rest of the movie . But obviously , it doesn't do much justice to the real battle of the Somme that was one of the biggest of WW I and also one of the bloodiest in human history . This obviously really doesn't show on screen however . Good enough to kill some time with . Just don't expect anything spectacular or emotionally powerful .
Weak story and perhaps only watchable for the fans of the genre .	The father would not be proud of his son . The story is extremely weak and to be honest I didn't liked it . I mean , come on , is Alucard / Dracula junior deliberately trying to get in trouble ? Its not like he's avoiding problems , instead he creates them on his own in this movie without even worrying about them . Another disappointingly weak element in the movie is the main lead played by Lon Chaney Jr . this time . He has absolutely no charisma as the famous blood sucking Count and he perhaps made the story even less likable . Just like in so many other Dracula movies it are the professors that steal the show . Their character are certainly the most likable and realistic ones and the actors that portray them ( Frank Craven and J . Edward Bromberg ) are very good ! The story is just simply lacking too much and at times is even laughable bad . Still there is plenty to enjoy for the fans of the genre , such as the typical horror atmosphere and some phony but fun looking early special effects . Nevertheless , you are probably better of watching the other ' Son of ' movie ; " Son of Frankenstein " or the other official sequel to " Dracula " ; " Dracula's Daughter " .
Well made - but lack-lusting ' 70's genre movie .	This movie is another fine example of typical ' 70's movie making . The movie is however far from a ' 70's classic . The story is too poor for that and the movie overall lacks some action . It's not that the pace of the movie is kept low . The movie is fast enough and its well directed and constructed . It however is a rare ' 70's lack-lusting genre movie , in which you're just waiting for a chase of gunfight to happen , that just never comes . It's of course not that I feel that every single movie needs to have some action in it but some action wouldn't had been out of place in this one . It's fitting and sort of needed for a typical ' 70's genre thriller movie such as this one . The story is actually a pretty odd one once you really start thinking about it . It's rather simplistic , which also makes it far from credible and perhaps even makes it a bit laughable . Yet the movie is perfectly watchable . Everything about it is very professional and its a well crafted movie . It isn't Sydney Pollack's best work but he knows how to deal with the genre . The movie has a perfect sense of realism , despite its weaker unbelievable story . Also nothing wrong with the cinematography from ' 70's big-man Owen Roizman . Also refreshing to see a ' 70's genre movie for a chance that isn't stuck in one place or city . Robert Redford plays the main role of the movie well and he truly carries the movie . Also Max von Sydow plays a good and interesting role . Really no must-see but it's a well made movie that's worth seeing .
Greatly watchable adventurous movie , that could perhaps had used some more adventure and action though in parts .	This is a perfectly watchable adventurous movie to watch , with a great cast and a good story , based on true events . It's interesting to note that the story of the movie is based on true events . It's above all for most part an adventurous story , with all of the usual ingredients you would expect from an adventurous movies set in an Arabic world . So , lots of sword fighting , good old fashioned honor , religion and a rich proud country . But the movie is also filled with humor , to make the movie a light and pleasant one to watch . The constant cutting back and forth between the Morocco plot involving Sean Connery and Candice Berger and the American plot line involving Theodore Roosevelt ( Brian Keith ) wasn't the best possible approach in my opinion . The two things have totally different paces , totally different characters , it are just totally different worlds ! Of course both story lines are connected and focuses on the same thing but the contrast between the two worlds is just too big to let it work out . It doesn't at all times make the movie feel connected and a bit disjointed . The American plot line is most of the time more political while the Morrocan plot line is purely adventurous and action filled . In the end you could perhaps even wonder what the whole point or Roosevelt in this movie was . Seem that John Milius is just a big admirer of him . Often the American plot line would take away most of the pace out of the far more interesting and more action filled fast paced Morrocan plot line . After all , John Milius always has been at his best as an action director . It isn't until halve way through that the movie fully gets on steam . The most - and largest scaled action of the movie then kicks in . Especially the large scale end battle does not disappoint . I wish the entire movie was like this . That way this movie would had also been a better known one , no doubt . The movie has a great Jerry Goldsmith musical score , that is perhaps way better known than the actual movie itself . The movie is also a good looking one with great production design and nice looking action and battle sequences in it . Appereantly the movie only costs $4 , 000 , 000 to make but that is really hard to believe , considering the settings and size of the movie . I mean John Milius his best known movie " Conan the Barbarian " cost about $20 , 000 , 000 to make but was a far more campy looking one and was less impressive on its scale . Quite funny to see an Arabic speak with a big fat Scottish accent but hey , it's Sean Connery so you just simply tend to accept this . He suits his role well . So does Candice Bergen . It's always hard for a female character to come across as believable and work out in a movie such as this one but she manages . Also John Huston plays a great role in this movie ! A perfectly fine watchable movie !
Good but certainly not the best the genre has to offer .	This type of movies were very popular in the late ' 30's and early ' 40's . Lots of classics were made during that time period and lots of actors got launched to stardom , thanks to movies like this . However as far as ' 40's screwball comedies are concerned ; this really isn't the best movie that the genre has to offer . Sure , it's all good and fun but it's just lacking this bit of cleverness and true hilarity . Blame the script for this . Mostly these type of movies are brilliantly constructed story-wise and its main characters stumble from the one odd and hilarious situation into the other . Same is also the case with this movie but it just isn't quite all as hilarious and well flowing as you would expect . Some sequences are too long and too often the movies stays too much at the same place . This is the foremost reason why it feels as if this movie isn't always flowing that well . As an indirect result of this , some characters feel like they are being used , while others feel like they are being overused . The story often feels like it could had made its point earlier and reached what it tried to achieve much earlier . Because of this it takes awhile for the story to really get off the ground . Sure , it's still a fun and entertaining movie to watch though . It's nothing too hilarious but good enough nevertheless for more than a couple of laughs . The fans of the genre will therefore also not be disappointed with this movie . Guess I'm just not Preston Sturges ' biggest fan when it comes down to his screwball comedies . I also thought his other acclaimed screwball comedy " Sullivan's Travels " , which he made one year prior to this movie , is a tad bit overrated . Both movies also star Joel McCrea , who wasn't the biggest actor within the game but he nevertheless is a great leading man , with also the right psychics . Not really sure why he never really truly broke through like an actor . He's mostly known for his work in some early westerns . It's all good and fun but there are some better genre movies to watch out there in my opinion .
Enjoyable movie .	This is an enjoyable little Italian / Swiss production , that mostly gets carried by its characters . The movie is sweet , little and innocent . In other words , perfect harmless entertainment . The movie feels warm and sincere , this is due to the setting of the movie ( Venice ) and its characters , that are all far from perfect but because of that also very humane and in this case also enjoyably quirky at times . The movie is mostly comical with its characters . They are over-the-top but at the same time kept humane . It helps to make the movie an enjoyable one to watch and at the same time also keeps sure that the emotions of the movie feel real . The movie features a nice story in which a married mother escapes her normal everyday life after she has been forgotten during a vacation by the tour bus . She decides to take advantage of the situation by hitchhiking to Venic , the city she always wanted to visit . perhaps for the first time ever in her life she feels herself alive and home somewhere , where she really can be herself . She decides to stay for a day but the day soon becomes days and the days weeks . For a change the movie centrally features a love-story between 2 persons at age and not persons who are still in the prime of their life and are in their early 20's , or something . It's refreshing , dramatic more powerful and involving and in a way also sweeter . Licia Maglietta is a good leading lady for the movie . and she forms a good couple with Bruno Ganz , who is halve Swiss , halve Italian and by far has the best lines of the movie , that almost sound poetic like . The rest of the supporting actors are mainly for the fun but everyone does a good job at portraying them . The movie is however not the best made and constructed one . At times they simply choose not to show some of the dramatic responses and just cut away and goes forward in time or back to another location . In my opinion this is a sign of weakness of the film-maker's skills and it's also definitely due to the editing that the movie does not work out at all times . Nevertheless , you should be able to appreciate and enjoy watching this movie .
Original early thriller by John Sturges , starring Ethel Barrymore in a late role .	The movie begins like a very typical Victorian-like costume movie , with real ladies and gentlemen but soon the movie makes a thriller turn , which makes the movie as a whole a surprising and fine contrasting one . It has a real good thriller story , that above all is also really original and everything gets uplifted all by its settings and time-period it is set in . Even though this movie was from 1951 , the movie certainly looks and feels like a ' 30's / ' 40's movie . It's in black & white , has Victorian settings and has ' 30's / ' 40's big time movie star Ethel Barrymore in it . The style of film-making and the way things are set up are also done in an old fashioned , as the overall visual style and atmosphere of the movie . Basically the only thing that gives away that this is a ' 50's movie is that Angela Lansbury is in it as well . It's an early thriller that works mostly out because of its original as well as intriguing story about a ' poor ' man and his wife and baby who are kindly given shelter by an elderly lady . Only thing is , he doesn't want to go away and soon start taking over the household and takes the command , especially when some of his ' friends ' show up as well , without giving much more away of it all . The story makes this movie a sort of an ' unpleasant ' one to watch . of course in a positive and effective way . It provides the movie with a constant certain tension and not knowing what will happen next . But lets not overpraise this movie too much , fore it's definitely not the best or most perfect movie within its genre . The story and directions it is heading in are at times a bit too simple for that and also the restrained settings prevent this from being a true genre classic . It's a good and original early movie within its genre and it deserves to be known better but not really a movie you must see before you die or anything . The movie is directed by John Sturges . The man best known for directing movies such as " The Magnificent Seven " , " The Great Escape " and " Gunfight at the O . K . Corral " . So he's not really a man that is widely known for his thriller making expertise and it sort of makes it a shame after watching this movie that he didn't made any more thrillers in his career , since he obviously had the right talent and skills for it . The movie features Ethel Barrymore in a rather late role of hers . She is best known for her roles in ' 30's and ' 40's movies , as is she known for being the sister of John and Lionel Barrymore . Sort of funny that she once more plays a character in this movie who is mostly sitting on a chair and lying in a bed , as she also used to do in many other previous roles of her . But she plays a good role in this movie , even though I just never have been the biggest fan of her . Maurice Evans also plays a good early typical thriller villain with a brain . It was also nice to see a still quite young Angela Lansbury in this movie . Never thought I would see Angela Lansbury and Ethel Barrymore in one and the same movie together ! It's a kind of a surreal image . Definitely a movie that deserves to be better known and seen by more !
Good Bond movie with a few minor problems .	Of all the Bonds that have been made , this one is probably the darkest . One of the things that I am missing is the humor . It misses the typical Roger Moore James Bond humor with as a result that the movie becomes a bit too serious . Sure it has some funny moment but it just misses the Roger Moore touch he added to the later Bond movies . But that's no wonder since this was Moore's first Bond , it looks like both actor and crew were still searching for the right character for Moore's Bond . Another minor problem is the story . There happens too much in a too short amount of time . They could have resolved this by making the movie just 10 minutes longer . But still it is a very solid Bond movie . It has some amazing character such as Baron Samedi and the legendary Sheriff J . W . Pepper that later returned in " The Man with the Golden Gun " . The villains are one of the very best from the Bond series even though Kananga is a bit underused . Jane Seymour plays a great and beautiful Bond girl but again also she is a bit underused . The atmosphere is pretty dark , mainly of course the scene's in Harlem . It's interesting but I still prefer the lighter Bond . The movie is full with famous Bond scene's with the speed boat chase as one of the best . It's funny , spectacular and tense in other words : Typical Bond . I also always enjoy the scene's between Bond and M and this movie is no exception . Their relationship and the certain tension towards each other is priceless and always good for some hard laughs . It's pure comedy that not all people will understand . The music by George Martin is different but it suits the movie and it's atmosphere really well ! The main title song by Paul and Linda McCartney is also very good and one of the very best Bond theme songs . Solid Bond that could have been excellent .
And from nuts to nuttier !	Definitely not the best silent Laurel & Hardy comedy short but like all Laurel & Hardy movies ; it's all very enjoyable to watch . The premise of the movie is simple ( like it should be in a Laurel & Hardy movie ) and relies on the mishaps of the two boys as inexperienced and of course very clumsy waiters , at a fancy dinner party and of course things go from nuts to nuttier , as the movie progresses . The movie does has its tiresome , usual stretched out comical moments but some original well placed and timed humor as well , that was later also ' reused ' in multiple other Laurel & Hardy movies . It doesn't make this movie one of the most hilarious ones but definitely one of the most defining and typical Laurel & Hardy comedy shorts . The movie is directed by Edgar Kennedy , who as an actor also starred along side with Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy together in multiple of their comedy films , before and after this movie . In this case the movie definitely would had been a better one had it been a ' talkie ' but alas , it doesn't mean that the overall end result is disappointing . This movie has plenty of entertaining slapstick humor to offer , that will surely shall please the fans .
William Shatner killing again !	17 years after his previous Columbo movie appearance , William Shatner again plays the murderer within a Columbo movie . His role is better and more interesting than was the case in his previous Columbo movie appearance but his performance isn't really though . Shatner goes terribly over-the-top with his role and he actually is a real B-actor , with an A-actor's status however , due to his " Star Trek " fame . It's actually quite fun to see him act but for all the wrong reasons , especially in the way he delivers his lines . Peter Falk on the other hand is really great , perhaps even better than usual . He seemed to be in a good mood while playing in this . He provides the movie with some great relieving humor . No big surprise that the movie features some good humor since the movie is directed by Dennis Dugan . Dugan is a director who mostly directed comedies throughout his career . He began his career with directing for TV but now days he also has some successful and well known theatrical movies behind his name , with " I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry " and " You Don't Mess with the Zohan " as the most recent examples . The movie has a real typical Columbo movie plot , that follows the usual formula and features all of the right requirements . So no surprises in this movie really or anything that makes this movie a special one but it's all good enough to please the average Columbo lovers . The killing is actually done quite good and original too bad that the rest of the movie its plot isn't that good or interesting . I love though how Lt . Columbo is trying to put pressure on the Shatner character by using his obvious love for his ( step ) daughter against him , later in the movie . So yes , despite Shatner this is still a fine average and certainly watchable Columbo movie entry .
Not the best example of WW II / action-movie making but it has some great moments .	The concept of the movie is both great and original but however the execution of it is not exactly done in the best way possible . The movie starts of very slow and even perhaps a bit boring . Thankfuly the second halve of the movie is much better once the action and story really start and take more pace and form . It might not be as entertaining and good as other WW II / action movies , meant as entertainment , such as " Where Eagles Dare " , " Kelly's Heroes " and " The Guns of Navarone " but it does have some great moments in it which still helps to make " The Eagle Has Landed " a bit of a must see for the fans of the genre . The story is just great and its interesting to see a movie for once from the perspective of the German side . For once the Germans are not portrayed as ruthless villains but as soldiers with valor and courage instead . The movie is perhaps a bit moralistic in the first halve of the movie ( basicly every German soldier shown in the movie openly hates Hitler and is against the deportation of Jews to the concentration camps . It feels too forced all ) but nevertheless the perspective the movie is told from is great and works good for the movie . It's too bad that the movie is told needlessly slow at times , while it could had been a great fast paced action-movie . The movie has a great cast but this is not really an actors movie , meaning that the movie wouldn't had been any better or worse with some other lesser known names in it . It was weird to hear Donald Sutherland talking in an Irish accent and Robert Duvall with a German one . Also Treat Williams in one of his first movie roles was horrible as the American soldier Capt . Clark . On the other hand , it was great to see Donald Pleasance as Heinrich Himmler . Other big names in this movie are Michael Caine , Anthony Quayle and Jean Marsh . The action sequences are good and definitely the best part of the movie . The movie is somewhat entertaining to watch and it does have some well placed humor at times but its not quite enough to truly uplift this movie to a level of greatness . This last movie from director John Sturges is a memorable but not perfect one .
Basically a fun 2 hours .	Basically this movie is a great , fun , quality way to spend 2 hours . The whole script and ' criminal plan ' in it is not as cleverly or solid constructed as in the first movie , so fans of the first , don't expect another " Ocean's Eleven " . The movie doesn't really have a clear main plot , since you as a viewer also don't know exactly how the plan is going to work out . It isn't really the sort of a movie with a clear beginning , middle and end . It's more the sort of movie with a story that just ' happens ' , in which events just happens as they come along . It also adds to the unpredictability of the movie , which is of course on the other hand a good thing . It's again a greatly directed movie , with some great and unique classy style of its own , that shall remind you the most of movie's from the old days . The movie is good looking and fast paced , which makes the 2 hours go by without really realizing it . It was great to see Al Pacino in a role such as this . He hadn't played a real villain for far too long ! In this movie he can basically let himself go , but without ever really doing so , in order to not totally outclass the rest of the cast , that are after all the real heart of the series and are what the movies are all about . All of the other ' eleven ' actors also appear in this movie again . It's obvious they still have just as much fun playing together as they did when they first started in 2001 . That is the foremost reason why it's not unthinkable that more sequels will follow in the future , which will most likely also be directed again by Steven Soderbergh , who also seems to get along with the cast just fine . It's the fun and the fun that the actors obviously had playing together in this movie . that makes " Ocean's Thirteen " also such a fun movie to watch . Especially George Clooney and Brad Pitt seem to have really found each other . No , nothing too impressive or memorable but as long as your expectations for it aren't too high and you're not expecting another " Ocean's Eleven " , you'll simply have a fine and fun time watching this and therefor this is a real recommendable movie .
A decent start of the series but also clearly one of the lesser Harry Potter movies .	No , I'm not a big Harry Potter fan and probably never will be but I can appreciate the qualities of the movies . Definitely for a children movie this movie is of course of very high class , with fabulous looking sets , a whole load of well known British actors and an highly experienced crew involved . The movie forms a nice first set up for the future series of Harry Potter movies . Still I'm glad the movies and its characters have matured a lot since this movie . Probably also has to do with the fact that this movie and the second were directed by Chris Columbus who is an experienced children movie director , while the other Harry Potter movies were directed by more ' serious ' directors . Yes , it makes this movie a good children's movie to watch but also sort of makes this movie look and feel more outdated than any of the other Harry Potter movies , which also goes at the expense of its re-watchable value . Nevertheless , " Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone " remains good quality - and fun film . It knows to create an entire new world of its own with lots of often strange characters in it . The movie is of course a set up and the first establishment of a long running series of movies . This means that the movie consists for a big part out of character introductions . Yes , this results in the fact that there are a bit too many characters in the movie , also since some of them don't even seem to serve a purpose at all for the story but this got resolved in the later movies , by simply leaving out some characters but by introducing many new ones as well . So its sort of problem solving with another problem . Also a bit of a shame that the movie is lacking a real central villain . Professor Snape is treated as a villain , even though we learn by the end of the movie that he's not such a bad guy after all . The real main villain if the movie is of course Voldemort but he gets mostly only mentioned by name and basically doesn't do an awful lot in the movie and only sort of shows up in the very end of the movie . Not the way to treat a villain in my opinion , even though its of course clear from this movie on that he is going to play a much bigger and more important role in the future Harry Potter movies . I however in a case like this feel that they should had putted in a new and different villain besides Voldemort , since this movie is definitely lacking a sense of danger , excitement and action , even though the movie never bores , despite its quite long running time ( for a children's movie anyway . ) . The movie its quality is also surely being uplifted by its presence of well known and respected actors , such as Richard Harris , Maggie Smith , Robbie Coltrane and Alan Rickman among many others . Each of them are giving fine performances but it are mostly Harris and Rickman that catch the eye with their performances . The child actors are also managing fine , although its definitely and luckily true that their acting improved throughout during the later movies . The movie is great looking and knows to create a magic new world , with its set , costumes and make-up . It's not hard to see that this was a costly movie to make . The special effects are also mostly fine , though not really during the game of quidditch , or any other ' flying ' sequence for that matter . The movie gets also greatly supported by the musical score from John Williams . Sort of a waste for the series that Williams only scored the music for the first 3 movies . A good and fun enough start of the series , though luckily the movies improved more over the years .
Entertaining enough to watch but no way this is a classic .	" The Thin Man " surely is a fun enough movie to watch but it sort of annoys me that there are way better same type of movies out there from the same period that are better than this movie but far less known and appreciated . Yes its a good entertaining movie but it's also a very simplistic one in many regards . Simplistic in the way it's made . It's has a very simple look and apparently it also only cost 2 weeks to shoot this movie , which unfortunately really showed on screen for me . It's also very simplistic with its story . Well these type of entertaining ' 30's comedies are never really about its story but in this case it works sort of distracting since the movie is a detective movie with a murder mystery in it , in which the story always sort of automatically gets pushed toward the foreground . The only thing that can still save these type of simplistic movies are good characters and actors portraying them . This movie really has that . What mostly makes this movie is its main character former detective Nick Charles , played by William Powell and his wife Nora , played by the popular silent movie star Myrna Loy . They are a real odd couple , who perhaps are more best friends than truly lovers . Or perhaps brother and sister would be a better description of it . They love to have fun together and poke fun at each other . It's the most charming aspect of " The Thin Man " and at the same time also what makes this movie still an entertaining one to watch . On its own this movie really isn't that comedy filled as you would expect . The movie is lacking some good laughs for a comedy , which just more makes this a fun murder-mystery , rather than a full-blood comedy . The movie is perfectly cast with William Powell and Myrna Loy . They are great but they are even better together in this movie . They share some good screen chemistry together . It's also the movie that sort of re-launched Myrna Loy's career . She was a big actress in the silent era but she was one of those actresses that didn't quite made the step between the silent - and sound movies . She got rediscovered in this movie again and continued to act till the early 80's . Also the other characters and actors are good but you can debate and wonder if there aren't one or two too many characters in the movie , which also makes the movie at times a bit too convincing and tiresome to watch , simply because you don't care - and can't really follow the story , also due to its simplicity it gets brought to the screen with . Really not bad , I just hope that any of its 5 ( ! ) sequels is still better and more entertaining .
Good , fun , cheerful movie .	This is a rather simple but nevertheless enjoyable musical movie from the MGM studios , with Judy Garland and Gene Kelly for the last time together on screen . The story is very simple and of course totally predictable from start till finish but than again , which movie in this genre isn't ? At what this movie tries to achieve it does not fail . The movie tries to bring some bright , cheery , joyful entertainment and those who will allow themselves will surely have a good time watching this movie . Despite the movie being fun and all , the movie could had been a much more better one . The movie has lots of missed opportunities , such as all the actors having to work on the farm . They could had put in some extra comedy elements in there to make the movie work better and more effective as a comedy . The movie now is still fairly enjoyable as a comedy but its comedy is mostly in its characters rather than in its situations . It also is unfortunate to say that Garland isn't really at her best in this movie . Her weight changes are way too obvious in this movie . In the one sequence she is clearly more fat than in the other and vice versa , which works distracting in basically every single sequence she is in . Also her acting is still very old fashioned for 1950 standards . All of her fellow actors in this movie are much more accustomed to the ' newer ' acting standards than Garland obviously was . Gene Kelly on the other hand is in his element and he shows some good dancing but to be frank his character isn't the best or most interesting one imaginable . Yet it are the characters who mostly carry this movie . It still works out all thanks to it's wonderful created atmosphere and quick pace directing from Charles Walters , who made many other genre movies and was a choreographer as well . The musical numbers , with the exception of one or two good ones , aren't much special to listen to but yet they're all made interesting by the well choreographed dances and timing of it all . There aren't more songs than needed in the movie which makes this movie also perfectly watchable for the non-fans of the genre , like myself . The movie has a good fun atmosphere and is good and cheerful looking with nice sets and costumes . It makes the movie charming to watch , like almost every MGM musical is . It's the sort of movie you watch to help to make you forget all your sorrows for a short while .
Amusing silly ' 80's comedy .	This is one of those typical silly early ' 80's comedies , that features lots of immature teenage type of lame humor and nudity and sex jokes . No , this by no means is a great movie and it also is hardly the best the genre has to offer but it's a movie that simply serves its purpose and brings some good entertainment . The movie features dozens of silly and over-the-top characters , who are the main reason why this movie is such a maintaining and silly entertaining one to watch . It features Tom Hanks in an early comical movie role and it actually is sort of a shame he doesn't do movies like this anymore , since he certainly was very talented at it . Not that I mind the movies that he does now days of course but it at the same time is also a waste of his comical talent . The movie also tries to feature some more serious elements , that concentrated on what it means to be married . Not that this works out horrible for the movie but it of course is also distracting a bit from what the movie is really truly about ; simple immature comedy . Further more there is very little story actually and it simply features on the events during and around a bachelor party . The movie is so silly , simplistic and immature that you just can't help being entertained by it all . No matter how bad and cheesy it all gets , you can't help laughing at this movie . Some comical moments are just plain great . A real enjoyable silly ' 80's comedy , starring a young Tom Hanks .
A good game that could and should had been a much better one .	It was already very hard for this game to live up to its hype . It's based on the classic and immensely popular , WW II first person shooter , " Wolfenstein 3D " , from 1992 . It's was already quite hard to live up to the success of its predecessor and with the Medal of Honor games already out on the market , it became even harder to make a both original and impressive enough game , to please the Wolfenstein fans as well as offering something new to the players of other WW II shoot such as the Medal of Honor games . Even though the game is not bad , it still is a disappointing one to both of these groups of gamers . The game has a solid story-line and both the story and atmosphere remain loyal to the classic " Wolfenstein 3D " . Even though the game-play is more like the Medal of Honor games , the atmosphere was really like " Wolfenstein 3D " , which gave the game a certain degree of originality and playability . The game at first begins as every other WW II shooter but as the story and the game progresses , the game becomes more and more dark , especially when the first occult elements are introduced into the game . The occult and monstrous elements of the game make sure that the movie is a really scary one to play at certain moments . Some the monsters really pop out of nowhere at times and the sound effects are what make those moments even more creepy . Some of the creatures in the game are very well constructed and also hard to beat . Especially the Uber Soldat , who is half human , half machine and is extremely hard to beat is one scary opponent . Normally characters like these are used as level end-bosses but in this game they pop up regularly , like any other monster . Just the sound of an huge Uber Soldat slowly approaching and just knowing that he's ready to fire a missile or his Venom-gun at you is reason enough to crap your pants . The game is filled with ' crapping-your-pants ' moments like these , also especially with the characters known as Lopers . I especially remember playing this game late at night , with the lights off and the sound turned up was a quite scary experience . But has the game more to offer than just original opponent and a good atmosphere ? Unfortunately not really . With the Medal of Honor games already out on the market at the time , this game falls flat as a WW II shooter . The game-play and levels are not as good and also the weaponry is lacking , with the excepting of a few ' futuristic ' weapons such as the mini-gun and Tesla gun and original weapons such as the flamethrower . The game just doesn't play as easy and familiar as other first person shootersSome of the levels are really great to play but as a whole the game doesn't really have a very high re playability value . I remember maybe finishing this games about three times and after that I was already fed-up and bored with the game and just went on playing the Medal of Honor games , of which I never grew tired ( still play those games occasionally ) . Most of the level end-bosses are good and hard to beat . So are most of the other normal characters in the game . The Nazi's have a good gaming intelligence and the monsters are scary and original enough to enjoy playing against . The game has some more original characters besides just monsters , such as elite troops and Nazi-women who are quite hard to beat in the game . Unfortunately the end boss is a disappointing one . Beating a guy who has just a sword , when you have a mini-gun , machine guns , rocket-launchers and other explosive isn't a very hard task . I had more trouble beating the other level end bosses than the final one . I even expected the game to continue and was really surprised that I had finished the game after I had beaten Heinrich I . It was really quite disappointing to be perfectly honest . Like many other Wolfenstein fans I had hoped to fight Hitler in a mechanical suit just like in " Wolfenstein 3D " . " Wolfenstein 3D " is still the best Wolfenstein game ever made , even despite the fact that this game has still more to offer the gamer .
The more interesting Za ginipiggu movie .	The Za ginipiggu aren't exactly very deep or original movies , since mostly they are purely about seeing people being tortured , dismembered and eventually getting killed but " Za ginipiggu 4 : Manhoru no naka no ningyo " has something extra to it , due to its bizarre but yet also intriguing story . The movie does actually has a plot and story to it . It's a weird one but a story nevertheless , that besides is actually quite intriguing because it's so unusual . It's about a lonely artist finding a mermaid in the sewer , whom he decides to take home with him when she falls ill to continue to paint her . Her condition however only worsens when she starts to develop sores all over her body . The Za ginipiggu-series is known for its gore and its attempts to shock with it and I feel that this movie is so far ( still have to watch the other sequels ) being the most successful with it . Even though it doesn't feature any torture sequences or other graphic moments like the previous movies featured , it still is the movie that grossed me out the most . It's a truly disgusting movie to watch . Graphically it's a good looking movie with all of its effects . Still the production values are being obviously fairly low and also the actors far from impress . Don't miss out this movie once you get into the unusual Za ginipiggu-series .
Well made movie that yet is lacking in the right emotions and depth to make this a really great one .	Movies that are based on true events are also interesting to watch , since no matter how unlikely or hard to believe everything in it is , it's still realistic since it truly happened . It makes the story as well as the movie as a whole a compelling and intriguing one . The movie is from a technical point of view a real great one . The movie is well directed and good looking , with some good cinematography . The acting also really helps this movie . The two main character are being played well by Ian Hart and Linus Roache , who basically for the obvious reasons have to carry the entire movie on their own . No way the movie would had worked out well with some lesser actors . But the movie is too flawed to yet consider this a completely successful - or a must-see movie . Problem is the time-line of the movie . Keenan and McCarthy were being held captive for 4 and a halve years but the way the story is told in this movie , makes it seem rather like 2 months , at most . Things in this movie also happen too rapidly . They are being dragged from the one location to the other and get into some events that are already over before you can really start thinking about it . The movie doesn't leave the viewer enough room to think and process some of the moments . This is obviously also due to the short running time of the movie . But on the other hand it would of course be also impossible and perhaps even boring to make a 2 hour long movie about two guys who are being held captive together in a small room . So I can still understand some of the choices the filmmakers made with this movie when it comes to the storytelling and story flow . They did the best they could with the concept , without ever making the movie less interesting . But I wish I could say that this was the only problem of the movie . The movie is also severely lacking in the right emotions and required depth . The movie doesn't ever really become personal with the two main characters and they hardly at all speak about home or their family . The movie could had been so much more powerful and emotional if it only had some better emotions and depth in it . The movie still works well on a dramatic level but not on the right level , a movie like this requires . All of this however doesn't mean that the movie is any less interesting to watch . The movie always remains interesting throughout its running time , also due to the fact that you never know what is going to happen next . They are in a unpredictable situation and the movie does a good job at captivating this atmosphere of strange fear , companionship and hope . The movie tells the story entirely from the point of view of the two hostages , which doesn't provide the movie with any unnecessary sequences or subplots . The movie is simple , straight-forward and exactly how a movie with a story like this should be . The movie does feature some interesting sequences between the two hostages but also with their captivators . It gives the movie a certain extra sense of reality and helps to set up the right mood for the movie . But yet for some reason I feel that the film-makers tried a bit too hard to be political correct and to not offend any group . It doesn't exactly makes this movie the most daring or confronting movie around . Perhaps not the must-see people make you believe it is but nevertheless a very well made movie that is definitely worth seeing .
It never gets too sappy or overdone .	This drama was a surprising good one . The story might sound over-dramatic and sappy but the execution of it all is surprising good . The director chooses an approach with lots of humor present . It makes " Marvin's Room " a well balanced drama that despite its heavy subject never feels overdone - or gets too heavy to watch . It's sort of too bad that this movie is always sort of regarded to as a Leonardo DiCaprio-flick . Its a movie from the period when he wasn't a well known male Hollywood lead yet . The mainstream audience had yet to discover him , which they did a year later with " Titanic " , while certain smaller groups of movie viewers already discovered this great young talent in movies such as " What's Eating Gilbert Grape " , " The Quick and the Dead " and " Romeo + Juliet " . This movie however deserves so much more than just being regarded as as a Leonardo DiCaprio-flick . I'm sure of the fact that this movie is regarded as such , scares lots of people of from watching this movie ( mainly " Titanic " haters ) . Yes , Leonardo DiCaprio is in the movie but no he doesn't play the main lead , or a pretty boy , which he more often did in his later movies , which are the reason why he also has so many haters all over the world . So really , if you're not a fan of DiCaprio's later movies ( after 1997 ) you'll most likely still enjoy this movie . So please , just give this movie a chance , it's certainly worth it . I was not sure what to expect from this movie . The story sounded over-dramatic . It's the sort of story were one problem is not enough . Basically every characters has several problems and issues . A movie like this can easily go over-the-top or it can get too sappy and overdone . I'm glad to say that the movie however surprised me and surpassed my expectations . Because of the fact that the movie is told with quite some humor , it doesn't make the movie an heavy one . Sure , there are plenty of dramatic scene's still present in the movie but it all is extremely well balanced all . It never gets too heavy but it also never gets too humorous either . It makes both the drama and the humor work out really well in the movie . It also certainly helps the movie that there are lots of stars present in it . They make the characters and events feel more likely and realistic . Meryl Streep is perhaps one of the best actresses of all time , although this role is certainly not her best one but I think that says more about Streep herself rather than her performance in this movie . Of course Diane Keaton is no light-weight either . She delivers a powerful performance . Also Leonardo DiCaprio shows that he is more than just a pretty face . A smaller role is there for Robert De Niro . It's the sort of role basically everyone could play and it doesn't make a very big or lasting impression , so don't expect much of him when watching this movie . The only reason why he plays a small role in this movie is because he also was one of the producers for this movie . But if you take away all those great actors , would this still had been such a good movie to watch ? I don't think so . At certain moments while watching this movie I even wondered why all those famous actors ever agreed to be in this movie . I think that the movie had some great casting persons and some powerful , influential producers . It probably also had to do with the director Jerry Zaks who was a very successful award winning Broadway director prior to this movie . ( Perhaps he also had already worked with some of the stars out of this movie ? ) But really , the story on its own is not good or powerful enough to carry the entire movie or make it an incredible interesting or emotional powerful one . So on its own , the movie is a pretty empty and formulaic one but it is made interesting , good and powerful thanks to the wonderful cast and refreshing directing and approach by Jerry Zaks . Of course this movie is mainly for the lovers of drama movies but everyone should be able to appreciate and enjoy this movie thanks to its approach of the heavy themes and the professional cast playing the characters .
Such a pleasant western !	This is a rather little entertaining western to watch . It has all of the violence and shooting but still it's made in a sort of more light and fun way . Never thought I would ever see Leonard Nimoy in a western . He made some appearance in western's but mostly in series and TV-movies . I think this is his biggest western's role out of his career . On top of that , he also plays the villain in this one and he does it extremely well . He truly had some real talent for playing the bad guy and I wouldn't had minded seeing him in more roles such as this one . Yul Brynner is also good as always . He really was in his element in westerns . In this movie he takes a more of a kind and humorous approach , which also works out really well for him . The characters are good ones but the character treatment isn't among the greatest . Yul Brynner will disappear out of the movie for some time , then Richard Crenna and then Leonard Nimoy . He's supposed to be the main villain , but nevertheless he gets hardly featured in the second halve of the movie at all . Consistency is not a too common thing within this movie . It's fine that the movie concentrates mainly on two characters , that are different and also on the other side of the law , but still great friends , although they are not afraid to punch , or shoot at each other either to get what they want . This sort of approach of an unlikely friendship isn't of course uncommon in a western . The story is a fine one , that leaves plenty of room for action . There a lot of shootouts , also involving villainous Indians . It all makes sure that the movie at all time is a fast going , with plenty happening on the screen . It's a real ' 70's western . ' 70's westerns are a total different thing from westerns from any other decade . It has that typical kind of ' 70's rawness all over it and in this case the movie also features some experimental techniques , such as some extremely fast editing in some scenes . Not sure if it truly helps or uplifts the movie but it still makes it a tiny bit more interesting to watch . Really a movie I enjoyed watching , though it's obviously no genre classic . It's just too small and insignificant for that .
Good early Columbo murder mystery .	The Columbo movies are all great murder mysteries to watch . Difference with most other serials / movies is that in a Columbo movie you always get to see the killing right in the beginning , which also means that you already know who is the killer . So all the Columbo movies show is how Lieutenant Columbo solves the crime , in his own unique way . This is an approach that always works surprising well and the movie also still leaves plenty of surprises , since you never know exactly how the killer came to its deed and what the motive was . The movie gets of course carried by Peter Falk as the strange and quirky but of course clever and very observing Lieutenant Columbo . Though I liked the ' old man ' Columbo better in the later TV movies . He pretends to be more stupid than he in fact of course truly is , in order to harmlessly gain trust from his suspects . It's a great character and basically the foremost reason why this Columbo TV movies are so popular and still great to watch after all those years . The Columbo movies were made in even 5 different decades , all with Peter Falk in the title role , which says something of its popularity and quality of the series , that just never seems to dry out . The series will probably won't ever stop until Peter Falk is no more . Acedemy Award winner and multiple nominee Lee Grant also plays a good role but most of the other actors in this movie seem like C-grade TV series actors . Especially Patricia Mattick was annoyingly bad and all her character ever did was moaning . This movie is the second of two Columbo pilots . Strangely enough it was made 3 years after the first Columbo pilot " Prescription : Murder " , as if the first pilot was not a total success but they still wanted to give it a chance , having faith in its potential . It has a good story that drags a bit at points and the clues left out for Lieutenant Columbo are at times a bit too obvious but knows to keep your interest throughout . It has some interesting side-plots and developments but it doesn't ever allow things to fully develop in order to make it all fit into the time span of the movie . This also means on the other hand that the movie feels like it wrapped up too fast toward the ending . The movie features some quirky ' 70's effects and trick but luckily enough it never really crosses the line . It's also a reason why this movie surely doesn't feel outdated and is actually now just still as good as ever to watch .
Columbo and the art world .	This is a great and enjoyable Columbo movie entry in the long running series of Columbo movies . It's slightly even better than the average Columbo movies . I liked the movie its style . Director Hy Averback ( Hy ? ) did a great job with it ! You can really tell by its that this is a ' 70's movie . Having a typical ' 70's atmosphere has never harmed a movie , so that's a real positive thing . Because the movie its story is set in the world of art , the movie features a whole bunch of quirky characters , which of course makes the movie also really pleasant to watch . This time the only quirkiness doesn't come from the Columbo character alone . Actually the story is not that much special in its core and the killing itself and the whole plan around it also isn't among the best or most ingenious ones but the movie is greatly paced and due to its style and plenty of humor this movie is great watch . Despite the fact that the movie doesn't really feature any big names in it , besides Peter Falk himself . it really doesn't hurt the movie , since the actors portraying the main characters in this movie are obvious capable ones . Ross Martin plays a great role as the movie its murderer . It's quite a good character as well . A great match for Lieutenant Columbo . Yet another greatly watchable Columbo TV-movie .
European movie-making Hollywood-style .	I think that this movie is more in European movie-making style than most of its other Hollywood movies from the same genre . It has a different way of storytelling , different more straight-forward characters and dialogs and of course sex and nudity . I think that director John Dahl feels more at ease with directing movies more in an European kind of style than in the typical Hollywood-style . It's maybe also the reason why none of his movies ever became a commercial success , though his movies definitely have quality . Nevertheless , for a genre movie this movie was just lacking too much to consider it a completely successful one . For too long the story just moves on and happens without a clear indication at what the direction the movie is heading to . Maybe I was just expecting the movie to be more fun . The movie is now more of a serious crime / thriller with some slight comical undertones , that are mostly notable in some of its characters . But nevertheless , I feel that it's a big miss that they didn't made the movie any more fun by for instance adding some more plot lines , with different characters , all trying to hunt down Bridget Gregory / Wendy Kroy , for whatever reason . Now instead there isn't always enough happening and developing in the movie . It doesn't make the movie the most tense , exciting or even most original one out of its genre . The story on its own is quite good and interesting , in which a manipulative , beautiful , intelligent woman is trying to trick a man in killing her husband , of whom she has stolen close to a million dollar of him . It's interesting to see the manipulative and intelligent woman at work , by throwing in her looks and sexual-abilities , to get what she wants . It's a real femme fatale . It really helps the movie that it has such as fine , strong , leading femme fatale , played by Linda Fiorentino , who definitely fits the role . It's not necessarily her acting but its more her character that makes the movie work out . It's sort of suiting for the ' 90's , when lots of strong female character-roles arose . The other roles in this movie are limited down too much to my regret . Bill Pullman is good in this movie but he basically is only in the beginning and end of the movie . J . T . Walsh gets also extremely underused in a way too small role , that seemed like a fun one with more potential to it . This movie also seriously made me think about something . The movie made me realize that the ' 90's just wasn't the decade for movies , when it comes down to style . I'm talking about visual style but also definitely about the costumes and hair . It's all pretty bleach and style-less , especially the early ' 90's , if you compare it to any other random decade of movie-making . But oh well , who knows . maybe in 50 years from now people shall praise this movie for having a typical great ' 90's style ! Good enough movie but just not the must-see I heard it was .
A fun adventurous movie !	To me this movie was a nice little surprise , I enjoyed it a lot more than I expected . The movie is fun and adventurous and surpassed my expectations on several fronts . The movie is cleverly written by Gerard Soeteman who manages to put in some good jokes and funny witty dialog . Soeteman also was responsible for writing all of Paul Verhoeven's Dutch movies and the TV-series " Floris " starring Rutger Hauer on which this movie is based . Of course this movie is nothing like the black & white TV-series from the late ' 60's that launched the career for both actor Rutger Hauer and director Paul Verhoeven but than again , this movie doesn't pretend to be like the TV-series . The movie is set in a different time-period and even though all of the characters are meant to be granddaughters and grandsons of the original characters from the TV-series , this movie and its characters feel good and original on its own . It's like all the characters had gotten a modern refreshing remake . The villains are deliciously stereotypical evil , dumb and just totally over-the-top . Yes , the movie does also feature a love-story but in this case it is totally not distracting at any moment and is handled nicely . This movie has Dutch written all over it . I mean when persons are fighting in a mill while they are throwing cheeses at each other , you know you're watching a movie set in The Netherlands . Also of course weed is a thing not to be missed in a Dutch movie , this one included . Most of the jokes are ' inside jokes ' that I'm sure only Dutch adults will notice and appreciate but I seriously laughed out loud at some moments . I think an international audience will not appreciate this movie as much as Dutch people will . The story is simple so that also the young ones will be able to follow and appreciate this fun adventurous movie . The fights and sword fights might be a bit of a disappointing thing of the movie but all the fun characters and the cleverly written jokes compensate for this and make you forget the weak story and the just totally ridicules moments . I enjoyed this movie from start to finish and was pleasantly surprised by it all . Another thing that surely surpassed my expectations was the acting . Especially Michiel Huisman , Victor Löw and Daan Schuurmans were truly excellent ! I truly enjoyed their performances in this movie . It's quite unique for me to say that I enjoyed persons acting performances in a Dutch movie , so I think that says a lot about this movie ! Even though it is notable that this movie hasn't got a major budget , the movie stills manages to create a little epic feeling , due to the nice and beautiful settings . It gives the movie a wonderful adventurous feeling and atmosphere . ( especially towards the Dutch people here ) You should give this movie a chance ! It really surprised me how incredible lighthearted fun this movie was . Fun adventurous entertainment from start till finish !
Amusing Laurel & Hardy silent short .	Although I certainly don't consider this movie to be Laurel & Hardy's best , it still is of course a very amusing short , that features plenty of good slapstick moments . The movie is a bit dragging at times with its gags but overall the movie has plenty of moments in that will surely make you laugh . Especially the ending is purely classic . The slapstick comedy is very typically Laurel & Hardy like , so fans of the two will surely enjoy watching this comedy short . Like often was the case with Laurel & Hardy , the movie can be divided into two parts . The first halve is about the comedy duo playing in a municipal band , while the second halve is about the two coping with the fact that they are fired from the band by trying to earn some money on the street by playing . Both parts have their up - and downsides but overall the upsides overcome its lesser parts . The movie got directed by Edgar Kennedy , who also directed the other Laurel & Hardy silent short " From Soup To Nuts " . Kennedy is still best known though as an actor playing in several Laurel & Hardy movies , most often as the cop Kennedy . Amusing , especially for the fans .
Professionaly made movie that is good looking and well made but not as fun as hoped and expected .	This is yet another long Laurel & Hardy movie which uses a classic and well known story as the basis for the movie . This time its the libretto ; Fra Diavolo , set in the early 18th century Italy . Problem with these sort of Laurel & Hardy pictures always is that the story distracts from their antics . It causes the movie to be a bit too often too serious and leaves too little room for Laurel & Hardy's great comical talent and timing . Most of the time the different characters in this movie fulfill the roles of the main characters and Laurel & Hardy turn in into merely comical sidekicks who provide the comical relief . But it definitely is true that this movie is a well made one . It's directed by Hal Roach himself and has some fine looking sets and costumes . It distinct this movie from most other Laurel & Hardy pictures from the same period . It provides the movie with some good looking sequences . The story is nicely told although but at certain points it starts to drag a little . Nevertheless the movie remains for most part a perfectly entertaining one to watch . There still also are plenty of enough comical great sequences by the two boys , who provide the movie with some memorable and enjoyable moments throughout the movie . The movie further more features Laurel & Hardy regulars Thelma Todd and James Finlayson , in big roles , who also add to the entertainment value and comical level of this movie . This definitely isn't the most pleasant or must fun Laurel & Hardy movie around to watch but this movie still offers plenty of enough reasons why this movie still is a perfectly good and entertaining one to watch .
Laurel & Hardy in their last silent movie .	No this is not an Ed Wood movie . " Angora Love " is Stan Laurel's and Oliver Hardy's last silent movie . The end of an era ! In the ' 20's Laurel & Hardy left a real mark on the silent movie genre with movies that are still popular and being watched and aired regularly , this present day . It's a shame that this movie is however not among their best . The premise of the movie sounds good and is good . The boys team up with a goat this time , which of course leads them into trouble and for us some hilarious situations to watch . It however at the same time is extremely silly and just totally unbelievable to watch the boys doing comedy stuff with a goat . Most of the jokes in the movie still work good but the movie just however never gets truly hilarious or memorable . The comedy and story really feels lacking at times and is mostly too simple and predictable . Of course still good and fun enough to watch for the fans but still a slightly disappointing last silent Laurel & Hardy entry .
Great and interesting WW II propaganda movie .	This American WW II time propaganda movie tells about the invention of the jeep and the everyday use of it by the American army during WW II . The end result is an interesting to watch short film , that also works quite well educational . Not trying to sound like a big history buff but I know quite a lot about WW II and its weapons and vehicles of its time . Nevertheless , it wasn't until this film that I really fully started to realize - and appreciate the importance of the jeep and what a quite revolutionary invention it was , for its time . Let's face it , without WW II the jeep would had probably not had been invented for another 10 or 15 years . War always brings new inventions , that are revolutionary and in many ways ahead of its time . The jeep is really one of those revolutionary war-time inventions . This short film shows the jeep in full action and shows for what purposes it all can be used by the army . I still learned some things I didn't knew yet . It all is told and explained from the point of view of the jeep itself . It might sound childish perhaps but it works really well . Instead of having a 30 minutes + long documentary with lots of talking , this is a fast paced only 9 minutes short documentary that tells you everything you really want to know and it does this in a rather light and amusing way , without ever loosing any of its informing and educational value . The short running time and its pace also makes sure that it keeps you interested for its entire duration . The film also features a whole lot of military , royal and Hollywood celebrities driving the jeep , to once more - and to extra point out the importance , reliability and usefulness of the vehicle . Great light educational , little short , WW II-time film .
Errol Flynn embarks on his first Swashbuckling Hollywood adventure .	What a great American main lead debut this movie was for Errol Flynn . This movie set the standards for many swashbuckling movies to follow , of which most also starred Errol Flynn in the main lead . In that regard this movie is already a classic and historical important movie . What makes the movie even more interesting is the fact that this is the first movie that stars Olivia de Havilland as Flynn's love interest and this is also the first movie in which Flynn crosses his sword with Basil Rathbone . The three of them would later appear in many more swashbuckler movies , most also directed by Michael Curtiz . What this movie does very well is telling its story . There are really quite a lot of characters and events in this movie but ever character and event is relevant and well developed and brought to the screen . Especially the characters are what makes this movie such a great and special one . Some of the characters are not introduced halve way through the movie , such as the Basil Rathbone but still yet they manage to develop the characters well and let them play an important and relevant part in the movie , as if they have been in it the whole time . But also the story is very good . It's adventurous , has a love-story in it and features some spectacular action sequences . What more could you wish from a swashbuckler ? A swashbuckling Erich Wolfgang Korngold musical score maybe ? Well guess what . . . that is present as well ! There are certainly parallels between this movie and the now other popular ' Pirates of the Caribbean ' pirate movies . Both stories are set in Port Royal , the lesser of stand main character falls in love with a lady of stand and both stories feature the pirate town of Tortuga in it . There are countless more and less notable parallels between both movies . It's nice and interesting to see how new pirate movies can still be linked to an movie made over 70 years ago . It's an indication how bar raising and important this picture has been to later genre movies . Of course by todays standards the story , the characters and events seem terribly outdated and ' friendly ' . Like in every swashbuckler has always been the case ; the good guys are extremely good and the bad guys are extremely bad . It's as simple as that . You can perhaps call it simple or naive . Even when they choose the pirate life , the characters still remain perfectly well mannered men with rules to share everything and not to harm or capture any woman . It's perhaps a reason why not just everybody will be able to enjoy or like to watch this movie . Myabe you have to be a bit familiar with the genre and the time period of movie making to follow enjoy and appreciate this movie for what it is . Granted that the story is not perfect . For instance it remains a vague mystery to my why every man follows Peter Blood , who didn't had any fighting experience and didn't fought during the rebellion like his fellow country men and fellow sentenced slaves . Without question they make them their captain and follow his rules . And how exactly did Captain Blood became such a legendary pirate , while all he did was being an honest and friendly , instead of feared and powerful . All things that are simple not explained in the movie . Yet Errol Flynn's charismatic performance helps you to forget all these story problems and just makes you simply enjoy this movie . It's really thanks to Flynn's charismatic , witty , athletic , gentleman like performance that makes his character , as well as the story work out . Also his good and heroic looks certainly helps him being convincing in his role but it also really is his acting that is more than great . His style of acting seemed to be ahead of its time . Also the chemistry between him and Olivia de Havilland is already notable in this first movie of them together . It also certainly helps the movie . I mostly knew Lionel Atwill from countless Frankenstein movies from the ' 30's and ' 40's , so it was refreshing to see him a cruel ruthless villainous role for a change , which suited him well . He delivers a fine and at times also comical performance . Basil Rathbone's role is perhaps not as big as you would expect but his presence is impressive and memorable enough . The movie is really impressive and big looking . The sets and costumes are all very realistic looking as well as the miniature battle sequences , that are obvious fake but at the same time highly convincing and impressive looking . Most of the action sequences in the movie look fake , especially of course by todays standards but in ' 30's perspective they are extremely spectacular and well filmed and edited into the movie . The cinematography by multiple Oscar winners and nominees Ernest Haller and Hal Mohr as a times also truly excellent and they provide the movie with some really ' experimental ' and beautiful shot sequences . The movie also uses some early ' montage ' sequences which was I think unique for its period ( ? ) and it works highly effective as well for the movie and its story flow . This movie could had easily turned into a three hour lasting mammoth production but it now instead is an highly entertaining and spectacular 2 hour production that is an adventure to watch . Not the greatest Flynn swashbuckler but a darn fine first one for him , that set the standards for later genre movies .
A feast for eyes and ears but flawed in its emotions .	" The Mission " is without doubt a beautiful movie . The visual are absolutely stunning . Most credit for that has to go to Mother Nature . The music by Ennio Morricone is a real threat , it might very well be his best work till date in my opinion . However the movie is more style than substance . The movie is lacking the emotions it needed and the storytelling misses the point at times . I wish more movies were made about the European slave trade . Movies have become an important medium of history telling over the last couple of years . These kind of stories are important and because of that more movies about it should be made . I however feel that this particular movie misses the point at times . The movie should be about the natives and their struggle against the Portugues slave traders and how they want to contain their way of live and habitat . The movie however focuses at times a bit too much on the Jesuits instead . The movie could had really been an emotionally powerful one if we the viewers actually got to care more about the natives . The movie tries to be emotional but fails because the story is brought wrongly . Robert De Niro is really great in his role even though he doesn't get that much to do in this movie . It's a bit of a waste of a great actor . Main character of the movie is played by Jeremy Irons who also does more than great . Some smaller part are played by Liam Neeson and Aidan Quinn . To be honest I wouldn't call Quinn's appearance anything more than just a cameo . I have some mixed feelings about this movie . The first - and middle part of the movie were really good and powerful however in the last 30 minutes of the movie the story concentrates on how the natives with the help of some of the Jesuits fight back against the Portogues . The first and middle halve of the movie mainly concentrated on how peaceful and beautiful the world of the natives was , it was ' On Earth As It Is In Heaven ' , so when the natives suddenly decide to pick up their weapons and go to battle , suddenly all of the respect and emotional bond that was build up in the first - and middle part of the movie is gone . Another example of how the storytelling of the movie is flawed . If the story was brought in a better way I would perhaps had been more shocked and saddened by the fact that the natives got slaughters along with the Jesuits . Don't get me wrong I liked the ending but it just didn't blend in very well with the rest of the movie . Still I rate this movie highly for the following reason . I judge this movie as a movie not as a history lesson , which it really could had been . As a movie it is good , despite its at times flawed storytelling . The visuals are really what makes " The Mission " an unforgettable and highly recommendable movie . The movie might not be as powerful but it's still interesting to watch .
Finally after 40 years receiving the recognition it deserves .	Before 2002 this movie was very rarely shown . Producer Alfred Heineken ( better known as Freddie Heineken , yes indeed THE big man behind the famous Dutch beer brewery ) had forbidden all public showings of this movie , with the exception of a few cinematic showings and one appearance on Dutch television . Reason for this was that his mistress Nan Los played in the film . So in a way this movie has always been hidden for the public till the death of Heineken in 2002 , a shame because it's a pretty good war drama ! The first halve of the movie is very standard stuff . Typical WW II Dutch drama stuff you can say . The second halve however was very good ! The story became tense and even mysterious and had a few surprising twists and a very excellent ending ! Lex Schoorel is a very irritating leading man as Ducker however as Dorbeck , who is also played by him , he is strangely enough very good . It's no coincidence that after this he appeared rarely in any other notable movies , with the exception of the television show " Floris " directed by Paul Verhoeven and staring Rutger Hauer and the failed but well known movie " Grijpstra & De Gier " also with Rutger Hauer and Rijk de Gooyer . The rest of the cast consist mainly out of fairly unknown actors with the exception of Sacco van der Made and Piet Römer who received most of their fame in the 90's . All of the acting performances reminded me of those from Hollywood movies made in the 40's and 50's . The movie besides looks even more outdated because it's in black & white . The editing is at times very weird and the sound is also pretty messed up at times . This movie is certainly not as good as Fons Rademakers other Dutch war drama , the Academy Award winning movie " De Aanslag " with Derek de Lint and most definitely not as good as Paul Verhoeven's masterpiece " Soldaat van Oranje " . But the second halve and certainly the ending make this movie a very solid war drama with an excellent story . Worth seeing if you get the chance .
This movie hits hard !	What a totally ridicules and stupid movie this was . . . I LOVE IT ! This movie is like the biggest load of nonsense you'll ever see . I mean an entire movie focused on the game dodgeball ? What movie has a more ridicules concept than that ? Fans of silly humor , this is a must see for you ! The movie has several strong aspects . One and maybe the biggest are the characters . They are all extremely stereotyped and over-the-top but my goss I love them . Ben Stiller is especially hilarious as the ' villain ' with his crazy hair and silly outfits . The dodgeball games are definitely the highlights of the movie . I don't really care much about what happens in the movie outside of the dodgeball games to be frank . Nothing beats seeing some silly characters like members of team kamikaze and team blitzkrieg , who are coached by David Hasselhoff , being hit hard in the face or a more sensitive body location , by some balls . The humor is totally wrong but you can't help loving it . The movie is filled with some truly hilarious moments and some well written dialog . If you enjoy silly humor , this is simply a must see !
Surprising good movie , part of the Hammer films Frankenstein franchise .	This movie truly surpassed my expectations . It's the fifth of the Hammer Frankenstein films and was followed by two more Frankenstein movies . Even though there aren't an awful lot of original elements in the movie , it still is better than the average Hammer movie . No , the story certainly isn't the strongest element of this movie . It's all very average and typical stuff like you would expect in a Frankenstein movie and it all is quite silly . Still , legendary horror director Terence Fisher knows how to make the story interesting . There are some very well constructed sequences in the movie that actually succeed in becoming tense at times , such as when the police search the house for Dr . Brandt . The tension is build up well and the scene as a whole works very successful . But it of course is also the acting that carries this movie . Peter Cushing once again plays Baron Frankenstein . Cushing gives one of the better performances out of his Hammer movie career and is truly excellent in his role . In this movie Baron Frankenstein is an even more sadistic person . He also cold-heartedly kills and even rapes in this movie . Truly one of the most sinister performances of the Baron Frankenstein character . Some comic relief comes from the character played by Thorley Walters . He plays a typical comical Terence Fisher character , which are often portrayed in his movies , such as in " The Phantom of the Opera " ( 1962 ) . Also surprising good was the musical score by Oscar winner James Bernard , who scored lots of Hammer movies . It's funny that he won his only Oscar for his only written movie , " Seven Days to Noon " from 1950 . Standard Hammer horror story but an excellent execution of it all , by both cast and crew . For the Hammer movie fans , a definite must see .
Nice subject .	This movie short can go down in history as the first ever Edison production to be filmed outdoors . It picked an interesting and nice subject of having a rope and slack wire walker doing a couple of tricks outdoors . The rope and slack wire walker is Juan A . Caicedo . A Venezuelan who performed a couple of times in the United States , also in 1894 , when this film got shot . He really shows that he was not just any ordinary rope and slack wire walker and he does lots of jumping and bouncing within this movie , without of course falling off , or every loosing his balance . He is not on an incredible height but the things he does do look pretty dangerous nonetheless . I for one certainly wouldn't want to attempt trying all that he does within this movie short . No wonder he got called the ' king of the wire ' . It seems pretty amazing to me that he actually managed to stay within the camera it's field . A real achieved once you see what kind of tricks he does . Sort of makes you wonder how many takes it took them to finally get the right and wanted result . You can also conclude from this that this movie was well staged and set up by its director , whoever that was . Most likely it was just William Heise , the camera operator who also performed the directing duties that this movie short required . A nice to watch kinetographic experiment .
Can't believe how much I enjoyed watching this .	This is some delicious trash . It's a typical soft-core lesbian flick that gets combined with a well known horror story and characters . Well , not that this movie has much to do with the Bram Stoker novel of course , as a matter of fact this movie doesn't follow much story at all but the movie is really being saved and made by its sense of entertainment . The cast & crew obviously didn't took the project very seriously and I'm glad they didn't . The movie is deliberately over-the-top with its performances , story and comedy . This is what makes " Sexy Adventures of Van Helsing " a very fun movie to watch . I'll bet they had lots of fun making this movie . The movie of course has some very poor production values . This movies are purely made by the studios to cash in , they are interested in making a " Citizen Kane " like movie at all . This means that the story has an obvious cheap look , though I must admit that I had seen far worse for these type of movies . This movie actually did spend still some time on its make-up effects and all . It's comedy is almost cartoon like and no matter how cheesy it all often is , you'll still be entertained by it . As for the sex itself , after all this is an adult picture , it's pretty much what you could expect from a soft-core porn flick . So a lot is being implied but very little is being shown actually . Also the sex sequences also seem to come and go pretty random at times within the movie . As if the had to made a quota of a certain minimum amount of sex sequences . Because of this the movie doesn't really feel like it's following an actual story at all . Within its genre it's simple a very fine and entertaining movie .
Laurel and Hardy's mishaps with Charlie Hall .	This is a great constantly fun and hilarious comedy short from Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy . The movie gets even more hilarious from the point when Charlie Hall and his wife , played by Mae Busch , appear in the story . Laurel & Hardy get seriously drunk with Mrs . Hall , which result in an hilarious tit-for-tat routine with Mr . Hall and the boys . Tit-for-tat routines are often my personal favorite - and most hilarious things in any Laurel & Hardy movie . Normally Charlie Hall isn't exactly the greatest actor but in this movie he perhaps plays his very best role in a Laurel & Hardy comedy . Also Mae Busch is in top-form . The movie is filled with some well written and in the movie well timed and executed comical moments . Of course everything is extremely silly and unlikely but all the more hilarious because of that . A great Laurel & Hardy comedy short , that is well written and even better executed .
Quality fun .	To be honest , I didn't expect this movie to be as good as it turned out to be . No way this movie seemed like one deserving its current rating on here . This seemed to me like just another fluffy ' light'-Lord of the Rings children movie . But even though this movie borrows heavily from other movies , it remains a good and certainly fun quality production . Best choice the movie made , was that it was one that didn't took itself as seriously . You obviously have to take this movie with a grain of salt . It knows it is ridicules in parts and it doesn't try to hide this but rather even exploit it further . This is mostly what makes the movie so fun to watch . Because of this you also tend to forgive this movie from ' borrowing ' elements or entire sequences from other movies . Fact that his movie doesn't take itself as serious can also be seen in the delicious over-the-top roles from Robert De Niro and Michelle Pfeiffer roles . Because the movie needs to be taken with a grain of salt , also the humor works out the best . The humor within this movie feels non-forced , even though it got put in - and planned out all deliberately into the movie . It knows to remain fresh and it doesn't overly try to make you laugh . It's often more subtle and not something you would expect from a genre movie such as this . It's mostly the fun level and atmosphere of this movie that makes it such a good one to watch . Because lets be fair , if this movie purely had to rely on its story , this would had been a rather weak and simple movie to watch . It's quite formulaic stuff all and of course the way the story progresses is rather predictable . I also don't know if this is really a kids movie . Even though the movie got obviously targeted towards this audience , I strongly feel that it are the adults who will mostly enjoy watching this . The humor and overall story is too mature for that . Also the diverse wide range of characters makes this movie a real fun one to watch . Most characters are really over-the-top and are often being played by some fine big name actors . Besides the earlier mentioned Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert De Niro , the movie also features Sienna Miller , Ian McKellen , Peter O'Toole , Mark Strong , Rupert Everett , Claire Danes , Nathaniel Parker , Dexter Fletcher and Ricky Gervais among others . Most of them are well known respected British actors , which also already gives the movie a certain atmosphere . But it needs to be said , with all the many different characters in the movie it at times feels that most actors looked as if they were making a movie on their own . The movie doesn't always feel like a coherent one . Also the pacing isn't always right and the movie gave the feeling that it also could had been easily 15 minutes shorter . It on the other hand is a fine looking and constructed movie , even though it doesn't feature the best special effects around but this sort of feels suiting for the movie and its entire atmosphere . Highly recommendable and in this case believe the hype !
Never quite understood why it isn't liked any better .	I already loved " How the Grinch Stole Christmas " when it was released and I'm still loving it now , 5 years later . Still lots of people seem to disagree with my opinion and this movie never really had received much love at the time it came out . Sure , the movie is over-the-top and campy but that at the very same is also the reason why this movie is so charming and fun to watch . All of the sets , costumes and characters are done perfectly over-the-top in a fun way , without ever becoming truly ridicules . It's a visually spectacular movie to watch . It's a campy movie making at its very best ! Director Ron Howard really surprises with this fun little Christmas movie . Main reason why the movie works and why it's so much fun to watch is Jim Carrey as the Grinch . He truly carries the movie with his good and fun role . He is of course helped by the convincing make-up , which also received an Academy Award . Of course if you're a Jim Carrey hater you shouldn't even think about watching this movie . This movie is really his movie and he makes it all work and so much fun to watch . Other fun and memorable roles are being played by Jeffrey Tambor , Clint Howard and Josh Ryan Evans as the young Grinch . The movie has a good morale but it is all a bit sappy to me . Perhaps it's because I'm Dutch and we don't really celebrate Christmas that enthusiastic and big here , as in the United States or England . For me the movie was simply fun and entertaining and the morale just left me quite cold to be honest . The musical score by James Horner is good and fun , even though it's your average every day Horner stuff , it still all works perfectly for the movie and helps to make some of the scene's work . Perfect Christmas entertainment .
One of the weirdest , one of the most inaccessible , one of the greatest !	This is a very interesting and intriguing early movie from acclaimed director David Cronenberg . The movie is definitely not a formulaic standard piece of work . It features lots of odd hallucinating moments , mixed with sadomasochist sex . The movie does reach the point at times , when you're not sure any more if the main character is hallucinating , or if things are real . It give the movie a nightmarish like atmosphere , which is the reason why this movie can be regarded as an horror movie . But it's not a typical horror movie with scare moments , or monsters , or anything like that . It above all is a very imaginative movie that is not alway accessible or easy to understand but always interesting and intriguing to watch . In the beginning its not clear were the movie is heading to . The movie begins as a ' normal ' one , then the movie starts to show sadomasochist and erotic tendencies , before it turns into an hallucinating-trip , filled with gore and violence . The movie can be seen as a one that warns about the ' dangers of television ' when truth and fiction can not be told apart anymore and fiction actually starts becoming reality . It also uses some virtual reality themes to make this point , which was quite unique for 1983 , for no one had really heard about this concept at that time period . It makes the movie futuristic but at the same time also outdated in some of its themes , though the main concept of the movie is still relevant today , perhaps even more than in 1983 was the case . It's definitely not the most accessible movie to watch . It's highly imaginative and also quite odd at times . Yet the movie remains strangely perfectly watchable , even though you never really fully get to understand the things that are going on the movie . The movie chooses to leave many things unexplained and also ends with a suiting open-ending . Andy Warhol was right to call this movie the " A Clockwork Orange " of the ' 80's . The movie does a brilliant job at mixing various different movie styles and combine it into a unique of its own , type of style and atmosphere . Fantasy , horror , mystery , sci-fi , thriller , sex this movie has all those elements in it . The movie is very lively directed by David Cronenberg . His directing is probably the main reason why the movie in the end works out so extremely well . Before this he made mostly B-type of horror movies but with this movie he shows his true skills of greatness . After this 2 other great movies by him were made ; " The Dead Zone " and " The Fly " . Quite unique for a director now days to make three great movies in a row . Cronenberg seems to understand the genres he ventures into but always choose to alter it and provide the movie with an unique style of its own that can not be easily labeled . " Videodrome " is perhaps the very best and most obvious example of this . The only movie that got close to the style and atmosphere of this movie was Cronenberg's own movie " eXistenZ " , that definitely shows some similarities with this movie , also with its themes . " Videodrome " is still Cronenberg's most unique and imaginative work . Of course the movie is also definitely helped by it's visual and hallucinative atmosphere that is filled with lots of gore and violence . It's well made and good looking . It doesn't try to impress , though some of the techniques used in this movie were definitely unique and not done before . I was especially surprised by the gore in the movie . At first it didn't seem that this was going to be a gory one . It seemed more like it was going to be a psychological thriller , with supernatural elements about a ' killer ' TV station . Sort of like " The Ring " . Yet the movie in the end showed more and more gore in a realistic sort of way only Cronenberg can make it . The cast also does a good job at always keeping things realistic , no matter how unusual it all seems and gets . The movie is well written with some good dialog that is greatly delivered by its cast . James Woods does a good job at playing the main character , in a role we'll not easily see him in anymore now days . An unique , great and engaging viewing experience .
Entertaining , action packed movie .	" The Rock " honestly is one of the best action movies made over the last couple of years . It has everything a good action movie needs ; gun fights , explosions and a villainous plot that could kill thousands of people . It's a non-stop entertaining action packed movie . The movie already begins really good and features one of the better movie openings ever . After that the movie never loses its pace and its basically one spectacular action sequence after the other . The movie features some professionally made action sequences that work very well thanks to the nimble cinematography by John Schwartzman the good editing from action movie specialist Richard Francis-Bruce but mainly thanks to the spectacular movie score composed by Nick Glennie-Smith , Hans Zimmer and friends and of course also thanks to the directing of action movie specialist Michael Bay , who always ( well , almost always ) knows how to create an entertaining action filled , blockbuster movie . Difference with most other action movies is that this one features some good and well known actors . Sean Connery shows that he can still handle action roles despite his age and although Nicolas Cage probably wouldn't had been my first choice for the role he plays his role and alright and believable enough . The main ' villain ' is played by the always excellent actor Ed Harris . The rest of the cast consists out of other well known actors such as ; David Morse , John Spencer , John C . McGinley , Steve Harris , Michael Biehn ( in a typical Michael Biehn role ) and uncredited roles played by Xander Berkeley and Stuart Wilson . Some amazingly great casting if you ask me , especially for a type of action movie like this one is . Action movie fans will simply enjoy this movie . Its filled with ' over-the-top ' action sequences featuring lots of gun fights and plenty of big explosions and one memorable car chase scene through the streets of San Fransisco . Everything is almost all of the time very over-the-top but its all done so beautifully over-the-top that it is no complaint . Simply sit back and enjoy !
Character comedy .	This movie is an unique movie that I would describe as a ' character comedy ' . This is not a comedy with forced humor in it , it is a comical , yet ordinary observation of two different people in a strange foreign world , who are growing more and more towards each other . The humor and warm feeling of the movie is in the every day things and the strange but yet realistic characters . This movie is just like real life ; slow and not every thing is always making sense or requires explanation . Sometimes things just happen , whether you like it or not . This is a movie that relies heavily on its two main characters played by Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray , two totally different characters who yet are ' attracted ' to each other . It's obvious that at lot of parts in the movie moments were improvised , especially in the Bill Murray sequences . But somehow director Sofia Coppola manages to restrain Murray ( something that most definitely is not an easy thing to do ) and molds him into the character she want him to be . The fact that Murray perhaps plays the role of his life is thanks to Coppola's directing . Coppola and Murray should definitely make more movies together in the future . It's logical that this movie received an Oscar nomination for best picture , since this type of movie is new and yet works so well and feels so familiar and honest . I'm sure of it that in the near future we will get to see more movies like " Lost in Translation " being made . Perhaps not the must see everyone makes you believe it is but still an unique , warm movie experience that surely is recommendable for everyone to watch , at least once . Chanches are you'll either end up totally loving it , or hating it .
I liked it surprising more than the second one .	Even though I can enjoy the Shrek movies , I just never have a too big fan of it . The first movie was good but also sort of overrated and the second part had too many misses in it . I therefor also expected to not enjoy this third part of the Shrek series and my expectations for it weren't high . Nevertheless I really enjoyed this movie and it was a positive thing that the film-makers this time actually tried out some new things , rather than making this movie a rehearsal of the first 2 Shrek movies . Seems like they stopped with the spoofing this time and went for some originality and creativity of its own . It doesn't make " Shrek the Third " the Shrek movie with the most laughs in it but it also makes it the less forced of the Shrek movies . The previous Shrek basically tried to be constantly funny and often went over-the-top with this . This movie rarely goes over-the-top , perhaps only toward its ending and then mostly with its action . Because the story is more original of its own the movie as a whole also feels fresher and therefor it becomes a pleasant movie to watch , even if it doesn't have the most laughs in it . It must also have got to do with the fact that this movie is directed by different people than those who directed the first two Shrek movies . A good choice to go with different directors , even though its also true that it must have something to do that director of the first two Shrek movies Andrew Adamson is now days a successful live-action film-maker and he is the director of the first two Chronicles of Narnia movies . Technology hasn't stand still since the last Shrek movie , for this Shrek movie is better looking then ever before . The animations are simply flawless and it most be lovely to work with technology like this . The opportunities are basically endless and there are no boundaries . Good thing is that they also didn't introduced too many new characters this time . Basically most characters who also appeared in the first two Shrek movies re-appear in this movie again but in a more restrained way , which assures that this Shrek movie is really about Shrek . Thing I don't like about the Shrek movies is its moralistic undertone and themes . There's always a message in these movies and I feel the movies would be a lot more entertaining if they completely drop this and go for simple pure entertainment instead . All of the Shrek movies have a certain amount of drama in it . I'm just not waiting for this amount of drama whenever I'm watching an animated movie . If they continue making on Shrek movies in the same trend as this movie than " Shrek Goes Fourth " might not turn out to be such a bad movie after all .
Silly British humor . . . I love it !	Fans of British humor pay attention . This short is a must see for you ! This little short mainly of course spoofs " Spider-Man " and " Spider-Man 2 " with lots of typical priceless British humor and with some good well known British comedians in it . I never can really look at Rowan Atkinson and not think about him as Mr . Bean or Blackadder but in this short he was really good and he made me believe he was Peter Piper aka Spider-Plant Man . The movie is filled with many more well known British comedians in small parts such as Mackenzie Crook , Simon Pegg and Tony Robinson who are all very enjoyable in their roles , no matter how small . This little short features some highly good laugh-out-loud moments and is highly enjoyable to watch . Of course you must be able to appreciate British humor in order to find this short funny and enjoyable but then again , who doesn't love British humor ? It's silly , over-the-top and totally ridicules . . . I love it !
They don't make movies like this anymore !	These " old " science fiction movies always have a certain special tension and atmosphere like " 2001 : A Space Odyssey " and " Capricorn One " . Something I sometimes miss in todays movies . Sure the pace is slow , especially the beginning but that's what helps to build up the tension . It certainly makes the race against time ending even more suspenseful . The style of the movie can be called unique . Especially the camera work and editing . It's very experimental , almost Brain De Palma like and I like it a lot . It makes the movie's style special and unique and it adds to the atmosphere . The story is good and is told in such a way that it actually becomes to some extend believable . With the exception of some cliched moments and the ending . The movie begins slow and mysterious and builds up the tension extremely well , while the ending itself is quite spectacular and fast . This also makes the movie special and worth remembering . Some of the scene's you will never forget . The virus itself ( the adromeda strain ) is pretty scary and disturbing , mainly because you don't know what it is or what it does and how it can be stopped . There are also some nice character played by not so well known actors . What's great about the characters is that they all feel very human and not perfect . I like the fact that they don't all like each other and don't always agree . A classic science fiction / thriller that deserves to be better known .
Fun modern western .	This movie uses lot's of ingredients used in classic westerns . It does it in a fun way but it doesn't spoof the classic westerns in any way and it never becomes humorous or a parody that makes fun of the genre . Who would have known , Sharon Stone is a believable cowgirl . I think it's fair for me to say that she's the best I have seen in a western . The movie also features both Russell Crow and Leonardo DiCaprio before their days of fame and big Dollars . It's always fun and great to have Gene Hackman in a villain role and he makes this movie an even more pleasant watch . The movie features lot's of other fun and stereotype western characters . The settings and costumes are great and real western like and help to create the right atmosphere for the movie . The great western score is by Alan Silvestri and fits the movie well , even though the score goes a bit too much " Back to the Future " like at times . The movie is filled with some unusual but great Sam Raimi like cinematography and tricks . Just enjoy and don't pay attention to the story . It is just simple entertainment !
Al Pacino makes it a must see .	Even though this movie ain't no " The Godfather " or " Goodfellas " , this movie is still a bit of a classic because Al Pacino as the famous character Tony Montana . The movie is far from flawless but it still is simply one of those movies you must have seen at least once in your life . Reason for this is simply because of the character Tony Montana and the famous shootout at the ending . This movie once more shows that Al Pacino was and still is one of the best movie actors of all time . I mean this guy played roles like this before but he still manages to play an highly original and memorable character . Further more Michelle Pfeiffer surprised me with her role in this , I never expected to see her in a role like this and was impressed with her . Fans of the gangster genre will absolutely love this movie . However if you are a De Palma fan expecting a typical De Palma movie with De Palma style , you better skip this one . There are only about 2 or 3 typical De Palma moments in the movie but even those moments don't really have De Palma style written over it . There however still is a typical edge-of-your seat De Palma scene in this movie but I won't think that's enough to please the fans . The movie's story is a bit too complex at times , mainly because of the many names mentioned in the movie and the ending , although it is a highly memorable scene is still a bit of a disappointment in terms of that it didn't really fitted the movie . It wasn't the right ending for this movie you may say . The dreadful 80's music makes this movie look more outdated than it really is and Giorgio Moroder's musical score is also not exactly likable or memorable . I'm beginning to sound negative but this movie still is a very good one . Like I said before , if you can appreciate gangster movies you'll absolutely adore this movie . It has some good hard scene's , tough characters and plenty of big guns ( say hello to my little friend ! ) . So basically the movie has everything a good gangster movie needs ! A bit of a classic , because of Pacino and the shootout . See this movie at least once in your lifetime , you won't regret it .
Nice changes making this the best Oscar's ceremony I have seen in a while .	I can't really say I cared much for any of the winners or movies of this ( 2008 ) year but the whole show around it made this one of the best Annual Academy Awards ceremonies of the last couple of years . They definitely made some big changes this year . I liked it's look and the way it brought the audience close to the stage . It was not just like one big room but segmentations were made in the crowd , with the biggest acting nominees sitting in front and the rest of the cast and crew of a particular movie all together in one segment . Even though it was divided , it all still felt more like one , as if everyone in Hollywood forms one big family . It also helped that it didn't feature too many random close-ups of well known actors responses and laughter . Instead it more focused purely on the ceremony alone . The pacing overall was done incredibly well . The show wasn't dragging at any points and it wasn't ever too long or too short during any of its categories . Even the normally slow point of the ceremony , the special honorary award Oscar , was this year over in just a few minutes . Because of this it was a very pleasant watch and it didn't feel like 3 hours at all . It constantly kept going and it also didn't feature presenter Hugh Jackman constantly after an Oscar had been handed out . Also the persons handing out the Oscar's at some occasions handed them out for more than one categories , which again added to the pace . The acting categories had gone to the biggest change , with former winners all presenting the awards , by having a small say about the particular actor and the role he / she played . All of the nominees were obviously touched by this but most people at home still prefer to see a small clip of the particular actor within the movie . Perhaps next year we will see a combination of both these ideas ? I think it was a right choice to let a non-comedian host the Oscar's this time . After all , the night shouldn't be just purely featured around the host but the host should be a person who fills in the blanks and tights the night together . Hugh Jackman did this well . He didn't seemed like the most logic person to host the ceremony this year but I think he surprised a lot of people . And just because he's no comedian doesn't mean he didn't had any funny moments and lines of course . A big problem always was that the acceptance speeches took far too long and the music often suddenly kicked in right in the middle of an acceptance speech , in order to cut the winners off . This year it didn't looked like there was a time limit and this worked out well , for non of the acceptance speeches dragged on . It was also pleasant that there were no politics involved in any of the acceptance speeches , unless you count in the call for more gay right , from the winners that were involved with the movie " Milk " . The evening itself didn't feature too many surprises when it came down to its winners . It can be perhaps said that the presenters this year were more interesting than the winners . " Slumdog Millionaire " and " The Curious Case of Benjamin Button " were the two big favorites but I don't think it surprised many people that it was eventually " Slumdog Millionaire " who took home the most awards and also the ones in the most important categories , including best picture . I also can't really say I cared much for any of the nominated movies this year , which could only mean that 2008 hadn't been a too spectacular year for movies . With all of the current troubles in the world it also can be said that movies and the whole showbiz world have become less interesting for people . Also the writers strike of last year didn't helped to produce many brilliant and Oscar worthy movies . It could be me but it also seems to me that movies , especially big potential Oscar material , got less advertised and hyped . " Slumdog Millionaire " , " Milk " , " The Wrestler " , " The Curious Case of Benjamin Button " were all movies that were just suddenly there and got nominated . Perhaps the biggest surprise was Sean Penn winning out to Mickey Rourke , who almost seemed certain to take home to award for best acting performance . Of course it's not a shame to loose out to Sean Penn though but it was just that Rourke seemed to have lived his entire life to play this particular role in the movie " The Wrestler " . Normally I'm not a too big fan of the person Sean Penn but I must say he surprised me this evening . He seemed very self aware and he was actually looking like he was enjoying the evening . He also had a nice say about gay-rights , which felt honest and sincere from him . Kate Winslet winning and of course Heath Ledger , were all no big surprises and Ledger's win got all of respect from the crowd it deserved . The most toughened persons were brought to tears within the crowd and no doubt also at home , when his family accepted the award on stage . Of course not all of the changes were for the best tough . Although I like the fact that the show featured more musical numbers and also small film segments , not all of the segments really added up to the ceremony . Paying a tribute to 2008's action movies and comedies ? Don't quite see the purpose of it . I like it more when they pay tribute to every movie and actor , from any time , from any genre . Also the life singing during the ' in memoriam ' segment seemed out of place . I'm sure the conductor of the evening Michael Giacchino could had provided something better and more suiting for it . Well done show !
The most realistic vampire movie ever made .	It of course sounds like a silly statement , calling this movie the most realistic vampire ever made , since its very safe to assume that vampires never really excited at all . But that's not what I mean by calling this movie realistic . I mean that it's detailed , it concentrates on the issues what it means to be a vampire , what will it do to you , what's the purpose , how to handle the immortality etcetera . It's far from your average every day vampire movie . It's stylish , detailed and full of deeper meanings and therefor provides us a realistic view at what it means to be a vampire . The movie tells the epic tale of the vampire Louis ( Brad Pitt ) . A vampire who still has a sense of decency and remorse , much to the annoyance of his ' maker ' Lestat ( Tom Cruise ) . Louis is full of questions by which he is torn - and that he wants answered . What follows is a realistic view in the world of vampires . It takes us to the sensual , almost erotic like , world of vampires but also shows us the dark and less pleasant side of the vampire world . Above all " Interview with the Vampire : The Vampire Chronicles " is a very stylish made movie . The movie looks beautiful with nice looking sets and period costumes . Despite being full of deeper meanings and long , poetic like conversations , it yet still always manages to be interesting , as well as at times exciting . What makes the story definitely work are the fine actors that portray the characters . We see Tom Cruise in a role we don't see him often enough in ; that of a villainous character . He plays his character with style and delivers an unforgettable performance . He makes the character Lestat one of the best and most memorable vampires , next to father of all vampire . Dracula himself . I'm quite surprised that he didn't even got an Oscar-nod at least for his role . Also impressive was Kirsten Dunst in an early role . Also she , plays one of her best roles out of her career , at the age of 12 . Other fine well known actors in this movie are Brad Pitt , Christian Slater , Antonio Banderas and Stephen Rea , who is a very underrated and underused actor in my opinion . The beautiful Oscar nominated music is from Elliot Goldenthal , who unfortunately doesn't that often compose more scores like this one . A vampire movie that doesn't concentrate on the formulaic stereotypical vampire movie elements but instead chooses a realistic approach with deeper meanings . Stylish movie with great performances , that is a must-see for every vampire fan .
Huh , a Joel Schumacher film that is actually great ? You better believe it !	This movie was one of the most surprising of the ' 90's . It has a refreshingly original concept and it works great as a social comment . This movie is often being compared to " Taxi Driver " . Although there are some similarities between these two movies , " Taxi Driver " is in a whole different league . " Falling Down " is less heavy and more lighthearted . Although , the fact that the movie here on IMDb is being categorized as a comedy isn't exactly right . The movie is more of a thriller that is brought in a refreshing and not too heavy way but never without loosing its power or without making a statement . Mostly the movie is more of a social comment then anything else . It shows how an more or less average man one day gets fed up with the rotten society and tries to take matters into his own hands , which gets him into some ' unlikely ' but also still somewhat recognizable situations . The movie is told in such a way that it implies that this could happen to every one of us . Therefor it's a bit too bad that toward the ending it becomes more and more obvious that the main character already had psychological problems to begin with . It doesn't really make the movie any less powerful or without making its point clear but its also a sort of an unnecessary addition to the story , that becomes a bit too ' Hollywood-ized ' because of this . The movie its story is nothing too impressive but yet it is refreshing and enough stuff to make you think . It's too bad that Michael Douglas never plays more roles like this . He is excellent in this movie and above all , he is highly believable in his role . I even dare to say that this is one of his very best roles till date . Robert Duvall is also great as the detective . The movie isn't you average ' cop hunts down psychopath who causes mayhem and destruction ' , which it easily could had turned into . I really have the feeling that this is also largely thanks to Robert Duvall , who plays his role very humane and gives his character a certain extra . The events portrayed in the movie might feel a bit too silly and far fetched at times but the movie does makes its points clear . The movie isn't anything too heavy so you can also expect to be entertained . It makes " Falling Down " a perfectly brought and balanced thriller that is refreshingly original , entertains and makes you think as well .
The journalist vs . the senator .	It's already a sort of forgotten subject , the McCarthy-hearings from the early ' 50's , though it perhaps is one of the blackest pages out of the modern American history in which Senator Joseph McCarthy was exploiting the fears of Americans regarding the communist threat , by ( falsly ) accusing hundreds of Americans of all social levels ( without ever presenting proper evidence ) of various Communist activities , on live TV . Nobody dared to oppose him until CBS television journalist Edward R . Murrow and his crew of journalist decided to stand up to him and stop his hearings / investigations by airing opposing documentaries and telling the real ' truth ' to the public about McCarthy and the accusations he made . The fact that this movies dares to touch such a controversial and not much talked about subject is already a reason why the movie is such a fascinating and relevant one to watch . It's a movie about people who dare to stand up to the government and use the powerful tool that media is to do so and deliver its message to the public , fully knowing what the consequences of it for them personally might be . It's inspiring and still applies to certain situations this present day . Clooney definitely is not the most brilliant director but at least he is a daring one . He is not afraid to touch some ( for Americans ) controversial subjects . Not only as a director but also as an actor and producer . He and the movie were rewarded with six Oscar nominations for this . The movie is shot atmospherically entirely in black & white and uses only real archive footage of McCarthy and the hearings , rather than make him a movie character . It suits the atmosphere and the time period the movie is set in . I don't know for some reason black & white movies always are more beautiful to look at and the images better help to tell the story . Thank goodness that there are also still film-makers around that realize this and have the guts to still shoot a movie entirely in black & white . The movie handles some interesting matters , involving several characters . The movie easily could and perhaps also should had lasted 3 hours long , instead of merely 93 minutes . The subject screams for more and a deeper insightful treatment . Some of the elements and characters in the movie are rather raffled unfortunately . The movie is very well cast and has some great actors . David Strathairn is absolutely brilliant in his role and it is without doubt the best role out of his career till date . Clooney also allowed himself to play a small and toned down role in the movie , which absolutely adorns him as a person . Some smaller roles also are there for actors such as Frank Langella , Robert Downey Jr . and Jeff Daniels . In my opinion not a classic must-see but still an essential viewing , due to its subject .
Perhaps not Guillermo del Toro's best but definitely his most ambitious and rewarding movie !	The movie was not as fantasy-filled or imaginative as I had first anticipated . This movie was always being marketed as an adult fairytale , set in a totally imaginative world , with lots of odd but beautiful looking characters . But basically the main character only visits the fairytale-like world on 3 occasions during the movie and the number of characters within the world is actually very limited . I understand the marketing approach and it was not like I was disappointed or missed anything , but just know what to expect when watching this movie . It's more a story of fascist Spain of 1944 , through the eyes of a child , who seeks refugee in her own fantasy , from the evil world and events and characters around her but above all the movie gets still set mostly in the ' real world ' . The movie knows to create a nice and credible mix between the real world events and the fantasy world of Ofelia . Sometimes the two worlds even mix , which also makes the viewer unsure of how much of it is actually real and what is the fantasy of Ofelia . And for people who still think this is a children's movie , which are still quite a lot ; Believe me , it's not ! No people get shot trough the head or are being tortured graphical in a children's movie . This movie is the definition of an adult fairytale . A genre that is not completely new by the way , but will bring many more movies in the near future I hope , after the big success of this movie . Yes , the movie is truly a beautiful looking with , with some good camera-work , production design , make-up effects and its special effects . The movie has the smooth look you would normally expect from a big Hollywood production . But Guillermo del Toro of course is no stranger to this world and type of film-making and has more than enough experience , resources and contacts to make a movie such as this one in his native language as well . It's not hard to see why this movie won 3 Oscars for Best Achievement in Art Direction , Best Achievement in Cinematography and Best Achievement in Makeup . The movie was actually being nominated for 3 more Oscars and it deserved to win at least 2 more of them . The music really deserved a win ! A real crime Gustavo Santaolalla beat Javier Navarrete over this one . But the movie might have the same smoothness of a big Hollywood production , it's everything but a standard Hollywood movie , with all of the formulaic events . The movie is creative in its directing and story-telling . It's makes sure that everything happens as a surprise and you won't ever know or guess what would happen in the next scene or the ending , since this is such an original and far from formulaic movie . So also don't expect a big happy cheerful ending , although some people might still regard the ending is an happy one . It at least is a satisfying one that suits the movie most perfectly imaginable . This is an big project and therefor an heavy burden for the young Ivana Baquero to carry the movie . But she does it and she does it well . Also Sergi López knows to impress , among others . Perhaps not all of the elements are handled well within in the movie and there are some missed opportunities here and there in my opinion , such as a better portrayal of the relationship between Ofelia and Capitán Vidal . Small things like this prevents this movie to me from being an absolute masterpiece or must-see but nevertheless the movie of course remains more than a great one and most definitely also a very creatively original one .
The manipulative Dr . Mabuse .	This is the movie that features one of fist arch-criminals , Dr . Mabuse . A manipulative character , who by hypnosis manipulates people and set them up against each other and steal their money , by letting him play card games against him , while he lets his opponents deliberately loose , even when they have the better cards . He manipulates for more money and the love from respectable woman but also most definitely purely for his own pleasure . It doesn't need to be explained why Dr . Mabuse is evil , he just simply IS . That is what makes a great and memorable movie villain . Definitely true that the second halve of the movie is better than the first . In the second halve the movie really starts to take pace and form . Does it make the first part obsolete ? I think not . It perfectly shows how manipulative Dr . Mabuse and the characters also get strongly developed in it . But yes , it's definitely true that the movie is a long sit . Almost 4 hours is of course a long time ( and there even is a longer version ) . It does not ever make the movie bad or boring but it does make it a bit tiresome at times . The movie also isn't easy to follow but that often is the curse of early narrative full-length movies from the ' 10's and ' 20's of the previous century . For 60 % of the movie , the movie concentrates on card games . Some of the sequence involving the games are made to look more exciting and and tense than in any James Bond movie ever had been the case . The movie uses some good early cinematic ticks and also some interesting storytelling techniques such as some interesting fast flashbacks , to help to remind to the viewer of what happened earlier in the story . The movie also shows some early film-noir tendencies and other thriller and mystery elements . Not just with its story , psychological thriller elements or style of film-making but also with its characters . The main villain Dr . Mabuse is of course the best example of this . He plays an early full-blooded big movie villain , who is also being accompanied by a couple of typical crook-like looking henchmen . All elements that later would become defining for the genre . The movie is about good versus evil , in good early cinematic form . Some of the tricks make sure that the movie is filled with a couple of memorable and effective sequences , mainly regarding the manipulative hypnosis sequences , by Dr . Mabuse . It makes the movie highly imaginative and original , though it all obviously is not as revolutionary as the other Fritz Lang classics ; " Metropolis " and " M " . Of course by todays standards the acting in the movie is definitely over-the-top . Fritz Lang never casted actors just because of their acting skills but also because of their powerful looks . It all helps to make the early acting in Lang movies still fascinating and powerful to watch . Bernhard Goetzke as the state attorney von Welk is a great ' main-hero ' for the movie . Of course Rudolf Klein-Rogge is also great as Dr . Mabuse and so is Alfred Abel , though I liked him in " Metropolis " even better . Definitely worth seeing , if you can handle its long running time .
Fantastic !	This version of " The Phantom of the Opera " is very different from the original and others . But fantastic nevertheless . The movie is approached differently compared to other versions , not only the story is different but also the characters . Especially The Phantom has become a bit of a different person . Personally I like this approach , it's up to you which approach you personally like the best . The typical Terence Fisher directing is very notable and he gives the movie a typical atmosphere . This movie is definitely one of Fisher's and the Hammer studio's best , even though the movie is now days a bit outdated of course . A surprising thing was the amount of humor used in this movie . It fitted the movie surprisingly well and worked out just great . The most fantastic thing is the cast . Herbert Lom plays as The Phantom a more of a tragic villain . Michael Gough as Lord Ambrose d'Arcy plays the real main villain of the movie and he is simply brilliant in his role ! He really steals the show in this one . The rest of the cast also pulls of quite well . Alas there are some flaws and the movie is simply too much outdated to can be considered a masterpiece . But the movie serves its purpose and looks visually great with excellent performances from the cast and a nice finale .
One of the greatest in its genre .	This is more than just a great Bond movie , it also is a great movie on its own . It's well constructed and has a solid , fast paced story , with some great memorable action sequences and characters in it . This movie is quite different from other Bond movies in many regards . First and foremost reason of course for this , is that this movie is the second Bond movie ever made . The creators obviously tried to surpass the success of " Dr . No " and make this movie an even bigger and spectacular one . They certainly succeeded in this but it also means that this movie is at times lacking in its special ' Bond ' kind of feeling . Sure it has Q , M , Moneypenny and gadgets but its not as fun to watch , mainly because the movie obviously tries to take itself as serious as possible . However none of this matters , since it makes this movie a really good genre movie and quite frankly one of the best ever created . Also keep in mind that back in the early ' 60's there wasn't really an ' action-movie genre ' yet . That probably is also the reason why this movie feels quite different from other movies genre - and also later Bond movies in particular . Overall the older Bond movies are of better and higher quality than all of the later ones , of course with some exceptions left out here and there . My theory is that it is because the early movies still take themselves serious , while all of the most other later Bond movies go over-the-top with its action mainly . Basically the Bond character himself also fits better in a ' 60's atmosphere , also obviously due to the way how he handles women . Nothing wrong with Bond movies these days , after all I enjoy ( most ) of them highly and they serve as good mindless entertainment , especially the Roger Moore Bond-films but honestly , they can't beat the oldies . Unlike many other Bond movies , the story plays a significant part in the movie . At first its slow without any action but thanks to its fast and spot on pace the movie still is exciting to watch . Surprisingly the movie at the end still turns into a spectacular one , when lots of action occurs on screen . The boat and the later following helicopter chase sequences are one of the best and most memorable Bond action sequences ever . They are surprisingly big and spectacular . But also the confrontation sequences between Grant and Bond are memorable and spectacular , even when no action occurs . Kudos to Sean Connery and Robert Shaw's acting for that . What makes this Bond movie also a highly memorable one are its characters . The villain always is an important element of a Bond movie . This movie its main villain is Ernst Stavro Blofeld of SPECTRE but as we are used of him , he doesn't get to do any action . Real ' action ' villains of this movie are the hit-man Grant ( Robert Shaw ) and Rosa Klebb ( Lotte Lenya ) , a former Russian she-man colonel now working for SPRECTRE , who has lesbian tendencies and pointy shoes . Both of them are portrayed by some very solid actors , which helps to make them both very memorable Bond villains . Especially Shaw is wonderful . In the first halve of the movie he doesn't say a word but from the moment he meets up with Bond and starts to speak his character becomes a different one and Shaw's acting ability and versatility becomes obvious . Also look out for Walter Gotell , who plays a small part as a villain in this movie but later went on playing the Russian general Gogol , who appeared in numerous Bond movies over the years . But not just the villains are great . Pedro Armendáriz plays a real good and likable ' criminal ' character , in his final role . Daniela Bianchi is a good Bond girl . Nothing too spectacular , she just mainly serves her purpose well . It also of course helps the movie that it has Bond regulars Miss Moneypenny ( Lois Maxwell ) , Q ( Desmond Llewelyn ) and M ( Bernard Lee ) in it , who would all later re-appear in more than a dozen more Bond films . This is simply one of those movies in which everything just adds up and works well . The pace is incredibly good and makes the movie even tense and spectacular to watch when no action occurs . The acting and characters are great and the movie is big in spectacular in its action . Everything in this movie fits and it helps to make this one of the best and most memorable Bond movies but also one of the best and earliest action genre movies ever made .
The " Goodfellas " of the ' 30's .	This is a very early movie within the gangster / crime genre . The movie was so early that it was afraid it could have a bad influence on people and put a disclaimer before the start of the movie , telling that this is not a movie that glorifies being an hoodlum . Movies such as " Scarface " ( 1932 ) and " The Roaring Twenties " would follow after this movie . As an early movie it was of course a sort of a trend setter and laid out the path for future genre movies , along with other gangster movies from the same time period , made before the film-noir period . I'm calling it the " Goodfellas " of the ' 30's since the two movies definitely show similarities to each other story-wise and storytelling-wise . The movie focuses on a man who from a kid on slowly climbs up the criminal ladder , during the prohibition period in Chicago . It begins small , with ' simple ' beating-ups and selling illegal booze but it soon escalates into one big mob war . The movie is featuring some quite explicit ( at least for its time ) violence ( slapping woman for instance ) and the main character sleeps around with different women . Yes , it's obviously a pre-code movie ! I absolutely loved the story and how it progressed . It took its time to set up the characters and its relations . No big surprise that the screenplay got nominated for an Oscar . It has some great typical genre moments and some unforgettable sequences and one wonderful suiting ending . It's a really effective movie , that works on many levels . It features James Cagney in one of his firs movie roles and his first real leading role . He was original set to play the character of Matt Doyle ( now portrayed by Edward Woods in the movie ) but director William A . Wellman ( also director of the first ever Oscar-winning movie " Wings " . ) was so impressed with Cagney during the rehearsals that he gave him the main part instead . A wonderful move as turned out later . James Cagney also became an huge star later and was mostly known for playing touch criminal hoodlum's , as he also does in this movie . Besides James Cagney the movie also features Jean Harlow in an early big and talking role . I loved how the movie had some extremely good and effective camera-work , featuring some wonderful looking compositions . A really great early gangster-movie !
A gangster movie with a humane face .	It's mostly a movie that is made great by its Oscar-nominated story . It's a typical ' 30's gangster movie only with a more humane and dramatic twist to it , in which two childhood friends find each other on the other side of the law , despite still having a strong friendship . It's not necessarily Michael Curtiz his best directed movie and it also doesn't feature Cagney or Bogart in their best or most memorable roles but it nevertheless is one great solid movie , that you'll not easily forget . The movie might sound like a really preachy and moralistic one that condemns violence and says that is's better to come to church . Even though this perhaps in a nutshell is still what this movie is all about , the movie itself luckily doesn't ever get preachy or moralistic like . This is not just due to the fine written of the movie but also thanks to the performances of the lead actors , that mostly make the movie and its story work out so effectively and realistic . Humphrey Bogart plays a sort of villainous gangster role in this one . He really wasn't an established actor yet back then and he's also third billed actor for this movie . It really wasn't until the ' 40's that he really finally had his big breakthrough and became an established actor and started playing leading roles in some big well known successful movies , such as of course " Casablanca " and " The Maltese Falcon " . But of course the human face of the movie is being provided by James Cagney , who shows the realistic and human side of a tough hoodlum . Cagney is mostly known for his tough roles of course but he could also really play some more ' soft ' characters and he actually starred in some musicals and romantic movies as well during his career . The other main part of the movie is being played by Pat O'Brien , a former tough guy from the neighborhood who used to hang out with the Cagney character but has now turned into a priest . Even though O'Brein isn't now days as well known as Cagney or Bogart , he still was a big and well known actor , especially during the ' 30's and ' 40's . He actually played in a total of 9 movies together with Cagney and 5 with Bogart , often in front of Bogart as the movie's main lead . Gangster movies was popular genre in the ' 30's , with other genre examples such as " Little Caesar " , " The Public Enemy " and " Scarface , the Shame of the Nation " being released during the same decade . Especially Warner Bros . was leading with it . Nevertheless , " Angels with Dirty Faces " is still a movie that knows to be different and original within its genre . It's the story that makes this movie original as well as effective and memorable . Especially the ending is great and memorable . The movie constantly kept me waiting for the trademark Michael Curtiz use of shadows during its key moments but there it finally was at the ending . Lots of things come together at the end and it makes the movie as a whole an even better and more powerful one . Even more so than it already was before that point . Besides its writing , the movie also received Oscar nominations for its directing , by Michael Curtiz and James Cagney for his role of Rocky Sullivan . It was Cagney's first ever Oscar nomination and he actually won his only Oscar 4 years later for his role in " Yankee Doodle Dandy " , which also got directed by Michael Curtiz . " Angels with Dirty Faces " is more dramatic , more involving and therefor perhaps also more memorable than the usual ' 30's gangster movie .
Surprising good ' unknown ' early Hitchcock movie .	This is one fine early Hitchcock and early thriller movie , with one fine story in which the movie its main character is always one the run for somebody . Because I had never heard about this movie before , my expectations for it weren't too high , despite the fact that it was directed by no other than Alfred Hitchcock . Early Hitchcock movies I had already seen were good but were also always lacking a thing or two , preventing the movies from being true great genre classics or making any of them among Hitckcock's best work . Nevertheless this movie turned out to be surprisingly great and despite some of flaws it's a real great early Hitchcock movie from 1935 . Like expected the cinematography for this movie was great . You can thrust Hitchcock on always featuring some great and innovative cinematography in any of his movies . Also the fast editing makes this a fast going and well flowing movie . It's mostly the thing that makes this movie so great and perhaps even make it seem a bit ahead of its time . It nevertheless is still an at times slow going movie due to its story but this is the case with basically every ' 30's movie . It otherwise is one fine and intriguing thriller story with mystery elements thrown into it . It's a movie in which the main character is constantly on the run for somebody . You can say that this is the ' 30's version of " The Bourne Identity " . It makes this movie always on the move and it's something that Hitchcock often would let feature in his movies . Besides that this movie of course also featuring lots of other different typical Hitchock elements such as stairs , a cameo by the man himself and amazing unmatched suspense . His more earlier movies from the ' 30's and ' 40's are not as well known as his later movies from the ' 50's and ' 60's but most of them are just as good , especially considering that they got made in the earlier days of cinema , when thriller movies and such were still pretty much in their early beginning stages . Despite the fact that the movie has no well known actors in it , a ll of the actors suit their roles well and did a good job . It really shows that Hitchcock was a great actor-director as well . A great and entertaining early spy-thriller , that still holds up very well this present day !
A genuinely scary movie .	This movie is so very effective and just overall excellent due to its minimalism . Little is explained , little is ever shown and the story also isn't the most complex written one . Out of all the horror movies I've seen I can honestly say that this is one of the genuinely scary ones . It still is the best ' haunted house ' movie ever made . It's a movie that puts its emphasis more on its atmosphere than anything else really . The movie knows to create an uneasy atmosphere with its slow but steady build up . It really knows to pick its moments to put in a scary moment . But even then the movie shows very little . It's a movie filled with scary sounds , which adds to the mystery and tension of the movie . It's really a movie that works out due to its talents behind the camera's . I was surprised by the movie its camera-handling and fast editing work at times . They did a really great job with this and it really helped the movie to work out with its moments . It's a technically really well made movie , that of course also is being helped by the fact that it was shot in black & white . It gives the movie a more eerie and unpleasant atmosphere . It also really helps to bring the house to life , from both the outside as well as the inside . Horror wasn't really the most glamorous genre to work in during the ' 60's but just like Robert Wise did with " The Day the Earth Stood Still " he takes a genre to a totally different and far classier level , when compared to other genre movies from the same time period . This is what I always mostly admire about Robert Wise . He takes on a genre with his own touch and vision , with as a result an unique , as well as highly effective movie . The movie has some really effective genre moments , that will shock and will leave you with an unpleasant feeling afterward , without ever having to feature any blood or gore or anything of that sort . One moment especially really caught me off guard and in my book is one of the most scary shock moments in movie history . It's more of a slow and subtle version , that might not be for everyone but for those who are able to sit through a more of a slow and old fashioned genre movie , the movie will be a real rewarding one .
Beautiful slow character portrayal .	" Sling Blade " is a movie with an incredible great main character in it . Billy Bob Thornton truly portrays a memorable movie character that delivers some memorable lines . It's a role you normally wouldn't expect to see him in . The movie has a beautiful story that has lots of heart in it . It's told in a perfect slow way , which helps to make some of the dramatic scene's really powerful . It's a depressing movie to watch , which means that it's powerful and everything in it works good . I wish more little movies like this were made . There are many long sequences with only one camera-positions that show all of the actors their fine acting skills . Thorton impressed me and he deserved his Oscar nomination . Other fine roles are played by Dwight Yoakam , John Ritter and Natalie Canerday . Some small roles are played by J . T . Walsh and Robert Duvall . Robert Duvall has a very small role and few lines but still you can tell by looking at the scene that he is a terrific actor and makes the short scene a quite powerful one . Unfortunately Lucas Black isn't the greatest child actor I have ever seen but I think it's unfair to just judge him by this movie . This movie is an incredible hard one for a child actor to play in . The main character is really the reason why this movie works and why it's so good and powerful to watch but it's the combination of the characters and the story that makes this movie a true must see for everyone .
The best one out of the series .	This is just one of those movies that , no matter how many times I've watched it , is an hilarious comedy that genuinely makes me laugh . What I often love about Blake Edwards ' comedies is his almost cartoon like approach of it . This is like a life action road runner / Wile E . Coyote movie . Along with " The Great Race " this is perhaps his most cartoon like comedy . The slapstick and timing of it in this movie is amazing and it of course also obviously work out due to the comical brilliance of Peter Sellers . Out of all the Pink Panther movies this is the one with the most laughs and classic comical moments in it . Great moments such as the slow motion fight between Clouseau & Cato ( it's the best Clouseau vs . Cato fights out of the whole series ) , in which Dreyfus also somehow gets involved , the Oktoberfest sequence , the questioning of the staff , Clouseau trying to enter the château , Clouseau disguised as a dentist and I'm sure I'm forgetting many more great sequences . It are all moments that just bound to make you laugh , even if you really don't want to . For the comedy and the story itself is actually quite lame and predictable . You can often see things coming from miles away but this seriously doesn't make it any less funny to watch . Perhaps its even somehow part of the reason why it works out so incredibly hilarious . It's obvious that Blade Edwards and Peter Sellers both were lovers and inspired by the slapstick comedies of the ' 20's and early ' 30's . This movie features the same type of comical approach but not in an old fashioned way . The Clouseau character is still ' modern ' and the approach original , even if it all has done somewhere else before . Of course most credit goes to Peter Sellers . He was a brilliant comedian who never tried to be funny but simply just was funny . The way he handles all of the comedy within this movie is just brilliant . It are not just the antics but also the accent and other small subtle things that made him great and turned Chief Insp . Jacques Clouseau into an absolute classic comedy character . Even if you've never seen a Pink Panther movie you still know who Jacques Clouseau is . But also the other actors deserve credit . Especially Herbert Lom , who just as Sellers doesn't try to be funny and instead plays a mean hateful character , who at the same time is of course totally hilarious . He is especially great in the scenes with Sellers , the two of them had some great interaction and chemistry together . If you've never seen a Pink Panther movie and you have to see just one , be sure to watch this one . It's the absolute best and most hilarious one !
The kind of movie I thought that didn't got made anymore .	' They don't make them like this anymore ' is a much uses expression when saying something about a classy ' 40's epic . " There Will Be Blood " however is just a movie like that . Appearantly there are still directors around with the talent to bring back the old feeling of a brilliant epic from the early days of cinema , with the same style and approach of things , that might seem slow and old fashioned for some people but are a real treat for the lovers of cinema . " There Will Be Blood " is a slow but real intriguing and very detailed portrayed of a man . It's like an autobiographic movie without being based on an actual person ( well , not 100 % fully ) . Just like in real life he faces some extreme ups and downs , of which the downs are of course the real interesting aspects of the movie . It's a real powerful movie to watch , even when there is actually very little happening . It's a movie made with such an eye for detail that this becomes a subtly brilliant movie . ' When ambition meets faith ' is a great tag-line for the movie . It really describes what the movie is about . It's main character is a real driven one that has aspiring ambitions but countless times he's being pulled down by events and people around him , even when things are going really well for him . He basically sacrifices his entire life , without giving his actual life , for reaching his goal . When he has eventually reached that goal life is also empty for him . The movie is a great character study of a greedy man , who of course also still has an heart and soul . Of course the movie is almost completely being driven by Daniel Day-Lewis . He for 90 % basically makes this entire movie . Without him there also truly wouldn't had been " There Will Be Blood " . Like always he really becomes the character , which is perhaps even a bit scary at times to see him get into his role so deeply . As expected he also won an Oscar for his role . Whenever Daniel Day-Lewis plays a role like this one there simply is no other competition for him . Most of the time he also completely plays all of his fellow actor from the screen in this movie , which perhaps sounds as a compliment but actually is more a bit of a complaint . He lets some of the other fine actors look bad , of which the movie doesn't benefit . Luckily though the movie is purely about Daniel Day-Lewis for 90 % of the time , making the complaint not much of a complaint anyway . But of course Paul Thomas Anderson shouldn't be forgotten . After all he is the man that had the guts to directed this movie , that isn't exactly mainstream in its core but nevertheless became a modest box office hit due to his professional skills . The movie won lots of awards , which of course wasn't just due to Daniel Day-Lewis his performance . Paul Thomas Anderson is a real talented director who really knows how to tell a story powerful , effective and intriguing , even when in its core the story might seem far from any of that . He proved this before with movies such as " Magnolia " and " Boogie Nights " . " There Will Be Blood " however still remains his most grand and epic production as of yet . It's also a real beautiful looking . The movie does a very good job at creating a very authentic look and atmosphere for the story that is set at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th . The movie is gritty and dark and has a depressing look without ever giving you a depressing feeling . The movie also really deserved its Oscar which it won for its cinematography . The movie was nominated for a total of 8 Oscar's , making it one of the big movies of 2007 . It won only 2 Oscar's though and lost out its most important awards to the hit-movie " No Country for Old Man " . A great unique movie made in the style and tradition of the movies from the ' good old days ' .
Finally a clever science-fiction movie again that works .	There have been some ( unsuccesful ) attempts the past few years ( such as " Solaris " and " Mission to Mars " . ) but lets face it , science-fiction movies now days mostly means flying space ships constantly battling each other and freaky looking aliens who try to take over the world , instead of the deeper and more philosophical approach . Nothing wrong with that sort of entertainment but it's refreshing to see that still good and clever science-fiction movies can be made , combined with the techniques of this decade . It really makes " Sunshine " one of the best science-fiction movies since years and I was pleasantly surprised by it . The movie features basically every cliché you can think of with this genre and it of course also makes the movie in parts predictable but it does a good job with combining it all and it works out really well thanks to the lively and original directing from Danny Boyle that is somewhere between spectacular and philosophical but always in its own style . The movie is a great blend between tense and spectacular action and clever written moments . This movie picks all kind of approaches from mystery , to tension , to action and it all works out effectively . Basically this movie has everything in it it needs to make a great movie with . It's tense , spectacular looking , has a mysterious theme in it and a sniff of romance . In other words ; all the ingredients to have a great time with . It's a movie that entertains and thrills and is a feast for all your senses . The movie is incredible good looking . Outer space has never looked so impressive and huge before . The visual effects are amazing and in a way also are the core of the movie . The special effects are everywhere , the establishing shots , the spectacular moments , the beautiful moments . They are just basically always present and a reason why this movie works out so well is because of its visual look , in which the special effects play such an important part . It of course can be all best experienced on the big screen . Has there ever been a movie before in which the sun played such a prominent role ? It almost becomes a character in the movie and it of course plays the biggest part in the movie , since it's all about the sun . In fact the story isn't really that much special or even original but the approach of it all makes this movie a refreshing one nevertheless , that is a great one to experience . How much things can you actually come up with , with a group of astronauts aboard a space ship on mission to re-ignite the dying sun . The movie comes up with some really well thought out and executed moments , that really are some edge-of-your-seat stuff at times . It's a greatly layered movie with themes in that can be interpreted in many different deeper ways , though it's also true that the movie toward the end becomes more formulaic and picks the more simplistic approach . And yes , it's definitely true that the movie is not terribly original with its themes and characters but nevertheless the execution and especially the visual look of it all still makes this movie one that is worth seeing , even if you've already seen all of the science-fiction movies this movie obviously was inspired by ( such as " 2001 : A Space Odyssey " and " Alien " . ) . The movie really isn't the most original one but yet it feels like a totally new experience . What I also love about the movie is that it does a good job at not picking one main character but instead focus evenly on all the characters aboard the space ship , even though you can say that Cillian Murphy plays the main character of the movie . It gives everyone a lot of screen time and doesn't really make any of them a secondary character for in the background with meaningless lines . It also makes all of the characters well developed , despite the fact that they all are quite formulaic . Also a reason why their characters work out is because of the top-class acting , from some well known but also lesser known actors . Not one actor in the movie disappoints and they all did a great job . It shows that Danny Boyle is a real actor-directing but also a director who knows how to tell a story without the actors but with lots of style and flair . A great , mysterious , tense , spectacular but above all also really well made beautiful movie experience that you really have to experience for your self .
Mission succeeded !	" Mission : Impossible " is next to " Heat " known as the action movie with very few action in it . The main reason why the movie got criticized was because of the complex story which no normal human seemed to understand . Well , let me say this , after watching it about 5 times you will understand it completely and you don't even understand anymore why you didn't got it the first time . But even without fully understanding the movie you can very much appreciate this movie , like also I did the first time I saw it . The movie even is enjoyable for the Brian De Palma hater . His style is present ( so there also is enough to enjoy for the De Palma fans , like myself ) but not in such a way that it distracts in any way for the more casual viewer . Venessa Redgrave and Tom Cruise really seemed to be enjoying themselves playing together in this movie . You can tell they had lots of fun in their scene's which for me makes those scene's really enjoyable to watch . But again there is also plenty to enjoy for the more casual viewer . The exciting CIA break in is already a classic and the spectacular ending on the TGV also doesn't disappoint . The music from Danny Elfman is typically his style and suits the movie surprising well , he delivers one of this best works till date . " Mission : Impossible " deserves more credit than it gets . Don't let the complex story scare you of .
Action movie storytelling - Kurosawa style .	Akira Kurosawa has got to be one of the most influential and inspiring movie-directors of all time . Back in 1958 , there wasn't really an action movie genre . This was before movies like " North by Northwest " and " Dr . No " were made , which both probably are the most influential and earliest ' modern ' form action movies . The action movie genre had yet to be given its trusted form with its formulaic elements in it back in 1958 . This movie is obviously an early step toward ' modern ' action movies and it obviously inspired many later movies , both action movies as well as movies in other genres . Of course the most notable and best known example of this is the first Star Wars trilogy . Lucas was obviously inspired by this movie and he uses several plot elements , characters treatment and sequences from this movie in his Star Wars movies . Some references are more notable than the others and you'll probably discover new similarities on every new viewing . The story is simple but it's made unique through its storytelling . Instead of focusing on the main big heroic character , the main characters of the movie are two simple greedy peasants . The story is mostly told from their point of view which gives the story a whole different and interesting new dimension . It's a surprising and perhaps even daring approach of film-making but it works surprisingly well . It's not the story that makes this movie an unique one but it's truly the way of storytelling that does . The characters are constantly on the move or traveling , which gives the movie an extra sense of adventure . The whole way of acting looks totally different than the acting from European countries , America and the rest of the world . The style of acting might look a bit weird and perhaps also over-the-top these days , especially since we're simply just not accustomed to this way of acting . It gives the movie a style and feeling of its own but it at the same time makes the movie quite hard and not always as likable to watch . But the actors did their job and they served the story well , especially Toshirô Mifune , who always is a pleasure to watch in a Kurosawa movie . All of the characters are given a very strong own personality in the movie . The setting in the movie are beautiful and the cinematography is good and nimble . Masaru Satô delivers a fine musical score for the movie , that fits the movie and its atmosphere like a glove . The movie has some great action sequences in it , that maybe are not too big or grand to watch but the way they are captured on screen and put in the story makes them very spectacular and awesome to watch at the very same time . The whole spear fight after the already fantastic chase sequence was an absolute highlight for me . It was absolutely brilliantly directed , timed and choreographed . Perhaps one of the very best and certainly most memorable directed sequence from Kurosawa . Of course there is plenty more action to enjoy in this movie , although perhaps not as much as you would expect at first sight . The movie is more adventurous and entertain than action-filled to watch . Yet again Kurosawa does not disappoint and delivers a masterpiece in his own unique way and with his own unique style . This movie is perhaps also more accessible than his other , mainly earlier , movies and the movie will surely entertain , even when you're not familiar with other Kurosawa movies or his style of movie-making and storytelling .
Realistic movie with a gripping and gritty story .	The movie tells the true story of Frank ' Paco ' Serpico who was about the only honest cop of the entire New York police department at his time . The movie provides a realistic view in the corrupt and tough world of the New York police and tells the story of Serpico in an intriguing and realistic , perhaps maybe even documentary like way . " Serpico " is a movie with a typical fantastic ' 70's atmosphere and it's a movie that still holds up today . This is mainly thanks to the fantastic story of the movie and the way it is told . Yep , they really don't make movies like this anymore . I think " Serpico " may already be regarded as a ' classic ' . Actually the story itself or concept isn't that terribly original compared to many other movies from the same period . Still this movie distinct itself from most of those movies , thanks to the perfect directing from Sidney Lumet . Also Pacino's acting and the fact that his movie is based on a true story makes this movie better than most others . Lumet and Pacino continued working together and later made the even better " Dog Day Afternoon " together . But fair is fair , even though Pacino is fantastic , this is far from his best role . The ' explosion ' he later used for his characters in movies is still missing here and it seems like he's holding back . I also think that his Oscar nomination he deserved for this movie was also a bit too much credit for him . Pacino was just a young beginning actor at the time ( He had just done his first big role and movie ; " The Godfather " . ) and he obviously had still a lot of learning to do . The rest of the cast consists out of unknown actors ( with the exception of apparently Oscar winner F . Murray Abraham in one of his first small movie roles , to be honest I didn't even noticed him . ) but for a movie like this a cast with unknown actors work really well . It keeps the focus on the movie's its intriguing story better . Apparently there is a lot of hate for it but I really liked the musical score by Mikis Theodorakis . It was really fitting with the movie its atmosphere . All in all this is a already ' classic ' typical ' 70's cop flick in the style of , for instance " The French Connection " and is an absolute must see .
An original new kind of horror movie .	With the coming of " The Sixth Sense " M . Night Shyamalan ( how to pronounce it , I have no idea ! ) introduced a new kind of horror . The kind of horror that is more psychological than it is scary , although " The Sixth Sense " still has some good scares ! The movie inspired many other movies like for example " The Others " with Nicole Kidman but also M . Night Shyamalan kept making movies in this new kind of horror style , movies like " Signs " and his most recent one " The Village " . It's hard to say what it is that makes this movie such a masterpiece . It might be because of the superb mix of drama , thriller and horror elements . A thing why all these elements flow so well isn't only thanks to the directing but also due to the acting . Bruce Willis shows that he is a good actor and can also play a character without guns . Toni Collette is also good and warming as troubled mother but real discovery of the movie is of course Haley Joel Osment . He is more than just a child actor , he is a real actor ! He really deserved his Oscar nomination for this movie and I wouldn't had mind him seeing winning it . Oh well , his hopefully his time will come , after all he is only just 16 now . The movie got nominated for 5 more Oscars including best picture and best director . The movie eventually went home empty handed , a shame because the movie deserved at least an Oscar nod . Already trademark M . Night Shyamalan element in a movie is the surprise ending . " The Sixth Sense " does have a good surprise ending , it's a kind of ending that makes you want to see the movie again after you finished watching it for the first time . Although not my favorite movie surprise ending of all time , it sure comes close to it ! See this movie for the tension the drama and the surprise ending .
A forgotten Disney masterpiece .	This is probably one of the most unknown Disney classic . For the time the movie was quite new and revolutionary and it doesn't quite fit in with the other movies Disney made in that period . , perhaps that's the reason why it has been forgotten . But " The Great Mouse Detective " deserves to be known and seen . The characters are real classics and one of the best to have ever appeared in a Disney movie . Actually Professor Ratigan ( voiced by the legendary Vincent Price ) is quite possibly my favorite movie villain of all time . No wonder that it was Vincent Price's favorite role . His style and humor is priceless and it cracks me up every time . But the other characters are also very memorable . I especially like the character of doctor Dawson . The story is good and very pleasant and very mature compared to other Disney's from that period . But of course the idea of making a story about the mouse version of Sherlock Holmes alone is already good enough to make a fun movie about . One of the other things that makes this movie different compared to other Disney's from that period are the songs or better said the lack of it . The movie features only one song ( 3 if you count the bar song and the goodbye , so soon song . ) . But it's not a miss . The surprising magnificent musical score by famous composer Henry Mancini make up for this loss . The movie has a very spectacular final on and in the famous Big Ben . It's by far my favorite Disney movie ending . Certainly a fun movie to watch over and over again . P . S . : If you're Dutch speaking , I highly recommend that you watch this movie Dutch spoken . Believe it or not it's even better and more fun then the English version ! Believe me , just give it a shot .
Horror with depth .	This movie is absolutely beautiful ! The story is highly original ( especially considering that this is a sequel ) and extremely well executed . I'm not sure if its fair to call it better than its predecessor " Frankenstein " , since the both are hard to compare in my opinion . They are different of each other in quite some ways but both of them are brilliant in their own way . Karloff most definitely seems more at ease in his role this time and he's not overacting anymore . He plays the monster with some real passion and eye for detail . His make-up also looks better than ever . Still I think it's a bit of a shame that so many actors from the original " Frankenstein " didn't reprise their role in this movie . Lot's of the characters are played by different actors this time . But I'm surely glad that Colin Clive returned as Dr . Henry Frankenstein . I already really loved him in " Frankenstein " and I enjoyed him once more in this movie . An underrated actor that died too young . The emotions are once more very real and extremely powerful . The scene were the monster makes friendship with the blind man is unforgettable and truly a powerful sequence . The movie is really more than just a mere horror movie , it's a powerful cinematic masterpiece with some real depth . A beautiful and powerful movie .
Perhaps the most perfect Laurel & Hardy comical short .	I absolute adore this movie . It's quite a dark comical one but still features all of the typical humor and slapstick moments . Finally the boys meet some persons who are even crazier than they are . Mae Busch as the widow and Jack Barty as Jitters are some real good crazy and scary persons . They give the boys a hard time and the movie does actually succeed in making the movie tense and unpredictable . Normally it aren't the supporting actors who make a Laurel & Hardy short to be a classic and comical one but this movie is truly an exception to that . Honestly there isn't a thing that I dislike about this movie so that is why I regarded as the most perfect Laurel & Hardy short . A must-see !
A rare ' serious ' science-fiction movie from the ' 50's .	Let's face it , most of the science-fiction movies made in the ' 50's were utter trash . When you think of ' 50's science-fiction movies , you think of Ed Wood like movies with laughable special effects , a weak story and below average B-movie stars and persons in rubber-suits . Not really the kind of movie to take very seriously . But yes , luckily " The Thing from Another World " is a rare exception . OK I'll admit that the story itself is still quite ridicules at times . I mean , the alien is basically explained in the movie as being a large vegetable . It does make the movie a bit too silly and certainly outdated to watch at times . But then again on the other hand , " The Thing from Another World " is still very different from other science-fiction movies from the same period , in a positive way . The movie is unique and differers from others in multiple ways . It even in some regard was quite ahead of its time and it inspired many other horror / science-fiction movie later to come . The characters in the movie are all portrayed as strong individual characters with their own thoughts and emotions . It does give the movie a certain sense of realism , even though the story itself is of course far from being realistic . The movie also features a typical scientific - versus military way of thinking . That concept is not unique and is also still often featured in movie made this present day but the way that it is handled in this movie is extremely well and it does provide the movie with some tense and unpredictable moments . Also the way the ' monster ' , or in this case rather said the alien is handled is quite unique . The alien itself doesn't actually play such a prominent role in the movie in terms of how often and how long it appears on screen . The alien is never seen in close-up which adds to the suspense and mystery of the movie . Of course the look of the alien is by today's standards terribly outdated but that now has become part of the charm of the movie . The fact that he more often is off the screen rather than on it , provides the movie with some good and tense moments and also the moments that he does pop-up make provides the movie with some good scares ( atleast for ' 50's standards that is . ) because you don't really expect it . Kind of like the same way the tension in " Jaws " is build up . Another thing , which I thought was absolutely great about this movie was the dialog . The dialog fits all of the characters extremely well and helps to add to their own strong individual personality . The actors which portray them are perhaps not the great but thanks to the dialog all of them are extremely believable and fitting in their roles . The storytelling is slow yet the pace is high . The movie takes its time to build up the story and introduce the characters , which all yet again add to the ' realism ' of the movie . The way the story is told makes the movie seem even more mysterious and tenser than the story really is . I also like the way everything in the movie is scientifically explained , something that most often in movies like these never was the case . " The Thing from Another World " is an unique , influential and in many ways a movie that was ahead of its time in terms of character treatment and storytelling . Therefor this movie is a marvelous one , that will be enjoyed by all but probably especially mainly by the movie-buffs among us . Either way , a highly recommendable movie for all !
One of the most beautiful movies ever made .	This is certainly one of the most beautiful movies ever made . Beautiful is of course something totally different than saying ' this is the best movie ever made ' . With beautiful I mean that the movie is superbly looking with flawless costumes and sets and impressive landscapes and camera-work . And please lets also not forget the beautiful and perfect use of classical music that was all rearranged by composer Leonard Rosenman , for which he also received an Oscar . Same goes for the flawless art-direction , cinematography and costume design . Truly all the Oscars that it at least deserved to get . " Barry Lyndon " is a long movie , like Kubrick movies often are . A lot is happening in the story but it never gets to much because the story is told in a slow way . Almost the entire life of the character Redmond Barry / Barry Lyndon is told in the movie . As a sort of Irish 18th century Forrest Gump he travels and sees Europe through the eyes of many different sides . It gives a great view and feel of the 18th century Europe and the British ' gentleman ' culture in particular . There is some absolutely stunning dialog in the movie . It's this typical old fashioned English polite way of talking that is used in this movie . It was a real joy to listen to and it provided some highly entertaining and memorable moments at times . The lines are all perfectly delivered by the fine actors . It was also great to see Pat Roach in this movie . Pat Roach is known for playing almost every of the big thugs in all the Indiana Jones movies . It's funny , I didn't recognized him by his face or voice but I did by his style of fighting . He fought in the same manner as he later did in " Raiders of the Lost Ark " during the airplane fight . The story is told slowly and beautifully and is all beautiful narrated by Michael Hordern . You'll never be bored while watching this movie , I can guarantee that . There is simply too much happening in this movie to allow that . An absolutely beautiful movie that also is an absolute must see .
